# History of Farm Carillon Goes Back to August 1914
## 
### 
Stanford's bells tell a moving story that began in August 1914 with a
ringing telephone bell. A distracted American consul in London was calling
a young Stanford engineer. Thousands of American refugees were stranded
without money, friends, or food in strange lands ablaze with war. Would
Mr. Hoover help send them home?
That young engineer, Herbert Hoover, did this job so well that he was

given a harder oneâ€”the administra
tion of relief to the people of Bel
gium and Northern France. This aid.
begun during the dark days of war
; ind continued during the reconstruc
tion of Belgium's devastated towns
and universities, laid a deep founda
tion of friendship between the two
peoples.
Memorial of Friendship
As a memorial of that friendship
what could be more appropriate than
a carillon? The Low Countries had
been a land of singing towers for
centuries. Through times of war and
peace the carillons inspired a demo
cratic spirit. For of all musical in
struments the carillon is the most
democratic.
An inscription in the Hoover Li
brary describes Stanford's bells:
"The Carillon of thirty-five bells
in this Tower was originally cast
by Marcel Michels in Tournai, Bel
gium, for the Belgian Pavilion at
The New York World's Fair, 1939
and 1910. The Carillon is a gift to
Stanford University from the Bel
gian American Educational Foun
dation, with which are associated
the Belgian universities and edu
cational foundation, recipients of
endowment funds from the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium
1914-1919. Dedicated on June 20.
1941."
Now though the bells of Belgium

have been melted into cannon, their
! spirit rings over America. Approxi-
J mately 50 carillons were installed
j here between the Wars. Of these
i there are two on the Pacific Coast;
i the electrically operated carillon of
! Grace Cathedral in San Francisco
and the carillon in the Hoover Tower
at Stanford.
Played by Lawson
The carillon is played every week
end by James R. Lawson who stud
ied in the tradition of Belgian caril
lonneurs. Exact time of the recitals
may be secured from the weekly
Stanford University Calendar. The
i recitals are best heard from a dis
tance of at least 500 feet, for the sec
| ondary tones will blur at a closer
| range. Listeners should select a
1 quiet location having an unobstruct
' ed view of the belfry.


HERBERT HOOVER, ex-Presi
dent of the United States, admin
istered relief to the people of Bel
gium during and after World War
I. The Stanford Carillon is a
memorial of the friendship which
Mr. Hoover built up between the
two countries.
