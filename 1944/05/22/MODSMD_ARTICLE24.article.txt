Navy Blues took over the campus
this weekend as five Waves, year
long veterans at their posts in San
Francisco, visited the Farm as the
guests of the University.
"We certainly like Stanford," Lau-
I lie Jenuwine said, "and it's like a
present from heaven to have spent
I this weekend here. The five of us
j are from all different parts of the
| countryâ€”New York, Los Angeles,
Nebraska, Portland, Me., and Mich
| igan, and only two of us had ever
j seen the campus before."
The Waves, Virginia Christiansen,
i Betty Kiloh, Doris Kenfrigan, Lu-
I cille Totch, and Miss Jenuwine, are
stationed at the Federal building and
at 105 Market street in San Fran
cisco. under the Naval Reserve Edu
cational Center.
The weekend was filled with tours
of the campus, including a Saturday
i picnic in the Peninsula hills, and the
I service in Memorial Chapel yester
day morning.
"Most of all. we'd like to thank the
j Stanford girls who have been our
| hostesses," Miss Jenuwine added.
Ada Bell Banta entertained two of
j the Waves at the Oaks; Mary Al
j drich, Connie Metcalfe, and Kay
! Simons were hostesses to two staying
j in Casa Olivo of Lagunita; and Miss
! Jenuwine was the guest of Martsa
i McCai n in Roble.
