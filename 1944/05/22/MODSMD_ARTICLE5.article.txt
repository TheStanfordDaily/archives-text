+ ALLIED HQ.. NAPLES (UP)—
| American troops in an eight-mile
j advance have captured Fondi, crack-
I ing the Germans' third defense line
i in Western Italy, and French forces
i have blocked the Pontecorvo-Pico
| road in parallel blows that split the
| enemy front into three crumbling
j segments, it was disclosed tonight.
Fondi fell late Saturday to an
American armored column which,
surprising and overrunning the Ger
man defenders, thus reached a point
| only 30 miles from the Anzio beach
; head and 50 miles from the heart of
I Rome.
A second American column swept
up the sandy Tyrrenhean coast to
within eight miles of burning Terra
cina, meeting only scattered i-esist
ance from German rear guards who
were being harried by long-range
artillery and clouds of planes. The
I entire German right wing became
j isolated by the fall of Fondi and was
believed falling back beyond Terra -
cina into the Pontine marshes, which
have again been partly flooded by
I the enemy.
