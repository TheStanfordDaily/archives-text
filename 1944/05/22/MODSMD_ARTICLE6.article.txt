The Sponsor-Choosing Committee is holding interviews for all girls in
terested in being sponsors for either summer and fall or fall and winter
quarters. These interviews will takt place next Thursday morning, 9 to 12,
and Friday afternoon, 1 to 4, in the Excom room of the Old Union, accord
ing to Marian Nielsen, chairman.
To be eligible for the position of sponsor a girl must have Upper Division

i standing. However, the committee
urges that any lower division girls
interested come for interviews, so
the committee may meet them and
; keep them in mind. This system of
interviews has been made necessary

more fairly when it has met all those
interested," she commented.
The committee will choose the
sponsors soon after the interviews,
their decision being subject to the
approval of the Dean of Women's
Office.
