# Excom Approves New Club Plans
## 
### 
International Club officers met on
Thursday with members of Excom in
the A.S.S.U. office to discuss club
policies and activities.
The International Club has
planned, with the approval of Excom,
the following program. The club will
write letters to foreign students be
fore they arrive at Stanford and will
meet them when they arrive in Palo
Alto.
The club will sponsor a pre-reg
and post-reg procedure. An office of
orientation for new foreign students
will be set up on Reg Day and will
continue to function throughout the
quarter for the use of the newcomers.
This office will attempt to do some
thing to counteract the tendency of
foreign students to live off-campus.
A definite bureau to explain to
foreign students campus events is
another of the plans of the Interna
tional Club to encourage members
and non-members to become friends.
