"ONE of the Farm's most useful traditions, that of Labor Day, had
its origin in the first year of the Convalescent Home's establish
ment. And it all happened through an error on the part of some
one in failing to instruct the workingmen to empty the basement
the day before the home was to open."
On an early Sunday morning in 1920 A 1 Roth, University
Comptroller, went out to the grounds to see if everything was
ready for occupation the next day. All was in readiness with the
exception of a basement full of undesirable rubble. No laborers
being available that day, Mr. Roth drove up and down the Row
and finally recruited three Zetes and two Phi Delts to play the
part of menials.
"This was the first instance of Stanford's progression 'to the
left' in favor of Labor," the author wrote.
"The success of these five pioneer laborers was so great that
another Labor Day was held the same year, with Mr. and Mrs.
Timothy Hopkins as guests at the barbecue. Sam Mac Donald,
veteran barbecue man, reigned over the first as well as the last
fiery kingdom of roast sheep."
One of the earliest raditions, the election of a gueen for the
Masque Ball at a cent a vote, was ruled out a few years after it
started. However, students replaced it with the Sophomore Car-!
nival and informal dancing. The after "work day" barbecue has.
not become a war casualty despite rationing.
With these few facts it is understandable that so many stu-\
dents—those who know the Farm—are at the Con Home on the
annual Labor Day. The work was postponed last Wednesday
because of bad weather. But everybody goes today. —Dave Davis
