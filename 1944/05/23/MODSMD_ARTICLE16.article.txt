LOOKS LIKE the fighter pilots stationed in England had a field
day on the continent Sunday. And this is the correct usage ofjhe
word "on" as they were pretty close to the Continent, as close as
they'll ever get until "Anxious Day" comes along.
It seems as though the various C.O.'s of the various fighter
bases throughout England yielded to their pilot's boyish desires
|nd told them to cut loose and strafe practically everything in
sight. You can well imagine with what joy they received the
announcement. Once in a while somebody gets a childish desire
such as that and decides to vibrate the terra cotta on Stanford's
roofs.
An A.P. report from London says 3,000 of the planes, mostly
fighters, veritably converted the whole of Western Europe into
a shooting gallery.
The planes swept across Germany, France and the Low Coun
tries. Some bombs were dropped, says A.P. curtly.
This is the first time in quite a while that bombs haven't fea
tured in daily raids over the continent.
Some bombs, however, were dropped and a medium-sized
torce of heavy bombers took part in the raid. But, machine guns
and cannon were the principal weapons.
Evidently, this new mass fighter and strafing technique (new
tactically speaking) is not conducive to low incidence of losses j
amongst the air squadrons. Fifty-seven British and American
planes failed to return.
This is one of the largest numbers yet lost in any one par-1
ticular raid. It's a sure bet that the commanders will think twice ;
before putting the planes on such a mass low level strafing raid
again. This is all that can be said for it for the present. We have
yet to know the reaction it produces, the total effect and the all
in all damage on the enemy.
We do know this. Three hundred locomotives were hit in the
mass strafing attack.
