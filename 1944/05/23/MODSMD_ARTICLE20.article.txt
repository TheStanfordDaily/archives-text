"Science at Work," a script writ
ten by Norman Krammer, a fresh
man living in Buchanan Hall, was
broadcast by Palo Alto High School
students yesterday over KQVV.
This was the first of five daily
broadcasts by the school to be given
this week. The program dealt with
the acceptance of aviation as a sci
ence, and was a half-hour long.
