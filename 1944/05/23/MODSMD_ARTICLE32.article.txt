# Powell Pic Rated Poor
## 
### 
Now showing 1 at the Stanford The- ,
ater, "The Heavenly Body," with ;
! William Powell. Hedy Lamarr, and ;
James Craig; also "Swing Fever," J
with Kay Kyser.
M-G-M's latest attempt at pro-
I ducing a witty comedy has fizzled
; out. "Heavenly Body" is the story of
an astronomer who spends his nights
up at the observatory observing a
comet he just discovered. Thus pushes
I his wife, so she gets impatient (who i
; wouldn't?) and consults an astrologer
i who casts a horoscope which predicts
| all sorts of dire happenings to block
j their marital happiness.
Sure enough, everything takes
I place just as the horoscope said it
would, much to the dismay of the
I poor astronomer who has to sit and
! take what his wife dishes out—name
| ly, a rival, a prospective divorce, etc.
You know the rest. It's the same
; old triangle in disguise, and all
I turns out happily in the end (as
; usual). William Powell, as the
i astronomer, tries his darnedest to
| resurrect a poor plot that should
I have been allowed to rest in peace
; long ago, and turns in his usual good
i performance. Hedy Lamarr, as the
wife, and James Craig, as the rival,
j don't help things very much.
The picture enjoys a few funny
scenes at the end, thanks to our old
friend Bill P., but they don't save it.
There is also supposed to be some
j sort of analogy between Hedy La
j marr and the heavenly body that Mr.
j Powell discovers, but we think the
! comet was far more interesting. It
jis our candid opinion that Hedy
| should have retired long ago to pose
j for stills; she doesn't have to try to
; act for them.
i "Swing Fever," is more Class B
j stuff, and a typical second feature.
I Kay Kyser is good only when he has
i his back to the camera and is leading
| h siband. There are songs, but they
| are not much.
The two interesting parts appear
| when Harry James and Tommy Dor
j sey pop up out of the depths' of the
; orchestra and wive with an all-too
short session on their instruments;
and Lena Home sings a mediocre
j song in one scene which is saved by j
Lena's breath-taking style and by i
some excellent photography that sets 1
the mood perfectly for her number.

Now showing 1 at the Stanford The- ,
ater, "The Heavenly Body," with ;
! William Powell. Hedy Lamarr, and ;
James Craig; also "Swing Fever," J
with Kay Kyser.
M-G-M's latest attempt at pro-
I ducing a witty comedy has fizzled
; out. "Heavenly Body" is the story of
an astronomer who spends his nights
up at the observatory observing a
comet he just discovered. Thus pushes
I his wife, so she gets impatient (who i
; wouldn't?) and consults an astrologer
i who casts a horoscope which predicts
| all sorts of dire happenings to block
j their marital happiness.
Sure enough, everything takes
I place just as the horoscope said it
would, much to the dismay of the
I poor astronomer who has to sit and
! take what his wife dishes out—name
| ly, a rival, a prospective divorce, etc.
You know the rest. It's the same
; old triangle in disguise, and all
I turns out happily in the end (as
; usual). William Powell, as the
i astronomer, tries his darnedest to
| resurrect a poor plot that should
I have been allowed to rest in peace
; long ago, and turns in his usual good
i performance. Hedy Lamarr, as the
wife, and James Craig, as the rival,
j don't help things very much.
The picture enjoys a few funny
scenes at the end, thanks to our old
friend Bill P., but they don't save it.
There is also supposed to be some
j sort of analogy between Hedy La
j marr and the heavenly body that Mr.
j Powell discovers, but we think the
! comet was far more interesting. It
jis our candid opinion that Hedy
| should have retired long ago to pose
j for stills; she doesn't have to try to
; act for them.
