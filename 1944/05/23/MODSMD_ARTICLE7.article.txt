# Roble Head Made Civilian Recruiter
## 
### 
Considering the number of Roble
sponsors who have gone into the
WAVES en masse, perhaps, WAVE
Lieut. Irene Williamson, guest at
Union Residence last Thursday eve
ning, swore in as civilian recruiter
Miss Rosamond Clark, director of
Roble.
Lieutenant Williamson spoke to
seniors and women interested in the
WAVES after dinner at Union Resi
dence. Miss Clark w;is sworn in as
civilian recruiter before the guests
and now has an official card and copy
of her oath with which to confront
unwary prospects.
