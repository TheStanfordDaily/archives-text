# Yanks, British, Open Big Italian General Offensive Backed by 5th, 8th Armies
## 
### 
ALLIED HQ., NAPLES (UP) â€”Supported by battleships, planes, and
1.000 big guns, American and British troops from the Anzio beachhead
launched a general offensive today, synchronizing with the main Fifth and
Eighth armies in an all-out drive which caught 17 German divisions in p.
giant nutcracker and opened the final battle for Rome.

(American parachutists have de
scended in great force across the Ap
pian way between the two fronts, a
German broadcast said, and are en
gaged in fierce fighting with German
troops. A Swiss broadcast said that
American troops had driven from the
east flank of the beachhead to Lake
Fogliano, 19 miles from U.S. spear
heads northeast of Terracina, repre
senting a gain of about four miles.)
Allied artillery, probably more
than 3,000 field pieces, already was
raking German positions with a cross
fire from the southern and beachhead
fronts as doughboy veterans of Africa
and Sicily, rising from ravines and
blood-red poppy fields at 6:30 a.m.,
smashed toward Cisterna.
The direction of the British attack
was not specified but a strong British
force has been holding positions on
the opposite fiang of the beachhead
only 21 miles from Rome.
Simultaneously, American tanks
opened a frontal assault on Terracina,
coastal anchor of the Germans'
southern front 23 miles from the
beachhead, and the British Eighth
Army struck in a powerful renewal
of its offensive against the Hitler line
just south of Monte Cairo.
