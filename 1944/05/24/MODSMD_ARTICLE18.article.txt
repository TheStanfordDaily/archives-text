"THROUGH the institution of a sound and
vigorous postwar program we hope to be
able to aid Stanford fraternities in the construc
tion of a strengthened and improved organiza
tion after the war," announces A 1 Cleveland,
president of Interfraternity Board at Stanford.
Appointing Wiley Hartman and Ray Alden to
a postwar planning committee, Interfraternity
Board indicates a perception of the need for a
realistic attitude by social organizations toward
the problems which will arise in postwar edu
cational re-adjustment.
This is a farsignted move and is to be en
dorsed.â€”Dave Davis
