# Views on Your War

The Japs have again cropped up with an idea
as to the final disposition of the Americans and
their facilities. First it was peace in the White
house, but the instigator of the idea —Admiral

Yamamoto—-was killed in a plane crash not so
long ago.
Now the Jap periodical Meiho has an idea that
should be quite sobering for us. Should it come
true —-the occidental way of life will be wiped
out.
The report from the Japanese came via Berlin
and says the price for peace in the Pacific is
the transfer of the entire United States Navy
and all large merchant ships to Japan.
The terms were all given in a broadcast from
Berlin and were drawn up by what the Japanese
called experts in various fields and provide that
the United States should be kept under strict
surveillance for 10 years after the war.
Here are some of the other conditions as
quoted by Berlin:
"The entire Naval Air Force to be put at the
disposal of the Japanese.
"All naval air bases and air installations to
be destroyed, except those needed by Japan.
"Steel and oil production to be permitted on
a reduced scale only.
"All expenses of taking over American ships
by Japan to be paid by the United States.
"All naval installations, naval stations, dock
yards, arsenals, colleges, and other centers of
naval educations to be destroyed.
"In the case of a scuttling of a single ship,
10 times the amount will be paid by the United
States to the Japanese government."
Evidently our Navy is getting the honorable
Nipponese goat, but the unfortunate part of the
whole thing is that they believe in their way of
life and our destruction just as fervently as we
wish to preserve what we know as the Ameri
can way of living. They are desperate and a
cornered animal always fights back.
Here are some of the economic terms as
drawn up by "Financial Expert" Yasei Nishiya:
"Private banking to be eliminated,' monopo
lies, trusts, cartels, and capitalist methods in
agriculture to be liquidated.
"Stock exchanges to be abrogated.
"All trade unions to be abolished."
This is the first time in many months of United
Nations' successes and fighting in the Far East
that Japan has really gotten mad. Apparently
what we have been doing lately to the Nips has
struck a solid blow at the home front because
this article reflects a sort of llth-hour threat
and desperate move to counteract the United
States. Another thing—all this was released via
Radio Berlin. What is the method behind it?
Are they afraid to quote it directly? Do they
wish to have a ready out, an excuse by saying
Berlin misquoted them when the day of reckon
ing comes. We don't know—but it's that pe
culiar Jap logic.
