## 
### JOHN FIGG-HOBLYN 
The Med School continued their
winning ways on Monday afternoon
by taking the hot and cold Monroe
Boozers to the tune of 7 to 1. Sher,
Monroe's ace pitcher pitched an ex
cellent game for the Boozers, but the
game was lost through the errors of
outfielders who allowed two un
polled home runs out of the three
that the Meds scored.
Tyler Hall defeated the boys from
Lincoln by the score of 10 runs to 5.
The main scoring occurred in the
third inning when Hjelte of Tyler hit
a home run. scoring three runs.
Lincoln Hall didn't have too much
of a chance as they had only seven
men on the field.
Pitts Stars
The feature game of the evening
was that between Hayes Hall and the
Firehouse. It was another no-hitter
for Pitts, the Firemen's pitcher. Mor
rison for Hayes did not do so badly,
allowing only four hits. The final
score was 3 to 0 in favor of the Fire
house.
All the Fireboys' hits were singles,
and they scored one run in the third
inning on an error and two runs in
I he fourth on four more errors, all in
the infield. The rest of the game was
scoreless.
Garfield Win
The game between Garfield and the
hapless Legal Eagles turned out to
be a slugging match and finally end
ed up with Garfield winning by the
lop-sided score of 16 to 7. The game
featured numerous home runs, four
in number, all made by the Garfield
ians.
Two of the homers occurred with
the bags loaded, accounting for the
high score. Rosburg, pitching for
allowed few hits, most of
Lawyers' runs being scored on
errors.
McKinley Scores
The game involving the lowly Bu
chanan Bearcats and the up and
coming McKinley Bashers was a
grudge fight and turned out to be a
wild affair indeed with the Bashers
winning easily, 17 to 3. The game
was one of errors, about 90 per cent
of which were Buchanan's. The last
two innings became quite wild when
the infield play of McKinley was dis
rupted by Bearcats who. knowing the
game was lost, thought they might
have a little fun.
Several times Bearcats raced onto
the field to ruin potential McKinley
putouts by interfering with the
throws to first base.
