# Hagopian Stories Rated Fascinating, Vivid, Real

### RENA JEAN BLACK 
The aim of any best selling novelist
is to write what he has to say in a
new and different manner. Stereo-

types in literature,
1 both in plot and
style, are so fre
quently pushed off
on the reading
public that it often
i becomes quite a
surprise to find
that someone has
written something
really different
and alive. "The

Dove Brings Peace," by Richard
Hagopian, is such a book; different,
fascinating, and vividly real.
Short Stories
"The Dove Brings Peace" is a col
lection of short stories about Arme
nians, emigres from the old country,
in America. The stories are not
written in the manner in which the
new country, judged the Armenians,
but rather from the viewpoint of the
emigrants, to whom the new way of
life was strange, and often very sad.
Perhaps the completely convincing
touch is caught by Mr. Hagopian in
his portrayal of a people, transplant
ed from the ideas and beliefs of their
•heritage into a new, rough, and
sometimes hostile America, by the
fact that the characters who people
his book are real persons. The short

stories are about Mr. Hagopian's
father and mother, his relatives, and
the old country Armenians among
whom he grew up.
Not Depressing
Many of the stories are sad, and
yet they are saved from being de
pressing by the humor which Mr.
Hagopian has woven into the phi
losophies, the actions, and the words
of his characters. Humor seems to be
one of Mr. Hagopian's best attributes,
as any student of the Menlo .Junior
College will testify, for Mr. Hagopian
is a member of the Menlo J.C. teach
ing staff. "Dick's" theories on edu
cation are as revolutionary as is the
style of his short stories, for boys
from the J.C. fill his English classes
to the last seat, and brag that in a
few years, "Dick" will be the fore
most short, story author in the coun
try.
"The Dove Brings Peace" certainly
has the local approval, but as proof
of its desirability, it has made a name
for itself by being placed on the
Book of the Month Club's list for the
month's best stories.

The aim of any best selling novelist
is to write what he has to say in a
new and different manner. Stereo-

types in literature,
1 both in plot and
style, are so fre
quently pushed off
on the reading
public that it often
i becomes quite a
surprise to find
that someone has
written something
really different
and alive. "The

Dove Brings Peace," by Richard
Hagopian, is such a book; different,
fascinating, and vividly real.
Short Stories
"The Dove Brings Peace" is a col
lection of short stories about Arme
nians, emigres from the old country,
in America. The stories are not
written in the manner in which the
new country, judged the Armenians,
but rather from the viewpoint of the
emigrants, to whom the new way of
life was strange, and often very sad.
Perhaps the completely convincing
touch is caught by Mr. Hagopian in
his portrayal of a people, transplant
ed from the ideas and beliefs of their
•heritage into a new, rough, and
sometimes hostile America, by the
fact that the characters who people
his book are real persons. The short

stories are about Mr. Hagopian's
father and mother, his relatives, and
the old country Armenians among
whom he grew up.
Not Depressing
Many of the stories are sad, and
yet they are saved from being de
pressing by the humor which Mr.
Hagopian has woven into the phi
losophies, the actions, and the words
of his characters. Humor seems to be
one of Mr. Hagopian's best attributes,
as any student of the Menlo .Junior
College will testify, for Mr. Hagopian
is a member of the Menlo J.C. teach
ing staff. "Dick's" theories on edu
cation are as revolutionary as is the
style of his short stories, for boys
from the J.C. fill his English classes
to the last seat, and brag that in a
few years, "Dick" will be the fore
most short, story author in the coun
try.
"The Dove Brings Peace" certainly
has the local approval, but as proof
of its desirability, it has made a name
for itself by being placed on the
Book of the Month Club's list for the
month's best stories.
