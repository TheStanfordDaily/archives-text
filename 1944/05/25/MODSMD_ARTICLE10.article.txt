To the Editor:
Aside from the fact that the news—a recording of "Gertie from
Bizerte" exists—is interesting, I don't see why Marty Klein wastes
his time and talent, and the Daily's space and linotype machines
to write about records and bands which will be forgotten in six
months.
Beyond that, the reviewer is evidently unable to establish the
relationship between the music he mentions and the society
from which it springs, which should be the aim of the true critical
analyst. Instead he talks about the "blend of violins," the poor
phrasing in the saxophones, and that a record bogs under with
too much rhythm.
He calls Miller recordings so important that a special column
will be devoted to them "because none can be passed over
lightly." I doubt that this letter will deter Mr. Klein from his plan,
but I hope he will consider Miller in the light of really important
contemporaries as Mugsy Spanier, Eddie Condon, and the rest
of the righteous boys. I am no fanatic worshipper of the cult
of "real jazz" but some men are important as far as folk music is
concerned and Miller, James, Spivak are not.
Respectfully,
L.D.
