# Farm Gets 'New Deal' Socially

Stepping forward in an effort to
create a workable and sane social
policy for Stanford University stu
dents, Excom last night outlined and
made legal a regulation regarding
all off-campus activities. The law,
"A date for any off-campus function
sponsored by a group or an indi
vidual must be applied for to Ex
committee two weeks prior to the
occasion."
This states in effect that any off
campus activity sponsored by an in
dividual or a group is illegal unless
okayed by Excom, and that such
illegality will be dealt with through
the regular enforcement channels.
The new social regulation, which
erases the former law forbidding
any off - campus group function
whatsoever, was formulated two
weeks ago by Excom. No publica
tion was made of the law pending an
examination of its various ramifica
tions.
Recent social problems which have
developed on campus necessitated a
thorough and open examination of
the new ruling and this examination
resulted in an official rephrasing of
the original motion. The original
motion, as passed by Excom two
weeks ago, made no reference to
individual sponsorship of off-campus
activity.
By press time Excom had also
tabled a request by campus and fac
ulty supporters for the A.S.S.U. okay
of a charter-constitution establishing
a Stanford chapter of the American
Youth for Democracy. Further clari
fication of the relationship to the na
tional organization was requested by
several Excom members.
