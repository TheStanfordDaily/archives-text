# 'Mothers-in-Law' Topic of 'Y' Group
## 
### 
Mrs. Samuel Brooks Morris, in her
talk to members of the "Y" Home
ancl Marriage Group, said yesterday
that the relationship between daugh
ters and mothers-in-law should be
based fundamentally upon the same
principles that guide the natural
friendships of women of different
generations.
Since the young wife has chosen
her husband largely on the basis of
attitudes in common, it is natural
that the mother of this man would
! share with him some of his interests,
; would possess some of his traits.
The areas of stress and strain may
! lie to a'great extent in trying to dis-
I cuss the husband or son, since the

| two women are likely to be conflict
| ing in their experiences with him and
I expectations of him.
