## Top Pitchers Battle Tonight 
### ROGER GORMAN 
Bringing together two of the |
league's top three pitchers (the other |
being Luke Pitts of the Firehouse), 1
tonight's top mural softball game i
matches Monroe against Hayes Hall.
Smoke Morrison will handle the [
mound chores for Hayes, while Joe |
®Khcr will be up on the hill for Mon- !
This is the first of two battles |
this week for these men, for Sher will j
pitch for the Daily and Morrison for [
the Chappie in tomorrows Daily vs.
Chappie slugfest. On the basis of ,
their smooth-working infield, Hayes I
rates a slight edge in what should be |
one of the tightest games of the year. |
The league-leading Med School
comes up against the in-and-out
Tyler Hall gang in a tilt that should
not give the Medics much trouble.
We'll take the Med men by a com
fortable margin.
The other top contender, the Fire
house, should have a field day while
swamping the hapless Legal Eagles.
Up against the Lincoln outfit that
showed flashes of form at the begin
ning of the season and fizzled out
when the heat was on, Gerona A.C.
should extend their winning streak
without any undue «efTort.
In the only other game slated for
today, Garfield will slaughter the |
cellar-dwelling Buchanan ten.
The complete schedule is:
Garfield vs. Buchanan.
Firehouse vs. Legal Eagles.
JVlcKinley vs. Bye.
