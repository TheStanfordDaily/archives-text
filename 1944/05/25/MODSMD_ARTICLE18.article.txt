# Daily and Chappie Diamonders Prep For Tomorrow's Grudge Battle
## 
### 
With threats and warnings issuing from both sides, fin;rl preparations '
are being completed for the annual Daily vs. Chappie Softball fracas to j
be held on the Sunken Diamond at 4 p.m. tomorrow.
Latest word from the Daily camp has it that First Baseman Ed Luce will
be unable to compete. Daily moguls are searching frantically to find a

replacement for the slugging first- <
saeker who leaves tomorrow morn
ing for Los Angeles to jump in the
Coliseum Invitational Track Meet.
Discounting most of the propa
ganda put forth by both squads, the
tussle shapes up as a pitchers' battle,
with Joe Sher hurling for the Daily
and Smoke Morrison on the mound
for the Chappie.
Charges by Barney (Slugger) Gu
gel that they are using a bunch of
ringers to bolster their team were ;

laughed at by Daily bosses, who
J pointed out that every one of their J
! players is a bona-fide member of I
their staff with at least one story to j
his credit.
That grand old woman of the edit
stall', Henrietta Nussbaum, empha
sized this by stating, "No other or- |
ganization can make this claim."
