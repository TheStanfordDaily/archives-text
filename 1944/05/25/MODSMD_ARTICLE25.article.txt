# Civil Engineers See Sunnyvale
## 
### 
Last Saturday the student chapter
of the American Society of Civil En
gineers and members of the faculty
went to Sunnyvale, according to their
president, John Jenks. The trip was
highlighted by a visit of the Joshua
Hendy Iron Works.
The day, which was arranged by
"Pop" Reynolds, faculty advisor to
the organization, included inspec
tion of the production of the large
2,500-h.p. reciprocating steam en
gines which power the Liberty ships
and steam turbines which take 24
days to make.
During the lunch hour the or
ganization had an opportunity to
hear the Hendy swing band, com
posed of employees, which plays dur
ing the Saturday lunch hour for the
other workers.
Captain Bany of the S.S. Joshua
Hendy (commissioned last year and
outfitted by the Hendy Plant) told of
his experiences all over the world in
the ship. Â»
He expressed his appreciation to
the workers of Hendy lor building an
engine which operated faultlessly
through 48.000 miles of travel. He
stressed the importance of each
worker's job in turning out the en
gines which power the ships that are
the lifelines of all our boys overseas.
The students, three girls included,
were taken through the great plant
by Colonel Allen, formerly here at
Stanford.
