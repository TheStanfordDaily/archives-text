SWEDEN still seems to be getting away with murder. And the
whole difficulty has arisen over Sweden's shipment of ball bear
ings to Germany to add to the now depleted Nazi stockpile. The
shortage of ball bearings in Germany is due to one thing —the
Britain-based United States Eighth Air Force. Time and again the
huge "Forts" and "Liberators" have unleashed tons of high ex
plosives on the German ball bearing production centers —most
notably Schweinfurt.
Now Sweden is helping to replace those ball bearings lost by
our action and negating the efforts of the men who man the big
bombers. This action by the Swedes means that they are throw
ing away the lives of many of our men at the fronts. Our State
Department realizes this and has started to take appropriate
action.
• An A.P. dispatch from Washington says the State Department
has made it known that a considerable number of Swedish firms
are being investigated for blacklisting and action will be taken
against them within the next few days.
The information came out in connection with a statement by
the department that no firm "has been or will be included in the
proclaimed list merely because means of pressure may exist by
reason of American connections."
The principal Swedish ball bearing manufacturer is the SKF
firm which has American affiliates in New York and Philadelphia.
The State Department also gave out a list of 11 Swedish com
panies and affiliates which it said was published in a press re
port, and said that none of these firms named "is at the present
time under consideration for inclusion in the list."
This means only one thing—the State Department publishes
a list of those not blackballed and you sit up nights wondering
and trying to figure out those who are—that is if it means enough
to you.
