# ITALIAN FRONT
## Junction of Allied Armies at Cisterna 
### 
ALLIED HQ.. NAPLES, May 23
(UP). â€”Allied armies from the An
zio beachhead and Terracina made
a historic junction today and im
mediately began a great combined
onslaught on Rome as the douglv
boys smashed into Cisterna. outpost
of the Germans' final defense line
before the Eternal City.
Initially linked by patrol spear
heads in the Pontine marshes near
the coast and along the Appian Way
six miles east of Cisterna, the two
powerful Allied forces consolidated
their union during the day into a
solid front extending more than 70
miles from Ponte Corvo to within
23 miles of the mouth of the Tiber.
The junction climaxed a lightning
Allied offensive which opened just
14 days ago and resulted in the
greatest victory for Lt. Gen. Mark
W. Clark's Fifth Army since it drove
ashore at Salerno last Sept. 8 and
began a march on Rome.
