### Barney Gugle 
Today, Friday, May 26, is an important day
in the history of Stanford. Two great events, the
Spring Show and the Chaparral-Daily baseball
game, take place.
The Spring Show, which will be a combina
tion minstrel show-opera-ballet-musical, really
looked good in the rehearsals and should take
the campus by storm.
Sharp gags like—
Rastus: Who was that close mouth friend I
saw you with last night?
Mr. Bones: That was no close mouthed friend,
he was just waiting for the janitor to bring the
spitoon back.
—will make the Spring Show one of the import
ant dramatic events in the Bay Area this year.
Practically the entire campus is expected to
show up at the Sunken Diamond at 4 this after
noon to witness the Chaparral trounce the Daily
Palo Altan, which is fondly called the Daily by
many students.
Looking at the game with an unbiased eye,
we will go out on a limb f.nd predict that the
Chappie will win by at least 10 runs. "Smoke"
Morrisson's pitching plus the smooth playing of
a few of the other boys should send the Daily
back to its worm eaten shack with its tail be
tween its legs.
