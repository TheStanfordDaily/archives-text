Britain's cigar-chomping Prime Minister to
day looked toward the Balkans as the probable
theater of victory. In an 85-minute speech be
fore the House of Commons, the dowdy Church
ill said the Allied powers will decide whether
Germany must undergo territorial changes and
Churchill advocated "a world council of great
states" to keep up enough arms to preserve
peace after the war and a world assembly of
all the powers."
His suggested "world organization," he said,
would embody much of the structure of the
League of Nations, but this time it must bristle
the Atlantic charter "in no way binds us about
the future of that country."
"We intend to set up a world order eguipped
with all necessary attributes of power in order
to prevent the breaking out of wars or long
planning of them by restless and ambitious
nations."
"We have great hopes that Rome may be
preserved," the Prime Minister added.
In his speech opening a foreign policy de
bate, Britain's number one man said the Allies
had "suspended" efforts to bring Turkey with
them but "it looks probable the Allies will be
able to win the war in the Balkans and through
out southeast Europe without Turkey being
involved in it at all, although of course the aid
}112 Turkey would be of great help and accelera
tion in that process."
Churchill also touched off a new high in
diplomatic bouquets. He spoke kindly of Spain,
criticizing those who insult and abuse the
Franco government. Spain's internal policies,
the Prime Minister declared, are a matter for

Spaniards alone. For a Fascist - hater like
Churchill, this is entirely a new method of
approach.
Proclaiming the British Empire and Common
wealth in complete unity to go on with the
Allies "to beat the enemy as soon as possible,
with "overwhelming military power."
Using the Yugoslav situation at one point to ;
illustrate the Allied policy, Churchill said:
"All guestions of monarchy, or republic, or '
leftism are strictly subordinated."
At another point he said: "In one place we
support a king, in another a Communist. There 1
is no particular attempt by us to enforce par
ticular ideologies. We only want to beat the
enemy and then, in happy and serene peace,
let the best expression be given to the will of
the people."

the future of that country."
"We intend to set up a world order eguipped
with all necessary attributes of power in order
to prevent the breaking out of wars or long
planning of them by restless and ambitious
nations."
"We have great hopes that Rome may be
preserved," the Prime Minister added.
In his speech opening a foreign policy de
bate, Britain's number one man said the Allies
had "suspended" efforts to bring Turkey with
them but "it looks probable the Allies will be
able to win the war in the Balkans and through
out southeast Europe without Turkey being
involved in it at all, although of course the aid
}112 Turkey would be of great help and accelera
tion in that process."
Churchill also touched off a new high in
diplomatic bouquets. He spoke kindly of Spain,
criticizing those who insult and abuse the
Franco government. Spain's internal policies,
the Prime Minister declared, are a matter for

Spaniards alone. For a Fascist - hater like
Churchill, this is entirely a new method of
approach.
Proclaiming the British Empire and Common
wealth in complete unity to go on with the
Allies "to beat the enemy as soon as possible,
with "overwhelming military power."
Using the Yugoslav situation at one point to ;
illustrate the Allied policy, Churchill said:
"All guestions of monarchy, or republic, or '
leftism are strictly subordinated."
At another point he said: "In one place we
support a king, in another a Communist. There 1
is no particular attempt by us to enforce par
ticular ideologies. We only want to beat the
enemy and then, in happy and serene peace,
let the best expression be given to the will of
the people."
