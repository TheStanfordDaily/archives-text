# New Gun-Play Misses Mark

### 
Now playing at the Stanford The
ater: BUFFALO BILL, starring Joel
MeCrea, Maureen O'Hara.
Twentieth-Century-Fox has added
a few Indians, a human interest
story, and excellent color photog
raphy to the same old plot, and has
ended up, lor all its effort, with pre
cisely the same cowboy and Indian
routine it was pulling on us y'ars and
y'ars ago.
In fairness to a noble attempt, we
will personally pin a rose on the pho
tographer who took some of the most
effective technicolor shots we've
seen yet.
Joel MeCrea turned in his usual

j uninspiring performance; Maureen
' O'Hara's beauty easily eclipsed her
[ acting ability. With tongue in cheek
j we will say it's a better-than-average
I western; but then, who likes west
j erns?
In Paramount's "You Can't Ration
| Love." Johnny Johnson plays the role
j of a schoolboy Frank Sinatra, up-
I setting the equilibrium of the man
j hungry females who have felt the fall
of the ratio. It's cute, Betty Rhodes
|is cute, and—words fail us —the
! music is cute. But someday, praise
■ Allah, there'll come a college picture
that will really cope with the subject.
