The Inter-University Religious Conference was held in the Memorial
1 Church from 1 to 4:45 last Sunday. There were 44 representatives in all,
and the colleges who had delegates included California, San Jose Stale, and
! Stanford.
The conclusions of the conference which have been presented to the

various religious administrative bod-*
ies of the universities are as follows: 1
The Work to He Done
It is necessary to discover and under- !
stand the basic Christian Doctrine;
a more thorough study of the Bible !
is essential; it is imperative to make j
as many personal contacts, and to
exert as much personal influence on j
behalf of Christianity as is possible.
We must ascertain what is holding
up religious advance on the cam
puses, and what is fostering it; an
I effort should be made to meet the '
; needs of living groups where devo
j tional services are desired; a room or ;
house, in which social activities of '
Christian groups may be carried on
is recommended.
Conferences Commended
It is advisable to have religious i
conferences or/and religious dis- i
cussions
All required college classes which
deal with religious topics should be
unbiased.
If such classes are biased, supple
mentary courses should be required
which present the opposite points of
view. It is the sense of the confer
| ence to seek to know God's will in a j
1 spirit of reverence and humility.
