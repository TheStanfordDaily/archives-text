# Reporter Nussbaum Reveals Secret of Dress Rehearsal
## 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM (As told to RENA JEAN BLACK 
Spring brings sunshine, flowers, and ivy to Roble, but spring also brings
sunburn, poison oak, and pollywogs to Lake Lagunita.
As to the category of the season in which the Spring Show is to be
classed, the Daily refuses to be quoted, but if those hilarious yells which
may be heard any hour of the day and night issuing from the tottering

walls of the Memorial Auditorium"
can be taken as proof that Spring
Show is a riot—you had better buy
your tickets in a hurry.
Insidious Propaganda
According to the show's propa
ganda minister, the dress rehearsal
last night was sensational. For the
first time since rehearsals began, the
least arrived on time; the directors
fainted. When they awoke they
found the usual bridge game in
progress on stage, with the more tal
ented members of the band holding
a jam session in the orchestra pit.
"On stage for the opener," yelled
Director Tillson from the depths of
her stage crew overalls.
16 Girly-Girlies
The 16 beautiful girls who greet,
the audience the minute the curtain
is pulled on the opener appealed so
to the stage hands that the official
curtain puller pulled the curtain five
times at the beginning. But, as it
turned out later, the 16 beautiful girls
had nothing on Jean Levinson, who
looked like Betty Grable, in her
hasher's outfit for Madame Cellarfly.
The lighting technician for the
show had a terrific sense of humor.
He hid in a little hole in the orchestra
pit and knocked himself out every
time he pulled all the light switches,
leaving the theater black. Every
time the lights went on again, the
boys who sing the Whiflenpoof song,
in true Med School style, were found
in the back of the auditorium with
members of the '"Ida" chorus sitting
on their laps.
Gillespie Gets 'em.
Dippy Gillespie was voted, by an
all-cast poll, the girl most likely to
bring down the house. Her Sub-deb
Blues are out of this world, according
to several drooling members of the
orchestra. Speaking of the orchestra,
the boys in that jivey band came in
for a lot of praise last night, for their
playing had the beat that sets the
listeners swaying.
Students who are struggling in the I
throes of Biology 2A simply can't |
stfford to miss Spring Show. The
biology skit is calculated to appeal to
their opinions of biology, general or
otherwise.
As for the Cellar opera—well, I
you'll just have to see it to appreciate
it. The dress rehearsal was sensa
tional, but the performance will be
even better. See you tonight at
Spring Show.
