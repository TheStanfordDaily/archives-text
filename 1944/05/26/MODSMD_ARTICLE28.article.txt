# Drama Library Lists Material
## 
### 
Unbeknown to the majority of
Stanford students is the fact that
they have at their disposal a drama
library which consists of over 7,000
volumes.
It contains not only scripts from
original plays, musicals, with their
accompanying scores, but also all
kinds of books on productions. All
available material written on the
subjects of directing, the art of
make-up, costuming, lighting, and
the construction of sets, has been
included in this amazing collection.
Clark Collection
Recently, the Barrett H. Clark col
lection, which includes over 1.000
rare items, was purchased. Mr. Clark
was head of the Dramatist Play
Service in New York, and was the
outstanding authority on the history
of the American theater.
In addition to this many Holly
wood producers have contributed
movie scripts that have been adapted
from American plays. Since both
the original plays and the movie
scripts are contained in the library,
students have the opportunity to
compare motion picture and legiti
mate stage productions, and the dif
ference techniques used in each.
Ram's Head Contributes
This library was originally started
by a fund set up by the Dramatic
Council and Ram's Head Dramatic-
Society. Two years ago it first con?
ceived the idea of starting such a
library, and began contributing the
profits from its shows to this cause.
When various alumni saw what an
interest the students were taking in
this project, they too began to con
tributeâ€”both money, books, plays,
and scripts.
Professor Hubert Heffner, head of
the Speech and Drama department,
says (his collection is probably the
best library of American drama west
of the Mississippi, and that it really
makes it possible for students to do
outstanding work here at Stanford.
