The Spring Show has not always
been a Ram's Head production, just
as the Gaieties has not always been
known as the Gaieties. To follow this
ambiguous statement one must trace
the history of student drama soci
eties at Stanford.
Originally there were four hono
rary drama groups, the Sword and
Sandal, Ram's Head (the oldest),
Barnstormers and the Masquers.
Ram's Head, which was for men ex
clusively, always produced the Big
Game Gaieties, called Football Frol
ics back in '09.
Sword and Sandal
Sword and Sandal, which was also
for men, stuck to higher type "se
rious drama." So did the (bird
group, the Masquers, which was an
organization for women. One-acts,
dramatic readings from Ibsen, O'Neil
and Shaw constituted their reper
toire.
Also in these early days each class
produced its own playsâ€”the Senior
Farce, Junior Opera, Sophomore
Comedy and Frosh Frolic. These
ambitious attempts were shortlived,
however, for first the frosh, then the
sophomores gave it up when their
productions had flopped due to their
inexperience.
Farce Forsaken
the seniors gave their Farce up
because it came right, before gradu
ation and they didn't have time.
The Junior Opera went on doggedly
until it was taken over by the Mas
quers and Sword and Sandal to be
their one frivolous production of the
year. Henceforth the Junior Opera
was known as the Spring Show.
Long after the class productions
were given up the four dramatic
societies merged. In 1936-37, after
Memorial Theater had been con
structed, it was found that there
was so much overlapping of members
and equipment that it was necessary
to organize the groups into one dra
matic club which was named the
Stagers.
This later became known as the
Ram's Head after the oldest of the
former societies. As Ram's Head this
honorary club is still very active.
They put on each year the Gaieties,
Spring Show, one-acts and dramatic
readings.
