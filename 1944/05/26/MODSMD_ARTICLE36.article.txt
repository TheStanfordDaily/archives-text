# Stanford Professor Emeritus Lee Emerson Bassett Recalls Lifetime in Farm Dramatics
## 
### GLORIA BROOKS 
Lee Emerson Bassett, professor
emeritus of the speech and drama
department, who recently portrayed
Blayds in the Stanford Players' pro
duction of "The Truth About
Blayds," has been one of the out
standing figures in the history of dra
matics at Stanford.
Mr. Bassett has spent 37 years
working in the speech and drama
department, and acting in and pro
ducing student plays.
Shows in Assembly Hall
He remembers how for many years
all dramatic activities were carried
on in the old Assembly Hall, now re
modeled into part of the Graduate
School of Business. It was on a
poorly built stage, with little space
for the construction and storage of
sets, and lack of dressing room ac
commodations, that early Spring
Shows were produced. Mr. Bassett
spoke of the inadequate seating fa
cilities and remarked that • no one
could see back of t.he front iow. In
spite of the inconveniences there
were many successful plays produced
there until 1937.
One of his favorite stories about
dramatic productions is how in giv
ing the Elizabethan play, "Knight of
•he Burning Pestle" in 1903 permis
sion was secured from Mrs. Stanford

to build a new stage about the regu
lar one to resemble the Globe stages
of Shakespeare's time.
New Theater
Finally in 1934 due to the increase
in enrollment in the speech and
drama department and general in
terest in improving the dramatic fa
cilities, Mr. Howard Hnlvenston is
sued a complaint to the University.
The interest of the student body was
aroused and Exeom began to discuss
plans for a new theater.
Mr. Bassett told how the initial
cost of the Memorial Theater, as it
was to be called, was covered by a
memorial fund in honor of Stanford
men who died in the last war. The
lund was intended for a monumental
building with trophy and executive
rooms. A committee of 50 under the
chairmanship of Dr. Durand, who is
now in government work in Wash
ington, was set up to consider the
matter.
Students Vote Yes
It was after Sword and Sandal, a
famous honorary dramatic club for
men, revived the idea for a theater
instead of the monument that the
situation was placed before the stu
dent body in 1934 for their sugges
tions. They responded by voting for
a new theater, offering to share in its
cost.
The site for the new theater was
decided upon and plans for it were
drawn up by Bakewell and Brown,
two of the most outstanding archi
tests in the United States.
Chappie Contributes
In addition to the memorial fund,

I a $2 increase in registration fees, the
I profits of the Stanford Union and
| student contributions swelled the
j funds for the impressive new build
ing. Mention must be made of the
large sum of $350,000 which was con
tributed by Hammer and Coffin, the
| national college humor society. Each
; member of Chapparal gave $5.
The cornerstone of the Memorial
j Theater was laid on May 28, 1936, and
! the impressive modern building was
! begun.
It contains a large auditorium, a
| memorial court and a little theater,
expensive lighting and other techni
cal equipment and spacious costum
j ing and dressing rooms. There are
also classrooms for the speech and
drama department which was recog
nized as a separate department fol
lowing Bassett's retirement in 1938.
When the speech and drama de
partment moved to the theater, it
contained 12 full-time teachers,
showing that the interest of dra
; matics promoted by Mr. Basset t had
led not only to a fine new theater of
which we may be proud but to a
growing interest in student dra
matics.
