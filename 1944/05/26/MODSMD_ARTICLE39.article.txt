# Barnstormers 'Hit the Road'
## 
### 
The Barnstormers which was one
of the four original honorary dra
matic societies at Stanford had many
amusing and disastrous experiences
in its career as a traveling stock com
pany. It took shows on (he road 01
its own expense and responsibility,
for it was not A.S.S.U. sponsored.
One time when the players wen
putting on a show at Tahoe the whole
tent in which they were staging theii
performance collapsed on them anc
the audience. Another time the lights
went off during the performance and
the audience had to park their can
in a semi-circle with the lights on,
so that the play could go on.
Then there were the many times
the unsuspecting audience missed
part of the play. Reason: their orang<
box seats couldn't hold up under the
strain.
