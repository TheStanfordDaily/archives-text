### ROGER WILCO 
We had a chance to see the dress
up on Spring Show last night and
came away wishing it were sched
uled for a year's run. It's fast and
hilarious, displaying the campus
charm at its best. Don't miss this
Gillespie gal, she'll make you moan
and groan with her tantalizing vocal.
Beg, borrow, promote or steal.
Back to GI chatter now.
Cleverest bit of chicanery turned
up in months is the little johhic
Hcrschel Oscar Knight used to pull
at a post where A's to M's got out
on pass one night while N's to Z's
got the passes the next night. He
was 11. O. K. one night and 11. O'K.
the next.
Try to match this for two-line
ooems:
WAH

Flirting with death dept.:
Benjo Whitepass saying of Vic
Lindskog, his boxing instructor, "I'll
moider da bum." Or trying to get
through the revolving door into the
mess hall when the boys are playing
run rabbit run, also known as last
one in gets caught in the mangle.
Pink Tanner attempting to fly from
the third floor of Encina.
Taking the stroll from History
Corner to the Ed. Aud. when these
women cyclists arc in a hurry.
Humor off the bull-board:
Clothes not hung: 1 demerit.
Making ridiculous excuse for
same: 2 demerits.
Aside to Pete Catanich: What's in
those big telegrams every other day?
A get-well-quick to Art Wcis
ner, in the hospital with infectious
mononucleosis, whatever that may
be.
The brighter side of life: fur
lough work sheets being distrib
uted, payday only a week away.
Rumor has it that a big parchesi
game was responsible for the nu
merous "touches" being made this
week. We always get wind of these
things too late.
