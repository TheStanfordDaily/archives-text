Wednesday afternoon, six young women in U.S. Army uni
form received Good Conduct Medals at Stanford.
The news value in that? Just this: When your brother comes
home from the front, if you find that the fascist animals have
bitten his leg off—he will still be able to enjoy the fruits of United
Nations victory. He will probably walk easily with an artificial
limb, and it will be because of the skill of these six young women
and their sisters in the Women's Army Corps.
Here at Stanford, a company of WACs—all college gradu
ates—spend six months studying physical therapy; after three
months in an Army hospital, they are commissioned to do their
work of healing heroes. According to Stanford's WAC com
mander, First Lieutenant E. L. Stephenson, invasion needs are
increasing demands for WACs—by the hundred thousand! (Her
office telephone number, for interested girls, is 21176.)
But these things are all obvious, you say. Well, if it's so
obvious, maybe you can tell us why the enemies' propaganda
about our Army women is so easily smuggled into many minds.
Maybe you can tell us why an ugly rumor about these patriotic,
hard-working women swept the country last year, only to be
traced directly to a Nazi agent later on.
Yes, lies about the morality and value of service women are
very useful to Hitler and Tojo—they hinder WAC recruiting, and
thus cut down the number of men available for the front.
Our Commander-in-Chief, President Roosevelt, summed up
the way soldiers who know the WACs' work feel, when he said
recently: "Those of us who have seen and know the work the
WACs are doing throughout out country, and in foreign stations,
have only admiration and respect for the spirit, the dignity, and
the courage they have shown."
WACs work at 155 types of Army jobs, from aeronautics and
administration to radio and mechanics. In their ranks are women
of every race, creed, and color. From Molly Pitcher and Harriet
Tubman to Lt. Stephenson and her company runs one unbroken
line of American democratic tradition.
