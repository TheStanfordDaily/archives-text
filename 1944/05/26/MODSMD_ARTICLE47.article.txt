# IN DAYS OF YORE

### 
In (he days when Stanford Roughs
were really rough, the finer senti
ments of Shakespeare's Romeo and
Juliet balcony scene were unappreci
ated according to the chronicles.
However, their sense of gentle
manly conduct would not allow them
to throw the usual raw eggs, to
matoes. etc. Instead they showered
poor unfortunates (?) with pennies.
That was before the*depression!
