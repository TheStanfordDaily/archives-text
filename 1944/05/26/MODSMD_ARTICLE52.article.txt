# Monroe Out-Errs Hayes Hall: Defaults Prevalent All Over
## 
### DICK BARTLE 
Intramural baseball struggled in
its tenth night of an eleven-night
season last evening with plenty of
excitement in the games that were
played and complete inactivity . in
three of five scheduled games, post
poned or defaulted. The IVled School,
the Firehouse, and Gerona A.C. held
fthe top of the standings because all
opponents defaulted.
Hayes took claim to a hall cham
pionship last night by making fewer
errors than Monroe and winning by
5-3. Smoke Morrison pitched ad
mirably for Hayes, allowing three
hits. The prominr at humorist Joe
Sher outdid him for the Boozers'
cause, allowing only two, but the
other nine Monroe boys might as
well have staved home to study.
Monroe proved especially generous
in the fifth inning when, leading one
to zero, they donated five runs to
Hayes by means of skillful muffs and
wild throws.
Hayes was less generous, although
they tried to even things up. Two
men were on base with one out in
the last of the seventh when Morri
son struck out two men in total
darkness.
Buchanan kept its perfect record
by being shut out by Garfield 4-0.
Bob Rosburg held Buchanan to two
hits while his teammates hit McKel
lar hard in the first two innings.
The superiority of independent
over hall teams was shown Wednes
day when Gerona trounced Hayes by
7-3. Three runs in the first inning
gave Gerona a lead they never lost.
The Leagle Eagles, in spite of the
cleverest name in the league, failed
to show against the Firehouse. It
was reported that the Eagles feared
that the new brown doors on the
Firehouse would inspire the boys to
lew heights. Tyler defaulted to the
Med School and Lincoln, blaming it
on the physics department, stayed
home to study instead of playing Ge
rona off.
Gerona challenges the Med School

in one of the most sensational gsmes
of the season next Saturday after
noon at 1:30. This fight will prob
ably produce the league champion.
