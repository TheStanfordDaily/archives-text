### DICK BLOCK 
Following a last-minute confer
ence in the palatial corridors of the
Daily Softball club, the powerful and
able team of editorial geniuses will
take to the field against the Chappies
at 4 p.m. today on the Sunken Dia
mond.

follows: Larrabee-38, Corman-C,
Lee-18, Zukin-SS, Sher-P, Davis-
SB, Fig-Hoblyn-LF, Adams - CF,
Shupe-SF, Block-RF.
It seems the Chappies have gained
enough courage to assemble an en
semble of 10 humorists. The lineup
as screamed by Barney Gugel, nom
de plume of the guy that writes Bull
Session, from the second floor of the
Journalism building (The Chappies
are frightened to enter the Daily of
fices fearing that they might be
signed to play for the Daily), is as
follows:

"Smoke" Morrison-P, Driscoll-28,
Reynolds-C, Koith-LF, Gugel-SF,
"Old Buy" Hyer-CF, Gilbert-RF.
Reviewing the two squads it is
very easy to fee the superiority ol
the Daily outfit. Of course it is not
our policy to favor one team or the
other, and we shall nut deviate from
our policy at this crucial period. (Oh
yeah!)
At this point the sports staff pre
