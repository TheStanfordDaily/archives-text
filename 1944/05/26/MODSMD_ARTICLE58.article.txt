Eiifht Years of Service
In his eight years of service here
at Stanford. Dr. Trueblood has been
of great value in increasing the re
ligious activities and religious spirit
on the campus.
He was instrumental in the form
ing of Chapel Board and in helping
various religious groups who wished

a more interdenominationally mind
ed man would be hard to find.
