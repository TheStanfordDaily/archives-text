## THE 						LEGEND OF LAKE LAGUNITA 
### BARNEY GUGEL 
Years ago, long before the first building at
Stanford was erected, Lake Lagunita did not
dry up in the summer; it was full and clear all
year long, and the creatures that dwelled in the
lake lived a peaceful and happy life.
A large black bass was king of the lake and
ruled the lake wisely. His only command was
that none of the creatures of the lake ever ven
ture into the deep spot in the center of the Lake
Lagunita. And none of them ever did.

Early one summer a group of Indians set up
a camp on the shore of the lake. Each day the
Indians would canoe out on the lake and gather
water cress. Unfortunately the creatures of the
lake lived on the water cress and gradually
their food supply was exhausted.
Soon only two clans of frogs and the great
black bass remained. The frogs ate insects that
flew over the lake but the great black bass had
no source of food. Finally the black bass called
in the leaders of the frog clans and demanded
that they allow him to eat one frog, each day so
that he would not die.
One of the leaders agreed, for he believed
that the word of the king was law. The other
refused and took his clan to the far end of the
lake where they lived in the protection of the
rocks.
CURIOSITY CALLS
One day the leader of the frogs who had sub
mitted to the command of the king was swim
ming by the deep spot in the center of the lake
where no one was supposed to go. His curiosity
got the best of him and he swam down into
the depths.
At the bottom of the lake he observed a large
metal plug. His curiosity satisfied, he swam
back, but just as he left the forbidden area, the
great black bass swam by. The king just smiled
and looked the other way.
The next day the leader of the other clan of
frogs was passing the forbidden area, and he
too decided that since no one was around he
might as well investigate. So he swam down
and discovered the great metal plug. As he
swam back from the forbidden area, he also
met the king.
"OBLIGED TO EAT YOU"
"You have entered the forbidden depths,"
exclaimed the great black bass, "and, so having
broken the law of the lake, I am obliged to eat
you."
The frog began to flee and swam back into
the forbidden area with the great black bass
right behind him.
Knowing the frogs could hibernate in the
mud, the frog swam right to the great metal
plug and began to tug at it desperately. The
black bass came closer and closer. Just as the
bass was about to pounce upon the frog, the
plug came loose and the frog dived into the
mud. Water began to pour down the hole un
der the plug and the suct'on pulled the great
black bass in too. Soon the lake was entirely
dry.
Each year since then, the rain fills up the
basin in the winter and th* frog comes out of
the mud. But when summer comes around the

frog returns to the bottom of the lake without
fail, and pulls out the plug. And that is the
reason why the lake dries up each summer.

that they allow him to eat one frog, each day so
that he would not die.
One of the leaders agreed, for he believed
that the word of the king was law. The other
refused and took his clan to the far end of the
lake where they lived in the protection of the
rocks.
CURIOSITY CALLS
One day the leader of the frogs who had sub
mitted to the command of the king was swim
ming by the deep spot in the center of the lake
where no one was supposed to go. His curiosity
got the best of him and he swam down into
the depths.
At the bottom of the lake he observed a large
metal plug. His curiosity satisfied, he swam
back, but just as he left the forbidden area, the
great black bass swam by. The king just smiled
and looked the other way.
The next day the leader of the other clan of
frogs was passing the forbidden area, and he
too decided that since no one was around he
might as well investigate. So he swam down
and discovered the great metal plug. As he
swam back from the forbidden area, he also
met the king.
"OBLIGED TO EAT YOU"
"You have entered the forbidden depths,"
exclaimed the great black bass, "and, so having
broken the law of the lake, I am obliged to eat
you."
The frog began to flee and swam back into
the forbidden area with the great black bass
right behind him.
Knowing the frogs could hibernate in the
mud, the frog swam right to the great metal
plug and began to tug at it desperately. The
black bass came closer and closer. Just as the
bass was about to pounce upon the frog, the
plug came loose and the frog dived into the
mud. Water began to pour down the hole un
der the plug and the suct'on pulled the great
black bass in too. Soon the lake was entirely
dry.
Each year since then, the rain fills up the
basin in the winter and th* frog comes out of
the mud. But when summer comes around the

frog returns to the bottom of the lake without
fail, and pulls out the plug. And that is the
reason why the lake dries up each summer.
Years ago, long before the first building at
Stanford was erected, Lake Lagunita did not
dry up in the summer; it was full and clear all
year long, and the creatures that dwelled in the
lake lived a peaceful and happy life.
A large black bass was king of the lake and
ruled the lake wisely. His only command was
that none of the creatures of the lake ever ven
ture into the deep spot in the center of the Lake
Lagunita. And none of them ever did.
INDIANS INVADE
Early one summer a group of Indians set up
a camp on the shore of the lake. Each day the
Indians would canoe out on the lake and gather
water cress. Unfortunately the creatures of the
lake lived on the water cress and gradually
their food supply was exhausted.
Soon only two clans of frogs and the great
black bass remained. The frogs ate insects that
flew over the lake but the great black bass had
no source of food. Finally the black bass called
in the leaders of the frog clans and demanded
that they allow him to eat one frog, each day so
that he would not die.
One of the leaders agreed, for he believed
that the word of the king was law. The other
refused and took his clan to the far end of the
