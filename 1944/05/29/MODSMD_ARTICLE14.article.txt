To the Editor:
To paraphrase Dave Davis somewhat, Excom
has devised a workable and sane social policy
by its new law, "A date for any off-campus
function sponsored by a group or an individual
must be applied for to Excommittee two weeks
prior to the occasion." Perhaps it is workable;
perhaps it is sane, but its wording is so vague
as to be stupid, or else it is so direct as to be
frightening to the freedom of Stanford students
on and off campus.
Does it actually mean that any one person or
a group of persons who wish to hold a party—a
socially personal and private gesture — must
first ask Excom if it is all right with them? If
so, it is no less than a social dictatorship that is
being slammed in the faces of the Stanford stu
dents, for we had nothing to say in the matter!
It seems that no longer do we have the Amer
can right to congregate with whom we please
or where we please unless Excom sees fit to
approve of our action! It is too bad that the
evecutive heads of our University think that
they must act as a mother with her 5-year-old,
"No, you can't give a party away from home
because—because I say so." No other reason
given because the child obviously wouldn't
understand anyway, or so she reasons.
But we forgot, Stanford students aren't 5-year
olds, are they? Or does Excom think so—or is
Excom doing the thinking in this action? Surely
a group of student-elected, student-representa
tive leaders would appreciate and favor the
social freedom Stanford has heretofore given us
—and them. If there is pressure being brought
to bear, where is it coming from? Or are we
stepping on hallowed, righteous, tyrannical
grounds?
As long as there is a Stanford University—
and a Stanford student, and a Stanford Spirit,
the Stanford Family (at least those who dare)
will congregate in what may be termed by
Excom as an "off-campus" function without
going through the formality of applying two
weeks in advance for permission to hold, say,
a going-away party for one of the fellows. It is
not the action that is wrong; it is the law making
it so.
Let us hope that the new Excom will have the
"intestinal fortitude" to stand on their own feet
—and rule the school with intellectual, social,
and political freedom without yielding to the
pressure put upon them by some of the Stan
ford "family" who may have forgotten what it
is to be young—and free. Sincerely,

To Stanfordites and Friends,
With the announcement that the Off-Campus
Con Home Drive brought in a record-breaking
$2,970, should go sincere thanks to all those on
and off campus who contributed in any way,
whether through time, money, or work at solic
iting.
Special recognition should go to a number of
individuals: Carol Hurwitz, Carol Swasey,
Elizabeth Leisk, and to the 60 couples whose
names have been listed ad infinitum in former
Dailies. To the merchants who volunteered the
prizes, to the Palo Alto Police Department for
their work in making out solicitors' permits, to
the Kappas, who hashed at the send-off dinner
for the couples, go additional thanks in making
the drive a success.
The time and effort expended by Mr. Paul
Davis, and by President and Mrs. Tresidder
was likewise gratefully received. And an addi
tional wcijd of ■ appreciation should go to Mrs.
Tibby of the Women's Clubhouse and to Lu
cretta, the cook of the Alpha Phi's.
There are more, of course. Everyone who
helped in any way should receive our personal
thanks for making this the most successful of
all the off-campus Con Home drives.

the Stanford Family (at least those who dare)
will congregate in what may be termed by
Excom as an "off-campus" function without
going through the formality of applying two
weeks in advance for permission to hold, say,
a going-away party for one of the fellows. It is
not the action that is wrong; it is the law making
it so.
Let us hope that the new Excom will have the
"intestinal fortitude" to stand on their own feet
—and rule the school with intellectual, social,
and political freedom without yielding to the
pressure put upon them by some of the Stan
ford "family" who may have forgotten what it
is to be young—and free. Sincerely,

To Stanfordites and Friends,
With the announcement that the Off-Campus
Con Home Drive brought in a record-breaking
$2,970, should go sincere thanks to all those on
and off campus who contributed in any way,
whether through time, money, or work at solic
iting.
Special recognition should go to a number of
individuals: Carol Hurwitz, Carol Swasey,
Elizabeth Leisk, and to the 60 couples whose
names have been listed ad infinitum in former
Dailies. To the merchants who volunteered the
prizes, to the Palo Alto Police Department for
their work in making out solicitors' permits, to
the Kappas, who hashed at the send-off dinner
for the couples, go additional thanks in making
the drive a success.
The time and effort expended by Mr. Paul
Davis, and by President and Mrs. Tresidder
was likewise gratefully received. And an addi
tional wcijd of ■ appreciation should go to Mrs.
Tibby of the Women's Clubhouse and to Lu
cretta, the cook of the Alpha Phi's.
There are more, of course. Everyone who
helped in any way should receive our personal
thanks for making this the most successful of
all the off-campus Con Home drives.

To the Editor:
To paraphrase Dave Davis somewhat, Excom
has devised a workable and sane social policy
by its new law, "A date for any off-campus
function sponsored by a group or an individual
must be applied for to Excommittee two weeks
prior to the occasion." Perhaps it is workable;
perhaps it is sane, but its wording is so vague
as to be stupid, or else it is so direct as to be
frightening to the freedom of Stanford students
on and off campus.
Does it actually mean that any one person or
a group of persons who wish to hold a party—a
socially personal and private gesture — must
first ask Excom if it is all right with them? If
so, it is no less than a social dictatorship that is
being slammed in the faces of the Stanford stu
dents, for we had nothing to say in the matter!
It seems that no longer do we have the Amer
can right to congregate with whom we please
or where we please unless Excom sees fit to
approve of our action! It is too bad that the
evecutive heads of our University think that
they must act as a mother with her 5-year-old,
"No, you can't give a party away from home
because—because I say so." No other reason
given because the child obviously wouldn't
understand anyway, or so she reasons.
But we forgot, Stanford students aren't 5-year
olds, are they? Or does Excom think so—or is
Excom doing the thinking in this action? Surely
a group of student-elected, student-representa
tive leaders would appreciate and favor the
social freedom Stanford has heretofore given us
—and them. If there is pressure being brought
to bear, where is it coming from? Or are we
stepping on hallowed, righteous, tyrannical
grounds?
As long as there is a Stanford University—
and a Stanford student, and a Stanford Spirit,
the Stanford Family (at least those who dare)
will congregate in what may be termed by
Excom as an "off-campus" function without
going through the formality of applying two
weeks in advance for permission to hold, say,
a going-away party for one of the fellows. It is
