# Daily Diamondeers Dynamite Dream; Down Dastardly Drinkers, 3 to 1
## 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
Behind the one-hit pitching of Cub
Reporter Joe Sher, the powerful
Daily Edit Board baseball team
pounded the Chappies into submis
sion, 3 to 1, Friday afternoon.
Striking early and hard, the Daily
bats pounded a two-run barrage in
the first inning. Cub Reporters P. G.
Lee and Bob Larrabee scored for the
Daily's first two markers on a suc
cession of Chaparral errors in the
field.
After a shaky start, the Chappies
gave Hurler Smoke Morrison a little
support, and the inning ended with
no further scoring.
Opening the Daily half of the sec
ond with a bang, Cub Reporter Bob
Rosburg pounded out a four-bagger

to center, making the score 3 to 0 for
the newsmen. At this point the con
test began to look a little one-sided,
and the moans of Old Boy Bill Hyer
began to be heard from far off l ight
field. Morrison, however, finally be
gan to find the plate and allowed
only two Daily hits for the rest of the
game, doubles by Cub Reporter Dick
Shnpc and Sports Editor Roger Cor
man.
Daily officials commented on the
happy coincidence of the signing of
five cub reporters one week before
the game.
Chappie bosses were inclined to be
a bit bitter until it was pointed out
that their only run was chalked up
by Cub Humorist Frank Cassela on
Cub Humorist Bill Nunn's single.

[ which was the only hit of the day for
! the Chappie men. Needless to say,
I Cassela and Nmm were appointed to
[ the Chappie board one week before
I the game.
