### DOROTHY CHIN 
'"It's almost a foregone conclusion,"
said Dr. Shau Wing Chan, assistant
professor of Chinese and humanities,
"that the mutual understanding be
tween the people of America and
China must be increased to aid post
war plans. Mutual understanding
will help bring the two nations closer
together."
Dr. Chan made his first trip to the
United States in 1930 and entered
Stanford as a graduate student. Com
pleting his studies in 1937, he re
turned to China intending to teach
in the northern part of China. The
outbreak of the war, however, pre
vented this.
Returns to America
Therefore that same year Dr. Chan
came back to America. Since his re
turn he has been a member of the
Stanford faculty. In past summers
Dr. Chan has also taught at Utah
State College.
At present Dr. Chan is devoting
most of his time to the AST language
group. He realizes that the boys are
trying very hard to learn Chinese,
and he thinks that they are doing
very well.
Dr. Chan's Book
'"Chinese Reyder for Beginners,"
written by Dr. Chan, is used by all
Stanford "Chinese language classes
and by other colleges which offer
courses in this language. During
whatever free time he now has, Dr.
Chan is working on the enlargement
of this book in scope and vocabulary.
Dr. Chan has also made Elemen
tary Chinese Flash Cards to further
aid the student in the study of the
language. Stroke Chart for Writing
Chinese Characters was just com
pleted by him and they will be
printed in June.
Dr. Chan feels that if his students
have been able to learn some of the
true facts about China and her people
from him, he has fulfilled one of his
duties as a member of the Stanford
faculty.
