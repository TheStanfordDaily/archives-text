# 'Madame Cellarfly,' 'P.O. Blues' Save First Night Spring Show Performance
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Seen from a first-nighter*s viewpoint, the 1944
Spring Show, produced last Friday and Satur
day nights, was a poor substitute for the never
to-be-forgotten Gaieties.
! Slowed up in the first act by technical diffi
culties and an overload of mediocre numbers,
the show rolled gradually into the climactic
second act, which with its dance routines and
Cellar operetta redeemed to an extent the fore
going performances.
TILLSON RENDERS "BLUES"
Notable among the numbers of the first act
was Tillson's "You Name It—l Sing It Blues,"
which pulled the show out of its downgrade,
and got the audience in the mood for the riotous
(and authentic) biology skit that followed. Don
Sharp's "Smellson Eddy" got a big laugh for
his fine rendition of a well-worn gag.
The opening Ida routine of the second act was
sparkling and well-timed. Peggy Fitts deserves
unending applause for her skit in the audience,
with Jean "Unbeatable" Levinson appearing at
the last, to make this one ot the evening's best.
"Africana" easily outranked the other inter
pretive dances staged to that point.
SUPPERMAN, CRUDELIA STAR
Rena Jean Black, a newcomer and easily the
individual hit of the show, gave Jane Frasier's
blues tune, "The Box Kent Lament," a sendoff
deservinq of its author. Miss Black appeared

again in "Madame Cellarfly," an operatic take
off on guess-what-place, which starred Jack
Taylor as Supperman, Peggy Hoover as Cru
delia, and "Legs" Levinson as Miss Creamface.
Well staged, cleverly written, and bursting with
talent, this skit outranked all others in the show.
"Red Hot and Blue" brought back Miss Till
son, singing in the inevitable Tillson style. She
didn't have the material in this show that she
needed to make her the star she should've,
could've, and would've been. Janice Shaugh
nessy's "St. Louis Blues" vocal was distinctive
and very good. Standouts in this act were the
colorful, interpretive set, and the dancing of
Corky Woliman and Don Bluh.
GILLESPIE BLUES GOOD
Miss Frasier's finale closed a show that was
spotty in places painfully amateurish. Indi
viduals in Dick Flint's band were outstanding,
but as a unit they lacked good timing and out
standing arrangements. The sets alternated be
tween far-fetched and the very good notable
were those for "Red Hot and Blue" and "Seven
Come Heaven.'' The singers were all good,
with particular note going to Jane Gillespie's
"Sub-Deb Blues."
So we come to the end of another Spring
Show. Let it be said that they did their best, and,
perhaps with additional rehearsals and a re
write man for Act One, they would have re
oeated the Gaieties.

day nights, was a poor substitute for the never
to-be-forgotten Gaieties.
! Slowed up in the first act by technical diffi
culties and an overload of mediocre numbers,
the show rolled gradually into the climactic
second act, which with its dance routines and
Cellar operetta redeemed to an extent the fore
going performances.
TILLSON RENDERS "BLUES"
Notable among the numbers of the first act
was Tillson's "You Name It—l Sing It Blues,"
which pulled the show out of its downgrade,
and got the audience in the mood for the riotous
(and authentic) biology skit that followed. Don
Sharp's "Smellson Eddy" got a big laugh for
his fine rendition of a well-worn gag.
The opening Ida routine of the second act was
sparkling and well-timed. Peggy Fitts deserves
unending applause for her skit in the audience,
with Jean "Unbeatable" Levinson appearing at
the last, to make this one ot the evening's best.
"Africana" easily outranked the other inter
pretive dances staged to that point.
SUPPERMAN, CRUDELIA STAR
Rena Jean Black, a newcomer and easily the
individual hit of the show, gave Jane Frasier's
blues tune, "The Box Kent Lament," a sendoff
deservinq of its author. Miss Black appeared

again in "Madame Cellarfly," an operatic take
off on guess-what-place, which starred Jack
Taylor as Supperman, Peggy Hoover as Cru
delia, and "Legs" Levinson as Miss Creamface.
Well staged, cleverly written, and bursting with
talent, this skit outranked all others in the show.
"Red Hot and Blue" brought back Miss Till
son, singing in the inevitable Tillson style. She
didn't have the material in this show that she
needed to make her the star she should've,
could've, and would've been. Janice Shaugh
nessy's "St. Louis Blues" vocal was distinctive
and very good. Standouts in this act were the
colorful, interpretive set, and the dancing of
Corky Woliman and Don Bluh.
GILLESPIE BLUES GOOD
Miss Frasier's finale closed a show that was
spotty in places painfully amateurish. Indi
viduals in Dick Flint's band were outstanding,
but as a unit they lacked good timing and out
standing arrangements. The sets alternated be
tween far-fetched and the very good notable
were those for "Red Hot and Blue" and "Seven
Come Heaven.'' The singers were all good,
with particular note going to Jane Gillespie's
"Sub-Deb Blues."
So we come to the end of another Spring
Show. Let it be said that they did their best, and,
perhaps with additional rehearsals and a re
write man for Act One, they would have re
oeated the Gaieties.
Seen from a first-nighter*s viewpoint, the 1944
Spring Show, produced last Friday and Satur
day nights, was a poor substitute for the never
to-be-forgotten Gaieties.
