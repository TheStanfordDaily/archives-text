ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP)â€”American troops have battled to within
sight of Rome, capturing Artena and opening the new all-out drive for the
Eternal City across the Alban hill while Canadian troops have occupied
Ceprano on the Via Casilina splitting the enemy front in the Liri Valley, it
was disclosed tonight.
Robert Vermillion ol the United Press talked to American troops who had
scaled the towering rock ledge aobve Artena, 18 miles southeast of Rome,
and seen the skyline of the Italian city yesterday. American tanks and
artillery deployed today from Artena into the open fields toward Valmon
tone, main bastion of the Germans' "Rome" line, two and one-half miles to
the north.
American tanks battled into the outskirts of Velletri at the southeastern
base of the Alban hills and infantry men opened a frontal assault at 11 a.m.
on the rugged range which extends within eight miles of Rome. A blistering
15-minute barrage preceded the attack which apparently caught the Ger
mans oft' guard since the doughboys were able to advance 2.000 yards in
the first hour against only slight resistance.
A special allied communique announced a battery of fresh triumphs on
the front to the southeast where German rear guards were stiffening their
resistance in fierce battles.
