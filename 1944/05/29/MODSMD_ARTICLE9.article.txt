LONDON, May 29 (UP) — America's greatest air armada of the war
blasted Germany's vital synthetic oil plants around Liepsig yesterday for
the second time this month, shooting down 93 enemy fighters in furious
air battles that caught 34 heavy bombers and 13 fighters.
More than 1,000 heavy bombers accompanied by 1,250 lighters, the greatest
escort force ever provided an American raiding formation feinted at Berlin
and then went southward to oil-making plants at Merseburg, Zeitz, and
Lutzkendorf, the latter 20 miles northwest of Liepsig.
German intercepters attacked the raiders in groups of 75 to 100, setting
oil the greatest air battle since the last raid on the same target May 12 in
which 44 bombers and 10 fighters were lost against 150 German planes shot
