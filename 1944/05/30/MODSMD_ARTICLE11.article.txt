# WHERE'S THE DIME?
## 
### 
THERE ARE just 33 days until the members of the class of '44
will receive their diplomas in the amphitheater. Thirty-three
days in which to finish up all the unfinished business that has
accumulated during tHe past four years and also to take care of
all the details necessary for the formal exercises of graduation
itself.
One of the major features of any graduation is the sending of
announcements to the friends and relatives of the graduates be
fore the ceremony takes place. The members of the class of
'44 would like to do this also, but no arrangements have been
made as yet so they can.
Yesterday afternoon the secretary of the class said that stu
dents could now order their announcements at the Bookstore.
The only difficulty is that before individuals can £>lace an order,
the senior class must make arrangements with the Bookstore
for the ordering of the invitations and announcements. This,
according to a member of the Bookstore staff, had not been done
previous to yesterday afternoon. —Esther Belew
