WONDER what is behind all this logic the Japanese keep throw
ing us via the propaganda route?
Now they pop up with the idea that they are the benevolent
men from the land of the Rising Sun whose sole purpose in
spearheading their armies toward Australia was principally to
stay the might of the American Army. In other words—they had
Australia's best interests at heart and wanted to protect the
Australians from the Americans.
We are not so sure that they aren't so dumb doing just such
a thing at this point. They feel this way. Well, the Americans
have been in Australia now for some time and they have married
a good many Australian girls.
The Jap goes on to figu/e that the Australians are just about
getting sick of having so many Americans around and resentment
should be mounting because of the number of the Aussie-Ameri
can nuptials. In some respects, the Japanese may figure right.
Perhaps there are some Aussie boyfriends and some parents who
resent having their daughters taken 10,000 miles away from them.
It's these people the Japs want to speak to. It's these people they
hope listen to their broadcasts. It's all designed to create disunity
among the United Nations.
Frankly, the whole situation boils down to this. The Aus
tralians are still grateful—as are the British —to the Americans for
walking in and taking over when they did. It preserved the
British Empire and saved the Aussies' necks.
Australia is a temporary American annex for the duration of
the war because of the number of U.S. soldiers. To date all these
boys have been well received, wined and dined, and treated as
though they had always lived there. This is the way the Aus
tralians have of showing for America's support in
Australia's hour of danger.
So the bitterness and resentment the Jap is counting on in the
Aussies is in such a minority it is of little or no value to the
Nip for propaganda purposes. When Tokyo propagandists find
out that this line of patter is ineffective, they will do a turn about,
get mad, and do some name calling. The anonymity of short
wave radio is conducive to long-range epithets and invective
hurling. This should teach us one thing—be on our guard about
anything detrimental to the armed services or the war effort. So
many times these things come right from the hearts of the fore
most enemy propagandists. Remember—those guys are in this
war up to their necks. It's their bread and butter and their lives
so they've got to show something for their wage. Usually it pops
up on our homefront or here via the lo.<yo c: Beilin radio.
