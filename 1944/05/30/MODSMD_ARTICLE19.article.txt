# Buchanan Men Challenge Girls to Softball Tilt
## 
### DICK BLOCK 
It anyone has been following the
intramural standings listed about
once a week on this page, they
would have seen the Meds, Fire
house, Hayes, and other top-fight
organizations right at the head of the
listings. But maybe they forgot to
look at the bottom of the list; after
all the teams down there did not
matter anyway. They were just the
■k-ljows who won or lost, and it
"ally was not important whichever
way their games went.
As we said there were the smooth
ies, but there were the roughs also.
The ( unpolished diamonders who
played every Tuesday and Thursday,
rarely received much credit.
One of the teams that started the
season at the bottom, and contrary to
all exciting sports stories stayed
there, was the Buchanan Hall Bear
cats. The freshmen at Buchanan
dropped their first game to Lincoln,
and kept on coming out on the short
end for the rest of the season until
last Thursday when they played
Garfield. But the Bearcats never had

a chance to growl; it was more of a
purr. They lost again.
Now this is a very sad story. We
' could tell you of the hard luck Buke
I had—of the loss of the pitcher, the
shortstop and about 10 other athletic !
young men to General Hershey's |
talent scouts—that necessitated using i
sports writers loward the waning [
weeks of the season.
Let us leave the excuses and get to
the point. Buchanan knows that the
season is now over for them, but |
they want to win just one game,
j The boys have put their heads to
| gether and have reached an amiable
! solution.
Here 'tis: Buchanan Hall chal- 1
lenges any girls' team to an exciting
seven-inning soft ball game to be
played this week. The team can be
one of the already organized groups j
or it may be an all-star aggregation. !
This challenge is a memorable oc- 1
; casion in Stanford history. Now is
! the time for the gals to show these
j guys, so come on all you feminine
Jo DiMaggios, take up the challenge
! and prove your worth.
