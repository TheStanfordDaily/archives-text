Late in the afternoon we went for i
a walk around the grounds and we !

the lawn and benches. We heard the

joyed it very much.
Yesterday we ate our lunches out '
on the lawn too.
We all thank you, all again for !

Dear Students of Stanford University, â€¢
Thank you very much for cleaning j
up the grounds, the stuffed animals,
the money, and the box lunches. At
lunch time when we got the box
lunches we were all very surprised
and we all liked the food. We all
thought it was one of the best 1

lunches we had since we've been
here. The grounds certainly look
better too. Last night when we were
all in bed we heard you talking over
the loud speaker at the Stanford
Unit. We heard some of the girls
singing .and one of the boys telling
jokes. Thank you again for all
you've done.
Sincerely yours,
Marianne Wolff.
