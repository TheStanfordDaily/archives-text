# Nitery Booth Aids Foreign Students
## 
### 
The International Club will spon
sor an information booth in the
Nitery, every weekday from 11 a.m.
until 2 p.m., according to Marianne
Lion, vice-president of the club.
Foreign students can come and ask
any kind of question that they may
wish. The purpose of the desk in the
Nitery is to let these students know
more about campus activities and to
give them directions.
In the Nitery there will be a bulle
tin board with a map and an ex
planation in simple English of the
events of the week. The chairman in
charge of the desk committee is
Both Weir; they will be glad to see
any and all foreign students from
Monday until Friday, at the stated
times.
'Marianne Shipley heads another of
the International Club's committees.
This group will write letters to in
coming foreign students, in their own
language, and will meet the students
when they arrive in Paly. These per
sonal contact letters are to inform the
new students of Stanford's welcome
and to help the newcomers find a
place to live on campus.
A reg committee, under the direc
tion of Esther Belew, will be waiting
to greet new foreign students on Reg
Ray. The committee will have a
booth outside of the Ad building for
new students.
