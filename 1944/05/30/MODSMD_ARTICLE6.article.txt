# DEPARTMENT OF UTTER CONFUSION (SOCIAL POLICY DIVISION)
## 
### 
To say that there is some confusion regarding
the "new" social policy of Excom and Stanford
University would be a masterful understate
| ment.
Some people are carried away by this con
! fusion, others discuss totally irrelevant issues,
[ the rest mutter about the situation vaguely and
j politely, then ignore the confusion. Excom, of
course, cannot avoid the discussion and neither
can the Daily. Therefore the Daily will try to
point out just what the issue is in respect to
social policy, the Excom legislation in respect
to the issue—then let the opinions and chips
fall where they may.
The issue is primarily this: how much re
sponsibility has Excom (the government of our
student body) and the University (a private in
stitution which grants us the privilege of at
tendance) toward Stanford students when they
leave the Farm? Answer that guestion and the
entire problem of a "black-and-white" social
' policy is solved. Excom has answered the
problem with the ruling that any off-campus
function, sponsored by an individual or an
organization, must have the okay of Excom.
This rule does not mean that Excom is creat
ing a social dictatorship. It means that Excom
is fulfilling its conception of responsibility to
the students who have elected its members. It
is no fun for one student to try to solve the
problems of another student—yet, it is a demo
cratic process and we are fortunate that Stan
ford administrators realize this. Therefore, if a
, problem of social policy exists, the students are
expected to solve it.

Granted that Excom has a responsibility to
the students and has formulated a regulation
concerning policy, we next come to a defini
tion of the regulation itself.
Does this mean that a Stanford man and a
Stanford woman cannot have a date at Dinah's?
If the Stanford man and the Stanford woman are
21. or are at Dinahs' for dinner, it is entirely
their own business. Does the regulation mean
that we have to apply to Excom to eat dinner at
Wilson's? Obviously not.
What does that regulation mean then?
The interpretation of that regulation depends
on what kind of Stanford man or woman the
questioner happens to be, and the kind of citi
zen he is or she is in this government. It means
that if the individual wants Excom, the Uni
versity, to stand behind him when he leaves
the campus he is willing to interpret the regu
lation in that intangible, yet very real Stanford
spirit. It makes no difference where a Stanford
man or woman goes as long as the Stanford
spirit —the Fundamental Standard—good con
duct—goes with them.
In this regulation Excom has attempted to
point out the tradition of self-responsibility at
Stanford, and the fact that when self-responsi
bility is recognized and undertaken Excom and
the University will stand behind every action
—or accident—in which a Stanford student is
involved.
Excom particularly invites any interested per
son to present his or her opinions on the subject
tomorrow night — Wednesday —at 7:15. The
Nitery will be used as a meeting place, instead
of the Excom room, so that there will be room
for everyone.—Dave Davis
