### 
ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP) — The German command threw every
available man and weapon tonight into desperate battle to stem allied
columns now only 16 1 ■> miles from Rome and saved the outflanked German
10th Army from a closing death-trap at Valmontone.
American tanks and planes began a systematic destruction of Velletri, 18

►.miles southeast of Rome and 10 miles
| southwest of Valmontone, as the
| Germans turned the town into an
; other Cassino in an effort to hold the
I mountainous base of their line.
Another American column drove
| within a mile of Valmontone itself
in an extension of the Artena salient,
pocketing the large groups of Ger
| mans who fought on to the death as
! snipers or saboteurs.
The British Eighth Army, rushing
nup from the southeast in a five
| mile-long gain today, drove within
i 30 miles of the Velletri-Valmontone
; front along the Via Casilina and to
| the north reached Arce, cutting the
I enemy's position alternate escape
road through Alatri.
Three German divisions 30,000
| to 45,000 men—were written off as
] virtually destroyed but Field Marshal
j Kesselring dipped into his reserves
j north of Rome for more men to hurl
I into the advancing allied vortex.
