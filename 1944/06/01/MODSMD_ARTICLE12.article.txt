# "Stand or Die", Germans Ordered
## Allies Flank Attack 15 Miles from Rome 
### 
ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP) â€”
Allied columns opened a double out
flanking drive today around the Al
ban Hill where the crack Hermann
Goering division, under orders to
stand or die, counter-attacked in
cessantly against U.S. armored forces
holding a salient within 15 miles of
Rome.
To the left of the hill, British
forces made a "considerable ad
vance'" following the route of the
coastal railroads into Rome. Reynold
Packard of the United Press reported
in a front dispatch. To the right,
American tanks by-passed ruined
Vellcteri and struck across the base
of the hill toward the Via Casilina
behind Valmontone raked by every
gun that the Germans could bring to
bear.
British tanks smashing into the
enemy's west flank found powerful
defenses in depth and it appeared the
Germans had set up a system of pill
boxes and gun implacements cover
ing all of the 15 miles to Rome in that
sector.
French Moroccan troops to the
southeast, meanwhile, made a spec
tacular 18-mile advance and cut the
enemy's last lateral escape road be
low the Via Casilina by capturing
Carpineto.
