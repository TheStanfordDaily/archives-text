# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
I have been sitting around quietly and pa
tiently, wondering when a good reason for the
latest Excom Proclamation would be forthcom
ing. As yet the necessity of this edict has yet
to be explained. Mr. Davis in his article entitled
"Department of Utter Confusion (Social Policy
Division" speaks of others discussing "totally
irrelevant issues," but offers no reason for the
new policy other than that the Excom mem
bers as representatives of the students passed
it.
If Stanford is a democracy, it would be sim
ple enough to put the question to a vote of the
entire student body unless, perhaps, Excom
would lose face. If the students should agree
with Excom, providing an election were held,
[ would gladly eat the paper on which this
letter is written (with peanut and jelly, of
course).
There is considerable question in my mind

as to how much the exalted Excom reflects
the wishes of the students. Most students ad
mit the usual need of Excom's okay for on
campus activities, but I bluntly say that it is
none of the Ex Committee's business what a
student does off campus if he maintains good
conduct.
And please don't come back with an argu
ment that an Excom okay of off-campus affairs
will help Stanford students be good little boys
and girls (not men and women). Since I grad
uate this July, I have no axe to grind and, there
fore, any ruling on this question would not
affect me. In the name of common sense, how
ever, this "law" should be repealed.
Respectfully yours,
Edward Washburn.
P.S.: Most important. It may be that the Ex
Committee is not to blame for this new policy
since they may be the fall guys and stooges
of higher ups. The students' representatives
seem to be metamorphosed into pawns once
they enter the Ex Committee room.
To the Editor:
To say that there is ulter confusion con
cerning the new social policy is to put it mildly.
One hears comments which range between "is
Excom trying to be a dictator?" and "this new
policy will be too lenient, and will lead Stan
ford students down the path of sin."
No one seems to recall what the "law" was
before the new policy was made â€” it read,
"No organized living group shall give an off
campus function." This rule was made when
the black-out dangers were present. It was found
that groups got around this ruling by giving
their money to one individual who supposedly
gave the party.
The new policy is to allow off-campus af
fairs, but ones which won't reflect improperly
on the University. Besides clearing the date,
the other pre-war regulations are again in ef
fect: patrons must be present, and no liquor
on the premises. No "individual parties" will
be affected, unless it is obvious that it is really
a "group" trying to get by the ruling.

To the Editor:
This whole discussion of off-campus func
tions is Excom's mistake. By making a loop
hole in their policy, that is, permitting appli
cations for a function two weeks in advance,
Excom has destroyed its aim.
Why should we be allowed to have a party
off campus? This is war. We have been asked
to refrain from off-campus activities. Think of
men and women in the armed forces. They
are under supervision all the time. Why should
we have privileges that they -don't have? If
the Army, the Navy, and all the rest, think it
is advisable to have their men supervised, why
then, supervision must be a good idea, for the
Army and Navy aren't so dumb.
No, I think the best idea is to allow no off
campus functions whatsoever. Most of us are
between the ages of 17 and 22; therefore I be
lieve the University ought to have complete
control over us. Of course, there are persons
in the armed forces our own age and they are
occasionally free from supervision, but after
all, they have had training in acting maturely
and how can we compare ourselves to them?
We elected Excom to represent us, and I
think they are doing a wonderful job, for aren't
we all of the opinion that our off-campus activi
ties should be their business? What gives us
the right to think we are old enough to take
care of ourselves? Excom is the boss and they
must do our thinking for us.
And in concluding I wish to say that I am
also in favor of lockouts for men after 8 o'clock
and having house mothers in charge. It is
disgusting to see so many Stanford students
at the Drive-in during the late hours of the
evening. Moreover, I think there should be
compulsory study periods at night. They would
certainly be for the good of everyone.
Yes, I think it is a modest proposal.
