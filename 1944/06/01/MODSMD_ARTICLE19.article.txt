### ROGER CORMAN 
To the Legal Eaglesâ€”
Come, come, gentlemen. Let's not
get the brittle beak here. In your
recent letter to my most noble and
august superior, Irma Cunha (I'm
sorry, but I have to say these things,
promotions are coming along soon),
you raked me over the coals and left
the bones for the vultures.
It seems that you found three
things wrong with my writing; my
stating that you forfeited to the Fire
house this season, my repeatedly
calling you the hapless Legal Eagles,
and the fact that I'm mad at you be
cause you beat Buchanan, the team I
fcplay for.
After studying your friendly little
missive, I find on the credit side the
fact that it was neatly typed on clean
good quality paper.
On the debit side, I find that your
three criticisms of me were pretty
good, except that they were totally
incorrect, and not based cm anything
approaching the facts.
It Was Written in English
The statement that you forfeited to
the Firehouse was not made by me,
as you can see by checking the by
line on the story that appeared in the
May 26 Daily. If I had made this
statement, I wouldn't be ashamed of
it anyway, for the truth is that you
did forfeit to the Firetiouse, as I
found out yesterday afternoon by
calling the Firehouse.
Persecution Complex?
In regard to calling you the hapless
Legal Eagles, I did not do this "time
and again" as you stated, but only
once all season. This word that seems
to offend you was used by me in the
May 25 issue of the Daily, and on no
other occasion, as you can see if you
wish to check the files in the sports
office.
Pure Fiction
Your third clever little statement
that I'm mad because you beat Bu
chanan, the team you claim I play
for, is not quite accurate, as I have
played ' for Lincoln all season, and
have not. participated in as much as
kone inning for the Bearcats.
