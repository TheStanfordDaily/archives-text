## 
### BILL ADAMS 
With the last round of intramural
baseball reeled off Tuesday night, one
oi' the most popular mural seasons of
the current year draws to a close.
The past season has produced some
mighty potent combinations, as well
as demonstrating the individual
ability of many heretofore little
known players.
Mod School, far and away the most
powerful squad in the league, swept
the circuit clean to take the pennant.
The pitching of Wayne Price, com
bined with strong hitting and smooth
fielding, were too much for 'the rest
of the league.
Firehouse ran a close second to the
Meds. losing only to them. Powerful
hitting and the pitching of Luke Pitts
were the firemen's main assets.
Hayes, in third place pending the
result of the post-season game be
tween Meds and Gerona, got by
mainly on the stellar pitching of
"Smoke" Morrison. Frank Casella
and Bill Walsh were standouts in an
otherwise mediocre fielding aggre
gation.
Gcrona's main asset was their

I smooth fielding, which proved the j
! nemesis of many a powerful team.
Monroe showed snatches of bril
! liatice on the mound, particularly j
I against Firehou.se and Buchanan; :
Tyler and McKinley split even on the
! season, showing occasional strength
I at the plate; hot and cold Garfield
j looked like a first division team at 1
j times, a grammar school squad at :
! others.
Leyal Eagles, Lincoln, and Isu
clianan occupied the league cellar, |
Lincoln beating only Buchanan, and j
the latter coming out with a goose
egg in the win column.
