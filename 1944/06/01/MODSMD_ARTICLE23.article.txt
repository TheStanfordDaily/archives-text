# At Excom Last Night..

### DAVE DAVIS 
Following the time-honored Amer
ican tradition of open meetings and
open discussion, during which every
citizen can speak his mind, Excom
last night heard Stanford students
speak on such varied topics as Amer
ican Youth for Democracy, the Fifth
War Loan, and the Social Policy.
Postponing a discussion of the So
cial Policy, Excom first heard from
representatives of a group of students
at Stanford who requested permis
sion to affiliate with a national or
ganization, American Youth foV De
mocracy.
Students who spoke for the request
pointed out that youth all over the
world are banding together to fight
intolerance, discrimination, and fas
cism, and that Stanford students in
terested in the fight should be al

! lowed to join a national organization. 1
Students who spoke'against grant
j ing the request felt that the acts of
' the national organizaion might re
â–  fleet against the University inasmuch
! as it was not entirely a student or
ganization, and was in part com- I
posed of Communists.
Excom denied the application of'
j the students to affiliate.
The Social Policy discussion served
1 to presage an all-stuuent forum to
: be held in the Ed Aud Monday night,
| at which a panel of faculty and stu
j dents would present the problem and
I its ramifications, then throw the
j meeting open to questions from the
j floor.
The plan received general appro
j bation from students who had I
, crowded the Nitery, and A.S.S.U.
! President Dick Driscoll entertained 5
| questions from those interested i
which will be used as topics for the j
panel to discuss.
Driscoll pointed out that Excom
wishes to formulate a social policy j
| not only workable, but acceptable to !
the majority of students. Details of
the coming forum will be announced ,
in tomorrow's Daily.
