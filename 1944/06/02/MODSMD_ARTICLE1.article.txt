# Yanks Fight In Sight of Rome Gates
## 
### 
ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP) â€”
American troops in a brilliant flank
ing thrust behind Aletre, have driven
three and one-half miles through the
last Rome defenses in the
Alban hills and tonight a climactic
battle was reported under way in
full view of the Holy City, only 13
miles behind the allied left flank.
By-passing Velleetri on the right,
then swerving to the west, Yank
units drove to the summit of 3,100-
foot Mount Peschio, the second high
est peak in the Colli Lasiali mass, of
which the Alban hills area is a part.
Vanguards immediately, swept down
into the bowl leading to the last, thin
rim of mountain defenses, three miles
away, beyond which Rome is a
downhill run to the northwest.
American artillery began bombard
ing these heights, concentrating on
Mt. Cavo.
The drive to Mt. Peschio apparent
ly caught the Germans off guard.
The main battle in the Alban hills
had been raging to the west in the
Lauvio-Genzano sector. Then allied
flanking drives were launched to
both sides, British armored units
driving to within 13 miles of Rome on
the left.
