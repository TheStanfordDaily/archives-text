# Monroe Hall Gives South Sea Sway
## 
### 
A tropical atmosphere, complete
with palm trees and tropical flowers,
native dancers, and a special brand of
tropical punch, will prevail at the
"South Sea Sway," being presented
by the Royal Hawaiians of Monroe
Hall tonight from 8 to 11:30.
"Ui Nui" Clark and "Nc Nc" Sup
ple, co-chairmen of the dance, an
nounced yesterday that plans to
transjorm the hall into an island
paradise were proceeding satisfac
torily. The dance chairmen have
once again secured Monroe's famous
public address system to carry the
music and announcements to all parts
of the hall.
Feature attraction for the evening
will be a native floor show, to be pre
sented at intermission by several
guest artists from Hawaii.
"Ui Nui" Clark will offer his oft
heard "Pidgin English Hula," as well
as one or two other native selections.
"Wawae Nui" Mossman, King of the
Hawaiian Ukulele, is scheduled to
follow "Ui Nui" with some genuine
Hawaiian music. Number one at
traction of the evening's program will
be two hula dances by Pi Phi Martha
Austin. Miss Austin learned the hula
during childhood; thus her presenta
tion is authentic as well as breath
taking.
Dance chairmen recommend that
dancers come sans shoes and thereby
enjoy themselves to the fullest ex
tent. Native garb is also recom
mended, although not required. Sa
rongs, especially, are acceptable, as
are flowered shirts and other beach
comber wear.
