## 
### DAVE DAVIS 
Branncr Hall lias been added to the
housing facilities for women, Dean
Mary Yost announced late yesterday
afternoon, since it is now possible
to convert the most modern of the
men's balls into a residence for new
lower division women for the dura
lion of the war.
Social standards and physical fa
cilities, including food service, will
be equivalent to what is offered in
other women's halls, with the cost of
room and board the same in all halls.
Large Number of Applications
The decision to convert Branncr
into a women's living group came
after an unusual number of appli
cations for entrance to Stanford, all
from lower division women who met
and in many cases more than quali
fied under present admission re
quirements.
With the University space avail
able, it seemed advisable, according
to Dean Yost, to make Stanford at
tendance possible for that many more
women. The first residents will move
in autumn quarter.
Branncr will be conducted the
sunie as other halls, with sponsors, a
director, an assistant director, and
the usual sign-out system.
One of the best features of the hall
is the kitchen, completely modern
ized by the Army, with excellent
refrigeration. This equipment can be
purchased by the University.
Two Housing Plans
With the extra number of appli
cations, housing accommodations
could have been arranged in one of
two ways: (1) conversion of frater
nity houses to small living groups
for women; (2) utilization of Bran
ner Hall. However, the problems
arising upon consideration of the
fraternity plan made it apparent that
Branncr Hall offered the only prac
tical solution.
Plans we're also announced for the
summer living program. The sorority
houses will be closed, Row women
living at Lagunita during the sum
mer quarter. Roble will also be
opened, and the Union unit closed.
Dean Yost also announced that.
Branncr will be used as a living
place for women only for the "dura
tion."
