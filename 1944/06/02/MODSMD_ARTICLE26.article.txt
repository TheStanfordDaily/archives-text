# The 						Social Humbug

What is this social humbug all about The
rumors have been gaining ground. Ex Commit
tee doesn't know what it's doing. They're a
bunch of stool pigeons the tools of the Deans,
who are really trying to run things. On and on
they go. Rumors and more rumors until finally
everyone is so excited that they get silly.
They get so silly and so completely carried
away that they begin to ask permission to get
their laundry in Paly. Everyone laughs, and
the whole thing becomes a big joke. Poor,
dumb Ex Committee, they say. Don't know
what they're doing.
Actually, Ex Committee is not dumb, the
Deans are not unduly concerned, and the whole
thing is not to be regarded as a joke. A look
at the facts should prove this.
Before the war, Ex Committee had a ruling
about off-campus functions. It stated that every
organization was to be allowed one off-campus
affor per year, that no liquor was to be served,
that an application blank for such a party was
to be signed by the Deans and Excom. There
was also to be a statement submitted by the
owner of the place where such function was
scheduled to the effect that no liquor would be
served. That was the way things were in the
"old days."
The war came, and on Jan. 9, 1942, Excom
initiated a new social policy. Big name bands
for campus dances were not allowed, and in
the interests of safety, good taste, and expense,
no living group was to hold an off-campus func
tion.
This rule was interpreted in various ways,
and Ex Committee realized that some persons
felt the rule should apply to any organizationâ€”
not merely living groups.
And then, after the Gaieties cast party at Ros
sotti's last fall, the matter was brought to the
attention of the present Ex Committee: several
freshman women returned from the party late
and in an intoxicated condition.
Excom ruled that the cast party was not a
Ram's Head party and therefore not an or
ganization function. But many persons com
plained about the definition of organization,
etc., and so Ex Committee began to plan a
policy that would be realistic and workable.
After four months of talking, debating, and
exchanging of ideas, Excom drew up and an
nounced their present rule: any individual or
organization sponsoring an off-campus function
must apply to Excom. And then, because many
students objected to the ruling, Excom issued
an invitation to Stanford students to attend their
meeting last Wednesday (although all Ex Com
mittee meetings are open to all students). The
response was good, many suggestions were
offered, and it was decided to have a panel and
forum discussion Monday night at 7:30 in the
Education Auditorium.
Then, after hearing what is said at this dis
cussion, Ex Committee will draw up a new
regulation one which they feel workable and
in accordance with the views of the students
they represent. The next step will be to pre
sent this new rule for approval or disapproval
of students at the polls.
And that's the way things are. It doesn't
require a very high I.Q. to see that the rule
during the "old days" was stricter. It's not
hard to see that there's nothing funny about the
problem. And when you consider that Wom
en's Council has had to handle five cases of
drunkenness this quarter, you must realize
that Stanford's reputation could easily slip.
So don't circulate around campus making a
lot of noise about the social policy situation. If
you've studied the problem, thought seriously
and logically about it, and you've got something
to say, say it. Otherwise remember that you
supposedly got over your smart-alecky manners
many years ago.
