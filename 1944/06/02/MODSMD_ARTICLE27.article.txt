Wednesday night the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students of Stanford denied a
local group the right to affiliate with their na
lional nameaske organizatoin.
This organization is the American Youth for
Democracy which is the direct outgrowth of for
mer Communistic organizations. It carries the
stigma of the word communism, the taint of com
munistic affiliations of its members. This is the
underlying reason why the Executive Commit
tee denied the local group the right to be offi
cially recognized at Stanford.
In principle, the action of the Executive Com
mittee is not to be condoned. But the commit
action should be deemed wise in liqh! of

I the ultimate good and benefit that Stanford will
receive.
If such an organization were allowed to affil
iate with a national group, which does not deny
communistic affiliations, the Stanford campus
would then become the focal point of discussion,
newspaper attacks and all types of unfavorable
publicity. It would be called a "hotbed of com
; munistic feeling."
The A YD, in order to further its own ends and
goals (as yet not sufficiently explained) wishes
to affiliate with as many liberal thinking groups
as possible. In this category falls the unsuspec
ting University groups, who attempt to petition
for national affiliation.
We saw and heard Wednesday night what
could probably be the fate of Stanford. A mem
ber of the California state AYD appeared be
fore the Executive Committee citing various
cases of other college groups, constantly refer
ring to them as the University of California
chapter or the San Jose State College chapter.
At California and San Jose State the AYD is not
officially recognized.
She had to be constantly reminded that
I neither California nor San Jose State had rec
ognized those groups, yet she persisted in re-,
ferring to them as such. The fate of Stanford's
reputation becomes obvious.
Should such an organization be recognized
by the A.S.S.U., it would be cited all across the
United States in various circles by AYD plug
j gers in order to cinch their recognition at Sub-
Normal U. or Podunk College.
The feeling in the United States against
, communism, as it is for all times of regimes for
eign to our way of life, is for the most part
universal. We know how we feel about a per
-1 son who is associated with any pinkish or
ganization. Stanford would fall in the same
category. The Farm would then gain a bad
! reputationâ€”something it cannot afford to do
in peacetime, let alone wartime.
The long-term policy of the Executive Com
mittee then becomes a wise move even in view
| of the comparatively mild events of Wednes
| day night. Comparatively mild when thought
of in light of what could have happened should
Stanford accept an organization such as the
American Youth for Democracy.
