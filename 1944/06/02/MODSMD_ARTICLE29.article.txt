# Bull Session

NOW THAT CHAPPIE
There has been great concern on campus
due to the fact that the Spring Chaparral has not
yet made its appearance. The mag was due to
be out last week and because of a tie-up in the
press will not appear until next Wednesday
or so.
At any rate it will be good. Old Boy Bill Hyer
said only yesterday,"The mag will be good
and stuff." After that, the Old Boy took your
Bullsessioner back into the print shop and
showed us some of the fine stuff that's going
into the Chappie. Not only were we amazed
by the high-type, clean-cut humor, but we feel
that the Spring Chappie will be the greatest
thing since Gutenberg invented the Bible.
