# Knitters Must Turn in All R.C. Yarn by June 20
## 
### 
All Red Cross yarn that has been
checked out from the Knitting Com
mittee must be returned by Tuesday,
June 20, and the article must be com
pleted, according to Sallie Van Dyke,
chairman.
The War Board is held responsible
by the Red Cross for all yarn checked
out, and therefore in order to obtain
more yarn in quarters to come all
yarn that has been checked out must
be returned. These articles are |
vitally needed by the services and
are sent to the different branches as
soon as thc-y are turned in. If any of
this material has been lost the girls
must pay the cost of the material.

The articles may be turned in at
the regular meetings on either Tues
days or Thursdays from 2 o'clock un
til 4 o'clock at Miss Yost's home.
Miss Van Dyke's office hours are
Wednesdays and Fridays from If to
f2 o'clock, and every afternoon from
1 until 2 o'clock at 22151. The last
meeting will be-on Tuesday, June 20,
when all yarn must be turned in.
Girls are still needed to sew afghan
squares together to make afghans for
the Red Cross. Those girls who put
their war hours in by rolling band
ages are urged to make afghans now
that the Bandage Rolling Room i.s
closed for the remainder of the
quarter.
