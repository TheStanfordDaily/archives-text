It seems as if sports in the United
States thrive on wars, despite the
terrific drain on players and funds
accompanying any conflict. A glance
at the record of attendances and gate
receipts at all sporting events during
the past year shows that many a rec
ord has been broken.
In last season's World Series be
tween the New York Yankees and
the St. Louis Cardinals, for example,
baseball attendance records reached
a new high as 277,312 spectators paid
to see the two teams slug it out for
the world's championship. The at
tendance record for any single pre
vious game was far exceeded, nearly
70,000 people paying to see the third
game of the series in New York.
On Memorial Day, last Tuesday,
the record for the total amount of
money bet on horse races at tracks
throughout the country was exceed
ed by about $3,000,000. The new fig
ure set on Memorial Day was over
$12,000,000. In spite of this, attend
ance records at tracks were not
broken except in a few places, but it
was close all over the country.
Football failed to draw larger than
the usual crowds in the 1943 season,
but records here, too, might have
shattered had all the 'schools which
field teams in peace time been able
to participate.

Every time that Mel Ott, player
manager of the improved New York
Giants, gets a hit in the current sea
son, he is breaking any or all of
three major league records. At the
end of last season, the slugging man
ager held the all-time record in the
National League for total hits, total
home runs, and total runs batted in.
This year Ott has already hit 10
circuit clouts which is considerably
more than he had hit at this stage of
the game in his best home-run sea
son, .1932, when he led the league
with 38.
Ott, who has been playing major
league baseball for 14 years, still has
an amazing eye. He has led the Na

tional League in home runs six dif
ferent times. In last Tuesday's
double-header with Boston, he hit
three pitches into the stands!
