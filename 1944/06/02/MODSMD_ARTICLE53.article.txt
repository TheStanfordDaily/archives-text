If you shoul.d hear big horse talk
| around Encina those days, chalk it
j up to Stutz Lehman and his crew,
I who had the pari-mutuels at Bay
! Meadows doing a fandango last
week-end. It seems that the boys
always picked the right nag, but bet
on the wrong one!
Clarification of an ugly rumor:
Big Jim was not temporarily insane
when he put that nickel in a juke
box.
Cutter Reese has originated a game
in this unit which bids fair to replace
gin rummy as a social pastime. His
little brainchild is known as 2-10-
Jack, and its history is amusing.
The Cutter couldn't best Harry Scott
J at any of the known games, so he
invented one. He can't beat Harry
at this one either.
j Things which strike a chord:
| The soldiers who, in this irreligious
| world, say grace before eating in the
I Encina mess hall and inspire self-
I examination among their buddies,
j The GI who feeds that tame squirrel
each afternoon. Watching the birds
bathe in Union Court fountain. . . .
Worth the fight?
Sidelights:
Prof. Knoles becoming informed
on GI slang after an unwittingly hu
morous experience. The ribbing Mr.
Garber takes about that blonde. The
I names given to the frogs in Bio. Lab.
Don Weinberg made national
treasurer of the BTO concurrent
witli the arrival of a consignment of
good things to eat!
Contrary to any stories you may
have heard, the Stanford Bookstore
was not founded by Jesse James.
A gentle reprimand to Pi Phi for
being so supercilious and condes
cending about making good on Soph
Carnival obligations.
UP THE HILL by Winnie of the
j WAC:
Newcomer to the WAC detach
i ment is Cpl. "Pat" Griffiths who ar-
J rived from Fort Des Moines, lowa,

MEET THE SARGE . . . Gloria
j Jasberg who calls Floral Park in
! Long Island, New York, her home.
When she graduated at Adelphi Col
; lege in February '43 she enlisted in
the WAAC. After basic at Fort
Oglethorpe, Georgia, she was sent to
| Stockton Field. There she remained
as a classification specialist until
j January when her orders brought
I her here. Gloria's Tri-Delt, plays
1 tennis and swims like a veteran, and
J has a bit of that wonderful New
| Yauk in her talk.
Twenty-six states and D.C. arc
i represented by the 40 girls who live
at the Pink Palace. WE're not plug
ging for a certain Chamber of Com
merce, but New York State has four

daughters, which puts her in the j
lead. Main civilian occupation of the ;
girls was teaching, with 24 school- j
marms now Jurned pupil. Half of
these were physical education in- |
structors. Other occupations, mostly j
one of a kind, include home econo- j
mist, secretary, sales manager, engi- J
neering clerk, social worker, credit |
manager, technical writer, recrea- i
tional director and interviewer.
Bachelor's degrees arc held by 31 j
of Stanford's WACs. Three of the j
girls have master's degrees and six ;
of them have done some graduate j
work. And there are four WACs
here who enlisted straight from col
lege. Veteran of the detachment is
T/4 Vella Parks who enlisted in Au
gust 1942. Before coming here she
was in Quartermaster at Des Moines
and at Camp Hale, ski troop center I

j in Colorado. All but four of Stan
; ford's WACs were members of the
I auxiliary corps when it became part
of the Army on Sept. 1, 1943.
