### 
Dr. D. Sterling Wheelwright, act
ing University organist, announced
that the first number in the organ
recital Sunday, June 4, will be Bor
owski's "Allegro, Sonata in A Minor."
This sonata shows a blend of organ
qualities in the opening sustained
medley and the choral theme.
Next on the program will be
"Three Mountain Sketches," by
Clokey. The third humber, a "witty
and unmistakable Russian fancy," is
Tchaikovsky's "Humoresque."
