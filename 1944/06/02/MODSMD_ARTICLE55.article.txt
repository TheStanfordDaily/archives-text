# Loyal Nisei Should Get Fair Deal--An Editorial
## 
### EDITORIAL By Sidney Rittenberg 
Corporal J. H. Kety, an American G.I. fighting on the Italian
fiont, put down his rifle to write Secretary Ickes a letter. The let
ter was about the problem of a few people who refuse to give
the loyal Nisei (American citizens of Japanese ancestry) a square
deal.
Said Cpl. Kety: "May I suggest you send all those narrow
minded, bigoted un-Americans over here to relieve the 100 th
Infantry Battalion?"
Said Ickes: "It is quite apparent you know what you are
fighting for."
But just what is Cpl. Kety so excited about, and what is the
100 th Battalion?
The 100 th is 1,000 American boys who have collected 3 DSC's,
36 Silver Stars, 21 Bronze Stars, and 900 Purple Hearts for wounds
and heroism in action—they are Nisei.
Captain Jack Mizuha, of the 100 th, says: "We, the American
born Japanese . . . did our share. Nobody asked us who we were.
We ask but little in return —that our hopes of being given a place
in the American scheme of life be realized. For that we are
willing to die, as many have already died."
What about Nisei not in uniform? There is one camp for
disloyal people —Tule Lake. That camp, and the few instances
in which resettled loyal Japanese have suffered from local preju
dice have been getting all the publicity. But do you know that
according to a government survey 73 per cent of the Nisei have
never seen Japan, 53 per cent of the rest had no schooling there,
there is not a single case of sabotage by a Nisei listed as loyal,
and in most places resettled Japanese have been welcomed into
patriotic American communities?
Yes, Capt. Mizuha, we think you and your men have earned
a square deal, even if giving you one weren't essential to our
own welfare. You see, American boys in uniform have no "spe
cial interest" in not treating you fairly; they have no urge to grab
Nisei-owned land; or exploit Nisei labor at sub-American stan
dards. They have only the urge to win the war as soon as pos
sible, and to fight gladly with whoever is on their side. Do the
Japanese militarists slyly tell their soldiers that they will be killed
if they surrender, because America fights a "race war?" Well,
our people will refute that lie, and help shorten the war.
Carl Sandburg, quoting a missionary, says:"The lot of the
Nisei in Japan was not wholly a happy one. Their relatives and
friends were bewildered and annoyed by these strange young
people who looked like Japanese but acted and thought like
Americans."
Toward the loyal, fighting Nisei—are you "acting and thinking
like Americans?"

Nisei-owned land; or exploit Nisei labor at sub-American stan
dards. They have only the urge to win the war as soon as pos
sible, and to fight gladly with whoever is on their side. Do the
Japanese militarists slyly tell their soldiers that they will be killed
if they surrender, because America fights a "race war?" Well,
our people will refute that lie, and help shorten the war.
Carl Sandburg, quoting a missionary, says:"The lot of the
Nisei in Japan was not wholly a happy one. Their relatives and
friends were bewildered and annoyed by these strange young
people who looked like Japanese but acted and thought like
Americans."
Toward the loyal, fighting Nisei—are you "acting and thinking
like Americans?"
Corporal J. H. Kety, an American G.I. fighting on the Italian
fiont, put down his rifle to write Secretary Ickes a letter. The let
ter was about the problem of a few people who refuse to give
the loyal Nisei (American citizens of Japanese ancestry) a square
deal.
Said Cpl. Kety: "May I suggest you send all those narrow
minded, bigoted un-Americans over here to relieve the 100 th
Infantry Battalion?"
Said Ickes: "It is quite apparent you know what you are
fighting for."
But just what is Cpl. Kety so excited about, and what is the
100 th Battalion?
The 100 th is 1,000 American boys who have collected 3 DSC's,
36 Silver Stars, 21 Bronze Stars, and 900 Purple Hearts for wounds
and heroism in action—they are Nisei.
Captain Jack Mizuha, of the 100 th, says: "We, the American
born Japanese . . . did our share. Nobody asked us who we were.
We ask but little in return —that our hopes of being given a place
in the American scheme of life be realized. For that we are
willing to die, as many have already died."
What about Nisei not in uniform? There is one camp for
disloyal people —Tule Lake. That camp, and the few instances
in which resettled loyal Japanese have suffered from local preju
dice have been getting all the publicity. But do you know that
according to a government survey 73 per cent of the Nisei have
never seen Japan, 53 per cent of the rest had no schooling there,
there is not a single case of sabotage by a Nisei listed as loyal,
and in most places resettled Japanese have been welcomed into
patriotic American communities?
Yes, Capt. Mizuha, we think you and your men have earned
a square deal, even if giving you one weren't essential to our
own welfare. You see, American boys in uniform have no "spe
cial interest" in not treating you fairly; they have no urge to grab
Nisei-owned land; or exploit Nisei labor at sub-American stan
dards. They have only the urge to win the war as soon as pos
sible, and to fight gladly with whoever is on their side. Do the
Japanese militarists slyly tell their soldiers that they will be killed
