# All-Campus Forum at 7:30 Will Reveal Social Policy
## 
### 
In a panel discussion to be held in the Education Auditorium tonight at
7:.!0, Stanford students will have a chance to hear and discuss the prob
lems of a social policy in the hope that Excom's recent ruling on ofT-campus
functions may be adjusted or revised to meet more universal approval.
A selected group of students and faculty will answer the following ques-

tions as they affect each particular *
field of student administration:
(1) What are the purposes of a
social policy? (2) A definition of the
terms involved in the question:
function, private party as opposed to
a group party, ofT-campus; (3) How
is the liquor problem connected with
the social policy? (4) What type of
social policy is most effective to meet
Stanford's problem?
Panel Discussion
Harry J. Rathbun, professor of law.
will act as an impartial chairman of |
the panel group, with Dick Driscoll, j
A.S.S.U. president; Luana Forkner,
A.S.S.U. vice-president; Courtaney
Pcrren, chairman of Women's Coun- j
cil; Marion Nielsen, and chairman of I
Women's Conference.
J. D. Williams, Exeom; Jim Rey- i
nolds, chairman of Men's Council; j
Bruce Jessup, graduate student; John i
Dunn. Dean of Men; and Mary Yost, I
Dean of Women, discussing each of
the four general questions as they j
apply to their particular branches of j
student life.
Speak Your Piece
At the conclusion of the panel
talks, the discussion will be thrown |
open to the audience at large, so that j
every student present may have a
chance to discuss the problem. Ques
tions may be put to individual mem
bers of the panel, or to the group as a
whole.
It is urged that each student come
to the discussion prepared to offer
suggestions and constructive criti- j
cism for betterment of the present |
Excom ruling. "Please don't come !
k just to tear down the ruling as it
P now stands," asked Jim Reynolds;
"often a discussion like this can get
out of hand, and it is to the benefit of
the students if they can offer some i
suggestions that will help Eveom ar- |
rive at a more feasible adjustment of I
the problem."
