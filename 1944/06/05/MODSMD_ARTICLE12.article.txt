# Bunn Presents Challenge At Leadership institute
## 
### 
Dean John Bunn, in his talk to the
Leadership Institute last Friday eve
ning, challenged Stanford students
with the statement, that since the
Farm student government possesses
powers almost unparalleled on other
campuses it is a responsibility and
an opportunity to use it wisely.
Dean Bunn, recently returned from
a conference in the East attended by
approximately 100 deans of men from
universities throughout the country,
spoke from the comparative view
point, stating that all other repre
sentatives with one exception were
troubled about the problem of stu
dent government in their universi
ties and were frankly admiring of
the success with which Stanford has
made use of its governmental poli
cies.
At Stanford the judicial system of
two councils now belongs to students,
whereas it formerly belonged to the
administration. At other universities,
Bunn pointed out, faculty members
read all copy before it went into the
campus newspapers; a contrast to the
Farm's liberal press policy.
Dean Yost, in her talk to the group,
explained how the administration
and the student government organi

zaliotis arc coordinated. She said that
the deans' offices attempted to pre
sent the long-range view to enthusi
astic student planners, who may not
realize the former experiments un

dertaken on the .same idea, or who
have not had the experience to re
alize the logical consequences of such
plans once put into effect.
Courtaney Perren, chairman of
Women's Council, discussed the
problem of educating students on the
Honor Code and on the social regu
lations. Suggestions were: (I) pub
lishing a booklet on the history of
the code, and (2) having a test for
all women students on the social
regulations.
The comment was made that all
sponsors should be educated in par
ticular fields in order to help incom
ing freshmen with their problems.
Jim Reynolds spoke, outlining the
Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code's functioning and pur
pose.
In next Friday's leadership meet
ing, the academic vice-president, Al-
J vin Eurich, and the financial vice
] president, Frank Walker, will be the
[ principal speakers.
Carol Hurwitz, war board head,
! Cally Curtis, student manager, and
j Irma Cunha, editor of the Daily, will
| speak on their jobs and their rcla
j tionship to the student government.
The meeting will be held in the main
! floor of the Women's Clubhouse.

OKAN or Ml'lN JOHN ISUNN.
speaker at Friday's Leadership
Institute.
Dean John Bunn, in his talk to the
Leadership Institute last Friday eve
ning, challenged Stanford students
with the statement, that since the
Farm student government possesses
powers almost unparalleled on other
campuses it is a responsibility and
an opportunity to use it wisely.
Dean Bunn, recently returned from
a conference in the East attended by
approximately 100 deans of men from
universities throughout the country,
spoke from the comparative view
point, stating that all other repre
sentatives with one exception were
troubled about the problem of stu
dent government in their universi
ties and were frankly admiring of
the success with which Stanford has
made use of its governmental poli
cies.
At Stanford the judicial system of
two councils now belongs to students,
whereas it formerly belonged to the
administration. At other universities,
Bunn pointed out, faculty members
read all copy before it went into the
campus newspapers; a contrast to the
Farm's liberal press policy.
Dean Yost, in her talk to the group,
explained how the administration
and the student government organi

zaliotis arc coordinated. She said that
the deans' offices attempted to pre
sent the long-range view to enthusi
astic student planners, who may not
realize the former experiments un

dertaken on the .same idea, or who
have not had the experience to re
alize the logical consequences of such
plans once put into effect.
Courtaney Perren, chairman of
Women's Council, discussed the
problem of educating students on the
Honor Code and on the social regu
lations. Suggestions were: (I) pub
lishing a booklet on the history of
the code, and (2) having a test for
all women students on the social
regulations.

sponsors should be educated in par
