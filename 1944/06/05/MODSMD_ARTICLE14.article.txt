### 
When the Home and Marriage
group holds its last meeting of the
quarter Wednesday at 4 p.m. in the
"Y" rooms, Mrs .Oscar Carlson will
be on hand to speak to all members
on the topic, "Living Without. Your
Husbands," according to Merriam
Margetts, chairman of the group.
Mrs. Carlson, whose husband is a
doctor in the service, has, in prepara
tion for this talk, conversed with
many of her friends who arc finding
it necessary, due to wartime circum
stances, to live without their hus
bands. Mrs. Carlson will try to point
out the things women can do under
such conditions, both to help them
selves and their husbands.
All women on campus are sin
cerely urged to come, as this, the last
group meeting, promises to be out
standing, and is particularly perti
nent to wartime, according to Miss
Margetts. Mrs. Rathbun, who has at
past meetings been in charge of the
speakers, and of coordination of
topics from week to week, will again
be 011 hand.
