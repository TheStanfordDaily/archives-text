# ALLIES MARCH THROUGH ROME
## Nazis Retreat; Leave City Virtually Intact 
### United Press 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, NAPLES, June 4 (UP).-Trium-
I phant Fifth Army troops tonight captured Rome, bringing libera
tion for the first time to a Nazi-enslaved European capital, and
; German rear guards were fleeing the Eternal City in disorganized
' retreat to the northwest.
Except for the rail yards, smashed by Allied bombs, the city
,is 95 per cent intact, Reynolds and Eleanor Packard of tho
: United Press reported after their arrival in the city with the
Allied occupation forces.
(The Berlin radio announced the evacuation of Rome and,
quoting an order from Adolf Hitler's headquarters, said German
troops had been directed to take up new positions to the north
west to avoid bringing the city under peril of destruction.)
Late tonight the British Eighth Army, rushing into Rome from
the southeast along the Via Casilina, was reported joining the
Fifth Army in close pursuit of the hard-pressed enemy remnants,
under orders to destroy them to a man if that were possible.
Only enough troops to maintain order and ferret out any
j (:erman snipers or suicide men were to be left in Rome as tho
main Allied armies pounded on without pausing to celebrate
their greatest triumph, coming 270 days after the start of the
Italian campaign.
At the very gates of Rome, the Germans had made a final
stand, but Lt. Gen. Mark W. Clark, after waiting three hours for
the enemy troops to withdraw in accordance with their own
avowal of Rome as an open city, ordered a violent anti-tank
barrage. Then masses of Fifth Army men and weapons crashed
into the city, and began mopping up enemy snipers and a few
tanks and mobile guns which were trying to cover the retreat.
Most of the enemy survivors of a 23-day Allied whirlwind
offensive were streaming in congested retreat to the northwest
at the mercy of Allied planes which during the day destroyed
or damaged 600 enemy trucks and other vehicles. The Germans'
jammed traffic columns stretched 55 miles to Lake Bolsena.
