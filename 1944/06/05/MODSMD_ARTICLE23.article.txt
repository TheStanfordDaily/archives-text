from-the-shouldcr frankness, Eric
Johnston, president of the U.S.

gulf separated the economies of the
United States and Russia, but that
bridges of practical cooperation could
eb thrown across it.
Johnston advocated extensive post
war trade and visits between Amer
ican business and "Soviet capitalists"
as one bridge, but said that "each of
our countries should be allowed to
pursue its own unique economic ex -
periment. unimpeded by the other."
Bluntly, he told the Soviets that
Americans "were most private mind
ed and most individual minded and,
make no mistake, we are determined
to remain so and even become so."

last week, was luncheon guest of A. I.
Mikoyan, Soviet Trade Commission
commissar at Spiridonovka House. At
