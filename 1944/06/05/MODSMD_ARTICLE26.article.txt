'I HIS is a surprise package. When Editor Cunha puts out
her hand for a copy of the Frosh Edition this morning, she'll
find one more of the "big babies," eight-column papers, that
have been scarce around the Daily Shack since the beginning of
ihe war.
As for this matter of the invasion, we tried to order it for
Sunday, June 4, but something slipped up. Instead we are lucky
to be able to report the good news concerning the fall of Rome.
Traditionally the frosh are forced to eject upperclassmen of
the Daily staff from the premises of the Shack with the aid of
waterbags. Traditionally the upperclassmen bribe the back shop
to print the edition on green paper. But whether or not this
Daily is on green, white, or polka-dotted paper, we the frosh
have enjoyed our turn at editing, and our ride in the Swivel
Chair. Nada Skidmore
