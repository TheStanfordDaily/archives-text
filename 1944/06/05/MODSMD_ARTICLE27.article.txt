# Once Upon a Farm
## 
### 
ONCE THERE WAS a little rumor. It did lots of traveling for
such a very little rumor. It was whispered behind tired "source
books" at the Civ Libe, it rustled along the Quad, and it even
went back to the folks at home stowed away in the pages of an
occasional letter.
Funny thing about that rumor. It had too many ugly words
in it words like "liquor on campus" and others that didn't seem
to correlate with Stanford's Fundamental Standard that "stu
dents are expected to show both within and without the Uni
versiy such respect for order, morality, personal order, and the
tights of others as is demanded of good citizens."
After a while an editorial appeared in The Daily about the
subject. That was back in Winter Quarter, and it was printed
there because some Stanford students were wondering why
nothing was being done about the content of the little rumor.
Now variations upon it have reached the freshmen. It's a
little disillusioning to discover that one of the essential parts of
the University's social regulations continues to be broken and
ttiat this action is being shrugged off by certain students. But
a blase attitude is often infectious; the obvious need for change
will have to be answered soon. Most of us who were new to
Stanford in '43 have heard the little rumor, most of us have
wondered how much truth it contained, and most of us have
discovered that it is much more important than the usual word
of mouth gossip.
An all-campus mass meeting, where the social policy will
be discussed, is scheduled for tonight in the auditorium of the
Education Building at 7:30. Perhaps this is the time for some
one to ask whether or not this part of Stanford's social regula
tions has occasionally remained just a phrase in the Frosh Bible,
and why this attitude has been given only passive and not active
consideration by some students, in the light of the responsibili
ties we take on with the Honor Code.
We don't want a bigger and farther-reaching rumor to say,

around to doing anything about it . . ."-—Nada Skidmore
