TODAY, the frosh are taking over the Daily Shack and at
the same time the right to speak in their edit columns about
their favorite subject—the Stanford Farm. The frosh have in
herited a new Farm —not the one that blared its name across
the sports pages in the days of Frankie Albert and the Rose
Bowl games; not the Farm that represented party times and big
name bands and frolics at the Palace. But we still hear about that
Farm, so we know a little of what it would be like.
Yes, we hear about that Farm day after day, from the chronic
grumblers, and the "playboys," and the others, who haven't
stopped to think. Their idea, it seems, is this: Stanford is just
marking time; just existing till the war is over when it can swing
painlessly back to the old times. The boys will come back, the
parties will begin again. Fun, huh?
In the first place, Stanford is not going to be the same: those
who are still trying to hold onto the old times should remember
that. In the second, we, the freshmen, like our Stanford as it
is ... be there fewer men, fewer parties, fewer football heroes.
As freshmen we entered a university that had an overwhelm
ing list of far-famed alumni. Stanford University —a place where
we could look on, while unknowable BMOC's made Farm his
tory. It would've been great; we would've had fun; but it
v/ould've been a long time before those BMOC's would know
about us freshmen.
But today they know us. We've been invited to take over
jobs that are ordinarily reserved for upperclassmen. We've met
and played and worked with those BMOC's. It hasn't been "gay"
fun all the time; but it's been serious, level-headed, feet-planted
on-the ground fun.
Today there's a place for all of us upper and lower class
men, big and little people. We're all here with a purpose; it is
v/e who have created the new Stanford. And to those who still
hearken for the good old days, we say stop, think, and be
proud. Beth Mac Vicar.
