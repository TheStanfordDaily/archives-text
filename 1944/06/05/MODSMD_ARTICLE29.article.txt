BILL CONLEY'S Daily Biz Staff jes' grew last week. Eight or
nine freshman women walked into the Shack, put their books
on a sagging table and said, "We're here to stay. How are the
chances for a big paper?"
Since then another eight-column Daily has been published
and today the third is on the stands. In the Campus Opinion
column is a letter citing the writer's reasons for boosting the
larger sized paper concrete, realistic reasons which instigated
her comment.
All Bill -Conley's Biz Staff needs is Excommittee's approval
of a plan which will give him the authority to decide how often
the eight-column Daily can appear.
