### Mary Al Smith 
(iordy Davis has the Inner Quad, Tillson has Belt's, Tony has
the Women's Gym, and a frosh has the Civ Libe. For many years
the Civ Libe has been the traditional home of the Stanford
freshman. Tourists have been known to furnish first-guarter
gals with these detailed directions to Room 203. Enter 202 by
filing lock and tiptoe past Independent bridge game. Here na
ture lovers may pause to study leaf formation as found in the
species orangus grovus from the genus of the same name. Here
bird lovers may find enjoyment in the serenade of the tenor
tanager. Here book lovers may want to dust books. Here lovers
may like to —but you know the rules. Anyway, the Cellar isn't
open till 3:30.
Civ Communique
But—and this will come as a surprise to you —but—get a
grip on your nerves—but —we think you can take it—but we are
informed by an official communique from central offices that—
are you ready?—that —take a deep breath —deeper—that
freshmen no longer crowd the Civ Libe. No more do they find
relaxation in discussing the varied tones of the tanager; no more
do they compare cotyledons of the orangus grovus; no more—
What can explain the disappearance of the D.A.R.'s? Mr. An- !
tnony, well-known lover of problems and author of the famous
book, "Why I Left Skinneatelis to Roam the North Woods,"
believes that the freshmen must have discovered the elusive
Bender Room and are continuing their Civ activities within its
stalls.
Through the Keyhole
The following conversation between two seventh-quarter
frosh was overheard by the Daily wild-life reporter. By way of
explication, their complicated lingo refers to their length of
absence from Room 203 in the History building.
"How long has it been?"
"Ten."
"Twenty."
"Thirty."
"Forty."
"Fifty."
"A helluva long time."
A few weeks ago the problem of the empty Civ Libe was j
brought to the attention of an ingenious frosh engineer who has I
just completed plans for the Libe of the future which will be char-!
acterized by an atmosphere of informality and Philip Morris, i
During finals freshman class officers will install the long-awaited
blueprint in a coveted corner of the campus. The exact location
of the pearl-studded plan is now in the rumor stage, but it is
the firm belief of BMOC (Bird Man on Campus) Benny Blotz that |
the blueprint will come to lie next the famed Stanford Axe in
the Cellar. Bird Man Blotz also announced that "Quad clothes
will be worn at the installation."
Pome
A future Branner Woman on Campus has put the implica- 1
tions of the new plan into verse:
"Move the Civ Libe to the highway
Near that pleasant little byway;
Fut cartoons in every source book,
Wear a smile to tame that coarse look,
And cancel all the fines that we should pay."
According to B. J. L. S. M. F. T. Yukyuk, head of the Com
mittee of 17, the new Civ Libe will be stuffed with red plush over
stuffed chairs for overstuffed freshmen. Light green Venetian
blinds will grace the spotless windows. The long tables and ants
will be replaced by roulette wheels and king-size ash trays. A
music listening room, complete with radios and recordings of
the immortal words of Marx, Aquinas, and Mr. Phillips—that's
Mr. Cleveland Phillips—will be annexed to the air-conditioned,
Persian-rugged study room.
Jordan Hall has its protozoa, Lagunita Lake has its pollywogs,
the Golf Course has its gophers, and the Civ Libe, due to the
energetic, ingenious, studious but nice—students, still has its
freshmen.
