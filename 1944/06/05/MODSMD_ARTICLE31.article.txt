To the Editor:
Last Friday the Daily staff published a paper of which they
can be proud. It was an example of good journalism which is
worthy of Stanford.
Why not go back to the full-sized paper? Certainly it is
evident that it is more pleasing in itself. More news and more
pictures can be published. The old full-sized paper is better
journalism and gives those working on the paper more expe
rience in their field.
The Daily # was cut down to the tabloid size almost two years
ago because of financial reasons. Today Bill Conley, business
manager, has figures which prove the cutting of the paper to
tabloid size is no longer necessary. A large paper would cost
a little less than a tabloid.
By publishing a larger paper the Daily can sell more ads
which will make it financially better off. The paper shortage is
110 excuse. A four-page large size takes the same amount of
paper as an eight-page tabloid which the Daily freguently pub
lishes.
A letter from Ramsey S. Oppenheim, general manager of
Western advertising, complimented the Daily staff:
"Your old-style issue of May 18 looked very good. Tell the
editor it reminded me of better days."
When Ex Committee reviews the reguest of the Daily for a
four-page large paper let them take these points into considera
tion. Let's return to the better days hopeftilly,
Betty Tremayne
