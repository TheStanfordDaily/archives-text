HEDFORD VILLAGE, by Hervey
Allen. (Farrar and Rinehart.) You
lak your stories fulla da words?
Hervey Allen's verbose, 38lh century
style wanders through 305 pages of
historical fiction in "Bedford Village."
This new book is the sequel to
"The Forest and the Fort" and the
forerunner of four more novels
which Mr. Allen plans to combine in
two volumes entitled "The Disin
herited," a new high in contemporary
ambition if he makes it. Our bet is
lhat he'll need plenty of hot coffee
and the evil weed to watch him
through the long, smothering nights
lie will spend deep in data, data,
data.
Salathiel Albine, eat ly American
i reared by Shawnee Indians, is the
central character of "Bedford Vil—
! lage," and Mr. Allen winds his talents
I as a story-teller around Salathiel's
! first contacts with "civilization," a
j frontier settlement of 17G4. He
I patches together the lives of several
frontier men and women into a novel
that is easy to read with the radio
i turned on, despite the fact that his
rambling paragraphs are like a
I crazy-quilt. . . . bright, jumbled, and
i sewn together with a firm hand.
No sensationalist, the author has
the facts handy and the will to pre
; sent them in a comprehensive, fic
j tional outline of American history.
No sensationalist either, this reporter
I doubt whether Mr. Allen has the
! acuteness needed for success.
"Bedford Village" is a pleasant
I attempt, but 305 pages of Allen is a
I starchy enough diet. His dream of
j the two - volume "Disinherited"
| sounds like possible literary indi
gestion.—Skidmore
