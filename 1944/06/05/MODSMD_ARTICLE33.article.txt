SIIINE ON HARVEST MOON Now
playing at the Stanford Theater,
with Ann Sheridan and Dennis
Morgan.
"Shine on Harvest Moon," starring
The Ann Sheridan, is a beautiful
character study of Miss Sheridan!
She is billed in one of her acts as the
sweet seductive songstress and from
sequin gowns to high plumes Miss
Sheridan fits the role, if you like
sort of stufT and can stand to sit
through hours of her throaty songs
and hot love scenes with the smooth
Dennis Morgan.
Miss Sheridan starts the show
moving by clawing one of her ad
mirers across the face. He decides to
get even with her and so buys up all
the show houses (this is vaudeville)
and puts her on the blacklist.
Morgan Sings 'Em
In the meantime Dennis Morgan
and our heroine of the strapless
gowns sing songs (which Morgan
writes) and live in a small flat on
graham crackers. The torrid action
of our two principal actors is relieved
by the riotous Jack Carson who
would have really impressed Stan
ford's Hyer (his magic is impossible
but helps the action of the play out
immensely).
Well, as the plot thickens (who is
kidding who) Miss Sheridan decides
to give up Morgan to a girl who has
always wanted him as a partner in a
singing vaudeville act. Morgan, how
ever, can't see it, so he goes on sing
ing in one-horse operas and writing
songs.
Finale in Color
The movie switches from black and
white to color in the last scenes ol
the finale, "Shine on Harvest Moon,"
which Morgan has written. The pho
tography was nothing exceptional,
but the musical sequences were well
staged.
The best thing about the whole
program was a short on "Buy War
Bonds." Frank Sinatra sang and
everyone went wild.—Quinn
