### BILL ADAMS 
With the Stanford intramural base
ball season now a thing of the past,
we look back over the records to see
which names stand out among the
rank and file of participants. We find
innumerable players worthy of merit
for one reason or another. The team
listed below consists of the players
who, according to the general con
sensus, were exceptional in their
given positions.

rison, Hayes.

Tyler.
Pitts, probably the best pitcher in
the league, pitched two nohitters for
the Firehouse, striking 10 or over in
almost every game. For the second
pitcher, it was a toss-up between
Morrison and Slier, with the former
rating a slight edge with us because
of his tricky "stuff."
Both Martzlofl' and Martmann rate
mainly because of their excellent
fielding in a difficult position.
Luce showed power at the plate for

Monroe, Moore and Ashley were ex
cellent all-around players, and Ca
sella handled himself as smoothley
as a veteran at the hot corner. The
four outfielders, Clague, Haines,
Reische, and Seeley, were all noted
for their exceptional fielding and
throwing. All were fair hitters.
