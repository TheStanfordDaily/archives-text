# Campus Quiz Will Feature Intellectuals
## 
### 
Beginning today, campus intellec
tuals will have their chance to con
tribute questions to stump the ex
perts in the "Axe Me Another"' quiz
show being initiated this Friday. The
green boxes, used currently for the
A.S.S.U. elections, will be distributed
to various points on Quad, labeled
with "Axe Me Another," and wait
ing to be filled with students' ques
tions. A prize will be supplied by
Cardinals for the best question.
Questions should be written plain
ly on a slip of paper and dropped into
the boxes, complete with the correct
answers, sometime during the week.
Questions will be segregated by
Claire Kestcr, who is in charge of
this department. There are practi
cally unlimited possibilities for ques
tions, according to Charley Clark,
Cardinal member, and general chair
man of the event.
Emcee Shcr
Stanford's first presentation of the
show will be held in Frost Amphi
theater from (5:45 to 8 p.m. next Fri
day, according to Clark. Emcee Joe
Slier will pop questions at the two
teamsâ€”one made up of four well
known faculty members, the other of
four outstanding Farm students. Both
men and women will participate on
each team.
Cardinals, who are sponsoring the
event, will be on hand to usher Fri
day evening and arc supplying prizes
to the teams, win or lose. Competi
tion will be judged by a board of
four, selected by Dick Jobe.
Throughout the contest, a running
score will be kept on a blackboard,
whereby students can sec how their
teams are faring.
A.A.U.W. Activities
The purpose of the show, according
to Clark, is to provide a greater va
riety of on-campus functions and to
foster more activities in the amphi
theater. The idea is new to college
campuses, and if successful, could
become a novel tradition at the Farm,
Clark commented.
There will be an important meet
ing of the committee heads in the Ex
com room on Tuesday at 4:30, to
which all are required to come.
