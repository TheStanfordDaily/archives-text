(he women is forthcoming tonight
when the male Buchanan Bearcats
tangle.with the Lagunita All-Stars in
a baseball fight to the finish on the
sunken diamond at 7:15,
The 'Bearcats, who dwell in the
cellar of the regular intramural
league during the entire season, and
emerged without a single win, are
attempting to avenge themselves by
defeating the best that the women
can offer. From reports received, this
will be none too poor, as the Lagunita
pitcher, "Wyoming" Atkinson, was
once women's champion softball
pitcher of the state after which she is
called.
Probable pitcher for the Bearcats
will be Don McKellar, whose speed
the Buchanan boys are banking on to
overcome the hypothetically slow
swinging women. Opinions as to the
outcome of the game are many and
varied, the general consensus being
that, the Bearcats will continue their
consistent losing ways.
