# Moliere Play Has High Wit, Lilting Music
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
Lavishness and opulence combined
with an atmosphere of gay comedy
and wit i.s the keynote of the Stan
ford Players' production of Moliere's
"The School for Husbands," to be
presented in the Memorial Theater
on June 8, 9, and 10.
The play, which takes place in the
Paris ol 1661, concerns the trials and
tribulations of two older brothers,
Sganarelle (Professor Philip Buck)
and Ariste (Dr. B. Q. Morgan), with
their young wards, Isubelle (Candy
Taylor) and Leonore (Dorothy Mer
rill).
Their ideas differ on how to bring
up the two girls, Sganarelle thinking
that they should be kept locked up
and not allowed to go out or to see
young men; and Ariste holding the
opinion that the young ladies should
have their own way and be allowed
to do as they 'please. The ending
proves that the latter's theory reaps
rewards, because Leonore marries
Ariste, her guardian, while Isabelle
runs away with her dancing master.
"Spring Show of 1 <><Â» 1"
The play is what one might expect
of a "Spring Show of 1661," according
to F. Cowles Strickland, director, and
features songs and dances by both
major and minor characters, together
with a very brilliant and witty
rhymed dialogue.
Because the original musical score
for the play was lost long ago, old
French folk songs of (he time have
been adapted for the musical inter
polations. Although listeners may not
know the words of some of the songs,
they will undoubtedly recognize the
melodies from such tunes as
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," "Au
Clair De La Lune," and "Plaisir
D'Amour," among many others.
Music Backs Up Dialogue
The music is light and dainty, and
helps to enhance the already gay
and lilting atmosphere of the play.
A small chamber orchestra, typical
of the times, will provide the music
under the direction of Dr. Jan Pop
per; it is composed of four strings
and four woodwinds: a piano, two
violins, a cello, an oboe, a flute, a
bassoon, and a clarinet.
Tickets for Thursday, Friday, or
Saturday's performances are on
sale for 90 cents at the box office of
the Memorial Theater; or they may
be reserved by calling P.A. 2-2041.
