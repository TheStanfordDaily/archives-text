# Chaparral's D-Day Revealedâ€” Mag Will Appear Wednesday
## 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
Up in Hyer's room, your "favrut"
Daily reporter was informed that the
spring quarter Chappie will be ap
pearing on campus next Wednesday.
Chuck full of humah, this issue will
feature stories by Farm notables
such as Rene Zentner, Barney Gugel,
and Henrietta Nussbaum.
Miss Nussbaum, who is not only
one of the outstanding journalists of
Farm literary circles but promises to
become one of the better humorists
of the campus, has produced a Now
That Date column and an entirely
original joke for the forthcoming
Chappie. (My sister, Agatha Nuss
baum, is also talented.)
The noted English pulp magazine
writer, Sir Thomas, T. Thomas-
Thomas has condescended to write
for America's leading pulp magazine,
the Chappie, and this month has con
tributed a beaut entitled "Jurnleigh's
Jurneigh."
The cover, which features the use
of gold ink, was done by Ed Mc-
Lellan, Plans were being made for
the original to be hung in the De
Young Museum of San Francisco, but
McLellan has modestly declined.
Editor Hyer, still mumbling in his
beard about the defeat of the Farm
mag at the hands of the Farm rag in
last Friday's baseball tourney, smiled
benificently as he announced that
the Chappie will appear at the new
low price of 25 cents. Hooray, kid
dies.
Drawings by Dick Fayram will be
featured in a center spread, and will
adorn other pages throughout the
issue. Original pomes and a sensa
tional new story by Barney Gugel
will doubtless astound the campus
with the type of humor seen daily in
the Farm's leading newspaper.
Gugel said, 'The Chappie will
scoop every other mag in the United
States and will present an issue that
is the first of its kind ever to appear."
When we asked him about the theme,
Gugel replied with maniacal laughter
and a confidential "wait'n see."
To skeptics, we say:

Did you know that the Chappie
ranks among the top three college
humor magazines of the country?
'Sa fact.
