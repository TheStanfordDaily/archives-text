## 
### DOROTHY CHIN 
Mrs. Helene M. Heymans, lecturer
in the Dutch language, is leaving
Stanford Friday, June 9 for the
Netherlands-Indies Women's Corps.
"I regret leaving Stanford and espe
cially my boys (all AST students),
but I feel that joining up is my duty,"
said Mrs. Heymans.
In October 1943 Mrs. Heymans be
came a member of the faculty here
at Stanford. Teaching was a new
experience for her. She is very
grateful of the kindness and help
given her by Dead Dodds and the
department and especially for the
understanding help and marvelous
cooperation given her by her as
sistants and collaborators.
"Stanford's Beautiful"
"Stanford is beautiful. The stu
dents are very privileged and fortu
nate to have all the wonderful facili
ties. It has been a pleasure to teach
the boys, who are 'swell' and very
intelligent."
In whatever free time Mrs. Hey
mans has now, her boys are giving
her some pointers on army life. Mrs.
Heymans has already learned some
army expressions from them.
Reports to Geortria
She will report to Fort Oglethorpe,
Georgia on June 16 for her basic
training. When the group completes
this training in August they will be
sent to Australia.
Mrs. Heymans urges all American
women to do their job by joining the
WAC. She thinks that the WAC is
doing a marvelous job, and the wom
en who are free should join. Upon
her arrival in the United States, Mrs.
Heymans had intended to join the
WAC, but could not, because she
wasn't a citizen.
"I'm sorry to leave my boys and
my friends at Stanford. Everyone
has been so nice to me. I hope that
I shall be able to come back," said
Mrs. Heymans.
