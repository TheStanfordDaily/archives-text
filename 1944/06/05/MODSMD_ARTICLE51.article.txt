"We live in two worlds: the world
of ideas and beauty, and the world
of war," said Mr. Obert C. Tanner in
the chapel service yesterday at the
Memorial Church.
There are three possible adjust
ments to this situation, Mr. Tanner
said. Men either turn their backs on
both worlds, or try to take just one
world at a time, or attempt to sus
tain the tension of having two an
tagonistic worlds at the same time.
The latter is what we need to do if
this civilization hopes to survive, Dr.
Tanner stated.
Some do not feel, he continued,
that this sustaining policy will, in
the long run, give a better world.
These people do not realize that
evil can go only so far, and that the
right, defeated, is stronger than evil,
victorious. "The years may lie, but
the centuries never," Mr. Tanner
stated.
