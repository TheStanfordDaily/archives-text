is today's reality!
Steel rails connecting coast
with coast! That was Abraham
Lincoln's vision, realized by
the Driving of the Golden
Spike. This historic event, in
] 869, united the first trans
continental t racks, and initiated
the nation-wide delivery by Ex
press of commercial goods and
personal packages at passenger
train speed.
Today, Railway Express
operates on 230,000 miles of
track. Over them daily, 10,000
trains speed shipments of every
kind to and from 23,000 offices.
Included in this nation-wide
network is almost every college
town in America. Generations
of students lirst learned about
Express Service when they left
home for college, then grew to
depend upon it during their
years on the campus.
When you do have packages
to send, you can help us do our
war job better by aiding in
three ways: Pack your ship
ments securely —address them
clearly— start them early. Our
century of experience proves
that "a shipment started right
is half-way there!"
