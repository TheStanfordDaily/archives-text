There is no cream like beautifying face cream.
Unique among all the many beauty aids, this fine
preparation by Harriet hubbard aylr awakens in
the skin a roseate bloom ... a look of fresh clarity.
Use it at night to revive radianceâ€”use it by day for a
luminous, petal-quality . . . and you will look
your loveliest through the years.
