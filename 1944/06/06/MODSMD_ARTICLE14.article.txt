### 
Stanford's first quiz show, "Axe
Me Another," is being organized
quickly for its initial presentation
Friday night in the Frost Amphi
theater, from 6:45 till 8.
Two teams will participate in the
quiz show and will consist of four
outstanding students who will vie
against a team of four noted Farm
faculty members.
Included among the contestants,
announced Mary Lou Patten, are:
Professors Max Savelle, Herbert
| Merritt, and Georges Lomaitre, who
| will compete against Irma Cunha, J.
i D. Williams, and Dick Driscoll.
Posters up on Quad today were
drawn by Bobbie Upshaw and her
i poster committee.

| Questions for the quiz are to be
contributed by Farm students. Green
boxes have been distributed on Quad,
so that inspired intellects may con
| tribute whatever comes to their
j minds.
Clark suggested a question such as
'What is the longest word you can
i think of?", to be answered within a
j specified time. Students may use
their own judgment and ingenuity in
deciding what questions would be
suitable.
i In contributing a question, students
. should write it with the answer and
their name, so that when prize
delivering-time comes around, the
I donor of the best question will re
ceive the prize lie earned.
