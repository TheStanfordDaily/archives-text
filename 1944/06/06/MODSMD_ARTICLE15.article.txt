# Students Argue Social Problems
## 
### DAVE DAVIS 
In Ins introductory remarks, Chairman Harry Rathbun emphasized the
most important lesson to he learned at last night's mass meeting on social
policy: that Stanford well deserves the reputation it has earned of a demo
cratic student government. Nearly 5110 Farm students, representing every
phase of Stanford life, gathered last night to help thrash out (1) what are

the purposes of a social policy? (2)
a definition of the terms involved in
the question: function, private party
as opposed to a group party, off-cam -
pus; (.'}) how is the liquor problem
connected with the social policy? (4)
I what type of social policy is most
effective to meet Stanford's prob
-1 lem?
A.S.S.U. President Dick Driscoll
spoke first as a member of the panel
gathered to provide information and
background to the above mentioned
questions. He pointed out that pre
war social regulations were confined
to off-campus dances, and that no j
liquor could be served on the prem
ises.
Dean Yost and War I
Driscoll was followed by Dean of I
Women Mary Yost who explained
the social conditions after the last
war, in the period of prohibition, and â€¢
stressed the unseen facts that led to
greater problems of drinking, of good
conduct, and conduct involving
younger members of the student
body.
Dean Bunn added to Miss Yost's
discussion with his interpretation of
the purposes of a social policy, un
derscoring Miss Yost's earlier state
ment that a social or recreational
program was designed primarily to
do just that: that is, re-create, re
fresh the spirits, minds, and bodies of
the students so that they might with
greater efficiency fulfill the academic
standards of the University. Mr.
Bunn added that the purpose of com
ing to college was to study, and that
a social program which detracted
from that purpose by reducing the
efficiency of the students, their moral
codes, was not in the spirit of Stan
ford.
Panel members then developed the
formal beginning into an informal
discussion of the other questions al
ready mentioned, Courtaney Perren
and Marion Neilsen, Jim Reynolds,
J. D. Williams, and Luana Forkner
brought out rules and regulations j
dealing with the enforcement of so
cial programs by Excom. Men and
Women's councils are concerned with
violations of the Fundamental Stand
lations of it in respect to drunken
latio nosf it in respect to drunken
ness.
Drinking and Conduct
The question of liquor was a point j
of controversy, for panel members !
split in the discussion of extremes: |
unrestrained drinking with an ac
cent on moderation; no drinking at
all, in view of the physiological and

moral effects of alcohol.
J. D. Williams, Excom, asked that
the panel be realistic, that "Stanford
students do drink, have drunk, and
will drink." Panel members then
argued from not only personal points
of view in respect to drinking, but
from facts such as state regulations,
automobile accidents due to drinking,
and moral problems involved in
drinking.
The panel discussion was closed
when Chairman Rathbun threw the
meeting open to questions from the
j floor.
Open Forum
Students who spoke, in the rna
' jority, showed the necessity for a
I further study of the entire question
of a social program. The questions
from the floor indicated a doubt of
the statements of panel members
rather than a sincere attempt to aid
Excom in the formulation of a new
policy. Many speakers, on the other
hand, evidenced a desire to help
Excom and the University toward a
greater understanding of the war
time problems involved in off-cam
pus activity by individuals, by
groups, which involved not only
drinking, dancing, but general social
codnuct.
The discussion from the floor was
still in progress at Daily press time,
and a furtherr eport of opinions ex
pressed and decisions to be made will
appear in a later edition.
