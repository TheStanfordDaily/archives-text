# Tryouts for War Board, 1-4 Today
## 
### 
All students who are interested in
working on the War Board summer
quarter should come to the War
Board office between 1 and 4 this
afternoon, according to Patty Patten,
chairman. If this assigned time is
inconvenient for anyone wishing to
try out, they should phone Miss
Patten at 22151.
Positions are available to Upper
and Lower Division men and women,
qualifications being a desire to aid
the war effort and an interest in stu
dent activities.
"We feel that everyone interested
in working on the War Board should
be contacted before appointments are
made," Miss Patten said. "In this
way we will be able to spread posi
tions through a wider proportion of
the student body and be able to
choose persons best qualified for the
work.
"We are very anxious to have
freshmen as well as upper classmen
working on the War Board, so if you
are interested, be sure to come over
this afternoon."
