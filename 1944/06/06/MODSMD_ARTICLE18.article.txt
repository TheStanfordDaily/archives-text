According to old Old Boy Hyer, the
big news of the week is that the
Chappie is still going to come out.
Things looked black, though, when
the printing was held up by the con
vulsions of the print shop boys as
they read the mag's material.
There will be a meeting of all con
tributors in the Chappie Den at 7
p.m. next Sunday, according to Hyer.
A subscription drive will be held
at the end of this week for the sum
mer Chappie. No, you don't have to
come back to school summer quarter
to get a Chappie any more, said
Hyer. Just sign your name, give
with the coin, and your magazine will
be delivered to you via the mails.
