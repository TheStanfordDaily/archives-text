# Where's Hildegarde? What Has She Got?
## 
### MARIAN MORROW 
Have you seen Hildegarde?
That moan around campus lately is
from the Stanford women. They
have just found out the truth about
the boys at Encina. What, the Stan
ford women want to know, what does
Hildegarde have that Stanford wom
en don't have?
It is not enougli that Hildegarde is
allowed in territory absolutely un
known to every other gal—she is
given free rein over all Encina—no,
she is also given first preference in
| all matters of importance.
Good Laundress
Merely because Hildegarde does
the laundry so beautifully — but
therein lies the story. Hildegarde, it
seems, was found huddled beside the
road one dark and stormy night sev
eral years ago. She was found by an
upstanding young fellow who took a
friendly interest in her, and who of
fered to help her get on the right
road again. She was an orphan, a
poor girl who had gotten on the
wrong way of life.
Diek, the young man in question,
had a long talk with her, and when
he went away to college, offered to
take her with him, providing she
would live quietly in his closet, cause
no trouble, and do the laundry of
the fraternity house with finesse. She,
poor girl, was thrilled. Here was her
opportunity to prove herself.
Even Enrolled in Classes
She made such rapid improvement
in her character that soon she even
took a few college courses: simple
things like "How to Set a Clock
Without Hands" and"The Policy of
Fixing a Shoestring After It's Been
Broken." She was a friendly little
soul and did the washing so well
that soon all the college was quite
mad about Hildegarde.

When Dick went in the Army he
couldn't leave poor Hildegardc-who
was-just-making-good behind, so,
upon her sincere promise that she
would leave the men alone, he took
her along in his barracks bag. And
there she lived happily ever after.
Ever after, that is, until Dick came
to Stanford.
Goes Wild on the Farm
There must be something about
this Stanford air, because ever since
Hildegarde came to Stanford she has
been simply unmanageable. It may
be she is still grieving about her
thwarted love affair with the Stan
ford rough who didn't reciprocate her
affections, but, nevertheless, all of
Dick's labor seems lost.
The laundry is always at least a
week late, and is very messy anyway.
She won't stay in the barracks bag —
all she wants to do is just wander up
and down the halls of Encina. She
bothers the poor boys when they're
busy studying and certainly don't
want any women around. As a mat
ter of fact, at the present moment,
Dick is offering her to anyone that
will have her: he has given her up
as a bad job.
It looks as if Hildegarde is always
on the boys' minds. About the only
consolation the Stanford women have
is that she is only a myth—Myth
Hildegarde.
