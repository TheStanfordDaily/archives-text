### 
NAPLES, June 5 (UP) â€” King
Victor Emmanuel of Italy today
signed over his royal powers to
Crown Prince Humbert as lieutenant
general of the realm, carrying out his
pledge to allied officials that he
would give up the royal authority he
has held for nearly 44 years when
allied troops liberated Rome.
The king did not abdicate his
throne. A formal statement said that
he had turned over all his powers
"without exception" to Humbert, who
would hold them "irrevocably" as
| long as he lives but that Victor Em

I and head of the house of Savoy.
