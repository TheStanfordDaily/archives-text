YESTERDAY'S DAILY must have shamed every
upper class member of the staff who has ever
complained about the time and energy spent
at the Shack. It wasn't only a large paper (the
result of close cooperation with members of the
business staff), but it was also a good paper,
not only from the public point of view but also
from the journalistic angle.
We older members of the staff weren't al
lowed to get near the Shack. But we did hear
about what went on. We heard each frosh
worked like a beaver, they had a good time,
and that never before had the Daily staff worked
so completely as a unit. Volume 107 will see
them in the drivers' seats and so it promises to
be one of the best.
