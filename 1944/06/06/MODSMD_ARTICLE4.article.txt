Congratulations to you and your able staff on
your really good "frosh edition."
We Daily members who were water-bagged

for word with a critical eye. Yes, we were look
ing for all kinds of mistakes—proof errors, bad
make-up, poor leads and heads, even a fake

was traditional.
But no, instead the "frosh edition" was some
thing the Daily can be proud of. How bright
the Daily's future looks with so many journal
istically talented frosh on the staff!—G.B.
