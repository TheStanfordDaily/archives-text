REVIEWIN' THE RECORDS
The "It's One oi Those Sultry Days and I Got
Classes and Labs and Stuff" Blues—Brewbird
record 5171, played by Sabu Shapiro and his
Oboe and his Oboe Hoboes, with the "Some of
Those Rooms at Branner Sure Aren't Going to
Look the Same Blues" on the other side.
If you like a good hot oboe, The "It's One of
Those Sultry Days and I dot Classes and Labs
and Stuff" Blues will be a prize item in your col
lection. Some swing authorities claim that Sabu

hits a high E flat instead of an E in the second !
chorus, but this reviewer has never yet noticed
it. The record has been so popular that oboe
fans all over the country have been flooding
Sabu with letters asking for his used oboe reeds
as souvenirs. Sabu, noted for his guiclc and
ready v/it, always writes back that he saves the
used reeds and uses them as toothpicks. (As a
matter of fact, he splits them in two and sells
them as clarinet reeds in his brother's store.)
Sabu Shapiro, it will be remembered, became
famous overnight with his smash hit, The John
and Mary Blues."

It Doesn't Make Us Happy When You Ask About \
The Chappie Blatztor record, 3.2, sung by the !
Hammer and Coffin Quintet, with Everybody's !
Nuts About the Daily on the other side.
Here's a goody! The Hand C Quintet, just
finished with a smash engagement at John's
Health Food Habitat, sing the two songs in the
style of the old Russian Madrigal. The articula- j
tion is incoherent in spots, but that is probably
due to an imperfection in the recording. This
waxing is expected to sell out in 24 hours.
