# Views on Your War

WHEN HITLER conceived the Festung Europa
he made one serious error—he left off the roof.
While we haven't taken complete advantage of
the situation—an amazing development came
through Sunday afternoon to point out the trend.
CBS Moscow Correspondent Jim Fleming in
terviewed two Flying Fortress pilots who had
just recently returned from a raid over eastern
Germany. The raid began and finished on an
American bomber base in the Soviet Union.
This means only one thing —which in itself
carries serious implications for the future. We
are striking at the Nazis from three sides. With
the tremendous power the Britain-based Eighth
Air Force, the sting of the Ninth Air Force in
the Mediterranean striking fr'om the weak un
derside, we now have a group of the 15th Air
Force that is Russia-based. More and more we
are driving the Germans back to their own soil
bombing every inch of the way.
If bombing is carried out extensively from
the east —as it certainly appears that it may
now—the complete areas of southeastern Ger
many as well as that of the old Polish corridor
and all the areas east of Berlin will be exposed
to allied bombing.
Examine the possibilities this new three-sided
bombing technigue presents.
The whole of western Europe is constantly
being softened up by the Eighth Air Force.
Willie Messerschmidt and his industrial cohorts
in Austria are being hammered by combined
units of the Eighth and Ninth air forces. While
the Italian campaign has absorbed a lot of the
power of the Ninth Air Force for the last few
months, their attention will now be turned to
blocking the German retreat and bombing the
supply columns and factories behind the Ger
man lines in northern Italy and Austria.
A U.P. dispatch from London—and CBS Mos
cow correspondent Fleming backs it up —says
a wave of panic is spreading throughout south
eastern Europe and eastern Germany as the re
sult of the recent shuttle bombing undertaken
by the Russia-based 15th Air Force group.
How large this air force is, how much we can
depend on it, how often they will bomb aftd
how effective they're going to be are guestions
only the Army knows. Soon, however, we will
know the results.

Aside from the war, bouquets to the freshman
staff of the Stanford Daily who edited and com
pletely handled the intricacies of yesterday's
paper. It was one of the finest editions of a
college paper we have seen and read. Since
most of those concerned with the paper were
women, we should be doubly proud that they
did such a competent job. Remember, these
people are on the job constantly, but yesterday
was their one big day. Bouquets to Nada Skid
more and her staff.
