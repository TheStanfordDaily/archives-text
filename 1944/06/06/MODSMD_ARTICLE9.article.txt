### 
Another poetry contest, the Ina Coolbrith Memorial Prize, is open to
Stanford undergraduates this month. This annual competition is offered
by the University of California, which has invited six other colleges and
universities, including Stanford, to participate.
Rules regarding entry and arrangements of manuscripts may be obtained

from the secretary of (he English de
; partment, Room 45. Entries must be
turned in before June 12.
Three poems will be selected from
each school and will then be submit
ted to the judge to be chosen by the
Committee on Prizes of the Univer
sity of California, the award to be
made to the best one of the 21.
A Stanford girl, Ann Louise Bow
man, shared last year's award with
a student of U.C. If in any year it
is the opinion of the judge that none
of the poems submitted have sufli
cient merit to justify the award of
the prize, the income for that year
shall be added to the principal of the
fund.
Ina Coolbrith, for whom the prize
is a memorial, is the former poet
laureate of California.
