SUPREME 11.0., A.E.F., (Somewhere in Great
Britain), Wednesday, June 7 (UP) —American,
Canadian, and British troops, landing on the
French Normandy coast to open the Western Front,
fought their way inland nine and one-half miles t€>
ancient Caen within a few hours yesterday and the
Germans reported that the gigantic allied invasion
operation was fast developing along a 60-mile
front.
Gen. Dwight 1). Eisenhower, after announcing
the invasion in one sentence in his first communi
que, said in a second one early today that the initial
landings had succeeded and that lighting con
tinued.
There had been no signs of a German counter
attack more than 24 hours after the opening of the
grand assault shortly before midnight Monday.

Apparently expecting a complete strategic and
tactical surprise by landing on a soft spot between
the heavily defended ports of Le Havre and Cher
bourg, the allied forces at remarkably low cost
made good their landings in the "great crusade"'
and fought their way into the streets of Caen. Ger
many reports that our forces also were astride the
Cherbourg-Valognes-Carentan road running along
| the east side of the Cherbourg Peninsula nearly 10
miles inland.
There also were German reports that the Allies
had seized an airdrome between Calais and Bou
logne np the coast on the Dover Strait and that a
landing force threatened the Calais-Dunkirk area
immediately to the east.
But the main attack, according to detailed Ger
man broadcast reports, was developing between
the month of the Orne river, in the Caen area, ami
the east side of the peninsula below Cherbourg.
The Germans reported that allied troops had
landed in the channel island of Guernsey and
Jersey off the west side of the Cherbourg peninsula.
