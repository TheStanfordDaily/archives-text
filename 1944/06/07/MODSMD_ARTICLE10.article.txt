WASHINGTON. June (5 (UP) —In solemn words that
went out to a newly hopeful world, President Roosevelt
tonight beseeched Almighty God lo give strength and
victory to allied invasion forces now launched upon the
greatest crusade of modern times—the emancipation of
Europe's suffering people.
'"Lead them straight and true," he supplicated. "They
will need Thy blessing. Their road will be long and
hard .... (but) we know that by Thy Grace, and by
the righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph."
Mr. Roosevelt composed the prayer last night as the
mighty allied invasion armada swung out across the
Channel and into France. It was heard by a radio
audience of perhaps 100,000.000 persons who had been
asked to recite it with him in this hour of national
triumph.
