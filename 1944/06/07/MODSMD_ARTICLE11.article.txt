With the Med School crowned as
champs in the Intramural Softball
League, and the Co. A ten rated as
tops among the soldiers, it's about
time for a play-off for the Farm title.
That the game would draw is evi
dent from the fact that the sports-
Istarved students of Stanford have
turned out in numbers for practically
anything, including the epic Daily vs.
Chappie brawl on the Sunken Dia
mond.
Original plans were to feature a
play-off for the civilian title before
the final tilt between soldiers and
civilians, but the Medics have dem
onstrated decisively that they rate
the civilian pennant without need of
a play-off.
Some afternoon next week would

be the best time, with the exact date
being decided on by the participants.
The much heralded brawl between
the Buchanan Bearcats and the La
gunita All-Stars has been postponed
to an indefinite date in the future
due to the Bearcats' difficulties in
rounding up a team. If and when
they meet, this should be the battle
of the century, with Buchanan, the
pride of the league, out for its first
and last win of the current season.
