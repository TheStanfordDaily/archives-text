# 'School for Husbands' Opens Tomorrow
## Lavish Costumes of Cavalier Period To Highlight Comedy 
### ELLEN MARCUS 
Mrs. Muriel Lievsay and her cos
tume classes are utilizing the ex
tra vagantness of the 17th century
Cavalier period in which "The School
for Husbands" takes place to make
the costumes for that production the
most lavish that Stanford theater
goers have seen since the advent of
"shortages."
The men of the Cavalier period
were almost as fussy about their
grooming as were the women. They
were insistent about the size of their
large lace collars and suffs and about
the shine of their high leather boots.
Beau Brummels wore large hats
with even larger plumes and deco
rated themselves with hooped rib
bons, buttons, and hand-made lace.
Sganarelle, the leading man of
The School for Husbands," played
by Professor Philip Buck, is the one
exception. He doesn't approve of the
frivolities of the age and is clothed
in cold and severe Puritan costumes.
iHs brother, Ariste, played by Dr.
B. Q. Morgan, however, is more
broadminded; and so is clothed in
the more bright and fancy fashions
if the day.
Valere, the young suitor of Sgan
arelle's ward, Isabelle, will be seen in
a beautiful black velvet suit which
boasts 15 dozen buttons and a large
white lace collar.
The women of this period were
gowned in dresses with very large
skirts but without the hoop skirts
that appeared in a later age. Their

sleeves were three-quarter length,
their necklines low, and they often
wore large wire whisk collars. The
coiffure of the day was with the hair
parted down the middle, bangs across
the forehead, and ringlets hanging
down in back.
As the mode was to have exceed
ingly fancy underskirts, their dresses
were often sift down the front ofc the
top skirt in order to reveal them.
Isabelle, the heroine of "The School
for Husbands," played by Candy
Taylor, will be seen in an aqua bro
cade dress with a dusty rose satin
frontpiece and visible underskirt.
The sleeves will also be inserted with
the rose satin.
Leonore, the ward of Ariste, who is
played by Dorothy Merrill, will wear
a gold brocade gown with a goltl bead
design decorating the neckline. Her
underskirt will be of wine satin. This
color combination will be carried out
in the costume of her guardian which
will be wine trimmed in gold.
The dancing master's costume,
however, is Mrs. Lievsay's pet as it
has huge sleeves of the very-hard
to-get gold wire net.
"The School for Husbands" will be
presented June 8, 9, and 10 in the
Memorial Auditorium. Tickets are
now available for 90 cents at the
box office of Memorial Hall or may
be reserved by calling P.A. 2-2041.
