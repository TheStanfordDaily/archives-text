# 'Man on a Farm Street' Interprets D-Day News
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Lights flashed on in houses and
halls on campus as the invasion news
spread like wildfire. Wild rejoicing
was the first reaction, then people
calmed down and began to think
more seriously.
What they thought was voiced at
the Cellar and on Quad, it was voiced
by students sitting on the libe steps
or waiting for the bus. Most of aW it
was voiced at the populous P.O.
There were happy faces, thoughtful
faces, and a few tear-stained ones,
but the general opinion was relief
that at last the news had broken and
the long strain of waiting was over.
"We stood on our right ears and
did flip flops," said Janice Shaugh
nessy. "It should be over in Ger
many now by September."
What About Future
"I'm glad it is on, of course," said
Holbrook Bonney, A.S.T.P. medical
student. But the political problems
of setting up proper governments in
the reconquered countries will be far
more difficult than the military con
quests. I would hate to think we
were just laying the groundwork for
another war in another 20 years."
"It's a wonderful thing," said Jaclc-
Peline Armstrong. "My family came
from France. Many of my relatives
are there still, several of military
age. We haven't heard from them
since June 1940. Perhaps now we
will have some news."
Clever Move
"It was a very clever place to at
tack," said Dr. Dayton Phillips. West
ern Civ instructor. "The British will
be fighting through Normandy, which
has always been under their influ
ence. and is almost a second England.
It is there that they Have won many
of their greatest victories—for ex
ample the battle of Crecy in 1346,"
he added with a twinkle in his eye.
"There was so much talk that I
was sure it wouldn't come this soon,"
was the opinion of Jordan Peckham,
who had just written an English

i paper on the subject. I think we
struck too soon. The Germans have
too much mobiilty on their inner
| supply and reinforcement roads. We
' should have waited for bad weather
to make those roads impassable.
j Third Front
"I don't think this attack on the
j ground is a second front at all, it. is
i the third front. The air invasion was
j the second front," said Vernon Walk
j er, sophomore.
When Professor Hubert HelTner
was asked for his opinion he replied
with, "I don't think public opinions
j are worth much, especially when it
j comes to such a tremendous matter
! as an invasion, which involves such a
complexity, hardly conceivable in
| its totality to even the experts them-
I selves.
"Rather than thrusting in our
j opinions," he continued, we should
trust our leaders; they are capable
men. That is the advantage of our
' democracy; we can be sure that our
! leaders rose by merit, not influence.
Son in I)

Mr. Rofi Cox, inter-departmental
mail carrier, felt the impact more
, than most. His son Bonner refused a
| deferment in 1943, and left Stanford
| to join the Ninth Army Signal Corps,
I Troop Carrier Wing. He was un
: doubtedly one of the first to para
chute down behind the enemy lines.
"It takes on a very serious aspect
: lor us with our son in it, but the in
vasion had to come, and I am certain
; ly proud of him." "We veterans of
the last war can take our son's ab
sence more philosophically than their
| mothers can," he added.
There was many a flippant remark
too, such as. "I refuse to talk until
I read Hayes Hunter" (anonymous),
: but underneath it all there was a
! grim determination, best summed up
; by Ivan Feng, graduate student. "We
all feel very humble about the in
j vasion. I think the best way for us
students to fulfill our role is by
1 working and studying all the harder."

Lights flashed on in houses and
halls on campus as the invasion news
spread like wildfire. Wild rejoicing
was the first reaction, then people
calmed down and began to think
more seriously.
What they thought was voiced at
the Cellar and on Quad, it was voiced
by students sitting on the libe steps
or waiting for the bus. Most of aW it
was voiced at the populous P.O.
There were happy faces, thoughtful
faces, and a few tear-stained ones,
but the general opinion was relief
that at last the news had broken and
the long strain of waiting was over.
"We stood on our right ears and

What About Future
"I'm glad it is on, of course," said
Holbrook Bonney, A.S.T.P. medical
student. But the political problems
of setting up proper governments in
the reconquered countries will be far
more difficult than the military con
quests. I would hate to think we

another war in another 20 years."
"It's a wonderful thing," said Jaclc-
Peline Armstrong. "My family came

will have some news."

"It was a very clever place to at

of their greatest victories—for ex

he added with a twinkle in his eye.
"There was so much talk that I
was sure it wouldn't come this soon,"
was the opinion of Jordan Peckham,
who had just written an English

struck too soon. The Germans have
too much mobiilty on their inner
