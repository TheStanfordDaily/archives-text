# Chappie on Quad Today
## 
### 
Those broad grins and loud laughs
seen on Quad today announce the
appearance of the spring - quarter

Chappie on the
stands. At last the
secret theme is out
— the theme that
kept Hyer and the
little Chappies
grinning content
edly through base
ball defeats, wa
ter bags, and D-
Days.
The cover, Ed

MeLellan's color
ful masterpiece, is

a dead giveaway to the theme, but
in case the readers are in a dull
mood they are urged to turn to the
gem by Guest Journalist Sir Thomas
T. Thomas-Thomas .... the one
about Jurnleigh's Jurniegh.
Daily readers are doubtless won
dering where they can get one of
these folders of fun. The answer
comes in a direct quote from our
man. the Old Boy, Bill Hyer himself.
"Timed to the invasion, the Chap
pie will appear today at 9 o'clock, at
the P.O. and the English corner —
and there'll be a special booth at
the Chemistry building to take care
of the gripes that accumulated after
the previous issue. Oh yes, and Stan
ford's little roughs will be glad to
hear that it only costs 25 cents this
time. Yes, only 25 cents."
