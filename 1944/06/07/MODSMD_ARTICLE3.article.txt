The war has brought no funda
mental changes in the American
party system, concluded Thomas S.
Barclay, professor of political science,
as he reviewed parties, politics and
politicians in relation to the forth
coming presidential campaign at last
night's Tuesday Evening Series.
j Proceeding to an analysis of Re
publican leaders, Dr. Barclay char
acterized Stassen's pre-convention
campaign as "very refreshing," prais
ing his forthright stand on foreign
and domestic issues. This type of
campaign, he said, carries out the
theory of the party system, in which
the candidates and their views are
presented to the people for evalua
tion and judgment.
In contrast to Stassen, Dr. Barclay
; spoke of Bricker as "'the politician's
i politician, the organization man."
Bricker's opinions on controversial
| subjects are well-balanced, Barclay
said, one half canceling the other
j half. Bricker is not campaigning in
other states and not taking a definite
| standâ€”thus, not making enemies. In
case of a convention deadlock, his 50
j votes may be increased until he wins
j the nomination.
Explaining Dewey's "silent" cam
paign, Barclay attributed at least part
of this policy to Dewey's experience
: in the 1940 Republican convention,
where Dewey found that pre-con
vention strength does not necessarily
mean victory.
"I think there is no doubt that
Dewey will accept the nomination if
i it is offered to him," Barclay said,
though commenting that Dewey can
not win the election by his pre
campaign methods.

Solemn and serious, Stanford
students knelt in Memorial Church
last night as they listened to the
President of the United States de
liver his prayer for the nation.
