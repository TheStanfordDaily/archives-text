# Roble Jubilant; Then Quiet
## 
### NADA SKIDMORE 
First word of the imminent D-Day
was received at Roble Hall shortly
after closing hours Monday night in
the same manner in which it was re
ceived across the continent.
A few late-listeners combining
radio pleasure with homework heard
the networks announce the uncon
firmed German reports of invasion
on the French coast. Doors jolted
open down corridors 2A, 3B —
through the length of Roble—and
groups of six or seven girls filled
every room containing a radio.
Call the Daily
Two Daily reporters, nickels
clutched in their hands, collided in
the hall on their way to the tele
phone. "The editor's calling it in to
the Shack," someone yelled, and the
two reporters were carried along by
the crowds back through an open
door.
The freshmen were quiet and tense
ns the same bulletins were repeated

! time and again. Bob Trout's smooth-
J rolling voice warned radio listeners
at minute intervals that the German
; reports were entirely unconfirmed by
allied headquarters. Smoke grayed
the Roble rooms where the little
groups gathered around the radio
centers of information. After two
I long hours the cigarette packages
| were nearly empty, and only a few
i Robleites were still there, listening,
! waiting.
! Ivondon Flash
Bob Trout had taken his CBS mike
I into the newsroom when the flash
i came through for London to take
over the wire. General Depuis began
; reading the first communique from
i Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expe
ditionary Forces, which confirmed
' the German releases. One freshman
tried to take it down in summer
■ school shorthand.
"Too darn rusty at it," she said as
she laid her pencil aside and bent
1 her head down closer to the radio.
"Invasion!" The single word

whipped through Roble's corridors
within 10 seconds of Depuis' last
words, rocking the same corridors
where other freshmen had received
news of the Japanese attack two and
a half years ago. Lagunita reported
Tuesday morning that Olivo, casa
standing within a few yards of Ro
ble's C wing, had heard that single
word "Invasion" from the hall's open
windows almost before the comple
tion of the communique.
Too Big for Me
Following the first outburst which
announced D-Day to heavy sleepers.
Roble was quiet. There was no cele
bration as the freshman women lis
tened to speeches from the leaders of
occupied nations. There was no com
ment when one news reviewer added.
"This is the beginning of the end. Let
us take one minute out for prayer.''
Someone expressed the general
feeling when she was asked for her
opinion on the developments of the
early morning hours -"It's a little
too big for me. Let's think it over."
