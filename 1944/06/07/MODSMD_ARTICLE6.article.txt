# The 						Hypocritic One-Acts
## 
### 
IT SEEMS kind of stupid (o waste time and space writing about the oh so
complex and disturbing social problems confronting the Stanford student.
But since Stanford students are enough concerncd about said subject to
raise a fuss, discuss it we will.
The meeting night before last was enlightening. It was enlightening
mainly for two reasons.
The first is that so few persons turned up. Student government is
ordinarily conducted by representatives of the students; when the students
had a chance to express themselves, when they were offered the opportunity
of direct representation, few of them showed any interest. It would almost
be safe to say that only a few of those present were individual thinkers
ralher than members of groups who gagged it up or had little arguments
arranged in advance. â€¢
The other enlightening thing about the meeting was the most revealing
of the two. It was this:
The number of hypocrites at the meeting was amazing. It got rather
comical after a while to hear a few of the so-called student leaders pro
claim that a person, at any rate a Stanford person, can most assuredly
conduct himself according to the Fundamental Standard.
A few of these individuals, professing the highest of ideals, raved on
about the Stanford student's ability to conduct himself (or herself) in an
attractive manner while under the influence of liquor. On and on it went.
Applause broke out constantly.
It all boils down to this:
Ideals are beautiful. They are workable. Hut those who talk one way
and act another either have poor memories or else they underestimate the
memories of others. And when you hear beautiful ideals falling from the lips
of persons you have seen swinging from the chandeliers or going into big
clinches on a dance floor because they were drunk, you sort of can't help
laughing. You hear the righteous words, your mind flashes 'back to a
certain party, and you just start laughing.
So what we got out of the meeting was an indication of poor interest
in student government and a wonderful show staged by some of the smooth
est of hypocrites.
