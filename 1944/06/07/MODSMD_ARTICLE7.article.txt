"INVASION," a flash report by the German radio, was first phoned to the
Daily staff Monday at 10:35 p.m. by Editor Irma CunHfc. Editor Cunha,
looked in at Ruble on a visit, had to be "restrained from beating down the
walls" to get to the Shack and was finally forced to direct operations by
telephone.
Ac-ting upon this information Night Editor Joan Hodgdon and Associate
Editor Dave Davis tore up the froht page of the first paper, which had
already been put to bed. This paper had left to right a picture of Dr. Tom
Barclay, the headline, "Barclay to Discuss Politicians," and the headline,
"Students Argue Social Problems." Dr. Barclay was killed, tfie story
dummied on an inside page, and three lines of large type with a bulletin,
flashed, "Invasion Reported by Germans.
Contact with Editor Cunha was re-established and more information
to the effect that this report was totally unconfirmed was announced.
This Daily, still tabloid size, was signed out at 1115, and everyone went
home including Daily Compositor M. E. Jones and Linotypist W. L. Cheney
— W. E. Bailey, who linotypes some Daily copy, remained in the shop setting
type for a new textbook in Japanese.
Around 12:30 confirmation from General Eisenhower broke on the radio
and was heard by Business Manager Bill Conley who rushed to get editorial
help for a new paper. Missing connections with Conley, editorial help
arrived at the Daily composing room minutes after Conley arrived with a
.squadron from Buchanan Hall.
(Miss Cunha was at this time, it is reported, proving dangerous to
residents of Roble Hall.)
It was decided at this point to change the format to full si/.e and the new
paper was underway.
A squad was dispatched to Mr. Jones' home where he was routed from
bed and returned to the composing room. Mr. Cheney was in San Carlos by
his time, but Mr. Bailey officiated at the linotype.
The boys from Buchanan were stationed at telephones and radios to
•heck any last-minute news, while the make-up and re-organization of
he new paper continued. Finally complete, Daily staff members checked
>ut the paper at 4 a.m. and staggered home.
(Editor Cunha, under the influence of strong drugs, had yet remained
uonseiouK until 4 and then been removed to the quiet ward: 3b.* — L.P.
