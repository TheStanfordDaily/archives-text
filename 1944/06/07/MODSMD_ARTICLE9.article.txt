A war-weary world—elated by the recent acquisi
tion of Rome —awoke Tuesday morning to find the long
awaited second front had started.
The first announcement of any allied activity against
the Festung Europa came via Radio Berlin. The an
nouncement came with such specificity and definite
ness about the allied onslaught against the Normandy
peninsula that it was hard to discredit the German
radio. There is a purpose in this. The time may come
later on when the enemy will be holding the high
cards and they will come out with an announcement
which we will find hard to discredit because they
formerly had announced only the truth. Goebbels is
just finding out what the Allies have known since
early in 1940 that, "Truth is the best propaganda." It
will be wise, however, to do just as many of us did last
night—await for confirmation from allied sources.
Last night's confirmation came almost with the same
suddenness and impact that the original announcement
possessed. At 12:32 PWT—the National Broadcasting
Company—who previously had announced they would
remain on the air all night—switched controls to
Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary
Forces. A cool British-sounding voice announced that
allied troops under the command of Gen. Sir Bernard
Montgomery had struck the French invasion coast in
the vicinity of Le Havre, the Somme delta and Cher
bourg on the Normandy peninsula.
At last reports at a late hour last night, allied
troops had punched deeper at these three points and
as yet had not received any substantial opposition.
The latest confirmed reports indicate that the Allies
are from nine to ten miles from the initial beachheads
and still marching further inland.
R.A.F. Spitfire pilots returning from a Tuesday after
noon sweep over the beachhead area said that they
could see many fires further inland and had supposed
this was the result of allied armored columns. The
point of deepest penetration was at Le Havre down the
valley of the Seine.
Fighting is in progress along a 100-mile front from
the Cherbourg peninsula area to just south of Dieppe—
scene of the 1942 "reconnaissance in force."
The Allies have not announced having possession of
any particular area or city. CBS London Correspondent
Ed Murrow said late Tuesday (early Wednesday, Lon
don summer time) that our anti-aircraft balloons were
floating high over the beachheads and that fighting had
expanded to such an extent that it could no longer be
considered beachhead fighting.
Fighter pilots returning from sweeps over the allied
occupied areas say the troops were lounging along the
French countryside roads, waiting patiently for mess
call. Other pilots indicate that troops were standing
erect.
General Sir Bernard Montgomery said late Tuesday
that he was pleased with the initial landing operations.
This greatest amphibious operation in history was
powered by 11,000 planes. 4.W0 ships and thousands of
lesser landing craft and a force of sea and air-borne
troops which appeared to proximate 250.000 men. ac
cording to Richard McMurray of the Associated Press.
Thi< would indicate there are a little over allied
divisions facing Rommel", rumored 20 division.

The A.P. said tanks waddled ashore along a hundred
miles of beaches.
Britain's cigar-chomping Prime Minister says that
operations are "proceeding in a thoroughly satisfactory
manner."
Actual points of allied engulfment seemed to be at
Cherbourg and Caen. This is unconfirmed.
However, shortly after the first announcement of the
invasion Monday night, the Allied Command did say
we were in possession of the channel islands of Guern
sey and Jersey.
And with all this excitement of D-Day—rumor is rife.
Late Tuesday evening a rumor circulated concerning
the invasion of Greece. It is confirmed, however, by the
Mediterranean-based Ninth Air Force that there has
been an unusual amount of air activity over Greece.
How true the Greek thrust is we don't know. Time
will tell.
