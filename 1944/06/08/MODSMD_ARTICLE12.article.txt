# Excom---Social Debate Still On
## 
### 
Excom last night appointed Daily I
Columnist Hayes Hunter the editor
of Quad for 1945. and at the same
time considered three major sugges- '
tions for a new social policy.
The primary suggestions were: (1)
(hat the standard of social conduct j
be incorporated in the Honor Code; j
(2) that (presented by new Excom
member Barney Gugel) responsi
bility for the irresponsibility of
others be attached to the appropriate
individual or group; and (3) that a
social policy be devised which would |
prohibit only off-campus dances.
At press time Julie Cromelin had
suggested that elements of all three
suggestions be incorporated in a new j
social policy.
