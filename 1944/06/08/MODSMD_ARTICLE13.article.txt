# 'Axe Me Another' Tomorrow At 6:45; Questions in Demand
## 
### 
Questions for tomorrow night's
"Axe Me • Another" quiz in the
Amphitheater are still in demand,
and to lubricate the cogs of students'
intellectual machinery. Charlie
Clark, general chairman of the event,
suggests questions like the following:
Where was Dr. Tresidder born?
On what corner of the Quad is Room
370? How many hundred yards is it
to Belts from the Administration
building?
The stress will be laid on questions
of "on-campus" interest—and from a
wide variety of subjects: musical,
humorous, serious, historical, and in
tellectual, according to Clark.
'Garfield Gats'
The program will open, he con
tinued, with a mellow melody by the
Garfield Gats, Jay Rut ledge, Jack
Stein, and Vernon Walker; after
which Clark wil offer a few intro
ductory remarks to pave the way for
Joe Sher, emcee.
There will then be a tabulation of
scores and announcement of winners.
Prizes will be given from the Cardi
nals; one to the winner, one consola
tion prize, and a special award to the
person c&ntributing the best ques
tion. It is therefore necessary for
persons to sign their questions. Gar

field Hall will close the program.
