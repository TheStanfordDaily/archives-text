# On It Goes—

"THE HYPOCRITIC ONE-ACTS," an editorial
appearing in yesterday's Daily, was taken in a
number of different ways. Some were jubilant,
saying "yes, yes, that's how it was the other
night." Others said, "Too bad—you've gotten
bitter." Others said, " 'Taint fair — we've been
good."
Maybe bitterness has set in. Maybe the view
was right, maybe not. But the fact remains that
it was not meant to indicate bitterness, which is
not felt, but merely to bring to light something
which since has been admitted by one student
who voiced his opinions at the meeting.
Another misunderstanding which resulted
from the editorial also must be cleared; some be
lieve that we expressed a distrust of idealistic
plans. Not so. We think they are desirable, and
we think they are workable; we merely said that
they sounded funny when uttered by certain
persons.
Ours, too, is an idealistic plan. It goes some
thing like this;
"No organization shall hold an off-campus
dance." Period. Since almost all planned group
functions are dances, most organized entertain
ment will be confined to campus. This has been
the past policy, and it should continue since no
one in his right mind would approve of big ex
penditure for the hiring of a hall for an off
campus dance.
As for other "functions" which occur off
campus, they should be planned or created on
the spur of the moment without the need of get
ting the permission of Excommittee.
The main problem which arises from these
"functions" is the fact that too many persons
become drunk and consequently obnoxious.
Perhaps the most logical and practical way of
controlling this situation is by doing two things:
First, campus leadexs not only have to believe
and talk Fundamental Standard, but also must
live up to it. Whenever it is known that they
have failed to do so, they can be reminded by
other campus leaders, not noisily, but never
theless, effectively.
Second, freshman sponsors must understand
the situation and preach not the evils of liquor,
but the stupidity of getting drunk and acting like
a fool. In line with this education program would
go perfect honesty in talking about campus
drunks. Tell them that some at Stanford do, that
those who do are most noticed, but not
the ones most admired or most fashionable to
copy. There's nothing wrong with drinking, and
we're not implying that there is; however, some
make it appear wrong.
And, after the war or whenever it can be ar
ranged, it would be a fine thing for Excommittee
to sponsor the creation of a sort of campus hang
out, perhaps physically like Dinah's or L'Ome
lette's, which would be open after dances, etc.
Maybe now the Nitery, although a poor substi
tute, could be arranged to be open for such a
purpose.
Whatever social plan is adopted, it is obvious
!hat the attitude of the individual will make it
successful or unsuccessful. And for those stu
dents who ignore the Fundamental Standard,
we can hope for only one thing: a joyful session
with one of the councils
