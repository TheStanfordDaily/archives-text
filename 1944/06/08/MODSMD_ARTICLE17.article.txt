Being some of the student leaders who gave
voice to what is perhaps an idealistic plan or
vision last Monday night and who freely admit
to having done our share of the chandelier
swinging in the past, we are called upon to
answer your editorial blast in Wednesday's
Daily.
In the first place, we believe you err in deny
ing that the plan advanced has merit by descend
ing to the level of personalities and dragging out
fables of those who advanced the plan. This is
dishonest reasoning and denies the fact that
those who advance it believe in it and will un
r
dertake to support it if it is made law.
Any law to remain long a respected law must
have the moral force of the people behind it.
This moral force will not exisft if the people
cannot see the reason behind the law, or if they
disagree with the reason. This fact is extremely
obvious in the case of our state law forbidding
minors to drink on on-sale premises. A good
many minors violate this law, and it lacks the
moral force to support it because these minors
go on the premise that if they are old enough to
fight a war, they are old enough to take a drink.
Such inconsistency within the law weakens it
and leads to greater problems.
It would seem to us that the chandelier swing
ing that has taken place in the past is the out
growth of our # lack of moral force behind our
regulations concerning liquor and off-campus
parties. When rules are unpopular, it becomes
fashionable to break them, and those who go in
for breaking the rules are laughed at, rather than
despised. Chandelier swinging is looked upon
with tolerant amusement rather than disgust.
The guilty ones, we chandelier-swinging rep
robates, seem to realize this now, and we there
fore advance a plan which will reverse the
prevalent attitude that drunkeness is tolerable
and misconduct funny. We put this forth with
great good faith and high hopes and are ready
to accept restriction if any experiment fails.
We believe firstly that any rule which denies
that the individual is capable of making correct
decisions concerning his conduct is an insult to i
the integrity and character of the individual and i
will result in a far-reaching reaction.
We believe, secondly, that any rule which
admits that the individual is capable of making
the correct decisions concerning his conduct,
and puts enforcement of the rule up to the indi-1
vidual and the group, will result in group ac-!
ceptance of the rule and consequent individual
and group application of the moral force toj
maintain the rule.
The group and the individual will jealously J
guard their prerogative, and the transgressor j
will feel the scorn of the group.
We believe that Stanford's experience with
the Honor Code bears out the above. The
proctor system is built on the assumption that ;
the individual is dishonest and will cheat, and
the result is that it becomes fashionable to cheat,
and little or no moral force on the part of the j
group is brought to bear on the individual who I
does cheat. He is getting away with something,
and no one but the proctor cares.
In the use of the Honor Code it is assumed
that the individual is a reputable character cap- <
able of honorable conduct. This code has en
dured because the students jealously guard the
privileges which are theirs under the Honor
-Code, and the transgressor is a despised outcast.
Whether laid down as a codified law or stated
as a general principle we believe that the social
policy of the A.S.S.U. should assume that Stan
ford men and women are capable of conducting
themselves in a gentlemanly manner, if the re-'
sponsibility is placed squarely upon them to do
so. This will have to be re-emphasized each
year to each in-coming class and to each class in '
the school at the time, as the Honor Code should
be in order that the Fundamental Standard will
become a living part of Stanford life, rather than
a once-read phrase in the Freshman's Handbook.

This moral force will not exisft if the people
cannot see the reason behind the law, or if they
disagree with the reason. This fact is extremely
obvious in the case of our state law forbidding
minors to drink on on-sale premises. A good
many minors violate this law, and it lacks the
moral force to support it because these minors
go on the premise that if they are old enough to
fight a war, they are old enough to take a drink.
Such inconsistency within the law weakens it
and leads to greater problems.
It would seem to us that the chandelier swing
ing that has taken place in the past is the out
growth of our # lack of moral force behind our
regulations concerning liquor and off-campus
parties. When rules are unpopular, it becomes
fashionable to break them, and those who go in
for breaking the rules are laughed at, rather than
despised. Chandelier swinging is looked upon
with tolerant amusement rather than disgust.
The guilty ones, we chandelier-swinging rep
robates, seem to realize this now, and we there
fore advance a plan which will reverse the
prevalent attitude that drunkeness is tolerable
and misconduct funny. We put this forth with
great good faith and high hopes and are ready
to accept restriction if any experiment fails.
We believe firstly that any rule which denies
that the individual is capable of making correct
decisions concerning his conduct is an insult to i
the integrity and character of the individual and i
will result in a far-reaching reaction.
We believe, secondly, that any rule which
admits that the individual is capable of making
the correct decisions concerning his conduct,
and puts enforcement of the rule up to the indi-1
vidual and the group, will result in group ac-!
ceptance of the rule and consequent individual
and group application of the moral force toj
maintain the rule.
The group and the individual will jealously J
guard their prerogative, and the transgressor j
will feel the scorn of the group.
We believe that Stanford's experience with
the Honor Code bears out the above. The
proctor system is built on the assumption that ;
the individual is dishonest and will cheat, and
the result is that it becomes fashionable to cheat,
and little or no moral force on the part of the j
group is brought to bear on the individual who I
does cheat. He is getting away with something,
and no one but the proctor cares.
In the use of the Honor Code it is assumed
that the individual is a reputable character cap- <
able of honorable conduct. This code has en
dured because the students jealously guard the
privileges which are theirs under the Honor
-Code, and the transgressor is a despised outcast.
Whether laid down as a codified law or stated
as a general principle we believe that the social
policy of the A.S.S.U. should assume that Stan
ford men and women are capable of conducting
themselves in a gentlemanly manner, if the re-'
sponsibility is placed squarely upon them to do
so. This will have to be re-emphasized each
year to each in-coming class and to each class in '
the school at the time, as the Honor Code should
be in order that the Fundamental Standard will
become a living part of Stanford life, rather than
a once-read phrase in the Freshman's Handbook.

Being some of the student leaders who gave

answer your editorial blast in Wednesday's
Daily.
In the first place, we believe you err in deny
