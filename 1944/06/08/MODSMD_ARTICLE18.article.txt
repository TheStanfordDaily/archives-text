# NOW THAT.. Chappie's Out
## 
### 
Bill Hyer's last contribution to the
campus morale, namely the spring
quarter Chappie, proved itself to be
the best of the year's mags.
Scooping the literary world, Hyer
dreamed up a theme that easily
eclipsed foregoing ones and followed
through with a generally excellent
apres la guerre issue—all of which
goes to justify (he sell-out of the
2,200 copies on the stands yesterday.

A 1 Cleveland did a repeat per
formance with another zippy opener,
adorned with the art of newcomer,
Flo Bailey. Fayram's artistic ideas
j promise "mucho" laughter in issues
to come.
The inclusion of the multiple Farm
I Fables was a great stroke, next to
the "no-we-don't-read-ariything-
I else" jokes.
