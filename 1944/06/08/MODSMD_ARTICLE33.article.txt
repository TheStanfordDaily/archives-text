# Tanner To Lead Christian Forum
## 
### 
"Some Types of Contemporary Re
j ligious Philosophy" will be the topic
j of discussion to be led by Mr. Obert
j C. Tanner at the University Chris
| tian Forum tonight, in the vestry of
I the Memorial Church, at 7:30 p.m.
Mr. Tanner spoke at the first of
J these forums, held three weeks ago,
| and has been asked by the students
! to return and speak again. He is an
j instructor in religion, and has trav
] eled all over the world in order to
come in close contact with the vari
! ous believers in the different relig
| ious philosophies.
These meetings are held for the
' benefit of the students and the fac
ulty. It is hoped that these forums
| will provide an opportunity for stu-
I dents and faculty to have a frank ex-
J change of ideas on these funda
j mental and important topics.
Last week, Mr. Mumby, a former
j missionary, explained the attitude of
j Gandhi to missionaries and Chris-
I tians.
