LONDON (UP)Allied orders to the French under-
I ground went out today by courier plane and radio
I broadcast for the sabotage of German communications
j and the immediate evacuation of towns about to be at
tacked by allied bomber?.
Other instructions wore broadcast as "personal mes
sages to leaders of French resistance groups in code
which they alone could understand such as "Jaques La
port, please immediately deliver your fresh cakes to
grandmother in Paris," "Madeline, the flowers which
you planted have wilted." "Roger, your laundry will be
ready Tuesday."
One immediate result, according to a Vichy report
reaching here by way of Stockholm was the blowing
up, at 42 points, ol the Sauur Lantua-Bellegarde railway
by French partisans. This is one of the routes over
which troops in Italy and southeastern France might
i be sent to the north Atlantic or Channel ports.
