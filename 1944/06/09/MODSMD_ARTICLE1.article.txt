SUPREME ALLIED H.Q., LONDON, June 9 (UP) - Allied troops,
victorious in the first phase of the invasion of France, battled Unlay within
I 1 miles oi the great port of Cherbourg and to the southeast the fall of vital
Caen was reported a matter of ''hours if not minutes."
Against the fierce resistance of J 0 hastily massed German divisions—
nearly 150,000 men—the Allies were striking deep inland on a front of 100
miles of curving shoreline from the Seine's estuary near Le Havre to the
Cherbourg area.
I'or th<' first time, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters revealed
that tin* main landings of Tuesday's invasion were made in the bay of Cher
bourg, at the Beriiicrcs-Sour-Mer north of Caen and Le Havre on the Seine
estuary:
Two of the allied divisions ashore in France were identified as the Amer
ican "Fighting" First, an old World War outfit whose modern version spear
headed the final assault in Tunisia and the British 50th Infantry Division.
One undesignated American division has alone captured more than 100,-
000 German prisoners.
Heavy fighting was reported raging for the lateral road linking Clier
bour and Carentan, 255 miles to the southeast where American troops in the
Valognes area where only 11 miles from the great port, in peacetime one
of the best in Europe. At least one junction had been effected in the penin
sula area between amphibious troops and air-borne units and other contacts
between the two invading groups had been made in the Caen area.
After a swaying battle the Caen road center, 9*/2 miles inland and 28
miles southeast of Le Havre, allied units drove up to the town and late last
night were "within hours or perhaps minutes of capturing it," an official ob
server cabled to headquarters.
Fierce counterattacks against units of the British Sixth air-borne division
north of Caen were thrown back while to the west, British tanks pushed well
south of captured Bayeux and mopped up cut-off enemy pockets.
All along the front, German tactical reserves have now been encountered
ushering in the "second phase" of the invasion and local but sharp counter
attacks have been thrown back in nearly every sector, an allied spokesman
said.
The new German arrivals were using the remote - controlled "beetle"
tanks which have also been reported on the Italian front, and a number of
the contrivances were captured as well as "hornet guns"—an 88-mni. weap
on mounted on Mark IV tank chassis.
