# Social Policy Formulated
## 
### 
Completing (lie preliminary steps
toward the new Social Policy, the
A.S.SU. Excom in its meeting
Wednesday night, adopted a regu-
I,it ion emphasizing reasonable and
proper conduct.
In essence, the newly adopted pol
icy allows any ofT-campus function
except an "organized dance" to be;
given without Excom clearance, hut
any misconduct , especially if in -
voling the excessive use of liquor, is
clearly provided for and will he
punished hy the councils.
Placement of Responsibility
The responsibility for maintaining
"Conduct Becoming a Stanford Stu
dent" at any function is definitely
placed upon the individual and the
group at the time and place of the
function itself.
Excom also felt that it should, in
view of the continuance of the war
and the universal feeling against any
lavish display, retain its old rule
against ofT-campus organized dances.
Provision for exceptional situations
was left with usual Excom clearance.
Fundamental Standard
In short, the committee defined a
special case of the old Fundamental
Standard, which, although it ap
peals in every Frosh Handbook, the
committee felt had been too much
lost sight of in the last few quarters.
The regulation, as adopted, follows:
"THE SOCIAL CODE. The So
cial Code is an undertaking of the
Students, individually and col
lectively, to conduct themselves at
all times in accord with the Funda
mental Standard ol Stanford.
'"Students will at all times up
hold all University regulations and
such policies formulated hy the
Associated Students. They will at
all times conduct themselves hc
cording to such high standards of
personal integrity and morality
that at no time will there he any
unfavorable reflection upon them
selves or the University.
"1. Considering good taste, there
shall he no organized dances oIT
campus, with exceptions to he con
sidered hy Executive Committee.
"2. Any student in a drunken
and disorderly condition shall he
subject to such discipline as the
appropriate Council shall deem
necessary.
Every student should abide
by the state and local liquor regu
lations, and any student appre
hended by civil authorities for vio
lation of said regulations, shall be
subject to such discipline as the
appropriate Council shall deem
necessary.
"4. Any student known to be in
the company of a student who is
drunk and disorderly, or at a func
tion at which such a person is
present, shall be equally respon
sible.
"5. All on - campus functions
shall he cleared through the A.S.
S.l'. oflire.
"All off-campus functions may
be registered in an individual's or
group's name at the A.S.S.U. office.
If not registered, all present at
such a function may be held re
sponsible."
it was repeatedly pointed out in
(he meeting that the policy was more
liberal than ever before, that en
forcement would be within the
bounds of reason, but that conduct
"unbecoming" would not be toler
ated.

it was repeatedly pointed out in
(he meeting that the policy was more
liberal than ever before, that en
forcement would be within the
bounds of reason, but that conduct
"unbecoming" would not be toler
ated.
Completing (lie preliminary steps
toward the new Social Policy, the
A.S.SU. Excom in its meeting
Wednesday night, adopted a regu-
I,it ion emphasizing reasonable and
proper conduct.
In essence, the newly adopted pol
icy allows any ofT-campus function
except an "organized dance" to be;
given without Excom clearance, hut
any misconduct , especially if in -
voling the excessive use of liquor, is
clearly provided for and will he
punished hy the councils.
Placement of Responsibility
The responsibility for maintaining
"Conduct Becoming a Stanford Stu
dent" at any function is definitely
placed upon the individual and the
group at the time and place of the
function itself.
Excom also felt that it should, in
view of the continuance of the war
and the universal feeling against any
lavish display, retain its old rule
against ofT-campus organized dances.
Provision for exceptional situations
was left with usual Excom clearance.
Fundamental Standard
In short, the committee defined a
special case of the old Fundamental
Standard, which, although it ap
peals in every Frosh Handbook, the
committee felt had been too much
lost sight of in the last few quarters.
The regulation, as adopted, follows:
"THE SOCIAL CODE. The So
cial Code is an undertaking of the
Students, individually and col
lectively, to conduct themselves at
all times in accord with the Funda
mental Standard ol Stanford.
'"Students will at all times up
hold all University regulations and
such policies formulated hy the
Associated Students. They will at
all times conduct themselves hc
cording to such high standards of
personal integrity and morality
that at no time will there he any
unfavorable reflection upon them
selves or the University.
