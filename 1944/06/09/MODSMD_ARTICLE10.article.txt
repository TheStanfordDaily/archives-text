# Social Policy Formulated
## 
### 
Completing (lie preliminary steps
toward the new Social Policy, the
A.S.SU. Excom in its meeting
Wednesday night, adopted a regu-
I,it ion emphasizing reasonable and
proper conduct.
In essence, the newly adopted pol
icy allows any ofT-campus function
except an "organized dance" to be;
given without Excom clearance, hut
any misconduct , especially if in -
voling the excessive use of liquor, is
clearly provided for and will he
punished hy the councils.
Placement of Responsibility
The responsibility for maintaining
"Conduct Becoming a Stanford Stu
dent" at any function is definitely
placed upon the individual and the
group at the time and place of the
function itself.
Excom also felt that it should, in
view of the continuance of the war
and the universal feeling against any
lavish display, retain its old rule
against ofT-campus organized dances.
Provision for exceptional situations
was left with usual Excom clearance.
Fundamental Standard
In short, the committee defined a
special case of the old Fundamental
Standard, which, although it ap
peals in every Frosh Handbook, the
committee felt had been too much
lost sight of in the last few quarters.
