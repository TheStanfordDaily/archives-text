# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
Now that a social policy has been acted upon
by Excom, the all-important problem of educa
tion presents itself.
In your editorial yesterday, the sponsors' re
sponsibility in educating freshmen to the Social
Policy was emphasized. This is important, but
experience with the Honor Code has shown us
that talking to just freshmen is not enough.
There must be constant repetition of this talk;
and some provision for explaining the policy to
transfers must be made, since they cannot be
expected to know any more about Stanford tra
ditions than beginning students.
To help solve this problem, could not a "Com
mittee on Social Policy Education" be set up
v/hich would do the same type of work that
the Honor Code committee does in educating
people to the Honor Code?
Referring to the "campus hangout," men
tioned in the editorial and favored by many
students, would it not be possible to make the
Nitery a good lounge, and to open the Union
dining room on certain Saturdays? This would,
until a regular club house is constructed, fa
cilitate those who want to do something slightly
sophisticated before dances, and yet do not
want to waste the gas, time, or money to go a
few miles down the highway. Many students

also want a place where there is more of a
"home-like" atmosphere (the Nitery, at present,
certainly doesn't serve that purpose).
Sincerely,
â€”Jim Emerson

To the Editor:
As a representative of the group who peti
tioned for recognition of tne American Youth
for Democracy, I wish to thank the members
of Excom for the time they spent and the gener
ally fair attitude shown in hearing our petition.
In spite of their rejection of our petition, we,
as a group who are interested in working for
democracy, appreciate the democratic attitudes
shown by many of the people at the meeting.
Sincerely,
Barbara Shepardson.
