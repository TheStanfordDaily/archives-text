# Records on Review

Nottingham Not a Ham
Last week's Champagne Ball featured Gary
Nottingham and his orchestra. Nottingham turns
out to be one of the smoothest society bands in
the business. He is typical of the many compe
tent bands, far superior to similar but more
heralded orchestras, lacking only the break
needed to get over the hump. His sections
phrase and blend with a touch gotten only from
long experience, and most important is the
fact that he knows how to arrange a set of
numbers to bring in a wide variety of tempos,
j Future dance committees should remember that
j we have a competent man in the locality and
think first before dragging out a big name for
the sake of a big name. Incidentally, this is no!
a paid advertisement.
Fuss Over Russell
S.F., it seems, turns up with its own Frank
Sinatra in Andy Russell. Russell is a local boy
who seems to be riding to fame on Frankie's
fame. Russell not only sounds like Sinatra,
which may or may not be an advantage; but he
phrases in the same way and sings the same
numbers. His new record is "Amor" and"The
Day After Forever."
i More About "Amor"
"Amor" is a three-year-old South American
number with new words by Sunny Skylar. It's
the type of piece that does well in the juke
, boxes and should end up high on the list. "Day
After" is sentimentally far better than it is musi
cally, but it is doing well already and its writers
boast half a dozen hits and can get ready to add
! this. Russell sings the way Sinatra would sing
if Sinatra spent less time mugging and more
singing.
Woody Herman turns out "Irresistible You"
and "Milkman Keep Those Bottles Quiet." "Ir
resistible" is about the most commercial piece
of music ever recorded, but commercial num
bers are Woody's specialty and he makes the
best of the situation. Although it's easy to spec
ulate ex post facto, it wasn't very difficult for
anyone to predict the success of "Milkman."
It seems that if you speed up the tempo, in
clude the words "swing shift" and use shipy
paper you have the makings of a hit. The writ
ers of "Milkman" did just that and their number
is on its way. We can't help being reminded
of last quarter's "Ten Bucks and Twenty-four
Hours' Leave," written by a Stanford ASTP boy,
which was also on its way, but undeservedly
got lost at one of the many turns in the road.
For the benefit of Barney Gugel, who spent
some twenty lines meditating over whether
Sabu hit E or E flat, the highest Sabu ever got
was on the back of an elephant.
