The widely heralded battle of the
sexes between the cellar-dwelling
Buchanan Bearcats and the Lagunita
All-Star baseball team last night
night turned out to be so much of a
farce that it was called in the third
inning hs no contest. Final score was
somewhere around 10 to 0 in favor
of Buchanap, although nobody seems
lo have bothered to keep the exact
tally. Attempts by the girls to halt
the smashing march of the Bearcats,
such as limiting them to one out per
inning, proved of no avail as the boys
from out yonder continued on the
rampage.
Ace Pitcher Don McKellar of the
Buchananites held the girls scoreless
throughout the three innings, with
not a single runner advancing beyond
second base. Wyoming Atkinson
pitched a good game for the girls,
but received practically no support
from her fielders.
After the third inning the girls
graciously suggested that perhaps the
game was too boring for (he Bearcats,
and the participants were then split
up into two mixed squads, McKellar
pitching for one and Wyoming for
the other. McKellar's team won,
3 to 2.
