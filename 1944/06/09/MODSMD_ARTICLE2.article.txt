# NEXT THRUST MAY BE AT PAS DE CALAIS
## 
### Dave Davis 
Because Allied armies may at any minute
launch another invasion thrust, possibly in the
Pas de Calais region, the Daily presents infor
mation concerning the geographic nature of that
area.
The French word pas, meaning "step," is also
translated as "strait." Thus the Pas de Calais
that appears on maps off the coast of northeast
France is the French equivalent for the more
commonly known Dover Strait.
Dry land Pas de Caalis is a district of north
east Fiance, only one other district away from
the Belgian border. Its northern shore presents
the section nearest to England for the next po
tential thrust.
The Pas de Calais district, or department, as
, the French call it, covers an area about half as
big as Connecticut, extending inland about 90
miles. It is normally a highly productive farm-

ing region as well as an important industrial
section of France, with a large coal output and
many operating factories.
Pushing out to a point at Cap Gris Nez (Cape
Grey Nose), Pas de Calais is less than 20 miles
from the English port of Dover. Due south from
Gris Nez, along a sheer coastline that resembles
the steep headland itself, is the port of Boulogne,
also in the Pas de Calais department.
About the same distance from Gris Nez, north
eastward along the coast, is Calais, normally the
largest and most important port of the depart
ment. This section of coast is the one most
closely and directly facing England. From the
low, sandy shore, framed by many dunes, old
Calais itself rises from a dune island like a
medieval fortress, separated from the surround
ing land and the newer industrial town by a
moat-like chain of canals and basins.
