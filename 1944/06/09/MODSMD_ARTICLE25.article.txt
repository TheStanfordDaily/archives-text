### DICK BLOCK 
Wednesday's track meet was a step }
in the right direction toward a bet
ter sports program on campus. The \
\ contenders were of equal ability,
which is clearly shown in the com- i
: parative scores. Company A looms j
: up as a very strong contender if :
there is another meet, and if our !
spies are correct the SCU men are
j eager for another chance so they
| might dethrone the civilians.
Prairie Flower
Who is this gal "Wyoming"? Al-
I though reports are meager, we hear
j she is the person to whom Lagunita [
has entrusted with the job of beating j
j the Buchanan men this evening.
! (We write these things at about 4
; o'clock in the afternoon, so we do not 1
I know the results of this great battle, :
j but through the mysterious element
; of time you may glance over to the
! adjoining column and read the report
of the game from the capable pen of
I Bill Adams.)
Hey Mabel
If Adkinson, Mabel Louise, Casper,
Wyo. Lai L 17-3, 165 Lagunita,
"Wyoming" to you, really is as good
jas her friends tell, the Lagunita
! femmes would do well against any
male coalition. Last night should
have told the story—ask a Buchanan
| man.
! Time's-a-Wastin
Is you or is you ain't going to have j
a playoff between the Army and
; Civilians in sol'tball? The Colonel
Eden League still has the game be
tween companies A and C, but prep
arations should be made now for a \
game in the very near future, bring
ing the highly publicized Meds up i
I against the army champs. There is {
not much time left in this quarter,
j so we feel arrangements for said con- |
diet should be made now to assure j
I a date being set aside.
The Meds played in the civilian
I circuit, but their squad is composed i
mainly of navy students. In the final
j tally of championships this quarter
the Army has gained one crown,
swimming, to the civilians one, track.
The civilian soccer team has yet to
taste defeat also. This Softball con
i test will be a good measure to show 1
i who is more apt in athletic en- j
' deavors.

Is you or is you ain't going to have j
a playoff between the Army and
; Civilians in sol'tball? The Colonel
Eden League still has the game be
tween companies A and C, but prep
arations should be made now for a \
game in the very near future, bring
ing the highly publicized Meds up i
I against the army champs. There is {
not much time left in this quarter,
j so we feel arrangements for said con- |
diet should be made now to assure j
I a date being set aside.
The Meds played in the civilian
I circuit, but their squad is composed i
mainly of navy students. In the final
j tally of championships this quarter
the Army has gained one crown,
swimming, to the civilians one, track.
The civilian soccer team has yet to
taste defeat also. This Softball con
i test will be a good measure to show 1
i who is more apt in athletic en- j
' deavors.
Wednesday's track meet was a step }
in the right direction toward a bet
ter sports program on campus. The \
\ contenders were of equal ability,
which is clearly shown in the com- i
: parative scores. Company A looms j
: up as a very strong contender if :
there is another meet, and if our !
spies are correct the SCU men are
j eager for another chance so they
| might dethrone the civilians.

Who is this gal "Wyoming"? Al-
I though reports are meager, we hear
j she is the person to whom Lagunita [
has entrusted with the job of beating j
j the Buchanan men this evening.
! (We write these things at about 4
; o'clock in the afternoon, so we do not 1
I know the results of this great battle, :
j but through the mysterious element
; of time you may glance over to the
! adjoining column and read the report
of the game from the capable pen of
I Bill Adams.)
Hey Mabel
If Adkinson, Mabel Louise, Casper,
Wyo. Lai L 17-3, 165 Lagunita,
"Wyoming" to you, really is as good
jas her friends tell, the Lagunita
! femmes would do well against any
male coalition. Last night should
have told the story—ask a Buchanan
