# Need Hobbies At Hospital
## 
### 
Students who have collections as
hobbies are asked to volunteer to
explain these collections to the pa
tients of Dibble General Hospital. A
program is being arranged by the
Red Cross so that every Saturday
afternoon a collector will explain his
hobby from 2 to 3, according to Jean
nette Grimsley, SWB social coordi
nator.
Collections of any kind will be
welcome, some that have been sug
gested are: collections of buttons,
rings, charms, knives, pipes, coins, or
stamps. Collections that need no ex
planation other than a small card
will be placed in a locked glass case,
donated by the Palo Alto Community
Center, for a week.
The response to the request for
students to explain their hobbies to
men at Dibble has been small be
cause few students have their col
lections on campus. But students
coming back summer quarter are
urged to bring back any hobby they
have and offer to explain it to the
patients.
The purpose of explaining hobbies
is to give the men an interest in
something that they perhaps could
collect after they get out of the hos
pital.
The Red Cross is depending upon
Stanford to fill their July and August
schedules. Anyone wishing to help is
asked to contact Miss Grimsley, 9079,
or Alice Tuttle, 22151.
