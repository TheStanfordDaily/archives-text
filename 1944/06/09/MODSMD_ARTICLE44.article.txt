# Soldiers Hold All-Campus Dance
## 'Hellzapoppin' Saturday Eve 
### 
Hear ye, hear ye, the biggest and
best dance of the spring quarter is
the "Hellzapoppin" dance being
given this Saturday night by the
Army Student Council. The sweet
est orchestra in the Bay Area will
be on hand. Namely, the Shoemaker
Field Band, which features three ex-
Charlie Spivak men, two men from
Sonny Dunham's line pre-war band,
and a sideman from Ole Kay Ky
ser's Kollege.
Feature Campus Talent
Running entertainment will fea
ture the outstanding campus talent.
Nan Tillson, Don Blub, Jean Levin
son, John Madigan, Rena Black, Al
Reeves, Jane Gillespie and all the
other popular campus entertainers
will contribute to the general mer
riment.
Decorations by Sloan and LaPlantc
Decorations are being done by
Sloan and LaPlante, whose fine work
was a feature of the Spring Show.
The gremlins will be working over
time as the Beauty Contest judges
wander around the floor appraising
the co-eds and debating over blonde
vs. brunette, upsweeps vs. long bobs,
dimples vs. moles, etc. The Queen
will be awarded a useful gift indica
tive of the honor and will rule
supreme.

Tom (Gourmet) Fletcher has ar
ranged for delicious toll house cook
ies in abundance, and claims that
even the cokes will be superior to
any others heretofore produced.
Officers Guest Sponsors
Guest sponsors at the dance are
Col. and Mrs. Eden, Capt. Brown,
Capt. and Mrs. Frank, and Lt. and
Mrs. McCoy.
Surprises galore are promised by
Don Bluh, who is in charge of the
feature entertainment. The dance is
informal, and he is planning to make
it a "let your hair down and have a
good time" evening.
Door Prizes to Be Surprise
Door prize number one is a $25
war bond, and the other door prizes
are being kept a closely guarded se
cret by members of the committee.
Some of these will really be good for
a belly laugh.

Student Council also invites all cam
pus groups, service or civilian, to
