# Civvies Win Track Meet; GI's Take Swim Honors
## 
### MIKE SULAK 
It's old stuff nowâ€”the Wednesday
track meet in which the civilians
showed their heels to A Co., C Co.,
and the Med School thin-clads.
Trailing the winners by 8 points, A
Co. standouts included Franny Ma
her, who copped the 220 dash and the
shotput, and Joe Okarski, whose
prodigious heave topped the discus
efforts.
C Co. Poor Third
Winding up a poor third, C Co's

j bright spots were the eight-man mile
relay, the pick-a-back relay, and the
i Sad Sack novelty. Last Friday eve
ning A Co. splashed to- a little pub
i licized upset victory in the quad
rangular swim meet. The well-or
ganized A Co. squad garnered
j enough second and third places to
amass 26 points.
Favored Medics Lose
C Co.'s two-man team of Cozens
and Castle piled up 1(J counters, one
more than the civilians who were
led by "Free" King and Bruce Jes
sup. The Medics, favored in the pre
meet dope, scored only 6 points, on
Marquette's springboard perform
ance.
Despite bad weather and an er
roneous announcement of the time
of the meet, the entire competition
went off smoothly and without de
lays.
New Meet Announced
Myron Sprague has announced an
other quadrangular meet for Sat
urday, June 17, at 1 p.m. Events will
include 50, 100, 150-yard free style.

Japs Take Crown
On the diamond, Denzene twirled,
Jap bats rattled, and it was victory
No. 6 for the Translators. The Chi
nese were outscored 9-8, for the
wind-up of A C. softball schedule,
j Leading the way for the champs was
Bob Friedman, who got three for
three and drove in four runs. The
Dutch ten broke even for the season
by battering the ERC 9-5, as the
cellar-dwellers' five-run rally in the
final frame fell short.
League Race Knotted
A glance at C Co. standings shows
a triple tie for first, the Sacks,
Hounds, and B.P. Commandos each
sporting a 2-1 record. Last week
Sheftell pitched and battled the
Sacks to a 5-2 win over the Texans.
The Commandos outslugged Section
Six in an 18-10 run-making orgy to
toss the league into the three-way
deadlock.
Important Tilt Scheduled
Following press time last night,
two clashes were on tap: Section Six
vs. Texans, and the all-important
Hound-Commando tussle.
Bringing the ping-pong up to date,
Ralph Aldridge beat Andy Noel to
I earn the regimental championship.
