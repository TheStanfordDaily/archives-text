# Unity at Home Needed to Back Invasion Armies—An Editorial
## 
### Sidney Rittenberg 
We are writing not only as soldiers, but as Stanford students:
It is clear that another great day has dawned in American
history. We, who struck down tyranny from Yorktown to Appo
mattox, from the Ebro to Tarawa—we, with our Allies, are on the
beaches of France!
On this great day, as our American brother at the beach-head
fights his way inland, does he not glance back over his shoulder
at us, to see whether we are on the offensive behind him? He
is destroying enemy tanks—does he not look to us to destroy
another egually potent Nazi weapon, disunity? Has he not heard
from another beach-head—Anzio—how the Nazis dropped thou
sands of copies of cartoons from a certain large American news
paper preaching Berlin-inspired disunity.? And how the men at
Anzio disregarded this stab in the back, and swept on to the
liberation of Rome?
We think that he has heard of things like this, our Brother at
the Second Front, and that he feels that even those of us who
hesitated to speak before are speaking now—offensively, in tune
with his offensive!
Let us not disappoint him. As we send him our production,
our War Bonds, and our blood, let us send him assurance of
our more complete unity, overcoming narrow partisanship
whether it be disguised the "rightest" or "ultra-leftist."
So, think. Last year, did you hear someone insult the Negro
soldier and his family? And were you silent? The time has
come to speak against back-stabbing discrimination!
Last month, did you hear someone explain, in weighty
phrases, how the magnificent British people were so "reaction
ary" that they were a drag on the war effort? And were you
silent, on the defensive? Your time is now—silence these de
featists!
Last week, did you hear someone carp and cavil at our Soviet
Ally, or red-bait win-the-war citizens with whose personal poli
tics they disagree? Well, now is the time: against all such petty
bickering—speak with a voice of thunder, to match the thunder
of our united guns!
For another great day has dawned. It is now up to us. Every
thing for the Front! Give to the last drop of our energy, and
destroy to the last iota our partisan prejudices! . . .
. . . And shorten the gap between "D" Day and"V" Day!

. . . And shorten the gap between "D" Day and"V" Day!
We are writing not only as soldiers, but as Stanford students:
It is clear that another great day has dawned in American
history. We, who struck down tyranny from Yorktown to Appo
mattox, from the Ebro to Tarawa—we, with our Allies, are on the
beaches of France!
On this great day, as our American brother at the beach-head
fights his way inland, does he not glance back over his shoulder
at us, to see whether we are on the offensive behind him? He
is destroying enemy tanks—does he not look to us to destroy
another egually potent Nazi weapon, disunity? Has he not heard
from another beach-head—Anzio—how the Nazis dropped thou
sands of copies of cartoons from a certain large American news
paper preaching Berlin-inspired disunity.? And how the men at
Anzio disregarded this stab in the back, and swept on to the
liberation of Rome?
We think that he has heard of things like this, our Brother at
the Second Front, and that he feels that even those of us who
hesitated to speak before are speaking now—offensively, in tune
with his offensive!
Let us not disappoint him. As we send him our production,
our War Bonds, and our blood, let us send him assurance of
our more complete unity, overcoming narrow partisanship
whether it be disguised the "rightest" or "ultra-leftist."
So, think. Last year, did you hear someone insult the Negro
soldier and his family? And were you silent? The time has
come to speak against back-stabbing discrimination!
Last month, did you hear someone explain, in weighty
phrases, how the magnificent British people were so "reaction
ary" that they were a drag on the war effort? And were you
silent, on the defensive? Your time is now—silence these de
featists!
Last week, did you hear someone carp and cavil at our Soviet
Ally, or red-bait win-the-war citizens with whose personal poli
tics they disagree? Well, now is the time: against all such petty
bickering—speak with a voice of thunder, to match the thunder
of our united guns!
For another great day has dawned. It is now up to us. Every
thing for the Front! Give to the last drop of our energy, and
destroy to the last iota our partisan prejudices! . . .
. . . And shorten the gap between "D" Day and"V" Day!
