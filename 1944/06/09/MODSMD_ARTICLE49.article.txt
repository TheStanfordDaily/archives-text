# G.I. JIVE
## 
### ROGER WILCO 
D-Dy has come, as we all knew it
must, and people the world over are
bracing for the push and the sacri- â– 
file. Many of us here have queasy
consciences about not being in the
front line. To you I say, read Sid Kit
tenberg's edit. And now thai the
Kaaiaah has spoken . . . let's make
with the jive.
Among things that stagger the
imagination:
"Padre" Reecc trying to speak with
both his hands tied, or Dimples Bar
bee with half his moustache shaved
olf, or Ken Harris minus the two
stars.
Wolfred Swan pursuing that lovely
blonde WAC t'other nite proves the
old adage about the best way to catch
flies.
The blood bank is passing up a
good opportunity at Encina, where
Bleeder Donohue is always deliver
ing in profusion after any exam.
Non-swimmers are cautioned to be
careful when in his vicinity.
Add classroom laughs: the immediate
resemblance noted by Bio. lecturees
to a certain striped campus creature
when a lantern slide of the paleo
lithic man was shown!!
The brighter side: Lois Williams
stopping by to hear the band at En
cina Wednesday. The fine coopera
tion given by the military authorities
in making Hellzapoppin possible.
Congrats to Rittenberg, whose edit
of May 12 was reprinted in the UCLA
BRUIN and N Y. SUN. Good luck to
Col Soares, who leaves us soon. . . .
Condolences to the boys who came
out second best at parchcsi. . . . Some
does it every week!!!
Felicitations to Ken Lawson, who
finally took the leap this week. And
now . . . Take it, Winnie, for the
WAC.
UP THE HILL
We'd like to nominate Pfc. Thelma
Clay as the shortest soldier in many
a mile. (She claims to be ''just over"
60 inches. Born and bred in Okla
homa, "Shorty" gi-aduated from her
state's university several years ago
and taught high-school mathematics
prior to enlisting last summer. Be
fore coming to Stanford she was in
aerial photography at March Field.
OVERHEARD .... the other evening
a{ the Mosers' when representatives
from Company A and the pink palace
were given a picnic: "Let's hold
metatarsals." (Young man I wear
shoes on my tarsals.*) .... the eve
before the last kines ex: "May I
borrow your humerous for 10 min
utes?" .... experimenting in the
physiology lab: "Stop breathing for
a few minutes so's I can take your
pulse."
WACs get new uniforms
According to what we hear enlisted
and commissioned WACs will have
new off-duty uniforms before this
summer is over with. The new out
fit consists of a tan shirtwaist dress
with overseas cap and glove to match.
