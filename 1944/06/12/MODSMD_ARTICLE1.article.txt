# Farm Opens Own Fifth War Loan
## 
### 
War Stamps and Bonds will go on
sale today in the Bond Booth as the
Fifth War Loan Drive begins on
campus. A quota has been set at
$25,000, and the drive will continue
all this week, announced Carol Hur
witz, SWB coordinator.
After a grand opening at the SCU
dance Friday night when stamps and
bonds were sold at a booth to cele
brate Stanford's "B-Day," the drive
will begin today all over campus with
special events planned during the
week.
Voluntary Contributions
Contributions to this drive are
purely voluntary, but all students
should realize their individual re
sponsibility to invest in the govern
ment and thus back the invasion as
much as they can, stated Bev An
dreuccetti, stamp sales chairman.
"Double your quarter, make the
war shorter" is the slogan for the
drive in women's living groups. All
women students are asked to buy at
least two 25-cent stamps this week
instead of one. War Stamps will be
sold in women's living groups all
day Thursday.
Bond Booth Open
Bonds and stamps will be sold all
week in the bond booth to men stu
dents, faculty members, and Uni
versity employees. This is the only
place on campus that bonds will be
sold this week.
Any students, especially seniors,
who wish to join the Alumni Asso
ciation may get a life membership
(which usually cost $50) by buying a
$50 "F" War Bond in the Alumni
Association's name this week. These
bonds may be purchased at the bond
booth.
Rally Planned
A rally is being planned for next
Thursday night and will be held in
front of the Cellar from 7 to 7:30. It
will be followed by an informal
dance and entertainment in the
Nitery from 7to 10:15.
After any meeting scheduled for
ibis week, such as the Tuesday Eve
ning Series, girls will sell stamps and
bonds. At the second SCU dance
next Friday night a booth will be
set up where more stamps and bonds
will be sold.
