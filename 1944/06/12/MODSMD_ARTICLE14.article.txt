### 
LONDON (UP) â€” The Red Army,
j swinging into action four days after
the allied invasion of France, has
opened its summer offensive on the
eastern front with a drive against
the Karelian Isthmus of Finland that
has pierced the enemy's lines to a
depth of almost 15 miles in two days,
: Moscow announced tonight.
The march into Finland, possibly
\ marking the first Russian participa-
I tion in the "master plans" devised at
j the Teheran Conference this year,
] was the first outbreak of the Russo
| Finnish front in 31 months and it was
j expected to be followed quickly by
j other Red Army thrusts along the
i 1,000 - mile main eastern front
| stretching from the Gulf of Finland
j to the Black Sea.
