# Quiz Show Proves Hilarious Success
## 
### 
Among the few hundred students
who turned out for Friday night's
quiz show, Ask Me Another, pre
sented in the Frost Amphitheater,
there were few who did not agree
that Cardinals had put on a novel and
at times hysterical hour of compan
ionable entertainment. Bigger and
j better shows in the future have the
| endorsement of all who commented
to Daily reporters.
Thanks to the staging of General
I Chairman Clarlic Clark, who had
I deposited the students in mammoth
j red armchairs, while the faculty
J squirmed in the seats of grammar
school desks, the show had a good
start even before Emcee Joe Sher
took over.
Sher Good
Sher, perfect in the role of co
ordinator, ad libbed with the con
testants. and plunged jovially off the
j deep end with a few of Bob Hope's
j better gags. From the faculty corner,
Professor Sensabaugh's ready an
j swers chalked up the majority of
j points, while Dick Driscoll's micro-
J phone manner was largely instru
j mental in the students' victory.
Jim Reynolds performed under
cover of blonde curls, commenting to
no avail, and dancing with partner
and Seorckeepcr Barbara Bonner. All
in all the cast for the show was ex
j pertly chosen, and several should
definitely be retained in the event of
\ future performances.
Awards went to the students—s3
in war stamps—to the teachers—gi-
I gantic red-white-and-blue suckers—
and to Dick Bartle a box of choco
j lates for contribution of the best
j question.
Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U. proxy, and
| student contestant, said, "Cardinals
! put on a fine show, and I'm looking
forward to more in the future. John
! Kieran and 'Information Please' have
nothing on us."
