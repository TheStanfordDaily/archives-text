### Hayes Hunter 
The reason for the lack of the expected floods of news for
the past few days since the invasion is one that most of us peri
odically forget. We wondered why we didn't get more news
right away after the North African campaign we wondered why
the news was sadly lacking for seventy-two hours after the
Sicilian campaign opened up.
Il boils down to one thing. The opening gun in a thrust such
as the Allies threw at France Tuesday morning is always spec
tacular and engulfs many types of main stories and sidebars.
These are all released instantly and of course occupy many
lines of newspaper print and considerable time on the air.
Sparring Stage
The main and outstanding reason perhaps is the fact that the
Allies at present are sparring with the enemy. The situation is
analogous to a boxer who steps into the ring and spars and feels
out his opponent's methods for the first round.
Montgomery, Eisenhower and Bradley are doing just this
right now. They have thrown one punch at the enemy and are
waiting to see how he reacts and just how he will declare him
self.
Waiting lor Something
The general staff now has certain preconceived ideas in wait
ing as an answer to any counter-attack that Kesselring, Rommel
or Von Rundstedt may cook up. For now, the expression of one
of the fighter pilots returning from a sweep over the continent
will suffice. Said he: "They are standing erect and lounging
along the country roads waiting patiently for something to
happen."
This sparring around is not conducive to good news. It oc
cupies about one inch in ordinary communigue space in news
paper copy and it isn't worth transmitting across the Atlantic
Ocean for a special radio pickup. In order to pay for costs they
more or less have to wait until enough of this piles up to make
it important enough to transmit.

But—things will be popping shortly, if General Sir Bernard
Montgomery has his way.
Speaking to newsmen at the front the other day, Monty said
it felt good to be back at the old stand, facing Rommel. Monty
is one up on Rommel and for that reason feels somewhat secure.
Newsmen said Monty slyly chuckled and rubbed his hands to
gether in expectation.
When these two men meet again on the field of battle and
pit their respective military brains and strategies against one
another in a running battle—then you will have more news than
you know what to do with.
Hours of Grace Up
Things are bound to break wide open soon. The 72-hour
grace period is up and some form of a German counter-attack
should be in the offing.
In the mean time, content yourselves with reading the news
about Italy. It was only Sunday that this area of operations was
all consuming. Now it is in the background.

Sparring Stage
The main and outstanding reason perhaps is the fact that the
Allies at present are sparring with the enemy. The situation is
analogous to a boxer who steps into the ring and spars and feels
out his opponent's methods for the first round.
Montgomery, Eisenhower and Bradley are doing just this
right now. They have thrown one punch at the enemy and are
waiting to see how he reacts and just how he will declare him
self.
Waiting lor Something
The general staff now has certain preconceived ideas in wait
ing as an answer to any counter-attack that Kesselring, Rommel
or Von Rundstedt may cook up. For now, the expression of one
of the fighter pilots returning from a sweep over the continent
will suffice. Said he: "They are standing erect and lounging
along the country roads waiting patiently for something to
happen."
This sparring around is not conducive to good news. It oc
cupies about one inch in ordinary communigue space in news
paper copy and it isn't worth transmitting across the Atlantic
Ocean for a special radio pickup. In order to pay for costs they
more or less have to wait until enough of this piles up to make
it important enough to transmit.
Monty Chuckled
But—things will be popping shortly, if General Sir Bernard
Montgomery has his way.
Speaking to newsmen at the front the other day, Monty said
it felt good to be back at the old stand, facing Rommel. Monty
is one up on Rommel and for that reason feels somewhat secure.
Newsmen said Monty slyly chuckled and rubbed his hands to
gether in expectation.
When these two men meet again on the field of battle and
pit their respective military brains and strategies against one
another in a running battle—then you will have more news than
you know what to do with.
Hours of Grace Up
Things are bound to break wide open soon. The 72-hour
grace period is up and some form of a German counter-attack
should be in the offing.
In the mean time, content yourselves with reading the news
about Italy. It was only Sunday that this area of operations was
all consuming. Now it is in the background.
The reason for the lack of the expected floods of news for
the past few days since the invasion is one that most of us peri
odically forget. We wondered why we didn't get more news
right away after the North African campaign we wondered why
the news was sadly lacking for seventy-two hours after the
Sicilian campaign opened up.
Il boils down to one thing. The opening gun in a thrust such
as the Allies threw at France Tuesday morning is always spec
tacular and engulfs many types of main stories and sidebars.
These are all released instantly and of course occupy many
lines of newspaper print and considerable time on the air.
