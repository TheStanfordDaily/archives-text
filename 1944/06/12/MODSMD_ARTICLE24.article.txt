## THE 						OLD UNION CELLAR

I
Your waist-line will be thinner
If you eat your daily dinner
At the Cellar where they serve you with a smile.
Yet at times you'll feel ill-treated
When the menu is depleted,
And all you get is eggs cooked country stylo.
II
The long and endless waiting
Is at times quite aggravating
And you'll want to knock your hasher for a loop,
But the thing about that sadist
That is bound to make you maddest
Is he serves your chocolate "a la" with tho soup.

The small and scraggly salad
Fiiils to tantailize your palate,
So you stare at it and softly say "Alas. 1 '
Those salads are so puny
That it nearly drives you looney
Trying to find one with a magnifying glass.
IV
The one redeeming grace
About that cheerful eating place
Is the liquid that they keep in shining vats.
We can do naught else but state
That the Cellar coffee's great.
It's the best damn thing there is for killing rats.
