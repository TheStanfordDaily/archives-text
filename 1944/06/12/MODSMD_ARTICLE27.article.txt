# Tresidder Speaks at Tour of Stanford Lane
## Penicillin Research. Cadet Nurse Training Explained 
### 
Keynoting a press tour of Stanford Lane Hospital conducted May 25. Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder described the work being done at the medical school
as one example of the way in which members of Stanford departments are
working together for the war—and for after the war.
Dr. Tresidder spolte at the luncheon served to the 15 or 20 press repre-

♦ sentatives half way through the tour,
which was conducted by Dr. Loren
R. Chandler, Dean of the School of
Medicine.
Wartime Med School
At the meeting which opened the
j tour Dr. Chandler discussed the three;
I principal phases of the Stanford
Medical School in wartime — army
' and navy medical training, U.S.
J Cadet Nurse training, and war and
postwar medical research.
At present there are 79 army and
about (50 navy trainees in the medi
cal school. Next year the number of
service trainees must be upped to 27
per cent Army and 25 per cent Navy,
j leaving only 48 per cent of the
| school's capacity open for civilian
: trtflning, according to Dr. Chandler.
At present of the 144 nurses in
training at Stanford Lane 188, or 82
per cent, are cadet nurses. The pur
pose of the cadet nursing program
has been to recruit more young
women into nursing and to accelerate
the essential instruction and experi
ence in nursing school curriculum
from 36 months to 24 to 30 months.
1 Cadet Nursing
Cadet nurses must pledge them
selves to essential nursing for the
j duration of the war. This can be
| either military or civilian nursing,
j Membership in the Army or Navy
; Nurse Corps at the end of her 30-
month training period is entirely
j voluntary.
Among the most important of the
j research programs being carried out
[ at Stanford Lane is the clinical in
j vestigation of penicillin. A tour of
the penicillin ward, to which pa-
I tients are brought lor treatment and
I observation iwthout charge, was con
ducted by Dr. Arthur L. Bloomfield.
New Production Method
As a sidelight it is interesting to
j note that it is Dr. Charles E. Clifton,
professor of bacteriology, working
here on campus, who has developed
a new means for producing penicillin
in quantity, which has thus far been
; the crux of the penicillin problem.
Dr. Thomas Addis, recently elected
! to the National Academy of Science,
j has been working under the Com
j mittee on Medical Research of the
j O.S.R.D. in Washington for a year
I and a halt on another research prob
lem important to the war effort
artificial blood substitutes. The im
-1 portance of developing forms into
I which blood can be easily trans
ferred and safely administered is ob
vious in this day of saving lives
j through blood plasma.
I Valley Fever
A press tour also included a view
ing of Dr. Charles Smith's research
on coccidioidomycosis or "Valley
Fever," a disease which has since its
discovery here (it was first believed
to be restricted only to the San Joa
j quin Valley, hence its name) been
j under investigation by Stanford men.
It has now been shown that, though
the fatal form of the disease is very
| rare, it is a relatively common non
fatal illness throughout the arid re
gions of California, West Texas,
| Southern Utah. Southern Nevada,
and most extensively of all in Cen
tral and Southern Arizona.
