A.s the last week of Daily pufali
j cation lor the quarter rolls around,
: we look aghast at the prospects of
I next quarter's sports department,
j The awful fact stares us in the face:
! Not one menil i r of the sports staff
j which has served you through the
I past three quarters will remain.
Uncle Sain has his eye on Joe Zukin
and Sports Editor Roger Cortr.an,
while Dick Block will soon be sailing
| forts with the Merchant Marine. Dick
I Bartle is also leaving, and John Figg-
I Hoblyn and Yours Truly are va
cating for the summer. Five from
: live leaves a big round zero. Perhaps
j a likely prospect will be found among
the new freshmen, or some of you
budding journalists who have never
found the time will drop in at the
Daily oflice. Who knows? You might
j turn up as summer quarter's sports
I editor.

After about two months of play,
the Pacific Coast League now looks
like a hopeless muddle. Everything
was nice and straight until Sacra
mento came alon" and started beat
j ing the hide off the best teams in the
league. The Sad Sacs have already
taken a series from Seattle, and as we
| write this they have just finished
whipping the pants off the Seals. Un
like any other team in the league.
I they are improving.
We still say that Seattle is going
j to win the pennant. The Suds' great
I advantage is their pitching staff,
| which consists ol no less than 10
II men, most of them veterans.
