the track events to give them a good
50-point edge on the field.

top the field of high jumpers, win
ning that event with a jurnp of (J feet
4 inches. This was three inches

himself to the 440-yard dash, won
i'.at event, as usual, to help the San
Franciscans along in the track events.
it was the Olympic Club's first
team victory of the season under the
capable mentorship of Dink Temple
ton, former Stanford track coach, in

most of the other meets of the season
they have placed second to the
mighty Trojans of USC.
