# Holsti Reviews Years Of Diplomatic Service
## 
### 
To the, •
Honourable Herbert C. Hoover
President of (he American
Food Administration
Hotel Crillon,
Paris
Sir,
"Since the beginning of last De
cember I have had the honour sev
eral times in letters and verbally to
express to you the assurances of the
great gratitude of the Finnish people
for your invaluable assistance in con
nection with the relief work in Fin
land."
This is the beginning of a letter
that came to Herbert Hoover's office
in Paris in 1919 and now holds a
place of honor in the Hoover War
Library.
The letter is signed very simply,
Rudolf Hoisti.
When he wrote that letter to his
friend Herbert Hoover. Rudolf Holsti
was Foreign Minister of Finland. He
is now an acting professor in Stan
lord's political science department.
Undoubtedly it was his close
friendship for Herbert Hoover more
than any other factor that brought
him to Stanford, a friendship that
dates back to December 1918.
Only (he Beginning
Dr. Holsti was in London then, ar
ranging for the food that Finland so
desperately needed at the end of the
war. But in spite of the Finnish ships
that were even then helping the Brit
ish government, he met opposition
everywhere.
He was successful only after Hoo

! ver arrived in London. Within two
hours of their meeting, Mr. Hoover
promised immediate aid for Finland.
That was only the beginning of their
long acquaintance.
Dr. Holsti spoke not only of his
own friendship for Hoover, but that
of Finland. "The entire Finnish na
tion considers him one of the greatest
friends they have ever had," he de
clared.
He tells of Hoover's visit to Fin
| land in 1938 when he was received
j with wild acclaim. Among the many
honors he received, one was a degree
j a$ Doctor ol Philosophy from the
! University of Helsinki.
J Solemn Occasion
Professor Holsti recalls the occa-
I sion willi a smile. "It was a solemn,
! old fashioned ceremony, during
j which Mr. Hoover was presented
with a sword. When it was all over.
Mr. Hoover said jokingly that as
Commander in Chief of the American
fighting forces, he had never had a
sword, but to get one he had to come
j to one of the most peaceful countries
in the world to receive it from a uni
! versify."
With his great admiration for Mr.
Hoover, it was small wonder that
Dr. Holsti, retiring from the diplo
matic service in IS4O to come to
America, should think of Stanford.
1 He had lectured here before, during
the summer of 1930, and he still
j remembered "the great hospitality
that Mr. and Mrs. Hoover always ex-
I tended to us."
So in 1940 he accepted a post at

1 Stanford with the political science
department.
In the intervening years from 1918
to the present, Dr. Holsti gained a
great knowledge of political science
at first hand. Member ol the Finnish
Parliament. Finnish Diplomatic Pep
] resentative to London and later to
! the Peace Conference at Pari:- in
1919. Minister for Foreign Affairs in
| four different cabinets, Finnish Min
] ister to Estonia and Latvia, Minister
i to Switzerland since 1927. these were
J only a few of his inanv duties.
I But his most important one was as
a delegate to the League of Nations.
In 1922 he attended his first meetin
of the Leanue Assembly, and every
| subsequent meeting until the last one
j in 1939.
League Not Dead
"It is wrong to say that the League
'of Nations i.s dead, he stated ein
' phatically. To prove his point he
pointed out that some 45 states of the
world are still members, proving
| their belief in it. He showed a list of
! the League's expenditures from 1942
j and 1943 which showed its work in
many fields.
The League has been greatly re
duced he admitted. The Court of In
ternational Justice had 'o move from
the Hague to Switzerland, and sev
| oral of the League's offices have
i moved to the American continent.
He believes with Anthony Eden,
| "The old League of Nations did not
; fail because its machinery was
faulty. "It failed. Professor Holsti
j said, "because the stales who were
! members of the League would not
| take advantage of the opportunities
lat their disposal. Their anxiety to
! preserve their national sovereignty
| went too far, and they sacrificed the
fundamental principle of collective
j security.
Other Successes
"Furthermore," he stated, "the
: League failed only in its main task,
j that of keeping the peace. It failed
| when Japan attacked China, Italy
made war on Abyssinia, and Ger
many invaded Poland.
"In all other respects the League
was a great success." He goes on ,to
tell of other little-publicized but vital
activities of the League, such as their
work toward public health and ad
vancing international law.
When asked, "Would it be best to
continue the League of Nations'.'" Dr.
Holsti answered that he believes a
league of some sort will be necessary
; after the war is over. "I don't care,"
| he said, "whether the old League is
| established in full power and de
veloped, or whether there is a new
j world organization. But it must have
two qualities. It must be universal,
| and it must be stronger and more
| able to maintain peace."

To the, •
Honourable Herbert C. Hoover
President of (he American
Food Administration
Hotel Crillon,
Paris
Sir,
"Since the beginning of last De
cember I have had the honour sev
eral times in letters and verbally to
express to you the assurances of the
great gratitude of the Finnish people
for your invaluable assistance in con
nection with the relief work in Fin
land."
This is the beginning of a letter
that came to Herbert Hoover's office
in Paris in 1919 and now holds a
place of honor in the Hoover War
Library.
The letter is signed very simply,
Rudolf Hoisti.
When he wrote that letter to his
friend Herbert Hoover. Rudolf Holsti
was Foreign Minister of Finland. He
is now an acting professor in Stan
lord's political science department.
Undoubtedly it was his close
friendship for Herbert Hoover more
than any other factor that brought
him to Stanford, a friendship that
dates back to December 1918.
Only (he Beginning
Dr. Holsti was in London then, ar
ranging for the food that Finland so
desperately needed at the end of the
war. But in spite of the Finnish ships
that were even then helping the Brit
ish government, he met opposition
everywhere.
He was successful only after Hoo

! ver arrived in London. Within two
hours of their meeting, Mr. Hoover
promised immediate aid for Finland.
That was only the beginning of their
long acquaintance.
Dr. Holsti spoke not only of his
own friendship for Hoover, but that
of Finland. "The entire Finnish na
tion considers him one of the greatest
friends they have ever had," he de
clared.
He tells of Hoover's visit to Fin
| land in 1938 when he was received
j with wild acclaim. Among the many
honors he received, one was a degree
j a$ Doctor ol Philosophy from the
! University of Helsinki.
J Solemn Occasion
Professor Holsti recalls the occa-
I sion willi a smile. "It was a solemn,
! old fashioned ceremony, during
j which Mr. Hoover was presented
with a sword. When it was all over.
Mr. Hoover said jokingly that as
Commander in Chief of the American
fighting forces, he had never had a
sword, but to get one he had to come
j to one of the most peaceful countries
in the world to receive it from a uni
! versify."
With his great admiration for Mr.
Hoover, it was small wonder that
Dr. Holsti, retiring from the diplo
matic service in IS4O to come to
America, should think of Stanford.
1 He had lectured here before, during
the summer of 1930, and he still
j remembered "the great hospitality
that Mr. and Mrs. Hoover always ex-
I tended to us."
So in 1940 he accepted a post at

1 Stanford with the political science
department.
In the intervening years from 1918
to the present, Dr. Holsti gained a
great knowledge of political science
at first hand. Member ol the Finnish
Parliament. Finnish Diplomatic Pep
] resentative to London and later to
! the Peace Conference at Pari:- in
1919. Minister for Foreign Affairs in
| four different cabinets, Finnish Min
] ister to Estonia and Latvia, Minister
i to Switzerland since 1927. these were
J only a few of his inanv duties.
I But his most important one was as
a delegate to the League of Nations.
In 1922 he attended his first meetin

J Solemn Occasion
Professor Holsti recalls the occa-
I sion willi a smile. "It was a solemn,
! old fashioned ceremony, during
j which Mr. Hoover was presented
with a sword. When it was all over.
Mr. Hoover said jokingly that as
Commander in Chief of the American
fighting forces, he had never had a
sword, but to get one he had to come
j to one of the most peaceful countries
in the world to receive it from a uni
! versify."
With his great admiration for Mr.
Hoover, it was small wonder that
Dr. Holsti, retiring from the diplo
matic service in IS4O to come to
America, should think of Stanford.
1 He had lectured here before, during
the summer of 1930, and he still
j remembered "the great hospitality
that Mr. and Mrs. Hoover always ex-
I tended to us."
So in 1940 he accepted a post at

1 Stanford with the political science
department.
In the intervening years from 1918
to the present, Dr. Holsti gained a
great knowledge of political science
at first hand. Member ol the Finnish
Parliament. Finnish Diplomatic Pep

1919. Minister for Foreign Affairs in

J only a few of his inanv duties.
I But his most important one was as
a delegate to the League of Nations.
In 1922 he attended his first meetin
of the Leanue Assembly, and every
| subsequent meeting until the last one
j in 1939.
League Not Dead
"It is wrong to say that the League
'of Nations i.s dead, he stated ein
' phatically. To prove his point he
pointed out that some 45 states of the
world are still members, proving
| their belief in it. He showed a list of
! the League's expenditures from 1942
j and 1943 which showed its work in
many fields.
The League has been greatly re
duced he admitted. The Court of In

i moved to the American continent.
He believes with Anthony Eden,
| "The old League of Nations did not
; fail because its machinery was
faulty. "It failed. Professor Holsti
j said, "because the stales who were

| went too far, and they sacrificed the
fundamental principle of collective

Other Successes
"Furthermore," he stated, "the
: League failed only in its main task,
j that of keeping the peace. It failed
| when Japan attacked China, Italy
made war on Abyssinia, and Ger
many invaded Poland.
"In all other respects the League
was a great success." He goes on ,to
tell of other little-publicized but vital
activities of the League, such as their
work toward public health and ad
vancing international law.
When asked, "Would it be best to
continue the League of Nations'.'" Dr.
Holsti answered that he believes a
league of some sort will be necessary
; after the war is over. "I don't care,"
| he said, "whether the old League is
| established in full power and de
veloped, or whether there is a new
j world organization. But it must have
two qualities. It must be universal,
| and it must be stronger and more
| able to maintain peace."
To the, •
Honourable Herbert C. Hoover
President of (he American
Food Administration
Hotel Crillon,
Paris
Sir,
"Since the beginning of last De
cember I have had the honour sev
eral times in letters and verbally to
express to you the assurances of the
great gratitude of the Finnish people
for your invaluable assistance in con
nection with the relief work in Fin
land."
This is the beginning of a letter
that came to Herbert Hoover's office
in Paris in 1919 and now holds a
place of honor in the Hoover War
Library.
The letter is signed very simply,
Rudolf Hoisti.
When he wrote that letter to his
friend Herbert Hoover. Rudolf Holsti
was Foreign Minister of Finland. He
is now an acting professor in Stan
lord's political science department.
Undoubtedly it was his close
friendship for Herbert Hoover more
than any other factor that brought
him to Stanford, a friendship that
dates back to December 1918.
Only (he Beginning
Dr. Holsti was in London then, ar
ranging for the food that Finland so
desperately needed at the end of the
war. But in spite of the Finnish ships
that were even then helping the Brit
ish government, he met opposition
everywhere.
He was successful only after Hoo

! ver arrived in London. Within two
hours of their meeting, Mr. Hoover
promised immediate aid for Finland.
That was only the beginning of their
long acquaintance.
Dr. Holsti spoke not only of his
own friendship for Hoover, but that
of Finland. "The entire Finnish na
tion considers him one of the greatest
friends they have ever had," he de
clared.
He tells of Hoover's visit to Fin
| land in 1938 when he was received
j with wild acclaim. Among the many
honors he received, one was a degree
