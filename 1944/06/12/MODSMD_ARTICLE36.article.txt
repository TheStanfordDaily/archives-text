# Vocational Aid Given By interest Tests
## 
### JANET OSSMAN 
Besides preparing students to take jobs with which their abilities coincide,
Stanford tries to direct its students into fields in which their interests lie.
One of the most reliable guides for vocational interests is the Strong Voca
tional Test which was prepared through the research of Edward Strong,
professor of psychology at Stanford.
Through psychology studies it has been shown that one-third ol the

men and women who have been in
cluded in the survey, are dissatisfied
in their work. Dr. Strong said that
he would like to believe that there is
a job in which everyone would be
happy.
Interest Tests
His tests are not designed to meas
ure one's ability in a certain occu
pation, but to see whether or not
one's interests agree with those of
successful men and women in a given
occupation. If your interests agree,
then you would probably be happy
in the environment of that occupa
tion because you would be doing the
things you like.
According to Dr. Strong, there is
very little change in interests be
tween the ages of 20 and 55. Students
may take the Vocational Test, how
ever. from the time they are 17 or 18.
If interests lie in the direction of
social work, they may not appear at
the age of 17. but on the other hand,
mechanical interests show at a fairly
early age.
Use Stores As Hunches
il is Dr. Strong's hope that students
will take the tests and use the scores
as hunches, as il is impossible to i
explore the whole vocational field. \
He advies taking courses in the lines j
of high vocational scores along with j
other college courses. I
In this way you can see if you like !
a vocation which might otherwise be
unknown to you. High scores can
also suggest similar jobs, or com
binations can be made of vocations
rated highly on the test scores.
Tests at Ad Building
The vocational tests are available
at the Administration building and
after they are scored, they can be
taken to the Dean of Men or the I
Dean of Women for further advice. |
l)i Strong emphasized the aim of I
his work is to find careers for young I
people in harmony with their inter- j
ests. which are fairly well established !
by their sophomore or junior year j
in college. There are exceptions, but
most students' blanks will look fairly j
well alike five years apart.
