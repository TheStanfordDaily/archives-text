# 'School for Husbands' Judged Subtle Comedy

### 
4 \Sc! :00l lor Husbands." from Philip Buck's charming introduction to
Candy Taylor's closing advice to the ladies of the audience to send their
| spouses to her school for husbands, was enjoyable and well done. What
I production of the Stanford Players isn't excellent entertainment?
Presenting a basically 17th century play written in poetry, to a 20th

J century audience is a difficult matter. H
j F. Cowles Strickland, director, de- j
| serves a great deal of credit for the J
success of the show, for his cast i
j handled the rhyming lines as if they
j had been prose, and the occasional
j slowness of sequence in the plot was
j made up for by the subtle comedy in
j the stage movements which accom
panied the lines.
! Bad Tempered Buck
The scene of the play was a street '
1 in Paris, 1661. The costumes of the i
j French fashionables of the period j
j completed the atmosphere of Louis
XlV's Paris. Mr. Buck's charaeter
| ization of the bad tempered old man
who kept his ward. Isabelle. played
I by Candy Taylor, in closely guarded
seclusion until she decided to marry
! him, was excellent.
Jane Spaulding as the maid, Li
sette. and Mr. Strickland as Ergaste,
the valet, provided good comedy en
tertainment. but Chester Barker and
Doctor Morgan'as Solomon and Soc
rates in the dream interlude brought
| the best response from the first
; night audience.
Good Horn Blowing
The 17th century music sung by
the players was lilting in keeping
j with the theme, and special praise
| should go to the participants in the
; carnival scene, for horn blowing,
harlequins and confetti on a stage
often appear to be forced gaiety, but
the carnival actors were so realistic
; that they put the audience in a
j festive mood.
Miss Taylor, as Isabelle, the mis
treated young girl, worked her fem
inine wiles charmingly upon Sgan
arelle and won her freedom to marry
her lover Valere, Harlen M. Adams.
Miss Taylor and Mr. Adams sang
several good duets. The dancing in
the dream interlude also deserves
special note for Olgadale Phillips, and
Beta Popper as Athenee won singing
' honors of the evening.
Technical mistakes were the only
inharmonious notes in the latest
Stanford Players' success. Everyone
connected with the show deserves
! praise. It was an interesting, enjoy
able production. Black
