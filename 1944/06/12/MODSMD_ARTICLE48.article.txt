# Ventura Adopts Mysterious, Lovable Willie
## 
### 
Things may be tough all over, but
lile for Willie consists simply of a
routine of eating, sleeping, purring,
chasing birds, and sitting on Cusa
Ventura's door-step. To all outward
appearances he might be just an
other cat, but he's something special
to the girls at Ventura who have
adopted him. For Willie cold ham
burgers are removed trom Lagunita's
dining room, and innumerable bottles
of milk wander into the refrigerator.
The reason that Willie decided to
honor Ventura with his presence
(other than that he was hungry) re
mains a mystery. After lingering
mournfully outside the windows of
the studious Ventura girls without
success, happiness came one day
when the girls took compassion uj.x>n
the waif, and began bringing him
food of all varieties. It is just as well
that Willie isn't particular about his
diet, for lie's led many different
things, salvaged from the evening's
dinner.
(.'ailed llini llosie"
Before the girls knew Willie very
well, they called him "Rosie" because
they found him under a rose bush,
but the dispute over his sex was at
last, settled, and the name of Willie
was deemed more appropriate for
him. According to his Ventura
friends. Willie possesses abnormal in
telligence and a personality which is
not found in ordinary cats.
Willie's manners are not, however,
above reproach, for lie has acquired
the habit of gulping his food, and
consequently, he is beseiged with
hiccoughs after eating. Even worse,
he sometimes belches after a meal.
He has been known to claw the kind

hearted girls who leed him, in his
haste to get at the proffered food.

In order to make his coat healthier
his diet has been supplemented by
fish and raw eggs. Some inconsider
ate Ventura girl nearly cost Willie
his coat, for she stole five eggs from
the ice box which had been reserved
for him. Willie hopes that such con
duct won't be repeated.

was deemed more appropriate for
him. According to his Ventura
friends. Willie possesses abnormal in
telligence and a personality which is
not found in ordinary cats.
Willie's manners are not, however,
above reproach, for lie has acquired
the habit of gulping his food, and
consequently, he is beseiged with
hiccoughs after eating. Even worse,
he sometimes belches after a meal.
He has been known to claw the kind

hearted girls who leed him, in his
haste to get at the proffered food.
