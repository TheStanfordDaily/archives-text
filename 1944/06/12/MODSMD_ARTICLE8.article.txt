## 
### 
With the deadline for the cnlist-
I ment of young men in the Enlisted
Reserve Corps for participation in
the Army's Specialized Training Re
serve Program near at hand, Col.
John R. Eden, Commandant at Stan
ford University, announced that he
is prepared to answer any inquiries
as to details of the program. An in
j crease in the enrollment of Stanford's
; Army Specialized Training Reserve
Program is expected at the start of
' the term on July ]0 as a result of
! present enlistments.
Colonel Eden stated that the bene
| fits of the program will be lost to all
i (hose eligible candidates who fail to
i take advantage of the opportunity to
I enlist by July 1.
Those who are eligible are any of
; the young men who passed the
| March 15, 1944 Army-Navy Qualify
ing Test and received notices from
the Army that they may elect enlist
ments. They must be between the
ages of 17 years and 0 months and
17 years and 9 months on July 1.
[ Over 100 Stanford students took the
I test.
; Interest Apparent
"A marked interest in the reserve
program has been apparent," Colonel
i Eden stated today, "but that interest
| has been tempered with some uncer
| tainty and reluctance because of lack
of information on the part of candi
dates and their parents as to the full
benefits and advantages of the re
j serve program, its scope, and its ob
ligations. We now have received the
new curricula the War Department
has set for the expanded program,
I and I will be glad to give any who
I inquire information regarding the
college courses open under these
curricula or regarding any other fca
| tures of the program."
Colonel Eden emphasized that the
reserve program affords a chance for
successful candidates to receive un
j interrupted education at government
! expense during the uncertain period
1 between high school graduation and
induction into the services.
New Program
Under the new program at least
I six months of academic training in
I selected colleges are assured for a
j successful candidate who is not over
17 years 9 months old on July 1, and
at least nine months of academic
training is assured for a successful
candidate who is not over 17 years 6
months old on that date.
"Curricula are divided into 12-
week terms. Common to most cur
ricula are courses in mathematics,
physics, history, English, and geog
| raphy. The curricula differ in that
some include engineering subjects,
I while others include special work in
chemistry and biology, or in foreign
j area and languages.
"Determination of the field of study
! to which the candidate is assigned
i will be made by the War Department
in collaboration with the faculties of
: participating institutions.
