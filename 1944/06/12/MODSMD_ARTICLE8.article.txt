; Interest Apparent
"A marked interest in the reserve
program has been apparent," Colonel
i Eden stated today, "but that interest
| has been tempered with some uncer
| tainty and reluctance because of lack
of information on the part of candi
dates and their parents as to the full
benefits and advantages of the re
j serve program, its scope, and its ob
ligations. We now have received the
new curricula the War Department
has set for the expanded program,
I and I will be glad to give any who
I inquire information regarding the
college courses open under these
curricula or regarding any other fca
| tures of the program."
Colonel Eden emphasized that the
reserve program affords a chance for

j interrupted education at government
! expense during the uncertain period
1 between high school graduation and
induction into the services.

ricula are courses in mathematics,
physics, history, English, and geog

some include engineering subjects,
I while others include special work in
chemistry and biology, or in foreign
j area and languages.
"Determination of the field of study
! to which the candidate is assigned
i will be made by the War Department
in collaboration with the faculties of
: participating institutions.
"Reservists will be assigned to
courses at the highest, level of their
capabilities. Those who have already
had one or more terms of college
work will be placed in appropriate
courses.
"The A.S.T. Reserve Program rep
resents a major supply source for the
advanced training of the Army Spe
| cialized Training Program.
"Prior to graduation from the Re
j serve Program, the Reservist is given
I special aptitude tests and interviews
I to determine his fitness for entry into
the A.S.T.P. after his call to active
duty and the completion of his basic
miitlary training.
"Following basic military training
the number selected for advanced
training is determined by the number
of vacancies existing at any one time
in the A.S.T.P.
Advanced Training
"Advanced training is scheduled in
the following fields: pre-niedicine,
prc-dentistry, medicine, dentistry,
engineering (various branches), and
foreign areas and languages.

sible, but many factors prevent any
guarantee in this respect."

John R. Eden, Commandant at Stan
ford University, announced that he
is prepared to answer any inquiries
as to details of the program. An in
j crease in the enrollment of Stanford's
; Army Specialized Training Reserve
Program is expected at the start of
' the term on July ]0 as a result of
! present enlistments.
Colonel Eden stated that the bene
| fits of the program will be lost to all
i (hose eligible candidates who fail to
i take advantage of the opportunity to
I enlist by July 1.
Those who are eligible are any of

ing Test and received notices from
the Army that they may elect enlist
ments. They must be between the
ages of 17 years and 0 months and

[ Over 100 Stanford students took the
I test.
; Interest Apparent
"A marked interest in the reserve
program has been apparent," Colonel
i Eden stated today, "but that interest
| has been tempered with some uncer
| tainty and reluctance because of lack
of information on the part of candi
dates and their parents as to the full
benefits and advantages of the re
j serve program, its scope, and its ob
ligations. We now have received the
new curricula the War Department
has set for the expanded program,
I and I will be glad to give any who
I inquire information regarding the
college courses open under these
curricula or regarding any other fca
| tures of the program."
Colonel Eden emphasized that the
reserve program affords a chance for
successful candidates to receive un
j interrupted education at government
! expense during the uncertain period
1 between high school graduation and
induction into the services.
New Program
Under the new program at least
I six months of academic training in
I selected colleges are assured for a
j successful candidate who is not over
17 years 9 months old on July 1, and
at least nine months of academic
training is assured for a successful
candidate who is not over 17 years 6
months old on that date.
"Curricula are divided into 12-
week terms. Common to most cur
ricula are courses in mathematics,
physics, history, English, and geog
| raphy. The curricula differ in that
some include engineering subjects,
I while others include special work in
chemistry and biology, or in foreign
j area and languages.
"Determination of the field of study
! to which the candidate is assigned
i will be made by the War Department
in collaboration with the faculties of
: participating institutions.
"Reservists will be assigned to
courses at the highest, level of their
capabilities. Those who have already
had one or more terms of college
work will be placed in appropriate
courses.
"The A.S.T. Reserve Program rep
resents a major supply source for the
advanced training of the Army Spe

j serve Program, the Reservist is given
I special aptitude tests and interviews
I to determine his fitness for entry into
the A.S.T.P. after his call to active

miitlary training.
"Following basic military training
the number selected for advanced
training is determined by the number
of vacancies existing at any one time
in the A.S.T.P.
Advanced Training
"Advanced training is scheduled in
the following fields: pre-niedicine,

as to details of the program. An in
j crease in the enrollment of Stanford's
; Army Specialized Training Reserve
Program is expected at the start of
' the term on July ]0 as a result of
! present enlistments.
Colonel Eden stated that the bene
| fits of the program will be lost to all
i (hose eligible candidates who fail to
i take advantage of the opportunity to
I enlist by July 1.
Those who are eligible are any of
; the young men who passed the
| March 15, 1944 Army-Navy Qualify
ing Test and received notices from
the Army that they may elect enlist
ments. They must be between the
ages of 17 years and 0 months and
17 years and 9 months on July 1.
[ Over 100 Stanford students took the
I test.
; Interest Apparent
"A marked interest in the reserve
program has been apparent," Colonel
i Eden stated today, "but that interest
| has been tempered with some uncer
| tainty and reluctance because of lack
of information on the part of candi
dates and their parents as to the full
benefits and advantages of the re
j serve program, its scope, and its ob
ligations. We now have received the
new curricula the War Department
has set for the expanded program,
I and I will be glad to give any who
I inquire information regarding the
college courses open under these
curricula or regarding any other fca
| tures of the program."
Colonel Eden emphasized that the
reserve program affords a chance for
successful candidates to receive un
j interrupted education at government
! expense during the uncertain period
1 between high school graduation and
induction into the services.
New Program
Under the new program at least
I six months of academic training in
I selected colleges are assured for a
j successful candidate who is not over
17 years 9 months old on July 1, and
at least nine months of academic
training is assured for a successful
candidate who is not over 17 years 6
months old on that date.
"Curricula are divided into 12-
week terms. Common to most cur
ricula are courses in mathematics,
physics, history, English, and geog
| raphy. The curricula differ in that
some include engineering subjects,
I while others include special work in
chemistry and biology, or in foreign
j area and languages.
"Determination of the field of study
! to which the candidate is assigned
i will be made by the War Department
in collaboration with the faculties of
: participating institutions.
"Reservists will be assigned to
courses at the highest, level of their
capabilities. Those who have already
had one or more terms of college
work will be placed in appropriate
courses.
"The A.S.T. Reserve Program rep
resents a major supply source for the
advanced training of the Army Spe
| cialized Training Program.
"Prior to graduation from the Re
j serve Program, the Reservist is given
I special aptitude tests and interviews
I to determine his fitness for entry into
the A.S.T.P. after his call to active
duty and the completion of his basic
miitlary training.
"Following basic military training
the number selected for advanced
training is determined by the number
of vacancies existing at any one time
in the A.S.T.P.
Advanced Training
"Advanced training is scheduled in
the following fields: pre-niedicine,
prc-dentistry, medicine, dentistry,
engineering (various branches), and
foreign areas and languages.
"II is the policy to assign students
to schools as near their home as pos
sible, but many factors prevent any
guarantee in this respect."
Colonel Eden stated that Ist. Lieut.
Keith L. McCoy, of the Stanford A.S.
j P.P. staff, will be in the lounge at En
| cina Hall on the Campus at 5:15 this
afternoon to conduct a round-table
