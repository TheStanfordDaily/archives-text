# HAND TO HAND FIGHTING FOR CARENTAN
## Counterattack at Caen; Ten-Mile Advance Through Flooded Land Takes Lison 
### 
ALLIED SUPREME HQ., LONDON, Monday, June 12 (UP). —
American troops drove Sunday to points less than 12 miles from
Cherbourg and in a hand-to-hand battle stormed Carentan at the
base of the Cotentin peninsula where a great armored battle,
perhaps signifying the start of the first major German counter
attack, broke out north and west of Caen.
In a spectacular advance at the center of the beachhead, Amer
ican troops threw bridges across the inundated flat land and ad
vanced inland 10 miles, capturing the village of Lison and ef
fecting a new junction with Anglo-Canadian forces on the east
flank with the support of a tremendous three-way bombardment
from land, sea, and air.
The British had captured Tilly on the Seulleus River, eight
miles south of Bayeux, and held it against fierce counter-attacks,
throwing the Germans back on a secondary line across the
stream. It was from this line that the enemy was now apparently
launching his first all-out counter-attack.
The new gains put all the vital landing beaches beyond the
range of German artillery and"the phase of securing a beach
head is drawing to a close," it was officially stated at Gen. Dwight
D. Eisenhower's headguarters.
Had German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel launched a con
centrated counter-attack during the first two days of the invasion,
when bad weather put the unloading of the reinforcements and
supplies behind schedule, he might have thrown the Allies back
into the sea, qualied observers said.
The Allied position now is "rapidly solidifying," however,
and on the American west flank the Americans were striking
hard for the port of Cherbourg where a deep roadstead can ac
commodate the largest ocean liners. A tank and infantry spear
head drove Sunday to the outskirts of Montebourg, 14 miles
south of Cherbourg, where a street battle began. Then armored
patrols swung around northeast of the town by-passing it and
raced to positions close to the coast less than 12 miles from the
port, official advices said.
It was emphasized that much hard fighting might lie ahead
along the remaining distance to Cherbourg, for the Germans are
dug in among natural defensive positions and reinforced by re
serves from the interior of France.
Southwest of Montebourg, where another column driving west
from the main peninsula railroad was threatening to cut off
Cherbourg, enemy counter-attacks were held, according to in
vasion communique number 12 from Gen. Dwight D. Eisen-
I hower's headquarters.
Henry P. Gorrell of the United Press reported from outside
Carentan that at 7:45 last night a hand-to-hand battle had been
| raging for hours in the outskirts of Carentan where the Germans
! still held a pivot in the coastal communications system. The
i German garrison, tough paratroopers, had turned down an ulti
! matum to surrender.

ALLIED SUPREME HQ., LONDON, Monday, June 12 (UP). —
American troops drove Sunday to points less than 12 miles from
Cherbourg and in a hand-to-hand battle stormed Carentan at the
base of the Cotentin peninsula where a great armored battle,
perhaps signifying the start of the first major German counter
attack, broke out north and west of Caen.
In a spectacular advance at the center of the beachhead, Amer
ican troops threw bridges across the inundated flat land and ad
vanced inland 10 miles, capturing the village of Lison and ef
fecting a new junction with Anglo-Canadian forces on the east
flank with the support of a tremendous three-way bombardment
from land, sea, and air.
The British had captured Tilly on the Seulleus River, eight
miles south of Bayeux, and held it against fierce counter-attacks,
throwing the Germans back on a secondary line across the
stream. It was from this line that the enemy was now apparently
launching his first all-out counter-attack.
The new gains put all the vital landing beaches beyond the
range of German artillery and"the phase of securing a beach
head is drawing to a close," it was officially stated at Gen. Dwight
D. Eisenhower's headguarters.
Had German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel launched a con
centrated counter-attack during the first two days of the invasion,
when bad weather put the unloading of the reinforcements and
supplies behind schedule, he might have thrown the Allies back
into the sea, qualied observers said.
The Allied position now is "rapidly solidifying," however,
and on the American west flank the Americans were striking
hard for the port of Cherbourg where a deep roadstead can ac
commodate the largest ocean liners. A tank and infantry spear
head drove Sunday to the outskirts of Montebourg, 14 miles
south of Cherbourg, where a street battle began. Then armored
patrols swung around northeast of the town by-passing it and
raced to positions close to the coast less than 12 miles from the
port, official advices said.
It was emphasized that much hard fighting might lie ahead
along the remaining distance to Cherbourg, for the Germans are
dug in among natural defensive positions and reinforced by re
serves from the interior of France.
