## 
### 
Sales of war stamps and bonds in the Bond Booth yesterday, the first day
of the Fifth War Loan Drive, were very poor, announced Bev Andreuecetti,

stamp sales chairman. At 2 p.m. only four 25-cent stamps had been sold.
The Fifth War Loan is a drive being held all over the country this week,
and on campus a goal has been set at $25,000. This is considerably less than

the goal of $62,000 set for the
last quarter when $185,000 was col
lected.

main way that anyone on the home
front can back the invasion. The

stamp or a bond as they pass the
