# ALLIES TAKE CRENTAN!

ALLIED SUPREME HEADQUARTERS, LONDON. Tuesday,
| June 13 (UP).â€”American troops captured Carentan Monday after
! an all-night pitched battle and drove an 18-mile salient through
the middle of the French beachhead front as the Germans, threat
j ened with loss of their entire left flank, began rushing reinforce
ments to Cherbourg.
American mobile patrols already were probing the approaches
to Cherbourg in twin Yank columns near Valognes, only 10 miles
below the valuable port, after by-passing Montebourg on both
sides and repulsing a sharp enemy counter-attack.
Cherbourg was well within range of American "long Tom"
artillery. Allied warships, which in two days have carried out
the most concentrated bombardment in naval history, already
were blasting German positions around the port.
(A Berlin broadcast heard by NBC said that two new Allied
divisions had landed northeast of Cherbourg.)
A critical battle raged through its second day, meanwhile, on
the opposite flank of the fused 100-mile beachhead as elements
of three German tank divisions made trip-hammer counter-at
tacks. Tilly, on the Suelles River 10 miles west of Caen, had
changed hands three times in 24 hours. With tanks dueling in
the streets, the situation there was "obscure."
Waves of Allied planes assailed the German reinforcement
routes to Cherbourg from Brittany and a record number of 1400
American heavy bombers blasted enemy airfields and bridges in
Northern France. The Luftwaffe entered the battle in strength for
the first time, and in swirling dogfights 53 enemy planes were
! shot down at a cost of 39 of the Allies.
More than 10,000 enemy prisoners have been captured in
the first week of the invasion, it was announced, including 1800
bagged near Carentan by an American air-borne force one-tenth
their number. Between 14 and 15 German divisions, normally
nearly 240,000 men, have been massed against the beachhead,
but two of them, the 716 th and the 352 nd, have been so battered
they no longer are regarded as fit fighting units. German broad
casts asserted that nearly 500,000 Allied troops have been landed,
; which would mean that almost three-quarters of a million troops
I were locked in the first great battle for Western Europe.
A large delegation from the Allied inner circle inspected the
I beachhead area today, including Prime Minister Winston Church
ill, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the three top American
service chiefs: Generals George C. Marshall and Henry H. Arnold
and Admiral Ernest King.
