# Chappie To Sell By Subscription
## 
### 
Subscriptions to the summer
Chaparral may be made this week,
: by clipping one of the coupons which
will appear in the Daily Wednes
: day, Thursday and Friday and send
! iny or taking it, together with one
i genuine quarter, to the Chappie of-
I fice in the Press building.
The Chaparral will appear on
â–  campus during the summer quarter
as regularly, but this offer is being
| made to accommodate the many who
will not be here to buy one directly
from the stands.
The Chappie, under the new lead
j ership of Dick Duscoll, is already
j brewing great, hilarious ideas, ac
j cording to those who attended Sun
day's start meeting, so that the op
portunity to purchase one without
taking a trip on the Daylight will be
a welcome one.
