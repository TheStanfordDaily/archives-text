Now that it's just about that time to start cleaning up rooms
;efore finals roll around, it also means that the moment has come
o start "cleaning house" and sorting out records, music sheets,
nd perhaps any radios which would be too large or too old to
iack and ship home for the summer.
Since this is the Fifth War Loan week, War Board has also
lecided to conduct a second drive to obtain popular and classical
ecords for the Navy at Moffett Field to be used in their enter
tainment and recreation rooms.
The Palo Alto Chaptei* of the Red Cross has asked for dona
ions from students, and Carol Hurwitz, War Board chairman, has
lso suggested that all living group representatives scan their
orridors and halls when rooms are cleaned at the end of the
;uarter for discarded records. Students, as they look through
heir records and find those that they are tired of playing, should
irn these records in. The need is great, and the sacrifice is
mall. Ewell Sale
