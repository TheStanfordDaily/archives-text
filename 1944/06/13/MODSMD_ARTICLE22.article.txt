Li support of the Allied drive against the Atlantic wall, the
"tussians yesterday announced that the Red Army had begun a
Irive across the Karelian Isthmus designed to knock Finland out
){ the war and isolate approximately 100,000 Nazi troops in the
northern part of that country.
Yesterday the Red Army rolled forward across the isthmus
'•.bove Leningrad after cracking Finnish defenses along a 25-mile
[ront. They captured Kivenata, Rawola and more than 30 other
strong points.
The latest Russian communigue (and there is one being issued
as the paper goes to bed accounting for any new developments)
says that Soviet troops had already advanced from 12 to 25 miles
and indicated that they were moving forward everywhere along
the front in high gear.
General Govorov
The Red Army troops are under the command of Colonel
General Leonid Govorov, who lifted the siege of Leningrad.
Govorov launched the attack against the Finns Friday, just one
month after the fall of Sevastopol.
This one month was the longest the Russian front has been
devoid of action since the Germans started an offensive against
the Russians last July and finally wound up back in Berlin's front
yard.
The Soviet communique declares the Russian forces have cap
tured 82 towns and villages, including the rail junction of Terijoki,
27 air line miles northwest of Leningrad and 160 miles east of
the Finnish capital of Helsinki.
Russian Progress
Also captured, the bulletin declares, is Yappilya, described as
rm important strong point seven miles northeast of Terijoki.
Terijoki is situated on the Leningrad-Finnish border, and 70
miles east of the frontier established by the peace treaty which
ended the war betwen the two countries in the winter of 1939
3940.
The Soviets say the offensive is being supported not only by
masses of planes, but also by guns of the Russian Baltic fleet, and
heavy losses in men and materials are being inflicted on the
Finns.
Before the Atlantic wall the Germans are hard pressed by
American and British troops under the command of General
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Yanks Take Carentan
Monday the Yanks seized Carentan, stronghold at the narrow
neck of the Cherbourg peninsula, and other Yank forces plunged
18 miles inland as the Nazi line faltered under ceaseless Allied
pounding.
The Allies hammered out gains on all three sectors, supported
by 1,400 American heavy bombers blasting ten airfields and six
bridges in the greatest single aerial mission in the war.
Besides occupying the flood-gate-control city of Carentan, the
doughboys are within 14 miles of Cherbourg itself from the south
east, and are punching halfway across the jutting cape, cracking
the center of the Cherbourg line.
In the Italian theater of operations, Fifth Army troops have
captured Montefiascone, an important road junction near the
: hores of Lake Bolsena, and other columns pushing along the
Italian west coast are approaching Orbetello, 71 miles northwest
of Rome.
Eighth Army
Eighth Army columns advancing up both sides of the Tiber
River are nearing Bagno Reggio west of the river and Rieti east
of it.
In the mountainous central sector, Avezanno and its neighbor
ing villages have been occupied, while in the Adriatic sector all
the Germans have been cleared from the area south of the Pes
cara River and Allied troops have pushed ahead to maintain con
tact with the withdrawing Germans.
Grand Strategy
The overall grand strategy of the Allied High Command be
comes apparent. F.D.R. said last night that the Germans have
their backs to the wall- as a matter of fact, their backs to three
walls.
The Germans are being pounded on all sides by a furious
storm of right and might and from all indications they have little
or no umbrella to protect them from the rain of fury from the skies
that is daily becoming more promising.
The more we consider this grand strategy, the more we think
of how true the Disney de Seversky pictorial of air power be
comes. The Nazis are being pushed from four sides —we outdo
Roosevelt by one the fourth being the Eighth Air Force and
British bomber raid:?.

General Govorov
The Red Army troops are under the command of Colonel
General Leonid Govorov, who lifted the siege of Leningrad.
Govorov launched the attack against the Finns Friday, just one
month after the fall of Sevastopol.
This one month was the longest the Russian front has been
devoid of action since the Germans started an offensive against
the Russians last July and finally wound up back in Berlin's front
yard.
The Soviet communique declares the Russian forces have cap
tured 82 towns and villages, including the rail junction of Terijoki,
27 air line miles northwest of Leningrad and 160 miles east of
the Finnish capital of Helsinki.
Russian Progress
Also captured, the bulletin declares, is Yappilya, described as
rm important strong point seven miles northeast of Terijoki.
Terijoki is situated on the Leningrad-Finnish border, and 70
miles east of the frontier established by the peace treaty which
ended the war betwen the two countries in the winter of 1939
3940.
The Soviets say the offensive is being supported not only by
masses of planes, but also by guns of the Russian Baltic fleet, and
heavy losses in men and materials are being inflicted on the
Finns.
Before the Atlantic wall the Germans are hard pressed by
American and British troops under the command of General
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Yanks Take Carentan
Monday the Yanks seized Carentan, stronghold at the narrow
neck of the Cherbourg peninsula, and other Yank forces plunged
18 miles inland as the Nazi line faltered under ceaseless Allied
pounding.
The Allies hammered out gains on all three sectors, supported
by 1,400 American heavy bombers blasting ten airfields and six
bridges in the greatest single aerial mission in the war.
Besides occupying the flood-gate-control city of Carentan, the
doughboys are within 14 miles of Cherbourg itself from the south
east, and are punching halfway across the jutting cape, cracking
the center of the Cherbourg line.
In the Italian theater of operations, Fifth Army troops have
captured Montefiascone, an important road junction near the
: hores of Lake Bolsena, and other columns pushing along the
Italian west coast are approaching Orbetello, 71 miles northwest
of Rome.
Eighth Army
Eighth Army columns advancing up both sides of the Tiber
River are nearing Bagno Reggio west of the river and Rieti east
of it.
In the mountainous central sector, Avezanno and its neighbor
ing villages have been occupied, while in the Adriatic sector all
the Germans have been cleared from the area south of the Pes
cara River and Allied troops have pushed ahead to maintain con
tact with the withdrawing Germans.
Grand Strategy
The overall grand strategy of the Allied High Command be
comes apparent. F.D.R. said last night that the Germans have
their backs to the wall- as a matter of fact, their backs to three
walls.
The Germans are being pounded on all sides by a furious
storm of right and might and from all indications they have little
or no umbrella to protect them from the rain of fury from the skies
that is daily becoming more promising.
The more we consider this grand strategy, the more we think
of how true the Disney de Seversky pictorial of air power be
