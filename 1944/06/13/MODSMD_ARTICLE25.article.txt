# Raye, Grable, Crack Wise In 'Pin Up Girl' Flicker
## 
### 
Now playing ;it the Stanford Theater: PIN UP GIRL, starring Betty
Grable, Joe E. Brown, Martha Raye.
Grable's latest attempt looks to us like rank plagiarism, with several
numbers more than faintly resembling Stanford's own Spring Show.
Janice Shaughnessy is brunette and Grable is blonde, but that is about

the only apparent difference between
the Spring Show's "Rod, Hot, and I
Blue" and a similar number in "Pin i
Up Girl." Frankly we prefer the
more artistic former.
The story (if it can be called a
story) is a thinly veiled mixture of
Cinderella and boy meets girl, with
all the stock lovers' quarrels and
reunions.
Eugene Pallette provides the only
comedy, with Joe E. Brown letting
out his genius on only one good wise
crack. Buxom Martha Raye does I
her unsuccessful best 1o liven up the i
picture, and she deserves roses for
not deserting the sinking ship.
Decidedly the best number is a
beautifully executed skating se
quence centered around a red, white, j
and blue theme; and all done full
justice by the color photography.
As for the rest of the much her
alded numbers, the stage settings and j
.•ostumes are extravagant, and some
of the dancing is entertaining, if you
don't mind Miss Grable's legs almost |
kicking you in the teeth.
Anna Neagle in "The Yellow Ca
nary" provides some welcome acting
ability. As the internationally no
torious Sally Mateland she brings to
thes creen an involved tale of espi
onage and counter-espionage, in
trigue and counter-intrigue.
The whole picture is generously
sprinkled with more than the aver
age amount of gutteral German, good
practice for the language students.
A good evening of bowling will be
much more entertaining. ICMiertn
