# Greek Photos Come to Farm
## 
### 
An exhibition of 150 photographs
of Greece, under the title, "The
Beauty of Greece," is on exhibition
at the Stanford Art Gallery. This
exhibition, which includes many pic
tures of Greece never before pub
licly shown, has been brought to
Stanford University through the ef
forts of Dr. Bailey-Willis.
These photographs were shown at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York City earlier this season,
nad are now on a nationwide tour
sponsored by the Greek War Relief
Association and the American Fed
eration of Aits.
Selection of Photographs
The photographs were chosen from
more than 000 submitted. On the
jury making the final selection were
Charles Sheeler, nationally known
painet rand photographer; Andre
Marie Embiricos, Greek - American
ship-owner; Mrs. Byrtcne C. Ander
son, assistant director of the Greek
War Relief Association; Miss Gisela
Riehter, curator of the Department
of Greek and Roman Art at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art; and
Miss Amey Aldrich, a volunteer
worker with the Greek War Relief
Association.
More than half of the photographs
in the exhibit are new and are shown
here for the first time. However, no
effort has been made to include typi
cal news photographs showing the
horrors of war. Instead (he photo
graphs reflect the countryside, peo
ple, and architecture of peacetime
Greece. That so many new photo
graphs have been collected for this
show is surprising in view of the
hundreds of photographs of Greece
already published.
Unusual Pictures
Among some of the unusual photo
graphs in the current exhibition is
a picture of an outdoor seaside cafe
on the Greek coast, where the fish is
brought up from the water, not 10
feet away from where the customers
sit and is then cooked on the spot. A
photograph of a Greek house shows
that the modernistic type of archi
tecture, which we think of as a re
cent development, has actually been
in use in Greece for the last five
centuries.
A picture made inside a Greek
house, of pottery on a fireside shelf,
shows that modern pottery of Greece
follows exactly the traditional shape
and design of classic Greek pottery.
Many excellent views of the archi
tectural monuments of Greece are
also included in the show.
The exhibition will remain until
June 19. The art gallery is open
every day between 10 and 5 o'clock.
No admission charge.
