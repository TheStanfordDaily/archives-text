# Buchanan's Inmates Go Zoo-Crazy
## 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
The freshman women who period
ically chant "No pets in Roble" would
doubtless be floored at the siftht of
the menagerie that runs rampant in
the hallowed halls of Buchanan.
A certain resident assistant, sys
tematically tearing his hair out, told
your Daily reporter the following
story:
One of Buchanan's gayer blades,
yieldi ngto his fondness for honey
bees, imported not one, but two
swarms of buzzers one day last
month. After four or five of the in
mates were stung, including the cook,
the bees were forcibly removed from
the premises.
The animal instinct didn't end here,
however. Two of "the boys" brought
in seven snakes to run loose in their
chamber, feeding them with frogs
and grasshoppers. Needless to say,
when the rest of I he house discovered
the snakes they were disposed of
without quibbling.
Man' winged friend, the duck, was
Buchanan's last importation. On the
cooks' promise that he would cook a
duck dinner if given a duck, the
owner produced one genuine mallard
from the darkest corner of his closet.
One of the hungrier Buchanan men
promptly bought a half-interest for
50 cents. There was a humanitarian
in the crowd, however, who bought
controlling interest for GO cents, and
took the duck up to the lake and re
leased him.
The story probably does not end
here. We'll keep you posted.
