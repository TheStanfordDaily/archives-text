## SIDELINE SLANTS... 
### DICK BLOCK 
A liquidly cool voice of a silver
throated radio announcer is heard to
say nightly at 10 o'clock, before his
news broadcast, "What's going on in
the world?", and to him at this mo
ment wo answer, nothing, at least in
the sports world around these parts.
Intramural leagues have breathed
Btlicii' last for this quarter, except for
the playoffs between the lop softball
teams l'rom the Army and Civilians,
and before long it will be dead week,
so if this game is to be played, ar
rangements better be made hastily.
In Friday's Slanting Sidelines we
asked about Wyoming, the star
hurler for Lagun i t a. Wyoming
pitched a whopper of a good game
Thursday against the winless Bu
chanan men. Although our gal was
not on the winning side her pitching
would do any male proud.
Iloss Happenings
Strange things happen in horse
racing, and one of the more notable
Ripley's to happen lately took place
ill the Aqueduct mint last Saturday.
The featured race of (he day was
the Carter handicap with a $10,000
purse to the winner. When the shut
ter of the photo-finish camera was
released the developed picture
showed three horses, Brownie, Bos
.suet, and Wiat a Bit, at the finish line,
each with their noses at the same
point on the wire.
Incidentally, the total bet for the
day was $2,503,204, nice business,
and 25,386 fans withdrew from their
rainy day funds.
Pigskin Prcvue
Football news is starting to trickle
in, so we will relate some of the more
newsy items that have reached our
ears in the past few weeks.
A sadly weakened Pacific Coast
Conference inaugu-
Prated a three-day session yesterday
at Hood River, Ore. The main battle
seems to be between the graduate
managers and faculty representa
tives.
Prospects for this year are no bet
ter than '43 with the V-12 institu
tions. California, UCLA. USC. and
Washington fielding teams. In the
non-conference schools St. Mary's
should have a band and team as
usual, and Santa Clara will decline
competition once again. As for USF,
the Dons will most likely seek com
bat even if they have less material
than last year.
Princeton threw in the towel about
a month ago, and since then sports
writers have been intimidating the
New Jerseytes, because of the fact
that 1,200 V-12 trainees are stationed
there.
Sermon f'»r Today
Here we go again. If a university
believes that intercollegiate sports
should be dropped for the duration,
the fact remains that there must be
a fairly substantial reason for taking
such a step.
Taking Stanford as an example,
and most athletes of the sports col
umns do, the matter of forsaking the
gridiron, etc., was the students' idea.
The students and official.' did not dis
continue sports because they thought
we might come out on the short end
of too many games, but because they
the University would be
Pbusy expending its energy in the
pursuit of training men and women
to serve their country.
We are not condemning colleges
that have deemed intercollegiate
sports would go on during this per
iod,, certainly they must have mad
good reason to deny altering their
established policy.
Many facts are overlooked by the
important sports writers of the na
tion. Some of them seem to think of
every stereotyped sort of institution
as pictured by Universal and Warner
J} They do not seem to note that each
individual college has its own prob
lems, and each has different scholas
tic schedules. Until the time is
reached when they do the situation
will be constantly hostile.

Football news is starting to trickle
in, so we will relate some of the more
newsy items that have reached our
ears in the past few weeks.
A sadly weakened Pacific Coast
Conference inaugu-
Prated a three-day session yesterday
at Hood River, Ore. The main battle
seems to be between the graduate
managers and faculty representa
tives.
Prospects for this year are no bet
ter than '43 with the V-12 institu
tions. California, UCLA. USC. and
Washington fielding teams. In the
non-conference schools St. Mary's
should have a band and team as
usual, and Santa Clara will decline
competition once again. As for USF,
the Dons will most likely seek com
bat even if they have less material
than last year.
Princeton threw in the towel about
a month ago, and since then sports
writers have been intimidating the
New Jerseytes, because of the fact
that 1,200 V-12 trainees are stationed
there.
Sermon f'»r Today
Here we go again. If a university
believes that intercollegiate sports
should be dropped for the duration,
the fact remains that there must be
a fairly substantial reason for taking
such a step.
Taking Stanford as an example,
and most athletes of the sports col
umns do, the matter of forsaking the
gridiron, etc., was the students' idea.
The students and official.' did not dis
continue sports because they thought
we might come out on the short end
of too many games, but because they
the University would be
Pbusy expending its energy in the
pursuit of training men and women
to serve their country.
We are not condemning colleges
that have deemed intercollegiate
sports would go on during this per
iod,, certainly they must have mad
good reason to deny altering their
established policy.
Many facts are overlooked by the
important sports writers of the na
tion. Some of them seem to think of
every stereotyped sort of institution
as pictured by Universal and Warner
J} They do not seem to note that each
individual college has its own prob
lems, and each has different scholas
tic schedules. Until the time is
reached when they do the situation
will be constantly hostile.
A liquidly cool voice of a silver
throated radio announcer is heard to
say nightly at 10 o'clock, before his
news broadcast, "What's going on in
the world?", and to him at this mo
ment wo answer, nothing, at least in
the sports world around these parts.
Intramural leagues have breathed
Btlicii' last for this quarter, except for
the playoffs between the lop softball
teams l'rom the Army and Civilians,
and before long it will be dead week,
so if this game is to be played, ar
rangements better be made hastily.
In Friday's Slanting Sidelines we
asked about Wyoming, the star
hurler for Lagun i t a. Wyoming
pitched a whopper of a good game
Thursday against the winless Bu
chanan men. Although our gal was
not on the winning side her pitching
would do any male proud.
Iloss Happenings
Strange things happen in horse
racing, and one of the more notable
Ripley's to happen lately took place
ill the Aqueduct mint last Saturday.
The featured race of (he day was
the Carter handicap with a $10,000
purse to the winner. When the shut
ter of the photo-finish camera was
released the developed picture
showed three horses, Brownie, Bos
.suet, and Wiat a Bit, at the finish line,
each with their noses at the same
point on the wire.
Incidentally, the total bet for the
