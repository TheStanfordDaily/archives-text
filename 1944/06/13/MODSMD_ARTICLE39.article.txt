Jeno Lener, Adolf Bailer, and Ca
bor Tejto, violinist, pianist, and
'cellist respectively, presented Sun
day evening in Memorial Hall a re
cital consisting of Schubert's B Flat
Trio, Beethoven's C Minor Trio, op.
3, No. 3, and Dvorak's "Duniky."
♦ * * *
Owing to a somewhat intractable
predilection for music in a narrow
range of forms, the contemporary
concertgoer remains unaware of
some of the old masters' greatest ef
forts. Had Schubert, for instance,
written his B Flat Trio for full or
chestra, it might today approach the
familiarity of his Unfinished Sym
phony. And it indeed might some
day be known, like certain other
chamber works, through transcrip
tion.
If transcribed for orchestra, how
ever, the B Flat Trio would gain by
its amplification in one direction but
lost in another. For usually no
medium except that for which a
composition was originally conceived
can accurately convey the atmos
phere and subleties which were in
tended.
Of course, one fact about chamber
compositions the old masters never
seemed to realize was that the length

of a work should be in proportion to
the size of the ensemble playing it.
If the B flat were a symphony, it is
of appropriate length; but as a trio,
it should be cut in half.
The large audience Sunday night
is one of a number of omens por
tending gradual breakdown of the
current isolationist attitude in music,
and a broadening appreciation of its
nether realms. —Cyclone Covey
