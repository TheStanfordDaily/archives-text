# Race Track Proves Pocketbook Strain
## 
### AVEY QUINN 
If you go to the races very much you will notice that unless the guys
have horses running or are employed at the track, they don't go to the races
every day.
Usually the first thing that they (the people I know) do is, look at the
•sports section in the morning paper to see what the "card" for the day is

like. If they know somd "hot nags
they usually decide to hit the track.
Racing Form
Upon deciding to go they buy a rac
ing form which tells the past per
formances of the horses which are to
run and their daily works.
A very important matter is to go
to the track in the right frame of
mind (i.e. you won't come home with
any of the money that you went up
with).
After arriving at the track with the
crowds of "race fans" you buy a
program, then rush off to the pad
dock to look over the horses. You
can tell which horse is the favorite
by looking at the crowds in front of
the various stalls in the paddock.
The stalls of the "long shots" are
usually relatively bare compared
with those of the favorites.
Characters Lead Horses
The handlers (who are true char
acters) lead the horses around the
paddock, then the stewards come in
and saddle the horses. Each jockey
has his own saddle and steward.
After the horses are saddled the
jocks come in for their last-minute
instructions from the owner and
trainer. The bugle blows and the
jocks mount and ride out onto the
track.
The people who were at the pad
dock then rush out to see if the odds
have changed. They then (I) kiss
their (my) dough good-bye, rush to
the mutuel window and exchange
that beautiful green stuff for an old
piece of paper.
At the Post
The horses enter the gate. Every
one is quiet until the bell rings and
''There they go." The stands rise
and start yelling for their nags as
the horses come into the stretch. The
yelling grows louder and louder.
When the results are flashed on the
board there are screams of excited
women mingled with yells of happy
men; also there are those who lost.
Some cuss the horse, some cuss the
jock, some cuss themselves, and some
just cuss. They tear up that old piece
of paper, and throw it away. If you
are lucky enough to hold a winning
ticket, that old piece of paper looks
like an autographed picture of Ann
Sheridan in a bathing suit.
If at the end of the day you go
home with more money than you
came with, you're lucky! But even
if you lose, you go home feeling tired
and thinking about the next day at
the. Meadows, when you'll make a
killing (I keep telling myself).
Track Characters
There are the track characters who
are quite varied personalities. There
are guys that go around selling tips
for enough dough to buy a beer. You
see bums that go around the grounds
looking for tickets that people may
have dropped—or thrown away by
mistake.
Guys that get oiled and try and
pick up gals are easily spotted at the
crowded track. There are "Race
Horse Charlies" who wear coats and
shirts that look like they came
straight from the horses' backs. We
see exercise boys who look like over
sized monkeys, and then there are
always college kids who think they
know all about the races and go and
lose their dough (I know!).
