# Ruling Revised On Culturals
## 
### 
Upon the recommendation of
Women's Conference today ruled that
permission for 2 o'clock culturals
may be obtained only one day in ad
vance, provided that the permission
is granted by the time of Council
office hours, according to Courtaney
Perren, chairman of Women's Coun
cil.
Before this ruling was passed con
ference required that women obtain
permission for culturals two days
ahead of time. Miss Perren stressed,
however, the importance of filing
notice by the time of Council office
hours and that there can be no ex
ception made to this rule. Permis
sion for Saturday, Sunday, or Mon
day evenings must be obtained on
Friday.
The office hours of Women's
Council are Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday 5 to 6; Thursday 5:30-
6; and Friday 1 -2 p.m.
