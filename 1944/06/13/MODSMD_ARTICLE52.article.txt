# Farm Opens Course in Industrial Radiography; Army, industry Send Technicians for Study
## 
### 
A 60-hour course in Industrial
Radiography opened at Stanford yes
terday, attended by representatives
from major coast manufacturing
companies and men and women tech
nicians of the armed forces.
As part of the Engineering, Sci
ence, and Management War Training
sponsored and financed by the
United States Office of Education the
objectives of the course are to assist
war industries which have had to
develop X-ray methods, in many
cases with technical employees who
have not had specialized training,
Radiography Emphasized
Emphasis will be given to the
physical basis of radiography, and
the application of the physical prin
ciples to the working and interpreta
tion of radiographs. The purpose of
the course is to help the students to
judge the qualities of radiographs, to
interpret them in terms of density
and thickness, and in case he is not
himself taking the radiographs to
enable him to give instructions re
garding procedure to the persons
taking the radiograph. Special at
tention will be given to the radiog
raphy of light alloys.
There will be 20 hours of lectures
and 40 hours of laboratory work. The
laboratory work consists mainly of
the setting up of samples in the best
possible way of investigating their
defects. That means that the student
has to be familiar at the time with
the physical basis to a sufficient de
gree to understand why one sample
might be treated one way and an
other a different way.
