# Stanford Symphony Concert To Open With Gluck Overture
## 
### 
The overture "Iphigenia in Aulis"
by Gluck (Wagner version) will be
the opening number of the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra under the di
rection of Mr. Fercnc Molnar tomor
row in the Memorial Hall at 8 p.m.
In order to take advantage of the
extremely strong .string section, Vi
valdi's "Concerto Grosso in A Mi
nor" will be the second selection.
In the piece, four soloists will be
heardâ€”Miss Rulh Gumbrecht, Miss
Louise Phillips, Gordon Raisbeck and
Miss Ann Stuart.
Bruce Allen, bassoon soloist, will
be heard in Mozart's "Concerto in
B flat Major" for bassoon and or
chestra. This is one of the very few
masterpieces of the literature which
have been written for this instru
ment. Mr. Allen gained wide ac
claim in a concert last January
when he played "Peter and the Wolf"
Allen was the solo bassoonist of
the Tacoma Symphony Orchestra be
fore he came to Stanford. Undoubt
edly he would be the pride of any
symphony orchestra that he would
choose to join.
Mona Taylor will be heard with
her xylophone in the percussion sec
tion.
For the first time, the concert mas
ter's chair will be filled by a girl.
Miss Ruth Gumbrecht and Miss Eliz
abeth Moser Breed will share this
honor.
The concluding numbers will be
"Valse Triste," op. 44, by Sibelius,
and "Porgy and Bess Orchestral Se
lection," by Gershwin.
After the concert there will be a
party at Lagunita for members of
the symphony orchestra and their
friends. The hostesses will be Ruth
Gumbrecht and Ann Stuart.
