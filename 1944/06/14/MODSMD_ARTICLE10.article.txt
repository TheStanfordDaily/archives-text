# Nazis Counterattack, Fierce Street Battles Raging in Both Towns

### 
ALLIED SUPREME HEADQUARTERS, LONDON, Wednesday,
June 14 (UP). —Allied armies, keeping pace almost to the hour
with an invasion timetable laid out a year ago, made advances of
up to live miles in France Tuesday and planned a pincers round
Caen, but American troops gave ground to fierce counterattacks
at Montebourg and Carentan.
At a late hour Tuesday Allied headguarters circles were un
able to say which side held Montebourg, 14 miles southeast of
Cherbourg, and Carentan, near the base of the Cotentin penin
sula. Front reports said that street battles were in progress at
both towns.
In 112 the drive on Cherbourg, the Allied momentum shifted
toward the east flank of the 100-mile invasion front, for a joint
Anglo-American column was reported making a substantial gain
in the swinging drive to get behind Caen. (A Berlin radio broad
cast heard by NBC said that Montebourg had been recaptured by
the Germans.)
Plunging through a break between the Cerisy forest and
German-regained Tilly-sur-Seulles, armored forces drove to a
point south of Balleroy, 20 miles east of Caen, then swung east
ward in fluid fighting across a wide front. Exact gain was not
revealed but a dispatch said that British tanks were driving be
hind both Tilly and Caen.
The advance penetrated close to Caumont, six miles southeast
of Balleroy and Villers Bocage, seven miles south of Tilly, as the
Germans were caught off guard and Allied forces encountered,
beat a hasty retreat continuing on due south. American troops
which already had driven through the Cerisy forest reached
points 20 miles airline inside France—the deepest penetration yet
reported.
Simultaneously, British troops north of Caen launched an at
tack from their bridgehead on the east bank of the Oren Canal
and drove five miles, entering Troarn and applying the other arm
o fa pincers on Caen. Troarn is six miles east of Caen and 112
miles from Paris.
Already, only two roads to the southeast and south-southeast
from Caen are still open to the German defenders, who have
been using elements of three tank divisions and counter-attacks
to hold the city.
