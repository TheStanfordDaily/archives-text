### 
PEARL HARBOR, June 13 (UP). —A great U.S. carrier task
force forced the reluctant Japanese navy to battle, sank 13 vessels,
damaged 16 others, and destroyed 141 airplanes in a three-day
hunt across the Marianas Islands chain and nearby waters, Ad
miral Chester W. Nimitz announced today.
The flat-top and battle fleet scourged Saipan, Tinian, Guam,
and Rota Saturday and Sunday, then tracked down and smashed
a Japanese convoy and stray ships apparently trying to escape
into safer waters.
The three-day strike seriously crippled the Marianas, Japan's
outer defense range, Admiral Nimitz revealed. Most of the Japa
nese planes were downed in air combat during the Saturday
battle, when our carriers drove home the first of a series of week
end hammer blows.
U.S. losses totaled 15 aircraft and 15 men.
