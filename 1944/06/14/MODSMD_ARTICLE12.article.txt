LONDON, June 13 (UP).â€”Soviet tanks and infantry smashing
up the rugged Karelian Isthmus toward Viipuri gained three miles
today against a stubbornly resisting Finnish army fighting from
some of the most powerful fortifications in the world.
The broadcast Moscow war bulletins announced that General
Leonid Govorov's Leningrad army, battling through wild lake and
forest country, captured several defense points which the Finns
had constructed during the 31-month lull in the Russo-Finnish war
which was broken Saturday as the Russians assumed the offen
sive.
The Soviet bulletin reported no changes on the other sectors
of the eastern front and said that in Monday's fighting 12 enemy
planes were shot down.
