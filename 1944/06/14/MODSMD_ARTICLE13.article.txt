WASHINGTON, June 13 (UP). â€”President Roosevelt said today

in Europe, has reported to him that "other" openings will be made
in Hitler's European fortress and that "the Nazis will be forced
to fight throughout the perimeter."
The Eisenhower report also described the progress of the
fight in France as "satisfactory today," but said that in magnitude
the battle "is but a mere beginning to the tremendous struggles
