# Edwards Tells Of Free Press
## 
### 
"The war has shown us that none
but a free press can be a responsible
press," said Paul C. Edwards, asso
ciate editor of the San Francisco
News, as he spoke in the Tuesday
Evening Series lecture last, night.
"America and Britain have the duty
to insist on world-wide freedom of
the press after the war."
Speaking on pressures which re
strict freedom of the press, Mr. Ed
wards said that wartime brings ab
• normal restrictions—propaganda and
censorship—to bear on the press.
"There have admittedly been some
foolish and unnecessary restrictions
under the guise of military neces
sity," lie continued, "but all in all I
think the American people and
newspapers have not fared badly."
The press must be continually dis
satisfied and restive under censor
ship, he explained, because it is their
obligation to get all the news that
they can.
Pressure of Propaganda
The pressure of propaganda is con
stant in wartime, be said. The editor
is dependent on press associations
and news syndicates for his war
news, and he must strive to give his
readers the truth. During the last
war press associations unwittingly
published much news which later de
veloped to be propaganda. The pub
lishing of atrocity stories in this war
has been much more cautious as a
result.
"Our newspapers and press asso
ciations are rendering service of the
highest quality regardless of the ex
pense," he said, commenting on the
war news. "Never before has the
reading public been brought so close
to the fighting fronts. The mortality
of foreign correspondents has been
unprecedented."
Advertisers Not in Control
Speaking on pressures th;it always
prevail, Mr. Edwards discounted
popular beliefs as to the economic
pressure of advertisers. Except in
the exceptional cases, he said, it is
not true that advertisers control the
press. Advertisers must use the press
as one of their main media, and no
publisher need submit to their
wishes.
A subscription boycott by union
labor when it considers a paper in
imical to its interests will not per
manently injure a paper any more
than an advertising boycott, be con
tinued.
No Restrictions by Congress
Congress does not restrict news
paper freedom, he said, disagreeing
with David Lawrence, editor of the
United States News, who has com
plained of misuse of the commerce
clause. Mr. Edwards qualified Mr.
Lawrence's complaint by stating that
though legislation may make certain
practices hazardous lor the publish
ing business, it does not affect edi
torial freedom.
"The strongest, most continuous,
and most normal pressure on the
press is that of the readers them
selves," Mr. Edwards concluded. "No

wise editor ignores the public's ap
praisal of his product. He does not
slavishly follow the people he must
judge what he prints and stands for
but he cannot stand on a platform
above the people. He must be one
of them."

slavishly follow the people he must
judge what he prints and stands for
but he cannot stand on a platform
above the people. He must be one
of them."
"The war has shown us that none
but a free press can be a responsible
press," said Paul C. Edwards, asso
ciate editor of the San Francisco
News, as he spoke in the Tuesday
Evening Series lecture last, night.
"America and Britain have the duty
to insist on world-wide freedom of
the press after the war."
Speaking on pressures which re
strict freedom of the press, Mr. Ed
wards said that wartime brings ab
• normal restrictions—propaganda and
censorship—to bear on the press.
"There have admittedly been some
foolish and unnecessary restrictions
under the guise of military neces
sity," lie continued, "but all in all I
think the American people and
newspapers have not fared badly."
The press must be continually dis
satisfied and restive under censor
ship, he explained, because it is their
obligation to get all the news that
they can.
Pressure of Propaganda
The pressure of propaganda is con
stant in wartime, be said. The editor
is dependent on press associations
and news syndicates for his war
news, and he must strive to give his
readers the truth. During the last
war press associations unwittingly
published much news which later de
veloped to be propaganda. The pub
lishing of atrocity stories in this war
has been much more cautious as a
result.
"Our newspapers and press asso
ciations are rendering service of the
highest quality regardless of the ex
pense," he said, commenting on the
war news. "Never before has the
reading public been brought so close
to the fighting fronts. The mortality
of foreign correspondents has been
unprecedented."
Advertisers Not in Control
Speaking on pressures th;it always
prevail, Mr. Edwards discounted
popular beliefs as to the economic
pressure of advertisers. Except in
the exceptional cases, he said, it is
not true that advertisers control the
press. Advertisers must use the press
as one of their main media, and no
publisher need submit to their
wishes.
A subscription boycott by union
labor when it considers a paper in
imical to its interests will not per
manently injure a paper any more
than an advertising boycott, be con
tinued.
No Restrictions by Congress
Congress does not restrict news
paper freedom, he said, disagreeing
with David Lawrence, editor of the
United States News, who has com
plained of misuse of the commerce
clause. Mr. Edwards qualified Mr.
Lawrence's complaint by stating that
though legislation may make certain
practices hazardous lor the publish
ing business, it does not affect edi
torial freedom.
"The strongest, most continuous,
and most normal pressure on the
press is that of the readers them
selves," Mr. Edwards concluded. "No

wise editor ignores the public's ap
praisal of his product. He does not
slavishly follow the people he must
judge what he prints and stands for
but he cannot stand on a platform
above the people. He must be one
of them."
