# Dave and Tilly

### 
At the end of every volume of the Daily the outgoing editor
usually writes two editorials; one is to the new editor, the other
to the anaging editor, the loser in the election.
Those edits throughout the years have expressed the same sort
of sentiment, but there always have been things in them that
meant something only to staff members or to the particular per
sons involved. They recalled incidents, etc., that were peculiar
to the Daily and to the persons who work on the staff.
And so at the end of this volume there will be no editorials
to Dave and Tilly. There's a lot to be said to them. And it will
be said, too, but only to them.
