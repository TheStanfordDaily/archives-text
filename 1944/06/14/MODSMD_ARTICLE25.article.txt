CONFESSIONS OF A GEISHA GIRL
Have you ordered your summer Chappie yet? You haven't?
Why, you driveling idiot!
The summer Chappie, which strangely enough will make its
appearance on Quad summer quarter, is going on subscription
for those who will not be on campus this summer at the new all
time low, never heard of before, price of 25 cents. The mag will
contain 28 pages of new, revolutionary humor, under the editor
ship of the new Old Boy, Dick Driscoll. Get yours early!
Remember: Your vacation won't be happy
If you fail to get that Chappie.
A FEW INTERESTING FACTS
Your goldfish will live a more happy and contented life if kept
in water. Portuguese is the most widely used language in Portu
gal. Dypsomaniac is the most interesting word in the dictionary.

tallest building on the Stanford campus. There will be only two
more Bullsessions this quarter.
