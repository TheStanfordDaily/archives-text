General Dwight D. Eisenhower in a message to his invasion
troops last night said, "The accomplishments in the first seven
days of the campaign have exceeded my highest hopes."
Here is a portion of the text of the supreme commander's mes
sage to the commanders and troops:
"One week ago this morning there was established through
your co-ordinated efforts our first foothold in northwestern Eu
rope.
"High as was my pre-invasion confidence in your courage,
skill and effectiveness in working together as a unit, your accom
plishments in the first seven days of the campaign have exceeded
my highest hopes.
"You are truly a great Allied team, a team in which each part
gains its greatest satisfaction in rendering maximum assistance
to the entire body, and in which each individual member is justi
fiably confident in all the others. No matter how prolonged or
bitter lies the struggle ahead, you will do your full part toward
the restoration of Free France, the liberation of all European na
tions under Axis domination and the destruction of the Nazi mili
tary machine.
"112 truly congratulate you upon a brilliantly successful begin
ning to this great undertaking. Liberty-loving people everywhere
y/ould like to join me in saying to you: 'I am proud of you.' "
j 'dging from the general tone of the message, Eisenhower
' / intended to establish this beachhead and maintain it. First
'I foremost he wants to see just exactly how this will turn out.
Af'"r /ill the Uniu d Nations are banking on this lone man and

the organization he has established for breaking down a battle
wise and powerful Nazi war machine.
ADD BREAKDOWN OF NAZI WAR MACHINE
It will be only a matter of time until the German war machine
will break down substantially. This will be due to reduced ship
ment of ball-bearings to Germany from Sweden, which for the
present has kindly condescended to take such drastic action.
Eisenhower is after a complete physical and mechanical break
down of the Wehrmacht, and lack of shipment of ball-bearings
from Sweden will cause only a mechanical breakdown. Germany
still has many stockpiles of ball-bearings, but if she intends to
oppose a victory-bent Allied invasion army, she'll have to build
more war weapons which will reguire ball-bearings. Most of her
own factories that are producing ball-bearings have had their
production schedules reduced forcibly by the Britain based Eighth
Air Force.
INVADERS' PROGRESS
On the invasion coast, powerful American invasion forces
have advanced to within 10 miles of the great French port of
Cherbourg yesterday after capturing Montebourg, 14 miles to
the southeast, and the British on the extreme left of the Normandy
front swept seven miles ahead to Troarn, 111 miles from Paris.
General Eisenhower's headguarters termed the surging ad
vances through the faltering German defenses "very, very satis
factory." A "big advance" is reported officially south of Bayeux.
The Yanks laying siege to Cherbourg captured Le Ham, three
miles southwest of Montebourg, and Ponte Abbe and moved
within five miles of the west coast railway leading from the third
French port. The forces are plunging halfway across the jagged
peninsula.
