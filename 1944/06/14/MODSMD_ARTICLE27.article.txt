OUR CHINESE PROBLEM
There is today rising in the East a nation representing one
fifth of the world's population, a nation which has earned and
been granted the world's respect for a tremendous struggle
against the barbarous dwarfs of Japan. China has received our
admiration, our sympathy, our financial assistance to wage war
and to abet relief, and now the beginnings of an active military
alliance. We are beginning to realize China will be of prime im
portance in the post-war world, a vital and growing market for
countries, such as ours, which require huge exports and imports
to maintain their economy.
In addition, China will be a bulwark against a possibly resur
gent Japan, a balancing factor in the Far East. Paeans of praise
have been showered on a deserving China, its people and its
leaders. America is awakening to the realization that a vast force
is developing in the East, a power that considers America its
best friend, America, the friend of China and the Chinese. But
are we the friend of the Chinese- Of China as a nation, yes; but
of the individual Chinese, no.
Do we understand the Chinese, are we even making the at
tempt to understand the people of China, as people, not as the
intangible representation of an idea and a force resisting our
common enemy, "the little dwarfs"?
Several days ago some friends and I were talking to a Chinese
friend, long a resident in this country. Mr. "X" was asked if he
intended to apply for citizenship under the new naturalization
law. "I would like to very, very much, but as an American citizen
I must of course give up my Chinese citizenship. Then I am a
man without a country. Americans will not accept me as one
of them, although America will.
"In America we Chinese are given only nominal recognition
ias Americans. Always present is the bite of discrimination. I
very much want to become an American citizen but The
I "but" was as eloquent as innumerable citations of indignities
heaped upon the finest products of a modernizing Chinese civili
zation.
He wasn't critical, nor bitter, just deeply hurt. He has lived
here many years. In the United States he finds the sort of country
he most wants to live in, except that we will not recognize him
as completely a human being entitled to the same rights as our
selves.
Several months ago a young Chinese girl from a very fine
family, newly arrived in this country, tried to rent a room in town.
The landlady said, "We don't rent to Chinese." She told us this
story, very bewildered, deeply hurt, not understanding how such
a thing could happen in the world's greatest democracy.
I do not believe in the efficacy of ranting and raving as a
means of "convincing people that perhaps they have been wrong.
Let us settle such problems with our brains and hearts, not with
blind prejudice. In trying to effect an understanding with the
latter type too often they will say, "How can we compromise
when you refuse to accept our views." Such reasoning is alien
to our political doctrines. The opportunities are open to all of us
to educate ourselves as to the Chinese. This education, plus a
concrete attempt on our part to eliminate unwarranted prejudices,
will be the beginning of understanding.
Let us all realize that we must work for the better world we all
hope to attain through the tremendous blood-letting the world is
now undergoing. With the pessimists I hold no truck. It is oh, so
easy to sit back comfortably and sneer and ridicule the attempts
to attain "a brave new world." These pessimists reap the bene
fits, do nothing constructive to attain the objectives. They will
not realize Utopia will not be attained after his war, nor after any
other war. Our American way is to gradually improve our system
to the greater benefit of the greatest number of our people. We
must work for that goal.
There are also among us the naive optimists who seek to attain
Utopia at one stroke. Such people do as much, probably more,
harm than the confirmed pessimists. No peoples, no governments
are ever all black or all white. Innumerable shades of gray depict
what we are and v/hat our governments are. Pessimism is not
warranted but surely neither is over-optimism. With these con
siderations as background let us work and make that effort to
try to understand all those peoples, our friends, who have been
victimized by our blind, unreasoning, and if we are honest, often
ignorant prejudices. We are fighting for a free world, one rid of
intolerance.
If Chinese want to live among us we should deem it an honor
that of all the countries in the world they consider this the one
which will best provide them with a society practicing, as well
as preaching, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. Let us practice
what many of us are dying for, and will die for. Mutual under
standing, between people as well as nations, is the cornerstone
for the brave new world. Let us lay that cornerstone and watch
how rapidly the edifice grows.
