### ROGER CORMAN 
Witli civilian, medic, and army teams competing, an all -University swimming meet will be held this Saturday
afternoon in the men's pool. Slated for 1 o'clock, the tourney will be composed of seven events, and will de
termine the swimming champs of the Farm.
One team each will represent the civilians and the med school, while Co. A and Co. C have signed up for the
Army.
Because of the interest shown for the water tourney a low weeks ago, Coach Charles Sprague has arranged

this meet to give the losing teams *
another crack at the title. There- j
suits of the former tournament have
been dropped, and the crown will go |
to the winner of this Saturday's
fracas.
Five individual races, one relay,
and a diving competition are sched
uled. The dashes feature 50, 100, and
150-yard free-style, 75-yard breast
stroke, and 75-yard back-stroke
events, while the relay will bring to
gether four eight-man teams. Open
to all comers, the diving will be oil' j
the low board and be composed of I
lour required and two optional j
plunges.
ftnler by Friday
Men wishing to compete for the I
civilian team should see Bruce Jes- j
sup sometime before Friday night so !
the lineup can be arranged.
Med School students should see i
Pete Lee to enter, while soldiers can !
sign up through their companies.
If they can bring together enough
manpower to enter the relay, the
Medics rate the position as favorites
off their good showing in the few
events they entered in the last meet.
The civilians are in somewhat the
same boat the meds arc, while the
Army can be counted on to furnish
two complete teams.
