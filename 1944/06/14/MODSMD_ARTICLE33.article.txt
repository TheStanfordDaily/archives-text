# Track, Boxing, Wrestling To Feature Last Sports Event of Spring Quarter
## 
### 
Rounding out the sports program for the end of the quarter, an all-
UniversiU' Field Day has been scheduled for Wednesday, June 21. Com
bining track, boxing, wrestling, and any other events that can be thrown
in before starting time, this Irish stew of sports will get underway at
6:30 p..m
There will be two boxing matches, one to determine the civilian champ,

and one to find the army title
holder. The two wrestling matches
will be .run of! in the same manner,
while a bicycle race may be held if
there is enough interest.
Prospective entrants should sign up
this week or early next week in the
men's gym.
It hasn't yet been decided whether
to run the meet off as a competition
between teams as the last one war, or
to make it an individual affair to de
termine the champ in each event.
Because of their decisive victory
over the forces of the Army and Med
School in the former tourney, the
Civilians will rule as solid favorites
to repeat their win and hold the
Stanford track crown if the meet
is handled as a battle between teams.
