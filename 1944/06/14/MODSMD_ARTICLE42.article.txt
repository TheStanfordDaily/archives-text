# Quad Out by Finals, Features Photos
## 
### 
You will definitely get your '44
Quad before finals, at least by Friday
the 23rd, promised Virginia Hobbs.
They will be on sale while they
last in front of the P.O. today from
9 to 12 and 1 to 2:30, and every day
at the Quad office. You may buy
them for $5.75 still, although it is
too late to get your name on.
Featuring new photographic slants
of the Quad, the Lake, the Row, and
many other campus spots, the Quad
also boosts "a great number of cam
pus beauties."
