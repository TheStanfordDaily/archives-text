# Who Can Solve the Mystery Of the Four Silent Statues?
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
It was a routine assignment. "Find out the story behind those statues in
front of Jordan Hall and the Ad building."
The beginning of the assignment was simple enough. The names of the
statues are plainly engraved on the pedestals: Guttenburg, Benjamin Frank
lin, von Humboldt, and Agassiz.
But why those four men were chosen, what they were to symbolize, and

• when they were erected remains a
mystery.
Records of Agassi/, alone could be
found. Ho flashed briefly into the
limelight during the Great Earth
quake when his statue catapulted
hear first into the cement. He sank
fully a foot into the ground; leaving
his feet waving incongruously in the
air. Then was the time of the famous
wisecrack (attributed by some to
David Starr Jordan), "Agassiz is fine
in the abstract, but not in the con
crete."
We are happy to say that Agassiz
suffered only a slightly damaged
nose, and was soon returned to his
place of honor above the archways
of Jordan Hall.
But hours of delving in musty
volumes of forgotten lore have failed
to uncover any more <rf the tale be
hind those four silent statues. Not
even the student guides know why
they are there.
If anyone knows will he please
phone the Daily? The entire staff is
consumed with curiosity.
