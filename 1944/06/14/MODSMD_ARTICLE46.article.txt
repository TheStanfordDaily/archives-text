### 
"Now that the invasion of Europe
has started, I predict that victory in
the European theater will be our in
November of 1944, and the Pacific
war will come to an end in 1946."
These are the predictions of Maj.
Gen. Paul B. Malone, KGO's mili
tary news analyst, who has made
such accurate forecasts on his pro
grams as on June 15 when he said,
"Italy will sue for peace within three
months." Just one week less than
three months later Italy's uncondi
tional surrender was announced.
