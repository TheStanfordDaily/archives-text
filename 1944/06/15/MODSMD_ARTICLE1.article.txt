ALLIED SUPREME H.Q., LON
DON. Thursday, June 15 (UP) â€”
American troops, smashing two of
five major German counterattacks
launched against the French beach
head, resumed their offensives
Wednesday morning westward across
the Cherbourg peninsula and south
ward from Carentan.
Fierce, fluctuating battles raged
through the day in the Caen-Tilly
sector to the east where the enemy,
mounted three other massive counter
blows using between 500 and GOO
tanks from four armored divisions.
They were met by the full force of
the allied air arms and long-range
broadsides from allied warships as
well as hard-fighting ground forces,
and the resulting struggle was de
scribed as the most intense since
Stalingrad.
Late Wednesday, Allied Head
quarters relinquished claim to three
towns which had been reported cap

tured: Mountebourg, 14 miles south
of Cherbourg; Troarn on the opposite
flank six miles east of Caen, and
Caumont, 1J miles south oi Bayeux.
Fluid fighting was continuing for all
i three and front dispatches said the
American Fourth Division had
; fought back into the streets of Moun
tebourg for the third time in 16
| hours.
[ Henry T. Gorrell of United Press
reported in a dispatch filed at 6:30
| p.m. Wednesday that the German at
: tack around Mountebourg was being
j held, that U.S. units still held points
to the northeast and that the Fourth
Division resumed the offensive west-
I ward.
Its objective was the road and rail
junction of St. Sauveur-Le-Victome,
two-thirds of the way across the
] peninsula and only eight miles from
| the west coast. The attack was
launched Wednesday morning and
j "good progress" is reported, Gorrell
[ said.
