# FINNISH FRONT EXPANDED
## 
### 
LONDON, Thursday, June 15 (UP)
! More Russian Army columns backed
by artillery, firing wheel to wheel,
! fanned out over the wild Karelian
i Isthmus on the broadening 25-mile
i front yesterday and one unit pushed
| to within 37 miles to the southeast of
i and forest country below Viipuri,
by capturing the town of Kuterselka,
!on the east side of the Leningrad-
Helsinki railroad.
Front dispatches said fierce hand
to-hand struggles were being fought
as the Russians pushed steadily to
ward the outer defenses of the Man
nerheim line strung across the lake
and forest country below Biipuri,
capture of which brought Finnish
capitulation in the 1939-40 winter
war.
