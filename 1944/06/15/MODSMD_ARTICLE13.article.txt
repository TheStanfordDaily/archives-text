### Hayes Hunter 
The big question for the present is, "Why doesn't somebody
do something with De Gaulle?" Maybe it was a big mistake for
us to collaborate with him. For the past few days he has been
getting in everybody's hair in general, from Eisenhower to the
State Department.
Reporting from Washington yesterday, John Hightower of the '
A.P. said that in the final hours before the start of the invasion i
of France, General Charles De Gaulle reportedly cancelled the ;
orders of several hundred French officers scheduled to land with
the first waves of the allied troops.
COOPERATION IMPAIRED
Reports from General Eisenhower's headquarters to the highest
military officials in Washington disclosed yesterday that as a
result, cooperation between the French population and allied
armies has been impaired in the occupied Normandy areas.
This is true, according to officials who are investigating the!
situation now, even though De Gaulle finally relented to the I
extent of allowing 20 French officers to go along with the forces •
assigned to liberate their homeland.
LIKE A SPOILED CHILD '
De Gaulle's action with respect to the officers is said to be
the newest factor entering into the background of a proposed
meeting between President Roosevelt and the leader of the
French National Committee in Washington later this month or
early in July.
The situation has been developing since the assassination of
Admiral Darlan, and developed consistently while De Gaulle
acted like a spoiled child by having General Giraud and several
other men removed from responsible positions on the liberation
committee. *
LIAISON OFFICERS
Then many months back when the big allied push was being
planned, officials of the French National Committee suggested
that military officers representing the committee should serve
as liaison officers between the invading forces and the French
population.
Allied authorities agreed and the combined chiefs of staff,
acting in the name of the British and American governments, di-i
rected General Eisenhower to make use of the French officers.
Subsequently the committee assigned several hundred French
officers to Eisenhower's command and they were given special
training with the invasion forces.
REVERSE POSITION
When General De Gaulle arrived in London two days before ,
D-Day (D minus two) he brought up for review this whole ques
tion of the use of French officers and the extent of cooperation
between the committee and General Eisenhower's forces. As a
result—and Washington officials say he was trying to force
recognition of the committee as a government -De Gaulle sud
denly reversed the long established French position and refused
to let the officers go on the assigned mission.
The insistence of allied commands on having some repre
sentation for dealing with the F'rench people finally forced De
Gaulle to relent to the extent of allowing 20 officers to make ,
the trip. Washington officials further add that Eisenhower's
reports show that the officers who were forbidden to go were
extremely disappointed.
POUTING-BOY ATTITUDE
These pouting-boy I-won't-do-it-because-I-am-mad-at-you ac
tions of De Gaulle were understood to have strengthened the
White House and State Department decision against recognizing
the liberation committee as France's provisional government.
Big mess, isn't it? All because De Gaulle has assumed this
'Holier than thou" attitude and will not cooperate with the Allies
to the extent a man whose country is being liberated should. He
has caused enough of a mess so far, why doesn't he wise up and
settle down? There are probably quite a few facts behind this
vhole thing we don't know about, but in viaw of the present
conditions, maybe it's bolter we don t.
