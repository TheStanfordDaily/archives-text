# Med School, Army Playoff Set for Friday, June 23
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
The breathlessly awaited playoff
between the Navy Med School,
champions of the civilian Softball
league, and the champions of the
army intramural league for the soft
ball crown of the University finally
comes oft' a week from this Friday,
on June 23. The game will be played
on the Sunken Diamond at 7:15 p.m.
The Med School, which went
through the intramural season unde
feated, boasts of a team of good hit
ters and smooth fielders. Pitcher
Wayne Price has plenty on the ball,
as many an erstwhile slugger of the
intramural league can- attest. The
navy boys led the circuit all the way,
of such comers as Fire
house, Hayes, and Gerona. ,
The army team remains a dark
horse, the team not even chosen yet.
Instead of the scheduled contest with
the champions of the army league,
the Meds are to be faced by an all
star team composed of the best play
ers from each of the six or seven
teams in the army league. The tenta
tive candidates for the team have
gotten in a considerable amount of
practice in the last two weeks, and
may prove to be more than a match
for the navy men.

Since the army team is completely 1
unknown, it is rather difficult to :
predict the outcome of this one. No
one seems to have bothered to scout
the army league, and the character of
the play there is consequently little
known. However, on the strength of
their past record, we'll give the Med
boys the game by 3 or 4 runs.
