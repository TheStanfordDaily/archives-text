# Bailey Writes Book on Peace
## 
### 
Professor Thomas A. Bailey of the
history department recently returned
from the East where he spent the
past year teaching at Harvard and
doing research for his new book,
'Woodrow Wilson and the Lost
Peace." The book will be published
.Kily 17 by the MacMillan Company.
'"Woodrow Wilson and the Lost
Peace" tells the story of Wilson's part
in making the Treaty of Versailles,
stated Dr. Bailey. It is a critical
study which emphasizes the errors
made last time in making peace with
the thought that we may be able to
avoid these now. Dr. Bailey had ac
cess to Woodrow Wilson's papers in
the Library of Congress for his re
search.
Dr. Bailey is now working on a
sequel volume which will be on
Woodrow Wilson and the betrayal
of Europe. This book is about the
failure of the Senate to approve the
Treaty of Versailles and the result
ing consequences.
With the two volumes, Dr. Bailey
hopes to begin educating American
public opinion in the responsibilities
of making peace and then of accept
ing that peace.
