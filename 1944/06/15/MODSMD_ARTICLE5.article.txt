Candidates for the AST Reserve
Program who postpone their actual
enlistment in the Enlisted Reserve
Corps until shortly before the dead
line of July 1 may find that this delay
on their part will make it impossible
for the Army to assign them to a
college for classes starting in July,
stated Col. John R. Eden, Comman
dant at Stanford University.
"It is emphasized," said Colonel
Eden, "that those young men who
intend to participate in the Army's
new college program at an early date
should do so without further delay
whenever possible. The time neces
sary for processing of enlistment
papers, issuance of orders to actual
duty, and the actual travel time re
quired for trainees to report at col
leges, make it extremely doubtful
that any reservist enlisting after June
25 may be assigned to a July class.
Young men eligible 'for enlistment
at this time for participation in the
college training program are those
who have graduated from high
school, are less than 18 years old,

Army and Navy last March 15.
Those who enlist in the reserve
may attend college on an inactive
