beachheads on Saipan and arc ad
vancing inland in the face of heavy
Japanese gunfire and tank attacks,
the Navy announced tonight.
Fighting was described as "heavy,"
but the Navy added that "good prog
ress is being made against well
organized defenses."
The Japanese were making des
perate attempts to stem the advance
inland by throwing up an artillery
barrage and mortar and machine-gun
fire.
The Japanese counter-attacked
with tanks but were smashed back
with the aid of naval gunfire and
carrier-based aircraft.

moved U.S. lines within 1,449 miles
of the Japanese homeland at the
same time that U.S. B-29 "super
fortresses" struck in strength against
Japanese industrial centers on Ky

u.shu island as llio Allied Pacific of
fensive closed in on the heart of the
Nipponese empire.
Amphibious assault troops landed
on Saipan under cover of a tre
mendous naval bombardment, the
climax of a punishing four-day at
tack by carrier-based aircraft and
warships against the Marianas.
Tlie invasion on Saipan, (he great
est island hop since America began
the long drive back in the dark days
of Guadalcanal opened only 48 hours
before the giant 13-29 bombers of the
20th Army Air Force struck the
northern Kyushu island industrial
area of Japan's mainland Friday
morning (Japan time).
The official Japanese radio an
nounced Thursday night that Ya
wata, home of the great Imperial
steel works, and the nearby indus
trial city of Moji and Kokura had
