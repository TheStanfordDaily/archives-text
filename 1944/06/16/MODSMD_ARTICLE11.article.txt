# Allotments, Jam Session Net $5,565
## 
### 
With over $500 cash sales at the
Wednesday night jam session, almost
that much at last Friday's dance, and
over $4,000 already tallied in allot
ments, SCU 3905's segment of the
Fifth War Loan Drive is well under
way. An enthusiastic crowd of G.l.'s
and coeds at the jam session crowded
War Board Representatives Virginia
Walker and Jean Bui lis for bonds
and stamps, both during and after the
solid sending of the battalion swing
band.
Next on the program is tonight's
dance, at which the guys and gals
will again have an opportunity to
enlist their money in the Invasion
Bond Drive, thereby laying away a
truly patriotic nest-egg.
Liberal Passes
Adding excitement to the jam ses
sion was the announcement from
Captains Brown and Frank of A
and C companies, respectively, that
all soldiers who purchase at least one
cash bond will be granted an espe
cially liberal weekend pass.
This followed on the heels of the
message from Colonel Eden that the
platoon whose members pile up the
biggest total in bonds and stamps
will be feted at an end-term party,
and the runner-up platoon at an
other.
New Bond Appears
An outstanding feature of the drive
to date has been the appearance of
the new G.I. Bond—a $10 bond, sell
ing for $7.50. Allotments to buy at
least one of these compact kegs of
ammunition a month are pouring in
from soldier-students at Stanford,
and Bond Drive heads expect to cross
the tape on July 31 with 100 per cent
score in these allotments as 3905's gift
to General "Ike" and his men.
Last, but certainly not least—vol
unteer soldier-artists, such as Arthur
Aronson, Clyde Shuford, and Les
Roscnzweig, have given freely of
their time and talent in turning out
posters and signs for the drive. The
result? Posters so powerful and well
done thai some of them will be made
available for general use at higher
headquarters. These posters repre
sent the feelings of the average G.I.
here about the Invasion Bond Drive
—he's in it with all lie's got, and pull
ing his friends in with him!

over $4,000 already tallied in allot
ments, SCU 3905's segment of the
Fifth War Loan Drive is well under
way. An enthusiastic crowd of G.l.'s
and coeds at the jam session crowded
War Board Representatives Virginia
Walker and Jean Bui lis for bonds
and stamps, both during and after the
solid sending of the battalion swing
band.
Next on the program is tonight's
dance, at which the guys and gals
will again have an opportunity to
enlist their money in the Invasion
Bond Drive, thereby laying away a
truly patriotic nest-egg.
Liberal Passes
Adding excitement to the jam ses
sion was the announcement from
Captains Brown and Frank of A
and C companies, respectively, that
all soldiers who purchase at least one
cash bond will be granted an espe
cially liberal weekend pass.
This followed on the heels of the
message from Colonel Eden that the
platoon whose members pile up the
biggest total in bonds and stamps
will be feted at an end-term party,
and the runner-up platoon at an
other.
New Bond Appears
An outstanding feature of the drive
to date has been the appearance of
the new G.I. Bond—a $10 bond, sell
ing for $7.50. Allotments to buy at
least one of these compact kegs of
ammunition a month are pouring in
from soldier-students at Stanford,
and Bond Drive heads expect to cross
the tape on July 31 with 100 per cent
score in these allotments as 3905's gift
to General "Ike" and his men.
Last, but certainly not least—vol
unteer soldier-artists, such as Arthur
Aronson, Clyde Shuford, and Les
Roscnzweig, have given freely of
their time and talent in turning out
posters and signs for the drive. The
result? Posters so powerful and well
done thai some of them will be made
available for general use at higher
headquarters. These posters repre
sent the feelings of the average G.I.
here about the Invasion Bond Drive
—he's in it with all lie's got, and pull
ing his friends in with him!
