# Yanks 3 Miles From Cherbourg
## 
### 
American troops hammered Thurs
day to within three miles of Cher
bourg, west coast rail lifeline and
blockaded it with shells while U.S.
forces to the northeast, surging past
still hotly contested Montebourg,
captured Quinellc on the cast coast
of the Cotentin peninsula.
Battling westward across the pe
ninsula, on a 10-mile front, the
Yanks met stiff resistance from crack
grenadiers of the 17th SS Panzier di
vision—the fifth German tank di
vision thrown into the Normandy
fighting—and breasted a barrage of
new type shells which showered our

positions with flaming oil.
The greatest battle of the cam
paign raged on through its second
day in a blazing third-degree square
mile triangle bounded by Tilly, Bal
leroy and Villers-Docage to the east
where fierce German counterattacks
falied to relax the Allied plncer grip
on Caen.
The capture of Quincville, 16 miles
southeast of Cherbourg, and sur
rounding area gave the Americans a
valuable new landing point for sup
plies and reinforcements but it still
was in range of enemy guns, pre
cluding its full-scale use for the
moment.
