# Salvage Drive Scheduled for Quarter's End
## 
### 
The last salvage collection of this
quarter will be held Wednesday,
June 28. Scrap is being collected the
last day of finals so that anything
discarded at the end of the quarter
may be salvaged for the war effort,
according to Barbara Pike, salvage
chairman.
Items needed of this salvage col
lection are: clothes, rags, electrical
appliances, furnishings, bric-a-brac,
rubber, metals of all kinds, and paper
in any form except small scraps.
Binder paper is fine, so any un
wanted notes should be saved. All
these items will go to the Salvation
Army.
Victory books will be collected the
same day, and will eh given to the
Servicemen's Library' in Palo Alto.
Any un-needed books or magazines
will be appreciated.
The Palo Atlo Bed Cross has asked
for modern dance records. Anyone
wanting to donate their old records
may put them with the salvage in
their residence, and they will be col-
Ictced and given to the Bed Cross and
later distributed among the service
men stationed in this area.
Any students who find any of these
items when they arc packing to go
home are reminded that salvage is
needed to help win the war. Articles
which cannot be taken home should
be placed in the salvage box to be
collected in the last drive of the
quarter, June 28.
