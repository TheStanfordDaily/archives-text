# It's Almost Time

### 
Every editor of the Daily is supposed to v/rite a farewell
editorial, a sort of sentimental windup. And now it's my turn.
Right now the radio on my desk is giving out with "Summer
time," which really struck me as a funny coincidence because I
was thinking of summertime, too.
I was thinking about the way the ratio would be set in its
traditional form —more men than women. I was thinking about
the war and wondering how it will be going by then and just
how it will tie in with Stanford. And of course I was thinking
about the Daily, and about its coming out only twice a week in
tabby form. And I was feeling sorry for Dave, because of the
many times he'll be told that the paper isn't much more than a
bulletin board.
"Summertime" just ended, and so I'd better say a couple of
things about winter and spring and Volume 105. This volume
started with a green staff and without much money; it's ending
with a good staff, composed mainly of freshmen who have been
asked to do twice their share, and with a good business staff. I
can't say that I have been proud of every edition, but I can say
that I am proud to have been editor of The Stanford Daily and
proud to have worked with the persons who compose the staff.
I haven't run out of thoughts, but the words won't come, and
if they did, there wouldn't be space for them. And so, as much
as I'd like to say "See ya on Quad," I guess it's about time to
start the long trip home. Goodbye and thanks.
