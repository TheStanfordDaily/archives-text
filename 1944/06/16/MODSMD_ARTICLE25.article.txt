GET THAT SUMMER CHAPPIE!
If you have little time to look through the stuff that the Daily
Biz Staff calls ads, you will discover a real funny one-column ad
put in by the Chaparral, the "World's number one college humor
magazine." In this ad, along with a famous Chappie drawing, the
"four old men," is a coupon.
Look at this coupon carefully and try to figure out what it
means. After a few minutes of thought you will discover that
it is a subscription for the Summer Chaparral. Now comes the
hard part.
Ask the guy standing next to you for a pencil. Take that pen
cil and write in your name on the line which says, "Name." At
this point it might be wise to take a few minutes rest before going
on.
Next, you get the phone book of your home town and look
up your address. When you have done this, write down your
address on the line which says "Address." Look at the cover
of the phone book and see what town it is, and then write that
in the appropriate place. Now for the research. Get hold of a
map of the United States and try to locate which state your home
town is in. This shouldn't take long. Write that in the appro-!
priate place.
Under the heading, "Other Stuff" write in your phone num
ber (see phone book again) if you are a beautiful unattached
blond.
Borrow a quarter (steal it if necessary) and put it in an
envelope along with the Daily in which the coupon is filled out.'
Those who have scissors may cut the coupon out and put it in
the envelope instead of the entire Daily. But don't forget tho
quarter! The 25 cents is to cover mailing and handling and you
qet the Chappie free for nothing.
If you can't write, just walk over to the Chappie office and
qivr- us your name, address, and quarter in person.
