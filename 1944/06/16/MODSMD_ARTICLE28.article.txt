Displaying fraternity and sorority
jewelry from their large stock, the
L. F. Balfour Company look over one
side of the Nitery yesterday with an
exhibit presented by their district
manager, Frank Griflin.
The display included fraternity and
sorority pins, identification pins,
rings, novelty jewelry with organiza
tion crests, identification bracelets,
key chian charms, compacts, and
leather goods such as cigarette cases,
billfolds, and letter cases.
Mr. Grifin commented on the origin
of the narrow key ends found on Phi
Beta Kappa keys and other pins:
"It's of historical interest to know
that in the days of pocket watches,
gentlemen used their key ends to
wind their watches. Their use has
ended, but the tradition still lives."
Balfour's main offices and factory
are located at Attleboro, Mass., in
the region where 89 per cent of
America's silverware and silver
products are manufactured. Their
San Francisco office is in Suite (>O5-
(>O6 a t2s.'} Post street, part of an or
ganization which has over 800 em
ployees.
