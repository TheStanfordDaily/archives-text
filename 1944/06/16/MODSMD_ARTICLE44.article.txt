# Four Jills' Time Worn, Tired Tale
## 
### 
NOW PLAYING AT THE STAN
FORD THEATER: Four Jills and
a Jeep, starring Dick Haymes, Carole
Landis, Kay Francis, Martha Raye,
and so on far into the night.
The already time-worn tale of the
Four Jills and their Jeep (consult
your Saturday Evening Posts) comes
to life on the screen, but dies a hor
rible death as such stories usually
do. The entertainment the girls car
ried to England and Africa is still
solid and effective as such, but the
story is lost in the blare of too much
music. Music fans will be delighted
provided they haven't heard Haymes'
recordings of his numbers too often.
If thes cript writers had stuck to
If the script writers had stuck to
stereotyped sentimentality, their
product might have had more force.
However, Dick Haymes, our candi
date for sing-king, lightens the musi
cal load with such numbers as "How
Many Times" and "How Blue the
Night." We'll bet the boys overseas
really went for Mitzi Mayfair, whose
vivacity and dancing ability were
peppy enough to pick up the story's
downward roll.
The photography was not excep
tional, the sequence was spotty, but
the music—including the guest num
bers by Alice Faye and Carmen Mi
randa—was well presented. Martha
Raye, and Man-with-the-teeth Phil
Silvers clowned satisfactorily during
their routines.
Tampico had in it the elements of
either an odd romance, or a tale of
international intrigue, but the com
bination was impossible. Edward G.
Robinson and Lynn Bari are their
mediocre best in mediocre roles. Vic
tor McLaglen appears briefly, but
we were "glad ta see him."
