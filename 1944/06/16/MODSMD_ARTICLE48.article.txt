# G.I. JIVE

### ROGER WILCO 
Quarter windup for the Jiver, so
let's make mention of credits. Credit
Dr. Popper with much of the suc
cess enjoyed by the bund; his per
sonality and line musicianship have
lifted them above themselves. Thank
unsung Jim Walters, without whose
help the ASC dances and swing ses
sions could never have been held.
Thank Stanley Sharp for Ihe co
operation in obtaining facilities for
student functions. There are many
others, too, whom you don't hear
about, without whom life at Stan
ford would be dreary.

bowl to the chest and stomach. B.J.
feints with a left and comes up with
a right lipstick jab to the face. Sam
uel connects with lefts and rights to
the chin for a KO in 1:03 of the first
round. The winnah and new pow

Ilell/apoppin Highlights
General comment on Fleet City
Ork was music to the ears of ASC.
Floor was perfect and the crowd
just right. Congrats to Bobby White
side on being chosen Queen. 01
course, for me theie's none to com
pare with Queen Ellery; every man
to his own. . . . Confetti about mid
night was Ihe nearest thing to snow
we've seen in many a sun. Good
time for all; even Col. Eden caught
the spirit and showered confetti
about him!
The Brighter Side
Those wonderful Roble girls who
helped decorate the Gym for Ilell
zapoppin, and then climbed out of
bed at (5:30 Sunday a.m. to help
clean up. For the Army, Roble,
name it and it's yours. And so to
finals and furlough while Winnie
winds it up for the WAC.
IT THE MILL —Will we ever forget?
. . . the orders last January send
ing us to Stanford—on two hours'
notice, of course . , . getting off at
Paly at G a.m. one rainy Sunday . . .
the G1 who took us to our new home
and told us we were to live in tents
until our barracks were completed
. . . those first quarter schedules with
22 units and a thousand labs . . .
being introduced to that place called
anatomy and asking meekly: "Do
we have to stay here all afternoon?"
And we did! . . . that first pass to
San Francisco . . . those first final
exams . . . spring furlough . . . those
exercise groups in the dayroom, for
therapeutic purposes
And now that our six months here
is almost over, we're looking for
ward to: the orders telling us where
to next ... a long train ride—home,
we hope ... a few days minus rev
eille. Such sweet thoughts.

Ilell/apoppin Highlights
General comment on Fleet City
Ork was music to the ears of ASC.
Floor was perfect and the crowd
just right. Congrats to Bobby White
side on being chosen Queen. 01
course, for me theie's none to com
pare with Queen Ellery; every man
to his own. . . . Confetti about mid
night was Ihe nearest thing to snow
we've seen in many a sun. Good
time for all; even Col. Eden caught
the spirit and showered confetti
about him!
The Brighter Side
Those wonderful Roble girls who
helped decorate the Gym for Ilell
zapoppin, and then climbed out of
bed at (5:30 Sunday a.m. to help
clean up. For the Army, Roble,
name it and it's yours. And so to
finals and furlough while Winnie
winds it up for the WAC.
IT THE MILL —Will we ever forget?
. . . the orders last January send
ing us to Stanford—on two hours'
notice, of course . , . getting off at
Paly at G a.m. one rainy Sunday . . .
the G1 who took us to our new home
and told us we were to live in tents
until our barracks were completed
. . . those first quarter schedules with
22 units and a thousand labs . . .
being introduced to that place called
anatomy and asking meekly: "Do
we have to stay here all afternoon?"
And we did! . . . that first pass to
San Francisco . . . those first final
exams . . . spring furlough . . . those
exercise groups in the dayroom, for
therapeutic purposes
And now that our six months here
is almost over, we're looking for
ward to: the orders telling us where
to next ... a long train ride—home,
we hope ... a few days minus rev
eille. Such sweet thoughts.
Quarter windup for the Jiver, so
let's make mention of credits. Credit
Dr. Popper with much of the suc
cess enjoyed by the bund; his per
sonality and line musicianship have
lifted them above themselves. Thank
unsung Jim Walters, without whose
help the ASC dances and swing ses
sions could never have been held.
Thank Stanley Sharp for Ihe co
operation in obtaining facilities for
student functions. There are many
others, too, whom you don't hear
about, without whom life at Stan
ford would be dreary.

B.J. leads with a salt shaker to the
head, Samuel counters with a sugar
bowl to the chest and stomach. B.J.
feints with a left and comes up with
a right lipstick jab to the face. Sam
uel connects with lefts and rights to
the chin for a KO in 1:03 of the first
round. The winnah and new pow
der weight champ!
