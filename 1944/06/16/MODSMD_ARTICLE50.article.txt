An Open Letter to the Regiment
There were lots of questions at the beginning of this quarter on the
topic "What has the Army Student Council done?" Therefore, even though
our actions have all been out in the open and fairly well publicized, I
want to submit for your approval the following excerpts from our minutes
in the form of a quarterly report. Then each of you individually and
collectively can decide if the Council has accomplished any ob its objectives
as laid down in its charter.
The elections at the beginning of the term returned Fletcher and Al
dridge as the only old members, and for many of the representatives from
C Company, it was their first quarter on the Stanford campus. The council
first started its official business by electing Ralph Aldridge as president.
Tom Fletcher as vice-president, Ben Goodman as secretary and Stan
Bahnsen as treasurer.
In order to get the publicity ball rolling Lee Welco was appointed as
editor of the Daily Army Page. He and his stall deserve a big pat on the
back for the splendid job which they have done all quarter on this page in
presenting interesting as well as informative copy.
Don Bluh was re-appointed as the Council's "Dan Cupid" in social
affairs. The "blind date" organization was again set up with many men
taking immediate advantage of it. With the co-operation of Cathy Hauser,
Don arranged the Thursday night dancing lessons which have proved so
popular.
Mike Donohue was elected head of the athletic committee, and he im
mediately got on the job and organized a ping pong tournament and a soft
ball league to follow up the previous quarter's basketball and volleyball
leagues. Aldridge of Company A barely beat off the slams of C Company's
Noel for the regimental ping pong championship. A $6 and a $4$ award
were given respectively. Due to difficulties in scheduling games, the soft
ball championship will not hs played off until next week at which time it
will be determined which etam will receive a year's subscription to Yank
magazine. In this match will be Company A's unbeaten Japanese Trans
lators against an as yet undetermined C Company aggregation.
Shortly before our first exarrts haunted us the Honor Code and proctor
systems of examination conduct were discussed and voted upon. With one
exception the proctor system was put into effect.
To assist the able leadership of Dr. Popper and Lt. Morgan with the
Stanford Army Band. Melvin Feldman was appointed as trainee band
manager. A financial agreement was also worked out with the University
which enabled the band to expand its membership, alter the civilian band
uniforms and keep the horns in good tooting order. Dr. Popper and his
organization have performed a marvelous job in playing for the parades
and other University and military functions.
Through the urging of Vice-President Fletcher the PX agreed to lay in
the supply of magazines that you now find on sale there. Also through the
co-operation of Mr. Sharp a little more heat was arranged for Encina dur
ing the day-time study periods.
Alter quite a discussion with the Council, Col. Eden rescinded his order
prohibiting the closing of study room doors in Encina during the night
study periods. Also, with the Commandant and the Council working in
close co-operation, the present system of free hours on Wednesday arid
Friday nights was arranged. We feel that this is one of our outstanding
achievements of the quarter.
As the Army's part in the Sophomore Carnival in order to get money
for the Stanford Convalescent Home, Glen Mitchell was put in charge, and
a golf driving range was set up. The attempt at busting light bulbs proved
to be quite enjoyable to the golfers as well as lucrative for the Con Home.
A little more incentive for the eouncilmen to get to the meetings on
time was added on May 30 when Evelyn Walter was welcomed as the new
WAC rpresentative on the Council.
A sum of approximately $40 was appropriated by the ASC for ex
penditure on equipment for the newly organized AST dance orchestra.
Since that appropriation, the orchestra has proved very popular in its two
engagements in the day room on Wednesday nights and during the in
formal free dances in the Pavilion on Friday between 8 and 10. The Red
Cross also was prevailed upon to help with the orchestra.
The Army's "Hellzapoppin" dance last Saturday was a function that
took a month of work and planning in addition to a lot of last-minute
sweat; however, according to the many highly favorable remarks, it was
worth the effort. A huge bouquet of posies goes to A 1 DeSanctis for his
general organization and to Sloane and LaPlante for their decorations. The
appreciative efforts of many Gl's, WACs, civilian girls and one civilian man
were put together to make this the most outstanding dance at Stanford for
some time. Because the ticket price was kept purposely low for every
one's pocketbook, the dance dug into the Council's treasury for another $52.
Closing up the quarter, Councilman Elliott Wilson has taken charge of
the Fifth War Loan Drive and has been doing a bang-up job with the help
of Sid Rittenb?rg and others.
During the quarter the Council has performed numerous menial jobs
too numerous to mention. We have also attempted other major actions
without success—zut never without a dteermined effort. I feel that the
Council has made definite strides this quarter in making everyone's tour
of duty at this post more enjoyazle: however, I agree that there is much
more that can be accomplished by future councils for not everything can
be done at once.
Whether our actions as a body deserve praise, we leave it up to you
to decide; nevertheless, I feel that the regiment is indebted to the council
men as individuals for the ceaseless efforts that they have put out without
a whimper on their own time for the common good. The trainees are fur
ther indebted to Col. John R. Eden for the patient and undersatnding ear
with which he has listened to the Council's pleadings and for the fine
spirit of democratic interest he has shown in the men of his command.
In closing, I want to personally thank each member of the Council, the
trainees as a whole, the commissioned officers and some of the University
officials and civilian student body lor their suggestions, assistance and
co-operation.
—Ralph E. Aldridge
ASC President
