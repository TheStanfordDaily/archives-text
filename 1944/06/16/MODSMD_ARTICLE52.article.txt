###

Sharing the spotlight, from the G.I.
angle, is the Jap Translator-Med
fracas to satisfy the supposed cam
pus supremacy question. The Navy
Medmen waltzed off with civilian
intramural honors behind Wayne
Price's fireball and (he Japs met little
resistance in the Army 'A" loop.
Schedule Completed
With 'A" Co.'s schedule completed
, "C" Co. had a relatively busy week.
Last Thursday night the Texans
buried the Section Sixers under a
15-3 barrage and the B.P. Com
mandos grabbed the league lead with
a 12-10 nod over the Chow Hounds.
Sacks Tie
Monday night saw the Sad Sacks
make their successful bid for a first
place tie by handing the Sec. Sixers
a 5-4 lacing. Mike Sulak's late dou
ble chasing in two runners and Bob
Wayman's two-base rap provided the
necessary margin.
Swim Meet
Saturday afternoon the all-campus
swim meet will get under way at 1
p.m. sharp. Signs of a much larger
representation than last time and
adequate preparation point to a keen
four-cornered water fight. "A" Co.'s
hopes of repeating its earlier victory
rest on A 1 Beale, breaststroke ace.
Cozens and Castle will spearhead the
favored "C" Co. swimmers. Mar
quette's diving and Bruce Jessup's
free styling are the best the Meds and
Civies have to offer.
Efficiency Tests
What's the meaning of the ambu
lance fleet parked in the vicinity of
Angell Field? The sound of creaking
joints and gasping breaths tell the
tragic tale . . . it's physical fitness
time once again.
Choice of Sport
A new goal spurs the G.I. muscle
men to pitch in and fatten previous
scores. A total of 585 points entitles
the participant to choose next quar
ter's physical torture method and
perhaps escape the honor of jabbing
at Lindskog or grappling with
Mumby.

scores. A total of 585 points entitles
the participant to choose next quar
ter's physical torture method and
perhaps escape the honor of jabbing
at Lindskog or grappling with
Mumby.
With "C" Co.'s championship as the
prize, the two top/lighters—the Third
Platoon Sad Sacks and the Fourth's
B.P. Commandos—will battle it out
on the Sunken Diamond tomorrow
evening.
Japs Share Spotlight
Sharing the spotlight, from the G.I.
angle, is the Jap Translator-Med
fracas to satisfy the supposed cam
pus supremacy question. The Navy
Medmen waltzed off with civilian
intramural honors behind Wayne
Price's fireball and (he Japs met little
resistance in the Army 'A" loop.
Schedule Completed
With 'A" Co.'s schedule completed
, "C" Co. had a relatively busy week.
Last Thursday night the Texans
buried the Section Sixers under a
15-3 barrage and the B.P. Com
mandos grabbed the league lead with
a 12-10 nod over the Chow Hounds.
Sacks Tie
Monday night saw the Sad Sacks
make their successful bid for a first
place tie by handing the Sec. Sixers
a 5-4 lacing. Mike Sulak's late dou
ble chasing in two runners and Bob
Wayman's two-base rap provided the
necessary margin.
Swim Meet
Saturday afternoon the all-campus
swim meet will get under way at 1
p.m. sharp. Signs of a much larger
representation than last time and
adequate preparation point to a keen
four-cornered water fight. "A" Co.'s
hopes of repeating its earlier victory
rest on A 1 Beale, breaststroke ace.
Cozens and Castle will spearhead the
favored "C" Co. swimmers. Mar
quette's diving and Bruce Jessup's
free styling are the best the Meds and
Civies have to offer.
Efficiency Tests
What's the meaning of the ambu
lance fleet parked in the vicinity of
Angell Field? The sound of creaking
joints and gasping breaths tell the
tragic tale . . . it's physical fitness
time once again.
Choice of Sport
A new goal spurs the G.I. muscle
men to pitch in and fatten previous
scores. A total of 585 points entitles
the participant to choose next quar
ter's physical torture method and
perhaps escape the honor of jabbing
at Lindskog or grappling with
Mumby.
