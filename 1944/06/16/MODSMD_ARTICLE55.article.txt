# Dabblers Play at Pavilion Tonight

C
Lee Welco, ASC public relations
chairman, announces another free |
all-campus dance to be held at the ;
basketball pavilion tonight from 8
to 10.
Dabblers Furnish Music
Music will be furnished by Jack j
Hcrr's Dabblers in Swing. The first !
of these dances (which the ASC
plans to continue next quarter) was j
give nlast Friday in opening the j
Fifth War Loan drive at Stanford.
Attendance Last Week Poor
Attendance at that dance was not |
up to par, due mainly to other j
campus activities and the lack ol
sufficient dancing partners for those I
who came.
Bond Sales Good
Despite poor attendance, however,
over $400 worth of bonds and stamps
were .sold. Tonight will be another j
bond selling affair, and a goal of
$1000 has been set as a minimum.
Since these are no-date, cut-in j
dances, Stanford girls are especially j
urged to come and not make a lie j
of the ratio. The floor is being spe- j
cially groomed and the music will ;
set your feet tapping. Military au- 1
thorities and school officials have j
joined forces with the ASC in mak- !
ing possible an affair which should j
be the high spot of the week's recre
ation.
Get out of your stuffy room, shed
the hermit life, and treat yourself I
to a good time listening and dancing <
at lh<> Pavilion TONIGHT!
