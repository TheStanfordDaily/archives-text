### ROGER CORMAN 
As we sat around in the sports
office yesterday afternoon waiting
for the dummy to come out, we be
gan to realize that this was an epic
event. Not only were we working on
our last sports page, but this was
the first time all quarter that the
entire sports staff was together and
working at the same time.
Dick Block was bulling his way
through a basketball resume, Joe
Zukin was doing the same for foot
ball, Bill Adams the same for base
ball, Johnny Figg-Hoblyn was slav
ing over a swimming pre, and I
was leisurely trying to think of
something to put in my last column
as sports editor.
Usually the retiring sports editor
spends his last column looking back
over the quarter, and giving advice
to the poor sucker who's taking over
his job. Today, however, the rest of
the staff has the job of reviewing the
year in sports, and there's no incom
ing editor to congratulate and ad
vise.
Out of the five-man sports staff
that has held forth this quarter, not
a single writer will be back this
summer. At this wiiting there are
two possibilities for the editorship.
Ed Luce, formei sports editor and
member of autumn quarter's famed
board of sports experts, may find
the time to handle the page on the
two issues a week schedule planned
for the summer.
Other possibility is Phil Cagan,
present sports editor of the Beverly
Hills Highlights, who graduates from
high school this month and comes
up to the Farm next month.
I'd like to thank the members of
the staff who put in so much work
at the Shack this volume and really
handled the lion's share of the work.
Block and Zukin were a darn good
set of assistants, while Adams and
Figg-Hoblyn did an excellent job
as reporters.
And to whoever takes over next
quarter—good luck.
