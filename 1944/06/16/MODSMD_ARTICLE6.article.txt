# Stanford Sales Lag In Fifth War Loan Drive, Total $8,622
## 
### 
Sales of war stamps and bonds this week on campus for the Fifth War
Loan have been very poor, announced Bev Andreuccetti, stamp sales chair
man. A goal was set for $25,000, but it is doubtful whether a quarter of this
will be bought.
Today is the last day of the bond drive, and tonight's SCU dance in the

Pavilion will be students' last op
portunity to help Stanford reach its
quota in the Fifth Yar Loan.

Any student, senior, junior, or
lower division, can become a mem
ber of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation by buying a $50 bond (at
actual cost of $37.50) and present
ing it to the association. This will
constitute a lite membership,
which, if paid in cash, costs $50.

This drive is purely voluntary but
students should realize, especially
now, that Allied forces have started
the European invasion, that (here is
more need than ever for Americans
to invest in their government and
help win the war.
By buying stamps and bonds stu
dents have a chance to personally
help in the invasion. The quarters
that are used to buy war stamps help
provide ammunition for American
forces overseas.

A total amount of $8,022.85 in
stamps and bonds has been bought
so far in the bond drive. Of this
total $5,505.25 was bought by the
army students, announced Bev
Andreuccetti. The army total is
not yet complete.

Everyone is invited to attend the
SCU dance in the Pavilion tonight,
from 9 to 12. A booth will be set up
to sell war stamps. The bond drive
started last Friday night at the first
Friday night dance sponsored by
army students in the Pavilion. Sales
last week were very successful.
The bond booth will be open for
the last time today. Students, fac
ulty members, and University em
ployees are all urged to stop on their
way by the Cellar corner and buy a
bond or a stamp.
Any students who would like to
join the Alumni Association at a
saving of $12.50, may buy a $50 "F"
war bond today in the association's
name and become a life member.
Seniors especially are urged to take
advantage of this opportunity.
The final results of this week's
drive will be posted in the Cellar the
beginning of next week after they are
tabulated. This tabulation will also
include the sales of stamps in wom
en's living groups yestexday.
