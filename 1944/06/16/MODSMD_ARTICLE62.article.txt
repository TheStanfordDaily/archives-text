## Football Season Sees Co. L, F.A. Fake Title 
### JOE ZUKIN 
Even though Stanford's Cardinals
were absent from (he gridiron last
football season, the stadium and the
practice fields were taken over by
28 mural teams which played six
man touch football for seven nip
and-tuck weeks.
The 28 squads were divided into
two leagues, with most of the Army
teams in one league and a majority
of the civilian teams in the other,
fn the "A" league, judging by po
tential stlength, it looked as though
Dinah's had the favorite spot, with
the Firehouse, Navy, and Fillmore
right behind them. The *'B" league
was a hard one to pick, for it was
composed mostly of the Army
teams.
In the first encounter of the
season Navy and Firehouse came
through as expected and took the
Theta Hashers and Monroe into
camp by sizable scores.
In the second round of the season
Dinah's eliminated Fillmore from a
possible league win by downing
them 30-0. Firehouse kept in the
running by beating Adams 24-6. Lo
ren LaPrade, Hy Herbert, and Botch
Caruso all contributed to Dinah's
easy win.
By the time the third round had
rolled around, four teams had taken
the spotlight, all with clean records
and good teams to back them up.
Firehouse with three wins and no
losses, and Dinahs, McKinley, and
Fightin' QM, an Army team, with
two wins and no losses. McKinley
and Fightin' QM had heretofore been
unnoticed, but as the season pro
gressed they gained much more at-

I tent ion.
One of the biggest upsets of the
year, if not the biggest, was when
underdog McKinley came through
and beat Dinah's by a score of 24-18.
"Tugger" Neville, who is now in the
| Navy V-5 program, proved to be the
I spark of the McKinley attack as lie
] ran a kick-off back for a touchdown
and passed for two others. Fire
house remained undefeated up to
J this point and still at the top of the
league.
Afte six games had been played
the league was in a wild scramble,
i Underrated Fightin' QM had come
through and nosed Firehouse out of
the top position. McKinley had lost
j to Navy, thus putting the Army team
j at the top of the heap, closely fol
lowed by Firehouse and McKinley
! with one loss apiece.
I In one of the most thrilling games
of the season, Dinah's downed Fire
| house, but then went on to be de
! feated by the Fightin' QM squad.
| Then with no defeats and nine wins
to their record, the Army team took
on Navy in a game which was to
decide the league championship.
The two teams battled to a 12-12
deadlock and then Fightin' QM went
on to defeat McKinley by a scorc of
18-0.
In the "B" league Co. LFA had
wound up on top with one defeat to
their credit and a big game was
planned between them and Fightin'
QM, the only undefeated team in
either league. But QM didn't show
up and LFA was crowned king of
the mural football season. That was
i the end, so here's the end of this
... 30.

The two teams battled to a 12-12

18-0.
In the "B" league Co. LFA had
wound up on top with one defeat to
their credit and a big game was
planned between them and Fightin'
QM, the only undefeated team in
either league. But QM didn't show
up and LFA was crowned king of

Even though Stanford's Cardinals
were absent from (he gridiron last
football season, the stadium and the
practice fields were taken over by
28 mural teams which played six
man touch football for seven nip
and-tuck weeks.
The 28 squads were divided into
two leagues, with most of the Army
teams in one league and a majority
of the civilian teams in the other,
fn the "A" league, judging by po
tential stlength, it looked as though
Dinah's had the favorite spot, with
the Firehouse, Navy, and Fillmore
right behind them. The *'B" league
was a hard one to pick, for it was
composed mostly of the Army
teams.
In the first encounter of the
season Navy and Firehouse came
through as expected and took the
Theta Hashers and Monroe into
camp by sizable scores.
In the second round of the season
Dinah's eliminated Fillmore from a
possible league win by downing
them 30-0. Firehouse kept in the
running by beating Adams 24-6. Lo
ren LaPrade, Hy Herbert, and Botch
Caruso all contributed to Dinah's
easy win.
By the time the third round had
rolled around, four teams had taken
the spotlight, all with clean records
and good teams to back them up.
Firehouse with three wins and no
losses, and Dinahs, McKinley, and
Fightin' QM, an Army team, with
two wins and no losses. McKinley
and Fightin' QM had heretofore been
unnoticed, but as the season pro
gressed they gained much more at-

One of the biggest upsets of the
year, if not the biggest, was when
underdog McKinley came through
and beat Dinah's by a score of 24-18.
