# Review in Introspect of '44 Intramural Diamond Season
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
Although Stanford fielded no
teams for intercollegiate competi
tion in 1943-44, Farm students con
tinued to show a lively interest in
sports during the spring quarter,
when 11 men's teams turned out for
intramural diamond competition. In
terest picked up considerably from
basketball season, and there were
not more than seven or eight de
faults during the entire season.
The league season opened on
Wednesday, April 6, with the intra
mural game of the century, in which
Monroe and the Firehouse fought il
out to a seven-inning 0-to-0 draw.
Neither Joe Sher of Monroe nor
Luke Pitts of the Firehouse allowed
a single hit, and both received mar
velous support from their fielders.
No errors were made by either team
during the game. Although Mon
roe slumped to fifth place later in
the season, the two pitchers went on
to become a couple of the best in
the league. On this same day the
Med School started its undefeated
pennant march by defeating Me-
Kinley, and Buchanan began its un

broken losing streak, bowing to Lin
coln Hall. It proved to be the hill
toppers' only win of the year also.
Tyler beat the Legal Eagles, and
Gerona postponed its game with
Hayes.
After such 'an auspicious begin
ning, it appeared as if Monroe or
Firehouse would certainly take the
pennant, but such did not prove to
be the case. As the season pro
gressed, (lie Navy Med School came
out of nowhere to sweep the league
clean and capture the pennant away
out in front of the rest of the league.
The doctors had good pitching, hard
hitters, and undoubtedly the most
smoothly co-ordinated fielding team
in the circuit.
The perennially powerful Fire
house lived up to expectations be
hind the amazing pitching of Luke
Pitts and Tom Ashley, and ran an
undisputed second to the Navy. The
Firemen had some tremendous hit
ters to add to their aggregation of
fielding stars.
Hayes Hall upset the dope bucket
completely by coming in third in the
competition. The S.A.E. boys owed
their success mainly to the hurling
efforts of Smoke Morrison, who car
ried the team on his shoulders dur
ing most of the season.
Gerona, with smooth fielding and
good hitting, popped up in fourth
place at the end of the season. Their
losses were mostly due to defaults.
The only other team in the league
that showed exceptional talent was
Monroe,' but Ihe Boozers dropped
so far in the standings during the
absence of pitcher Sher that they
were never able to overcome the
deficit.
In the rest of the league, Tyler,
MeKinley, Garfield, Legal Eagles,
Lincoln, and Buchanan came in in
that order.
