### DICK BLOCK 
Editor Roger Corman walked up
to yours truly the other night and
said, "How about writing up the
intramural basketball season, Dick?
'Tis your last article for quite a
time, chuckle, so make it a bang-up
job."
I wa. 1 more than pleased to do this
little thing for Rog, so I buzzed over
to the Daily, and prepared to dive
into the files of last quarter's edi
tions. Much to my dismay I learned
that some jovial character had con
tributed the issues to the Victory
Paper Drive, or had escaped with
the lucrative prize, and had hidden
them as would a pirate of bygone
days.
I cannot say I blame the person
for doing this, because after all the
Daily has great significance, and it
is a valuable possession. So, that is
how the situation stands; they arc
gone, so I will have to do as best I
can, committing most of my facts
from the golden pages of memory.
Games were played every night
except Friday during the week.
Four contests were held each eve
ning, two at 7:15, one in the pavilion
and the other in Encina Gym. The
other games were played in like
manner at 8:15.
The league was composed of the
following teams: Roble Hashers, Me-
Kinley A and B, Firehouse, Fillmore,
Lincoln, Med School, Cleveland, Bu
chanan, Gerona A C., Monroe, Ty

ler, Adams, Hayes, Arthur, and
Washington.
Roblc established itself at the top
of the league from the very begin
ning. Other teams that got of! on
the right foot were Firehouse, Fill
more, and the famous M.H.P.D.B,
quintet, McKinley A, who only
dropped about three encounters for
the season.
The Roble Hashers were led by
"Bones" Halstead of varsity fame.
Tiny Leon Watson, a star prepster
from St. George, Utah, and his pint
sized buddy, Jim Travis, were the
best forwards in the business.
McKinley A created havoc with
many potential championship teams,
led by Tom Martzlof, Doug Horner,
John Ehrlich, Todd Hclser, and Bob
Donahoe. If our memory can be
trusted McKinley lost to Roblc, Fill
more, and Firehouse.
Firehouse stayed near the top of
the listings; Fillmore, sparked by
Louis Fcntnor, was an evil menace
to the other teams in the league;
Med School was also one of the
stronger ol the lot; Gcrona was al
ways a threat, and the other teams
in the league were strong, but not
strong enough.
As we sum up the happenings of
the intramural basketball season the
overwhelming superiority of the
Roble Hashers is clearly seen. They
were in a class by themselves, which
was proved by their vanquishing all
the civilian teams by huge margins,
and then trouncing the Army Co. D
champs in a special post-league
playofT.
