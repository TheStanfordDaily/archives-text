# Conglomeration of Events To Feature Campus Field Day
## 
### 
In view of Ihe great amount of
interest shown in the last All-Cam
pus Field Day, another has been
scheduled for the evening of Wed
nesday, June 21, at (i o'clock. This
All-University Field Day is to be
a sort of melting pot for all the
.sports left out of intramural com
petition. A combination of boxing,
wrestling, track, and an innumerable
variety of miscellaneous, unclassi
fiable events will feature the meet.
Team or Individual Affair?
No verification as to whether this
field day is to be a team affair, as
was the last, or whether it is to be
one of individual competition has yet
been discovered by the Daily sports
staff. However, if the meet is to be
of team competition, the civilians
are favored to repeat their decisive
win over the Army and the Med
School.
Two boxing matches, one to decide
who will be the civilian champ, the
other to determine the Army title
holder, will be conducted as events
in this Field Day. In the same man
ner two wrestling matches will be
scheduled lor determining the Army
and civilian championships. There
will also be a bicycle race, 440 yards
in duration.
The track events will probably
consist of the same type as beforeâ€”
a 220, 440, two relays, and a few
miscellaneous events such as the
sack race. The addition of a mile to
this assortment is still under argu
ment. All prospective entrants
should make application early next
week.
