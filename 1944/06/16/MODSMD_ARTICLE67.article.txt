# Dr. Lanz Explains Russ Government
## 
### 
Henry Lanz, professor of Slavis
languages and philosophy, spoke yes
terday to the members of the "Y"
World Affairs group on the govern
mental situation in Russia today, and
the manner in which it is being ap
plied to the everyday lives of its
varigated peoples.
Professor Lanz stated that politics
in Russia are more ethical and more
practical than the principle of domi
nance employed by their neighbor,
Germany.
He added that the southern and
northern parts of Europe and Asia
should be considered as separate
continents culturally, and that war
came about in the northern continent
because the two principles of gov
ernment cannot exist side by side.
