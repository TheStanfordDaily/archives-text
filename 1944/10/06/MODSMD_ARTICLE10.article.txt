# Bull Session

### Dick Crane 
To all of you students entering Stanford for the first time, here are a few
of the things about the place, which may seem rather strange to you at
first, will become merely routine with the passing of time.
If you happen to hear screams of agony, low moans of grief, and see nu
merous long faces in the general direction of the P.O. (Post Office), think
nothing of it, as il is merely the coming of the morning mail, or should I j
say "no mail."
The mass exodous of people in the general direction of the "Cellar," ;
about 10:00 A.M., is not a crowd gathering to hear someone giving out on
the comparative merits of Dewey for President (Plug), but merely to
gather for the "coffee hour" at which time the S.R.O. sign is hung outside !
the door. You will hear such chatter as, "I've just time for one rubber
before class," or "Luke Pitts has really got the "hots" for her, or "My God. I
don't you ever buy any cigarettes?"
You will notice all of the old male students wearing "jeans." Don't worry, {
hey are not all here on scholarships, it is merely the campus wearing ap
parel. The "baggy" sweaters on the girlg are not worn to lit the personality,
'3ii I just everyday campus clothes.
These are just a few of the things that happen on this fair campus, which
I am sure you will learn to love. So I bid you welcome, and if I should hear
someone sav. "Gad, that Bull Session really stinks!" I will know you are
(earning fast.
