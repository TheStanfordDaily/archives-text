# Hall History Told as Women Enter Brainier
## 
### PATTY PATTEN 
The 130 women who enter Bran- j
ner Hall this Fall Quarter will live
in a building erected to the memory
of John Casper Branner, Stanford's i
second president.
A scientist at heart. Dr. Branner i
was one of Stanford's finest scholars
and most beloved teachers. Serving
on the first faculty ol the University, j
he was head of the Department of |
Geology and Mining, Vice-President |
of the University, and finally Presi
dent.
Dr. Branner was born in a rural
area of Tennessee in 1850, and as |
schools were scarce and books few, ;
he developed a deep interest in the :
natural features of the country sur- j
rounding him which he retained
throughout his life.
Explored Brazil
While an undergraduate at Cornell
University he was asked to partici
pate in a geological survey of Brazil.
This was the first of many trips he 1
made to Brazil, and the world owes 1
much of its geologic and scientific
knowledge of Brazil to Dr. Branner's
surveys.
When David Starr Jordan became
president of ihe University of Indi
ana in 1885 he appointed Dr. Bran
ner to the professorship of Geology
at that institution, a position which
Dr. Branner held until he was called
by Dr. Jordan to the faculty of Stan
ford University. In the meantime he
acted as State Geologist of Arkansas.
From 1891 until his retirement
from Stanford in 1915, Dr. Branner
was head of the Department of Geol
ogy and Mining. He was Vice-Presi
dent of the University from 1898 un
til 1913, at which time he was elected
President.
Widely Known
His scientific service was widely ;
recognized during his lifetime: he |
was a member of the National Acad
emv of Sciences, the American Philo- j
sophical Society, President of the I
American Geological Society, Vice-
President of the American Associa- 1
tion for the Advancement of Science, !
and held memberships in the Geo- j
logical Societies of London, Edin
burgh, and France.
Dr. Branner was one of the last of !
the scientists who were learned in j
many branches of natural history. j
before intense specialization com
pelled men to confine themselves to j
narrow lines of scientific investiga
tion.
In addition to his work as a sci- j
entist, however, he was a linguist of
remarkable ability, a great educator, j
and a leader of men. His own sys
tematic and untiring research com- |
bined with his realization of the j
supreme importance of practical ex
perience as the final test of all theo- j
ries. inspired his students to their j
best efforts.
Loyalty, honor, and a constant j
search for truth perhaps best sum- i
marize the character of Stanford's \
great educator and scientist.
