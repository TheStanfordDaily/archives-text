# Tuesday Series To Show Famous French Film
## 
### 
A French sound film with English sub-titles, "A Nous La Liberte," will
be shown next Tuesday (Oct. 10) at 7:30 P.M. in the auditorium of Me
morial Hall at Stanford.
The public is invited to attend this movie which marks the opening
event of the fall quarter Tuesday Evening Series sponsored by the Univer
sity Committee on Public Exercises. No admission will be charged.
'"A Nous La Liberte," the brightest and deepest of Rene Clair's great
comic films, is a satire on modern society and big business. It is a happy
ballad of the liberties not permitted by the modern world, either to its
failures or to its commercial successes.
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, head of the Division of Journalism at Stanford, is
serving as director of the University Committee on Public Exercises for the
fall quarter in the absence of Hubert C. Heffner, head of Speech and Drama.
