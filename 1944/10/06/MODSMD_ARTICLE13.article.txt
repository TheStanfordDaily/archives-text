# It's All Over But the Shooting, Girls!
## 
### PEGGY STERN 
There is nobody quite so super
cilious as the second quarter Fresh
man, who. having withstood the
agonies of her first quarter of new
ness and strangeness, of fears'and
failures, of shocks and surprises, now
emerges worldly wise in the ways of
Stanford, to smile with indulgence
at the trials and tribulations of the
next crop of eager, wide-eyed Fresh
man novices.
The life of a first quarter Fresh
man is fdled with adventures, some
pleasant, some riot-so-pleasant, but
all exciting and new and different.
When she enters Stanford she enters
a new world, a matrix in which the
four years of her life are to
take place. No wonder she is filled
with mingled emotions of terror and
delight, of dread and joyous antici
pation as she beholds for the first
time the panorama of Stanford with
its low, rambling, old brown stone
Spanish buildings spread out be
fore her. Questions, doubts, fears,
flash through her mind, she experi
ences the sensation of feeling butter
flies in the pit of her stomach, and
she closes her eyes tightly for a mo
ment and utters a silent prayer,
''Please God, let me like it here, and
let them like me!"
They Do
Her cab pulls up before imposing,
ivy covered Roble Hall. Out rush
three friendly girls with shining faces
and laughing eyes, and ask her if

| they can help with her luggage. Her
! feelings of tenseness and uneasiness
i are momentarily swept away as her
I new friends, chattering furiously,
outdo themselves in their efforts to
j make her feel at home.
She "sets up housekeeping" in her
j new room, transforming it into a
cheery, homey place. Just as she
has hung her last curtain, she hears
I a timid knock at the door, and at her
i invitation to enter a small, skinny,

meek looking creature slinks into the |
room. "I--I'm to be your r—room- I
mate!" the frightened little soul ven
tures.
Suddenly our heroine feels as if
she is a veteran Stanford student! |
Imagine, someone more frightened j
than she! She introduces herself to i
the timid soul and tries to put her at ;
ease. Soon the two girls are fast j
friends, and about this time comes j
another knock at the door. "I'm the '

sponsor," announces the newcomer
upon being bidden to enter, "how
: would you girls like to go on a tour
1 of the Farm?"
Join the Hand
No sooner said than done; our
i heroine joins the group of fifty or
more Freshmen who are getting their
| first glimpse of the wonders of the
I Stanford Farm, At each stop she is
more impressed with this glorious
: place—the magnificent Hoover Li
brary, the awe inspiring chape], the
i beautiful green amphitheater all fill
' her with a sense of pride and loyalty
' about Stanford, her Stanford. Sud

denly, the group begins singing the
strains of "Come Join the Band," all
her doubts and fears disappear and
she feels herself no longer a stranger,
but a vital part of this great new life
which she has entered.

next crop of eager, wide-eyed Fresh
man novices.
The life of a first quarter Fresh
man is fdled with adventures, some
pleasant, some riot-so-pleasant, but
all exciting and new and different.
When she enters Stanford she enters
a new world, a matrix in which the
four years of her life are to
take place. No wonder she is filled
with mingled emotions of terror and
delight, of dread and joyous antici
pation as she beholds for the first
time the panorama of Stanford with
its low, rambling, old brown stone
Spanish buildings spread out be
fore her. Questions, doubts, fears,
flash through her mind, she experi
ences the sensation of feeling butter
flies in the pit of her stomach, and
she closes her eyes tightly for a mo
ment and utters a silent prayer,
''Please God, let me like it here, and
let them like me!"
They Do
Her cab pulls up before imposing,
ivy covered Roble Hall. Out rush
three friendly girls with shining faces
and laughing eyes, and ask her if

| they can help with her luggage. Her
! feelings of tenseness and uneasiness
i are momentarily swept away as her
I new friends, chattering furiously,
outdo themselves in their efforts to
j make her feel at home.
She "sets up housekeeping" in her
j new room, transforming it into a
cheery, homey place. Just as she
has hung her last curtain, she hears
I a timid knock at the door, and at her
i invitation to enter a small, skinny,

meek looking creature slinks into the |
room. "I--I'm to be your r—room- I
mate!" the frightened little soul ven
tures.
Suddenly our heroine feels as if
she is a veteran Stanford student! |
Imagine, someone more frightened j
than she! She introduces herself to i
the timid soul and tries to put her at ;
ease. Soon the two girls are fast j
friends, and about this time comes j
another knock at the door. "I'm the '

sponsor," announces the newcomer
upon being bidden to enter, "how
: would you girls like to go on a tour
1 of the Farm?"
Join the Hand
No sooner said than done; our
i heroine joins the group of fifty or
more Freshmen who are getting their
| first glimpse of the wonders of the
I Stanford Farm, At each stop she is
more impressed with this glorious
: place—the magnificent Hoover Li
brary, the awe inspiring chape], the
i beautiful green amphitheater all fill
' her with a sense of pride and loyalty
' about Stanford, her Stanford. Sud

denly, the group begins singing the
strains of "Come Join the Band," all
her doubts and fears disappear and
she feels herself no longer a stranger,
but a vital part of this great new life
which she has entered.
There is nobody quite so super
cilious as the second quarter Fresh
man, who. having withstood the
agonies of her first quarter of new
ness and strangeness, of fears'and
failures, of shocks and surprises, now
emerges worldly wise in the ways of
Stanford, to smile with indulgence
at the trials and tribulations of the
next crop of eager, wide-eyed Fresh
