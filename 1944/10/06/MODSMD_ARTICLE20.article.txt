# WAR FRONTS
## 
### Elliot Epsteen 
The Stanford Daily has recently been running a series of columns on war
war analysis, and, for the last quarter, this particular one has served the
function. It is written by an avid armchair strategist for other armchair
strategists, and it is an attempt to view present military developments in
the light of the established techniques and axioms of the profession at
arms. Also, in so far as is possible from a distance of many miles, it is an
attempt to predict future developments in light of what is happening now.
this particular department at present being, for the most part, reduced to
the Pacific. It is fundamentally an attempt at analysis, but, since it is
written by an amateur, it has the advantage of not being able to be one
hundred per cent authoritarian, and the author can be safely disagreed
with without the usual recourse of pointing to long professional training.
Thus, discussion is stimulated, and the interpretations of the news are only
one particular viewpoint on the course of events. The net effect will be
to provoke other, radical viewpoints, that might be completely different,
and even more important, to furnish a source of reasoning on these events
which .holds water only because of its own construction.
