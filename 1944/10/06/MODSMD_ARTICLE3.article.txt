# First Roble Mother Tells OS Old Days
## 
### 
Remembering 26 years of com
panionship with Stanford women, as
director of Roble Hall, Miss Ger
trude Gardiner nodded her grey
head and commented with a small,
dry chuckle, "In the early days they
all had to be good girls .... lights
went out at 10:30 every niyht with
out fail!"
Miss Gardiner was Ruble's "foster
mother" from the day the first women
moved into the building which is now
- Sequoia Hall. "Roble was what we
call 'a hurry-up job'," she said. "At
the very last minute before the open
ing of the new University, so many
! girls had applied for admission that
the administration decided that hous
ing facilities would have to be en
larged."
"Ninety days after the first brick
was laid, Roble was ready for the
women .... the paint was almost
still wet on its walls."
"Life in the early days was lots of
fun," she reminisced. "In fact, I think
maybe we had a better time than
some 'people do now in the modern
world. At least we didn't have to
worry about meat and cheese ration
ing."
