# President Greets New Students
## 
### 
At the opening the 54th academic
year at Stanford, I extend our warm
est greetings and friendly welcome
to students who are on the campus
for the first "time.
Stanford has a long tradition of
friendliness. Students and faculty
alike over the years have greeted
each other with a cheerful, "Hello.' :
New students coming to the campus,
I am sure, will readily accept this
custom and, thereby, perpetuate o
spirit of genuine friendliness.
We are proud of the many who
have gone from Stanford to make
notable contributions to the nation
and to the world. We are proud es
pecially right now of those who are
fighting valiantly in all corners of the
world for the cause of human free
dom. They are making it possible
for use to preserve that freedom
right here on the Stanford campus
which we have cherished for so many
years.
We must not for a moment forget
that we are still at war. The armed
forces need all the support we can
possibly give them. Until victory, not
only in Europe but in all parts of the
world, Stanford will continue to util -
ize to the utmost its resources—stuff,
classrooms, libraries, and laborato
ries—in carrying on the war.
At this time, however, we can see
victory ahead more clearly than Jt


Dr. TRESIDDEIi .... President
any period since the war started. We
must, therefore, keep in mind our
hopes for the better world for which
we are fighting. We must plan ac
cordingly. Just as trained and dis
ciplined minds have been essential
in carrying on the war so success
fully, they are essential for the peace.
Stanford has a staff of outstanding
scholars and teachers. They are here
to help educate you so that you can
take your place in carrying on the
technical phases of our civilization
and so that you will develop the hu
man qualities so essential for noble
living.
Whether you are here in one of the
Army Programs, or as a civilian, we
welcome you. We have full confi
dence in you, in what you will do
here at Stanford and after you leave
the campus. Our interests and our
hopes are in you. Our best wishes
go with you always.

forces need all the support we can
possibly give them. Until victory, not
only in Europe but in all parts of the
world, Stanford will continue to util -

Dr. TRESIDDEIi .... President
At the opening the 54th academic
year at Stanford, I extend our warm
est greetings and friendly welcome
to students who are on the campus
for the first "time.
Stanford has a long tradition of
friendliness. Students and faculty
alike over the years have greeted
each other with a cheerful, "Hello.' :
New students coming to the campus,
I am sure, will readily accept this
custom and, thereby, perpetuate o
spirit of genuine friendliness.
We are proud of the many who
have gone from Stanford to make
notable contributions to the nation
and to the world. We are proud es
pecially right now of those who are
fighting valiantly in all corners of the
world for the cause of human free
dom. They are making it possible
for use to preserve that freedom
right here on the Stanford campus
which we have cherished for so many
years.
We must not for a moment forget
that we are still at war. The armed
forces need all the support we can
possibly give them. Until victory, not
only in Europe but in all parts of the
world, Stanford will continue to util -
ize to the utmost its resources—stuff,
classrooms, libraries, and laborato
ries—in carrying on the war.

any period since the war started. We
must, therefore, keep in mind our
hopes for the better world for which

in carrying on the war so success
fully, they are essential for the peace.

scholars and teachers. They are here
