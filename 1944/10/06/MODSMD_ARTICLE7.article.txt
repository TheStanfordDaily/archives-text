# President Greets New Students
## 
### 
At the opening the 54th academic
year at Stanford, I extend our warm
est greetings and friendly welcome
to students who are on the campus
for the first "time.
Stanford has a long tradition of
friendliness. Students and faculty
alike over the years have greeted
each other with a cheerful, "Hello.' :
New students coming to the campus,
I am sure, will readily accept this
custom and, thereby, perpetuate o
spirit of genuine friendliness.
We are proud of the many who
have gone from Stanford to make
notable contributions to the nation
and to the world. We are proud es
pecially right now of those who are
fighting valiantly in all corners of the
world for the cause of human free
dom. They are making it possible
for use to preserve that freedom
right here on the Stanford campus
which we have cherished for so many
years.
We must not for a moment forget
that we are still at war. The armed
forces need all the support we can
possibly give them. Until victory, not
only in Europe but in all parts of the
world, Stanford will continue to util -
ize to the utmost its resources—stuff,
classrooms, libraries, and laborato
ries—in carrying on the war.
At this time, however, we can see
victory ahead more clearly than Jt
