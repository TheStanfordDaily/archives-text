# THIS IS THE DAILY
## 
### 
A a member of the Associated Students of Stanford University
you enjoy many privileges; and, many activities are conducted
in your name, among them publication of the Stanford Daily,
the humor magazine Chaparral, and the yearbook, Quad. This is
to tell you about the Daily, for you are a part owner-publisher,
contributing financially to this newspaper's support so that you

may have an outlet for your
opinions, publication of your ac
tivities, and a spokesman for
you in University affairs.
You have also, in a sense,
created a two-party system of
student government here at
Stanford, for although the stu
dent government is nonparti
san, and executive in nature,
the Daily at all times considers
the actions of our student gov
ernment. The Daily has been
known, on occasion, to disagree.
But the Daily is unlike your
high school or junior college or
college paper for the reason that
Stanford is Stanford and Stan
ford students are Stanford stu
dents. The geographical posi
tion of our University, the many

traditions and long history of good manners and friendship, have
served to establish a unique and friendly community. A com
munity of intellectual, physical and social endeavor, untouched
by many of the_ problems which beset many city institutions.
Consequently your student newspaper is shaped after the lo
cal situation; not according to the problems you left behind or
the problems you know about. You are fortunate in attending
a university which is singularly free of student problems, Uni
versity relationships, and so forth.
At Stanford you know what is going on because somebody
tells you or you read about it in the Daily. The Daily is pub
lished every day except Saturday and Sunday. You pick it up
at various campus distribution boxes at 7:45 each morning. It
contains campus news, news from United Press, sports, features,
the traditional and controversial column Bull Session, military
analysis in War Fronts, a women's page, news of army students,
editorials, and Campus Opinion. All unsigned editorials are by
the editor. Each letter intended for publication must be signed;
no pen names will be printed.
The staff of the Daily is made up of Stanford students who are
interested in learning about the University, meeting other stu
dents, making new friends, and having a pretty good time. It is
not necessary to be a journalism major to work on the Daily and
a tryoutee period will be held this week for those who are in
terested.
The famous green Shack is a part of Stanford; come on over
and get acquainted.

Editor Dave Davis .... this is the
Daily ....
A a member of the Associated Students of Stanford University
you enjoy many privileges; and, many activities are conducted
in your name, among them publication of the Stanford Daily,
the humor magazine Chaparral, and the yearbook, Quad. This is
to tell you about the Daily, for you are a part owner-publisher,
contributing financially to this newspaper's support so that you

may have an outlet for your
opinions, publication of your ac
tivities, and a spokesman for
you in University affairs.
You have also, in a sense,
created a two-party system of
student government here at
Stanford, for although the stu
dent government is nonparti
san, and executive in nature,
the Daily at all times considers
the actions of our student gov
ernment. The Daily has been
known, on occasion, to disagree.
But the Daily is unlike your
high school or junior college or
college paper for the reason that
Stanford is Stanford and Stan
ford students are Stanford stu
dents. The geographical posi
tion of our University, the many

traditions and long history of good manners and friendship, have
served to establish a unique and friendly community. A com
munity of intellectual, physical and social endeavor, untouched
by many of the_ problems which beset many city institutions.
Consequently your student newspaper is shaped after the lo
cal situation; not according to the problems you left behind or
the problems you know about. You are fortunate in attending
a university which is singularly free of student problems, Uni
versity relationships, and so forth.
At Stanford you know what is going on because somebody
tells you or you read about it in the Daily. The Daily is pub
lished every day except Saturday and Sunday. You pick it up
at various campus distribution boxes at 7:45 each morning. It
contains campus news, news from United Press, sports, features,
the traditional and controversial column Bull Session, military
analysis in War Fronts, a women's page, news of army students,
editorials, and Campus Opinion. All unsigned editorials are by
the editor. Each letter intended for publication must be signed;
no pen names will be printed.
The staff of the Daily is made up of Stanford students who are
interested in learning about the University, meeting other stu
dents, making new friends, and having a pretty good time. It is
not necessary to be a journalism major to work on the Daily and
a tryoutee period will be held this week for those who are in
terested.
The famous green Shack is a part of Stanford; come on over
and get acquainted.
