### 
The German escape route behind
Aachen was closed to a heavily bom
barded four mile strip, as twin of- i
fensives lashed the western battle
grounds behind Aachen. At Met./., to
the south, Yanks plunged ahead six
miles, seizing eight towns.
American forces plunged forward
pressing to the enemy's last road to
Cologne and a vise formed as more
troops from the Übach breakthrough
of the Siegfried line defenses.
The Aachen front stretched 30 I

miles while to the south the Third
Army struck at Mctz on a 20 mile
front.
In the north ground was lost
I around Fort Driant, despite bitter
fighting in that sector.
Tanks and guns combined in a
small task force which was fighting
on the outskirts of Aachen itself.
Aachcn is rated the 37th city of the
Reich, being the size of Nashville,
Tcnn., or Hartford, Conn. A little
more progress will cut ofT the city
I completely.
