# Girls Register But Wonder at Man Shortage
## 
### BETTY BARUCH 
Pity the poor freshman; not the
second quarter big shot who has been
through the perils of Reg Day, but
the first quarter neophyte who has
been cruely routed from sleep long
before dawn by some unthoughtful
sponsor.
Sleepily he, or she as the case usu
ally is, arises and prepares to go
j forth into a strange, unfriendly
I world. At the sound of tramping
feet and the ccho of the sponsor's
cry, she sct-s forth to brave the leg
endary terrors of the Ad Building.
She arrives.
She is staggered. In the murky
depths a struggling mass of human
j ity greets her half-opened eyes,
j Instead of the Stanford rough, of
I whom she has heard glowing talcs,
| she beholds the skirts and sweater
| of the Farm Squaw. The rough has
seen and (led. He will cat his break
fast in pcacc and then enter to re
ceive his passport to future fame.
I Make Checks To
As the terrifying sight penetrates
the consciousncss of the freshman,
the lines suddenly and ominously
moveforward. Caught in the press,
thcncophytc reaches to the window
where a little book of numerous
mysteries is handed to her.
She then finds herself free of one
coil, only to find herself forcefully
pushed into a second .... for the
first time she hears the memorable
motto of I?cg Day, "Make chccks
payable to Stanford University."
Long will this haunt her, though she
docs not realize it now.
After navigating innumerable lines
her head swims and her feet arc go
ing in automatic circles. She sud
denly finds herself at a desk where
a brisk hand snatches her book,
leafs quickly through it, tears out
most of its contents, and gives back
j the cover with a little stamped card
attached. Wearily detaching the card,
! as instructed to do by her ever
i present sponsor, she throws her book
J in the corner and trudges the rocky
uphill road toward the haven of her
room.
Where Is tlie Rough?
Gone now are the grand illusions
| of the smooth first day at Stanford.
] Still unanswered arc her questions:
' What arc her classcs like? Who are
her profs? What is the work like? Is
jit hard? What books will she need?
i And last, but not least, where is the
; famed Stanford Rough of which she
has heard such glowing tales? Willi
! a sigh she collapses on her bed or
floor and daydreams of the future.
The Rough is sitting calmly on the
hill at the top of the Row looking
| down at his Alma Mater. He pufTs
i his pipe and reflects upon the unex
| plorcd vistas that lie below him. At
! last his day has conic. He has his
pick of thousands of lovely women
and all the time in the world to get
I into action. Let the women wait.
Maybe the women are lucky at that.
