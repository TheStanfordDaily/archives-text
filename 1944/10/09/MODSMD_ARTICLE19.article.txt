# WENDELL L. WILLKIE
## 
### 
T!>' United States suffered a great loss Saturday night when
de 11 took Wendell L. Willkie, one of the foremost statesmen
of our time. His meteoric rise from an Indiana farm boy to the
Republican candidate for the presidency of the United States
is known to all. His contributions to the fields of politics, eco
nomics and international relations are egually well known.
, More important than this, in a world torn by strife and parti
san dissension, Willkie forgot all feelings of bitterness he may
have fell after the hard-fought campaign of 1940 and joined his
efforts with those of the present administration for the unification
of the country.
He set examples of unselfishness, honesty, and courage in the
midst of strict partisan politics. Never once did he falter, or go
back on any statement he made with reference to the betterment
of the country. He stood firm in his defense of his principles
iu the face of the severest criticism of his party. He never failed
to fight for those things he believed in. His death has come as
a great blow to the country which he served so nobly.
