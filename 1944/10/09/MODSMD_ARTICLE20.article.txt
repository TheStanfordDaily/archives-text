# STANFORD AND POLITICS
## 
### 
With a world war monopolizing public interest it is only nat
ural that attention to politics will wane. On a campus busy with
the mechanism of war it is not to be expected that our every
thought be occupied with the coming election and the issues
therein.
However we should not become engrossed in the progress
and completion of the war to the exclusion of our political prob
lems. After all, the officers elected in November will be the
ones administering for the duration and probably the first years
of the postwar period. And that is the period that will affect
us all so vitally and be a turning point for many of us.
Numerous freshmen boys will enter the Armed Forces after
completing a quarter or two at Stanford. Some of the women
v/ill enlist in the services too. The others will stay at home and
finish their educations. All of us, no matter of which group,
should have an active interest in today's politics. The outcome
of the near election will serve as a controlling factor in our
future lives.
To stimulate this interest, various groups are conducting dis
cussions of current and future problems. It is important that
everyone participate and become familiar with the mechanisms
and workings of the government.
Stanford has a reputation for lively political interest. It is
to our own advantage and to the advantage of the school to
uphold this reputation. For our own benefits now—as Stanford
is a working model of a democratic, political machine—and for
our own benefits later, when we are out of school and the officers
we choose affect our daily existence.
Let's get together and talk over the issues of today and to
morrow.
