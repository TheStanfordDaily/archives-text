# ADVICE TO THE LADIES
## 
### 
There are many ways in which each Stanford woman can
cooperate with the OPA to keep prices down. When she buys
a rug, bedspread, or a pair of drapes for her room and makes
certain that she is paying no more than the ceiling price, she is
helping herself and everyone else. The same rule applies to the
prices she pays for laundry and dry cleaning, for shoe repairs,
and for all other services which are covered by ceiling prices.
The OPA places ceiling prices and does its best to enforce
them, but after all, it is up to every one of us to see that we don't
violate the OPA rules. Make it a regular practice to know the cor
rect" ceiling price for any article or service you need and never to
pay more than this legal price.
Here are some more reminders from the OPA. Take good care
of those leather-soled moccasins—they now require shoe stamps.
Kven the soft ones meant for indoor wear are now on the rationed
list. Other "take care of" articles are light globes. The tungsten
<:nd nickel used in them are not available in very large quantities,
so it's up to us to make ours last as long as possible. Be sure
to turn off the light when you leave your room, and a friendly
reminder to the girls in the next room might save a few more
volts!
