# WAR FRONTS

### Elliot Epsteen 
The Battle of the Siegfried Line is developing into a difficult
test of skill between Field Marshal Von Model and General
Eisenhower. The former is trying to hold out as long as can,
assisted by reserves from Foland, while the latter is trying to
develop a crushing blow to end the war as soon as possible.
The weakness of the German position was displayed in the
beginning. The flanks were pushed forward, the right on the
Albert Canal and the left on the Moselle and the Vosges Moun
| tains, showing' that the whole Siegfried Line was more or less
I in air.
The first event of major importance came when General
| Hodges shoved a narrow shaft through the line south of Aachen,
or AixTa-Chapelle. This was accomplished with extreme ease,
probably because the German commander there had not yet
enough reinforcements to hold his line solidly and yet keep
enough in reserve to make an effective counterattack. He wisely
J maintained his reserve at the expense of his line, hoping to plug
holes punched in the latter, with the former. Thus General
Hodges made the breakthrough with only the head of his col
umn, but he was checked by the German second line.

The Allies were stalled all along the line, but the German
resistance tied down large parts of their army. General Eisen
hower realized that if he could make a rapid drive on a new
1 sector, he could perhaps disrupt the whole Nazi equilibrium
and end the action at a blow. He determined to turn the northern
j end of the line and move across the belt of open country behind
the Rhine which ran all the way to Berlin.
General Dempsey now swung north of the Albert Canal, and
parachutists made a brilliant but unsuccessful attempt to master
I the key to the whole situation—the Rhine bridges.
The plan was marred because the weather then went bad,
and the isolated pockets of airborne troops were forced to fight
without reinforcements or relief. General Dempsey gambled
with disaster to race ahead of his supply lines and get to them,
and relieved all but the troops at Arnhem where a British division
was wiped out. The bad weather had allowed the Germans to
reinforce their weak point, which was, undeniably, not quite so
weak as the Allied high command had expected.
Now General Dempsey was strung out in a narrow corridor
i across southwestern Holland, and the Germans had an opening.
They started counterattacking along the whole front, most likely
to cover the shifting of forces to Holland, and General Eisen
i hower tried to create another opening.
He first made a feint by pushing General Patch into the
Vosges for a little ways, and then General Hodges advanced
again. He exploited his breakthrough south of Aachen, and has
accomplished another one to the north of that city. This drive,
which is now going on, will pierce the German center if suc
cessful.
Thus we see General Eisenhower's strategy and Field Mar
shal Von Model's problem. General Eisenhower is trying to
make openings by diverting German attention to the wrong
sector of the front with alternate advances.
Marshal Von Model has the problem of stopping these lunges
successfully and still keeping enough of his reserves intact to
i prevent new Allied openings from developing into German
disasters.
If Von Model can stop General Hodges without using up
every available man in reserve, he might yet be able to take
advantage of General Dempsey's over-extension. Yet General
Eisenhower might, if stopped east of Aachen, suddenly rein
force the British and make another drive—this time overland —
toward the Rhine bridges, anticipating his opponent. Or yet,
he might leave General Dempsey on the defensive, strengthen
ing him and keeping enough in reserve so that a large-scale Ger
man victory in the north would not roll up his entire line, and
strike through Luxembourg toward Coblenz. This blow would
probably shatter German resistance along the Moselle, as Mar
shal Von Model would either have to withdraw the troops before
General Patton all the way back to the Rhine, or else face the
problem of defending the re-entrant angle at the junction of the
Rhine and the Moselle. In short, Von Model has no guarantee
of stopping the drive around Aachen, and, even if he did, he
might need so many men to do it that he would make a disaster
for himself somewhere else.
