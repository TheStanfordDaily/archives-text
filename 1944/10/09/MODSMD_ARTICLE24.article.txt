REG-DAY
Well, students, another quarter is upon us, so grab a bottle
of aspirin, a checkbook, and a well-oiled pen, and prepare to give
everything but your life's blood to dear old Stanford. The only
reason they don't get your blood, is because there is a war on,
and they can't legally compete with the Red Cross.
OH, WHAT THE HELL?
This morning I am going to give a little discourse on Reg-DÂ»y,
you know, the day when you ponder over the question of taking
thirteen or eighteen units, and finally end up by saying, "Oh,
what the hell!, so I'll go an extra quarter." It is also the day the
Ad Building looks like the remains of the earthquake of '06.
Speaking about the Building being , messed up, makes me think
that it is too bad that it does look like that, because for most of
you students, it is the only day of the quarter that you visit the
place. For your information, they do clean it up between Reg-
Days. I know, I dropped in one time.
Ah yes! Dear old Reg-Day, the day you notice all the new
freshmen, wide-eyed and eager, and if you will observe a little
closer, you will notice the upperclassmen' also wide-eyed and
EAGER, but for a much different reason. There is some humor
to all the chaos and confusion of this particular day, and it is
usually in the form of verbal comment. Perhaps you will remem
ber similar comments as these. '.'Why should I lose my place
in line? I only stepped out six hours ago." You are sure to hear
this one, "Be smart and take 101 a, it's a snap two units." Of
course if you have had one of these "snap" courses, you are
inclined to be a little wary of the whole thing. Usually all you
have to do is send in the tops of three Cadillacs, buy the prof,
two-fifths of White Horse, and run all over the state of California,
to barely eke out a "B" in the course.
ERSATZ AND MR. STRAUSS
We all manage to live through each Reg-Day though, and
start to look forward to the next one, i.e. (providing we don't
go minus).
In closing today's session, I just want to say that I'm to be the
new writer of this column for the quarter whether you like it
or not. If you don't like it, or do happen to enjoy reading the
column, and wish to make comments caustic or otherwise, please
let me know. The only reason I took over the job is the humani
tarian aspect involved. I want to make a little humor for you in
the mornings, as you will need it while drinking the Cellar's
ersatz coffee, gazing upon the beaming countenance of the re
nowned Mr. Strauss.
