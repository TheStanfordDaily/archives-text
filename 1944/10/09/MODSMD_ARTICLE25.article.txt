# Author Glimpses Japan-Major Problems in Future

### 
Postwar leadership in Japan is a problefr) for all nations to consider,
according to Professor Paul H. Hyde, author of "Japan's Pacific Mandate,"
and authority on that country.
Japan's unstable setup of a modern economic system based on feudal
social foundations is destined to fall when Allied victory is won in the

â™¦
to about 1920. These statesmen came,
of course, from the ruling classes, but
they had not the military tendencies
of the later rulers, who could not
by any means be called statesmen.
Whether Japan will actually as
sume a new philosophy after the war
no one could possibly foretell, though
it is evident from the Revolutionary
tendencies of the period following
World War I that there are enough
Japanese with new ideas to provide
a group from which leaders could be
picked.
Few "Thinkers"
Unfortunately, these are few in
number. They have not the back
ground of the Chinese, who have
had great thinkers and philosophers
in their nation's history; nor have
they had the experience of the West
ern nations. It is enough, though,
that a start has been made. Japan
has had great statesmen, and if she
, is to have more, she will need the
guidance, experience, and wisdom to

Pacific, and the military dictatorship"*
and the entire military clique will
disappear under Allied occupation,
he stated.
A resume of his lecture follows:
Japan's culture has been copied
largely from Confucian China, and
corrupted to fit the feudal system un
der which power was the only re
quirement of the ruling class. The
Chinese culture afforded high posi
tions in society and government to
the educaled, regardless of class.
Japan Rejects Democracy
Japan's highly industrialized eco
nomic system was taken from the
Western civilization, though few of
her people absorbed any of its lib
eral or democratic ideas. Those who
did gained some control around 1918,
but were either ousted or made sub
servient by the incoming military
dictatorship after the Manchurian
invasion of 1931. In philosophy, they
were the liberal descendants of the
Genro-Ito, Yamagata, Oyama, and
Inouye, who ruled Japan from 1889

he offered by (he United Nations.
II is, of course, difficult to con
quer the fanatic young people who
have been born and trained under
the military influence. It will be
with them that we have the great
est trouble. Their own countrymen, '
the liberals, must win them over to j
the side of liberalism and possibly
democracy.
Formula for Peace
Thus, with the facts of Japan's past
and the possibilities of her future in
mind, the powers at the peace table j
can mold a new Japan and remove
the old nation that has been in the
past an everpresent threat of war.
