# Throat-dancer Cured By Stanford Doctor

### 
The case of a patient who lias recovered from the rare condition of cancer
developing on the windpipe is reviewed in an article by Dr. Philip H. Pier
son, clinical professor in the Stanford School of Medicine, in the Sept. 211
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.
The patient was a (il-year-old man who'did a great deal of lecturing.

Bouts of hard coughing with some ♦
spitting of blood, extreme fatigue,
I and loss of weight were the chief
■ symptoms for almost three years. t
I Finally, the patient consulted a j
I physician for the first time when he
• began to suffer periods of intense
| suffocation and when his voice was |
reduced to a whisper.
Dr. Pierson removed as much of
' the cancer as possible by an opera
tion through a bronchoscope, a self- j
illuminated tube which is passed
down the patient's throat. By means
!of this tube, the doctor can see
whether there are any foreign sub
j stances In the throat.
Through Windpipe
The radium was inserted in the
; windpipe through the bronchoscope, |
; using a special radium holder de- |
vised by Dr. Robert E. Newell of the
Stanford Medical School's depart
ment of roentgenology. At the first j
attempt to insert this, the applicator
! was broken. The second time, the j
patient coughed il out after three
! and one-half hoyrs. Then another j
applicator was broken. Finally, [
everything went well and the ra- |
j diuin was kept in the windpipe for
| five hours as planned.
The patient is now alive and well |
! two years after treatment, walks !
considerable distances, lectures with
out coughing or shortness of breath,
and has regained the lost weight.
| Scientists Interested
Of special interest to scientists is 1
the fact that the patient was given I
a drink of radioactive iodine to de- j
j tcrmine whether or not the cancer I
; had arisen from thyroid gland tissue ;
! that might have been misplaced dur
ing embryonic development. Nor
mal thyroid tissue collects radioac- :
live iodine, just as it does ordinary 1
iodine for manufacture of the hor- j
mone, thyroxin. No radioactivity,
however, could be found in the
pieces of cancer removed by bron- |
i choscope, which ruled out the pres
[ ence of normal thyroid gland.

vised by Dr. Robert E. Newell of the
Stanford Medical School's depart
ment of roentgenology. At the first j
attempt to insert this, the applicator
! was broken. The second time, the j
patient coughed il out after three
! and one-half hoyrs. Then another j
applicator was broken. Finally, [
everything went well and the ra- |
j diuin was kept in the windpipe for
| five hours as planned.
The patient is now alive and well |
! two years after treatment, walks !
considerable distances, lectures with
out coughing or shortness of breath,
and has regained the lost weight.

Of special interest to scientists is 1
the fact that the patient was given I
a drink of radioactive iodine to de- j
j tcrmine whether or not the cancer I
; had arisen from thyroid gland tissue ;
! that might have been misplaced dur
ing embryonic development. Nor
mal thyroid tissue collects radioac- :
live iodine, just as it does ordinary 1
iodine for manufacture of the hor- j
mone, thyroxin. No radioactivity,
however, could be found in the
pieces of cancer removed by bron- |
i choscope, which ruled out the pres
[ ence of normal thyroid gland.
The case of a patient who lias recovered from the rare condition of cancer
developing on the windpipe is reviewed in an article by Dr. Philip H. Pier
son, clinical professor in the Stanford School of Medicine, in the Sept. 211
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.
The patient was a (il-year-old man who'did a great deal of lecturing.

Bouts of hard coughing with some ♦
spitting of blood, extreme fatigue,
I and loss of weight were the chief
■ symptoms for almost three years. t
I Finally, the patient consulted a j
I physician for the first time when he
• began to suffer periods of intense
| suffocation and when his voice was |
reduced to a whisper.
Dr. Pierson removed as much of
' the cancer as possible by an opera
tion through a bronchoscope, a self- j
illuminated tube which is passed
down the patient's throat. By means
!of this tube, the doctor can see
whether there are any foreign sub
j stances In the throat.
