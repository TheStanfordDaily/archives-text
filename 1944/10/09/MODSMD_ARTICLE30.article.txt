It has been a little over fifteen
years now since Sideline Slants made
its first appearance in the Daily, fif
teen years of championship teams
and all-Americans.
About that time Stanford was com
ing into its own as a great school for
championship teams. It was during
. the hey-day of "Pop" Warner, dur
ing the siring of victories over Cali
fornia in football and track that
Slants first saw the light of day. Bon
Eastman was still in high school at
the time as were the vow boys. Dink
Templeton and Bill Ellington's great
track teams of the late '.'JO's were still
in grammar school. Shaughnessy's
great rags-to-riches Rose Bowl team
of 11)40 was only eight or nine years
old. "Hank" Luisetti was practicing
on sand lots at the lime. Yes, the
golden age of Stanford sports was
just over the horizon in 1929.
Is the golden age over? Has Stan
ford seen the last of great times?
Will we ever again beat Cal in foot
ball or Southern Cal in track or ever
again produce the greatest basket
ball team on the coast? Now that we

have reached the top. are we now on
the downgrade? We have no foot
ball team. We have no basketball
team. We have no track or base
ball team. We haven't beaten Cal
at track since 1940. In 1941, we didn't
even win one first place out of 15
events. Our outstanding basketball
players—Pollard, Dallmar, and the
others—are off to the wars and may
not return to the Farm. Any football
players we may have had recently
have gone elsewhere. They may not
return. If they do come back after
the war, they will undoubtedly come
back in a more serious frame of
mind, a mind geared to studies and
not to football.
When the war came, all the col
leges endeavored to do their bit for
the effort by training men for the
great conflict. Some colleges re
ceived Navy men. Some received
Marines. Stanford was of those that
received soldiers. It so happened
that the Navy and the Marines were
allowed to participate in inter-col
legiate sports; while the War De
apartment refused to grant permission
™ for Army students to take part.
Therefore, the Farm was more or
less left out in the cold. That left
quite a decision up to the Board of
Trustees. There was lots of pressure
on both sides. Should Stanford com
pute in inter-collegiate sports or not?
Well, let s look at the problems they
had to face before they could answer.
The other teams will all be using
experienced men. Stanford would
have to use a team made up of most
ly 17-year-olds. Would that be
right? Wouldn't it be nothing short
of massacre? If we did have teams,
and they undoubtedly would be los
ing teams, would not the fans and
the students and the alumni demand
a change in coaches? II would not
hie the coaches' fault if the teams

: wee rpoor, for not even the best of
j coaches can produce with poor ma
\ terial. Just think of all the out
standing coaches we would lose. One
of the great basketball mentors of all
time is on the Farm in the name of
Everett Dean. We would also lose
Marchy Schwartz, one ot the best
football coaches on the coast, and
Pitch Johnson, our track coach. By
discontinuing sports, we were able to
keep this great coaching staff. Other
wise we might have lost these men.
Then we come to the issue oi ex
pense. Usually football pays for all
the other sports. When we don't have
a good team, we lose money. That
may not mean much to you, but to
i

the Board of Trustees, it means quite
a bit. Perhaps that was the big rea
son for discontinuing sports here on
the Farm. The fact remains, how
ever, that for those reasons elabo
rated on and for many others, we
have no athletics today. I person
ally believe it is for the best. At
least we have some consolation—the
Axe is resting securely in the Cellar.
The outlook for returning to that
golden age of sports at Stanford
looks pretty dismal, doesn't it? We
built from scratch before and pro
duced truly great teams, and, not
only can we, but we will produce
great teams again, teams just as great
as the Big Red Machine of Frankie
Albert & Co.. as the N.C.A.A. bas
ketball champs of a few years back,
as the N.C.A.A. track champs in the
late '30's. as our national champion
ship tennis and golf teams. Never
believe the adage "they don't come
back," for the glory that once was
Stanford's will return just as sure as
the world is round.
