# Cards Lead in Series, 3-2
## 
### 
Home runs bv Ray Sanders and Danny Litwiler gave the Cardinals a
2-to-0 decision over the Browns and a three games to two lead in the fifth
world series game played before an overflow crovtfd of 36,56? yesterday.
Mort Cooper, after losing the opener to Denny Galehouse, bounced back
to earn the decision over the veteran righthander with a seven-hit per
formance, striking out 12 men, only one short of the all-time world series
record established by Howard Ehmke for the Philadelphia Athletics against
Chicago in 1929.
CARDS OUTIHT
Galehouse virtually matched Cooper hit for hit except for the two home
runs which meant the game. The Brownies outhit the Cards, seven to six,
but Cooper was flawless with men on base. Galehouse whiffed 10 men and
allowed only two walks.
Danny Litwiler opened the game with a double to left center, but died at
that spot as Galehouse fanned the side. Whitey Kuroski and Emil Verban
scratched infield singles in the second and Stan Musial bounced a double
over outfielder Gene Moore's head in the third. But again the veteran right
hander staved out of serious trouble with his strikeout pitching.
0-0 DEADLOCK IN THIRD
Don Gutteridge walked in the Brownie first and Vern Stephens cracked
a sharp single past Marty Marion, but both were left on base. The Brownies
didn't connect again until the third when Mike Kreevich's hit into left took
a bad bounce past Litwiler for a double. But Gene Moore was a strike-out
victim to continue the 0-0 deadlock.
Galehous? put the Cards down in order in the fourth and Verban was the
only Card base runner until the sixth when Ray Sanders homered with
two gone.
HAYWORTH LINES SINGLE..
The first Brownie to reach third after Kreevieh doubled in the third was
Red Hayworth, who lined a single to right in the fifth and advanced on an
outfield error. Cooper pulled out of that by retiring the next two men.
He displayed real fast ball pitching in the sixth after the Brown's loaded
the sacks with one out on singles by Kreevieh and Stephens and a walk to
McQuinn. Cooper struck out A 1 Zarilla and Mark Christman in order to
stop the Brown cause cold.
Litwiler's circuit clout occurred in the eighth .with none down.
ATTENDANCE ZOOMS
The official attendance was 3G,5(i8 and the gross receipts $157,019, both
the highest of the series.
The sixth game of the series will be played today with the probable pit
chers being Lel'ty Max Lanier for the Cards and Nelson Potter for the
Brownies. A decision for the Cards today would terminate the 1944 edition
of the World Series.
A new record was added to the books today when Mort Cooper and
Danny Galehouse combined to strike out 22 men in this, the fifth game,
and thus break the record of 21 made in two previous series. In order to
achieve this, Cooper had to strike out the three men to face him in the last
of the ninth, and this he did to prove to one and all that he is truly one of
the great right handers in the game today. His feat will go down alongside
the many other great feats of world series pitchers. Galehouse struck out
ten to Cooper's 12.

Danny Galehouse combined to strike out 22 men in this, the fifth game,
and thus break the record of 21 made in two previous series. In order to
achieve this, Cooper had to strike out the three men to face him in the last
of the ninth, and this he did to prove to one and all that he is truly one of
the great right handers in the game today. His feat will go down alongside
the many other great feats of world series pitchers. Galehouse struck out
ten to Cooper's 12.
Home runs bv Ray Sanders and Danny Litwiler gave the Cardinals a
2-to-0 decision over the Browns and a three games to two lead in the fifth
world series game played before an overflow crovtfd of 36,56? yesterday.
Mort Cooper, after losing the opener to Denny Galehouse, bounced back
to earn the decision over the veteran righthander with a seven-hit per
formance, striking out 12 men, only one short of the all-time world series
record established by Howard Ehmke for the Philadelphia Athletics against
Chicago in 1929.
CARDS OUTIHT
Galehouse virtually matched Cooper hit for hit except for the two home
runs which meant the game. The Brownies outhit the Cards, seven to six,
but Cooper was flawless with men on base. Galehouse whiffed 10 men and
allowed only two walks.
Danny Litwiler opened the game with a double to left center, but died at
that spot as Galehouse fanned the side. Whitey Kuroski and Emil Verban
scratched infield singles in the second and Stan Musial bounced a double
over outfielder Gene Moore's head in the third. But again the veteran right
hander staved out of serious trouble with his strikeout pitching.
0-0 DEADLOCK IN THIRD
Don Gutteridge walked in the Brownie first and Vern Stephens cracked
a sharp single past Marty Marion, but both were left on base. The Brownies
didn't connect again until the third when Mike Kreevich's hit into left took
a bad bounce past Litwiler for a double. But Gene Moore was a strike-out
victim to continue the 0-0 deadlock.
Galehous? put the Cards down in order in the fourth and Verban was the
only Card base runner until the sixth when Ray Sanders homered with
two gone.
HAYWORTH LINES SINGLE..
The first Brownie to reach third after Kreevieh doubled in the third was
Red Hayworth, who lined a single to right in the fifth and advanced on an
outfield error. Cooper pulled out of that by retiring the next two men.
He displayed real fast ball pitching in the sixth after the Brown's loaded
the sacks with one out on singles by Kreevieh and Stephens and a walk to
McQuinn. Cooper struck out A 1 Zarilla and Mark Christman in order to
stop the Brown cause cold.
Litwiler's circuit clout occurred in the eighth .with none down.
ATTENDANCE ZOOMS
The official attendance was 3G,5(i8 and the gross receipts $157,019, both
the highest of the series.
The sixth game of the series will be played today with the probable pit
chers being Lel'ty Max Lanier for the Cards and Nelson Potter for the
Brownies. A decision for the Cards today would terminate the 1944 edition
of the World Series.
