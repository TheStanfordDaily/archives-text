under the direction of Harry Wolter.
As yet no announcement has been
made concerning the arrangement of
schedules, time, and place of games,
etc., but it is probable that more or
less the same conditions as last year
will apply.
Intramural football is a six-man,
touch-tackle game. Contests are
played crosswise on regulation foot
ball fields, about sixty yards from
goal to goal. There are no gained
first downs, it being necessary to
score in four downs or lose the ball.
Time of games is usually forty min- ,
.utes, with teams changing ends at
the end (if every quarter. Rules
concerning tagging, etc., are left up
to the teams themselves. Referees

for the contests must be provided by
the teams competing.
Games will undoubtedly be played
on the three practice fields, the
sunken diamond, and in the stadium.
There will be three crosswise fields
on each of the regulation football
fields, with sideline and endlines be
ing marked in the sunken diamond.
Games will probably be played in
the afternoon.
Volleyball games will be played on
regulation courts in the Pavilion and
Encina Gym, probably at night. All
regulation rules will apply. As in the
j case of football, participating teams
I will probably be required to provide
referees.
