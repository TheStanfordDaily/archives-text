# Return of the Veterans: How Hot a Potato?
## 
### 
Returning to civilian and University life today after service
in the armed forces of the United States are over 75 veterans,
who will register as undergraduate, special, and graduate stu
dents at Stanford. For some, Stanford is home; the other men
are new to us.
This is the first large group of veterans to come to Stanford—
previous guarters have seen a few, but never enough to present
a problem which one of the veterans himself has called a "hot
potato."
True enough, at other universities with a large registration
of veterans the problem of readjustment has been a "hot potato"
for university administration, the veterans themselves, and for
fellow civilian students. Charges and complaints of all kinds
have been hurled in every direction by everyone, including the
usual demagogues.
Stanford students- returning veterans, civilian students, and
the Daily—wonder, however, just how "hot" this potato will be
come. For that reason, this editorial throws open the entire gues
tion to the student body. To the veterans, to the students, to
faculty and administration, through the medium of Campus
Opinion, the Daily extends an invitation to discuss the problems
of returning veterans. Such a discussion is healthy and would
be typical of the Stanford way of student community life.
By way of background, Executive Committee, at the end of
summer guarter, established a committee to study the advisa
bility of an organization on campus designed for veteran mem
bers only.
The Daily guestions the advisability of an organization which
would separate veterans frcm the other students. Stanford is an
example of community life, of community endeavor, and a com
munity sharing of common problems. We are a homogeneous
group of students. We go to class together, we eat together, we
try to solve problems together.
At other universities veterans' organizations have not served
in the best interests of the veterans. They have split campus
interests, they have attracted undesirable political elements, and
have further emphasized the difference between men who have
experienced war and civilians who have not.
No one, admittedly, can speak of war who has not been
through it. But many a veteran, interviewed, has stated that the
only way he has been able to adjust to civilian life has been to
plunge into it, to join in as many civilian activities as possible.
Well, the discussion is now open, and veterans and civilians
alike can be assured that the Daily will not fail to present every
side of the issue, and to explain every situation as it occurs.

through it. But many a veteran, interviewed, has stated that the
only way he has been able to adjust to civilian life has been to
plunge into it, to join in as many civilian activities as possible.
Well, the discussion is now open, and veterans and civilians
alike can be assured that the Daily will not fail to present every
side of the issue, and to explain every situation as it occurs.
Returning to civilian and University life today after service
in the armed forces of the United States are over 75 veterans,
who will register as undergraduate, special, and graduate stu
dents at Stanford. For some, Stanford is home; the other men
are new to us.
This is the first large group of veterans to come to Stanford—
previous guarters have seen a few, but never enough to present
a problem which one of the veterans himself has called a "hot
potato."
True enough, at other universities with a large registration
of veterans the problem of readjustment has been a "hot potato"
for university administration, the veterans themselves, and for
fellow civilian students. Charges and complaints of all kinds
have been hurled in every direction by everyone, including the
usual demagogues.
Stanford students- returning veterans, civilian students, and
the Daily—wonder, however, just how "hot" this potato will be
come. For that reason, this editorial throws open the entire gues
tion to the student body. To the veterans, to the students, to
faculty and administration, through the medium of Campus
Opinion, the Daily extends an invitation to discuss the problems
of returning veterans. Such a discussion is healthy and would
be typical of the Stanford way of student community life.
By way of background, Executive Committee, at the end of
summer guarter, established a committee to study the advisa
bility of an organization on campus designed for veteran mem
bers only.
The Daily guestions the advisability of an organization which
would separate veterans frcm the other students. Stanford is an
example of community life, of community endeavor, and a com
munity sharing of common problems. We are a homogeneous
group of students. We go to class together, we eat together, we
try to solve problems together.
At other universities veterans' organizations have not served
in the best interests of the veterans. They have split campus
interests, they have attracted undesirable political elements, and
have further emphasized the difference between men who have
experienced war and civilians who have not.
No one, admittedly, can speak of war who has not been
through it. But many a veteran, interviewed, has stated that the
only way he has been able to adjust to civilian life has been to
plunge into it, to join in as many civilian activities as possible.
