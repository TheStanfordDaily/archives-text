dent body government activities autumn quarter, last night said:
"Our student government at Stanford is founded upon the- same prin
ciples as our national government: principles of popular vote, representa
tion, and equality of rights among citizens.
"A democracy, a government of the people and for the people is no better
than disorganization if it is not backed by the people, if it docs not have
the serious thought and sincere interest of the people behind it.
"We at Stanford are fortunate to have this opportunity of student gov
ernment, but we need the students behind it.
"The Executive Committee wants the opinions and arguments of the
whole student body, either through the Daily or directly in Excom meet
ings which will be announced in the Daily. In the election we need every
one's vote to tell us how a policy or amendment should be handled.
"We have a democracy here, and it is the responsibility of every indi
vidual student to keep it strong, effective, and, above all, truly democratic.
