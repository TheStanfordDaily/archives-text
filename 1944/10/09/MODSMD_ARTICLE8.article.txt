events of mi; week
Monday, October !)
Eiyht to 5:00 p.m. will embrace
Lh.it space of time commonly re
ferred to .is General Registration
Day. No doubt the Registrar will be
doing quite a rushed business, so if
you find standing in line a little ar
| duous, we'd advise you to be there
I bright and early.
Compared to the hustle and bustle
of "Reg Day," Tuesday will be com
paratively quiet. A motion picture,
| "A Nous la Liberte," will be shown
in the evening in the auditorium of
j Memorial Hall. It begins promptly
! at 7:30 and the public is invited.
Since no events have been schcd
uled for Wednesday or Thursday,
| those days are evidently to be de
! voted to getting settled in classes,
; so you can "buckle down" to study
ing. On Friday, however, at 11:00
I a.m., there will be a University As-
I sembly in the Auditorium of Me
! morial Hall, where the students will
! be addressed by the head of the
i University, President Donald D.
| Tresiddcr.
Saturday, October 11
This can be given over mainly to
j relaxation and enjoyment, not to
| mention the little matter of a class
| in English A for the "freshmen" ....
| if you happened not to pass that
: English Matriculation Exam!

with the Stanford Museum of Fine j
