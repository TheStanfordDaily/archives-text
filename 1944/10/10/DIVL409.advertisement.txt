Don't Set the calendar
fool you...CHRISTMAS
HL '■<»#•
For the men and women overseas it's Christmas many shop
ping clays ahead of time. Last year many servicemen and
women overseas did not receive their Christmas packages until
January and February. Some packages did not get there at
all due to careless addressing, and flimsy insecure packing.
Make sure that this doesn't happen this year by shopping
early, by packing correctly and securely, and by writing ad
dresses carefully.
Roos Bros will help you with any problems that you may
have. Just drop down to your nearest Roos Bros store, and
let them help you with the selection of your gift. Roos Bros
will also package your purchases according to the regulations
specified by the Post Office Department. And they will pay
postage on gifts purchased at the store and addressed to any
point within the United States.
GET IT "OVER THERE" ON TIME !
