# Search for Queens Begins
## 
### 
In a University flush with femininity and pulchritude, the Stanford Quad today fired its open
ing gun in a year-long search for campus queens who will ultimately occupy several full pages
in the yearbook.
The announcement of the proposed plan was made jointly by Quad Business Manager Nancy
Gilmer and Editor Hayes Hunter.
Said Hunter: <
"In a University the size of Stanford it is always desirable to pick leading feminine person
alities and feature them in such a section as the Queen section of the Quad. It will be something
to remember in years to come, not only for the girls who finally will appear in the section, but
for their friends.
Miss Gilmer added:
"Not only will Stanford feminine beauty be represented, but also proposed plans call for full
color reproduction of some of the scenic beauty of Stanford.
"The Quad stands on the threshold of a new era and necessarily must incorporate new ideas
to cope with coming events."
Hunter further stated that the Queens will be chosen by a five-man committee composed of
the editors of the three campus publications, plus A.S.S.U. President Barbara White and a float
ing vote.
The floating vote will consist of people from different groups from time to time.
Several contests will be sponsored during autumn and winter quarters, with Hans Roth, local
studio photographer, taking the contest photographs .
