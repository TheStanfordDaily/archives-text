# Farm President Emphasizes Change In ASSU Activities

### 
Barbara White, ASSU president, wishes to welcome all new students to
Stanford, and has written the following message:
"Fall quarter is here again and as usual we've made those resolutions
about- really hitting the books and getting down to work.
"We've returned to find that again Stanford has changed outwardly as
it has each year. The Greek letters are gone; there are women in Bran
ner and in some of the fraternity houses. In addition, at least 70% of us
are under 21 years of age.
"The pre-war Stanford is gone entirely but we're gradually emerging
into a post-war Stanford. Some of the older Stanford men. war veterans
now. arc back to take the places waiting for themâ€”and we're glad to see
them.
"The Associated Students v/ill face the situation squarely and plan and
work accordingly. Excom is looking forward to this year and intends to
plan a full and well-balanced program.
"As your representatives, the members of Excom will be adopting new
policies and one of our first will be the social policy. Last year, one was
formulated but now has been found inadequate. The issue must be met
again and we intend to meet it.
"We're glad to be back and anxious to start. With the administration and
the Associated Students working together, we can't lose. It's still Stanford
and a new year, so let's go to make it our best."
