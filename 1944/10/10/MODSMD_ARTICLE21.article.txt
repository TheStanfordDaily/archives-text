# Course On Far Eastern Affairs Offered Civilians
## 
### 
During the last half-ecntury the Far East has assumed increasingly
greater importance in world affairs, yet few people have been aware of
this quite apparent fact. It took a war to show us that the Orient is also
our concern. To help our armed forces fighting in the Pacific, special
courses in Far Eastern affairs were offered to army students by Stanford's
School of Humanities.
Today it is recognizee! that the Army alone should not be interested in

I thcFar East, but that every Amcri-'
can citizen should know something
about that, mysterious and confusing
area in order to have a clear and
undistortcd picture of where we arc
heading.
Taking cognizance of this situation,
the School of Humanities is offering
a course in Far Eastern Affairs to
civilians for the first time. Its or
ganization will be based mainly on
the experience gained in conducting
the ASTP classes on the subject, but
the civilian courses will put more
j stress on things cultural, an aspcct
neglected in the Army courses.
The coursc of study is intended to
liive the student an insight into the
geographic, racial, historical, politi
cal, and cultural programs of the re
gion. Special attention will be given
to China, Japan. Southeast Asia, and
the Pacific Islands, but time will also
be given to India, and it is planned
to extend the course later to cover
Russia, which is becoming a domi
nant factor in Far Eastern Affairs.
The co,urse, open to all students of
the University except freshmen, is
planned as an introduction to the
Far East, and more detailed courses
of study will be offered later as a
continuation of the work. It will be
offered as a five unit course and will
consist of two quarters, but it may |
also be taken for one quarter only.
It is listed under Humanities 91 in
the Time Schedule and will be given
at 8:00 o'clock in the morning. The j
course of study will be conducted by '

Professors Arthur E. Bestor, Jr.
Shau Wing Chan, Felix Kcesint.
John W. Masland, Frederic Spiegel
berg, and C. Langdon White, and wil
be under the general direction ol
Professor A. E. Sokol.

the University except freshmen, is
planned as an introduction to the
Far East, and more detailed courses
of study will be offered later as a
continuation of the work. It will be
offered as a five unit course and will
consist of two quarters, but it may |
also be taken for one quarter only.
It is listed under Humanities 91 in
the Time Schedule and will be given
at 8:00 o'clock in the morning. The j
course of study will be conducted by '

Professors Arthur E. Bestor, Jr.
Shau Wing Chan, Felix Kcesint.
John W. Masland, Frederic Spiegel
berg, and C. Langdon White, and wil
be under the general direction ol
Professor A. E. Sokol.
During the last half-ecntury the Far East has assumed increasingly
greater importance in world affairs, yet few people have been aware of
this quite apparent fact. It took a war to show us that the Orient is also
our concern. To help our armed forces fighting in the Pacific, special
courses in Far Eastern affairs were offered to army students by Stanford's
School of Humanities.
Today it is recognizee! that the Army alone should not be interested in

I thcFar East, but that every Amcri-'
can citizen should know something
about that, mysterious and confusing
area in order to have a clear and
undistortcd picture of where we arc
heading.
Taking cognizance of this situation,
the School of Humanities is offering
a course in Far Eastern Affairs to
civilians for the first time. Its or
ganization will be based mainly on
the experience gained in conducting
the ASTP classes on the subject, but
the civilian courses will put more
j stress on things cultural, an aspcct
neglected in the Army courses.
The coursc of study is intended to
liive the student an insight into the
geographic, racial, historical, politi
cal, and cultural programs of the re
gion. Special attention will be given
to China, Japan. Southeast Asia, and
the Pacific Islands, but time will also
be given to India, and it is planned
to extend the course later to cover
Russia, which is becoming a domi
nant factor in Far Eastern Affairs.
