# MORE SOCIAL POLICY
## 
### 
Although the present student administration undoubtedly
realizes that the social policy wrung out alter months of argu
ment by the last administration does not adequately cover the
situation, it would be well for discussion to start again on the
subject.
Defeatists who claim that arguments gain nothing are incor
rect. No major piece of legislation, and social policy is a major
piece of lawmaking for Excom, can be accomplished in a short
time.
With a large freshman class it is especially desirable that new
students become acquainted with the meaning of the Funda
mental Standard,an d its relation to drinking; and with University
I olicy in relation to social regulations.
No inference of moral judgment is made by social regulation,
but just what is meant should be made clear.
