# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
1 he first thing I want to clear up in today's column, is the
fact that I did not write this daily epistle last quarter, and that my
name is not George Crane. If any of you are in doubt, just com
pare the two columns, and you will notice that he is well versed
in the art of writing, whereas my work is merely throwing the
old malarkey." In fact, another name for this daily article could
be Comedy of Errors." I hope now, that any ambiguity that
has arisen over said topic has finally been cleared.
The main topic of the Bull Session for today will be —that's
right, I knew you had guessed it—SEX! However don't hold
your breath, because I'm going to put it on an aesthetic plane.
In other words, you won't find any crude vulgar stuff such as
would be overheard in girl's dorms, but merely a few of my own
observations on the ratio of women to men on the campus this
quarter.
Women! women! women! there are more gals around here
than Carter has Liver Pills. Fellow male students, the situation
around here is getting to be drastic, but I have sincere faith in
the ability of you "wolves" to be able to cope with this horrible
thing. When women whistle at you, don't be amazed and non
plused, merely walk up to them, get their name and telephone
number, and if you find time, for God's sake take them out some
night. No male student on this campus has the right to be with
out a couple of gals on the string, and not to be dating at all is
more or less being a traitor to your alma mater. If you don't
date, you will be undermining the morale on the home front.
All this stuff about the ratio was supposed to be something
of a satire, but I really meant to strike a serious note in the
things I said about dating. Just think fellows, it would be a
deplorable situation to have a campus full of frustrated women.
It might get to the point where a man would have to carry a
gun, and this would be very serious, as firearms are rather scarce
these days. For years, the Stanford campus has been a place
where you had to date a gal six months in advance, and then
she might tell you to try to find someone else at the last mo
ment. Things are just reversed now, so this is the time to get in
on the ground floor. Be sure and take advantage of it fellows,
this marvelous phenomenon can't last forever.
In closing, I just wish to say, if there are any riots, strikes, or
any fellows in the hospital as a result of being attacked, don't
say I didn't warn you.

night. No male student on this campus has the right to be with
out a couple of gals on the string, and not to be dating at all is
more or less being a traitor to your alma mater. If you don't
date, you will be undermining the morale on the home front.
All this stuff about the ratio was supposed to be something
of a satire, but I really meant to strike a serious note in the
things I said about dating. Just think fellows, it would be a
deplorable situation to have a campus full of frustrated women.
It might get to the point where a man would have to carry a
gun, and this would be very serious, as firearms are rather scarce
these days. For years, the Stanford campus has been a place
where you had to date a gal six months in advance, and then
she might tell you to try to find someone else at the last mo
ment. Things are just reversed now, so this is the time to get in
on the ground floor. Be sure and take advantage of it fellows,
this marvelous phenomenon can't last forever.
In closing, I just wish to say, if there are any riots, strikes, or
any fellows in the hospital as a result of being attacked, don't
say I didn't warn you.
1 he first thing I want to clear up in today's column, is the
fact that I did not write this daily epistle last quarter, and that my
name is not George Crane. If any of you are in doubt, just com
pare the two columns, and you will notice that he is well versed
in the art of writing, whereas my work is merely throwing the
old malarkey." In fact, another name for this daily article could
be Comedy of Errors." I hope now, that any ambiguity that
has arisen over said topic has finally been cleared.
The main topic of the Bull Session for today will be —that's
right, I knew you had guessed it—SEX! However don't hold
your breath, because I'm going to put it on an aesthetic plane.
In other words, you won't find any crude vulgar stuff such as
would be overheard in girl's dorms, but merely a few of my own
observations on the ratio of women to men on the campus this
quarter.
Women! women! women! there are more gals around here
than Carter has Liver Pills. Fellow male students, the situation
around here is getting to be drastic, but I have sincere faith in
the ability of you "wolves" to be able to cope with this horrible
thing. When women whistle at you, don't be amazed and non
plused, merely walk up to them, get their name and telephone
number, and if you find time, for God's sake take them out some
night. No male student on this campus has the right to be with
