# WAR FRONTS
## 
### Elliot Epsteen 
Perhaps the most regretable features of the present news is the relative
quiet along the line of the Vistula. It represents a fact which probably has
allowed the Germans to prolong the war unnecessarily. It is, namely, that,
while each of the two separate major fronts has been active, the other has
been either consolidating or else outright blocked. This has allowed the
Germans to operate on interior lines ♦

j and thus double the effectiveness of
their manpower. While the former
lack of co-ordination could be
blamed, to some extent, on the great
evil of coalition warfare and the lack
of a supreme, overall commander, the
present seems to be due to some
strategically questionable Russian
operations.
In order to understand why these
! moves on the chessboard of the East
! ern Front are open to somewhat
critical review, it is necessary to un
{ derstand the military concept of the
j decisive point. On every battle line
| there is one sector where a break
j through will utterly shatter the ene
my's equilibrium and defeat him as
| thoroughly and as cheaply as pos
j sible. It might be in the center, as
at Austerlitz, or on one of the wings,
! as at the Mareth Line. It is thus the
| duty of the commander to select the
J point of decision and concentrate as
j much as he can there.
Look at Map
; A good map of the present theater
of the Russian war giving a relative
j ly decent idea of the features of the
| terrain, should show where this point
is located. It is along the winding
; and fast-flowing' Vistula. *fhe rea-
J .sons why are that a Russian break
| through here would push the whole
German line back to the Oder itself,
j and offer a chance to invade indus
j trial Silesia and to mass a blow to
J strike toward central Germany it
■ self. The complete defeat of the Nazis
will come only in Germany, where
the mechanized heart of Hitler's war
machine is, and not in Bulgaria,
J Greece, or Lithuania.
Yet the Russians have been strik
j ing out towards the flanks and leav
ing the Vistula line untouched. The
first of the operations termed ques
tionable, then, is the present Rus
sian scenic tour through the Balkans,
i It can be said that this will eventu
ally poise a threat to Germany by
way of the Danube Valley, but,
again, a look at a map will show that
this threat would be long in develop
ing. For the present, the Germans
can ignore it, since it would not be
critical until Allied columns reached
1 the Austrian border. There, the
j Germans could attempt to establish
j a good and narrow line of defense,
j Meanwhile, they are at liberty to
concentrate their attention in the
West. If they were faced with the
problem of simultaneously defend
ing the West Wall and the Oder,
ihey probably wouldn't have dared
to shift reserves temporarily to the
I former, and the Arnheim pocket
might now be recorded as a brilliant
Allied victory.
Lithuanian Drive
The second operation is the drive
! into Lithuania. This bulge in the
' Russian flanks would hardly make a
j good base for a German counter
, offensive as il is effectively cut off
; from anything but a small stream
of supplies. Yet the Russians have
j diverted large resources of man
power and materiel into a major
offensive to wipe out this pocket,
when they could have much more
j simply contained it.
Meanwhile the Vistula line is si
lent, too much being diverted to the
Balkans and Baltics for an offen
| sive here. The Russians had a chance
i for four simultaneous drives in the
j form of concentric pincers that could
have quickly and efficiently defeated
the Germans. The first, or northern
most arm, was between East Prussia
and Warsaw, and the second, or

southernmost one, was the long
wedge which Marshal Konev was
thrusting towards Krakow. These
two could have tried 1o push to
gether and form a gigantic ring
around the whole German line. The
second two were aimed at both sides
of Warsaw. A simultaneous offen
sive by all four would have forced
the Germans to yank reserves away
from the Polish capital to protect
themselves from encirclement and
thus lose the place, being forced into
a hasty retreat toward the Oder or
else a battle against superior num
bers in open ground whose issue
would he decided in the beginning.
Sorry Record
But these arms have had a sorry
record. The first made a short thrust
that put it across the Narew, and
then settled down to enjoy the coun
tryside. The second at one time
fired a few guns to let the world
know it was still in existence, a
thousand to be exact. The two
around Warsaw lost a valuable and
excellently placed ally in the form
of General Bor.
At last, however, there are reports
of a Russian lunge through the
tangled mass of the East Prussian
forests, which may .signal the open
ing of the awaited offensive along
the Vistula. This, coupled with our
Aachen drive, might succeed in giv
ing the wanting effect of simultane
ousness necessary to bring the war
to an early end.

j much as he can there.
Look at Map
; A good map of the present theater
of the Russian war giving a relative
j ly decent idea of the features of the

is located. It is along the winding
; and fast-flowing' Vistula. *fhe rea-
J .sons why are that a Russian break

German line back to the Oder itself,

■ self. The complete defeat of the Nazis
will come only in Germany, where
the mechanized heart of Hitler's war
machine is, and not in Bulgaria,
J Greece, or Lithuania.
Yet the Russians have been strik
j ing out towards the flanks and leav
ing the Vistula line untouched. The
first of the operations termed ques
tionable, then, is the present Rus
sian scenic tour through the Balkans,
i It can be said that this will eventu
ally poise a threat to Germany by
way of the Danube Valley, but,
again, a look at a map will show that
this threat would be long in develop
ing. For the present, the Germans
can ignore it, since it would not be
critical until Allied columns reached
1 the Austrian border. There, the
j Germans could attempt to establish
j a good and narrow line of defense,
j Meanwhile, they are at liberty to
concentrate their attention in the
West. If they were faced with the
problem of simultaneously defend
ing the West Wall and the Oder,
ihey probably wouldn't have dared
to shift reserves temporarily to the
I former, and the Arnheim pocket
might now be recorded as a brilliant
Allied victory.
Lithuanian Drive
The second operation is the drive
! into Lithuania. This bulge in the
' Russian flanks would hardly make a
j good base for a German counter
, offensive as il is effectively cut off
; from anything but a small stream
of supplies. Yet the Russians have
j diverted large resources of man
power and materiel into a major
offensive to wipe out this pocket,
when they could have much more
j simply contained it.
Meanwhile the Vistula line is si
lent, too much being diverted to the
Balkans and Baltics for an offen
| sive here. The Russians had a chance
i for four simultaneous drives in the
j form of concentric pincers that could
have quickly and efficiently defeated
the Germans. The first, or northern
most arm, was between East Prussia
and Warsaw, and the second, or

southernmost one, was the long
wedge which Marshal Konev was
thrusting towards Krakow. These
two could have tried 1o push to
gether and form a gigantic ring
around the whole German line. The
second two were aimed at both sides
of Warsaw. A simultaneous offen
sive by all four would have forced
the Germans to yank reserves away
from the Polish capital to protect
themselves from encirclement and
thus lose the place, being forced into
a hasty retreat toward the Oder or
else a battle against superior num
bers in open ground whose issue
would he decided in the beginning.
Sorry Record
But these arms have had a sorry
record. The first made a short thrust
that put it across the Narew, and
then settled down to enjoy the coun
tryside. The second at one time
fired a few guns to let the world
know it was still in existence, a
thousand to be exact. The two
around Warsaw lost a valuable and
excellently placed ally in the form
of General Bor.
At last, however, there are reports
of a Russian lunge through the
tangled mass of the East Prussian
forests, which may .signal the open
ing of the awaited offensive along
the Vistula. This, coupled with our
Aachen drive, might succeed in giv
ing the wanting effect of simultane
ousness necessary to bring the war
to an early end.
Perhaps the most regretable features of the present news is the relative
quiet along the line of the Vistula. It represents a fact which probably has
allowed the Germans to prolong the war unnecessarily. It is, namely, that,
while each of the two separate major fronts has been active, the other has
been either consolidating or else outright blocked. This has allowed the
Germans to operate on interior lines ♦

j and thus double the effectiveness of
their manpower. While the former
lack of co-ordination could be
blamed, to some extent, on the great
evil of coalition warfare and the lack
of a supreme, overall commander, the
present seems to be due to some
strategically questionable Russian
operations.
In order to understand why these
! moves on the chessboard of the East
! ern Front are open to somewhat
critical review, it is necessary to un
{ derstand the military concept of the
j decisive point. On every battle line
| there is one sector where a break

my's equilibrium and defeat him as

again, a look at a map will show that
this threat would be long in develop
ing. For the present, the Germans
can ignore it, since it would not be
critical until Allied columns reached
1 the Austrian border. There, the
j Germans could attempt to establish
j a good and narrow line of defense,
j Meanwhile, they are at liberty to
concentrate their attention in the
West. If they were faced with the
problem of simultaneously defend

ihey probably wouldn't have dared

Allied victory.
Lithuanian Drive
The second operation is the drive
! into Lithuania. This bulge in the
' Russian flanks would hardly make a
j good base for a German counter
, offensive as il is effectively cut off
; from anything but a small stream
of supplies. Yet the Russians have
j diverted large resources of man
power and materiel into a major
offensive to wipe out this pocket,
when they could have much more
j simply contained it.
Meanwhile the Vistula line is si
lent, too much being diverted to the
Balkans and Baltics for an offen
| sive here. The Russians had a chance
i for four simultaneous drives in the
j form of concentric pincers that could
have quickly and efficiently defeated
the Germans. The first, or northern
most arm, was between East Prussia
and Warsaw, and the second, or

southernmost one, was the long
wedge which Marshal Konev was
thrusting towards Krakow. These
two could have tried 1o push to
gether and form a gigantic ring
around the whole German line. The
second two were aimed at both sides
of Warsaw. A simultaneous offen
sive by all four would have forced
the Germans to yank reserves away
from the Polish capital to protect
themselves from encirclement and
thus lose the place, being forced into
a hasty retreat toward the Oder or
else a battle against superior num
bers in open ground whose issue
would he decided in the beginning.
Sorry Record
But these arms have had a sorry
record. The first made a short thrust
that put it across the Narew, and
then settled down to enjoy the coun
tryside. The second at one time
fired a few guns to let the world
know it was still in existence, a
thousand to be exact. The two
around Warsaw lost a valuable and
excellently placed ally in the form
of General Bor.
At last, however, there are reports
of a Russian lunge through the
tangled mass of the East Prussian
forests, which may .signal the open
ing of the awaited offensive along
the Vistula. This, coupled with our
Aachen drive, might succeed in giv
ing the wanting effect of simultane
ousness necessary to bring the war
to an early end.
Perhaps the most regretable features of the present news is the relative
quiet along the line of the Vistula. It represents a fact which probably has
allowed the Germans to prolong the war unnecessarily. It is, namely, that,
while each of the two separate major fronts has been active, the other has
been either consolidating or else outright blocked. This has allowed the
Germans to operate on interior lines ♦

j and thus double the effectiveness of
their manpower. While the former
lack of co-ordination could be
blamed, to some extent, on the great
evil of coalition warfare and the lack
of a supreme, overall commander, the
present seems to be due to some
strategically questionable Russian
operations.
In order to understand why these
! moves on the chessboard of the East
! ern Front are open to somewhat
critical review, it is necessary to un
{ derstand the military concept of the
j decisive point. On every battle line
| there is one sector where a break
j through will utterly shatter the ene
my's equilibrium and defeat him as
| thoroughly and as cheaply as pos
j sible. It might be in the center, as
at Austerlitz, or on one of the wings,
! as at the Mareth Line. It is thus the
| duty of the commander to select the
J point of decision and concentrate as
j much as he can there.
Look at Map
; A good map of the present theater
of the Russian war giving a relative
j ly decent idea of the features of the
| terrain, should show where this point
is located. It is along the winding
; and fast-flowing' Vistula. *fhe rea-
J .sons why are that a Russian break

German line back to the Oder itself,
j and offer a chance to invade indus
j trial Silesia and to mass a blow to
J strike toward central Germany it
■ self. The complete defeat of the Nazis
will come only in Germany, where
the mechanized heart of Hitler's war
machine is, and not in Bulgaria,
J Greece, or Lithuania.
Yet the Russians have been strik

ing the Vistula line untouched. The

sian scenic tour through the Balkans,
