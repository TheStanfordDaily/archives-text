# Reg Day Rigors Battled By Once-Eager Indians
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
And so begins another volume of
The Rigors of Reg Day, writ in the
blood and sweat of 2,453 Stanford
regulars, who waded through unend
ing seat-card lines, cussed unhap
pily at ending up in Gymnastics and
Tumbling Class, and forked over
their last $143 for the privilege of
going to college without Men, Money,
or Bill Hyer.
Same Old Farm
Just walking around the campus
we came to the decision that things
haven't changed much. Of course
the men have dwindled a bit more,
the time schedules have grown a

little more hectic, and Hayes Hunter
is revolutionizing the '45 edition of
the Quad, but all in all, things are
just about the same.
Whenever we tried to interview
fellow inmates on the situation, tliey
would see old lab partners or room
mates, and would have no more time
for the sombre side of life, or quotes
for Ye Stanford Daily.
"Good to See Yuli"
But Mr. Evans, "the-man-behind
thc-P.0.-window," expressed the
sentiments of all when he said, "It's
good to see everyone running around
Quad (and the P. 0.) again. This
summer was kind of dead without
them."
The Cellar is the same happy mad
house. Ask Pete, the Cellar man.
Greta Siemens, new freshman hail
ing from Marvelous Marin, said that
the inverted ratio isn't much like
her idea of college, but shrugged
with the prediction that the war
would be over one day. Right you
are, Greta.
Bower Takes a Bow
Dick Bower, returning to campus
from the Navy, confessed that the
girl situation is becoming acute, but
was delighted to find that Bay Mea
dows was open. As for Rey Day,"it
gets worse and worse,'' Dick said.
From behind the crucial line of
students lining up to pass in their
Reg Books before the deadline and
thetwo-dollar fine, Jo Glasson sighed
that "the lines get longer and longer."
Sally McAllister and Virginia
Walker, taking the long road home,
vowed that they'd never go through
it again. Lives there a man with
soul so dead who hasn't sometime
said the same darn thing?
We asked Mr. King his opinion,
and he smilingly replied that his
mind had been a blank all day.
This may or may not have anything
to do with Reg Day.

Tumbling Class, and forked over
their last $143 for the privilege of
going to college without Men, Money,
or Bill Hyer.
Same Old Farm
Just walking around the campus
we came to the decision that things
haven't changed much. Of course
the men have dwindled a bit more,
the time schedules have grown a

little more hectic, and Hayes Hunter
is revolutionizing the '45 edition of
the Quad, but all in all, things are
just about the same.
Whenever we tried to interview
fellow inmates on the situation, tliey
would see old lab partners or room
mates, and would have no more time
for the sombre side of life, or quotes
for Ye Stanford Daily.
"Good to See Yuli"
But Mr. Evans, "the-man-behind
thc-P.0.-window," expressed the
sentiments of all when he said, "It's

Greta Siemens, new freshman hail
ing from Marvelous Marin, said that
the inverted ratio isn't much like
her idea of college, but shrugged

from the Navy, confessed that the

was delighted to find that Bay Mea
dows was open. As for Rey Day,"it
gets worse and worse,'' Dick said.
From behind the crucial line of
students lining up to pass in their
Reg Books before the deadline and
thetwo-dollar fine, Jo Glasson sighed
that "the lines get longer and longer."
Sally McAllister and Virginia
Walker, taking the long road home,
vowed that they'd never go through
it again. Lives there a man with
soul so dead who hasn't sometime
said the same darn thing?
We asked Mr. King his opinion,
and he smilingly replied that his
mind had been a blank all day.
This may or may not have anything
to do with Reg Day.
And so begins another volume of
The Rigors of Reg Day, writ in the
blood and sweat of 2,453 Stanford
regulars, who waded through unend
ing seat-card lines, cussed unhap
pily at ending up in Gymnastics and
Tumbling Class, and forked over
their last $143 for the privilege of
going to college without Men, Money,
or Bill Hyer.
