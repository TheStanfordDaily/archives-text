## Cards Whip Browns, 3-1; Win 1944 World Series 
### 
SPORTSMEN'S PARK, ST. LOUIS,
Oct. 9 (UP). —The St. Louis Car
dinals won the World Series with a
sixth-game 3 to 1 victory over the
St. Louis Browns today as the Hit
le.ss Wonders, who took their first
American League flag on fielding,
fell apart at the seams to lose the
prize on unearned runs.
It was a drab finish for a listless
series and a poor crowd of only
31,630 fans made little noise except
for one brief period when the
Brownies took a one-run lead in the
second inning. But the Cinderella
club's championship carriage turned
back into a pumpkin in the fourth
frame, and everyone—including the
Brownies—seemed to feel that there
went the ball game and the series
as the Cardinals came through with
their three big runs, two of them
unearnde.
Lanier Beats Poller
Max Lanier, the Carolina south
paw, was the winner, as he went
five and one-third innings before
being relieved by Ted Wilks. The
Cardinals battered Nelson Potter,
leading winner of the Browns this
season, and two successors for ten
hits.
In the end it was the story that
had been expected. The Brownies
were just not in the same class with
the Cards after the Red Birds shook

the slump in which they had ended
the season. The Browns regained
that "Hitless Wonder" tag as they
got but three hits off Lanier and
none off Wilks and as their touted
pitching failed to stop those boom
ing Cardinal bats they fell apart on
defense, contributing two errors
today.
Browns Fade
The Brownies were in there for
the first two innings, and it looked
as if they might be available to
square the series, after scoring one
run in the second. But they faded
out then, particularly after those
three in the Cardinals' fourth.
They had two consolations. The
first was the $.1,000 each member of
the Brownies received. The other
was in helping create a new series
pitching record of total strikeouts
for both clubs. Lanier and Wilks
chalked up nine and the Brownies
contributed five for fourteen, which
boosted the strikeouts in the six
games to a total of 92—5 over the all
time record of 87, established in 1931.
The Cardinals' satisfaction was
$1,100 greater, to the tune of $4,100
per man.
Browns —010 000 000— run, 3 hits,
2 errors.
Cards—ooo 300 OOx—3lo 0.
Batteries — Browns: Potter, Mon
crieff, Kramer and Haworth. Cards:
Lanier, Wilks and W. Cooper.
