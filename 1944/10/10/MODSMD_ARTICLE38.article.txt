The beginning of autumn quar
ter marks the beginning of Stan- ;
ford's second (and last, we hope) '
wartime year without intercolle
giate athletics. Yessir, things are
really tuff all over, and nobody
mourns the slack sports situation
on the Farm more than the sports
staff of Ye Olde Stanford Daily.
Time was when we could easily
fill a page or two this size every day
with local sports news. Today it
takes a world series game to enable
us to fill a corner of the page.
Things won't be quite so bad after
the quarter gets under way. We
have a swell sports staff returning,
including Gordon Levy and Mort
Cohen, who did a fine job of handling j
teh page during the summer, and
Bill Adams.

There will be plenty of intramural
news to keep the boys busy this i
quarter, with football heading the !
autumn list of sports. Harry Wolter, |
Director of Intramural Sports, is j
away for the quarter, and his sue- j
cessor as intramural head has not
as yet been named.
Watch the sports page of the !
Daily for news of the formation
of the mural football league, which
will probably begin in the next
week or two. Now is the time to j
start organizing ball clubs in the
living groups.
We got some inside dope yester
day, which we'll pass on to you for
what it's worth, that Gerona A.C.
will be the team to beat in mural
football this season. The Gerona
Boys have an all-star aggregation
headed by Dave Brown, who played ;
end for the last Big Red Machine in
'42. Dave was at U.C.L.A. in the

V-12 last year, but is back at Stan
ford in Med School now.
Our board of experts, which did
so well in predicting the results of
intercollegiate football games last
quarter, will be back again this year
(with a few changes in the lineup,
most of them due to the war).
We are all eagerly awaiting the
end of the war and the reutnr of
"athletics as usual." In the mean
time, the Daily will continue to
make the most of the situation as
isâ€”we'll give our lull support to
the intramural program, and we'll
do our best to keep you informed
on the activities of former Stan
ford stars who are now fighting
under other colors.
