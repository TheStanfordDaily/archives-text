ics, physics, chemistry, English, his
tory, and geography.
Besides academic testing and indi
vidual counseling, the student sol
diers. will be given a series of ori

tion and discipline, the cadet system,
and morals. John Bunn, dean of
men at Stanford, v/ill speak to the

campus, which will include a trip to
the top of famed Hoover Tower.

the states of California, Oregon,
Washington, Nevada, Utah, Arizona,
and Montana. The group includes
boys who will be able to complete
three quarters of University work
before reaching the age of 18. Others
