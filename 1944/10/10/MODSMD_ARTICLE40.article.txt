# Palm Drive Leads to New Life for Frosh Women
## 
### JUNE SELDER 
Through the eyes of a freshman,
Palm Drive is an avenue to a new,
exciting life—one to be filled with
study, fellowship, and new experi
ence.
Frightening as the prospect may
seem at first, the freshman soon dis
cards his fears when he begins to
feel as if he's a genuine part, of the
Stanford Family.
If one is not overcome completely
by the anticipation of college, it is
possible to realize the beauty of the
surroundings—the stately palms lin
ing the drive, the low, graceful build
ings that dominate the Stanford
campus. Hoover Tower, in its white
glory, a lasting impression. The
rolling hills in the background com
plete a perfect picture of the Stan
ford Farm.
Twisting along the tree-lined
streets leading to the dorms, the
freshman is bursting with eagerness.
He is eager to meet new people;
eager to see where he's going to live;
eager to discover new intellectual
vistas; yes, even eager to find what
kind of food he's going to exist on
during the following months. Not
even in moments as this, does the
freshma nforget his persistent appe
tite.
Rounding the last corner, the
freshman sees, for the first time,
"home." It is "home" from the very
first moment one lays his eyes upon
Roble, Toyon, Branner, or one of the
other dorms.
Walking up the steps, staggering

under the load of tennis rackets,
suitcases, and numerous useless but
beloved articles, the freshman feels
proud and happy to belong to the
great "Stanford Family."
