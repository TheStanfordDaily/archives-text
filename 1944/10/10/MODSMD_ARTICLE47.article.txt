### 
War Board Coordinator, Jeannette
Grimsley, announced today that
though no new plans had yet been
considered, there would be the same
committees, and the same urgent
plea for all students, both men and
women, to sign up for war work.
At the first house meeting of the
various living groups lists of what
will be counted as war work will be
passed around. Each woman is asked
to pledge 8 hours a month, and the
men as much as they can.
War work will be divided into two
different categories: that work which
is directly connected with the na
tional • war effort, and that work
which students are now doing that
they ordinarily wouldn't be doing.
In the latter category are such jobs
as hashing.
The system of the men's war work
is about the same as that of the
women, the object is different. It is
mainly to have a record of what
kind of war work they are doing.
