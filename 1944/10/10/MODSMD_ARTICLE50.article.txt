# Ruhr Basin Is Great War Prize
## 
### 
The Ruhr Basin, facing assault by '
three Allied Armies and two Air
Forces, is one of the greatest war
prizes within Germany's borders.
Small geographically, but fabulously
rich as a coal and steel center, the
Ruhr is the arsenal of Nazidom and
one of the world's most highly de
veloped and concentrated industrial
areas, says the National Geographic
Society.
This fiat, ugly "black country" of
mines and foundries is near Ger
many's western frontier, only 15 to
60 miles from the Netherlands bor

j del - . The United States First Army
breaking past the Reich's boundary
at Aachen is poised within 22 miles
of the Ruhr's southern limits.
Bombed almost continuously for
more than three years, the Ruhr still
provides the foundation for German
industrial war might. Its basic wealth
is coal, and coal mines are hard to
bomb out of commission. Its iron
and steel plants, fed by domestic,
French, and Swedish ores, have
somehow managed to retain for the
area the position as the number one
heavy industrial center of the Reich.
