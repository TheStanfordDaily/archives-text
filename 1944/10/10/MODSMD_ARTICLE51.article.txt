# Society Tells Story of Metz

### 
Metz, toward which American
tanks have been plunging, is only
25 miles southwest of the German
border near the Luxembourg cor
ner, says the National Geographic
Society. It is at the meeting place
of the Moselle and Seille rivers.
Along with the old provinces of
Lorraine and Alsace, Metz has been
a football between France and Ger
many during the past century.
During German possession, 1870
to 1918, it was developed into one of
the most heavily fortified cities of
Europe. Immediately after Germany
took over thousands of French in
habitants left the city. Later there
was a marked development and it
was necessary for the Germans to
destroy the old ramparts to make
room for additional rows of houses,
but the growing city needed still
more room and spread to the islands
in the Moselle River, crossed by
fourteen bridges. At the outbreak
of the second World War Metz had
85.000 inhabitants.
The minette iron field, which ex
tends from a little south of Nancy
to the Belgian border, and coal from
the Vosges deposits and the exten
sion of the Saar field into Lorraine,
favored thedevelopment of an iron
and steel industry at Metz. Germany
introduced themaking of strawberry
and plum preserves which had be
come a principal industry.
It was from Metz that the young

captain of dragoons, Lafayette, be
gan his flight to America to aid
George Washington.â€”National Geo
