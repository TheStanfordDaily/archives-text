# American Smash At Rhine Recalls World War I
## 
### 
Americans battling their way into western Germany with the other
Allied forces are following the footsteps of an earlier generation of U S
fighting men, according to the National Geographic Society. The Ameri
can Army of Occupation slogged through wintry Germany in 1918 as far
as the Rhine and even to the cast bank of the Germans' most important
river.
But the 1918 advance on the Rhine was without opposition. It took place
in accordance with the terms of the ♦

| Armistice.
On November 17, 1918, four Allied
j armies moved eastward into an al
ready conquered Germany to estab
lish occupation headquarters at des
ignated cities, the Americans at Ko
blenz, the French at Mainz, the Brit-
I sih at Cologne, and the Belgians at
j Aachen. The first three took over
also a bridgehead each on the Rhine's
east bank opposite their respective
headquarters, a semicircle of terri
i tory with an 18-mile radius. From
j these bridgeheads the Allied armies
: would theoretically be ready to ad
vance farther toward Berlin if occu
pation of the Rhineland appeared in
adequate. The Americans "reached
the Rhine by December 9, and were
established in their assigned district
by December 14.
Within six months most of the
200,000 U.S. troops involved in the
J occupation had been withdrawn and
| sent home. A detachment of about
J 6,800 men, however, remained in the
Rhineland for three years longer.
The American flag was hauled down
on January 24, 1923, and their sector
was turned over to the French.
Foreign occupation of the Rhine
j land came to an end in 1930. Six
years later the return of German
: armies to the demilitarized Rhine
I district signaled the Nazis' defiance
of the Versailles Treaty.
