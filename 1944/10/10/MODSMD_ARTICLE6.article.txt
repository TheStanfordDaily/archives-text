### 
Fighting their way through the
I crowded lines that coiled out through
(he doors of the Ad building onto
the Quad to re-establish the famous
2-1 ratio—in reverse—B2B civilian
men and 1625 women yesterday reg
istered for fall quarter, according to
! Registrar J. P. Mitchell.
The total of 2453 civilian students
| lops last year's fall civilian registha
| tion of 21575 by 78. At that time there
j w6re 950 civilian men and 1425
| women registering.
However, 257 ASTRP and ASTP
I students plus 88 Civil Affairs Train
ing Service (a group of Army offi
| cers) brought the total male enroll
ment at Stanford this quarter to 1273
j and smoothed the ratio down to a
mere 1.28-1 in favor of the women.
|
Total Army enrollment thus stood
jat 345, about one-tenth of Army
| registration last fall quarter. The
[ sharp drop in Army registration over
last fall thus reduced total registra
j tion from approximately 5000 to 2798,
I a drop of some 2312.
j That a larger percentage of yes
( terday's registration than ever be
fore were freshmen was reflected in
the fact that 70 per cent of those reg
istering were under 21.
Late registrations tomorrow and
the rest of this week were expected
to swell both the Army and civilian
registration totals, according to the
Registrar's office.
