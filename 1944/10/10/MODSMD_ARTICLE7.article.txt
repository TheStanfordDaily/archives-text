# THEY CAME; THEY CONQUERED

At 7:15 the Education Auditorium
doors were tightly locked, blocking
the Frosh Women en masse from at
tending their Pre-Reg Assembly.
The growing crowd took the situa
tion philosophically. This was only
one of the many unexplainable dif
ficulties for them. Strains of "Come
Join the Band" and "Sons of the
Stanford Red" floated out into the
night, while the Committee in
Charge considered the possibilities
of a torch light meeting in the middle
of the street.
Frantic phoning and rushing in all
directions, coupled with the full co
operation of the police department,
finally produced results. Two keys
arrived simultaneously to open the
doors at 7:35.
