# Juan Rael Tells Stories Of Mexican Labor Camp
## 
### NADA SKIDMORE 
After eight summer weeks as as
sistant manager of a,camp for 350
Mexican nationals, Juan B. Rael is
back on the campus in his post as
associate professor of Spanish—
loaded down with sombreros, sou
venirs, and tokens of friendship piled
on him by the Mexican laborers.
The camp was located at Merced,
and managed by C. T. Christanson,
former Stanford student and assist
ant in Spanish. It was opened to
house nationals working in Califor
nia orchards and fields shortly after
the beginning of the war, and will
continue for the duration. The Mexi
cans, who are under contract for six
months or more, now occupy build
ings formerly used for Japanese on
the Pacific Coast.
"Mr. rixit"
Shortly after arrival, Mr. Rael dis
covered that his duties included be
ing a doctor, payroll worker, and
general confidant to the several hun
dred laborers. His most frequent role
was (hat of "Mr. Fixit" for homesick
Mexicans who lost appetite and am
bition in the face of the horror of
American food.
Good old American pressed ham?
They sneered at it and uttered the
Mexican equivalent of G1 Joe's fav
orite complaint. Hotcakes were their
dish, preferably stolen from the
breakfast table and discovered, limp
and soggy, clinging to the bottom of a
lunch box.
"Sign with X"
"Most of the nationals had never
learned to read or write, and signed
checks with an 'X'," Mr. Rael com
mented. After an overflow of 'X'ed
checks hit the camp, it was found
that some of the literate workers
had taken the shortcut for conveni
ence sake. Meanwhile the managers
sweated over stacks of checks
marked simply, "X."
Swiggling down a few spoonsful
of bitter medicine with a grimace,
one national yelled, reached for a
glass of cold water, and lied after

soothing his tonsils with the liquid.
Sniffing the glass, Rael and his "ac
complices" deduced that the terrified
Mexican had consumed a pint of
antiseptic. Their victim never came
back.
Wages Unbelievable
American wages were unbelievable
to the laborers. In a day one Mexi
can earned 26 dollars—more than he
would have earned in two months
below the border. Working on the
contract basis, most of the nationals
sent at least $180 home every two
I weeks.
"The peons of Mexico have a folk
music all their own," Rael remarked.
"One of the most interesting features
of the summer was listening to the
music and songs they composed and
played themselves." According to
Rael, a long ballad was composed by
a laborer describing his travels in
Mexico. Wyoming, and on the way
to the coast, all of which was fol
lowed by a specialty, "Farewell to
California." A recording was made
' of the former, but before he left Rael
discovered that the Mexican had
taken both the recording and the
memorized version back to Mexico
with him, where originals conic a
dime a dozen.
"Lotsa Spcches"
Five thousand nationals attended
a two-day program at Merced on
September 15 and 16, celebrating
the Mexican day of independence.
"We want songs, dances, and lotsa
speches," the Mexican representa
tives told the committee in charge of
the festival. And they got them all.
A beauty queen for the day was
| chosen from the ranks of Mexican
j women living around Merced, and
reigned over the main dance. With
an admission charge of $1.20, the
i groups made over $800 profit and the
festival was a success both finan
cially and socially for lonesome
Mexicans "north of the border" help
ing save 1944's harvest. The Spanish
1 professor's summer had been a defi
i nite success, too, Rael added.

the Pacific Coast.
"Mr. rixit"
Shortly after arrival, Mr. Rael dis
covered that his duties included be
ing a doctor, payroll worker, and
general confidant to the several hun
dred laborers. His most frequent role
was (hat of "Mr. Fixit" for homesick
Mexicans who lost appetite and am
bition in the face of the horror of
American food.
Good old American pressed ham?
They sneered at it and uttered the
Mexican equivalent of G1 Joe's fav
orite complaint. Hotcakes were their
dish, preferably stolen from the
breakfast table and discovered, limp
and soggy, clinging to the bottom of a
lunch box.
"Sign with X"
"Most of the nationals had never
learned to read or write, and signed
checks with an 'X'," Mr. Rael com
mented. After an overflow of 'X'ed
checks hit the camp, it was found
that some of the literate workers
had taken the shortcut for conveni
ence sake. Meanwhile the managers
sweated over stacks of checks
marked simply, "X."
Swiggling down a few spoonsful
of bitter medicine with a grimace,
one national yelled, reached for a
glass of cold water, and lied after

soothing his tonsils with the liquid.
Sniffing the glass, Rael and his "ac
complices" deduced that the terrified
Mexican had consumed a pint of
antiseptic. Their victim never came
back.
Wages Unbelievable
American wages were unbelievable
to the laborers. In a day one Mexi
can earned 26 dollars—more than he
would have earned in two months
below the border. Working on the
contract basis, most of the nationals
sent at least $180 home every two
I weeks.
"The peons of Mexico have a folk
music all their own," Rael remarked.
"One of the most interesting features
of the summer was listening to the
music and songs they composed and
played themselves." According to
Rael, a long ballad was composed by
a laborer describing his travels in
Mexico. Wyoming, and on the way
to the coast, all of which was fol
lowed by a specialty, "Farewell to
California." A recording was made
' of the former, but before he left Rael
discovered that the Mexican had
taken both the recording and the
memorized version back to Mexico
with him, where originals conic a
dime a dozen.
"Lotsa Spcches"
Five thousand nationals attended
a two-day program at Merced on
September 15 and 16, celebrating
the Mexican day of independence.
"We want songs, dances, and lotsa
speches," the Mexican representa
tives told the committee in charge of
the festival. And they got them all.
A beauty queen for the day was
| chosen from the ranks of Mexican
j women living around Merced, and
reigned over the main dance. With
an admission charge of $1.20, the
i groups made over $800 profit and the
festival was a success both finan
cially and socially for lonesome
Mexicans "north of the border" help
ing save 1944's harvest. The Spanish
1 professor's summer had been a defi
i nite success, too, Rael added.
After eight summer weeks as as
sistant manager of a,camp for 350
Mexican nationals, Juan B. Rael is
back on the campus in his post as
associate professor of Spanish—
loaded down with sombreros, sou
venirs, and tokens of friendship piled
on him by the Mexican laborers.
The camp was located at Merced,
and managed by C. T. Christanson,
former Stanford student and assist
ant in Spanish. It was opened to
house nationals working in Califor
nia orchards and fields shortly after
the beginning of the war, and will
continue for the duration. The Mexi

learned to read or write, and signed
checks with an 'X'," Mr. Rael com
mented. After an overflow of 'X'ed
checks hit the camp, it was found
that some of the literate workers
had taken the shortcut for conveni
ence sake. Meanwhile the managers
sweated over stacks of checks
marked simply, "X."
Swiggling down a few spoonsful
of bitter medicine with a grimace,
one national yelled, reached for a
glass of cold water, and lied after

soothing his tonsils with the liquid.
Sniffing the glass, Rael and his "ac
complices" deduced that the terrified
Mexican had consumed a pint of
antiseptic. Their victim never came
back.
Wages Unbelievable
American wages were unbelievable
to the laborers. In a day one Mexi
can earned 26 dollars—more than he
would have earned in two months
below the border. Working on the
contract basis, most of the nationals
sent at least $180 home every two
I weeks.
"The peons of Mexico have a folk
music all their own," Rael remarked.
"One of the most interesting features
of the summer was listening to the
music and songs they composed and
played themselves." According to
Rael, a long ballad was composed by
a laborer describing his travels in
Mexico. Wyoming, and on the way
to the coast, all of which was fol
lowed by a specialty, "Farewell to
California." A recording was made
' of the former, but before he left Rael
discovered that the Mexican had
taken both the recording and the
memorized version back to Mexico
with him, where originals conic a
dime a dozen.
"Lotsa Spcches"
Five thousand nationals attended
a two-day program at Merced on
September 15 and 16, celebrating
the Mexican day of independence.
"We want songs, dances, and lotsa
speches," the Mexican representa
tives told the committee in charge of
the festival. And they got them all.
A beauty queen for the day was
| chosen from the ranks of Mexican
j women living around Merced, and
reigned over the main dance. With
an admission charge of $1.20, the
i groups made over $800 profit and the
festival was a success both finan
cially and socially for lonesome
Mexicans "north of the border" help
ing save 1944's harvest. The Spanish
1 professor's summer had been a defi
i nite success, too, Rael added.
