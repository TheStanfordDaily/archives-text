# THE
						HOTTEST ELECTION
## 
### 
This is just a memorandum for all Stanford citizens over 21
who are eligible to vote in one of the hottest national elections of
all time: check on registration, make sure that your records are
in order, and be sure to obtain absentee ballots now.
At this time, one of the most crucial in our history, it is espe-1
cially urgent that everyone take advantage of the opportunity
to express his opinion on the future of the government. When
the polls close on the night of Nov. 7, 1944, the American people
shall have expressed their opinion irrevocably as to the admini-1
stration under which our collective affairs shall be conducted
for the next four years.
Every citizen who considers himself worthy of rights under
this government should vote. This is especially true of those
well informed on national issues, as college students are pre-!
sumed to be.
This election is a vital one. Make sure that your voice is
heard when the totals begin to roll in; now is the time to check
up.
