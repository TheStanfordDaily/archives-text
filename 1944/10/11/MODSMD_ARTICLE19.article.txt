### Dick Crane 
It seems as if my article of yesterday had quite a few reper
cussions, and that quite a lot of people are following my sug
gestions about taking care of the existing ratio between men and
women on this campus.
Hayes Hunter, the new editor of the Quad, approached me
this morning in the Cellar, and mentioned the fact that there is
to be a search for campus queens, and when said girls are
chosen, they are to have their pictures pasted in the Quad, and
various other places that I can't mention in a newspaper.
It's not enough that he has fifty thousand gals running around
the Quad office, he has to start a campaign for more. Dave Davis
the editor of this paper will be on the judge's bench, as will Mr.
Hunter, Barbara White, our A.S.S.U. president, and various other
people, including myself if I can bribe or beg my way in some
how. I
The whole thing seems to be as Jimmy Durante says, "Every
booly wants to get into the act!"
For all the gory details, you can read the news articles of
the Daily, but I will elaborate just a little bit, so that you will get
the "feel of the thing."
The various titles of the queens will probably read something
like this: "Queen of Dinahs," "Queen of Belts," and undoubtedly
a super job called: "Queen of Boozers." Then there will no doubt
be: "Queen of Hots," "Queen of Cold," "Queen of Smooth,"
Queen of Bags," and an over-all queen of this group. What
call her though, beats the hell out of me. Do any of
you have some lewd suggestions?
I have been doing a little thinking (no cracks!) and I have
Deen wondering why we shouldn't start a "King of the Campus!"
"Sad! women are no longer any novelty around hero, and as far
is I have been able to ascertain, neither are queens. (I hope
.[ will pick up a few points for myself on that last statement). I

know the majority of students on the campus want to know
about MEN! and if the majority is in accordance with my idea,
please leave all correspondence on the subject with Hayes
Hunter at the Quad office immediately.
Throughout today's Session, I have been lampooning this
whole idea, however to strike a serious note, there will be such
a contest conducte dthrougnout the campus. The so-called
queens will no doubt have dressed up titles, but will mean the
same damn thing. You know the old saying, "A rose by any
other name would smell as sweet." So if any of you gals would
be a 8.W.0.C. at Stanford, you had better get on the ball!

like this: "Queen of Dinahs," "Queen of Belts," and undoubtedly
a super job called: "Queen of Boozers." Then there will no doubt
be: "Queen of Hots," "Queen of Cold," "Queen of Smooth,"
Queen of Bags," and an over-all queen of this group. What

I have been doing a little thinking (no cracks!) and I have

Hayes Hunter, the new editor of the Quad, approached me
this morning in the Cellar, and mentioned the fact that there is
to be a search for campus queens, and when said girls are
chosen, they are to have their pictures pasted in the Quad, and
various other places that I can't mention in a newspaper.
It's not enough that he has fifty thousand gals running around
the Quad office, he has to start a campaign for more. Dave Davis
the editor of this paper will be on the judge's bench, as will Mr.
Hunter, Barbara White, our A.S.S.U. president, and various other
people, including myself if I can bribe or beg my way in some
how. I
The whole thing seems to be as Jimmy Durante says, "Every
