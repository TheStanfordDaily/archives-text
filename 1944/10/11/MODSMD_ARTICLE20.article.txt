The Editor, Sir:
I don't think "Veterans" should be pegged as such. Along
with a tag like that goes the obvious question, "why dismissed?"
Spoken, or unspoken, it's there, and the person concerned would
probably rather forget.
I happened to see the list of boys returning to school, and I
found in it the names of boys whom I know, and whom I have
worked with. I didn't know they were "veterans"; they were
just part of the gang. And that's the way it should be.
Don't club them together and label them as a separate class.
They're all Stanford students now. They deserve all the friend
ship we have to offerâ€”and we can offer a lot.
Sincerely,
Margaret Morgan, '45
