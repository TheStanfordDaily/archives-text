Aachen under siege is the main news of the day, and it signifies the defi
nite breaching of the Siegfried Line. The city's fall will allow us to com
mence a large-scale invasion of the Rhineland to terminate the Battle of
the West Wall, and yet the seizure of Aachen will give us only a base of
operations, despite the fact that it is a very good base. Heavy fighting, at

j least of a rearguard nature is prob-^
ably in the making before we reach
1 the Rhine, and the capture of this
area will still leave us with the prob- j
lem of crossing the river itself.
The most advantageous point about !
S the area from our standpoint is its :
j high degree of industrialization. This |
j not only means that our control of it
| will seriously hamper the Nazi war j
j effort, but, from a more or less tac- i
I tical viewpoint, it signifies that we '
! will have many practical lines of ad
! vance. The capture of a main city
! such as Aachen puts us at the nerve '
! center of a network of railways and j
I inroads that lead to many other j
| strategic points, so the German High
i Command will be forced to spread
! out its defenses. In addition, lateral i
; communications are good, and thus
J we can unite our main strength at j
j any single point where the Germans
j might want to concentrate. Thus we
can operate in the best tradition of '
i Von Molkte's famous axiom: "March j
i divided and fight united." This will
immensely facilitate our coming cam
| paign.
Lines of Advance Along Railroads
Thus it can also be seen that our
\ lines of advance from Aachen are j
governed by the railways leading :
\ from the place eastward to the !
Rhine. These are three in number.
: The northernmost crosses the river !
| at thecity of Duisberg. The central
one leads to the much bombed manu- j
facturing center of Dusseldorf, and
the southernmost, out towards Co- '
logne. About seventeen miles east
I of Aachen, along the road to Dussel- !
i dorf, at a town called Julick, two 1
j new lines branch oil.
One heads out to Cologne while
| the other moves southward to a city
about seventeen imles south of Co
logne, Bonn. The average distance
! from Aachen to each one of these
| points is about fifty miles.
Possibility of Drive to Nazi "Stalin
grad"
A simultaneous drive along the
whole front would bring us to the
j Rhine on a front from Duisberg to
| Bonn, about fifty miles in length, and
would extend the Nazi defenses well
| beyond the perimeter of Cologne:
"The German Stalingrad," as Dr.
i Goebbels calls it. But it must be
remarked that the capture of Aachen
i does not completely open the road to
all or any of these points. There is
I one more natural barrier, the River
Ruhr, running across all the lines
about seventeen miles east of Aachen,
this stream flowing through Julich.
, The Germans might yet organize a

stand along the Rohr, and their re
; sistance around Aachen definitely
■ shows that they have strength
| enough to put up a stiff fight.

Aachen under siege is the main news of the day, and it signifies the defi
nite breaching of the Siegfried Line. The city's fall will allow us to com
mence a large-scale invasion of the Rhineland to terminate the Battle of
the West Wall, and yet the seizure of Aachen will give us only a base of
operations, despite the fact that it is a very good base. Heavy fighting, at

j least of a rearguard nature is prob-^
ably in the making before we reach
1 the Rhine, and the capture of this
area will still leave us with the prob- j
lem of crossing the river itself.
The most advantageous point about !
S the area from our standpoint is its :
j high degree of industrialization. This |
j not only means that our control of it
| will seriously hamper the Nazi war j
j effort, but, from a more or less tac- i
I tical viewpoint, it signifies that we '
! will have many practical lines of ad
! vance. The capture of a main city
! such as Aachen puts us at the nerve '
! center of a network of railways and j
I inroads that lead to many other j
| strategic points, so the German High
i Command will be forced to spread
! out its defenses. In addition, lateral i
; communications are good, and thus
J we can unite our main strength at j
j any single point where the Germans
j might want to concentrate. Thus we
can operate in the best tradition of '
i Von Molkte's famous axiom: "March j
i divided and fight united." This will
immensely facilitate our coming cam
| paign.
Lines of Advance Along Railroads
Thus it can also be seen that our
\ lines of advance from Aachen are j
governed by the railways leading :
\ from the place eastward to the !
Rhine. These are three in number.
: The northernmost crosses the river !
| at thecity of Duisberg. The central
one leads to the much bombed manu- j
facturing center of Dusseldorf, and
the southernmost, out towards Co- '
logne. About seventeen miles east
I of Aachen, along the road to Dussel- !
i dorf, at a town called Julick, two 1
j new lines branch oil.
One heads out to Cologne while
| the other moves southward to a city
about seventeen imles south of Co
logne, Bonn. The average distance
! from Aachen to each one of these
| points is about fifty miles.
Possibility of Drive to Nazi "Stalin
grad"
A simultaneous drive along the
whole front would bring us to the
j Rhine on a front from Duisberg to
| Bonn, about fifty miles in length, and
would extend the Nazi defenses well
| beyond the perimeter of Cologne:
"The German Stalingrad," as Dr.
i Goebbels calls it. But it must be
remarked that the capture of Aachen
i does not completely open the road to
all or any of these points. There is
I one more natural barrier, the River
Ruhr, running across all the lines
about seventeen miles east of Aachen,
this stream flowing through Julich.
, The Germans might yet organize a

stand along the Rohr, and their re
; sistance around Aachen definitely
■ shows that they have strength
