# Bower Returns To Lambast "Impatient Years"
## 
### 
i THE IMPATIENT YEARS—now 1
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Pardon me for bringing the sub
ject up, but it seems that the Stan- |
ford is currently showing a little j
thing called '"The Impatient Years."
| Jean Arthur and Lee Bowman are
; featured in this listless tale of war
time marriages and their aftermath.
Bowman returns from war to find
that he hardly knows his wife. Miss
i Arthur, whom he married on a four
j day spree before going overseas. Fi
nally they decide on a divorce—that
is, until father-in-law Charles Co
| burn steps in and solves their prob
lem via the Hollywood manner. The
solution seems both impractical and
| improbable to this reviewer.
"The Impatient Years" just doesn't
j jell, due mainly to poor dialogue
and direction. Nothing outstanding
from the acting standpoint, with the
possible exception of Jane Darwell's
| bit part as the minister's wife. While
j "The Impatient Years" poses a seri
-1 ous problem, the total result of the
i film bears the Hollywood seal of ap
j proval.
I And who should we meet in the
second "hit." None other than our
! old friend Jean Parker, the queen
| of the "B's." This time Jean dons
j the uniform of the WAVES and flirts
with the sailors in "The Navy Way."
; The picture was filmed at Great
j Lakes, Illinois, and supposedly de
! picts the adventures of a group of
j recruits in boot camp. There was no
| Jean Parker to hold my hand or
anybody else's around Great Lakes
j and let's hope there never will be.
The shots of boot training may in
| terest you, the story certainly not.
Miss Parker was up at Great Lakes
■ while I was there for the world pre
j miere of "The Navy Way," and
| fortunately I was unable to attend,
i Let s'hope that you have the same
luck at the Stanford. Shows are con
! tinuous all day so you can miss this
| twin bill at any time and still feel
satisfied.—Dick Bower.
