Tickets under the supervision of
Jim Reynolds, are on sale at the
A.S.S.U. office at 60 cents a couple,
and will be sold at the door for late
comers the night of the dance. Does
it not sound enticing? Every true
Stanford "rough" is urged to dash
down to A.S.S.U. office and purchase
a ticket, and then grab the cutest
Indian maid at hand (and there are
plenty (and join the rush to the
Women's Gym on Saturday night.
A Stanford tradition of long stand
ing, the Reg Dance was formerly
held on Registration night and has
always been one of the chief affairs
of the quarter and of Cardinals. For
the benefit of frosh who don't under
stand the purpose of this worthy
group, Cardinals is the activity group
which sponsors and puts on nearly
all A.S.S.U. functions, such as dances
and the Con Home and Red Cross
drives.
