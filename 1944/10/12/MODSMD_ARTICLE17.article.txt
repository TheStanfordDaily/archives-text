The Cellar Store is fortunate at present in having a fairly
good supply of that staple in Farm student's diet, the cigarette.
But the Cellar Store does not have enough cigarettes for the
folks back home, or for that matter, anybody else but Stanford
students.
There are new people here at Stanford; new, besides fresh
men. Civil Affairs Training Officers, for example, new upper
division students, and the new people are the ones who buy
Cellar cigarettes, wrap them in a cheery little package and send
them off in the U.S. Mails.
This concern for relatives is very touching, but as far as the
weed is concerned, save it for Stanford!
