# AN IVORY TOWER?
## 
### 
How many Stanford students have resolved to keep them
selves posted on current affairs? Have you ever considered just
why you are attending a University? It is so that you may gain
a body of knowledge which will enable you to think and act
intelligently when you are faced with the problems of modern
life.
You are obtaining the background which should make you
a well-informed American citizen. But are you using that back
ground? Knowledge is not meant to be stored away in a folder
of class notes, but to be applied to your thinking and living. You
can put it to good use today, by reading the newspapers and
news magazines, and applying the knowledge you are gaining
in your classrooms to contemporary life. Don't live in an ivory
tower! â€”Patty Patten
