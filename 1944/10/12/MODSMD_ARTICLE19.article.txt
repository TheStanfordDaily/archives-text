I want to write from time to time on words, phrases, and
topics that are peculiar to Stanfordites alone. You v/ill undoubt
edly hear such conversation in your daily rountine as: "Joe is
hashing at Roble this quarter," or "He has the hots for her," or
"I expect to go minus in the Bawlout this year." Such jargon
as the things I have just mentioned sound very strange to alien
ears, which are many this early in the quarter, so I will en
deavor to enlighten them.
Take the term "hasher" for example. Does it attach any
special significance to you new students? Of course not. As
a matter of fact, too many of the older students take the word
too much for granted, so I shall try to impress upon your mem
ory for all the time you spend at Stanford, just what the word
implies, and how you should use it with God-like reverence.
"Hasher," according to the Stanford Dictionary, pertains to
anyone waiting table, mopping floors, picking cigarettes out of
oatmeal, and doing various other diabolical jobs that only a
head hasher can conceive. .
When you are one of these unfortunate persons, you get up
in the middle of the night, dress, and proceed to the kitchen,
where some "jerk," who has had the good fortune to have
worked there for a couple of quarters before you, hollers:
"Whatsamatter! you lazy or somthin." "You'd better get into
that apron before I give you the "sock."
For the rest of the morning you work like mad, and always
with the whip-lash voice of the would-be top sergeant haunting
you. At noon you don't mind the work so much, because you
are fully awake, and able to cope with the situation.
At dinner you have another nightmare, because when all
the rest of the people are going down to drink beer, or going
out for other nefarious purposes, you alone are working like a
demon trying to get the last ten thousand dishes washed. After
all, it's eleven-thirty, with six hours of studying yet to do.
Then when you finally finish your studying, it is time to go
back to the kitchen for breakfast. Taking everything into con
sideration, it's a vicious circle.
All this may have been exaggerated a trifle, as I have been
!<nown to do such a thing in this column. "Hashers," perform a
great service to all students who have the pleasure of eating in
'he University dining halls (open to debate), so whenever you
start complaining of the service, or give a "hasher" hell, just
remember today's column. How do I know of all this? I "HASH."
