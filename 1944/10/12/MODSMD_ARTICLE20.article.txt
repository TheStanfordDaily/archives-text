# WAR FRONTS
## 
### Elliot Epsteen 
Time is the major factor effecting j
the Pacific war today, and the un- j
pleasant fact of the matter is that ;
time is more on the Japanese side 1
than on ours. The Japanese are
faced with the problem of defending j
an island empire with long and !
threatened maritime lines of sup
ply, and defending it against an
enemy with fantastically overwhelm- i
ing naval superiority. They might
solve their dilemma by shifting their j
war potential to China, where their
major army is, and making new sup
ply lines, mostly overland, to their j
chief sources of vital raw materials. {
If we were fighting a normal West
ern people, we could bring a decision |
about by invading Japan itself, no |
matter what happened in China. A j
man feels two duties, to his home '
and to his country. The former, be
ing more personal, is stronger. A
Japanese soldier fighting in China, !
if he were what has here been loosely
termed normal and Western, found i
his homeland threatened, would
probably not feel good no matter
what his present tactical situation
was. When General Grant's clumsy
invasion of Virginia was finally j
checked around Petersburg, the Con
federate army was far from shaken \
and still intact. But, when General
Sherman made his march from Sa
vannah up through the Carolinas, I
and the homes which the Army of j
Northern Virginia had been protect- i
ing in front were now threatened J
from the rear, General Lee began
losing on the average, a whole regi
ment each day through desertion, !
and this while the Union lines fac- j
ing his men were quiet! But it is j
difficult to ponder about Japanese
psychological reactions because they j
appear so utterly different from our
own. Thus the Japanese general staff
might elect to give up Japan with j
only a delaying action, and the Japa- {
nese line might just simply take it as j
all part of the game.
Threat to China
The Japanese have to stabilize their |
position in China before we crush
them in the island war, and their
determined drive through Kwangsi j
province shows that they are trying :
to do just this. The campaign for the
Philippines is at present stalled by
the monsoons, and China is still cut
off from our full aid by land bar- j
riers and a naval blockade. The Chi
nese are trying to stop the enemy at I
Kweilin, a town between two moun- |
tain ranges and easily defendable.
but the Japanese are desperate and i
have an immense superiority in fire i
power and mobility.

Our problem, then, is to reach the
Philippines and land on the China
coast before the Japanese can con
solidate here. It is a race with the
length of the war in the balance, and
the necessity of our consolidating
our ground and cracking island out
post lines before getting at the Phil
ippines, as well,as waiting for the
end of the monsoons, coupled with
China's desperate situation, which
even her great courage does not seem
to be able to overcome, is what makes
thegoal so difficult for us. It might
even be said that the length of the
war in years depends on the number
of months Kweilin holds out.
