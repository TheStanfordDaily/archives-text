# French Film Criticized
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
First-nighters saw the opening
presentation of the Tuesday Evening
Series, '"A Nous la Liberie," a
French comedy film, when it was
shown to a capacity crowd of re
turning students and curious fresh
men at the Memorial Auditorium.
Satirizing big business and its pe
culiarities, the film showed the vicis
situdes of two Frenchmen who be
gan in jail, rose to prosperity, and
ended more happily as hoboes.
Freshmen who were investigating
the prospects of the Series shouJd
not feel let-down; things are bound
to pick up. Interesting to the more
critical onlookers for its technical
failings, the film showed the division
between Hollywood and French tech
niques.
The musical score was thin and
choppy, the photography lacked in
genuity, and the comedy was un
controlled slapstick. But things may
have changed in the French movie
industry since the time of filming,
which your critic would judge to be
the early 'thirties.
