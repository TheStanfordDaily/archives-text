# Masters to Serve on Army Athletic Program Committee
## 
### 
A bid to serve on the civilian com
j mittee of experts for the United
States Army athletic program was
accepted by Alfred R. Masters, gen
j eral manager of Stanford's Board of
i Athletic Control and director of the
: division of athletic management.
The invitation, tendered by Lt. Col.
i Henry VV. Clark, chief of the athletic
branch of the special services divi
sion of the Army Service Forces,
! places Masters on a j>roup charged
with the formation of a program to
i assist commanders in maintaining a
high state of morale and physical fit
ness in members of the armed forces
; following the defeat of Germany and
j during the subsequent period of re
adjustment and demobilization both
I in the United States and overseas.
Masters declared that particular
| emphasis is to be given to the devel
i opment of educational, and recrea
| tional activities. In a preliminary
| report, the committee indicated that
i at such times as the military situa-
I tion in an overseas command per
j mits, purely military instruction will
j be reduced to that necessary for the
j execution of mission, maintenance
and health with the remainder of the
j day being devoted to educational,
athletic, and recreational programs.
Athletics, it is maintained, will
help the soldier maintain sound
physical and mental health, give
J him objective interests and out
; looks, take his mind off himself,
I combat his tendencies to become
moody, self-pitying, and ill-tem
| pered, and give him interests and
skills which he can take into civilian
life.
Heading the civilian committee are
, Ford Flick, National Baseball League
president; Arthur Daley, New York
! Times; Bill Slater, Hearst Radio: and
| Avery Brundage, president of the
j American Sports Federation. Phil -
I lip Badger, NCAA chief, acts as
I chairman.
