# Men Needed; Reg Hon Tomorrow
## Farm Students to Hear 'Big Name Bands' in Gym 
### 
With this quarter's Reg dance only
one day away, it is urgent thai the
"men on campus seize their chance,
with the ratio die way it is," said
Co-chairman Jim Reynolds yester
day in announcing plans for a blind
date bureau for un-dated men.
"Any man who wants a blind date
should get in touch immediately with
his hall supervisor or social chair
man," said Reynolds, "or contact one
of the social chairmen in one of the
women's halls."
The women who are planning the
blind date service in the women's
halls are as follows: Pat Charlton,
Branner; Joan Fullinwider, B. J. Cal
fec, Mnry Lou McClure, Eleanor
Marks, Barbara Stofer, and Helen
Jones in Roble; and Coral Hurwitz
at Madrono.
Reynolds said he hoped that new
men and army men on campus would
lake the hint, and get in touch with
one of these social chairmen immedi
ately if they did not already have a
date. "We'd like to see a really good
turnout at the dance," he said,
Reynolds also issued a special ap
peal for any girls who would be in
terested in working for the dance by
(checking coats, or taking tickets to
call him as soon as possible at Wash
ington Hall.

ization, and is one of the main events
of every quarter. It is scheduled to
start tomorrow night from 9:00 till

only (>0 cents a couple. Tickets are
on sale now at the A.S.S.U. office,
and will be sold at the door for late
