a debating and discussion group will
lie organized at the meeting.
"Debating activities have always
been popular at Stanford and should
be even more so this year, not only
because of the increasing interest in
world affairs but because the cur

unequalled opportunities for travel
and the chance to meet and compete
with students of other universities,"
said Miss Newton.

the debating society include a de
bate with Cal on November 2, the

as well as open-forum discussions
and argumentation among members
of the society.

bating director, will talk informally
at the meeting on debating at Stan
ford, past and present, and will dis
cuss witli the group ihe advantages
of argumentation and the interchange
of ideas in times when an interest
in national and international porb
leins is predominant. Refreshments
will be served at the meeting.
