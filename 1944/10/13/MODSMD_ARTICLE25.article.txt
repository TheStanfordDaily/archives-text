# WAR FRONTS

### Elliot Epsteen 
The shelling of Tilsit and the near termination (with apolo
gies to the British War Office) of the Russian campaign in the
Baltic states seems to signify a coming invasion of East Prussia.
This would probably transmit its main punch along the invasion
routes from Lithuania, and another drive branching out from a
Soviet-held wedge between the Polish capital and the old Teu
tonic province might or might not push into the latter from the
south.
If the operation takes the form of a two-pronged offensive
with both widely separated, then the Russian high command
will have to co-ordinate the movements of each with respect to
the other, or the Germans might turn on them in detail as they
did in a similar situation in 1914.
VALUE OF EAST PRUSSIA
The capture of East Prussia by the Russians would give them
a base for invading northeastern Germany, and, more important
in respect to the situation as it stands now, for a wheeling move
ment designed to take the Nazi lines around Warsaw in reverse.
As far as the latter is concerned, it would probably be better if
they made this lunge now from their positions north of the Polish
capital, eliminating a tedious secondary operation in East Prussia.
The Russians, with their terrific reserves, certainly ought to be
able to make any thrust into their flank abortive.
East Prussia is, by virtue of its terrain, a good defensive posi
tion. It is separated from Lithuania by the broad river Memel,
which the Russians will first have to cross. Then, blocking their
road from the Memel westward, is the Pregel, flowing southward
past Koenigszerg. There is also a thick mass of forests in be
tween, so both armies will fight, to some extent, blindfold—a
situation that is mainly a penalty on the attacker.
DEFENSES IN SOUTHEAST
Any column pushing into the southeastern part of the prov
ince will not have an easier task. There will still be the forests,
and there is, in addition, a chain of lakes and marshes between
which the Germans can make a good stand, since they will be
defending defiles. Behind these there is the Alle, on the banks
of which Napoleon won his great victory of Friedland, which
flows out, roughly, at right angles from the Nieman, protecting
the right flank of a German line around Koenigsberg.
The Germans also have the advantage of interior lines, but
the shifting of troops from one sector of the province to another
depends on the communications nerve center of Koenigsberg.
This should probably thus be one of the first Russian objectives.
IMPORTANCE OF KOENIGSBERG
There is another good reason why Koenigsberg is a prime
objective, besides, of course, the fact that it is the capital of
the province. If the Russians should gain control of the city, they
could drive along the flat Baltic coast, and be able to use their
heavy numerical advantage in the open.
If the Russians should open a major operation in East Prussia,
the Germans might possibly try to fight merely a delaying action
there. The crucial problem of the German high command is the
disposition of its scanty reserves. It might thus slowly draw
its line back to the Vistula, which, as can be seen on the map,
flows behind the province, and still keep its attention focused
on our bulge in the Siegfried Line at Aachen, which is potentially
more of a threat to them.
GERMAN RELUCTANCE
But the German generals might be reluctant to sacrifice the
land where their homes are located, as they were in 1914 when
a plan was suggested to draw their whole line back to a position
running from the mouth of the Vistula to Silesia, and when they
vetoed it and replaced the commander who suggested it with
Ludendorff and Hindenburg.

VALUE OF EAST PRUSSIA
The capture of East Prussia by the Russians would give them
a base for invading northeastern Germany, and, more important
in respect to the situation as it stands now, for a wheeling move
ment designed to take the Nazi lines around Warsaw in reverse.
As far as the latter is concerned, it would probably be better if
they made this lunge now from their positions north of the Polish
capital, eliminating a tedious secondary operation in East Prussia.
The Russians, with their terrific reserves, certainly ought to be
able to make any thrust into their flank abortive.
East Prussia is, by virtue of its terrain, a good defensive posi
tion. It is separated from Lithuania by the broad river Memel,
which the Russians will first have to cross. Then, blocking their
road from the Memel westward, is the Pregel, flowing southward
past Koenigszerg. There is also a thick mass of forests in be
tween, so both armies will fight, to some extent, blindfold—a
situation that is mainly a penalty on the attacker.
DEFENSES IN SOUTHEAST
Any column pushing into the southeastern part of the prov
ince will not have an easier task. There will still be the forests,
and there is, in addition, a chain of lakes and marshes between
which the Germans can make a good stand, since they will be
defending defiles. Behind these there is the Alle, on the banks
of which Napoleon won his great victory of Friedland, which
flows out, roughly, at right angles from the Nieman, protecting
the right flank of a German line around Koenigsberg.
The Germans also have the advantage of interior lines, but
the shifting of troops from one sector of the province to another
depends on the communications nerve center of Koenigsberg.
This should probably thus be one of the first Russian objectives.
IMPORTANCE OF KOENIGSBERG
There is another good reason why Koenigsberg is a prime
objective, besides, of course, the fact that it is the capital of
the province. If the Russians should gain control of the city, they
could drive along the flat Baltic coast, and be able to use their
heavy numerical advantage in the open.
If the Russians should open a major operation in East Prussia,
the Germans might possibly try to fight merely a delaying action
there. The crucial problem of the German high command is the
disposition of its scanty reserves. It might thus slowly draw
its line back to the Vistula, which, as can be seen on the map,
flows behind the province, and still keep its attention focused
on our bulge in the Siegfried Line at Aachen, which is potentially
more of a threat to them.
GERMAN RELUCTANCE
But the German generals might be reluctant to sacrifice the
land where their homes are located, as they were in 1914 when
a plan was suggested to draw their whole line back to a position
running from the mouth of the Vistula to Silesia, and when they
vetoed it and replaced the commander who suggested it with
Ludendorff and Hindenburg.
The shelling of Tilsit and the near termination (with apolo
gies to the British War Office) of the Russian campaign in the
Baltic states seems to signify a coming invasion of East Prussia.
This would probably transmit its main punch along the invasion
routes from Lithuania, and another drive branching out from a
Soviet-held wedge between the Polish capital and the old Teu
tonic province might or might not push into the latter from the
south.
If the operation takes the form of a two-pronged offensive
with both widely separated, then the Russian high command
will have to co-ordinate the movements of each with respect to
the other, or the Germans might turn on them in detail as they
did in a similar situation in 1914.
