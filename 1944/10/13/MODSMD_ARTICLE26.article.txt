The return of the student body from a long and playful sum
mer, that is excluding the group of lads and lassies who cavorted
on the Farm during a summer quarter that was filled with more
than its share of brew, babes, and bull, begins to make the cam
pus look more like a happy, thriving community again.
Everyone is filled with that old spirit and determination to
make up for that "D" in poly sci or some other class that they
know that they should have had a better grade in, only the prof
just didn't understand their viewpoint. This quarter they have
vowed to do better and make momma and papa, who are kicking
out that $143 per quarter, very happy about the whole thing.
And so, little students, we are going to wend our way in to the
first attempt of this dimwit to impart the news of those strata of
students who are considered in the society group, the 8.M.0.C.5,
the grinds and just students. We are going to cover all sections
of the campus, from Arthur Hall, which is just about three clouds
from heaven, to Lagunita, Branner and the other outlying sections
of this campus.
However, it will be impossible to find every particle of de
sirable news, and if something just too, too thrilling has hap
pened to you and you know that everyone would love.to hear
about it, just be patient with us and if the trusty old hashers'
grapevine holds out it will ultimately wend its way into print,
if it is printable.
First, to catch up on a few events of the summer. Topping
the list are marriagesâ€”marriage, that wonderful institution for
couples who have decided that two can live as cheaply as one
and are determined to prove it to everyone including themselves.
Dave Brown, Zete, and Marsha Smith, Kappa, are now the
Browns, no relation to the St. Louis group. Virginia Soper and
Professor Kirby are now as one. Fran Harvey and Professor Sher

riffs have tied the nuptial knot. The latest is the marriage of Lois
Kruse, Pi Phi, to Bob Farrar, A.T.O.
Starting this guarter off with a bang, D.G.'s Peggy Allan and
Virginia Walker Wednesday night passed the traditional box of
chocolates, which announced their engagements to Godfrey
Gregg, Sigma Nu from Cal, and Pat Hillings, Delta Sigma Phi
from U.S.C., respectively.
Many of the prominent men on campus have moved into
houses off the Farm. Tink Wooley and Bob DeMott have con
fined themselves to a cell in Wagon Wheels and Ric Supple,
Ed Luce and Dick Driscoll are living on Skid Row. Only 27
rooms but they call it home.
A tip to the freshman men who are as yet undecided about
the reg dance. Do not walk in groups of less than four unless
accompanied by a beautiful babe. I understand that the ratio
is getting so tough that the gals are resorting to violence as the
only sure-fire method of getting dates.
