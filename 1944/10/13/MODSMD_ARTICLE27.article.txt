# Bull Session

### Dick Crane 
I haven't heard any vile names coming my way from the
Quad office in the last two'days, so I take it that my suggestion
was not followed, and that no one took enough interest in my
column to correspond with "Lochinvar" Hunter. It is just as well
that you didn't, as it was only a gag on my part anyway.
To move on to another topic, let us set the clock ahead two
days hence, and in a realm of fantasy, let us make believe that
it is 7:00 p.m. of Saturday next. Now with that being done very
easily, let us make a tour of the various girls' dorms, and the
sorâ€”(excuse, please) houses along the "Row." In the places
mentioned, the phones will be clanging madly, lights will be on
all over the house (which no doubt causes a slight feeling of
nausea to come over the Board of Trustees), and a hell of a lot
of noise and commotion all round these places we are visioning.
There will no doubt be heard a lot of talking, with the con
versation being something like this: "I didn't want to go with
the damn 'dope,' but you know how the manpower shortage is,"
or you might hear, "Who has a Quad? Some 'jerk' who said
that he met me at Dinah's one night wants me to go with him. I
was so 'fried' that I can't remember who he was, and I want to
look for his picture before I say yes."
Ah, yes! the freshman girls will be excited and nervous over
the whole thing, and very anxious to make a good impression
on the new date. They will probably say to themselves, "I must
appear nonchalant, bored, and very tired of the whole thing."
Also, they will think that in order to be an old-timer, they must
smoke packs of cigarettes and talk about Palm Springs. If that's
what you think, gals, you had better get smart, because from a
man's point of view it's a lot of hooey!
Then again, there is the upperclasswoman's viewpoint and
conversation which "is" to be bored, and with a passing remark
such as this, "Who has an extra suit of armor that I can borrow
this evening, as I have a date with one of the 8.M.0.C.'s on cam
pus, and 'Body and Soul' is his favorite song."
All of these things I have mentioned will no doubt give you
a true picture of the event taking place on Saturday evening at
9:00 o'clock. I want you all to know that I am-speaking only from
my conception of what happens, and not what actually takes
place. I certainly wish I could.
The gala affair I have been talking about is at the Women's
Gym, and will be known as the REG DANCE! So let's everyone
attend!
