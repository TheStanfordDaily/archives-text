This is the second article in the
Daily's articles introducing Stan
ford's new students.
"It's probably true that there aren't
traditions for freshmen women here
at Branner that there are at Roble,"
said Jacine Fragner of San Fran
cisco, "butwe know we can start
our own." That seems to be the
overwhelming expression of the 129
frosh and new sophomore women in
this historically "man's dorm," as ex
pressed by the girls interviewed by
the Daily.
Audrey Coll and Betty Gettle, a
couple of roommates, were ready to
berate the Daily for an article on
Roble as the home of frosh women
and made sly references that a
"'friendly rivalry" would not be un
welcome.

Certain
Branner's president, Barbara
Lamb, said the sponsors at Branner
agreed that they had met the "most
enthusiastic bunch" of kids they've
ever known.
Strolling frosh around the corri
dors were eager to speak approval of
the roomy, red-draped home and the
friendly inhabitants. It looks like
good food is going to be Branner's
chiefly heralded virtue; no one fails
to mention it with gratitude to the
dining room head. Mrs. Hamlin.
