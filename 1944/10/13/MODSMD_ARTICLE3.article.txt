# S.W.B. to Honor War Workers
## 
### 
Top honors for war work hours
will go the women's living groups
in which every member fulfills her
required two hours, work per week
pledge, Jaekie Cannon, chairman of
the War Work Committee, announced
yesterday.
Under the new work hours tabula
tion system the living groups will be
placed in three divisions: number
one, taking highest honors, to consist
of houses where each member has
done two hours of work or more;
the second division, groups which do
more than their pledged hours, but
whose work was done by only a few;
and third, those houses under 100%
in both tabulations.
A chart will be placed in the Cel
lar showing the results of each week.
Types of activities to be counted
toward the war work total will be
announced Monday, and pledge lists
will be handed out. In the meantime
the bandage rolling room is open for
those who wish to finish their work
hours early.
