Monogram's "Leave it to the Irish"
purports to be the second half of the
twin bill. James Dunn and a few
other "has-beens" struggle somehow

The Varsity Theater is currently
screening two Warner Brothers pic

"Make Your Own Bed," a comedy
mystery starring Jack Carson and

ney Greenstreet do their best but
can't overcome a interior story and
sloppy direction.â€”Dick Bower
