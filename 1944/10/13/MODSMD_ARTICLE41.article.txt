BILL TILDEN in 1920 became the
first Atherican to win the world's
championship at Wimbledon. For
five years thereafter he dominated
the tennis world, winning six straight
U.S. singles championships.
Tilden s_ final round victories over
"Little Bill" Johnston became an an
nual affair in the early '20's. For 10
consecutive years "Big Bill" was
ranked No. 1 in men's singles in the
United States, and for 11 straight
years he represented us in the Davis
Cup Challenge Rounds.
Recently Don Budge proposed a
series of questions on tennis greats
which Esquire Magazine put to hun
dreds of sports authorities through
out the country. Of those questioned,
88 per cent considered Tilden the
greatest male tennis player in his
tory. while 56 per cent considered
him the most spectacular.
Though he is now 51 years old,
"Big Bill" can still hold his own with
the best of them for a set or two.

FRANK KOVACS—tennis' "clown
prince." Frankie is famous for his
screwball stunts at crucial moments
in important matches. One of the
better known of these was his sit
down strike when playing Joe Hunt
at Forest Hills.
In a letter written to George Rogers
last week, Tilden describes Kovacs
as "a greatly improved player and
the equal of anyone in the world to
day, including Budge. I never en
joyed playing anyone more than 1
did Frank in New York."
Last year Kovacs visited Australia,
and on his trip down under beat the
best of the Australians who had
taken the .Davis Cup from America
in 1939, Bromwich and Quist.
Frankie is now stationed at the
Dibble Hospital in Menlo Park.

NOEL BROWN—an 18-year-old San
Diego junior, now in the Navy V-12
at Occidental College in Los An
geles. This will be his first public
appearance outside of some exhibi
tion matches played with Tilden in
thepast few weeks before members
of the armed forces.
Tilden has this to say of Noel
irown: "I consider him the most

promising junior in America—not
the best at the moment, but the
most promising in style fur a great
player."

VIRGINIA WOLFKNDEN KOVACS
—One of the prettiest of the higher
ranking female stars, Mrs. Kovacs
did very well in the eastern tourna
ments this year.
She proved herself a real fighter
in her quarter-final match against
Pauline Betz, the champion, at For
est Hills last month. She managed
to take a set from Pauline, some
thing which neither Louise Brough
nor Margaret Osborne were able to
do in the semi-final and final rounds.
