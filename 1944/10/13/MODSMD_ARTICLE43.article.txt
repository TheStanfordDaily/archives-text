(Editor's note.—This is the first

ten oti heads of departments.)
"The last survivor of a once-proud
race," Professor Arthur G. Kennedy
describes himself, referring to his
title, professor of English philology.
For English philology was a rare
subject, taught in few colleges and
looked upon with fear and trem
bling by members of the English
literature classcs. Here at Stanford
it remained a separate school for
only a brief time, then merged with
and disappeared into the English
1 iteratu re department.
Sole Survivor
It was not a course to be taken
lightly, and of the two men who
succeeded in receiving a Ph.D. in
philology here, Professor Kennedy
is the sole survivor.
Coming originally from the Black
Hills of South Dakota, he had his
earliest teaching experience at a
small academy in Nebraska where
he taught everything from the Bible
and botany to Greek and commercial
law.
Describes Early Classes
His earliest classes he describes as
a mixture of cowboys and cowgirls
with a sprinkling of Indians. Little
did he suspect then that he would
one day devote himself exclusively
to the Stanford Indians.
Now head of the entire English
department, he can look back at 32
years of service to Stanford. It was
in 1912 that he first came here to
earn his Ph.D., and he remained to
become instructor, assistant profes
sor, associate professor and finally
professor.
Recalls Former Days
"Stanford was quite different in
those days," he recalls. The school
was just beginning to recover from
the quake. The Chlrrh was a pile
of scaffolding, and there was no li
brary. What books there wt>re were
housed on the second floor of the
present Administration Building.
The Englsih department too had a
different home which was changed
only a few years ago to the Inner
Quad. It was located then at the
present History corner. But even
now the old name lingers, and dates
are still made for the "English cor
ner."
Dr. Kennedy's work has been de
manding, and has left him littde time
to take the sabbatical leaves to which
he is entitled. His last trip abroad

was in 1931, into a comparatively
peaceful Europe. But Germany he
recalls was poverty-stricken and de
pressed.
He was in Cologne the day that
they declared a bank holiday, freez
ing all funds in the banks. He tells,
too, of German tourists flooding Italy
to spend their money and Fascist
soldiers seen everywhere. But in
now-occupied Norway he remem
bers watching excavations of boats
in which ninth-century chieftains
had been buried.
But Dr. Kennedy is reluctant to
speak of his own personal achieve
ments. They are better recorded in
the not so retiring "Who's Who in
America." It has much to say of
books written and honorary societies
of which Professor A. G. Kennedy
is a member.
This is his last year of active serv
ice. After four years of heading the
English department, and many pre
vious years as acting head, Dr. Ken
nedy is planning to retire.
When asked what he planned to
do after retiring, Professor Ken
nedy immediately answered, "Work.''
He will then have the time for many
! things which his numerous duties
have so far prevented. Many of his
books need revising, and he plans to
j write at least one entirely new one.
• After that he may think of the rest
| and travel that he so much wants
; and deserves.
