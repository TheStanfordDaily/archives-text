# Golfers Hold First Meeting
## 
### 
While they talked thirteen girls
crawled happily across the golf green,
ruthlessly chopping down the weeds
in their way. The newly formed
Stanford Golf Club was having its
first meeting.
Argument was heated concerning
the virtues of a Tombstone tourna
ment or a Dubs and Duffer Tourna
ment, but the former won the day.
Next Thursday each member will
leave the first green armed with an
allotted number of strokes and a
stake to plant where her last ball
falls. The prize will go to the girl
planting her tombstone nearest the
eighteenth hole.
Obviously the tournament will not
be taken very seriously, but will
make extra golf hours gallop rather
than drag. And that is fche primary
purpose of this club, which is de
signed for girls who are either en
rolled in Intermediate Golf classes
or are eligible for them. Great skill
is not required, and beginners will
be eligible the moment they are pro
moted. It's organization will be simi
lar to the Tennis Club, with mem
bership absolutely voluntary.
Officers were elected at this first
meeting as follows: president, Mar
garet Meadowcroft; tournament
chairman, Vee Hickman; secretary
and publicity manager, Mary A 1
Smith; treasurer, Eleanor Brotinan,
and refreshment chairman, Barbara
Grey.
Already many prospective mem
bers can mark off an hour of prac
tice, for their hour of weeding
counted as full outside golf time. In
the future, their putting, too, will
be improved on a weed free green.
All women who are interested in
joining the Stanford Golf Club
should contact Margaret Meadow
croft, phone 9079.
