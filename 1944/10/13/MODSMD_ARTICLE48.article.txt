### GLORIA BROOKS 
Nestled in the choice spot of the campus this quarter, right behind Se
quoia Hall where are lodged some upperclass and graduate men, is Casa
Ventura, the home of 54 of the new frosh women.
Like the Robleites these girls are full of Stanford spirit and rarin' to get
into things; however they are a step ahead for they have unpacked .ill

their trunks, and everything is m
apple-pie orderâ€”well, almost.

Ventura has some very unique fea
tures, which other frosh will hear
about very soon if they haven't al
ready. First there's the barbecue pit,
a very neat one in a lovely little gar
den just waiting to provide an out
door barbecue supper, and the girls
are planning a number of suppers
out there in spite of rationing. Other
living groups may use the pit too, if
they ask Mrs. Hueneryager in ad
vance.
Then there's the Ventura garden, a
very lovely formal one complete with
rose beds and box hedges. And a
very familiar sight to Ventura girls
is Mr. Chipps, the postman who de
livers stacks of mail every day in the
box with the little red flag.
Mrs. Hueneryager who is the sister
of Miss Pat, the "Y' 'director, and is
serving as director of Ventura for
her second year, seemed to reflect the
enthusiasm of the girls as she spoke
of the homey atmosphere of her
house and the friendliness of the
girls, many of whom have requested
to be at Ventura. Originally housing
upper division women as well. Ven
tura has for the last two years been a
freshman house.
The girls jokingly call themselves
the "commuters" as they commute to
Lagunita for all their meals. Joining
their bicycle brigade is the director
herself, who rides a very good Eng
lish model.
There are four new sponsors in
Ventura this quarter: Yvonne Gil
bert, president, Louise Phillips, Jane
Irwin, and Jean Peal. Returning as
night assistant is Miss Dorothy
Schulz.
