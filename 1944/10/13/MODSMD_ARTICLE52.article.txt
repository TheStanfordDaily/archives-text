# Cellar Ranks High on Campus Popularity Roll
## 
### 
Ranking second only to the P.O. in the campus popularity poll, the
Stanford Cellar, located not on the top, but—you guessed it—on the bot
tom floor of the Union, has been the scene of Hot-chocolate parties, 11
o'clock English classes, and not-so-quiet little bridge games for more than
twenty years. The Cellar, Home of the 101, is staffed by such notables
as Mr. Strauss, assistant manager who has been mixing malts for 16 years

Charley the Bus Boy; and Louis, A
night watchman and head dish- ;
washer.
The hours that prevailed during |
spring quarter at the Cellar have '
fallen before dishwasher shortage; |
so that it is now open from 7:30 to
10:30 a.m.; 11:30 till 1:30 p.m.; and
beginning today, 3:30 to 7:00 in the
evening.
According to Miss Palmer, direc
tor of the Cellar, dishwashers are
needed particularly for the hours
between 12:00 and 1:30, and (5:00
to 8:00 p.m. Hashers are needed
for regular jobs between 9:00 and
10:30 in the morning. If and when
these positions have been filled,
the "basement" will again resume
its evening hours.
Store Carries Sundries
Displayed in the .store part of the
Cellar are shaving brushes, maga
zines, potato chips and the Stanford
Axe. (The last is not for sale.) Do
ing a thriving business as usual, the
store broke all records by having,
on Reg Day, 1,000 customers by 10:00
o'clock.
Among the prime attractions in
this quaint little store are the easy
chairs which are lined up at the far
side. These are often occupied by
students for sleeping purposes who
have not yet been assigned to rooms,
men waiting to get into the Cellar,
and workers who commute in the
daytime to Marin Shipyards.
Hashers Have Jargon
In attempting to get an "in" on
the Cellar's activities, we were in
formed that when the men in the
white coats (they're hashers) yell
"86" it means that some commodity
has been sold out, and when they cry
"echo" they want the hasher who
gave the order to repeat it.
Mr. Strauss, by virtue of 16 years
of observation, says that the kids
nowadays are "a swell bunch, more
congenial, and with a better attitude
than in previous years."
Some Students "Short"
High on the list of Cellar traditions
is the neat one where students get up
and walk out without paying their
checks .... a practice that amounts
to a loss of four dollars each day to
the Union.
Upon inquiring we found that dur
ing the rainy months hot chocolate
and hot fudge sundaes were the most
frequent orders, with fountain drinks
consistently popular. (As you may
discovered, hot fudge sundaes
are now listed as war casualties.)
The Cellar was originally (in 1923)
a cafeteria for freshmen men, but
was converted in '24 to an ice-cream
bar and remodeled in 1928. The back
room, haunt of card sharks, was
added in 1933.
