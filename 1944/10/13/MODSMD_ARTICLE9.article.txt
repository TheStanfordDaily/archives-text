U.S. PACIFIC FLEET HQ.. PEARL HARBOR, Oct. 12 (UP).â€”
Tokyo said today that one thousand American carrier planes had
attacked Formosa, the great Japanese military and naval base
which lies off the China coast in a key position southwest of
the enemy homeland and north of the Philippines.
Confirmation of the broadcast enemy report would mean
that for the third time in four days Halsey's planes of the third
fleet had struck a body blow at the Japanese defense system.
Admiral Nimitz, Pacific Fleet commander, had announced two
attacks on Marcus Island, 1350 miles southeast of Tokyo, Sunday,
and on the Ryukyu Islands between Japanese and Formosa
Monday.
But the Formosa raids, as the Japanese described it, over
shaadowed the others because it was made on one of the greatest
military and naval bases of the Japanese defense setup.
