## 
### 
One war year after his first speech in October of 1943 as president of J
Stanford University. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder again welcomed students j
in an assembly Friday morning at which General R. S. Chavin presented j
the University with the Ordnance Distinguished Service Award for "out
standing and meritorious contributions in war and in peace."
Dr. Tresidder introduced General Chavin, saying, "It is with a sense of j

pride that we merit his coming here."'*
On behalf of the University, Arthur
B. Dolnonoske. professor of engi
neering, accepted the large red cer- j
tificate embossed with the Ordnance j
seal.
Stanford Sets Pace
"Your university has set the pace j
for other universities and colleges," ;
General Chavin said, referring to
Stanford's peacetime training as j
helping the progress of the war. j
"The Gage Laboratory saved months
even years—to say nothing of lives— j
we owe Stanford University a heavy
debt of gratitude."
The district Gage Laboratory was j
established in 1929 to develop pre- !
cision gages, and during war years 1
these instruments have been used to i
facilitate the manufacture of war '
materiel. Speaking as the army's j
representative, General Chavin con- [
eluded by remarking that "if all |
others were as good, our tribula- j
tions would have been reduced. The j
object of my mission is to repay !
Stanford for fourteen successful j
years. These years could only be j
measured by one standard, he added, !
"the saving of lives."
Tresidder Scores a Laugh
Following the ceremony, Dr. Tres
idder walked to the platform and be- j

"Women": at which the coeds who !
) jammed the auditorium roared. In
cluding the men students in his in- j
formal talk, the President added, '
"What a change from a year ago!" |
'Victory Brings Questions'
"We now have our full power . . .
victory is assured and in the near !
future," he said. But, he warned, I
victory will raise new questions |
which must be answed.
"Now soldiers from Dibble Hos- .
pital we pick up along the roads tell J
us the same old story we heard after j
the last war. All they want to do is j
to get back to normal life."
Muffed First Chance
"We had an opportunity before to I
assume world leadership. My gener- j
ation muffed it . . . now we are re
armed for a second time. A thought- |
ful person sees familiar figures j
emerging from the gloom. There's j
no real reason to suppose that we
