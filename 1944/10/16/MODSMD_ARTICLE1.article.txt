# Award, Tresidder's Speech Highlights Of Student Assembly
## 
### 
One war year after his first speech in October of 1943 as president of J
Stanford University. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder again welcomed students j
in an assembly Friday morning at which General R. S. Chavin presented j
the University with the Ordnance Distinguished Service Award for "out
standing and meritorious contributions in war and in peace."
Dr. Tresidder introduced General Chavin, saying, "It is with a sense of j

pride that we merit his coming here."'*
On behalf of the University, Arthur
B. Dolnonoske. professor of engi
neering, accepted the large red cer- j
tificate embossed with the Ordnance j
seal.
Stanford Sets Pace
"Your university has set the pace j
for other universities and colleges," ;
General Chavin said, referring to
Stanford's peacetime training as j
helping the progress of the war. j
"The Gage Laboratory saved months
even years—to say nothing of lives— j
we owe Stanford University a heavy
debt of gratitude."
The district Gage Laboratory was j
established in 1929 to develop pre- !
cision gages, and during war years 1
these instruments have been used to i
facilitate the manufacture of war '
materiel. Speaking as the army's j
representative, General Chavin con- [
eluded by remarking that "if all |
others were as good, our tribula- j
tions would have been reduced. The j
object of my mission is to repay !
Stanford for fourteen successful j
years. These years could only be j
measured by one standard, he added, !
"the saving of lives."
Tresidder Scores a Laugh
Following the ceremony, Dr. Tres
idder walked to the platform and be- j
gan his address with a determined I
"Women": at which the coeds who !
) jammed the auditorium roared. In
cluding the men students in his in- j
formal talk, the President added, '
"What a change from a year ago!" |
'Victory Brings Questions'
"We now have our full power . . .
victory is assured and in the near !
future," he said. But, he warned, I
victory will raise new questions |
which must be answed.
"Now soldiers from Dibble Hos- .
pital we pick up along the roads tell J
us the same old story we heard after j
the last war. All they want to do is j
to get back to normal life."
Muffed First Chance
"We had an opportunity before to I
assume world leadership. My gener- j
ation muffed it . . . now we are re
armed for a second time. A thought- |
ful person sees familiar figures j
emerging from the gloom. There's j
no real reason to suppose that we
will all live happily ever after."
"Life has become so intolerable
for great masses of the people in the
past, that they turned to one of two
things. In the Middle Ages some
turned back to a recollection of the
past, while in recent years we have
dreamt of an Utopian future."
Facts to lie Faced
"Neither has proven successful . . .
we hate to face facts. One of our
greatest perils is in not facing the
peril in time," he added. "Although
great sections of the world were de
stroyed in the first World War, and
an even more difficult problem is
now our own country, unable to
overcome its problems. What an
opportunity for leadership," Dr.
Tresidder commented, "in coming
to a general understanding."
Returning to his best-known theme
that youth is the backbone of the
country's future, Dr. Tresidder told
the student audience that he would
want from a college career if he
could "do it all over again."
What About College?
"The first thing I would want," he
said, "would be the ability to read,
write, and speak ... to be under
stood by those around me." He be
lieves this to be basic for all people
living in a democracy. Second, a
thorough grounding in mathematics,
"so that I would be able to unlock
the secrets of science."
A working knowledge of the sci
ences, and an understanding of the
history of man Dr. Tresidder con
siders valuable for any generation.
"And I would want some special
skill," he said, "for in 1940 92 per
cent of the men college graduates
were employed."
Democracy's Workings
"I would want to know about the
workings of democracy from the be
ginning," Dr. Tresidder said, and
added that he would attempt to learn
part of this from active participa
tion in student government. He en
dorsed sports and leisure activities
such as collections of rare books or
records, then stated that "above all,
I would try to learn how to along
with men and women," for lessons
learned in a small community hold
true when applied in larger societies.
Summing up his thoughtful ap
praisal of a student's place in the
world today, Dr. Tresidder cautioned
his audience to remember that this
was not the first crisis that the coun
try has faced and, the great leaders,
like Lincoln never lost their confi
dence in people. If we do not lost
our confidence in man's instinctive
desire to do right, he added, we may
"walk calmly through to good."
'Dare to Think'
Quoting Mrs. Leland Stanford, Dr.
Tresidder said, " 'Let us not be afraid
to outgrow old thoughts and ways,
but dare to think on new lines to
the future of the work under our
care.' "
"We look to you to prove for all
the guardianship of men and women
who have striven to be free through
out the whole history of man," Dr.
Tresidder stated in conclusion.
The program closed with the as
sembly standing to sing the Univer
sity hymn, "Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
under the direction of Warren D
Allen and accompanied by the Stan
ford Band. Yells and songs during
the hour were led by Ric Supple and
Dr. Allen.

'Victory Brings Questions'
"We now have our full power . . .
victory is assured and in the near !
future," he said. But, he warned, I
victory will raise new questions |
which must be answed.
"Now soldiers from Dibble Hos- .
pital we pick up along the roads tell J
us the same old story we heard after j
the last war. All they want to do is j
to get back to normal life."
Muffed First Chance
"We had an opportunity before to I
assume world leadership. My gener- j
ation muffed it . . . now we are re
armed for a second time. A thought- |
ful person sees familiar figures j
emerging from the gloom. There's j
no real reason to suppose that we
will all live happily ever after."
"Life has become so intolerable
for great masses of the people in the
past, that they turned to one of two
things. In the Middle Ages some
turned back to a recollection of the
past, while in recent years we have
dreamt of an Utopian future."
Facts to lie Faced
"Neither has proven successful . . .
we hate to face facts. One of our
greatest perils is in not facing the
peril in time," he added. "Although
great sections of the world were de
stroyed in the first World War, and
an even more difficult problem is
now our own country, unable to
overcome its problems. What an
opportunity for leadership," Dr.
Tresidder commented, "in coming
to a general understanding."
Returning to his best-known theme
that youth is the backbone of the
country's future, Dr. Tresidder told
the student audience that he would
want from a college career if he
could "do it all over again."
What About College?
"The first thing I would want," he
said, "would be the ability to read,
write, and speak ... to be under
stood by those around me." He be
lieves this to be basic for all people
living in a democracy. Second, a
thorough grounding in mathematics,
"so that I would be able to unlock
the secrets of science."
A working knowledge of the sci
ences, and an understanding of the
history of man Dr. Tresidder con
siders valuable for any generation.
"And I would want some special
skill," he said, "for in 1940 92 per
cent of the men college graduates
were employed."
Democracy's Workings
"I would want to know about the
workings of democracy from the be
ginning," Dr. Tresidder said, and
added that he would attempt to learn
part of this from active participa
tion in student government. He en
dorsed sports and leisure activities
such as collections of rare books or
records, then stated that "above all,
I would try to learn how to along
with men and women," for lessons
learned in a small community hold
true when applied in larger societies.
Summing up his thoughtful ap
praisal of a student's place in the
world today, Dr. Tresidder cautioned
his audience to remember that this
was not the first crisis that the coun
try has faced and, the great leaders,
like Lincoln never lost their confi
dence in people. If we do not lost
our confidence in man's instinctive
desire to do right, he added, we may
"walk calmly through to good."
'Dare to Think'
Quoting Mrs. Leland Stanford, Dr.
Tresidder said, " 'Let us not be afraid
to outgrow old thoughts and ways,
but dare to think on new lines to
the future of the work under our
care.' "
"We look to you to prove for all
the guardianship of men and women
who have striven to be free through
out the whole history of man," Dr.
Tresidder stated in conclusion.
The program closed with the as
sembly standing to sing the Univer
sity hymn, "Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
under the direction of Warren D
Allen and accompanied by the Stan
ford Band. Yells and songs during
the hour were led by Ric Supple and
Dr. Allen.
One war year after his first speech in October of 1943 as president of J
Stanford University. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder again welcomed students j
in an assembly Friday morning at which General R. S. Chavin presented j
the University with the Ordnance Distinguished Service Award for "out
standing and meritorious contributions in war and in peace."
Dr. Tresidder introduced General Chavin, saying, "It is with a sense of j

"Your university has set the pace j

General Chavin said, referring to
Stanford's peacetime training as j

"The Gage Laboratory saved months

we owe Stanford University a heavy
debt of gratitude."
The district Gage Laboratory was j
established in 1929 to develop pre- !
cision gages, and during war years 1
these instruments have been used to i
facilitate the manufacture of war '
materiel. Speaking as the army's j
representative, General Chavin con- [
eluded by remarking that "if all |
others were as good, our tribula- j
tions would have been reduced. The j
object of my mission is to repay !
Stanford for fourteen successful j
years. These years could only be j
measured by one standard, he added, !

Democracy's Workings
"I would want to know about the
workings of democracy from the be

added that he would attempt to learn
part of this from active participa

dorsed sports and leisure activities
such as collections of rare books or

learned in a small community hold

Summing up his thoughtful ap
praisal of a student's place in the
world today, Dr. Tresidder cautioned
his audience to remember that this
was not the first crisis that the coun

"We look to you to prove for all
the guardianship of men and women

One war year after his first speech in October of 1943 as president of J
Stanford University. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder again welcomed students j
in an assembly Friday morning at which General R. S. Chavin presented j
the University with the Ordnance Distinguished Service Award for "out
standing and meritorious contributions in war and in peace."
Dr. Tresidder introduced General Chavin, saying, "It is with a sense of j

pride that we merit his coming here."'*
On behalf of the University, Arthur
B. Dolnonoske. professor of engi
neering, accepted the large red cer- j
tificate embossed with the Ordnance j
seal.
Stanford Sets Pace
"Your university has set the pace j
for other universities and colleges," ;
General Chavin said, referring to
Stanford's peacetime training as j
helping the progress of the war. j
"The Gage Laboratory saved months
even years—to say nothing of lives— j
we owe Stanford University a heavy
debt of gratitude."
The district Gage Laboratory was j
established in 1929 to develop pre- !
cision gages, and during war years 1
these instruments have been used to i
facilitate the manufacture of war '
materiel. Speaking as the army's j
representative, General Chavin con- [
eluded by remarking that "if all |
others were as good, our tribula- j
tions would have been reduced. The j
object of my mission is to repay !
Stanford for fourteen successful j
years. These years could only be j
measured by one standard, he added, !

the future of the work under our
care.' "
"We look to you to prove for all
the guardianship of men and women
who have striven to be free through
out the whole history of man," Dr.
Tresidder stated in conclusion.
The program closed with the as
sembly standing to sing the Univer
sity hymn, "Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
under the direction of Warren D
Allen and accompanied by the Stan
ford Band. Yells and songs during
the hour were led by Ric Supple and
Dr. Allen.
One war year after his first speech in October of 1943 as president of J
Stanford University. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder again welcomed students j
in an assembly Friday morning at which General R. S. Chavin presented j
the University with the Ordnance Distinguished Service Award for "out
standing and meritorious contributions in war and in peace."
Dr. Tresidder introduced General Chavin, saying, "It is with a sense of j

pride that we merit his coming here."'*
On behalf of the University, Arthur
B. Dolnonoske. professor of engi
neering, accepted the large red cer- j
tificate embossed with the Ordnance j
seal.
Stanford Sets Pace
"Your university has set the pace j
for other universities and colleges," ;
General Chavin said, referring to
Stanford's peacetime training as j
helping the progress of the war. j
"The Gage Laboratory saved months
even years—to say nothing of lives— j
we owe Stanford University a heavy
debt of gratitude."
The district Gage Laboratory was j
established in 1929 to develop pre- !
cision gages, and during war years 1
these instruments have been used to i
facilitate the manufacture of war '
materiel. Speaking as the army's j
representative, General Chavin con- [
eluded by remarking that "if all |
others were as good, our tribula- j
tions would have been reduced. The j
object of my mission is to repay !
Stanford for fourteen successful j
years. These years could only be j
measured by one standard, he added, !
"the saving of lives."
Tresidder Scores a Laugh
Following the ceremony, Dr. Tres
idder walked to the platform and be- j
gan his address with a determined I
"Women": at which the coeds who !
) jammed the auditorium roared. In
cluding the men students in his in- j
formal talk, the President added, '
"What a change from a year ago!" |
'Victory Brings Questions'
"We now have our full power . . .
victory is assured and in the near !
future," he said. But, he warned, I
victory will raise new questions |
which must be answed.
"Now soldiers from Dibble Hos- .
pital we pick up along the roads tell J
us the same old story we heard after j
the last war. All they want to do is j
to get back to normal life."
Muffed First Chance
"We had an opportunity before to I
assume world leadership. My gener- j
ation muffed it . . . now we are re
armed for a second time. A thought- |
ful person sees familiar figures j
emerging from the gloom. There's j
no real reason to suppose that we
will all live happily ever after."
"Life has become so intolerable
for great masses of the people in the
past, that they turned to one of two
things. In the Middle Ages some
turned back to a recollection of the
past, while in recent years we have
dreamt of an Utopian future."
Facts to lie Faced
"Neither has proven successful . . .
we hate to face facts. One of our
greatest perils is in not facing the
peril in time," he added. "Although
great sections of the world were de
stroyed in the first World War, and
an even more difficult problem is
now our own country, unable to
overcome its problems. What an
opportunity for leadership," Dr.
Tresidder commented, "in coming
to a general understanding."
Returning to his best-known theme
that youth is the backbone of the
country's future, Dr. Tresidder told
the student audience that he would
want from a college career if he
could "do it all over again."
What About College?
"The first thing I would want," he
said, "would be the ability to read,
write, and speak ... to be under
stood by those around me." He be
lieves this to be basic for all people
living in a democracy. Second, a
thorough grounding in mathematics,
"so that I would be able to unlock
the secrets of science."
A working knowledge of the sci
ences, and an understanding of the
history of man Dr. Tresidder con
siders valuable for any generation.
"And I would want some special
skill," he said, "for in 1940 92 per
cent of the men college graduates
were employed."
Democracy's Workings
"I would want to know about the
workings of democracy from the be
ginning," Dr. Tresidder said, and
added that he would attempt to learn
part of this from active participa
tion in student government. He en
dorsed sports and leisure activities
such as collections of rare books or
records, then stated that "above all,
I would try to learn how to along
with men and women," for lessons
learned in a small community hold
true when applied in larger societies.
Summing up his thoughtful ap
praisal of a student's place in the
world today, Dr. Tresidder cautioned
his audience to remember that this
was not the first crisis that the coun
try has faced and, the great leaders,
like Lincoln never lost their confi
dence in people. If we do not lost
our confidence in man's instinctive
desire to do right, he added, we may
"walk calmly through to good."
'Dare to Think'
Quoting Mrs. Leland Stanford, Dr.
Tresidder said, " 'Let us not be afraid
to outgrow old thoughts and ways,
but dare to think on new lines to
the future of the work under our
care.' "
"We look to you to prove for all
the guardianship of men and women
who have striven to be free through
out the whole history of man," Dr.
Tresidder stated in conclusion.
The program closed with the as
sembly standing to sing the Univer
sity hymn, "Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
under the direction of Warren D
Allen and accompanied by the Stan
ford Band. Yells and songs during
the hour were led by Ric Supple and
Dr. Allen.
