# MUFFING IT

### 
Dr. Tresidder told us that a generation of Americans, his, had
muffed a chance to make advances toward minimizing war in
its lifetime.
A generation, ours, who in the birth of its thinking maturity,
has been hurled about physically and mentally by a graver repe
tition of the same struggle, faces the same probabilities today.
We are likely to do one of two wrong things; become so sick
ened of the physical brutality and tragedy that we close our
minds to the issues that recall war, or in our academic isolation
set goals too high for mortals and refuse to consider the inevi
tably compromised measures we can take. Most of us now at
Stanford will suffer from this last misfortune.
We must learn to realize we are only going to make some
small advance and great effort of mind and body is not too much
however small the advance. We can muff it with too high expec
tations as easily as with none. Giannini.
