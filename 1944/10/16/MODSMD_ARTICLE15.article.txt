# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
Today is Saturday, and I am writ
ing this column very early, so that j
the editor of this rag won't break out !
the bull-whip and gently remind me
that the deadline is 3:00 p.m. Sun- j
day. Yes, today is a beautiful Satur- |
day, and football fills the air. You j
can even smell the pigskin, or per
haps I'm too close to the Cellar.
As the Stanford stadium is no i
longer filled with the rousing cheers J
of rabid football fans, I just wanted to i
remind you all that they dy play a 1
3ort of football up BerHfley way, j
There are still Stanford men who !
play for Cal (although I wouldn't j
mention it to their face if I were
you), so my suggestion is, that you go !
up there and see them play sometime j
this quarter.
The whole incident was brought '
before me, when Davis remarked
that he had a couple of tickets for
today's game, and as he couldn't go
himself, he wanted to give them
away. It seems though, that he
couldn't even do that. What is the
matter with you people? I person
ally know of fellows who would give
a lot to see just one football game, j
but as they are overseas doing some
lighting, they are a little preoccupied
*t this time.
In closing this incident about foot
ball, I wish to let you know, that
not only would you be filling a seat j
'by proxy" for some fighting man j
>verseas, but also to remind you
hat we should show a little of the J
Stanford "spirit," by backing up our 1
ormer students, who are now giving
heir "all," so that Mr. Allison can
<eep his job. This is, as you know,
i tremendous undertaking for even
i Stanford man.
An experience took place in dear

old Cleveland Hall last week that
> I think would be of particular inter
j est to all people living in the various
; fraternity and sorority houses on
j campus, so I will relate before your
| eyes a little tale of woe.
| It seems that in the aforesaid
places, A T &T. Co. has installed pay
phones, which are generally used to
! call the folks for emergency funds,
! or to make or break dates with the
gals on campus. It also appears that
, our electrical engineers, facing a
I post-war depression, have decided to
| get a little practical experience by
! devising ingenious methods of evad
; ing the issue of depositing one "jit
| ney" to make a call.
One of the more prevalent meth
j ods is to use a pin and wire, al
j though I'm told that there are many
more ways to accomplish this das
tardly thing. To go on with the story,
this "chiseling" has gone on for so
many quarters that it was common
practice, and everyone was so used
to doing this, that a righteous feeling
of indigation arose when at times a
nickel was necessary to use the
phone.
Finally, this form of college econ
omy caught up with us at Cleveland,
and at this time we are without a
phone, although I have been in
formed that we will got it back if we
mortgage our souls. What we didn't
know was. that it wasn't A.TAT. that
j was getting beat, but the University
i itself! and you know how touchy
J they are about such things.
I know that it is galling as hell to
have to pay to use a pay phone, it's
almost too much to endure, but be
ing without a phone is also kind of
tough, so I will close for today by
quoting. "A word to the wise is suf
ficient."
