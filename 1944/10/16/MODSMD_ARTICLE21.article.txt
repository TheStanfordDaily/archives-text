### JIM WEINBERG 
Frank Kovacs defeated Bill Til
den in three sets, 6-1, 4-6. 0-7. in
the feature match of the lied Cross
benefit tennis exhibition played
yesterday afternoon on the Stan
ford Varsity Courts.
Kovacs and Tilden provided plenty 1
of comedy and some flashes of fine
tennis for the entertainment of the
2,000 customers, the largest crowd ,
; ever to witness a tennis exhibition in
Palo Alto.
It was a victory of youth over \
age, with the outcome never very j
much in doubt. Kovacs took the 1
first set easily, winning six straight
games after Tilden had held serv
ice in the first game.
Neither man could hold his own i
service in the first three games of the i
second set. Tilden finally managed I
to do so in the fourth game, to lead
3-1, and he went on to win the set, i
3-4.
; Kovacs Leads, 5-0
In the final set, Kovacs ran up a i
5-0 lead. Tilden had been making j
I quite a few errors, especially on his j
forehand, up to this point. The "old |
J man" steadied here, and provided |
I some beautiful tennis as he brought j
: the score up to 5-all. He made a J
large unmber of service aces, and
i won several points on drop shots.
After Tilden had tied the match
up at 5-all, games followed service
until the sixteenth game, when Ko
vacs broke through Tilden's serv- j
ice to win the set and the match on
a perfect placement down the side
line.
Kovacs also proved the winner in j
j the exchange of comedy which ac- j
j companied the match. His best stunt J
; came in the third set, when, after |
volleying a ball into the net, he pro- i
ceeded to drop-kick it clear over the i
! fence on the other side of the net. \
"Well, at least I converted the extra :
' point," he quipped.
Mixed Doubles
In the mixed doubles match which j
followed the Tilden-Kovacs en- j
counter, Kovacs took Tilden's place j
| and teamed with Mrs. Patricia Can- {
ning Todd to defeat Mrs. Virginia j
I Wolfenden Kovacs and Howard Kin- 1
i sey, 6-2.
The highlight' of the mixed
l doubles was the play of Mrs. Ko
! vacs, who displayed the same fine
form (and incidentally, the same
I green sweater) that was so eflec- \
! live at Forest Hills last month.
Herbie Suhr came through with a j
6-4 victory over Matt Murphy, Jr., j
in the opening match of the day.
Suhr had point-match nine times in
the final game, in which the score
went to deuce eight times.
Tilden turned auctioneer between
matches, and managed to get $500
for the Red Cross for a racket auto
graphed by himself and several i
other tennis greats, including Ko- .
' vacs and Don Budge.
