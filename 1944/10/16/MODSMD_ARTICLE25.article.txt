# Kerosene Lamps Made Art Gallery Possible
## 
### 
Kerosene lamps, wicks, and chimneys; if it had not been for just such !
things as these Stanford, might never have been the possessor of the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery.
In early California days, Thomas Stanford, brother of Leland Stanford, !
conceived the idea of shipping kerosene lamps and other supplies from I

Australia to California where these *
materials were badly needed. The '
idea was welcomed by the residents j
of this state, and the transactions j
were profitable for Stanford.
Stanford" Nearly Hung
However, at one time an incident
occurred which treatened the suc
cess of the entire procedure. The
delay in the arrival of a ship carry
ing some item necessary to the use
of the lamps, enraged the Califor
nians and caused them to doubt
Stanford's motives, at which time
they threatened to hang him from j
the nearest tree. The well-timed ar
rival of the ship saved Stanford
from lynching.
Later, business affairs made it j
necessary for Stanford to travel to ,
Australia, where he remained. It j
seems that Stanford suffered an ex- I
treme case of mal de mer on the voy- I
age and abhored the idea of repeat- |
ing the exprience.
Collects Australian Scenes
In Australia Stanford became in
terested in the country itself and J
began a collection of paintings of the
Australian scenes by English paint
ers. He went so far as to employ a
man named Curtiss as permanent
member of his staff. When Stanford
saw a scene that particularly im- j
pressed him, it was Curtiss' job to |
paint it.
Some time later, it Was decided j
that the Stanford collection should
be exhibited at the Stanford Mu- ,
seum. The plan to display the paint
ings in the wings of the Museum was 1
thwarted by the earthquake which
destroyed those parts of the building.
Stanford then decided that the
University should have an art gal- j
lery of its own where students could j
go to acquaint themselves with ob
jects d'art.
Pictures Sent Here
Construction was begun, but the I
beginning of World War I made it
impossible to ship the paintings from
Australia. When the dangers were
lessened, the pictures were sent and j
accordingly distributed throughout I
the campus, the most interesting 1
paintings going to the gallery.
In addition to the Stanford collec
tion. the Mortimer C. Leventritt col- ;
lection of Far Eastern and European
artists on exhibit, and from time to
time paintings by members of the j
student-body and faculty are pre- j
sented.

In early California days, Thomas Stanford, brother of Leland Stanford, !
conceived the idea of shipping kerosene lamps and other supplies from I

Australia to California where these *
materials were badly needed. The '
idea was welcomed by the residents j
of this state, and the transactions j
were profitable for Stanford.
Stanford" Nearly Hung
However, at one time an incident
occurred which treatened the suc
cess of the entire procedure. The
delay in the arrival of a ship carry
ing some item necessary to the use
of the lamps, enraged the Califor
nians and caused them to doubt
Stanford's motives, at which time
they threatened to hang him from j
the nearest tree. The well-timed ar
rival of the ship saved Stanford
from lynching.
Later, business affairs made it j
necessary for Stanford to travel to ,
Australia, where he remained. It j
seems that Stanford suffered an ex- I
treme case of mal de mer on the voy- I
age and abhored the idea of repeat- |
ing the exprience.
Collects Australian Scenes
In Australia Stanford became in
terested in the country itself and J
began a collection of paintings of the
Australian scenes by English paint
ers. He went so far as to employ a
man named Curtiss as permanent
member of his staff. When Stanford
saw a scene that particularly im- j
pressed him, it was Curtiss' job to |
paint it.
Some time later, it Was decided j
that the Stanford collection should
be exhibited at the Stanford Mu- ,
seum. The plan to display the paint
ings in the wings of the Museum was 1
thwarted by the earthquake which
destroyed those parts of the building.
Stanford then decided that the
University should have an art gal- j
lery of its own where students could j
go to acquaint themselves with ob
jects d'art.
Pictures Sent Here
Construction was begun, but the I
beginning of World War I made it
impossible to ship the paintings from
Australia. When the dangers were
lessened, the pictures were sent and j
accordingly distributed throughout I
the campus, the most interesting 1
