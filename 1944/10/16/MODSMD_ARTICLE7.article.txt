# No Football this Fall--But We Still Have the Gaieties
## 
### 
With each autumn quarter come quantities of new freshmen to swell
the Farm's population, falling leaves, grass in the lake, once upon a time
football, but alwavs The Gaieties. To those new to the ways of Stanford.
The Gaieties, is the big song and dance show that Ram's Head, Stanford's
honorary dramatic society, produces every year to give the students a
few laughs.
Until last year when football was shelved for the duration. The Gaieties

(then with the prefix ' Big Game") â™¦
j was always given in celebration of i
| thegrid meeting with the University
of California. Last year The Gaieties
j (minus the prefix) was given as a
' combined operation of the civilian
and soldier students and proved so
successful that a return engagement i
has been arranged for some Friday
dan Saturday night late in Novem
! ber.
The '44 Gaieties is now in the mak- !
ing and the call is being sent to all 1
j those talented people who have skits '
they want to write, songs they want
| to compose, or jokes they want to
make up to contact Peggy Fitts, the
director, or Justine Huking, dramatic
j manager, immediately. Miss Fitts
may be reached at P.A 2-2151 and
Miss Huking at her office in Room '
2 of the Old Union. All skits, spe
cialty acts, songs, and jokes sub
| mitted will be reviewed by the pro- |
duction staff, and, if accepted will ]
