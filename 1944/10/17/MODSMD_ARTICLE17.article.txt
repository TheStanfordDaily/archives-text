# Y.W.C.A. Starts Campaign Drive
## 
### 
Today marks the beginning of a
week-long membership drive of the
YWCA, with an all-time high goal
of 850 set by chairman Merriam
Margetts. When the 'Y' was organ
ized in 1892, membership was com
posed of 110 ''lady students and
teachers of the institution."
Last year's membership of 705 was
the greatest in the University's his
tory, but in view of the increase in
women's enrollment, Miss Margetts
has advanced the quota to 850. As
sisting her in the drive are Zeryne
Wood, co-chairman; Jean Stroud, in
charge of office supplies; and Pat
Whittemore, head of the collections;
plus 150 residence representatives.
Long Service
Its 52 years of existence make the
'Y' one of the oldest organizations
on campus, and one that has outlived
many other activity groups. The 'Y'
works effectively in co-operation
with the administration, with an ad
visory board, faculty wives, and Palo
Alto women.
Evidence of its pioneering spirit
are the many activities which the 'Y'
has founded which were later taken
over as University functions. On this
list are the sponsor system, a pro
gram in consumer education, peace
and-war discussions, and other war
activities such as knitting which have
been taken over by the War Board,
and the vocational guidance program
which has developed into Vocom.
Leadership Oppoi t unities
According to the Y's executive
secretary, Miss Pat, perhaps the most
valuable service the 'Y' performs on
campus is the opportunity it gives
for leadership, through work on com
mittees, interest groups, and the cab
inet. Furthermore, the 'Y' does not
stop with college, for many women
continue on a voluntary basis.
"The 'Y' actually prepares women,
through its social service, World
Affairs, and Race Relations groups,
for service in the community," said
Miss Pat.
