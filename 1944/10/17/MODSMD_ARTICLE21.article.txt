# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
This week will show the first organized attempt at unity and
recognition between the returning veterans of this war who are
now enrolled in school here, and other social and political fac
tions of our campus. A topic such as this you will undoubtedly
say, belongs to a news article rather than a column like "Bull
Session," however this subject is important to me because I
happen to be a veteran myself, so I hope you will bear with me
for a few lines today, while I make the topic deadly serious in
stead of the usual attempt at humor. Anyway, perhaps the only
remuneration for writing this column is the fact that I can write
about anything I like.
The latest figures bring the enrollment of veterans to about
seventy-five, with the number increasing very rapidly as the
quarters go by. These men, many of whom have been through
the horrors of mortal combat, are facing a serious situation in
the problem of returning to civilian life. Many of them are much
older than the average student, and some of them are under
definite physical handicaps of which they are extremely self
conscious. Others have developed a sort of social inferiority
complex, and find it hard to go out and enjoy themselves in the
same way that the average civilian student here is able to do
without even thinking about it. All these things are part of the
difficult routine that each man has to go through.
In helping these fellows, the following things must be done:
First, treat him just as you would Joe Blow who has been with
you since freshman days. Although under a government con
trolled program, he is as much a Stanford student as you are,
in fact probably more so, because he has fought for the privi
lege of an education, which is one of the things we hold dear
to the American way of life. Secondly, he has undoubtedly ma
tured far beyond his years, so in helping him, teach him to grow
younger, and to be interested in the things that you do, because
that is what he will have to be accustomed to if he is going to
spend part of his life here. Lastly, let's make him a Stanford
"rough," and instill in him that part of the university, which in
due process of time becomes a part of all of us.
This group of men, will in the post-war period comprise a
majority of the students here, so I say let's get them interested
in student affairs so that there will be a foundation laid for the
coming veterans.
I am proud of the distinction of being the first veteran of
World War II to be enrolled at Stanford University, and the
"Stanford way" has been so thoroughly instilled in me, that I no
longer think of myself as a veteran going to this university, but
a Stanford man from the word "go." I know the rest of the
veterans attending school here can adjust themselves the same
way I did, if they get the help they are entitled to from all the
people who comprise the Stanford student body.

majority of the students here, so I say let's get them interested
in student affairs so that there will be a foundation laid for the
coming veterans.
I am proud of the distinction of being the first veteran of
World War II to be enrolled at Stanford University, and the
"Stanford way" has been so thoroughly instilled in me, that I no
longer think of myself as a veteran going to this university, but
a Stanford man from the word "go." I know the rest of the
veterans attending school here can adjust themselves the same
way I did, if they get the help they are entitled to from all the
people who comprise the Stanford student body.
This week will show the first organized attempt at unity and
recognition between the returning veterans of this war who are
now enrolled in school here, and other social and political fac
tions of our campus. A topic such as this you will undoubtedly
say, belongs to a news article rather than a column like "Bull
Session," however this subject is important to me because I
happen to be a veteran myself, so I hope you will bear with me
for a few lines today, while I make the topic deadly serious in
stead of the usual attempt at humor. Anyway, perhaps the only
remuneration for writing this column is the fact that I can write
about anything I like.
The latest figures bring the enrollment of veterans to about
seventy-five, with the number increasing very rapidly as the
quarters go by. These men, many of whom have been through
the horrors of mortal combat, are facing a serious situation in
the problem of returning to civilian life. Many of them are much
older than the average student, and some of them are under
definite physical handicaps of which they are extremely self
conscious. Others have developed a sort of social inferiority
complex, and find it hard to go out and enjoy themselves in the
same way that the average civilian student here is able to do
without even thinking about it. All these things are part of the
difficult routine that each man has to go through.
In helping these fellows, the following things must be done:
First, treat him just as you would Joe Blow who has been with
you since freshman days. Although under a government con
trolled program, he is as much a Stanford student as you are,
in fact probably more so, because he has fought for the privi
lege of an education, which is one of the things we hold dear
to the American way of life. Secondly, he has undoubtedly ma
tured far beyond his years, so in helping him, teach him to grow
younger, and to be interested in the things that you do, because
that is what he will have to be accustomed to if he is going to
spend part of his life here. Lastly, let's make him a Stanford
"rough," and instill in him that part of the university, which in
due process of time becomes a part of all of us.
This group of men, will in the post-war period comprise a
majority of the students here, so I say let's get them interested
in student affairs so that there will be a foundation laid for the
