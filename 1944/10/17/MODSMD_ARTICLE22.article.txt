The German resistance in the Bal- ;
kans is beginning to stiffen along a |
line running from Szeged, about !
fifty miles southeast of Budapest, to j
Belgrade, where Marshal Tito in
conjunction with Red Army units !
is trying to sieze the city before the j
Germans retreating from the south
can get through it. A violent and
confused tank battle is being fought '
U the former point, the Russians
rying to break through to Budapest. ;
The Hungarians, realizing the fu- j
ility of the battle from their stand- i
point, have surrendered, but the I
Germans, whose main interest is to :
ceep the flank of their line of re- i
reat up the Jugoslav coast as secure
is possible, have seized their capital,
ind are continuing the struggle.
A sizable portion of the vanguard
>112 the retreating German columns

must already bo clear of danger,
since, considering the scanty Ger
man reserves, these could be the
only source of strength large enough
for the enemy to make such a fierce
delaying action.
Future German Stand
The next German line of defense
might well be not far from their pres
ent one. A long river flows parallel
to the battlefront for about a hun
dred and forty miles until it joins
a north-south river, the Sava, about
94 miles from Belgrade. At Belgrade,
the Sava joins the Danube which
(lows northward to Budapest, where
it turns eastward. Thus the German
lines would be behind river barriers
except between Budapest and the
mountains on the northern border
of Czechoslovakia. The Russian cap
ture of Belgrade would channel them
into an advance between the Sava
and the Danube.
