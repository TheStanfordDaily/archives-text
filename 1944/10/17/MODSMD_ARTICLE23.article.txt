## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
"The largest turnout of instrumen
talists in years" marked the first
two meetings of (lie Stanford Band,
and contributed to the success of its
first performance at last Friday's
assembly, rated by all as "surpris
ingly good."
Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, conductor
of the band and associate professor
of music, revealed that a large per
centage of (he Band's 65 members
are army students, and that their
has been yuide possible
by the fine spirit of co-operation
shown by Colonel Eden in providing
many services such as sending trucks
for the transportation of instruments.
Soldiers Mustered Out
Credit for the turnout also should
go to Lieut. Runyon, band manager,
who has "mustered every available
soldier who can play a band instru
ment. Said Dr. Popper, "If we had
such Lieut. Kunyon's for the civilian
students too, I know the Stanford
Band could be one of the biggest
University bands in California.
"In spite of the size of the band
now, we need civilian students. Girls
areheartily welcomed in the band,
not only by the conductor and the
very able assistant director, Dick
Flint, but." said Dr. Popper with a
sly twinkle, "they are assured a
warm welcome by every soldier in
the band."
At present there are 15 civilian
students, but many more are needed,
especially saxaphone players. The
band is now studying Finlandia by
Sibelius, and meets Tuesday and
Thursday from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m.
New Orchestra
Another organization deserving
full student attention is the newly
formed Stanford Orchestra, contin
ued Dr. Popper. At the first meet
ing, 35 campus musicians, all stu
dents, turned out, but 55 or 60 mem
bers are needed to make this an
efficient organization which will con
tribute highly to the music life of
this campus.
Students who would like to join
the orchestra but do not feel that
they can spare the time are reminded
that the band requires but one hour
and 45 minutes each week, and that
this time is pleasantly spent.
Dr. Popper Conducts
The orchestra, conducted by Dr.
Popper, meets every Thursday night
at 7:15. Information concerning this
organization and its plans may be
obtained from Carol Person, orches
tra manager, or from Dr. Popper.
In encouraging students to join,
Dr. Popper pictured the thrill of be
ing able, not merely to listen to, but
to play symphonic music. "If I as a
student had the opportunity," he
said vehemently, "I would not hesi
tate."

talists in years" marked the first
two meetings of (lie Stanford Band,
and contributed to the success of its
first performance at last Friday's
assembly, rated by all as "surpris
ingly good."
Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, conductor
of the band and associate professor
of music, revealed that a large per
centage of (he Band's 65 members
are army students, and that their
has been yuide possible
by the fine spirit of co-operation
shown by Colonel Eden in providing
many services such as sending trucks
for the transportation of instruments.
Soldiers Mustered Out
Credit for the turnout also should
go to Lieut. Runyon, band manager,
who has "mustered every available
soldier who can play a band instru
ment. Said Dr. Popper, "If we had
such Lieut. Kunyon's for the civilian
students too, I know the Stanford
Band could be one of the biggest
University bands in California.
"In spite of the size of the band
now, we need civilian students. Girls
areheartily welcomed in the band,
not only by the conductor and the
very able assistant director, Dick
Flint, but." said Dr. Popper with a
sly twinkle, "they are assured a
warm welcome by every soldier in
the band."
At present there are 15 civilian
students, but many more are needed,
especially saxaphone players. The
band is now studying Finlandia by
Sibelius, and meets Tuesday and
Thursday from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m.
New Orchestra
Another organization deserving
full student attention is the newly
formed Stanford Orchestra, contin
ued Dr. Popper. At the first meet
ing, 35 campus musicians, all stu
dents, turned out, but 55 or 60 mem
bers are needed to make this an
efficient organization which will con
tribute highly to the music life of
this campus.
Students who would like to join
the orchestra but do not feel that
they can spare the time are reminded
that the band requires but one hour
and 45 minutes each week, and that
this time is pleasantly spent.
Dr. Popper Conducts
The orchestra, conducted by Dr.
Popper, meets every Thursday night
at 7:15. Information concerning this
organization and its plans may be
obtained from Carol Person, orches
tra manager, or from Dr. Popper.
In encouraging students to join,
Dr. Popper pictured the thrill of be
ing able, not merely to listen to, but
to play symphonic music. "If I as a
student had the opportunity," he
said vehemently, "I would not hesi
tate."
