# Hepburn Drops Glamour; Plays Slant-eyed Slayer

Stanford Theater.
M-G-M has given Pearl Buck's
j lengthy novel of China, "Dragon
J Seed." an expensive production that
at times assumes "epic" proportions.
The rather heterogeneous cast in
i eludes Katherine Hepburn, Walter
| Huston, and Turhan Bey.
For five reels or so "'Dragon Seed"
j is a sort of Chinese "One Man's Fam
ily," with the domestic troubles of
Ling Wan (Walter Huston) and his
; large family coming to the front.
Comes the Japanese thrust, however,
{ and the film develops into a somber
study of China's desperate struggle
against the invaders. Finally Kath
erine Hepburn as Jade emerges a
| heroine bj' disposing of scores of
: Japs.
"Dragon Seed" was made on

brown film, which is not so harsh on
fake make-up or scenery. Mr. Hus
ton turns in a finished performance
as Ling Wan while Katie Hepburn
has more than a little difficulty with
her lines. The picture is long and
rambling with several slow spots but
remains throughout a sincere effort.
The second feature is replaced by
a March of Time and a Donald Duck
cartoon. â€”Dick Bower
