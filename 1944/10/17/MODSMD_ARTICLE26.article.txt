Our high perch in Berkeley's Me
morial Stadium (no, not on Tight
wad Hill) gave us the chance to
watch College of Pacific drop a fight
ing 14-U game to California's Golden
Bears last Saturday afternoon. Yes
sir, those Bear tackles not only
ruined Pacific's Bob Mounter but re
sounded through Strawberry Can
yon itself.
"Stub' Allison's boys looked good,
mighty good— but don't let that score
fool you. Ancient Amos Alonzo
Stagg put up a game battle, one that
almost converted a blocked kick into
n touchdown late in the game, but
)l late enough to prevent Cal from
making that last-minute scoring
jaunt—32 yards to be exact.
Ilachtcn. Madigan Shine
Naturally, the Cal line sparkled.
Bill Hachten, Dick Madigan, and
Roger Harding stole the limelight,
but little Joe Stuart, Bear half, took
the cake. It was Stuart who darted
through the entire COP secondary
to score in the first quarter; it was
Stuart again in the last thirty sec
onds who broke through from the
fifty and lateralled to Dave Hirschler
on the 25 who carried it over.
There was more, too. In the sec
ond stanza, little Joe gathered in a
COP punt and returned it 4o yards
to the Pacific 5. Time and time again
he pulled us off the edge of the seat —
yes, he can really run.
Everything they say about Cal's
vicious tackling is true. On defense,
the Bears were terrific, playing
heads-up ball for 60 minutes. Yet it
was the same, typical California of
fense. T or not. At least it's been
sharpened to the point where it can
score when the chips are down—
something new for Cal.
Mounter Injured
Did the Tigers really fight? You
bet they did. With Charley Cooke
and Fred Klemenock running around
on crutches, and big Bob Mounter's
leg shattered on the second half

kickoff after a collision with Hard
ing, Pacific actually out-first downed
the Bears, 5-4. It was the same in
imitable Mr. Stagg, at 81 still the
master of the gridiron, still spry
enough to trot from the tunnel with
his youthful gridders. Mr. Stagg's
team played a spirited game. With
nothing more than Bill Turner, and
Bob Klein, huge tackles, and the will
to win, the Tigers did themselves
proud.
That pea-dinger attack, symbolic
of Stagg, was effective in one main
respect—good defense against punt
returns. Excepting Stuart's 43 yarder.
not once did the orange tacklers fail
to get their man.

the Bears, 5-4. It was the same in
imitable Mr. Stagg, at 81 still the
master of the gridiron, still spry
enough to trot from the tunnel with
his youthful gridders. Mr. Stagg's
team played a spirited game. With
nothing more than Bill Turner, and
Bob Klein, huge tackles, and the will
to win, the Tigers did themselves
proud.

Our high perch in Berkeley's Me
morial Stadium (no, not on Tight
wad Hill) gave us the chance to
watch College of Pacific drop a fight
ing 14-U game to California's Golden
Bears last Saturday afternoon. Yes
sir, those Bear tackles not only
ruined Pacific's Bob Mounter but re
sounded through Strawberry Can
yon itself.
"Stub' Allison's boys looked good,
mighty good— but don't let that score
fool you. Ancient Amos Alonzo
Stagg put up a game battle, one that
almost converted a blocked kick into
n touchdown late in the game, but
)l late enough to prevent Cal from
making that last-minute scoring
jaunt—32 yards to be exact.
Ilachtcn. Madigan Shine
Naturally, the Cal line sparkled.
Bill Hachten, Dick Madigan, and
Roger Harding stole the limelight,
but little Joe Stuart, Bear half, took
the cake. It was Stuart who darted
through the entire COP secondary
to score in the first quarter; it was
Stuart again in the last thirty sec
onds who broke through from the
fifty and lateralled to Dave Hirschler
on the 25 who carried it over.
There was more, too. In the sec
ond stanza, little Joe gathered in a
COP punt and returned it 4o yards
to the Pacific 5. Time and time again
he pulled us off the edge of the seat —
yes, he can really run.
Everything they say about Cal's
vicious tackling is true. On defense,
the Bears were terrific, playing
heads-up ball for 60 minutes. Yet it
was the same, typical California of
fense. T or not. At least it's been
sharpened to the point where it can
score when the chips are down—
something new for Cal.
Mounter Injured
