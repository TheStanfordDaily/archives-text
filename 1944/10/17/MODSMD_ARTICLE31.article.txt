# Shaughnessy, Pitt Slaughtered, 69-7
## 
### 
The Pittsburgh Panthers, docked
out in the traditional red and white
uniform of Clark Shaughnessy, suf
fered their worst defeat of all time,
Saturday, when a bruising Army
football eleven dumped them 69-7.
The Army boys scored in every
period, and held the Panthers score
less until the last quarter, when the
reserves were in. Felix Blanchard
and Bobby Dodds, brother of All â€”
American Glenn, paced the attack.
Shaughnessy, ex-Stanlord coach,
made no statement.
