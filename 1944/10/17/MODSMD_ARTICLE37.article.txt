"I suppose that the fact that I was born and raised in the country had
something to do with my interest in biological sciences," stated Dr. C. V.
Taylor. Dean of the Biology Department, in an interview with the Daily
yesterday."I have always had an innate interest in living things, and
wanted to know how they worked and what made them tick," he added.
Dr. Taylor has been at Stanford since 1925 when In* left the University

♦of California to assume his position of
Dean of Biology here. Since then, he
said, Stanford has gone far in the
field of biological research; the de
partment has undergone a gradual,
continuous, and wholesome growth,
both in its staff and in th» improve
! ment of its equipment.
j New Staff
The biology staff now here is en-
I tirely changed from the one when
i Dr. Taylor first arrived. "We have an
excellent staff." he added; "they are
first rate teachers who are leaders in
their special fields of research—some
even top in their fields."
The equipment, too, has under
gone tremendous improvement in the
last 19 years. "We have research labs
in the basement equipped for every
possible kind of research including
a room with constant temperature,
and facilities for optical and electri
cal experimentation. They rank with
' the very best," he said.

"I suppose that the fact that I was born and raised in the country had
something to do with my interest in biological sciences," stated Dr. C. V.
Taylor. Dean of the Biology Department, in an interview with the Daily
yesterday."I have always had an innate interest in living things, and
wanted to know how they worked and what made them tick," he added.
Dr. Taylor has been at Stanford since 1925 when In* left the University

♦of California to assume his position of
Dean of Biology here. Since then, he
said, Stanford has gone far in the
field of biological research; the de
partment has undergone a gradual,
continuous, and wholesome growth,
both in its staff and in th» improve
! ment of its equipment.
j New Staff
The biology staff now here is en-
I tirely changed from the one when
i Dr. Taylor first arrived. "We have an
excellent staff." he added; "they are
first rate teachers who are leaders in
their special fields of research—some
even top in their fields."
The equipment, too, has under
gone tremendous improvement in the
last 19 years. "We have research labs
in the basement equipped for every
possible kind of research including
a room with constant temperature,
and facilities for optical and electri
cal experimentation. They rank with
' the very best," he said.
Country Bred
Taylor was born and raised in the
country, first in northwest Missouri
| and later in Illinois where he re

College, "a small school that went
: out after the last war." He later
' came west and did further studying
at the University of California where
he received his degree as Doctor of
Philosophy. Following this he in
: structed and did research work at
various schools, including the Uni
versity of California, Johns Hopkins
University, and Hopkins Marine Sta
tion at Pacific Grove, California. He
was Dean of the School of Biological
Sciences at Berkeley prior to com
ing to Stanford.
Taylor lives in Palo Alto with his
wife and younger daughter and son
who attended Palo Alto High and
Jordan Junior High Schools respec
tively. Two older daughters have
completed their schooling; the eldest
