# JOIN THE 'Y'
## 
### 
The Stanford YWCA is one of the best-known organizations
on campus. Their many activities cover the interests of every
girl at Stanford. These activities offer girls many opportunities
including the chance to meet other students and faculty mem
bers and to attend lectures and discussions on current world,
national and local problems.
Every fall quarter the 'Y' holds a membership drive in an
attempt to register all girls wishing to show their interest in the
purpose of the 'Y' and financially support it. This year's drive
started yesterday and a donation of one dollar will cover the
year's membership fee?
You may go to meetings and lectures during the year even if
you don't pay a dollar for membership now, but your dollar is
needed to help the 'Y' operate during the year and to help pro
vide its advantages.
If 50 per cent of the girls on campus join the 'Y' now all the
expenses will be paid. Most of the living groups on campus
are trying to achieve a prefect record in this drive. Help your
residence to go 100 per cent.
