Hey Rube! Hey Rube! is the plaintive cry resounding from
over the Memorial Theater way, and to anyone not familiar with
circus talk, it means, Help! Help! The biggest show of the year
is in the making, and at this point they are short of everything
from actors and actresses to script writers and budding compos
ers of the future hit songs of the country. This show, appropri
ately called "Gaieties" is the short cut to success and fortune,
and so if people have been pointing to you with shame, have it
changed to fame, by joining the all-campus production of the
"Gaieties."
In order to familiarize you with the surroundings of the show,
let us take an imaginary trip backstage, and here is what you
will expect to see.
You will notice Janice Shaughnessy putting various people
through more weird gyrations than you have ever seen coming
out of Dinah's at closing time. You will see Jimmy High, going
through antics that would put Red Skelton to shame.
Incidentally, Jimmy is a "Gaieties" man of a few seasons back,
and has returned to school. Proceeding further, you will dodge
through flying paint brushes in hands of so many incompetent
people, that at first you wonder if it isn't the Painters Local of
the Corp. Yard brought in to decorate the theater, instead of the
scenery. There are noises heard, and epithets hurled that would
put a sorority meeting to shame, or make a marine sargeant
blush.
Finally, if you will look with a more practiced eye, you will
notice people moving about in various stages of dress and dis
array, so if you would like to become a member of the cast from
that angle, it's all right too.
This trip is now at an end, but before we depart, I just want
to remind all of you that have talent, or even think you have
some, to drop over to the Memorial Theater the first of next
veek, and have a tryout for the "Gaieties," because out of all
this infernal noise, will emerge a great show, and if you can
remember that you once took part in the "Gaieties," it will be
something for you to treasure all the rest of your life.
Laugh of the Day: The Quads are now on sale on the steps of
â™¦he P. 0., and after having a mighty poor morning in their sales,
'he people assigned to that post, left for lunch.
It seems that one of the fellows about campus, being rather
ired from climbing that long flight of steps leading to the P.O.
doors, decided to sit down and rest in one of the unused chairs,
and sold three of the damn things before he could get away.
At least I thought it was funny!)
