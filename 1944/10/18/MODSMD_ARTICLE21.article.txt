### Elliot Epsteen 
The naval duel in the Pacific might 1
vveli be approaching another and
perhaps its most decisive climax. !
The American Pacific Fleet is mov- I
ing dangerously close to Japanese
home waters, and is now operating i
in the area of concentration of the j
main enemy units. The events in
China might just possibly be thrust- j
ing our time schedule ahead of it- ;
self, but our power is so overwhelm- \
ing that this should not in the slight- l
est alter our chances of victory if a j
pitched battle should develop.
Considering the various Allied j
moves up to date, the previous strat- !
egy seemed to call for a strike j
against the economic roots of the !
Japanese empire co-ordinated with I
an amphibious move on the Philip- |
pines and Formosa, uncovering the |
enemy's maritime supply arteries, j
But the Japanese are forcing a crisis
by their progress in China, and it
thus appears that our strategy is
being altered somewhat to prevent it.
American Strategy
The strategy our present opera
tions might well be following, make
shift or long ago decided, is simple, '
like direct, and devastatingly blud
geonlike in its implications. It is
to get the Japanese into a battle, j
eliminate their navy, and assume
control of the whole Central Pacifib, '
moving on to the China coast. The
main problem is to get the enemy j
navy out. Shielded by the Philip
pines and Formosa, which undoubt
edly contain large forces of land ]
based aircraft, the Japanese High j
Command has been contented to j
stand pat for as long as possible. |
Feeling that a direct American at- i
tack could be turned into a Midway
in reverse, the enemy has felt more
or less secure.
Present Operations
Admiral Halsey is now approach
ing Formosa, and his previous air
blows at that island and Luzon were
probably aimed at knocking out not
only the air-fields on them, which
are the only important factor in fa
vor of the enemy, but his naval in- j

stallations as well. The raid con- !
ducted against the Riukius, danger
ous to invoke because of their prox- I
imity to Japan itself, was prob
ably a diversionary operation as was i
the Japanese thrust at the Aleutians
during the Midway campaign.
The only Japanese counters so far :
seem to have been some halfhearted
and costly blows with their air-arm, |
and, today, an abortive reconnais
sance by some enemy naval units
which drew back to the cover of
the main body upon sighting Ad
miral Halsey's fleet. Yet the Japa
nese can put up a slid' resistance if
they choose to.
China
But, as our eyes are glued on the i
coming naval operations, we must
not forget the importance of the
more slow moving and less dramatic i
land war in China. The Japanese
have swung inland from the Han
chow-Canton railway to invade j
Kwangsi province. Their capture of
this would give them two advantages.
First, it would link up their garri- ,
sons along the entire Chinese coast,
giving them control of all of it; and. j
second, it would give them a good
base lor a drive against Chungking.
Chungking is difficult to take be- |
cause it is protected from north, |
east, and west by a hors&hoe-shaped
belt of mountains. The Japanese |
have driven and broken their heads
against the sides of the horseshoe,
but now they will have a base to
climb up through the bottom.
