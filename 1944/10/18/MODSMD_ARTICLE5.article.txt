ALLIED SUPREME HDQ, PARIS, Wed., Oct. B—(UP)—British
tanks struck out three miles of the Dutch salient Tuesday in a
new drive toward German's Ruhr Valley while east of Aachen
the Germans dug in behind the torn West Wall on a "movable
winter line," hinged on the Ruhr River and a vast concentration
of tanks, reserves, and artillery.
The enemy remnant inside Aachen, supplied by air and by a
few trucks which survived a suicidal dash through the Ameri
can siege lines, lashed out in futile, Japanese-style, sorties from
their last pill boxes, setting the pattern for German last ditch
resistance.
