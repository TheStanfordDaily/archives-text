### 
The invitation to Stanford from the
University of California to attend
the USC game November 18 has been
formally accepted by ASSU Presi
dent Barbara White. Tickets have

been sent for and their arrival will
be announced in the Daily. They will
be on sale to members of the stu
dent body at the ASSU office upon
presentation of a student body card,
said Jim Emerson, ticket sales chair
man.
Following is the letter of invitation
sent to Stanford:
"After last year's successful col
laboration between California and
Stanford at the UCLA game, I want
to again extend to your student body
an invitation to join us in our foot
ball season.
Welcome at All Gaines
''While you are more than welcome
at any of the eight home games we
have scheduled, it seems to me that
the USC game on Nov. 18 would be
the most appropriate . . .
"Tickets would be half price plus
full tax or $1.40. If you feel that
there would be enough interest
among Stanford students to form a
rooting section, please let me know
and I will arrange to have a block of
tickets sent to you. As you know if
you came to last year's game, your
seats would be on the west side of
the stadium directly opposite the Cal
rooting section . . .
Rivalry May Be Upheld
'"This is probably the only way of
continuing the traditional California-
Stanford rivalry until the end of the
war. There are still a number of
ex-Stanford men now on our team—
for examples Bill Hachten, Ed An
derson, George Rasmussen and Dick
Madigan—and I feel sure that many
of your students would be glad to
come to watch them. Very sincerely
yours, Jean Elliott, ASUC Presi
dent."
Transportation facilities will be
worked out later and announced in
the Daily.
