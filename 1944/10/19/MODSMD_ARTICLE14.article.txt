# Our Hasher Sez:

### 
The ancient Stanford tradition, in which the hashers of the
respective houses, kiss the girls who are having birthdays has
been labeled childish and adolescent by certain of the living
groups. Some of the houses carry this old custom on with vigor
and enthusiasm and it is a source of merriment and enjoyment
to all concerned.
Not only to the hashers who are the BWOC but also to the
girls involved who the novel experience of being sur
rounded by six men all at once. Of course if the girls are go
ing to persist in their attitude it will be their loss for the hasher
is typically a strong, clean, goodlooking, but nice young man
(the hashers will love this last part) who is very much in de
mand on the campus. So here is to bigger and better birthdays,
enriched by the never to be forgotten labial ossilation of the
afore described hasher.
Golf is a fascinating game. In it Stanford students, men and
women, will follow a small white pellet countless thousands of
miles, when at home they won't walk down stairs for a cigarette.
They hack away at this ball with an iron rod, which would have
been better off donated to the scrap drive, and persist in digging
up somebody's freshly planted lawn. The men upon missing the
pellet cut loose with a long string of invectives, while the
women, who do not swear, merely fhink.
With the intramural football season just around the corner,
the Stanford rough is going into training. He is cutting down
on his bridge hours, playing now until one o'clock instead of
the usual three, being thrown out of the lobbies 'of Lagunita,
Roble, Branner, and the houses on the row three nights a week
instead of the usual five, cutting his liquid consumption from
quarts to stubbies and doing many other things which will
change him from a hulk to a hulk of a man. This is all the foot
ball the Farm is going to offer lads, so lets all support the pro
gram and get ready to do your all for dear old Sequoia, Toyon,
Arthur, Monroe, or some other dear old.
