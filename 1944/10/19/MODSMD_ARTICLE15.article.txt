# Bull Session

### Dick Crane 
Famous last words, 'I'll never play that damn game again,"
means that another session of the college students favorite
pastime has ended, and someone has lost the eguivalent of
five beers, or in monetary value, one dollar.
"Bridge," that insidious game, purely designed to haunt the
college man through four years. Classes are cut, friendships
are badly bent, monthly budgets are torn asunder, and in gen
eral more hell raised than the "Battle of Cassino."
On the campus, the game is played in the Cellar, the Boat
house, the Nitery, and if the faculty would take a suggestion,
the game might even be played in some of the lectures I have
attended, and one wouldn't miss very much. Off the campus,
students (?) take along packs of cards and play at "Dinah's,"
"Belts," "Carlins," and I am told that one of the Stanford
"roughs" once took a girl up Page Mill Road, and stopping the
car, suggested that they play a few rubbers of Honeymoon
Bridge.—l don't believe it do you?
"Who wants to make it a fourth," will echo at any time of
the day or night, and so let's follow up this desperate wail and
sit in on the game.
Now that we are true "kibitzers," listen attentively and the
following conversation will probably be heard: "Let's cut for
deal, the last time I had the misfortune to play with you, you
had the unmitigated gall to open with a 2 and 7 16 honor count,
when you know very well that Culbertson says 2 and 1 2 at
the very least."
Then the other says, "so what! that afternoon you tried to
finesse' everything but the house mother and didn't make one
vork."
The game goes on opce more, with each person playing as if
iheir last cent is on the game which it probably is—and so as
james Fitzpatrick of Traveltalks would say, "It is with saddened
nearts that we take leave of this land of terror and anxiety."—
Who knows? there might be a ficht.
