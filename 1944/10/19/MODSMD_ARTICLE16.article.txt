# WAR FRONTS

### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The Russians are driving into
East Prussia, the tempo of their Bal
kan offensive is being increased, and
recent reports have 1,000 Red tanks
massed before Warsaw. On the other
hand, General Mud has taken tenta
tive command of both armies on the
Western Front, and the enemy seems
to have thrown an effective cordon
around the breach in his lines at
â–  Aachen.
Thus yesterday's bulletin from the
j Germans, to the effect that the Ger
j mans are establishing a "movable
| winter line" and are ceasing their
' formerly desperate counterattacks to
i repair the split in their lines, be
j comes clear. The Nazis are probably
j again taking advantage of interior
I lines to shift divisions from the
, Rhineland to the East.
; Situation
| Thus the Allies might have an
! opening in the West, if they can sur-
I mount the adverse weather condi
| tions. The present operations, how
[ ever, are either non-existent or mi
! nor. However two actions, now in
| progress, are worth watching.
The first is the British drive in
j the North, designed to rob the Ger
! mans of their only opening, at the
thinly extended corridor that Gen
eral Dempsey drove to Nijmegen.
Canadian amphibious units have
' been operating against German gun
I positions on the islands of the
Cchlede estuary, blocking General
Dempsey's use of Antwerp for a
! short supply line direct from the
! British Isles, and the right wing of
t his corridor is pushing southeast
j towards the Ruhr, the anchor of the
I German line around Aachen. This
might be just a feeling out operation,
but, with a short line of reinforce
ment from Antwerp as a possibility
| in the offng, enough divisions might
I be sent to him from Britain for him
J to turn the enemy positions facing
j General Hodges.
; Vosges Mountains
The second is in the Vosges Moun
tains. Previously, the Sixth Army
! Group, operating there, had been
! the brunt of bitter but abortive
j counterattacks. Then they made a
twelve mile advance against spotty
opposition.
The Germans obviously used the
counterblows to cover the shifting
of troops, either to the north or to
the Eastern Front. An advance into
Germany from this sector is diffi
cult because an army trying it would
not only have to surmount the
mountains and the Rhine, but the
Black Forest behind the latter. In
addition, the lines have quieted down
now. so the Germans might have
j restored their situation. But a drive
from here might still be in the offing.
