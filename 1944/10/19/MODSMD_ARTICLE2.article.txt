# ASTU Dance Again Friday

### 
Playing once more for the all-cam
pus Friday dances, Jackie Herr and
the "Dabblers in Swing," will make
music tomorrow night from 8 to 11
in the Pavillion.
These ASC sponsored dances are
open to eveiyone on campus. Since
every dance is a tag dance, the af
fairs are no-date. Civilian men are
especially urged to come stag and
join in the evening's festivities, There
is no admission charge,' and free re
freshments will be served.
There are seventeen members in
the band, including three who double
as vocalists. They are all AST or
ASTR students, and most of them
also play in the regular Stanford
Band.
The Pavillion is made available to
the Army Student Council by the
University at a small cost, and this
expense is written otT by having the
army students clean up. The re
freshments are provided by the Palo
Alto chapter of the American Red
Cross.
The "Dabblers" donate their time
free of charge.
