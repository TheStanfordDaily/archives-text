'"The mission of the modern archi
tect is to raise the standard of dwell
ing of as many people as possible,"
said Jan Reiner in addressing the
audience at the regular Tuesday
Evening Series program this week.
Mr. Reiner, an internationally known
architect and designer, spoke on
"Architecture: Yesterday and To
morrow."
Whereas the architect of yesterday
planned monuments for kings and
gods, tomorrow's architect will plan
communities to house free people. In
the future we must plan whole com
munities, not just homes.
The style of architecture used k
a particular building is determine
by three factors. These are the times
in which the building is built, its
geographical location, and the ma
terials available.
There are six basic materials used
in building: steel (and other metals),
reinforced concrete, glass, wood,
stone, and plastic. Mr. Reiner dis
cussed each of these and showed its
importance in modern architecture.
The lecture was illustrated by lan
tern slides..
