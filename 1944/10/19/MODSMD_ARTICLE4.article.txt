# 'Y' Advantages Told Students By Secretary
## 
### 
Miss Patricia Davidson, executive j
secretary of the 'Y' released today ]
what she believed to be a cogent I
argument for joining the YWCA dur- .
ing its membership drive this week.
Mrs. Helene Heymans, present on j
campus last year as an in- I
structor in the Dutch language and i
now a member of the Dutch Women's j
Army, has written in a V-mail let- j
i ter from "somewhere overseas" that j
| her 'Y' membership card has brought :
j her many advantages, not only while I
!in training at Fort Oglethorpe, !
j Georgia, but also while overseas.
Mrs. Heymans recounted in her j
j letter that she had made many ;
j friends, been introduced into vari
j ous social and activity groups, and
j recieyed over-night accommodations
j through presenting her card,
j Ensign Idelle Sullens of the
! WAVES, recent visitor to the cam
! pus, has also written Miss "Pat" that
j her membership in the 'Y' has led
J her into many pleasant associations,
| especially during her training period
| at Fort Jackson, Mississippi.
The 'Y' Drive, at the completion
I of the second day, was reported slow
-1 ing down after the first day's splurge,
when six women's residences went
i 100 per cent. This year's quota, an
| all-time high of 850, requires the
! whole-hearted support of all living
! groups if it is to be filled.
Pat Whittemore, chairman of the
i collections, will report the results to
I Merriam Margetts at the close of the
| drive next Tuesday night. Also as
| sisting Miss Margetts with the or
ganization of the drive are Jean
I Stroud, in charge of office supplies.
! and Zeryne Wood, her co-chairman.
