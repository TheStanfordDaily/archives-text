# BACK THE WAR FUND
## 
### 
Monday the campus drive for the 1944 War Fund will begin,
under the co chairmanship of Charlie Clark and Joan McDon
ough.
The War Fund is one of the most important sources of finan
cial support available to many service organizations such as the
(JSO, United Seamen's Service, War Prisoner's Aid, and Allied
Relief and Refugee Aid.
We at Stanford, for example, have a special interest in giving
support to the War Prisoner's Aidâ€”about 40 Stanford men are
now prisoners of war.
As Governor Earl Warren has said, "The War Chest bolsters
fighting morale with direct services to our men in uniform,
strengthens the dauntless spirit of our Allies by supplying re
lief to their war-stricken peoples, and guards the families and
communities of our fighting men through health and welfare
agencies at home."
When.one of your fellow students appears for a contribution,
don't say, "tough"; dig in and help out.
