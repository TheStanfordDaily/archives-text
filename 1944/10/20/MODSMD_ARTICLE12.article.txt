# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
Do all you male students have huge flower bills? Have you
bought so many boxes of candy, that the sight of a gum drop
makes you nauseated? Have you bought so many cashmere
sweaters that you are running around in your shorts, because
you have no money to buy clothes for yourself? I thought so,
and should I make known to everyone the reason for all this
misery? It's "LOCKOUTS."
According to the Stanford Dictionary, the word "lockout"
means, "any female student who gets carried away by extra
curricular activities, and does not return to her cell in the al
lotted time, is temporarily relieved from the social problem."
This condition, usually being caused by the male species of
Stanford student appropriately called "rough" in this case—has
to be apologized for in some manner, so according to the tra
ditions of our fair campus, the "rough" has to send the problem
child candy, flowers, sweaters, or a morocco bound volume
of Bull Session, to keep her happy while scrubbing the floors of
her dormitory.
To get to the real point of the story, this situation has prevailed
here for guarters, years, and generations, but even more so,
since the ghastly hour of 1:30 a.m. was put into effect.
The general concensus of opinion on this subject by the stu
dents is too broad and varied to relate in one column besides
they wouldn't print it anyhow—but to give you the idea, the
whole thing is ridiculous.
Taking a lead from George Gallup, Davis and I took a poll of
the general student body, and found a unanimous assent for
the return of 2:30 Saturday leaves; so why not do what the ma
jority wants? The University of California for example has late
leaves for their coeds until 2:30 on weekends, and I
vish that someone would explain to me how in hell thpy get a
better deal than us in any department. This alone, is enough to
shatter one's morale.
I hope there will be some comment on this subject, as I don't
relish "batting my head against a stone wall." Any information
at all on this topic will be appreciated, and if any of you are in
terested, please send your correspondence to tins columnist,
care of Daily Shack, campus.

leaves for their coeds until 2:30 on weekends, and I
vish that someone would explain to me how in hell thpy get a
better deal than us in any department. This alone, is enough to
shatter one's morale.
I hope there will be some comment on this subject, as I don't
relish "batting my head against a stone wall." Any information
at all on this topic will be appreciated, and if any of you are in
terested, please send your correspondence to tins columnist,

Do all you male students have huge flower bills? Have you
bought so many boxes of candy, that the sight of a gum drop
makes you nauseated? Have you bought so many cashmere
sweaters that you are running around in your shorts, because
you have no money to buy clothes for yourself? I thought so,
and should I make known to everyone the reason for all this
misery? It's "LOCKOUTS."
According to the Stanford Dictionary, the word "lockout"
means, "any female student who gets carried away by extra
curricular activities, and does not return to her cell in the al
lotted time, is temporarily relieved from the social problem."
This condition, usually being caused by the male species of
Stanford student appropriately called "rough" in this case—has
to be apologized for in some manner, so according to the tra
ditions of our fair campus, the "rough" has to send the problem
child candy, flowers, sweaters, or a morocco bound volume
of Bull Session, to keep her happy while scrubbing the floors of
her dormitory.
To get to the real point of the story, this situation has prevailed
here for guarters, years, and generations, but even more so,
since the ghastly hour of 1:30 a.m. was put into effect.
The general concensus of opinion on this subject by the stu
dents is too broad and varied to relate in one column besides
they wouldn't print it anyhow—but to give you the idea, the
whole thing is ridiculous.
Taking a lead from George Gallup, Davis and I took a poll of
the general student body, and found a unanimous assent for
the return of 2:30 Saturday leaves; so why not do what the ma
jority wants? The University of California for example has late
leaves for their coeds until 2:30 on weekends, and I
vish that someone would explain to me how in hell thpy get a
better deal than us in any department. This alone, is enough to
shatter one's morale.
