# Our Hasher Says . . . by Joe Sher

### 
The day of the old-time house
raising is not dead, although in this
case it was a house painting. A
I group of energetic Stanford students
1 dressed in their best clothes, namely
levis, wended their way to Wagon
Wheels, where lies the luxurious
j manor of Tink Wooley and Bob De
| mott, which has just been christened
i Chintz Inn, due of course to the
j beautiful curtains in the window.
This happy group, consisting of
j Barbara's Porter, Brooks, and Van
| Colt, who were accompanied by
John Mathewson, Quincy "the Phan
| torn" Brown, and the genial hosts
{ Wooley and Demott, proceeded to
paint the Chintz Inn such an array of
i colors that the human eye has never
I witnessed a similar sight.
In the bustle of the evening two of
! the fellows were lost and their prog
! less has been marked by a series of
telegrams. It is indeed cheering to
i know that the Farm students stick
: together and the day of co-operative
, effort has not been lost.
Golf is a fascinating game (contin
; ued from la.st chapter), especially
when the little white pellet, which
i costs on the average 75 cents (enough
! for live stubbies), goes into the
[ rough. Here the energetic golfer
wades through a motley assortment
of long grass, gopher holes, cows, and
I various other matter which is lib—
j erally sprinkled over the course.
Upon emerging from the rough,
| the weary golfer proceeds upon his
j frustrated and unsuccessful way
j until he drops exhausted upon the
eighteenth hole.
Golfers such as B. J. Rucker, Mar-
I garet Meadowcroft, and Bob Ros
! burg swear that golf is the greatest
I game on earth, while countless thou
sands of others just swear.
They say that the greatest consola
| tion of golf is that it inevitably drives

j one to drink, although I can think of
i easier ways to get there, namely, by
I using a car.
There reaches us through the
! hashers' grapevine news of a titanic
| struggle. A football game between
i the hashers of the Kappa House and
] the D.G. abode.
Both teams are generously sprin
j kled with a powerful group of 4-F's
I and the game will probably be a
question of which team has the most
' substitutes, as there is a strong
j doubt in my mind whether any
| member of either team can last a
| whole game.

Excitement is running high in I oth
j houses and countless thousands c
j dollars are being wagered on the
| outcome. Odds on the game favo. -
the Kappa hashers, who are quote :
! as 55 to 54 favorites.
The game is to be played in the
I stadium and everyone is invited to
j attend. This is the opportunity of a
lifetime, for probably there will
' never again be assembled such a
I group. In fact, I am sure of it. for
; after the game the players are ad
! journing to their respective hospi
tals, and the Medical School has firs'.
! claim upon all the bodies.

Wheels, where lies the luxurious

This happy group, consisting of
j Barbara's Porter, Brooks, and Van

John Mathewson, Quincy "the Phan

{ Wooley and Demott, proceeded to
paint the Chintz Inn such an array of
i colors that the human eye has never
I witnessed a similar sight.
In the bustle of the evening two of

, effort has not been lost.
Golf is a fascinating game (contin
; ued from la.st chapter), especially
when the little white pellet, which
i costs on the average 75 cents (enough
! for live stubbies), goes into the
[ rough. Here the energetic golfer
wades through a motley assortment
of long grass, gopher holes, cows, and
I various other matter which is lib—
j erally sprinkled over the course.
Upon emerging from the rough,
| the weary golfer proceeds upon his
j frustrated and unsuccessful way
j until he drops exhausted upon the
eighteenth hole.
Golfers such as B. J. Rucker, Mar-
I garet Meadowcroft, and Bob Ros
! burg swear that golf is the greatest
I game on earth, while countless thou

j one to drink, although I can think of
i easier ways to get there, namely, by

There reaches us through the
! hashers' grapevine news of a titanic
| struggle. A football game between
i the hashers of the Kappa House and
] the D.G. abode.
Both teams are generously sprin
j kled with a powerful group of 4-F's
I and the game will probably be a
question of which team has the most
' substitutes, as there is a strong
j doubt in my mind whether any
| member of either team can last a
| whole game.

Excitement is running high in I oth
j houses and countless thousands c
j dollars are being wagered on the
| outcome. Odds on the game favo. -
the Kappa hashers, who are quote :
! as 55 to 54 favorites.
The game is to be played in the
I stadium and everyone is invited to
j attend. This is the opportunity of a
lifetime, for probably there will
' never again be assembled such a
I group. In fact, I am sure of it. for
; after the game the players are ad
