# Change Proposed for Pacific Coast Conference Grid Code
## 
### 
Stanford University went on record yesterday as favoring a revamping
112 the Pacific Coast Conference Football Code so that innocent students
will not be penalized for recruiting activities of which they had no part.
Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, University of California president said in
disapproval of the code, "The code must be revamped to eliminate penal-

ties that have sometimes been against
students who had committed no fault
Knd who were in no way responsible
for violations of rules."
The code was adopted at the sug
gestion of the late Edwin N. Ather
:on, Commissioner of the Pacific
Goast Conference, to curb anxious
alumni and universities from prose
lyting athletes.
In 1941 seven Stanford athletes,
K ter completing their freshman year,
vere declared ineligible for future
c ompetition at Stanford because they
vere illegally contacted or given
promises of aid at Stanford. Several
other universities in the Conference
were similarly affected, notably the
University of Oregon.
Dr. Alvin Eurich, vice-president of
Stanford, stated, "Stanford is in fa
vor of a revision of the Pacific Coast
Conference Code to meet conditions
not contemplated when the code was
; riginally drawn."
Alfred R. Masters, Stanford gen
eral manager of the athletic board
of control, said, "Those of us who
,'ave' been operating the Pacific
Coast Conference Athletic Code
know that under certain conditions
unjust penalties have been applied
1o s6me students. It is. therefore,
c bvious to me that the code needs
revamping."
The conference has a meeting
scheduled in November, and revision
