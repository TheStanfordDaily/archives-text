# Pep Section Formed For Cal-USC Game
## 
### 
Stanford history will repeat itself November 18, when the Farm student
body will again trek Berkeley-wards to form an all-Stanford rooting sec
tion at the Cal-USC football clash, recalling last autumn's migration ol
1,300 to the Memorial Stadium to watch Cal down UCLA 13 to 6.
Cardinals, who are handling arrangements for pre-game week, have an-

nounced that card stunts will be
performed between halves by the
Stanford rooters. Blossom Parke,
chairman of card stunts, urges all
Farmers who wish to contribute to
the art, ideas, or arrangements to
get in touch with her. Cards will
be supplied by Cal. "We want to
show Cal what card stunts are," said
Miss Parke, "so let's turn in plenty of
ideas."
Tickets Here Soon
Tickets are expected to arrive
early next week, according to Cardi
nal president Cheri Martin Ham
mond, and may be bought at the
ASSU office upon presentation of a
student body card. The Daily will
announce the arrival of tickets.
As Jean Elliott, Cal student body
president, said in her letter to Stan
ford prexy Barbara White, "This (the
game) is probably the only way of
continuing the traditional Stanford-
California rivalry until the end of
the war. There are still a number of

ex-Stanford men on our team, for
examples Bill Hachten, Ed Ander
son, George Rasmussen and Dick
Madigan, and I feel sure that many
of your students would be glad to
come watch them."
Indians on Team
The keynote of last year's game
rallies was the fact of Stanford men
playing on both (earns; at the game,
cheering was directed toward these
men rather than against Cal. Tlic
Supple, cheer leader, will direct as
he did last year.
Cal, as yet undefeated, welcomes
Stanford students to all its games,
according to Miss Elliott, but it is
hoped by Cardinals that the turnout
for the game with USC will be large
as our participation can make this
the biggest all-campus affair of au
tumn quarter.
