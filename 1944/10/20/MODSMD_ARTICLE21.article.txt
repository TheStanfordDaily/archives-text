# Murals Start In Two Weeks
## 
### MORT COHEN 
With intramural sports going into
high gear, Coach Elwyn Bugge, act
ing head of intramural sports, stated
that the six-man football league will
probably start in two weeks. As yet,
the rules have not been made, but
the committee on intramural sports
has decided that one-hand touch
football will be much safer.
It is also in favor of using 60-yard
fields as was done last year; they
make the game faster.
Definite rules will be posted after
the managers' meeting Thursday.
Coach Bugge desires that the man
agers for the various teams "get on
the ball," for Tuesday is the last
day for signing up. Referees will
probably be provided by the intra
mural staff.
Last year, cross-wise fields or re
gotation gridirons were used. That !
is to say, there were three fields to
one regulation field. Altogether, the
four practice fields, the sunken dia
mond, and the stadium were played
en.
It was also up to the individual
teams to decide whether first downs
at mid-strips were to be used. Con
versions were not attempted.
The games were 40 minutes long, j
with 20-minute halves and a five
minute intermission between halves.
Tie games were played off in an
overtime period.
There will undoubtedly be fewer
teams this year, owing to the great
reduction in the number of Army
students. The committee considered
using full-length football fields be
cause of the smaller number of
teams, but Coach Bugge does not
favor the suggestion because such
fields are not geared to the type of
piay in the six-man game. It would
detract from the game.
All bona fide campus organizations
are welcome to compete, Army and
civilian alike. As yet only six teams
have signed up.
