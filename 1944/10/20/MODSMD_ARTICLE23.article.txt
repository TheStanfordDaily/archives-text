Ah me, here it is autumn again.
Bright sunshine, fields of golden
brown, falling leaves, and with it
falling averages as the Daily's staff
of "experts" goes-into action again to
predict the top football games of the
nation each week-end. The current
gang of Steve Brodies consists of the
following experts: (Chairman) Jim
Weinberg, Daily sports editor; Bar
ney Gugel, an old-timer returning
for more; Gordon Levy, Mort Cohen,
and yours truly, "Bilge" Adams.
Getting right down to business, this
formidable array, after much argu
ment, discussion, coin-tossing, and
several pipes of choicest imported
and domestic opium, came to some
very definite conclusions concerning
this week's grid menu. Here they
are, and if you don't like 'em don't
brain us till after the game.
March Field over El Toro Marines,
with all agreeing (for once). Fairly
close, though. Not more than two
touchdowns' difference.
U.S.C. over Washington, with Levy
dissenting and Weinberg holding out
for a slaughter of the Huskies. Oth
ers thought it would be close.
Cal to beat Fleet City by about two
touchdowns.
U.C.L.A. to beat St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, with Adams and Weinberg
for the Airdevils. Anybody's game.
Coast Guard over C.O'.P. without
too much difficulty.
Texas to murder Arkansas, Gu
gel disagreeing.
Texas A. &M. over T.C.U., with
Adams holding out for the Frogs.
(It came up "tails.")

Rice to take in S.M.U., endorsed
by all. By six or seven points.
Purdue to slaughter lowa by a
good 20 points.
Great Lakes to squeeze by Ohio
State, with Cohen protesting and
Weinberg offering to shoot anyone
who did not support his "alma ma
ter," the Navy team.
Indiana over Northwestern by a
couple of touchdowns, maybe.
Notre Dame to batter Wisconsin
something tragic. We'll be conserva
tive and say 30 points.
Navy to edge past Georgia Tech.
Best three out of five flips deter
mined this one. Mighty close.
North Carolina Pre-Flight over
Georgia Pre-Flight, all agreed. N.C.
flyers' upset of Navy rates them a
solid choice.
Army over Coast Guard Academy

by two or three touchdowns. Every
one strung along with Gugel, who
said he got a hot tip from a jockey
at Bay Meadows on this one.
Barney Gugel will be on hand next
week to tell you how gloriously the
experts perished.
