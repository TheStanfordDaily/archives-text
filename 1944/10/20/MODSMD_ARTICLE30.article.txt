# AST Echoes

### TOM BERRY 
On arriving at the Stanford cam
pus, much hullabaloo is generally
made of tbe fact that there are two
(at least two) means of verbal com
munication. One is the slanguage
you speak in college, and the other
js the slanguage you speak out of
college. That clear? Besides the
multitude of army slang words that
you already know, there is an ex
pression that is, as far as I can gather,
tvpically and exclusively ASTP. The
expression is "hanger's cream." The
t xact chemical formula worked out
by the men in the Berganic and Or
jL. nic chemistry courses (depending
< whether you have Dr. Bergstrom
or Dr. Ogg) is dimethyl ethyl bub
beline.
The exact meaning ol "hanger's
c . earn" like most slant* words in
t .eir embryonic development is a
little confused. One Gl thought it
was beer. Another thought it a rare
form of cheese. Some say that it is
a substance that will cure all ail
ments, shine shoes, in fact, do any
thing in the world.
Others maintain that it refers to
!'-.e fact that so many AST men (the
-called cream of the crop) are just
hanging on to the program with a C
average, hence "hanger's cream." So
i you hear someone casually men
tion "hanger's cream" the proper re
r.etion is to look confused. You are
confused? Splendid! Just remem
ber. "banker's cream" means exactly
v hat you think it means.

K.y that Bill Barbee has sent in a
requisition to General Marshall for
■ .ore soldiers to take care of the ex
isting campus ration. That last word
is ratio with a military accent. Pvt.
Barbee is chairman for the All-cam
pus semi-formal dance to be held
I>ec. 9 of this year. Bill calls for the
co-operation of all women on cam
pus in getting male participation.
He has tried, unsuccessfully as yet,
to get the first Military Science class
for the ASTRP to consist of, "How
to Date a Stanford Coed."
The Army Student Council started
out with a bang by securing a closed
rate for our semi-formal all-campus
dance. The Council this semester is
headed by one Tom Fletcher who is
really getting things rolling. As one
character put it, "His room looks like
a politician's with ward heelers run
ring in and out all night long."

Neglecting all interpretative judg
ments concerning the Friday night
dance in the Pavillion, we will be
content to observe that there were
more girls than boys present. In an
swer to a question: It is impossible
to divide the dances up according to
houses. For further information, see
Ex-com. Incidentally, we were grati
fied to see quite a few civilians
(males) at the dance last Friday
i :ght. We hope to see more of you,
f nd by more we don't mean just
; Lain, but in a numerical sense as
well.
Mike Donahue, social chairman,
has arranged a series of exchange
dinners with various houses on cam
jus. His first exchange with Bran
i er proved that Mike believes in
large-scale operations, as approxi
r ately eighty men participated in
the affair, as compared with the
t.sual fifteen per dinner at similar
.. 'airs last -emester.
