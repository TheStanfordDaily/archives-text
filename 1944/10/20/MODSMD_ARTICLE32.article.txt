# Farm Past Retold By Mrs. Cubberly
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
"My husband just stood there and cheered me on, while that goat chased
me and my bicycle down the street," said Mrs. Cubberley, wife of the late
Dean of Education, Elwood P. Cubberley.
In speaking of their early days at Stanford, Mrs. Cubberley was proving
her point that bicycles are no new institution on Farm roads. They were

popular long before automobiles in
vaded the campus, while the streets
were still dirt with two planks for
a sidewalk. Everyone rode them.
Mrs. Cubberley can remember ruin
in" many a long evening skirt by
catching it in the spokes on the way
to a party.
Some Transportation Good
jButnot all her transportation was
so undignified, she admits. On one
occasion Mrs. Stanford chartered a
special train to take the whole fac
ulty to San Francisco for a party at
her home on Nob Hill. "The deco
rations and refreshments were all
very elaborate," Mr?. Cubberley re
calls" and the special attraction was
an orchestrium. That was a player
organ much like the player piano of
today, the only one I have ever
seen."
The Cubberleys first came to
Stanford in '98 at the instigation of
David Starr Jordan. "He had been
our favorite professor when we were
mere students at the University of
Indiana," said Mrs. Cubberley, "and
it was good to work with him again.
He was always so friendly and in
spiring, the real originator of the
'Stanford spirit.' "
University Open Seven Years
When they first came hire, the
University had already been opened
seven years, and the real pioneers
considered them "rather upstarts."
For several years Dr. Cubberley
taught in the education department
with frequent leaves to teach at Co
lumbia, Harvard, and the University
of Chicago. Then the School of Edu
cation was founded, and he was ap
pointed its Dean.
"Of course our most exciting ex
perience in those early days was the
Earthquake," Mrs. Cubberley stated.
"It was all very weird. At 5 o'clock
i the morning we heard buildings
crashing, and all rushed down to the
Quad. First we saw the Arch had
fallen, then we noticed the Church
in ruins.
Dress Informal
"Of course most people came in
the first clothes they had found, some
were even in pajamas. But it was
Spring, and almost every girl had
dressed in her very best Easter out
tit to come view that pile of rubble.
"Stanford's wreckage was tremen
dous. Not only the tower, but the
new library and gym were com
pletely gone. All the lines to San
Francisco were destroyed, and ru
mors flew that the whole city had
been swallowed in a huge tidal wave.
In the evening we could see its fire
lighting the whole sky.
Some Small Tremors
"There were smaller quakes all
day, and we had to leave the dinner
table three times. For several nights
we had to sleep outdoors, then were
allowed to return to our homes.
Most of the students had left, but
the professors stayed to see it
through. I think our own worst job
was cleaning up the mess of jam and
jelly that covered our kitchen."
Dean Cubberley was always keenly
interested in his students. Perhaps
the most striking memorial to his in
' rest is the Cubberley Education
lilding which was formally opened
in 1938 on his 70th birthday. He
himself designed it and presented it
to Stanford.
Cubberley Entertained
Less striking, but just as lasting is
the memory carried by many a grad
uate of long pleasant evenings spent
at the Cubberley's home, when large
groups of students sat around the
big fireplace until late into the night
roasting marshmallows or weiners.
Mrs. Cubberley is carrying on their
tradition now, for her home is still
overflowing with noisy students. It
i.> called Hilltop House now, and she
lis formally given it to Stanford
University, keeping only a small
a'tnu'iit for herself. In making the

gift she explains that she was merely
carrying on her husband's work.
Hilltop House is a friendly place
where the girls work together and
the visitor is greeted by two exuber
ant dogs. Mrs. Cubberley denies that
she has become a house mother to
the girls, indeed she is not respon
sible for them in any way. But cer
tainly she is indispensable as a
fiiend. Her description is really best,
"We are all friends together."

special train to take the whole fac
ulty to San Francisco for a party at
her home on Nob Hill. "The deco
rations and refreshments were all
very elaborate," Mr?. Cubberley re
calls" and the special attraction was
an orchestrium. That was a player
organ much like the player piano of
today, the only one I have ever
seen."
The Cubberleys first came to
Stanford in '98 at the instigation of
David Starr Jordan. "He had been
our favorite professor when we were
mere students at the University of
Indiana," said Mrs. Cubberley, "and
it was good to work with him again.
He was always so friendly and in
spiring, the real originator of the
'Stanford spirit.' "
University Open Seven Years
When they first came hire, the
University had already been opened
seven years, and the real pioneers
considered them "rather upstarts."
For several years Dr. Cubberley
taught in the education department
with frequent leaves to teach at Co
lumbia, Harvard, and the University
of Chicago. Then the School of Edu
cation was founded, and he was ap
pointed its Dean.
"Of course our most exciting ex
perience in those early days was the
Earthquake," Mrs. Cubberley stated.
"It was all very weird. At 5 o'clock
i the morning we heard buildings
crashing, and all rushed down to the
Quad. First we saw the Arch had
fallen, then we noticed the Church
in ruins.
Dress Informal
"Of course most people came in
the first clothes they had found, some
were even in pajamas. But it was
Spring, and almost every girl had
dressed in her very best Easter out
tit to come view that pile of rubble.
"Stanford's wreckage was tremen
dous. Not only the tower, but the
new library and gym were com
pletely gone. All the lines to San
Francisco were destroyed, and ru
mors flew that the whole city had
been swallowed in a huge tidal wave.
In the evening we could see its fire
lighting the whole sky.
Some Small Tremors
"There were smaller quakes all
day, and we had to leave the dinner
table three times. For several nights
we had to sleep outdoors, then were
allowed to return to our homes.
Most of the students had left, but
the professors stayed to see it
through. I think our own worst job
was cleaning up the mess of jam and
jelly that covered our kitchen."
Dean Cubberley was always keenly
interested in his students. Perhaps
the most striking memorial to his in
' rest is the Cubberley Education
lilding which was formally opened
in 1938 on his 70th birthday. He
himself designed it and presented it
to Stanford.
Cubberley Entertained
Less striking, but just as lasting is
the memory carried by many a grad
uate of long pleasant evenings spent
at the Cubberley's home, when large
groups of students sat around the
big fireplace until late into the night
roasting marshmallows or weiners.
Mrs. Cubberley is carrying on their
tradition now, for her home is still
overflowing with noisy students. It
i.> called Hilltop House now, and she
lis formally given it to Stanford
University, keeping only a small
a'tnu'iit for herself. In making the

gift she explains that she was merely
carrying on her husband's work.
Hilltop House is a friendly place
where the girls work together and
the visitor is greeted by two exuber
ant dogs. Mrs. Cubberley denies that
she has become a house mother to
the girls, indeed she is not respon
sible for them in any way. But cer
tainly she is indispensable as a
fiiend. Her description is really best,
"We are all friends together."
"My husband just stood there and cheered me on, while that goat chased
me and my bicycle down the street," said Mrs. Cubberley, wife of the late
Dean of Education, Elwood P. Cubberley.
In speaking of their early days at Stanford, Mrs. Cubberley was proving
her point that bicycles are no new institution on Farm roads. They were

popular long before automobiles in
vaded the campus, while the streets
were still dirt with two planks for
a sidewalk. Everyone rode them.
Mrs. Cubberley can remember ruin
in" many a long evening skirt by
catching it in the spokes on the way
to a party.
Some Transportation Good
jButnot all her transportation was
so undignified, she admits. On one

When they first came hire, the
University had already been opened
seven years, and the real pioneers
considered them "rather upstarts."
For several years Dr. Cubberley
taught in the education department
with frequent leaves to teach at Co
lumbia, Harvard, and the University
of Chicago. Then the School of Edu
cation was founded, and he was ap
pointed its Dean.
"Of course our most exciting ex
perience in those early days was the
Earthquake," Mrs. Cubberley stated.
"It was all very weird. At 5 o'clock
i the morning we heard buildings
crashing, and all rushed down to the
Quad. First we saw the Arch had
fallen, then we noticed the Church
in ruins.
Dress Informal
"Of course most people came in
the first clothes they had found, some
were even in pajamas. But it was
Spring, and almost every girl had
dressed in her very best Easter out
tit to come view that pile of rubble.
"Stanford's wreckage was tremen
dous. Not only the tower, but the
new library and gym were com
pletely gone. All the lines to San
Francisco were destroyed, and ru
mors flew that the whole city had
been swallowed in a huge tidal wave.
In the evening we could see its fire
lighting the whole sky.
Some Small Tremors
"There were smaller quakes all
day, and we had to leave the dinner
table three times. For several nights
we had to sleep outdoors, then were
allowed to return to our homes.
Most of the students had left, but
the professors stayed to see it
through. I think our own worst job
was cleaning up the mess of jam and
jelly that covered our kitchen."
Dean Cubberley was always keenly
interested in his students. Perhaps
the most striking memorial to his in
' rest is the Cubberley Education
lilding which was formally opened
in 1938 on his 70th birthday. He
himself designed it and presented it
to Stanford.
Cubberley Entertained
Less striking, but just as lasting is
the memory carried by many a grad
uate of long pleasant evenings spent
at the Cubberley's home, when large
groups of students sat around the
big fireplace until late into the night
roasting marshmallows or weiners.
Mrs. Cubberley is carrying on their
tradition now, for her home is still
overflowing with noisy students. It
i.> called Hilltop House now, and she
lis formally given it to Stanford
University, keeping only a small
a'tnu'iit for herself. In making the

gift she explains that she was merely
carrying on her husband's work.
Hilltop House is a friendly place
where the girls work together and
the visitor is greeted by two exuber
ant dogs. Mrs. Cubberley denies that
she has become a house mother to
the girls, indeed she is not respon
sible for them in any way. But cer
tainly she is indispensable as a
fiiend. Her description is really best,
"We are all friends together."
"My husband just stood there and cheered me on, while that goat chased
me and my bicycle down the street," said Mrs. Cubberley, wife of the late
Dean of Education, Elwood P. Cubberley.
In speaking of their early days at Stanford, Mrs. Cubberley was proving
her point that bicycles are no new institution on Farm roads. They were

popular long before automobiles in
vaded the campus, while the streets
were still dirt with two planks for
a sidewalk. Everyone rode them.
Mrs. Cubberley can remember ruin
in" many a long evening skirt by
catching it in the spokes on the way
to a party.
Some Transportation Good
jButnot all her transportation was
so undignified, she admits. On one
occasion Mrs. Stanford chartered a
special train to take the whole fac
ulty to San Francisco for a party at
her home on Nob Hill. "The deco
rations and refreshments were all
very elaborate," Mr?. Cubberley re
calls" and the special attraction was
an orchestrium. That was a player
organ much like the player piano of
today, the only one I have ever
seen."
The Cubberleys first came to
Stanford in '98 at the instigation of
David Starr Jordan. "He had been
our favorite professor when we were
mere students at the University of
Indiana," said Mrs. Cubberley, "and
it was good to work with him again.
He was always so friendly and in
spiring, the real originator of the
'Stanford spirit.' "
