# Sunday's Recital Will Feature Liszt
## 
### 
Two works by Franz Liszt will be
featured on the program to be played
by Warren D. Allen, University Or
ganist, in his recital at 4 p.m. Sunday
in Memorial Church.
Sunday is the 133rd birthday an
niversary of the Hungarian master,
who was born October 22, 1811, so
the program substitutes two Liszt
compositions instead of music by
Handel in the current Bach-Handel
series of programs.
The two Liszt numbers which will
be played are 'Fantasia on a Choral"
from 'Le prophete' (Meyerbeer) and
"March of Homage" (Huldigungs
Marsch).
Also on the program are the
" 'Little' Fugue in G Minor" and a
group of Chorale-Preludes from "The
Little Organ-Book" by Bach. The
Chorale-Preludes include "A Saving
Health to Us is Brought," "Hark, a
Voice Saith. 'All are Mortal.
"Christ Lay in Bonds of Death." and
"In Thee is Gladness.'"
