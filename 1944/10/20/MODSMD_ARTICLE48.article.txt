# Stanford-Cal Debate Near
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Dewey-Roosevelt
debate with Cal began Wednesday
night when 28 members of the newly
formed Debating Society met to give
extemporaneous speeches supporting
their favorite candidate.
Semi-final tryouts, to choose the
squad which will meet Cal on No
vember 2 and 6, will be held Mon
day night from 7:30 to 10:00 in room
100.
Included among the tryoutees are
Republicans Leni Hill, Margaret Cox.
and Morley Thompson; and Demo
crats Ann Conner, Dorothy Mac
donald, Hudson Bowlby, Joy Dun
baugh. Camella Sanders, Bob Con
ner, A 1 Colburn, Pearl Montrand,
Sylvia Roberts, Donna Pickus, and
Marshall Small.
"Although Stanford is supposed to
be a Republican stronghold, so far
Dewey supporters have been in the
minority," said Carol Newton, debate
manager. Miss Newton added that
anyone Republican or Democrat,
who wants to try out for the Cal
debate may still do so by attending
the meeting on Monday night and
being prepared to give a five-minute
speech and a two-minute rebuttal.
The Stanford team will go to Cal
on November 2 to debate the affirma
tive of the question, "Resolved, that
the Dewey-Bricker ticket should be
elected," and later on election night,
November 6, will support the Demo
cratic ticket in the big debate with
Cal in the Education Auditorium.
