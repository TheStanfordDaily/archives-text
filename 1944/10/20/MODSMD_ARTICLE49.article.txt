# Benny Goodman Fails To Give Performance
## 
### 
Benny Goodman and the remnants oi' a once great band have top billing
in "Sweet and Low-Down," the ill-fated little vehicle that heads the Stan
lord Theater's current bill.
The usual petty jealousies of the boys in the band form what story there
is, with Lynn Bari again cast as a flirtatious singer. Mention is made of

►Goodman's early Chicago days on
I famed Halstead Street and his subse
| quent rise to fame.
Inexpensively produced, "Sweet
Lind Low-Down" is undoubtedly an
I attempt to cash in on Benny Good
' man's name. But the film contains
| little of Goodman's better music and
| has nothing to recommend it in any
! department.
"The Canterville Ghost," the sec
ond hall of the Stanford program,
pictures Charles Laughton as an
noxious ghost who spends his spa*
moments bothering Margaret O'Brien
: and Robert Young. The net result is
Mr. Laughton getting stuck in an
j other poor picture and the opinion
of this reviewer is that Miss O'Brien
get back into school and stay there.
The Varsity Theater, beginning
| Saturday, will have a very excep
i itonal double bill. First is "Going
! My Way*," a warm, human story thai
| will probably be 1944's top film
i Bing Crosby is his usual casual selr
j and Barry Fitzgerald sparkles in his
| first big film assignment.
The Varsity will also show "Home
| in Indiana," which heralds two new
| comers to the screen, Jeanne Crairt
1 and June Haver. It's a throbbing
tale of race horses that you're sure
I to enjoy.
