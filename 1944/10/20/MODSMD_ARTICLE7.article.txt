# WAR FRONTS

### Elliot Epsteen 
The steps toward the climax in the
| Pacific are lengthening and quicken
ing. Number two of the major ones j
is the present invasion of the Philip- :
pines.
These islands, as the reader prob- ;
ably knows, consist of two major
ones .Luzon on the northern end and
Mindanao on the southern, with a
cluster of smaller ones in between. I
American forces are seizing at least j
one of the clusters and Japanese re-
I ports have us making a landing on at
j least one other.
\ Tactical Move
The move was one of tactical art,
; since it threatens to drive a wedge j
between Luzon and Mindanao. It
I was immensely facilitated by the
Japanese commander, who expected
our thrust at Mindanao, and dis

posed of his forces accordingly.
Yet the major factor in the who!?
picture is Admiral Halsey's naval
operations in the north. Although he
did not get the Japanese navy into
a running battle, he did pin it down
to its harbors' and gave General
MacArthur's seapower a free hand
as far as enemy fleet intervention
is concerned.
Strategical Importance
Yet the strategical importance of a
success in the Philippines might be
partly negated by the Japanese ac
tion in China. Running trucks
through an underland tunnel built
between Japan and Korea, or across
the narrow straights separating ths
island from the peninsula, they can
bring their supplies down a fast
road to the south China coast, and
from there they can be transported
to the Indies, if the enemy can suc
ceed in 'establishing this overland
route. While the Japanese opera
tions in China are slowing down, it
must be noted that we have made, so
far, only a dent in the Philippines.
Our complete Success here will take
a long time, especially since the new
Japanese High Command is not com
posed of fools, and it has learned how
to sell an island as slowly and as
dearly as possible.
Invasion Plan
It seems that our invasion was
worked out on a plan conceived on
the basis of two separate fleets. r I he
first one was that controlled by Ad
miral Halsey, which was to pin down
the enemy navy or destroy it, while
the second one, under General Mac-
Arthur, was to move in as soon as
his naval companion had succeeded
in his objective. Now the next moves
will be to secure our control of the
central Philippines, and then to move
toward either of the two main ones,
on either of our flanks. Ihe most
probable choice should be Luzon,
since it will menace the Japanese
naval concentration area, and Gen
eral Mac Arthur has admitted that we
were expected in Mindanao.

I ports have us making a landing on at
j least one other.
\ Tactical Move
The move was one of tactical art,
; since it threatens to drive a wedge j
between Luzon and Mindanao. It
I was immensely facilitated by the
Japanese commander, who expected
our thrust at Mindanao, and dis

posed of his forces accordingly.
Yet the major factor in the who!?
picture is Admiral Halsey's naval
operations in the north. Although he
did not get the Japanese navy into
a running battle, he did pin it down
to its harbors' and gave General
MacArthur's seapower a free hand
as far as enemy fleet intervention
is concerned.
Strategical Importance
Yet the strategical importance of a
success in the Philippines might be
partly negated by the Japanese ac
tion in China. Running trucks
through an underland tunnel built
between Japan and Korea, or across
the narrow straights separating ths
island from the peninsula, they can
bring their supplies down a fast
road to the south China coast, and
from there they can be transported
to the Indies, if the enemy can suc
ceed in 'establishing this overland
route. While the Japanese opera
tions in China are slowing down, it
must be noted that we have made, so
far, only a dent in the Philippines.
Our complete Success here will take
a long time, especially since the new
Japanese High Command is not com
posed of fools, and it has learned how
to sell an island as slowly and as
dearly as possible.
Invasion Plan
It seems that our invasion was
worked out on a plan conceived on
the basis of two separate fleets. r I he
first one was that controlled by Ad
miral Halsey, which was to pin down
the enemy navy or destroy it, while
the second one, under General Mac-
Arthur, was to move in as soon as
his naval companion had succeeded
in his objective. Now the next moves
will be to secure our control of the
central Philippines, and then to move
toward either of the two main ones,
on either of our flanks. Ihe most
probable choice should be Luzon,
since it will menace the Japanese
naval concentration area, and Gen
eral Mac Arthur has admitted that we
were expected in Mindanao.
The steps toward the climax in the
| Pacific are lengthening and quicken
ing. Number two of the major ones j
is the present invasion of the Philip- :
pines.
These islands, as the reader prob- ;
ably knows, consist of two major
ones .Luzon on the northern end and
Mindanao on the southern, with a
cluster of smaller ones in between. I
American forces are seizing at least j
one of the clusters and Japanese re-
