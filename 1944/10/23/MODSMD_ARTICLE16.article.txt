"Don't have me expelled! I'll pay the twenty-five cents I owe
on the book." A stern voice from behind the counter says, "It's
no use pleading, the stop watch has that book clocked at 9:00
a.m., and it is now 9:05, and as this is the second time it's hap
pened, I am forced to put your case before the Vice-President
of A.S.S.U."
The violator shrugs his shoulders helplessly, and walks away
with head bent low. He now well knows his cause is a lost one,
and never again can he hold his head high, and say he is a true
Stanford "rough," because he has violated one of the cardinal
rules of the University, which is to return a book on time. He
had hoped to have his case put before the president of the Uni
versity, but ill fate has doomed him to have a hearing by that
domineering executive A A.S.S.U.
This is the type of daily happenings that take place in the
Reserved Book Room of the Main Library. The cadavers in the
place don't really belong to the Anatomy Dept., because I have
observed, that they can walk, talk, and read economics books.
As a matter of fact, they are sent there for so much outside read
ing in economics courses that natural passing of time makes
them look that way.
That couple you might see "smooching" in the dark corners
are not up to any nefarious tricks, but are merely saying hello;
in the friendly Stanford fashion. They probably don't even know
each other's names.
That foursome playing bridge in the middle of the room should
not be condemned, as the Cellar is closed evenings, due to the
lack of student help—Students please note.
That tired intellectual voice from behind the desk*ftiat purrs,
"Well you moron, what in hell do you want that we are out of?"
isn't really so mean, it's just that they think people are so stupid
if their "Bawlout" average isn't at least 90 plus 200.
All of the above things I have mentioned go to make up the
joyous little gathering of the clan, from 9 in the morning until 10
in the evening.
To end today's episode, why don't they make some sort of
provision for the returning of books before nine in the morning,
because you have an eight o'clock in the Chemistry Building,
and your class is released at nine, you have to walk damn fast
to get to the Library by nine—or do I confuse you?
