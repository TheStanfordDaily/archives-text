The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that a Stanford student should possess, among
other things, a respect for those who have been chosen to lead
them. Certainly not the least of these is Dr. Tresidder.
I was on the stage during the assembly Friday and saw a num
ber of students walk cut on Dr. Tresidder while he was speaking.
They did just that—they got up and walked out. I must admit
in all fairness that those students unquestionably had a reason
for doing as they did. None the less, the appearance was very
bad. So let's think twice before we walk out on anyone, and in
particular the President of our grand University.
