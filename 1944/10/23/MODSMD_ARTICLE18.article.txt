In a battle that brought to mind
memories of the Big Game, the D.G.
and the Kappa Hashers battled to a
24-24 tie, in a game which was played
in the Sunken Diamond. A gigantic
•rowd (about twenty D.G.'s and
wenty Kappas) roared their ap
proval as thier respective teams
(ought tooth and nail for the vic
ory. The excited fans cheered and
■it earned as the teams surged up
md down the field. Enthusiasm of
•very one there was terrific, for all

were interested in this first Stanford
! game of the year. We bring you
i snatches of the conversation of two
lof the excited spectators. "Whose
playing in this game?" Answer from
an' enthusiastic fan. "I don't know.
| 1 wonder Who is playing at Dinah's."
Casualties were at a minimum, as
the energy of the hard playing hash
ers dissipated rapidly as the game
wore on. The iron men on both teams
melted to wax. and the pulmotor and
the first aid squad were kept busier
than the players themselves.
