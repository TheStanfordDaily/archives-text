# WAR FRONTS

### Elliot Epsteen 
The Russians have opened a new
offensive which will increase the
tempo of the Balkan fighting con
siderably. This drive is the invasion
of Czechoslovakia, which, opening
with a sudden lunge across the
Carpathians, has already seized the
easternmost corner of that long and
narrow country.
The Red armies engaged in this
operation can strike out in either or
all of three directions. They can
move due west to Prague, the capi
tal of the country, the location ol
the Skoda armament works, and,
most important of all, an excellent
base for the invasion of southeastern
Germany, due to the many rail lines
branching out from it.
The new Russian invasion might
also channel itself toward Budapest,
where it would join the armies that
are fighting a fluid-tank battle
near the place, or dr,ive in a south
westerly direction toward Vienna,
where it could threaten the line of
German retreat around the Hun
garian capital.
Moves Considered %
A drive to Budapest would solidly
join the Russian front, but, consid
ering how hard the Germans are
pressed, this in itself might not be
so important. The enemy seems to
be too thoroughly beleaguered to
operate against separated segments
in detail (i.e., piecemeal-fashion).
Even so, such a statement must
certainly be qualified with the axiom

that, "in war, nothing is certain."
The Russian High Command, while
daring, is yet for the most part
cautious, so it is debatable as to
whether or not this route will be
followed.
An advance on Prague would bring
more dividends, but, in considering
this as an alternative, it must be
noted that the Russian forces in
Czechoslovakia has roufed its op
position, while the Red forces around
Budapest are advancing slowly
again still opposition. Thus there
is a danger that a drive due west
by the Russians might push forward
too fast, and the Allies' line in the
Balkans might get too far out of
alignment. Also, this offensive would
soon have to surmount difficult
mountainous terrain. Prague itself
was used as a defensive position
both during the Thirty Year's War
and the Seven Year's War. If the
Russians in Czechoslovakia should
strike out toward this city, they
might be held in front and then
have their Hank driven in by a Ger
man drive launched from western
Hungary or Austria. If the Russians
attempt this particular offensive,
they might push a column out
toward the forces around Budapest,
thus securing their flank.
A move on Vienna is, however,
the most pregnant in possibilities.
Considering its importance as a com
munications center, this city is prob
ably the main enemy-base in the
Balkans, and the capture of it would
also seriously threaten the lines of
German retreat in Hungary, as was
mentioned before.
