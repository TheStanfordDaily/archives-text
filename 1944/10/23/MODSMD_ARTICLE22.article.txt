The Stanford Bookstore was
broaght into existence in 1898 when
Dr. Jordan, recognizing the crying
need for a store convenient to the
Campus, requested a group of fac
ulty members to lay plans for such
a co-operative enterprise. Hitherto.
Stanford's students and faculty alike
had been obliged to go to Paio Alto
in order to purchase their supplies
and their books.
This group of professors—pioneers
of co-operative undertaking in Cali
fornia—organized the Bookstore as
a service existing solely for the con
venience of the University. It is ad I
ministered by a Board of Directors
which receives no remuneration for
its services. Moreover, it is not
owned by any person or group of
persons—all profits are shared with
the members of the A.S.S.U. in the
form of rebates.
These rebates are receipts for the
amount each customer has pur
chased. It is according to the total
sum represented by these Rebates
that a cash return is paid at the end
of the year. The percentage returned
to the purchaser depends on the total
volume of business enacted during
the year. Last year the Bookstore
paid a rebate of ten per cent, accord
ing to Mrs. Bochou, director.
