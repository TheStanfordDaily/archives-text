# USO Series Will Been
## 
### 
Pians for the War Social adjust
ment group of the 'Y,' which is an
expansion of last year's USO junior
hostess series, have been completed
by Nancy Banning, chairman of the
group, and her co-chairman Sally
Teachout.
Beginning the quarter's piogram
will be an informal introductory talk
by Mrs. Paul Rathbun next Friday
afternoon at 1 p.m. in the Women's
Clubhouse. On the following Fri
day, a psychologist will discuss the
problems being faced daily by vet
|ins, and the adjustments those
flO come in contact with them will
be forced to make.
Veterans to Have Panel
Students who have returned to
college from the war fronts will com
prise a panel for open discussion on
their reactions to the swift changes
and consequent problems they have
faced. The fourth meeting will be
devoted to USO junior hostess advice
and instruction.
This series of lectures has been re
modelled this year in view of the
increasing need for understanding
of veteran problems.
Already these problems are being
encountered each day, and with the
end of the war imminent, not one
person on campus, said Miss Ban
ning, will be excluded from contact
with situations of maladjustment.
Attend Four Meetings
Attendance at the four meetings
will constitute fulfillment of the re
quirements for a USO junior hostess
card. Women who missed one lec
ture during the series presented
spring quarter may attend one in
this series and receive their certi
ficates.
The War Social Adjustments com
mittee is a 'Y' group working in co
operation with the War Board. At
tendance at the lectures counts as
war work for women.
