# Janie Has Difficulties In Boisterous Comedy
## 
### 
Warner Brothers' "Janie." adapted '
from the successful stage play, is a
boisterous, raucous bit of humor that
was made for laughing purposes !
only.
Janie's troubles start when a very J
compromising picture of herself and
her current boy-friend appears on j
the cover of LIFE. Then she meets J
a soldier from a near-by camp and j
several amusing, but highly improb
able. escapades occur with him. Af
fairs reach a climax with a wild
house party that involves everybody
from Janie's father (Edward Arnold)
co the military police.
Joyce Reynolds as Janie gives an
adequate performance in her first big
assignment. Robert Benehley and
Edward Arnold lend sympathetic
touches to their roles while Alan I
Hale is amusing as a college chemis- ■
try professor who likes to hear "The !
Lone Ranger."
Tom Conway, whom we might call
'the king of the B's," has the title

role in the second feature, "The Fal
con in Mexico." This time Tom heads
below the border for the usual
amount of chasing around dark hall
ways and back alleys. Just another
one of those things.—Dick Bower.
