# Dr. Rael Tells Of Labor Camps
## 
### 
"On the whole, the Mexicans are
thrifty and industrious," .said Dr.
Juan Rael in the initial lecture of
the Hispanic World Series given last
Thursday.
Dr. Rael's address, entitled "Mexi
can Labor Camps in the United
I States," concerned his experiences in
one of these camps during the sum
] mer.
The speaker told his audience that
| the importation of Mexican labor to
j help with the crops is under the di
i rection of the War Foods Adminis- j
j tration and explained the procedure 1
by which the workers are procured.
Each worker is under a six-month {
contract which guarantees him the
! prevailing wage-rate of the state in
which he works, 10'; of the wage is 1
j withheld and returned to Mexico
where the laborer can get it upon
j his return. In addition, he is guar-
I anteed work 70'< of the time. Trans- 1
portation costs both to and from
Mexico are paid by the United States
i government.
j "Many of the workers do not re
i new their contracts because they are
anxious to get home," explained Dr.
Rael, "and even when no trains are
available to return them to Mexico, â€¢

they will sit around and, refuse to
work."
In reply to a question from the
audience, Dr. Rael declared that in
his opinion the importation of Mexi

can labor has been successful but
that after a specific date no contracts
are to be renewed. Plans are to re
place the Mexican workers with Ger
man prisoners-of-war.
