# Plans Begin To Reopen Fraternity Houses Soon
## 
### BILL EILERS 
Plans for the resumption of fraternity living groups as soon as eco
nomically possible were disclosed last night by Dick Fayram, Chairman
of the Interfraternity Board at Stanford.
In a letter to all Stanford fraternity men, JFayram called a meeting for

next Thursday, October 2G. in Room
E-2 to discuss mutual problems.
"Of course," remarked Fayram,
"there's no formal rushing at Stan
ford 'frats' for the duration, but in
formal contacts are made with eli
gible men. Men may be pledged and
initiated, but must be registered with
the Interfraternity Board.
Post-war Planning
At the Thursday get-together, the
chairman will discuss questions aris
ing from the report of the Post-War
Planning Committee and those con
cerned with current fraternity prob
lems. The committee was formed by
last year's chairman, A 1 Cleveland,
Ray Alden, and Wylie Hartman.
In this report of the committee,
sent to each Stanford fraternity
member, the Board announced pro
cedure for resuming living groups
when sufficient men return to the
campus to make it feasible economi
cally.
The report also declared pre-war
fraternity standards of academic
standing and balanced social pro
grams would be reinstated. Men
tioned too was the fact that the
"frats" will continue to improve the
definite program of teaching pledges,
the fraternity history, customs, and
background.
Rushing Rules
"Freshmen," Fayram said, "should
know that Stanford pledging is nor
mally done through the Interfra
ternity Council. Students now wish
ing to be 'rushed' will be given cards
on which to state their house prefer
ences. These cards will be distrib
uted to the designated groups, who in
turn will invite 'rushees' to sched
uled social events."
First quarter freshmen and stu
dents on probation are not eligible
for pledging. Eligible men wishing
to obtain rushing preference cards
should see Fayram at Washington
Hall or contact any fraternity presi
dent.
The Board and the Committee on
Post-War Planning have been at
work since early this year outlining
preliminary steps for living group
resumption. Recommendations as to
the operation of the temporarily dis
banded fraternities were also ad
vanced.
"Our present plans hinge on the
fact that a minimum number of men
are necessary to resume living
groups," Fayram explained. "We
hope to determine how many men
are available at the Thursday meet
ing."
Dick Fayram. who was elected last
spring by the Board of Control, is a
Mechanical Engineering Major and
a member of Alpha Kappa Lambda.
