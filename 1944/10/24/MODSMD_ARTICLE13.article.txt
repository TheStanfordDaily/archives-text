# Tresidder Talks Of Postwar Medical Teaching Problems
## 
### 
The problem of whether or not to
continue in the postwar period the
accelerated teaching program now in
operation in our medical schools
"fades into minor significance" in
comparison with the many important
issues confronting medical educators,
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, president
of Stanford University, yesterday
told the meeting of the American
Association of Medical Colleges now
in session at the Statler Hotel.
Stressing the fact that acceleration
is inevitable as a wartime emergency
measure to meet the critical shortage
of doctors. Dr. Tresidder suggested
that the important issue to consider
is "an analysis of the degree of com
petence we want developed in the
medical profession and the means by
which it can be developed."
"The major problem facing medi
cal education today." he said, "is not
acceleration or deceleration but a
reconsideration and rigorous study
of the entire teaching program in the
light of present day requirements to
determine what can be eliminated
from the course usually offered and
what needs to be added."
'Likewise, according to Dr. Tresid
der, "There is a need at this time to
review the interneship to determine
what it should accomplish for the

! young doctor and then to provide
| the essential experience."
Arguing strongly for a broad gen-
J eral education and working experi
j ence during the summer months for
the medical student, Dr. Tresidder
said, "I would be most reluctant to
give up advantages of a broader
education for the sake of preserv
ing an aspect of medical education
that was put into practice as an
emergency measure."
Dr. Tresidder suggested that in
structional methods should be re
viewed "in order to ascertain what
are the most effective methods to be
followed in each course." The meth
ods of selection of medical students
should be revamped in the light of
wartime experience, stated Dr. Tres
idder.
In closing, Stanford's president
challenged his audience to answer
the major issues which he presented
I in "such a way as to provide society
I with the highest quality of doctors."
