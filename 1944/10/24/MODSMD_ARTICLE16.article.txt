# Bull Session

### BARBARA UPSHAW 
Guest Bull-Sessioner
Let it be understood from the be
ginning that I have ifo intention of
undermining the success and acclaim
A'hich has rightly come to your o-so
witty Bull Sessioner by writing this
column today.
This space is given over every day
to Crane's reflections on topics of
conversation about the campus,
sometimes humorous, sometimes not
humorous, and sometimes intention
ally not humorous. And, since this
column is often the topic of conver
sation among its mafiy followers, I
have asked that Crane be retired for
the day while I bull friendly about
his sessions.
At random, completely at random,
I have chosen Monday's column to
discuss. I could have picked up any
'copy of the Daily, Volumd 106,
turned to the B. S., and found the
same priceless charm for which your
regular Bull Sessioner is so widely
noted.
However. I picked Monday's ar
ticle, because it deals with a subject
alien to my modest realm of ac
quaintance; my comments and criti
cisms, therefore, will be made en
tirely on the basis of literary tech
nique, editorial policy, and actual
writing ability, uninhibited by per
sonal prejudice on the subject.
The Session began yesterday, as
usual, with a flourish of misinforma
tion. Granted, that it was cleverly

put down; but must we sacrifice
Truth ior an inaudible chortle in our
o'clocks? Must we poison the
minds of the naive and gullible with
unreal horrors for the sake of a bit
of mouldy humor?
Granted, that the Libe has regula
tions regarding the return of books,
and undoubtedly there is a fine im
posed when this regulation is ig
nored. But is it necessary to exag
gerate this fine to the exorbitant sum
of five cents per minute and distort
the facts to include a hearing before
that, and I quote, "domineering exec
utive," the A.S.S.U. Vice-President,
thus hurling fear into the heart of
the Little Man, discouraging his
quest for a higher education, and
consequently lowering the standard
of living? I say, no; this is not hu
mor: this is a political outrage.
It is neither my will nor position
to split hairs as to whether or not
the librarians are harpies, the Econ
students are dying on the vine in
the Reserved Book Room, and the
student body Vice-President is, and
I quote, "domineering"; but I do
question the strength and integrity
of a policy which permits such jeop
ardy of innocent individuals and
ultimate destruction of the Finer
Things in life.
The Bull Session is an Institution;
Crane is the most widely read col
umnist in the Upper Santa Clara
Valley and Midland, Michigan. When
is the Chaparral coming out this
quarter? (Editorial note: who cares?)
