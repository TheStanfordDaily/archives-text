# Cabbages and Things

### Ed Maher 
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't shout "rebel" yet. I'm not
trying to instigate anything untried
into these pages or to start a new
tradition at Stanford. The boss
knows that I'm not original enough
for that. What this attempts to be is
a revival of a column once as well
known and as popular as Bull Ses
sion is now. So, in the nature of a
preface, here are a few facts con
cerning the original Cabbages and
Things culled from twenty minutes
of true academic research among the
old Dippy files:
In the Daily Palo Alto of Thurs
day, October 21, 1920, Editor E. E.
Crowe announced the advent of the
new "colyum" which appeared on
|sage two. Cabbages and Things was
written by one R.W.K. whom fur
ther research proved to be R. W.
Kenny, '21, Managing Editor.
Ironic Amusement
The "colyum," as they took delight
in calling it, was surrounded by edi
torials and U.P. news stories which
have value for us only in the kinds
of ironic amusement they afford. My
mother and father were going steady
during this time, but there is no men
tion of it in the paper.
What was included was of more
international significance. For ex-
Ample, a revolution in Mexico had
â– subsided somewhat, a deposed gov
ernment official had been driven out,
ind things seemed "to be looking
Lip" according to the correspondent.
I' ken geopolitically, this statement
night imply that the diplomat may
iave fled to San Antonio; taken
spiritually, he was probably shot.
Democrats Sad
An editorial commenting op. a re

cent straw ballot which favored Sen
ator Harding says that it was a bad
year for the Democrats. Further
comment from me is too apparent
even to be humorous. But the pay
off of them all is the dispatch from
the marked metropolis of Tokio, It
seems that a huge religious service
had been held for the repose of the
souls of all the poultry slain during
the past year.
The solemn celebration was
prompted by the chicken dealers
themselves, prompted most likely
by a misguided advertising scheme.
"Those living things love life as
much as we do," quotes one of the
feather merchants, "Therefore it is
proper that we comfort their spirits."
Oh Heaven Forbid
I read several of Mr. Kenny's col
umns in an attempt to discover his
style, subject matter, and reason for
existence. My intention was to imi
tate him if I could. It is with relief
and pleasure that I announce that
my intention is hereby forfeited, for
I confess that I could make neither
head nor tail out of Kenny.
His allusions were strange and
meaningless to me: his humor (and
I speak charitably) was not; and his
style was a weird mixture combin
ing of Howard Brubaker, "Bugs"
Baer, and Barney Gugel. Of course,
these lay me wide open to the scorn
of any researching revivalist of 1966
who may read the series that follow,
but I'll chance it.
All this has been just historical
background. For anyone who is in
terested in what this column is to be
about, all that I can offer at this
early is to refer that person to
the writia ,-i cf Lewis Carroll. That's
