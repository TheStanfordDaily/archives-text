The Editor:
That Social Policy problem is in
again. Those who were here last !
spring will remember that alter at i
least six months of darned unpleas
ant work. Executive Committee
adopted a Policy thought to be at
leasf tair. Now, it appears, the prob- |
lem is to be declared unsolved as j
ever. The prospects of six months' ;
more work are appalling.
Another Try
The problem is simple of state
ment. The average age of Stanford J
men and women has dropped. Nerves j
are presumably not as steady as in |
peace-time, and the activities and
examples which formerly gave con- I
structive direction to leisure are con- I
siderably curtailed. As a result, more j
students than before have stepped
over the line of good taste: alcohol I
has reared its head more often.
We have, and fortunately, student j
government. It has rightly been in
sisted that the students' own govern
ment do all in its power to solve the
problem. So far, it has not suc
ceeded, and another try seems immi
nent. Excom is duty bound to do its
best.
The Rational 99 Per Cent
There is an old saying that "you
can't legislate sense into fools." Yet :
this is exactly what our govern- |
ment must try to do. It must do j
Something to induce the "rational
99% of our student body to con- 1
duct themselves, always, with intelli
gence and moderation. It is, in a
sense, the last problem of any gov
ernment.

How can the problem be faced?
To attempt to prohibit the use of
alcohol by students, in any form and
any place, would be absolutely in
effectual. So also would be an at
tempt to submit every function of a
social nature to supervision. The
"rational 99%" would know with a
sure wisdom that such solutions were
not getting at the root of the prob
lem. Their intelligence would be in
sulted, and the enforcing powers
would face universal ridicule and
evasion.
Organize!
Excom is expected to legislate on
this. Let it legislate a policy, not of
prohibition or of supervisory red
tape or of legalistic nonsense, but of
iron-clad definition of what it ex
pects by Way of intelligent and mod
erate conduct. Let it ponder the
Fundamental Standard, and what
that admHable restatement fully im
plies. Then, let it get at the heart of
the problem by adopting a policy of
encouraging every possible group
activity, every possible friendly and
social gathering, every possible op
portunity for contact with all that is
good and constructive in the com
munity.

Make it possible, even more, en
! courage, the younger students to
{ come in intimate organized asso
ciation with such older students as
i are left. Encourage the men to form
i social groups on their
; age the women, older, younger, hall,
row, or what have you, to seek out
those with whom they will be con
genial and to do all they can to
gether by way of social activity.
Progress will be painfully slow.
| The war is, of course, the primary
i source of the trouble. But even
! while it is still going on, the "ra
tional 99%" will be glad to co-operate
| with any truly intelligent attitude.

The Rational 99 Per Cent
There is an old saying that "you
can't legislate sense into fools." Yet :
this is exactly what our govern- |
ment must try to do. It must do j
Something to induce the "rational
99% of our student body to con- 1
duct themselves, always, with intelli
gence and moderation. It is, in a
sense, the last problem of any gov
ernment.

How can the problem be faced?
To attempt to prohibit the use of
alcohol by students, in any form and
any place, would be absolutely in
effectual. So also would be an at
tempt to submit every function of a
social nature to supervision. The
"rational 99%" would know with a
sure wisdom that such solutions were
not getting at the root of the prob
lem. Their intelligence would be in
sulted, and the enforcing powers
would face universal ridicule and
evasion.
Organize!
Excom is expected to legislate on
this. Let it legislate a policy, not of
prohibition or of supervisory red
tape or of legalistic nonsense, but of
iron-clad definition of what it ex
pects by Way of intelligent and mod
erate conduct. Let it ponder the
Fundamental Standard, and what
that admHable restatement fully im
plies. Then, let it get at the heart of
the problem by adopting a policy of
encouraging every possible group
activity, every possible friendly and
social gathering, every possible op
portunity for contact with all that is
good and constructive in the com
munity.

Make it possible, even more, en
! courage, the younger students to
{ come in intimate organized asso
ciation with such older students as
i are left. Encourage the men to form
i social groups on their
; age the women, older, younger, hall,
row, or what have you, to seek out
those with whom they will be con
genial and to do all they can to
gether by way of social activity.
Progress will be painfully slow.
| The war is, of course, the primary
i source of the trouble. But even
! while it is still going on, the "ra
tional 99%" will be glad to co-operate
| with any truly intelligent attitude.

That Social Policy problem is in
again. Those who were here last !
spring will remember that alter at i
least six months of darned unpleas
ant work. Executive Committee
adopted a Policy thought to be at
leasf tair. Now, it appears, the prob- |
lem is to be declared unsolved as j
ever. The prospects of six months' ;
more work are appalling.
Another Try
The problem is simple of state
ment. The average age of Stanford J
men and women has dropped. Nerves j
are presumably not as steady as in |
peace-time, and the activities and
examples which formerly gave con- I
structive direction to leisure are con- I
siderably curtailed. As a result, more j
students than before have stepped
over the line of good taste: alcohol I
has reared its head more often.
We have, and fortunately, student j
government. It has rightly been in

ment do all in its power to solve the
problem. So far, it has not suc
