# Arthur, Arguello Grids Ready for Action
## 
### 
(This is the first in a series of pre
views on six-man football squads
which will swing into action next
week.—Ed.)
Maybe it's because l 'A" is the first
letter in the alphabet or even be
cause Captain Bill Adams usually
leads off first in roll call that Ar
thur Hall wins first glances today.
An abundance of material with all
too little time for practice is ihe
situation facing Arthur's "Hilltop
pers.. way "up thar."
At the wing posts are Hug Cox
and De Witt Mastick, both powerful
on offense and defense. Cox gained
experience playing with Buchanan's
Bearcats during the summer, while
Mastick caught a few touchdown
.Kisses for Tyler last fall. Mastick
knows football and gained some real
experience at Tamalpais High.
Shcr at Full
'"Bilge" Adams, head coach and
ball snapper, fills out the center of
the line and is noted for his power
ful playing at Adams Hall in last
year's league.

In the backfield, speedy Joe Sher
! and Scott Chaffee are expected to
j alternate at the fullback position.
| Chaffee also scooted around for Ty
; ler last year.
Arthur can boast some fancy half
-1 backs in Dave Rust, Cal Kuhn, and
Ed Maher. Rust, formerly a buck at
Hayward High, is a "pretty nice
| ball-handler," according to Captain
Adams, who also points out that
Kuhn is no slouch at blocking.
Reserve material might well spell
victory for the Arthur bunch, espe
| cially with Bill Snow. Herb Behring,
.
and Bob Davis ready to back up the
starting crew.
Situated far down on Arguello
Street, the Arguello Athletic Asso

ciation, coached by Chuck Doe. ap
pears to be awaiting opening day
with plenty of secrets in the bag.
Doe, a pounding fullback at Menlo
; only a year ago, expects his squad to
l do a little of the unexpected and
upset some of the bigger boys. At
: ends are Morley Thompson, huge
i basketball star from Lincoln High
; in San Francisco and no stranger to
! a football field, and huge Bob
Abrarns. Abrams had experience at
West Point before his entrance to
jStanford.
At center, "little" Joe Pickering,
carrying football records from Le
Grange High in Illinois, is expected
to more than fill the pivot post.
Bradshaw a Threat
' A speedy backfield is the boast of

Doe, who will be flanked by Jim
Bradshaw and Gordon Levy at
i halves. Bradshaw, formerly a star
| on Fresno High teams, is a triple
threat at all times. Levy, a Buch
anan player last summer, will skirt
the ends.
Arguello is not lacking in reserves
I either, for in the backfield are Don
I Rouillard, Salt Lake City quarter
j back, and Dave Saunders of San
j Jose. A 1 Crawford, mountain line
man, is counted on to ably fill any
; vacancies in the line.
Doe points out that his team is
j well-balanced with weight and
height on the line and speed to burn
in the backfield. AAA appears to
be ready to go against their more
1 experienced and bigger foes.
