# 'Kit Carson' Steals Show
## 
### 
The fall series of "Shaughnessy
| Shows" opened Sunday evening at
j Memorial Theater as 375 enthusiastic
• patrons sat in on Orson Welles' "The
Magnificent Ambersons." But judg
ing from the shrieks of frenzied de
i light that greeted its appearance,
J "Fighting With Kit Carson," the
j blood-curdling serial, was the eve
j ning's highlight.
"The Magnificent Ambersons" em
ployed Orson Welles' usual tech-
I niques in the photography, music,
: and sound departments to present a
! somber study of a rich, arrogant
! family and its disintegration. Jo-
I seph Cotten and Tim Holt held f'ea
j ture roles, both turning in superior
I performances.
But back to that sterling saga of
the days when men were men and
women were damn glad of it, "Fight
' ing With Kit Carson." Noah Berry,
Sr. masterfully portrayed the evil
genius behind the Mystery Riders, a
j cloaked group of ruffians who roam
the countryside singing a wierd chant
of long ago. Johnny Mack Brown
personifies sweetness and light by
j broad-jumping onto his horse and
taking pot shots at most of the cast.
Chapter 5, presented Sunday night,
| found Noah Beery, Sr., poisoning a
helpless settler, Johnny Mack Brown
| jumping off a high cliff into the
swirling waters below, and the rest
j of the cast trying to remember their
, lines.
At the final fade-out Johnny Mack
j Brown was lunging forward with a
J bullet in his heart and a last, linger
| ing "Aloha" on his lips, while Noah
Berry was with some of the "boys"
in the backroom plotting new devil
ment for Chapter 6.—Dick Bower
