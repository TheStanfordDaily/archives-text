# BULL SESSION

### Dick Crane 
In a small brown printed booklet, that is published every
quarter for the "new low price of fifteen cents," there is con
tained every conceivable bit of information that concerns the
average sudent.
This booklet can be obtained at the cashier's desk of the Ad
building at the beginning of each quarter, by depositing the
above named sum in the little box provided for that purpose.
As a warning to all "chintzes," when you do deposit the correct
sum for this article, you do not receive any change in return.
The first part of this little bargain contains miscellaneous and
uninteresting information about dull and prosaic things such as
committees, professors, and scholars. The main body of the
booklet however, contains the scholastic averages of all the
undergraduates, which is the reason the little gem I have been
so diligently talking about is called the "Bawlout."
The "Bawlout," is itself a Stanford institution, and is strictly
the key point of all the important activity on campus, which is
of course social activity. For example, if a campus male was
undecided as to which girl to take out on a Saturday evening,
he would immediately scan this printed volume, and find out
her "Bawlout" average. Too high—no soap. Too low—some
dope, but oh! brother.
By this last bit of corny prose, I am not advocating the getting
of low grades to be among the socially popular people, as there
are many exceptions to the case; however I was just stating the
normal reaction.
Moving on in my observations, the next important thing men
tioned is the home addresses of the students. The item tha!
impresses me most is the fact that anyone who lives within a
hundred mile radius of Los Angeles states his address as
Beverly Hills. I have been there, and I really don't understand
the strange fascination of southern Californians for the place.
Perhaps it's because they can say they live ten miles from
Boris Karloff.
Leaving the undergraduate body sad or glad, depending on
the "Bawlout," I will move on to the last part of the booklet
which contains the various student committees, and officious
officials of our ruling organizations. It then moves on to the
telephone numbers of the living groups, which might be inter
esting if you like it, and at last ends with a happy note, the
various places to turn in fire alarm signals. No happy home
should be without one.
