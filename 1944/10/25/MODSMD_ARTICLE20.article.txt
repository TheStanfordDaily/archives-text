The limited Allied offensive in
Holland is again progressing. Its
existence shows that General Demp
sey has consolidated his wedge with
its tip at Nijmegen enough to attack
from it and expand it.
General Dempsey, as was men
tioned in a previous article, is try
ing both to clear out German posi
tions threatening his use ol - Antwerp,
thus gaining a short supply line for
his army, and is also pushing south
ward to connect the right of his
wedge with our bulge in the enemy
lines around Aachen, possibly join
ing with General Hodges for a com
bined drive into the center of the
enemy position. His progress in both
attempts is excellent.
Recent Operations
The German positions threatening
Antwerp are located on the banks of
the broad Schelde estuary, or the
mouth of the Rhine. General Demp
sey has been trying simultaneously
to push this pocket back and cut it

off from the rest of the German line.
He has been employing three sepa
rate units in these operations. The
first are Canadian ground troops op
erating overland from Antwerp; the
second are Oak Leaf amphibious
forces moving against the islands in
the Schelde estuary and the rear of
the German troops on the banks, and
the third are English, moving from
the area of the corridor thrust to
Nijmegen, who are attempting the
latter part of the task. The reach
ing by the English forces of 'S-Heter
ogenbach, known in military history
by the much less formidable name of
Bar-le-duc, yesterday has seriously
threatened the enemy communica
tions. They should soon be pulling

out of their post all along the line,
and thus the Canadian forces should
not have much trouble in taking
heavily fortified positions such as
Fort Frederik-Hendrick. also undiy
assault.
General Dempsey has suddenly
thrust out again with the southern
side of his salient, pushing on
towards the junction with General
Hodges. While the wedge to Nijmen
gen is a narrow salient pushed far
ahead of the regular line, and thus
vulnerable to attacks on either flank,
the German front around it is also a
re-entrant angle, and General Demp
sey is taking good advantage of this
fact. Allied control of the Schelde.

bring up the British left to a line
with the salient's end, and this,
coupled with a drive to join Gen
eral Hodges, will very nicely secui|
the Nijmegen corridor against any
German turning maneuver.

off from the rest of the German line.
He has been employing three sepa

the third are English, moving from
the area of the corridor thrust to

attempts is excellent.
