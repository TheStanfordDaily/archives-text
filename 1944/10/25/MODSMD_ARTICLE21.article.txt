### BILL ADAMS 
Well, well. It looks as it, on the j
first play of the game, the Daily's
mighty staff of football "experts" got
thrown for one terrific loss. How
ever, it was a week of upsets in gen- |
oral, and we don't feel so bad about j
it. We only lost face; you lost the j
dough.
In all. 15 games were predicted by I
tho live experts—Weinberg, Gugel, i
Levy, Cohen, ancl Yours Truly. Here !
are the winning percentages for tho I
first week: "Bilge" Adams (that's
me) called 12 out of the 15 right to |
lead the boys with an average of
.800. Weinberg and Cohen ended in
•i dead heat lor second with 11 wins
Jhch for a .733 percentage. Levy and i
Gugel are rumored to be running \
yet .bringing up tho rear with nine J
solid wins out of 15, to mark up a
now national record of (ahem) .600. j
