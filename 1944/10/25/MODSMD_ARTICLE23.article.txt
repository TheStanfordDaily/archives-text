# Buchanan Fields Hot Grid Team
## 
### 
"If they want speed, that's what
they'll get," says Frenchy Hoen, star
quarterback on the Buchanan Bear
cat football squad. Frenchy, along
with four other returning boys,
helped lead his team to a victorious
Summer Quarter season, and is out
to make it a repeat performance this
quarter.
Bolstering the squad will be re
turning veterans Bud Riehter, Frank
Hoffman, Don Prince, Dick Dormodi,
and Mort Cohen. Also on the Buch
anan squad are Tom Steege, Charley
MeClung, and Faunny Ho.
Leading the team at left half will
probably be Riehter. As well as be
ing a tcrriffic pass-receiver, Bud is
a dangerous runner.
The same goes for Prince and
Frenchy. Both of them saw consid
erable action on their high school
squads, and both of them are dan
gerous in an open field. Frenchy
will probably take on the job of
signal calling. Although compara
tively small, he is a powerful blocker.
As for Prince, one look at him and
you can see how dangerous he is.
This year, he will take over one end
position. His speed and gluey fingers
make him a terror on offense.
Hoffman, last quarter's captain,
adds the much needed brawn to the
line. His favorite position is center,
and he gets a "big drive" out of
knocking people around.
The surprise of the team, however,
might be â€¢ Faunny Ho, of Hawaii.
When it comes to speed, and that's
a prerequisite in touch tackle. Faun
ny will be around to supply it. In
the few practices that Bearcats have
had, Faunny was outstanding.
