# DR. P.J. TREAT
## Far Eastern Authority Will Retire This Year 
### PATTY PATTEN 
One of the foremost American stu
j dents of Far Eastern relations, Dr.
| Payson Jackson Treat of the history
j department, will retire from Stan
! ford this year.
Stanford was the first university to
establish a chair in Far Eastern his
-1 tory, and Dr. Treat was the first man
to devote himself to full-time in
struction in this field.
During the Russo-Japanese war of
j 1904-05 David Stair Jordan, presi
dent of the University, and Max Far-
I rand, head of the history department,
decided that too little attention had
been directed toward the Far East,
and in 1906 Dr. Treat was appointed
; as instructor of Far Eastern history.
During 1906-07, Dr. Treat studied
and prepared himself at his own ex
pense, travelling through India,
, South Asia, East Asia, Australia, and
New Zealand.
During 37 years 7.000 men and
women have enrolled in Dr. Treat's
; classes, which sometimes had as
many as 250 students at one time.
Twenty per cent of the students in
| his course this quarter are legacies—
i children of former students.
j The Far Eastern Department was
enlarged when Yamato Ichihashi
was appointed professor of Japanese
history in 1913, a post which he held
until he retired in 1942. Dr. Ichi
| hashi specialized in Japanese civili
| zation while Dr. Treat covered the
international relations, diplomacy,
j and politics of Japan.
Dr. Treat has made four trips to
J the Far East during the time he has
i been teaching at Stanford, his last
i trip being made in 1935. A fifth trip
j had been planned for January, 1942,
! "But," he said, "transportation was
' not available due to circumstances
' beyond my control." After the war
Dr. Treat hopes to make this fifth
trip.
During his 37 years of study, JDr.
Treat has written seven books in
this field, specializing in Japanese-
American relations. Although his
text on the Far East is probably
best known to students, his most
extensive work was the three-volume
"Diplomatic Relations Between the
United States and Japan."
A tribute to Dr. Treat's work, the
I F.I.D.A.C. award for the university
which had made the greatest con
| tribution to the study of the Far East
was presented to Stanford in 1934.
