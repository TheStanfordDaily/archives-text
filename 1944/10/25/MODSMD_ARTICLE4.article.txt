Present practice of the Army which !
| affords eligible 17-year-old high j
school graduates a chance to enlist j
in the reserve in order to have col- !
lege training at government expense
until their 18th birthday will be ter- j
minated with the beginning of the
new year, according to a War De
partment announcement received to- j
day by Colonel John R. Eden, Com
mandant of the Army Specialized
Training Program at Stanford Uni
-1 versity.
| Enlistments under the new ruling
| will not be made alter January 1,
; 1945, Colonel Eden stated, but it
| will be possible for otherwise eli
gible young men who can obtain
certificates from their high school
principals that they will graduate by J
the end of that month, or the first [
part of February, to enlist in the
Enlisted Reserve Corps, unassigned, j
prior to January 1 and prior to their j
graduation from high school.
Enlistments in the Air Corps En- !
listed Reserve will be open only to
those young men who participate in j
the ASTRP and who enlist prior to j
October 31, 1944, the recent an- I
nouncement stated.
Whether the program after the j
present limiting date of March 1 will J
again be made available for begin- !
ning terms after July 1, 1945, will
depend on availability of funds for
the new fiscal year, Colonel Eden j
stated.
