# Cardinals Plan Ghost Party
## 
### 
Cardinals last night sprung a sur
prise on the whole campus with the
I announcement that there would be
a Halloween party Friday night in
the Nitery—complete with ghosts,
apple-ducking and the traditional
j cider-and-doughnuts feed. Jim Rey
nolds, Cardinal mastermind, is in
! charge.
In keeping with the theme, jeans
1 will be worn, and square-dancing
: will take place intermittently
I throughout the evening. Singing,
I "string-eating" contests, and fortune
| telling will spark the entertainment;
I while Charlie Clark will head a pre-
I liminary program for presenting War
Chest winner certificates. Also plans
are afoot for ghost stories and a fire
| in the fireplace!
Rumor has it that "the goblins'll
t getcha if you don't turn out."
