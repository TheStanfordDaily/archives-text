ALLIED SUPREME HDQ, PARIS, Wed., Oct. 25—(U.P.)—Brit
ish Tommies fought their way into 'S-Hertogen-bosch Tuesday
and plunged through weak German defenses south of the city
for gains up to five miles on a twelve mile front, driving the
enemy into a giant Allies' trap to the west that might ultimately
yield seventy thousand captives.
