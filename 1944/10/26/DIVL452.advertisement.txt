Mica's special insulating qualities are mighty important in
communications equipment. No cquiialent exists, so >\ars
huge demands caused a critical shortage.
• Bell Telephone Laboratories' scientists were assigned the
ta*k of somehow finding more mica. They found it — in the
verv considerable amounts of raw mica which visual inspec
tion had rejected. By developing electrical apparatus to test
the two most important electrical properties, they increased
the usable amount of mica by half and so stretched current
supplies of mica to fill all military needs.
In many such ways the Bell System i* seizing the nation,
constantly meet ins the needs of our fighting forces for
J O D u
dependable communications.
