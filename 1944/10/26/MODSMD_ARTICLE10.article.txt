# Cardinals Flan Friday Party
## 
### 
With six living groups pledged to
contribute to the success of the eve
ning, the Cardinals last night com
pleted the organizational plans for
their all-campus, no date, rip-roar
ing Hallowe'en party.
'Ihe party is set for Friday night
from 8 to 11:30 in the Nitery. In
keeping with the theme, jeans will
be worn, and pumpkins (and other
things!) will be scattered about the
room by the official decorators from
Roble and Casa Ventura.
Charlie Clark has organized a pre
liminary program during which cer
tificates for the first living groups to
go 100 per cent for the War Fund
drive will be presented. Entertain
ment from then on is in the hands
of the Russell House women, who
have already organized a skit and a
trio, and promise a "boogie-woogie
man" on the piano plui; a spook story.
Fortune Telling
Fortune-telling booths will be in
front of the A.S.S.U. office, and two
"psychic-minded ones" will be there
to tell your future and collect yovir
money. Prices will be at a minimum,
with cider and doughnuts, handed
out from behind the Nitery coke
bar by Branner women, at only live
cents per serving.
Elm women are secretly chuckling
at some of the games they have or
ganizedâ€”games that promise maxi
mum entertainment and participa
tion for all. Funny prizes will be
given winners in each.
Intermittently during the evening
there will be community singing.
Duck for Apples
Men from Toyon will supervise
ducking for apples in big tubs of
water; ducking, it is hoped, will be
purely voluntary. Wherever it is
possible, the traditional Hallowe'en
games will be played.
Carol Hurwitz, newly elected Car
dinal member, has announced the
names of patronesses. They are Mrs.
Ella Jorgelesco, house mother at the
Chalet; Mrs. Isabel McCondrey from
the Theresa Russell house; and
Mrs. Carolyn Hall, Hurlburt House
mother.
Ed Luce will be in charge of po
lice and clean-up for the party.
As one Cardinal member so aptly
put it. "Girls, if you don't have one
of your own, come on over and
'haunt someone else's man.' Remem
ber, it's no-date, and Cardinals in
vites the who'.e campus to attend."
