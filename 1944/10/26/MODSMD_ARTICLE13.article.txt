# REGULATION AND MATURITY
## 
### 
During the next three weeks Social Regulations Tests v/ill be
given to all Stanford women. The regulations which govern the
women students were adopted because the women themselves
(ound a definite need for them. In order that so many women
may live together with the greatest possible harmony and the
least possible friction it is necessary to have some form of regu
lation. These regulations, therefore, were enacted by Women's
Conference and their enforcement was delegated to Women's
Council.
It is the personal responsibility of every woman student to know
'he regulations and to abide by them. Not knowing the regula
tions, knowing them but forgetting, or knowing them but ignor
ing them are egually serious. When you enter the University
you agree to uphold these regulations—if you do not do so, you
are not fulfilling your part of the agreement. It is a question
of maturity, and of citizenship.
The Social Regulations Tests are given so that you may check
upon your knowledge of the regulations. Only by knowing them,
understanding them, and abiding by them can you do your part
to keep them intact.
