Editor, Dear Sir:
This letter is written in an effort to bring to light and to clear
critical attention the conditions of the Women's Physical Educa
tion Dept. and Health Service. These two organizations affect
every woman in the University and there has been a great deal
Df unanalyzed rumor and grumbling about them. Some of this
talk has been somewhat malicious and not all of it has been
based on fact. Here then are the facts.
Men are allowed to be absent from their gym classes three
times each guarter, provided that they later make up these ab
sences. Makeups are done on an honor code system. Women's
rules provide that one unexcused absencc automatically flunks
•he student. Excuses must be obtained prior to class either in
rase of illness or in case the student has some sufficiently
important reason for missing the class. (Individual instructors
sometimes contravene these rules, however.) Except in case of
illness no makeups are allowed. 1
Men who are excused from P.E. because of illness are not re
quired to make up the classes that they miss. Women must
make up absences due to illness if over 20 per cent of the classes
are missed or they may take a straight C grade. Makeups for
classes missed because of illness must be done within the year
or the student receives an automatic flunk.
Students with a minus in a P.E. course, who are absent from
class for any other reason than illness (with excuse obtained
from Health Service) may have their registration cancelled. This
has been done. I do not know whether the men's P.E. Dept. has
a rule which parallels this one.
In the other comparisons, however, it is evident that the
women's rules are the more severe; whether they are unreason
ably so is a matter of personal judgment.
The Women's Health Service has been operating under dif
ficulties since the beginning of the war as have all clinics. How
ever, even prior to the war there was not complete satisfaction
with the treatment that the Service gave. By way of illustration
( quote three cases which have been told to me by the girls
nvolved.
The first girl broke her leg while skiing. The doctors at the
Service did not recognize the fact that the leg was fractured and
•mly X-rayed it at her insistence.
The second girl had a broken finger. The Health Service again
lid not realize there was a fracture and the finger was so poorly
fated that she can barely bend it after two years. Another doc
c to vhom she finally went immediately realized that the finger
lad been broken.
The third girl was treated for a cracked rib. When her symp
:o:ns persisted she went to another doctor who diagnosed her
oase as anemia.

There are many more stories, but to me they are heaisay. If
these stories of incompetency are true they should be told, for
poor medical service can be extremely dangerous, and it is as
dangerous to the reputation of the University as it is to the health
of the students.
My own recommendation is that the facts be investigated, and
then, if the Service is poor, some provision be made so that the
students who have serious or unusual symptoms can go to a
clinic where they can be treated by specialists in their types of
cases.
Yours truly,

sences. Makeups are done on an honor code system. Women's
rules provide that one unexcused absencc automatically flunks
•he student. Excuses must be obtained prior to class either in
rase of illness or in case the student has some sufficiently
important reason for missing the class. (Individual instructors
sometimes contravene these rules, however.) Except in case of
illness no makeups are allowed. 1
Men who are excused from P.E. because of illness are not re
quired to make up the classes that they miss. Women must
make up absences due to illness if over 20 per cent of the classes
are missed or they may take a straight C grade. Makeups for
classes missed because of illness must be done within the year
or the student receives an automatic flunk.
Students with a minus in a P.E. course, who are absent from
class for any other reason than illness (with excuse obtained
from Health Service) may have their registration cancelled. This
has been done. I do not know whether the men's P.E. Dept. has
a rule which parallels this one.
In the other comparisons, however, it is evident that the
women's rules are the more severe; whether they are unreason
ably so is a matter of personal judgment.
The Women's Health Service has been operating under dif
ficulties since the beginning of the war as have all clinics. How
ever, even prior to the war there was not complete satisfaction
with the treatment that the Service gave. By way of illustration
( quote three cases which have been told to me by the girls
nvolved.
The first girl broke her leg while skiing. The doctors at the
Service did not recognize the fact that the leg was fractured and
•mly X-rayed it at her insistence.
The second girl had a broken finger. The Health Service again
lid not realize there was a fracture and the finger was so poorly
fated that she can barely bend it after two years. Another doc
c to vhom she finally went immediately realized that the finger
lad been broken.
The third girl was treated for a cracked rib. When her symp
:o:ns persisted she went to another doctor who diagnosed her
oase as anemia.

There are many more stories, but to me they are heaisay. If
these stories of incompetency are true they should be told, for
poor medical service can be extremely dangerous, and it is as
dangerous to the reputation of the University as it is to the health
of the students.
My own recommendation is that the facts be investigated, and
then, if the Service is poor, some provision be made so that the
students who have serious or unusual symptoms can go to a
clinic where they can be treated by specialists in their types of
cases.
