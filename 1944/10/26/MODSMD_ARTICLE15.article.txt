In order to fully understand the moves leading up to the abortive in- I
vasion of the Sibuyan Sea, it is best to look at the whole thing through i
the eyes of the Japanese High Command. It was their idea and their i
failure.
The first thing it found was its fleet being attacked between Formosa

and Luzon by heavy American naval 4
units. They decided, and quite prop
erly, to order a reconaissanee, and a j
few ships made this, drawing back j
out of range as soon as they saw our j
large sea forces in this region.
Philippine Counter
The next occurrence was General J
Mac Arthur's invasion of the Philip- i
pines, which was a strike against the
western fringes of the Sibuyan Sea,
or the waters between Luzon and
Mindanao, dotted with the many is
lands of the central Philippines. The
only hope the enemy seemed to have
held in its mind was that our forces
were divided, and, if he could mass
a large enough task force in a quick
enough period, he could beat us in
detail. However the first factor op
erating against him was the degiee
| to which Admiral Halsey was pin
! ning him down, and he could not di-
I vert large enough forces from be-
I tween Luzon and Formosa for the
I operation.
He did, however, manage to drag
i up ships from the South Pacific,
I probably from the area around
Singapore. He threw these two col
umns in divided, one striking into
the central Philippines from the
south, the other from the north. He
also ordered whatever he had be
tween Luzon and Formosa to strike
out in the area of the latter, thus
hoping to fully engage Admiral Hal
sey and keep him from diverting too
much to General Mac Arthur's aid if
the latter's position should become
to difficult.
Tactical Blunder
The second factor operating against
the enemy was a blunder in tactical
conception. He did right in diverting
forces to the Philippines, but he
should have used them to defend the
narrow channels of the Sibuyan Sea,
and not attack through them, since
the area was not.wide enough for
full deployment of large lines of
columns. This was enough, and we
struck our blow. Both columns in
the Philippines were routed, while
the one in the north is still hanging
on to its organization.

Tactical Blunder
The second factor operating against
the enemy was a blunder in tactical
conception. He did right in diverting
forces to the Philippines, but he
should have used them to defend the
narrow channels of the Sibuyan Sea,
and not attack through them, since
the area was not.wide enough for
full deployment of large lines of
columns. This was enough, and we
struck our blow. Both columns in
the Philippines were routed, while
the one in the north is still hanging
on to its organization.
In order to fully understand the moves leading up to the abortive in- I
vasion of the Sibuyan Sea, it is best to look at the whole thing through i
the eyes of the Japanese High Command. It was their idea and their i
failure.
The first thing it found was its fleet being attacked between Formosa

and Luzon by heavy American naval 4
units. They decided, and quite prop
erly, to order a reconaissanee, and a j
few ships made this, drawing back j
out of range as soon as they saw our j
large sea forces in this region.
Philippine Counter
The next occurrence was General J
Mac Arthur's invasion of the Philip- i
pines, which was a strike against the
western fringes of the Sibuyan Sea,
or the waters between Luzon and
Mindanao, dotted with the many is
lands of the central Philippines. The
only hope the enemy seemed to have
held in its mind was that our forces
were divided, and, if he could mass
a large enough task force in a quick
enough period, he could beat us in
detail. However the first factor op
erating against him was the degiee
| to which Admiral Halsey was pin
! ning him down, and he could not di-
I vert large enough forces from be-
I tween Luzon and Formosa for the
I operation.
He did, however, manage to drag
i up ships from the South Pacific,
I probably from the area around
Singapore. He threw these two col
umns in divided, one striking into
the central Philippines from the
south, the other from the north. He
also ordered whatever he had be
tween Luzon and Formosa to strike
out in the area of the latter, thus
hoping to fully engage Admiral Hal
sey and keep him from diverting too
much to General Mac Arthur's aid if
the latter's position should become
to difficult.
