# Tyler, Firehouse Ready For Action
## 
### 
According to Willie Davies, cap
tain of Tyler, "prospects are high,
but we will do our talking later."
And from the looks of things, the
Tyler boys will do plenty of talking.
Not satisfied with putting out a six
man squad, they have organized two
squads, both of which are fast and
powerful.
Among the six backs that they
have to choose from are George
Westfall (no relation to all-Ameri
can Bob of Michigan), Tom Eagan,
John 8011, Wendel Lehn, Dennis Fox,
and Captain Willie Davies. Of these
men, three have seen considerable
action. Eagan was one of the "big
tuns" in his school at Stockton. Last
quarter, he led his team in baseball
and basketball.
Fox and Davies
Dennis Fox, tall and powerful,
went to Menlo before attending
Stanford. Davies', from all indica
tions, will be "the'' man and possibly
one of the most dangerous backs in
the League. He saw his action at
Brown Military Academy, where he
played first string.
Linemen Don Hableau, Bob Slade,
Fargo Wells, Bob Clayton, John
Glather, and George lokimedes pre
sent a formidable array of talent.
Experience, however, is sadly lack
ing.
Firehousc Powerful
Hoping to continue the fine record
that they have set in the last few
years, the men of the Firehouse are
ready once again to take to the field.
Leading the team is Tom Ashley, a
member of last year's team.
Along with Ashley are Bob Nes
bit. Bob Howell, Woody Hansen,
Luke Pitts, and Marshall Hjelde. All
these men have seen plenty of previ
ous action. Hjelte got his football
experience in Hawaii, where foot
ball is football, and only the strong
est survive.
As yet, the Firehouse squad has
had very little practice and positions
have not been assigned.

ready once again to take to the field.
Leading the team is Tom Ashley, a
member of last year's team.
Along with Ashley are Bob Nes
bit. Bob Howell, Woody Hansen,
Luke Pitts, and Marshall Hjelde. All
these men have seen plenty of previ
ous action. Hjelte got his football
experience in Hawaii, where foot
ball is football, and only the strong
est survive.
As yet, the Firehouse squad has
had very little practice and positions
have not been assigned.
