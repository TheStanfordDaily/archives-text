# Washington Grids Awaiting Opener
## 
### 
"When it comes to alternating foot
ball players around, Washington will
take the cake," says Tom Fishel, who
is working his Washington Hall six
man grid team into shape for next
week's opening.
With a whole host of promising
stars, Fishel names Jim Reynolds
and Dave Morledgc as the most ex
perienced veterans who will lead a
backfield with Buddy Elder, and
Henry Ponsford as able contenders.
A threatening attack with Fishel do
ing some vicious blocking is definite
ly on tap.
Contesting for end spots are War
ren Brown, Don Green, Bill Barber,
and Bob Davis. The latter two, with
the size and experience for the wing
positions, may be the important cogs
in the Washington machine.
Dick Heppe, Dick Fayram, and Bill
Byrne will vie for ball-snapping hon
ors. Heppe, a stout defensive player,
looms as a potential offensive threat.
Fishel went on to say that experi
ence and weight will make Washing
ton a tough team to beat when play
gets underway.
