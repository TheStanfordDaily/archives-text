Talking about football, one of the
best games in the nation will be
played Sunday at Kezar Stadium in
San Francisco, when undefeated
Fourth Air Force pits its strength
against Lt. Jules Sike's St. Marys
Pre-Flight. Before the last few
.games, the contest looked like a
walkaway for the Army Flyers, but

1 that is no longer the case.
While the Flyers were putting
away all opposition, with the excep
tion of the Coast Guard, Pre-Flight
j was getting its wings knocked down
i as well as losing its best players.
| But during the USC game, St. Marys
| unleashed a new threat, narrtely Jul
j ius Davies, a southerner. Since that
: game, the Pre-Flight boys have been
i red hot. ..They dumped a highly po

1 tent UCLA eleven last Saturday with
very little effort. And it was Julius
. that did the dumping, Now they are
banking on little Julius to make it a
| repeat performance.
Of course, Fourth Air Force is not |
; shivering in its boots, and probably j
j will never know what fear is as long j
j as it has an all-American back play- !
; ing'second string. This man is Jimmy
| Nelson, â€ž ex of Alabama's Crimson
| Tide, who alternates with Jack
j Jacobs, all-American from Okla- !
hcma. As for the rest of the back- '
! field, Major Paul Schissler has Bob j
1 DeFruiter, Sal Rosato, Vic Spadac- i

cini (Minnesota great of Bernie Beir
man), and others.
Among the linesmen are Hank
Norberg, one of Stanford's best endi
of a fi;\v years back, Woody Strode
i UCLA flash, and Dk'k Barwegan oi
Purdue.
j The "poor" Pre-Flighters can'i
j boast of such names, but any team
| that can hold USC to six points
j might know nothing, but must havt
j something.
However, we're not the types tc
1 stick our necks out.
