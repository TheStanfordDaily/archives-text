# Our Hasher Sez:

### Joe Sher 
The chief feature at the "Shaugh- I
nessy Shambles" next week, accord
ing to the hashers' grapevine, is i
dedicated to the Stanford Students I
and their various activities. This I
gripping epic of Farm life and hu- I
man frailties takes place in practi
cally any of the play spots in the !
surrounding area—Belts, Rossotti's
Park, or some other haven of rest
and relaxation (to say nothing of
refreshments). The title of this saga
is "They Fried by Night" and is ex
pected to meet with the approval of
every living person and Bower, Daily
movie critic.
Definition of the week: "Spectacle." ;
A spectacle is what an optician's ,
daughter makes of herself with two i
glasses.
The door of one of the Stanford j
residences opens, a beautiful girl
(this is a fable of the Farm) steps
forth escorted by a Navy man clad
in a smooth black uniform. This
very attractive couple walk down the
stairs to the powerful vehicle wait
ing at the curb, and this is where our
story begins, for here stands the new
est addition to the smooth fleet of
cars which graces the campus. This
venerable and dilapidated hack is
the proud possession of the Gerona

gang, a prominent group of BWOC's I
and movers on campus. To describe !
this apparition calls for an imagina
tion beyond the realm of reality and
so I will not attempt to go into the
finer details. I will only extend here
a timely warning to an unaware stu
dent, so that when you hear a ghost
ly rattling and clanging, you will
know it is not the sturdy little local
off the track but only "Gassy Gussy"
carrying hard studying and hard
working medical students out on an
evening of good clean fun.
Conversation between a member j
of the local police force and a typi- j
cal Stanford student: "Offisser, you !
can't arrest me for having six bottles j
of beer." Officer, in stern and relent- j
less tone: "Why not, son?" "Well," |
came back the brilliant answer, "six |
bottles are not enough to make a j
case."
Four-for-forty is not a joke, so j
you can hear the Stanford students !
say, "Watch our smoke." This poetry I
sounds like hell, but I think you get I
the idea. Let's skip a few glasses of
liquid celery and malt, smoke a few
less El Hackos (Spanish for the
hack), and dig into that sock for
those four lettuce leaves to give the
forty all the four's they can use. .

The door of one of the Stanford j
residences opens, a beautiful girl
(this is a fable of the Farm) steps
forth escorted by a Navy man clad
in a smooth black uniform. This
very attractive couple walk down the
stairs to the powerful vehicle wait
ing at the curb, and this is where our
story begins, for here stands the new
est addition to the smooth fleet of
cars which graces the campus. This
venerable and dilapidated hack is
the proud possession of the Gerona

gang, a prominent group of BWOC's I
and movers on campus. To describe !
this apparition calls for an imagina
tion beyond the realm of reality and
so I will not attempt to go into the
finer details. I will only extend here
a timely warning to an unaware stu
dent, so that when you hear a ghost
ly rattling and clanging, you will
know it is not the sturdy little local
off the track but only "Gassy Gussy"
carrying hard studying and hard
working medical students out on an
evening of good clean fun.
Conversation between a member j
of the local police force and a typi- j
cal Stanford student: "Offisser, you !
can't arrest me for having six bottles j
of beer." Officer, in stern and relent- j
less tone: "Why not, son?" "Well," |
came back the brilliant answer, "six |
bottles are not enough to make a j
case."
Four-for-forty is not a joke, so j
you can hear the Stanford students !
say, "Watch our smoke." This poetry I
sounds like hell, but I think you get I
the idea. Let's skip a few glasses of
liquid celery and malt, smoke a few
less El Hackos (Spanish for the
hack), and dig into that sock for
those four lettuce leaves to give the
forty all the four's they can use. .
The chief feature at the "Shaugh- I
nessy Shambles" next week, accord
ing to the hashers' grapevine, is i
dedicated to the Stanford Students I
and their various activities. This I
gripping epic of Farm life and hu- I
man frailties takes place in practi
cally any of the play spots in the !
surrounding area—Belts, Rossotti's
Park, or some other haven of rest
and relaxation (to say nothing of
refreshments). The title of this saga
is "They Fried by Night" and is ex
pected to meet with the approval of
every living person and Bower, Daily
movie critic.
Definition of the week: "Spectacle." ;
A spectacle is what an optician's ,
