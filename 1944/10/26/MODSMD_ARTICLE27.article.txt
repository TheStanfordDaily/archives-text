This week the Quad office will be
undergoing a revolutionary process,

—paint. When a lull came in one of
the recent Quad meetings, some one
suggested in a soft voice that a paint
job would do no drastic harm to the
office.

Appointments for senior pictures
can still he made at the Quad
office from 1 to 4 o'clock Monday
through Friday. The pictures will
be taken from October 110 to De
cerning* 11. Bring $1 with you
when you come.

This suggestion was met with im
mediate response on the part of
Mickey Magee. Margery Johnson,
Jane Irwin, Virginia Walker. Jeanne
Soule, Hayes Hunter, and the rest of
the Quad staff.

The dilapidated old building will ,
be scoured from top to bottom before j
the real job pets underway. Relies
and cobwebs that have remained un- !
touched in the corners for decades j
will be gently but thoroughly re- j
moved.
The entire Quad staff, including
tryoutees, will then begin to paint
with the zeal that has always typi
fied those who work on the year
book. Apple-green paint will be fly
ing everywhere, so if you're showing
friends around the campus this week,
beware of the Quad office.
We shall await with great expec
tation this addition to the Quad, so
if you are interested in working on
the yearbook—and also swing a
mean paint brush —show up at the
Quad office for the festivity of.the
week.
