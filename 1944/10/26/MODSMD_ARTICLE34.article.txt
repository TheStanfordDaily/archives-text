# BULL SESSION

### Dick Crane 
How about a buck for this? How about five dollars for that?
Money! Money! Money! My God! sometimes it's enough to
drive you crazy, but according to economic theory you have to
take the "bitter with the sweet," and as everyone is overloaded
with the filthy lucre these days, there has to be some way to get
it away from the populace. What am I saying?
So today readers, I am going to attempt to touch your charitable
souls, and have you reach down into your pockets and come up
with money instead of moths. What's it for? Why the War Fund
Drive of course.
Bull Session for today isn't directed to the contributors of the
drive, who have already dug deep into their jeans and come up
with the eguivalent of beer after beer. On the other hand, today's
article is for the direct purpose of shaming those non-contributors
who think that a couple of lousy dollars is more important to
them, than for example, the forty Stanford students, who are now
prisoners of war. You may say, that's all we have heard since
we have been at Stanford, and we are tired of it. I grant that you
are tired of hearing all this, but the main reason for it, is be
cause all of these drives are for a good cause, and it bothers
your conscience if you don't contribute.
I know you have other arguments, one of them being that it is
against your principles to be coerced into contributing, but you
know damn well if you wern't so "chintzy," there wouldn't be
a need for using this type of persuasion.
Also the argument that you don't like to contribute to foreign
relief, is merely a way to "duck" the issue. This University has
undoubtedly more wealth per person, than most of the colleges
and universities in this country, and if you observe the people
around you, or yourself, you will notice that you lead a pretty
soft life. It certainly isn't going to be much of a sacrifice to give
a small amount to save perhaps a human life, be it Chinese,
Italian, or what have you.
This is going to be all the chastizing for today, I just wanted to
remind you of a few things before you say you won't contribute
to this War Fund Drive. I think I have refuted any argument
that you can make. In ending today's session, I think you will
agree with me when I say the word "give" is synonymous with
"live."

and universities in this country, and if you observe the people
around you, or yourself, you will notice that you lead a pretty
soft life. It certainly isn't going to be much of a sacrifice to give
a small amount to save perhaps a human life, be it Chinese,
Italian, or what have you.
This is going to be all the chastizing for today, I just wanted to
remind you of a few things before you say you won't contribute
to this War Fund Drive. I think I have refuted any argument
that you can make. In ending today's session, I think you will
agree with me when I say the word "give" is synonymous with
"live."
How about a buck for this? How about five dollars for that?
Money! Money! Money! My God! sometimes it's enough to
drive you crazy, but according to economic theory you have to
take the "bitter with the sweet," and as everyone is overloaded
with the filthy lucre these days, there has to be some way to get
it away from the populace. What am I saying?
So today readers, I am going to attempt to touch your charitable
souls, and have you reach down into your pockets and come up
with money instead of moths. What's it for? Why the War Fund
Drive of course.
Bull Session for today isn't directed to the contributors of the
drive, who have already dug deep into their jeans and come up
with the eguivalent of beer after beer. On the other hand, today's
article is for the direct purpose of shaming those non-contributors
who think that a couple of lousy dollars is more important to
them, than for example, the forty Stanford students, who are now
prisoners of war. You may say, that's all we have heard since
we have been at Stanford, and we are tired of it. I grant that you
are tired of hearing all this, but the main reason for it, is be
cause all of these drives are for a good cause, and it bothers
your conscience if you don't contribute.
I know you have other arguments, one of them being that it is
against your principles to be coerced into contributing, but you
know damn well if you wern't so "chintzy," there wouldn't be
a need for using this type of persuasion.
Also the argument that you don't like to contribute to foreign
relief, is merely a way to "duck" the issue. This University has
undoubtedly more wealth per person, than most of the colleges
and universities in this country, and if you observe the people
around you, or yourself, you will notice that you lead a pretty
soft life. It certainly isn't going to be much of a sacrifice to give
a small amount to save perhaps a human life, be it Chinese,
