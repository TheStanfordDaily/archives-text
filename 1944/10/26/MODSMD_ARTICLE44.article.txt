## 
### 
Dr. O. Andersen, General Director
t of the School of Health, stated that
! 'he athletic requirements for civilian
students would also apply to veter
ans, unless (hey are physically dis
abled and have a medical excuse.
He further added (hat the Univer
l sity feels that this physical training,
which is required in all but the last
quarter for undergraduate students,
would be a great asset in the recon
ditioning of these soldiers.
Last quarter, about seventy veter
ans. stationed at Dibble Hospital,
used the swimming pools and other
facilities. This proved to be very
helpful.
