## 
### 
J. Hugh Jackson, Dean, Graduate ]
School of' Business, and Frank F. j
Walker, Financial Vice-President of
Stanford, were among the speakers
at the seventh annual meeting of the
Western Association of College and
University Business Officers held Oc- !
tober 23 and 24 in San Francisco.
"We will not in all probability find |
ourselves as unprepared for the re
turn trip to peacetime production as j
we were on the outward bound voy- <
age following Pearl Harbor," de- l
clared Walker in his address en- I
titled "Investment and the Infla- I
tionary Trend."
jjoace Plans
Walker explained this statement
by reminding his audience of the !
Dumbarton Oaks Conference and the
Bretton Woods Conference, in which |
plans for future peace and matters
of international finance were dis- j
cussed.
Under the circumstances, Walker
declared that it seems appropriate
for a Conference of Business Officers
to "examine briefly some of the ma
jor economic probabilities for the
future and their possible impact
upon our institutions."
Big Business
Walker went on to explain that the
increase in enrollment and total pop
ulation of the average university has
caused such an expansion in univer
sity expenditures and capital as to
put them in the "big business" cate
gory.
Universities cannot escape from |
being influenced by the economic j
conditions of the country, for "The
abiility to collect sufficient taxes to
support our existing tax-supported
universities or to collect high enough
tuition fees together with a,n ade
quate flow of gifts to maintain our
endowed institutions rests on our j
national income," declared Walker.
Walker estimated that the post- i
war tax burden on the United States j
would be between 18 and 22 billions. |
In contemplating this amount, the j
speaker looked with apprehension as
i the effect on our currency and |
mndard of living even if it is con- I
ceded that our national income may
run somewhat over 100 billions.
Said he,"The taxes are definite but i
the income i.s not."
Revenue Difficulties
"In the long run our currency will i
be no sounder than the conditions ol j
our national budget and the rela- I
tionship between income and taxes, i
irrespective of whether or not we !
have 20 billions in gold buried in >
our vaults as a backing for the dol- j
lar," he commented.
The speaker continued by saying j
that with a depreciated dollar the j
tax - supported institutions would
constantly find the revenues allotted
them insufficient to cover the costs. I
The impoverishment of educators
and the destruction of institutions of
higher learning is one of the certain
and tragic consequences of an un- j
sound and depreciating currency
system," states Walker.
Crystal Gazer
Gazing into his "crystal ball," as
he put it, Mr. Walker declared that
he sees two rather clearly defined !
economic periods in the next three to
ten years, namely, the replacement
and foreign rehabilitation period and
then a less active period based on
(he exchange of goods needed cur-'
rently.
At the conclusion of the last phase,
alker foresees a depression which !
will be, if and and when it arrives, j
a real trial to universities. "It will }
test our managerial foresight as well
as our finances, but the majority of
universities will endure—there can
be no doubt," concluded the speaker.
Jackson Speaks
J. Hugh Jackson, in his speech on !
"Accounting—A Tool of Educational I

\ Adininistratioh," declared that the i
I success of a college or university is |
generally measured in terms ot its
service to the community.
The speaker dealt with the basis of
j organization of the various schools !
1 and universities and explained the
! organization of Stanford in particu- !
i lar.
"It would appear to me that ac- j
i counting has two main functions —to
! |
j furnish information and to provide :
\ adequate control. In an educational
I institution of collegiate grade the ;
, accounting system must be designed
and carried out so that it will pro- [
duce prompt, accurate, and perma
nent records of all the financial fac
! tors," declared Jackson.
Accounting Functions
Concerning the first of these two !
j functions, Jackson stated that an el- j
j l'ective accounting system may be
said to have two major tasks —to
supply data for reports concerning
the financial conditions and opera
tions of the institution, and to deter
mine the fidelity of the officers re
sponsible for handling the institu
tional funds.
"It is even more important that the
top management group be furnished
with data which will enable it to ex
ercise sound financial and operative
control. This, obviously, is accom
plished through the budget which is
probably the most important element
in the entire control mechanism," ac
cording to Jackson.
!
The speaker concluded his remarks
j by saying that the accounting mate
j rial should be translated into the
language of laymen—because "how
ever great a world scholar the presi
dent of a university may be, it is
probable that he is a mere layman
in the field of accounting."

declared that it seems appropriate
for a Conference of Business Officers
to "examine briefly some of the ma
jor economic probabilities for the
future and their possible impact
upon our institutions."
Big Business
Walker went on to explain that the
increase in enrollment and total pop
ulation of the average university has
caused such an expansion in univer
sity expenditures and capital as to
put them in the "big business" cate
gory.
Universities cannot escape from |
being influenced by the economic j
conditions of the country, for "The
abiility to collect sufficient taxes to
support our existing tax-supported
universities or to collect high enough
tuition fees together with a,n ade
quate flow of gifts to maintain our
endowed institutions rests on our j
national income," declared Walker.
Walker estimated that the post- i
war tax burden on the United States j
would be between 18 and 22 billions. |
In contemplating this amount, the j
speaker looked with apprehension as
i the effect on our currency and |
mndard of living even if it is con- I
ceded that our national income may
run somewhat over 100 billions.
Said he,"The taxes are definite but i
the income i.s not."
Revenue Difficulties
"In the long run our currency will i
be no sounder than the conditions ol j
our national budget and the rela- I
tionship between income and taxes, i
irrespective of whether or not we !
have 20 billions in gold buried in >
our vaults as a backing for the dol- j
lar," he commented.
The speaker continued by saying j
that with a depreciated dollar the j
tax - supported institutions would
constantly find the revenues allotted
them insufficient to cover the costs. I
The impoverishment of educators
and the destruction of institutions of
higher learning is one of the certain
and tragic consequences of an un- j
sound and depreciating currency
system," states Walker.
Crystal Gazer
Gazing into his "crystal ball," as
he put it, Mr. Walker declared that
he sees two rather clearly defined !
economic periods in the next three to
ten years, namely, the replacement
and foreign rehabilitation period and
then a less active period based on
(he exchange of goods needed cur-'
rently.
At the conclusion of the last phase,
alker foresees a depression which !
will be, if and and when it arrives, j
a real trial to universities. "It will }
test our managerial foresight as well
as our finances, but the majority of
universities will endure—there can
be no doubt," concluded the speaker.
Jackson Speaks
J. Hugh Jackson, in his speech on !
"Accounting—A Tool of Educational I

\ Adininistratioh," declared that the i
I success of a college or university is |
generally measured in terms ot its
service to the community.
The speaker dealt with the basis of
j organization of the various schools !
1 and universities and explained the
! organization of Stanford in particu- !
i lar.
"It would appear to me that ac- j
i counting has two main functions —to
! |
j furnish information and to provide :
\ adequate control. In an educational
I institution of collegiate grade the ;
, accounting system must be designed
and carried out so that it will pro- [
duce prompt, accurate, and perma
nent records of all the financial fac
! tors," declared Jackson.
Accounting Functions
Concerning the first of these two !
j functions, Jackson stated that an el- j
j l'ective accounting system may be
said to have two major tasks —to
supply data for reports concerning
the financial conditions and opera
tions of the institution, and to deter
mine the fidelity of the officers re
sponsible for handling the institu
tional funds.
"It is even more important that the
top management group be furnished
with data which will enable it to ex
ercise sound financial and operative
control. This, obviously, is accom
plished through the budget which is
probably the most important element
in the entire control mechanism," ac
cording to Jackson.
!
The speaker concluded his remarks
j by saying that the accounting mate
j rial should be translated into the
language of laymen—because "how
ever great a world scholar the presi
dent of a university may be, it is
probable that he is a mere layman
in the field of accounting."

In contemplating this amount, the j
speaker looked with apprehension as
i the effect on our currency and |
mndard of living even if it is con- I
ceded that our national income may
run somewhat over 100 billions.
Said he,"The taxes are definite but i
the income i.s not."
Revenue Difficulties
"In the long run our currency will i
be no sounder than the conditions ol j
our national budget and the rela- I
tionship between income and taxes, i
irrespective of whether or not we !
have 20 billions in gold buried in >
our vaults as a backing for the dol- j
lar," he commented.
The speaker continued by saying j
that with a depreciated dollar the j
tax - supported institutions would
constantly find the revenues allotted
them insufficient to cover the costs. I
The impoverishment of educators
and the destruction of institutions of
higher learning is one of the certain
and tragic consequences of an un- j
sound and depreciating currency
system," states Walker.
Crystal Gazer
Gazing into his "crystal ball," as
he put it, Mr. Walker declared that
he sees two rather clearly defined !
economic periods in the next three to
ten years, namely, the replacement
and foreign rehabilitation period and
then a less active period based on
(he exchange of goods needed cur-'
rently.
At the conclusion of the last phase,
alker foresees a depression which !
will be, if and and when it arrives, j
a real trial to universities. "It will }
test our managerial foresight as well
as our finances, but the majority of
universities will endure—there can
be no doubt," concluded the speaker.
Jackson Speaks
J. Hugh Jackson, in his speech on !
"Accounting—A Tool of Educational I

\ Adininistratioh," declared that the i
I success of a college or university is |
generally measured in terms ot its
service to the community.
The speaker dealt with the basis of
j organization of the various schools !
1 and universities and explained the
! organization of Stanford in particu- !
i lar.
"It would appear to me that ac- j
i counting has two main functions —to
! |
j furnish information and to provide :
\ adequate control. In an educational
I institution of collegiate grade the ;
, accounting system must be designed
and carried out so that it will pro- [
duce prompt, accurate, and perma
nent records of all the financial fac
! tors," declared Jackson.
Accounting Functions
Concerning the first of these two !
j functions, Jackson stated that an el- j
j l'ective accounting system may be
said to have two major tasks —to
supply data for reports concerning
the financial conditions and opera
tions of the institution, and to deter
mine the fidelity of the officers re
sponsible for handling the institu
tional funds.
"It is even more important that the
top management group be furnished
with data which will enable it to ex
ercise sound financial and operative
control. This, obviously, is accom
plished through the budget which is
probably the most important element
in the entire control mechanism," ac
cording to Jackson.
!
The speaker concluded his remarks
j by saying that the accounting mate
j rial should be translated into the
language of laymen—because "how
ever great a world scholar the presi
dent of a university may be, it is
probable that he is a mere layman
in the field of accounting."
J. Hugh Jackson, Dean, Graduate ]
School of' Business, and Frank F. j
Walker, Financial Vice-President of
Stanford, were among the speakers
at the seventh annual meeting of the
Western Association of College and
University Business Officers held Oc- !
tober 23 and 24 in San Francisco.
"We will not in all probability find |
ourselves as unprepared for the re
turn trip to peacetime production as j
we were on the outward bound voy- <
age following Pearl Harbor," de- l
clared Walker in his address en- I
titled "Investment and the Infla- I
tionary Trend."
jjoace Plans
Walker explained this statement
by reminding his audience of the !
Dumbarton Oaks Conference and the
Bretton Woods Conference, in which |
plans for future peace and matters
of international finance were dis- j
cussed.
Under the circumstances, Walker
declared that it seems appropriate
for a Conference of Business Officers
to "examine briefly some of the ma
jor economic probabilities for the
future and their possible impact
upon our institutions."
Big Business
Walker went on to explain that the
increase in enrollment and total pop
ulation of the average university has
caused such an expansion in univer
sity expenditures and capital as to
put them in the "big business" cate
gory.
Universities cannot escape from |
being influenced by the economic j
conditions of the country, for "The
abiility to collect sufficient taxes to
support our existing tax-supported
universities or to collect high enough
tuition fees together with a,n ade
quate flow of gifts to maintain our
endowed institutions rests on our j
national income," declared Walker.
Walker estimated that the post- i
war tax burden on the United States j
would be between 18 and 22 billions. |
