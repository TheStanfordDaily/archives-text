### GLORIA BROOKS 
(Editorial note: This is the third in a series of heads of departments.)
"Stanford is famous for its trained administrators who have gone from
here to help improve our educational system in all parts of the country,"
said Lucien B. Kinney, Acting Dean of the School of Education in an inter
view wtih the Daily. Pointing to an outline map of the United States with
radiating lines showing our spheres of influence, he said that Stanford

alumnae in the Education
merit, now numbering 6,000, have j
concentrated principally in the East
with 43 administrators in New York
alone.
It was the late Dean of Education,
Elwood P. Cubberley, who gave 35 ,
years of service to Stanford and do- ;
nated the new Education Building ■
in 1933 who made Stanford a leader
in the educational field. He believed, 1
said Dr. Kinney, that we should make
the administration of schools a pro
fession ,and that we should regard
the school superintendent as a lead- j
ing member of the community and
not .... Dr. Kinney smiled, re
memberiug perhaps his own experi
ence .... a cross between a Sunday
.sehool teacher and a politician. From
its early days Stanford has been a
leading center of thinking on school
administration and educational guid
ance, and the extensive program of
fered today which is a far cry from
the early department of '"The Art
and History of Education," reflects j
the progress we have made as a
nation in education.
Effect of War
Dr. Kinney told how the war had
curtailed the number of students in
the department and caused a short- ;
age of professors. It is a tribute to j
their skill that so many professors !
have been called into government j
research on educational problems. |
Dean Grayson Kefauver who is on !
leave for work in international edu- !
cation, recently returned from Lon- I
don to report to the U.S. State De- j
partment on educational reconstruc- J
tion plans. A leader also in the field j
of educational guidance, he has writ
ten a book on that topic. According \
to Dr. Kinney, Stanford has made
outstanding contributions in the field
of guidance as well as administra- j
tion.
Reorganization
Under its higher education pro- j
gram Stanford is to organize its field
of college teaching and administra- ;
tion. William Cowley, President of
Hamilton College will replace Alvin
Eurich, Vice-President, in this im
portant field this spring.
The student enrollment in the i
School has changed considerably, j
according to Dr. Kinney. Where for

merly there were a number of men
majoring in the fields of physical
education, science, mathmatics, etc.,
there are now only a lew girls. Dr.
Kinney advises girls who are inter
ested in teaching these courses to
take advantage of the great oppor
tunities, for it will take a long time
after the war to make up the deficit
of teachers. Most unchanged by the
war are the English and Social Stud
ies departments which have 20 stu
dents each. There are 70 enrolled in
the secondary education division.
Divisions Listed
For the benefit of those who may
be a little confused by the various
divisions of the Education Depart
ment. there are 5 main groupings:
(1) Courses of study for teachers in
secondary school. (2) Curriculum for
college teachers. (3) College adminis
tration and guidance, educational
psychology and hygiene. (4) Special
staff as directors of research, rural
and city supervisors, etc. (5) Field of
Administration. •

Dr. Kinney who has been here
since the summer of 1940 became
Acting Dean in January of '43 when
Dean Kefauver took a leave of ab
sence. He received his degree at the
University of Minnesota where he
taught in the School of Education.
From there he went to the State
Teachers College in Osswego. N.Y U
as registrar and head of the mathe
matics department. His special field
is educational psychology and mathe
matics. and he has written a number
of books on the latter.

"Stanford is famous for its trained administrators who have gone from
here to help improve our educational system in all parts of the country,"
said Lucien B. Kinney, Acting Dean of the School of Education in an inter

radiating lines showing our spheres of influence, he said that Stanford

alumnae in the Education

Elwood P. Cubberley, who gave 35 ,
years of service to Stanford and do- ;
nated the new Education Building ■
in 1933 who made Stanford a leader
in the educational field. He believed, 1

Effect of War
Dr. Kinney told how the war had
curtailed the number of students in
the department and caused a short- ;
age of professors. It is a tribute to j
their skill that so many professors !
have been called into government j
research on educational problems. |

of educational guidance, he has writ
ten a book on that topic. According \
to Dr. Kinney, Stanford has made
outstanding contributions in the field
of guidance as well as administra- j
tion.
Reorganization
Under its higher education pro- j
gram Stanford is to organize its field
of college teaching and administra- ;
tion. William Cowley, President of
Hamilton College will replace Alvin
Eurich, Vice-President, in this im
portant field this spring.
The student enrollment in the i
School has changed considerably, j
according to Dr. Kinney. Where for

merly there were a number of men
majoring in the fields of physical
education, science, mathmatics, etc.,
there are now only a lew girls. Dr.
Kinney advises girls who are inter
ested in teaching these courses to
take advantage of the great oppor
tunities, for it will take a long time
after the war to make up the deficit
of teachers. Most unchanged by the

majoring in the fields of physical
education, science, mathmatics, etc.,
there are now only a lew girls. Dr.
Kinney advises girls who are inter
ested in teaching these courses to
take advantage of the great oppor
tunities, for it will take a long time
after the war to make up the deficit
of teachers. Most unchanged by the
war are the English and Social Stud
ies departments which have 20 stu
dents each. There are 70 enrolled in
the secondary education division.

(Editorial note: This is the third in a series of heads of departments.)
"Stanford is famous for its trained administrators who have gone from
here to help improve our educational system in all parts of the country,"
said Lucien B. Kinney, Acting Dean of the School of Education in an inter
view wtih the Daily. Pointing to an outline map of the United States with
radiating lines showing our spheres of influence, he said that Stanford

alumnae in the Education
merit, now numbering 6,000, have j
concentrated principally in the East
with 43 administrators in New York
alone.
It was the late Dean of Education,
Elwood P. Cubberley, who gave 35 ,
years of service to Stanford and do- ;
nated the new Education Building ■
in 1933 who made Stanford a leader
in the educational field. He believed, 1
said Dr. Kinney, that we should make
the administration of schools a pro
fession ,and that we should regard
the school superintendent as a lead- j
ing member of the community and
not .... Dr. Kinney smiled, re
memberiug perhaps his own experi
ence .... a cross between a Sunday
.sehool teacher and a politician. From
its early days Stanford has been a
leading center of thinking on school
administration and educational guid
ance, and the extensive program of
fered today which is a far cry from
the early department of '"The Art
and History of Education," reflects j
the progress we have made as a
nation in education.
Effect of War
Dr. Kinney told how the war had
curtailed the number of students in
the department and caused a short- ;
age of professors. It is a tribute to j
their skill that so many professors !
have been called into government j
research on educational problems. |
Dean Grayson Kefauver who is on !
leave for work in international edu- !
cation, recently returned from Lon- I
don to report to the U.S. State De- j
partment on educational reconstruc- J
tion plans. A leader also in the field j
of educational guidance, he has writ
ten a book on that topic. According \
to Dr. Kinney, Stanford has made
outstanding contributions in the field
of guidance as well as administra- j
tion.
Reorganization
Under its higher education pro- j
gram Stanford is to organize its field
of college teaching and administra- ;
tion. William Cowley, President of
Hamilton College will replace Alvin
Eurich, Vice-President, in this im
portant field this spring.
The student enrollment in the i
School has changed considerably, j
according to Dr. Kinney. Where for

merly there were a number of men
majoring in the fields of physical
education, science, mathmatics, etc.,
there are now only a lew girls. Dr.
Kinney advises girls who are inter
ested in teaching these courses to
take advantage of the great oppor
tunities, for it will take a long time
after the war to make up the deficit
of teachers. Most unchanged by the
war are the English and Social Stud
ies departments which have 20 stu
dents each. There are 70 enrolled in
