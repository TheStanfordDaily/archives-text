# Dowrie Talks On Economies
## 
### 
Consideration of the Breton Woods
Monetary Conference, called by
President Roosevelt July 1. to dis
cuss the economic plans of world re
construction, highlighted the address
of Dr. George W. Dowrie to the
Tuesday Series audience in Memorial
Hall.
The five nations who will be prom
inent in making deposits in the
World Bank, once its proposal is
accepted by at least 65 per cent of
the 44 countries who were repre
sented at the conference, are the
United States, Great Britain, Russia,
China, and France. j
'Refusal of the United States *
support the World Bank, the "FHA"
in the international lending field,
after our sponsorship of its plan,
would mean the failure of the bank."
said Dr. Dowrie.
The International Monetary Fund,
as well as the World Bank, will be
under the watchful eyes of 12 active
managing directors and a board of
44 governors, one from each rep
resented nation. Serving as a police
man of the "currency conduct" of all
countries, the Fund will be a jack
pot from which the individual nation
will xeceive a loan quota when neces
sary.
Concluding with his persona'
view, Dr. Dowrie, professor of fi
nance in the Graduate School of
Business, stated, "Let us make these
plans for post-war economy sound
and workable by Congressional'.
Amendments and then join our fel
low nations in this venture into in
ternational co-operation."
