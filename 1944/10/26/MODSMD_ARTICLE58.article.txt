# Adjustment Problems Subject of 'Y' Lecture
## 
### 
Opening the Y.W.C.A.'s War So
cial Adjustment Group's autumn
quarter program, Mrs. Harry Rath
bun will speak tomorrow afternoon
at 1 o'clock in the Women's Club
house on the problems of adjust
ment which are daily being expe
rienced not only among men return
ing from the front, but also among
the people who must come in con
tact with them.
This series will consist of four lec
tures, each directed toward this
problem. Second scheduled talk will
be given by Dr. Gretchen Magaret.
A panel discussion, to be held on the
third Friday, will feature students
from Stanford who have themselves
returned from the fronts and from
Army experience.
The fourth lecture will be devoted
entirely to the USO aspect of the
series. All women who attend the
'•omolete series of four will receive
their junior hostess certificates, but
women who already won their cer-

tificates, or who are unable to at
tend them all, are invited to be pres
• ent at whatever lectures they are
, interested in. Women who missed
1 one of the lectures in a previous se
| ries may attend one of these, and
thus receive their card.
| Sign-ups have been going on all
! week in the freshman women's resi
dences; upper division women who
I are interested may sign up either in
I the War Board office, or upstairs in
the "Y" rooms at the Women's Club
house.
