# G.I. Dance Class Starts Tonight
## 
### 
Khaki will blend with bright Quad
colors this evening, as the Army so
cial dancing class meets for the first
time at 9:30 in the Women's Club
house.
No signup is necessary, stresses
Maria Rael, chairman. Every Army
student and coed is welcome, and the
more the merrier.
Plans for this evening begin with a
half hour review of general ballroom
steps, to be followed by 15 minutes
of purely social dancing.
In subsequent weeks, Miss Rael,
assisted by Pinkie Tanner, will go
on to demonstrate the popular but
less familiar Latin American step.-;;
the rhumba, samba, and tango.
