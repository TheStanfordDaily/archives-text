# HOUSES DISCUSS OPENING HOPES
## Fraternity Men Express Approval Of Committee's Post War Plans 
### 
Approval of the Post-war Planning Committee report was made last night
at the first meeting of campus fraternity men in E-2, Education Building,
according to Dick Fay ram, Interfraternity Board Chairman.
It was brought out that the reopening of living groups depended on
a sufficient number of men in the fraternities, and the releasing bv the

University of the houses.
Dick Driscoll, last year's A.S.S.U.
prexy, suggested the advisability of
waiting until a majority of the
houses were prepared to open. This
would permit nil houses to open on
eve nterms.
"Students should not get the idea,"
Fayram said, "that the reopening is
an immediate possibility. It rather
depends on the progress of the war
and return of men to campus, as well
as the financial stability of the indi
vidual fraternity."
It was also suggested that the fra
ternities again this year purchase
space in the Q\u»d. The Interfrater
nity Board fund would be used for
the purchase.
The Post-War Planning report will
now be forwarded to Dr. Tresidder
for approval before its formal publi
cation. Plans are being made now
so that the fraternities will be pre
pared to resume living groups as
soon as the opportunity arises.
