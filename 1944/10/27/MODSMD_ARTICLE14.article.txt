The anonymous letter that I am printing here
is from one of the more backward students on
the campus. The reason that the gal who wrote
this letter did not sign her name is that no one
would know her anyway. This letter, inciden
tally, is the most intelligent of a number sent in
on the subject of 2:30 late leaves for women,
so you can see how we stand in scholastic
averages with other universities and colleges.
(Columnist's note: The comment that will be
contained in the following letter will not neces
sarily be in keeping with the policy of the edi
torial staff.)
Mr. Bullsessioner, Sir: (That's who I am)
In one of your early literary atrocities (I'm cut
to the guick), and I use atrocity advisedly (was
[ that smutty?), you discussed the subject of
2:3o's for women. (That's me she is talking
about.)
It's bad enough that we stay out as late as
1:30. (How can you tell?) Everything closes
up at 12, and it's better for girls to be in bed
than to be up to no good. (The whole sentence
is confusing; please explain.) As a matter of
fact, I have had very few occasions to use
l:3o's (I can believe that), and I know many
others who rarely use them either. (You should
all get together and have a "hard times" party.)
It is terrible for you (that's me) to suggest
that women be allowed to stay out until 2:30
(that's the subject of today's session), since the
only entertainment after 12 is unmentionable.
(You mean unprintable.) When I go out (you
mean you do?), 1 demand to come home right
at 12. (I bet that make's you popular as hell.)
[ see (you can?) no reason why other girls
shouldn't. (Shouldn't what? I got lost.)
In the future (you mean from now on?), let's
talk about something constructive (why? I'm
plus) in Bull Session (that's this column), and
refrain from discussing things (you are against
everything) that will lead to the lowering of
student morals. (A fantastic impossibility, as
they are now way below the bottom.)
In closing (that's good), I wish to say (not
again) that it can't happen here. (Yuk! yuk!)
Respectfully yours (not mine),
An Incensed Senior (you could use it)
