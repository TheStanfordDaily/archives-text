# Cabbages and Things
## 
### Ed Maher 
Not so long ago, I found myself under the
influence of a once important gentleman of
etters named Oliver Wendell Holmes, pere.
only was I pleased and impressed by his
vriting, but I marveled much at his Johnsonian
-ilent for table conversation, most of which
vas recorded in his Breakfast Table series
'hree books full of enlightening monologue de
livered by Dr. Holmes during the morning meals
at a boarding house. I then thought it clever

of him to be able to discourse on so many
subjects and to be able to cover each of them
so thoroughly within a few paragraphs.
A Downright Fake
Now I realize that I didn't know the half of
it, and my appreciation of the sage has altered
accordingly. He was definitely one of two
things: either he was one of the most scintil
lating personalities in American life, or he was
a downright fake. This experience in writing
for a purely morning audience has proved this
to me.
Naturally, I am inclined to think, with my
well-bred, patriotic veneration for historical
figures, that the Autocrat was genuine and
sincere; I will grant that he did hold the atten
tion of the assorted types whom he met each
morning, and that he did raise the minds and
spirits of those who heard him. What beats
me, though, is how the old boy got away
with it.
Sleepy Minds' Attention
Because here I am in the same dewey ship.
(There is no political pun intended here, mainly
because my mind is on Dr. Holmes, and Dr.
Holmes despised puns.) I, who am silent and
uncommunicative to the point of rudeness dur
ing the first hours of the morning, am obliged
to feed you, along with your untasted eggs
and tasteless coffee, reading matter suitable
for digestion by sleepy minds.
It's really a serious problem, you know. Men
and women are never more private individuals
than during their waking hours, and law suits
and divorce cases have arisen over less than
mere annoyance at the matin meal.
We had better change the subject.
The Subject Changed
Protected as it is by the editorial power of
the Daily as well as by the constitutional au
thority of the freedom of the press, the Cabbage
should have little to fear from innocent words
printed here. Nevertheless, its leaves turned
an embarrassed red the other day.
Jim Weinberg, who gets his stuff printed on
the opposite page, and who turns up with sur
prising bits of pertinent information now and
then, tipped me off that R. W. Kenny, the origi
nator of the original Cabbages and Things, is
the state's attorney-general and a big figure in
Democratic party politics hereabouts.
Fugitive Maher
Nov/ I'm quite sure that nothing worthy of
the term libel was included in the last appear
ances of Cabbages, but one really doesn't go
around kicking attorneys-general in the knees,
and to find oneself doing so is cause for discom
fort. During the last couple of days I have no
ticed a strange and pressing weight upon my
back, and sure enough, when I looked around,
there was a horse on me.
