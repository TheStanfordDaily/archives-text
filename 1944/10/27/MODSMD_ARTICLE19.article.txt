# Gerona Squad May Surprise
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
"Fair but not sensational" is what
issued forth in our conversation with
Coach Paul Lee of Gerona A.C.
when we inquired about his six-man
grid team's chances in the league
which opens next Tuesday.
"We'll do all right," Lee continued.
With the array of stars slated to
throw the pigskin around for Ge
rona, maybe they'll do much more
than just "all right."
Kosburg at Quarter
Expected to furnish the spark to
scintillating attack will be quar
')ack Bob Rosburg, who rose to
fame with his superb golfing and
softball performances last summer.
Evidently Rosburg will do a 1 title
passing; at least it sounds logical
alter knowing that he pitched seven
wins against one loss in the softball
murals last quarter.
Taking care of the halfback spots
will be Coach Lee, Frank Casella,
and Rex Alsap. A veteran in mural
circles, Casella possesses the speed
which will make Gerona's running
attack as potent as its aerial game.
Lee, a high-school vet from the na
tion's capital, is as all-around a play
er yet to be offered by any team.
Three Good Ends
Alternating at the end positions
will'be Parker Reiche, Bob Forbes,
and Dave Gray, all graced with
"sticky-finger-itis." Reiche got his
football experience at Sutter High
School in Sacramento.
Filling out a well-balanced team
i.s Johnny Hanlon, who centered the
ball on a championship Sacramento
High squad a season or so back,
Hanlon will be as defensive
obstacle as an offensive threat from
his pivot post.
