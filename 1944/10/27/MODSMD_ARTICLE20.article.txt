## SIDELINE SLANTS 
### BY BILL ADAMS 
We didn't want to do it. Honest
we didn't. After our tragic showing
of last week, we really didnit want
to dump any more of our foul tips
on our disillusioned readers. But
the editor says if we're gonna have a
sports page we gotta put sports on
it, so here we go again, picking the
top football games of the week.
As you should know, the far
famed staff of grandstand coaches
consists of Jim Weinberg, Barney
Gugel, Mort Cohen, Gordon Levy,
and Bill Adams. After taking such
a beating on their first attempt the
experts have come to the conclusion
that there's safety in numbers; all
except Weinberg. It was Jimmy's
first experience with wartime opium,
j and the effects were disastrous, as
I he insisted on disagreeing with ev
j eryone on everything. Here the
(peerless predictions—take 'em or
| leave 'em.
j' Army over Duke by three or four
I touchdowns. Nobody could deny the
mighty cadets this one.
Navy over Penn by 7. Adams and
I Weinberg couldn't see it that way.
Notre Dame to clean up on 111 i—
I nois. Everyone conceded the Irish
about four touchdowns.
Indiana to beat lowa by about 10
points, all agreeing.
Purdue to squeeze by Michigan by
(i. Levy was asleep when this one
was made, and Jimmy wanted some
one to help him support (he Wol
verines, so we put down Levy's
name too.
Ohio State over Minnesota by 20.

The Buckeyes are hot and rated ev
erybody's choice.
Georgia Tech over Georgia Pre-
Flight by 7. Weinberg was raving
by this time and insisted on the Navy
Flyers.
Georgia over L.S.U. by one touch
down. Not much to go on, as both
teams have seen better days. Wein
berg went off the deep end again on
this one.
Oklahoma over T.C.U. by 2. Three
times in a row are too much, and
we were forced to call the booby
hatch when Jimmy once more dis
sented.
Tulsa over Texas A.& M. by two
touchdowns, with harmony prevail
ing once more.
Texas over Rice by 7. Unani
mously acclaimed.
Cal over Washington by 14. The
Huskies looked poor last week, but
they w.ere suffering under a mental
handicap, and they will probably
play much better ball now.
U.S.C. to massacre St. Mary's. Tell
us how it came out; we can't look.
It's too dreadful.
Fourth Air Force to edge by a re
juvenated St. Mary's Pre-Flight with
one touchdown to spare. A good
game for anybody's dough.
Alameda Coast Guard over U.C.-
L.A. by 14. By this time the little
men in the white coats had come for
Weinberg, but we got a post card
from Napa yesterday saying he was
for the Bruins "for sentimental rea
sons." What more proof of his in
sanity is needed?
