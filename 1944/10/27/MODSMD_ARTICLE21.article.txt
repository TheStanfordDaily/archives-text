A half - hour meeting between
Coach Elwyn Bugge, director of
Stanford intramural sports, and the
managers of the fall quarter mural
football teams yesterday afternoon
resulted in the arrangement of the
schedules and rules for the coming
season.
As sixteen teams signed up for
the sport, it was decided to divide
the squads into two leagues of eight
teams apiece. Games are to be
played on Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons at 4:30 on the four foot
ball practice fields. No games will be
played in the Sunken Diamond or
the stadium.
Sixty-yard Fields
Games will be played on fields ap
proximately 00 yards long and 40
yards wide, with first downs awarded
only at mid-field; that is, each team
will gain a first down upon crossing
the mid-stripe. From (here it will
be necessary to score in four downs
or lose the ball. Each game will last
40 minutes—the clock will not be
stopped for any kind of play. Halves
are to last 20 minutes with a live
minute intermission between.
Standard football rules will apply
with the necessary exceptions. All
members of a team are eligible for a
pass. Pass may be thrown from any

where behind the line of .scrimmage.
Penalties for offside, backfield in mo
tion, etc., will be live yards, while
those for fouling, clipping, etc., will
be ten yards.
Conversions Used
A regulation place kick is vised for
the kicknff, which is done from the
20-yard line. For the first time in
several years, conversions will be
used, and must be made from the
five-yard line by running or pass
ing plays, as there are no goal posts
There will, therefore, be no field
goals.
Kicks over the goal will bo put
in play on the 20, as in the regulation
game. End zones are ten yards long.
Teams Provide Kefs
Each of the teams compeling in any
game must provide a referee for the
game, who will be charged with

etc. Managers are urged to make
sure that the referees are well ac
quainted with all of the rules.
