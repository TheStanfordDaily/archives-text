More on the battle of the Sibuyan
Sea:
As was stated yesterday, the Japa
nese effort was to take advantage of
the splitting of our forces, one naval
fleet engaging them around Formosa
while the other supported General
Mac-Arthur around Leyte. Accord
ingly, they threw their whole fleet
in except for aircraft carriers, one
column striking out from Formosa
to keep Admiral Halsey pinned down,
one moving south from the enemy
concentration there to invade the
Sibuyan Sea, the waters between
Luzon and Mindanao that are
sprinkled with the multitude of is
lands in the central Philippines, and
another, probably brought up from
Singapore, striking into the Sibuyan
Sea from the south, or the area north
of Mindanao.
As was also mentioned, they made
two mistakes. The most important
was the while concept, since they
could not git enough away from Ad
miral Halsey to make their fleet
large enough for a smashing victory,
and the second being attacking in
those narrow waters, where the at
tacking force is at a disadvantage
because it does not have space
enough to deploy its striking force,
and the smaller force is at an ad
vantage.
Other Mistakes
A third blunder seems to have
been to hold their aircraft carriers
back. Their main reserve of these
ships was not employed, probably
because they were afraid to. This is
against all axioms of naval tactics.
A fleet can never be risked piece
meal because its full success lies in
co-ordinated use of everything. Be
cause of the lack of aircraft carriers
in large numbers, the Japanese at
tack was hampered, and now they do
not have enough other ships to make
an adequate escort for these ships.
Their main idea seems to have
been to catch the Seventh Fleet,
which supports General Mac Arthur,

bottled up in the Leyte Gulf. What
they should have done was to es
tablish a naval picket line in the
central Philippines, based on small
forces operating in the narrow chan
nels and supported by land based
airpower on the various islands,
which would be similar to strong
points in land warfare. If they did
not have adequate airpower, then
they should have attempted nothing
here, because aircraft can wreck
havoc on fleets moving in crowded
areas. They should have, if they
didn t have the planes, do what
they must do now; namely, trust the
defense of Japan to their aircraft
there and try to cover the China
coast.
As for China, it can be remarked
that the enemy is in a bad spot
around Kweilin. They tried to out
flank it by seizing Kweiping, a town
to the west of it. But in order to
turn an enemy's flank, you must ex
pose your own. and a swift Chinese
move had taken advantage of this to
encircle the enemy in Kweiping.

vantage.
Other Mistakes
A third blunder seems to have
been to hold their aircraft carriers
back. Their main reserve of these
ships was not employed, probably
because they were afraid to. This is
against all axioms of naval tactics.
A fleet can never be risked piece
meal because its full success lies in
co-ordinated use of everything. Be
cause of the lack of aircraft carriers
in large numbers, the Japanese at
tack was hampered, and now they do
not have enough other ships to make
an adequate escort for these ships.
Their main idea seems to have
been to catch the Seventh Fleet,
which supports General Mac Arthur,

bottled up in the Leyte Gulf. What
they should have done was to es
tablish a naval picket line in the
central Philippines, based on small
forces operating in the narrow chan
nels and supported by land based
airpower on the various islands,
which would be similar to strong
points in land warfare. If they did
not have adequate airpower, then
they should have attempted nothing
here, because aircraft can wreck
havoc on fleets moving in crowded
areas. They should have, if they
didn t have the planes, do what
they must do now; namely, trust the
defense of Japan to their aircraft
there and try to cover the China
coast.
As for China, it can be remarked
that the enemy is in a bad spot
around Kweilin. They tried to out
flank it by seizing Kweiping, a town
to the west of it. But in order to
turn an enemy's flank, you must ex
pose your own. and a swift Chinese
move had taken advantage of this to
encircle the enemy in Kweiping.
More on the battle of the Sibuyan
Sea:
As was stated yesterday, the Japa
nese effort was to take advantage of
the splitting of our forces, one naval
fleet engaging them around Formosa
while the other supported General
Mac-Arthur around Leyte. Accord
ingly, they threw their whole fleet
in except for aircraft carriers, one
column striking out from Formosa
to keep Admiral Halsey pinned down,
one moving south from the enemy
concentration there to invade the
Sibuyan Sea, the waters between
Luzon and Mindanao that are
sprinkled with the multitude of is
lands in the central Philippines, and
another, probably brought up from
Singapore, striking into the Sibuyan
Sea from the south, or the area north
of Mindanao.
As was also mentioned, they made
two mistakes. The most important
was the while concept, since they
could not git enough away from Ad
miral Halsey to make their fleet
large enough for a smashing victory,
and the second being attacking in
those narrow waters, where the at
tacking force is at a disadvantage
because it does not have space
enough to deploy its striking force,
and the smaller force is at an ad
vantage.
