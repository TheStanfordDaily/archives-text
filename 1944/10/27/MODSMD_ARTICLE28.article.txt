# Capable Cast Fails To Help Curran Play
## 
### 
"Three Is a Family,'' current .ve
hicle at the Curran, proves conclu
sively that Phoebe and Henry Ephron
are firmly in possession of the facts
of life, an issue never greatly in
doubt. The only other safe conclu
sion is that the facts of life can be
boring and monotonous—especially
when presented by Phoebe and
Henry Ephron.
Based on the formula that lots of
eccentric adults, babies, mothers,
and expectant mothers crowded into
a small enough apartment should be
funny, "Three" goes on to demon
strate that exactly the opposite can
also be true.
Although technically adequate—it
is light and fast moving—the dia
ogue and the situations just fail to
be genuinely funny. The end result
was tedious and irritating. Only a
top-heavy sense of justice kept this
reviewer from leaving before the
first act was over.
The cast was competent, which is
really a serious criticism as farce
comedy requires a spark of some
thing above mere competence. With
:he single exception of Una Merkle,
who would still be better off to pick
up her southern accent wherever she
left it and return to lusher 'Holly
wood roles, the whole cdmpany
seemed even more bored with the
production than of the audience.
The play, if acted to the hilt, would
have died on its feet. But instead
it was carried on in the first act al
ready a gasping invalid, throttled to
death in the second by the Indiffer
ent cast who then proceeded to make
merry over the corpse in the third.
