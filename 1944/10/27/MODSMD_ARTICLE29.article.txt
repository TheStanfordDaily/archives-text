# Dean Discusses Humanities
## 
### ELAINE WOOD 
Stanford's School of Humanities
has been underway since 1942. with
John Wendell Dodds, professor of
English, as its dean.
Professor Dodds took his under
graduate training at Wooster College
in Ohio. From here Professor Dodds
went to Yale where he took M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees. He then taught at
the Univex'sity of Pittsburgh for
awhile, but he didn't enjoy its at
mosphere nearly as much as ours.
Dr. Dodds has been at Stanford
since 1937 as professor of English,
with his specialty the Victorian pe
riod. His course in the study of
Keats, Shelley, and Byron is one of
his best. Each year Professor Dodds
gave his full attention and time to
the Army program, and he said that
it. was good to return to the "civilian
life."
Wrote Book In England
The year before he came to Stan
ford, Dodds spent in England writ
ing a book on Thackery entitled
"Thackei-y—a Critical Portrait,"and
another in 1942 on "Thomas Souterne
Dramatist."
Professor John Wendell Dodds was
appointed Dean of the School of Hu
manities in 1942. the same year that
the school was organized—with the

help of the Rockefeller Foundation
Funds. There are ten departments
in this school, so the student has a
large selection of majors. Professor
Dodds said that the school program
has been underway now for three

years, and"it is continually becom
ing more clean cut."
Careful Plans Laid
During the first year, the school
laid careful plans for the future. The
Executive Committee decided to con
centrate on a good undergraduate
program and set up a graduate cur
riculum at a later date.
"The purpose of the school pro-
I gram is to give the student a major
in a field rather than in particular
i discipline," said Professor Dodds.
| The student, therefore, prepares for
' a general liberal education instead of
i concentrating on one .specific sub
ject.
Series of Majors
i Junior and senior concentration is
ion Medieval Civilization, Renais
; sance Civilization, American Civili
! za'tion, and the Arts. Also there are
a series of regional majors which deal
with the Far East, Latin America,
; Germany, France, Central Europe,
I Russia, Greece, and the western
| Mediterranean.
Courses in geography and anthro
pology are new additions to the
school. For a number of years there
has been much interest in these two
I subjects, so now the School of Hu
| inanities is able to include them in
the curriculum.
