Tickets for the C;il-U.S.C. football
jame to be played Saturday after
noon, Nov. 18, will go on sale in the
rVS.S.U. office Monday afternoon
from 1 to 4:30, if they arrive this

, week-end, Jim Emerson, ticket sales
chairman, announced yesterday.
If the tickets fail to come in time
for Monday selling, they will go on
sale the afternoon following their ar
rival. Sales will continue throughout
the week from 1 to 4:30 p.m., and on
Saturday morning from 9 to 12. First

I A section of the Berkeley stadium
' has been reserved for attending In
! diar.s and individual seats are not
being reserved, Emerson said. Ad
mission for students is half-price,
plus full-price taxes, totaling $1.40.
Only one ticket will be sold to a
student upon presentation of a stu
dent body card. This rule will be
excepted when a man is taking a
! woman to the game; then he may
buy both tickets. However, no
groups of tickets will be sold, that
is, a student cannot buy a section
of tickets for his or her living group.
Those taking cars to the game are
asked to leave their names at the
A.S.S.U. office when they buy their
tickets, in case some Stanfordite es
sential to the program should be un-
I able to find other transportation.
If transportation can be worked
j out, the Stanford band will play at
the game and perform stunts dur
ing the half. An intricate rooting
program is under organization, in
cluding card stunts, yells and songs.
