At Encina Hall a consistent craze
<.meaning that it is consistently driv
ing us crazy) is tonette music (?).
Tone—meaning a musical sound, and
ette—noun suffix meaning diminu
tive; hence, a diminutive musical
sound. Well, the gist of the matter
is that when you get a couple play
ing Tonettes together (that's a com
pliment) the sound is not so diminu
tive and not so musical.
Notable players around Encina are
Bob Huyhes, army editor; Bob An
geloch, who is organizing an all
girl tonette band; and Norman (the
walking brain) Crowder. Hollywood
has made offers and we have made
threats, but to no avail; they will not
leave Encina.
Orchids to Hcrr
I woul 1 rather pass out raspberries
than orchids, but orchids are the or
der of the day for Jackie Herr and
his "Dabblers in Swing." The band
is not only good but its members
spend their free time giving us free
entertainment and enjoyment. There
should bo other tokens of apprecia
tion beside the verbal ones. Big
things are in the offing for tonight
starting with a party at the Nitery.
Let's all be there.
Among my notes I discover that
Jerrv Goodhue has been elected
president of the Newman Club.
Social Chairmen Announced
Mike Donahue is social chairman
for the unit with Ted Farrell assist
ing him. Pinky Tanner is social
chairman for Company C; Jack Ket
cham is social chairman for Com
pany A, with his shadow, Jack
Chester, as assistant. Girls, paste
these names in your minds. Oh, go
ahead—it doesn't hurt a bit!
Thirty men from Company C at
tended the Grace Moore concert at
San Jose last Thursday night. The
boys gave out with impromptu mu
sic in the back of the truck both on
the way to and from the concert.
Selections ranged from songs from
"Porgy and Bess" to what we shall
call popular unwritten ballads. Grace
Moore sang too.
Sebastian Bruno, the mythical man
of Company C is with us again this
semester offering to swap trousers,
attending the Grace Moore concert,
and in general leading the life of
Riley. What kind of life did Riley
lead?
Lag Dinner Makes Hit
The exchange dinner with Lagu
nita Wednesday night was a tre
mendous success (from where I saw
it). Yes, delicious food and a beau
tiful girl (yes, she was). What more
could a man want —cton't tell me!
After dinner I shuffled the cards
while the more intellectual members
of the party played bridge.
If you are a square from Dela
ware or an "I don't dance" boy
from old Illinois, or if you just want
to meet a new girl, your cue is to
attend the Thursday night dancing
lessons and dance in the Women's
Clubhouse between 9:30 and our
bedtime. Maria Rael will be there
to instruct; girls will be there to
serve as partners; the combination
is unbeatable.

the way to and from the concert.
Selections ranged from songs from
"Porgy and Bess" to what we shall
call popular unwritten ballads. Grace
Moore sang too.
Sebastian Bruno, the mythical man
of Company C is with us again this
semester offering to swap trousers,
attending the Grace Moore concert,
and in general leading the life of
Riley. What kind of life did Riley
lead?
Lag Dinner Makes Hit
The exchange dinner with Lagu
nita Wednesday night was a tre
mendous success (from where I saw
it). Yes, delicious food and a beau
tiful girl (yes, she was). What more
could a man want —cton't tell me!
After dinner I shuffled the cards
while the more intellectual members
of the party played bridge.
If you are a square from Dela
ware or an "I don't dance" boy
from old Illinois, or if you just want
to meet a new girl, your cue is to
attend the Thursday night dancing
lessons and dance in the Women's
Clubhouse between 9:30 and our
bedtime. Maria Rael will be there
to instruct; girls will be there to
serve as partners; the combination
is unbeatable.
At Encina Hall a consistent craze
<.meaning that it is consistently driv
ing us crazy) is tonette music (?).
Tone—meaning a musical sound, and
ette—noun suffix meaning diminu
tive; hence, a diminutive musical
sound. Well, the gist of the matter
is that when you get a couple play
ing Tonettes together (that's a com
pliment) the sound is not so diminu
tive and not so musical.
Notable players around Encina are
Bob Huyhes, army editor; Bob An
geloch, who is organizing an all
girl tonette band; and Norman (the
walking brain) Crowder. Hollywood
has made offers and we have made
threats, but to no avail; they will not
leave Encina.
Orchids to Hcrr
I woul 1 rather pass out raspberries
than orchids, but orchids are the or
der of the day for Jackie Herr and
his "Dabblers in Swing." The band
is not only good but its members
spend their free time giving us free
entertainment and enjoyment. There
should bo other tokens of apprecia
tion beside the verbal ones. Big
things are in the offing for tonight
starting with a party at the Nitery.
Let's all be there.
Among my notes I discover that
Jerrv Goodhue has been elected
president of the Newman Club.
Social Chairmen Announced
Mike Donahue is social chairman
for the unit with Ted Farrell assist
ing him. Pinky Tanner is social
chairman for Company C; Jack Ket
cham is social chairman for Com
pany A, with his shadow, Jack
Chester, as assistant. Girls, paste
these names in your minds. Oh, go
ahead—it doesn't hurt a bit!
Thirty men from Company C at
tended the Grace Moore concert at
San Jose last Thursday night. The
boys gave out with impromptu mu
sic in the back of the truck both on
the way to and from the concert.
