### BOB HUGHES 
Having 1 war-time servant problems? Maid unfaithful to you? Cook
smoking your favorite pipe? Butler in the army and washwoman welding
at Lockheed?
For (he sake of reminiscence, here's your chance to view again a house
hold equipped with five servants, all beautifully trained, exceptionally
discreet, and incredibly efficient. ♦ •

Headed by the redoubtable Domi
nic, played by Joaquin Aguirre, this
staff will be found in the rather
strange home of one Mr. Latimer,
where they provide much humour in
A. A. Milne's sparkling comedy, "The
Dover Road," which comes to the
Little Theater Wednesday, Nov. 8,
for a five day run.
Latimer Peculiar
Mr. Latimer, known on campus as
Johnny High, is a rather curious old
man of wealth who delights in way
laying unsuspecting couples taking
the "Dover Road" to France for a
runaway marriage. Enticing them
into his home, he there presents
them to each other in the most un
romantic forms imaginable, testing
whether their love is real, or whether
it is an infatuation which will lead
to an unfortunate marriage.
By this form of probation he hopes
to prevent too hasty marriages. It is
his conception of humanitarianism,
and he enjoys it tremendously.
Among Mr. Latimer's more harm
less idiosyncracies is the costuming
of his staff, wherein he indulges in
wierd fancy and expresses his per
sonality as he sees fit.
Servants Bring Nostalgia
The sight of these five servants
will probably call lip bittersweet
tears of nostalgia to those who have
rough red hands as a result of wash
ing their own dishes lor the past few
years. If anything is wanted by any
member of the household, a very
understanding member of the staff
has already anticipated the command
and floated in with it. This, of course,
leads to some rather ludicrous situa
tions.
The haughty and implacable but
let, Dominic, is played by Mr.
Aguirre, who was born in Bolivia,
took his major in Dramatics at Dart
mouth, and is here working for his
M.A.
Other members of the servant clan
in this slightly eccentric home in
clude Cari Strahm, born in Switzer
land, and a freshman, Mary Cogs
well, a transfer student from Pasa
dena Junior College, Charles Letts,
whose home is in Michigan, and Jan
ice Swan, a junior from Washington
