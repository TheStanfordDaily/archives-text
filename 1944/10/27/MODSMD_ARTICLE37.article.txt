# Mills Listens To Stravinsky
## 
### 
Igor Stravinsky, the most influen
tial of contemporary composers,
spoke on "Composing, Performing,
Listening," last Wednesday night at
Mills College. He defined a com
poser as a man sensitive to the voices
of nature and possessing a broad cul
tural background as a basis for taste
and with the necessary technical
abilities.
"A performer," he said, "must i
only transmit and display the ideas I
of the composer, not interpret the |
work to suit himself. The final
criteria of a composition or perform
ance is the degree of spiritual par
ticipation on the part of the audience.
Conscious listening not passive at
tention constitutes a real listener.
At the conclusion of his talk, he
and Nadia Boulanger played a new
sonata for two pianos. The most
conspicuous diviations from the tra
ditional sonata form were in the first
and third movements. The first, a
bright allegro, was in cyclic form
with recurring themes. The second
movement, andante, contained a slow
pastoral theme worked up to a fast
climax and then returning to the
original key and tempo.
The third movement was structur- j
ally the most complicated. Starting j
with a four voiced fugue it went into i
several keys and variations with i
sharp rhythmic changes. The per- j
formance concluded with Scherzo a I
la Husse and a descriptive Circus j
Polka.
By definition, a composer can not
be criticized when playing his own ;
works—anything he does is right. !
