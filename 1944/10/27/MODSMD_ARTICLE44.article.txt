In the renewal of an ancient grid rivalry (one week old to
day) the Dee Gee and the Kappa hashers will meet in battle at
A p.m. today in the sunken diamond.
Sparked by Ric "the Goose" Supple and Fred "Not Under
weight" Maguire, the Dee Gee sguad hopes to hold John "Boy
Is He Fast" Fulton, Ed "Practically Transparent" Luce and Don
"Smooth Slinger of Touchdown Passes" Landale in check.
Plans from the rival camps include card stunts, yells, screams,
and a varied miscellany of actviities intended to entertain at
half time.
An invitation has been extended to the general public and
it is expected that a tremendous crowd will attend. Ushers will
be in charge of all parking and seating facilities.
Officials for the game will be referee P. G. Lee, Gerona A.C.,
and the Mole, Monroe Bridge and Coke Club.
Games, entertainment, and fun will be the keynote of the
Cardinal Hallowe'en party in the Nitery tonight. It is an all
campus party and it is hoped that the Stanford rough will grab
his best gal and attend. A fine dance is planned for after the
party, with music by a well-known (guess whose) band. Activi
ties start at 7:30 and will continue on into the night (longer if
we had 2:3o's).
