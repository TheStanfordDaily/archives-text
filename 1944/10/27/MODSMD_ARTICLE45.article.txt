Paramount's "Double Indemnity." starring Fred Mat-Murray and Bar
bara Stanwyck, is a strong murder yarn that's packed with an ever
mounting degree of suspense.

cal study are indeed notable achieve
ments lor Hollywood? The dialogue
is crisp and acting performances well

trayal of a worldly woman is at
times almost fascinating.
As a sidelight, Miss Stanwyck's
husband is pictured as a former
Stanford man and is en route to
Palo Alto when his untimely demise
occurs.
For some unexplainable reason,
Stanford is also mentioned in the
second feature, "Maisie Goes to
Reno." While en route to Reno, Mai
sie (Ann Sothern) meets a soldier,
also Reno bound, who relates that
he met a beautiful Stanford fresh
man in 1940 (at this time the au

for a very understandable reason),
but now wants a divorce from her.
Anyway, gold-digging Maisie pulls
the old "badger" acme in Reno and
unites once again the beautiful Stan
lord woman and the ever-so dumb
soldier. All of this is very uninter
esting to the casual observer.'—Dick
