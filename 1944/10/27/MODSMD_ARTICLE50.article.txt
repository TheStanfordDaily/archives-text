# Health Service, Gym Class Policies Stated by Directors

i Among the many functions of the Stanford Women's
, Health Service, one of the important ones is the physi
| cal examination given to all students when they first
I enter Stanford, according to Dr. Lois Pendleton Todd.
Acting Medical Adviser of Women.
If any defects are found after a thorough physical
J examination, further tests are made. Students are then

i referred to their private physicians"
| if possible, with whom .Jhe Health
j Service co-operates.
j Catches Illness
It diagnoses illnesses when pos
[ sible and sends serious cases to the
j hospital where they are cared for by
a private physician of their own
I choice. For which the Student Guild
Fund pays.
The Service also sends students to
, the Rest Home, which is supported
! by the Mothers' Club, when it seems
! advisable. But no serious cases go i
| there.
Treats Colds
The Health Service does all il can
for both individual and community j
health. It encourages reporting all j
colds, which can often be checked if
treated early.
The Health Service has been grad
ually developing. At first it was con- j
cerned mainly with the direction of
physical education. Under Dr. Helen
B. Pryor's leadership for the past ten j
years, the medical department grad
ually evolved. Following Dr. Pryor's 1
i resignation this summer, Dr. Todd j
became Acting Medical Advisor. At
; present Dr. Todd, who has been with
1 the Health Service six years, is the ,
! only full-time doctor. She is as
; sisted part-time by Dr. Magdalene |
Corr, Dr. Rachel Rafferty, and Dr.
Ruth Smith.
I)r. Todd's Work in China
Before coming to Stanford, Dr.
j Todd spent 18 years in China. There
she did almost every type of medical
and surgical work. She was in charge
of all women and children patients
j for seven years in a 75 bed hospital
in Tehchow in Shantung Province.
I She then spent 11 years in Peking '
where she organized and carried on
the Health Service for ihe Peking-
American school, a primary and high
school.
The first two weeks of this quarter !
the Health Service saw 1,246 girls, !
only 463 of which were new students !
having a physical examination.
' One thing in particular I hope the
Stanford Health Service can have
some day is an infirmary where the
students may be hospitalized under
the care of the University Physi
cians," Dr. Todd said. "This plan has
worked admirably in the University
of California, University of Minne
sota, University of Michigan, and
many other universities of high
standing. In these universities the
community fund pays the running ,
Expenses."

'"Maximum benefits from physical education classes
for women can only be obtained by regular attendance
at class," according to Maud L. Knapp, Director of
Physical Edupcation for women, in a statement released
to clarify the policy of the department with regard to
attendance.
Because of this attempt to make physical education

♦ really worthwhile for the students,
j there can be no unexcused absences
Jor cuts permitted. Excuses because
l of illness may be obtained from the
j teacher of the course, prior to the
! class from which the student expects
to be absent, and from the health
i service only if treatment is given
j there.
Beforethe war, all illness excuses
j came directly from the health serv
| ice to the instructor, but this policy
j had to be altered this year because
the health service stafl now has only
j one doctor working full-time, and
| three part-time doctors.
The student may also obtain an
i excuse for something other than ill -
I ness if it is very important, and if
| she sees her instructor before the
| class. The instructors are always in
their offices from the hour till ten
ten minutes after the hour.
If a girl misses more than twenty
per cent of her classes, even because
j of illness, she may either make up
j the classes or take a straight C in it.
| It is entirely up to her to decide
[ which she wants to do. One unex
| cused absence, however, is cause for
! a flunk in the course. This may be
! made up in the last quarter of her
j senior year when normally no gym ,
courseis required. If a girl in Lower
Division flunks gym, she will be con
sidered a Lower Division student for
one extra quarter.
j A girl who has flunked a gym
j course already and has just one more
unexcused absence may have her
j registration at the University can
j celled unless she can present a good
l excuse, and a third flunk will auto- j
matically cancel registration.
A girl on rest schedule automati
cally is exempt from physical edu- I
cation. This schedule requires that j
the girl turn in a card each week j
stating that she has rested eight
hours a day. She may not take any j
one-thirty late leaves unless she has
petitioned the health service for a
late leave and the petition has been
granted.
Last year a questionnaire was cir- |
culated among all the girls in the j
gym classes asking their opinions of i
the physical education program. The
results of this questionnaire showed
that 86% of the girls approved of
the gym requirement, although some j
of the parts of the department's pol
icy might not have appealed to them, I
and 92 € 'c of the girls liked gym.
