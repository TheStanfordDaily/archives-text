# 33 Ships Sunk In Jap Debacle
## 
### 
U.S. PACIFIC FLEET H.Q., PEARL HARBOR, Oct. 26 (UP).—
Ten Japanese battleships, three aircraft carriers and upward of
20 cruisers and destroyers have been sunk or damaged in the
momentous United States naval victory in the Philippines, the
battle area is strewn with burning or crippled enemy warships
and remnants of the broken, beaten Imperial fleet are fleeing
wildly for safety, still under merciless attack.
One battleship has been sunk, a second has been almost
certainly sunk, two more probably have been sunk, and six have
been damaged. Two aircraft carriers have been sunk and one
probably has been sunk. Four cruisers at least have been sunk
and about nine damaged. Several destroyers have been sunk
and about seven damaged. This gives a grand total of 33 or
more enemy ships sunk or damaged —and full reports are still
to come.

It was indicated that the total of
enemy ships sunk or damaged may
reach more than 50. Latest reports
estimated that 39 to 40 ships were
in the two Japanese fleets defeated
in the mid-Philippines. It is pos
sible that not one will escape. At
least 12 enemy ships were sunk or
damaged in the third battle, north of
the Philippines.
The Imperial Japanese fleet has
been crippled with 10 of its known
12 battleships out of action.
