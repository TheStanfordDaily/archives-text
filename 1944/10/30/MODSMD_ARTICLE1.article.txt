# 'Dover Road' Comedy Hit, Starts Nov. 8
## 
### BOB HUGHES 
It is not advisable to take to the
Dover Road late at night if you are
contemplating running away to
marry. Strange things happen to
those who do. For sometimes they
encounter a minor accident on the
way to France which compels them
to seek shelter, and usually by some
mysterious quirk of fate the '"sort of
a hotel" they wander up to is the
home of wealthy Mr. Latimer.
And Mr. Latimer's greatest pleas
ure in life is in submitting question
ably mated couples to a week or so
of curious probation before sending
them on their way, sometimes to
wedding bells, but often in different
directions.
Season Opener
A. A. Milne has written a spark
ling bit of high comedy around this
situation, and his play, "The Dover
Road" has been chosen by F. C.
Strickland to open the Stanford
Player's season for a five night run
starting Nov. 8.
Austere, dominating, and eccentric
Mr. Latimer is played by Johnny
High, a senior who attended Stan
ford from 193!) to 1943, and then was
called to the army. Recently dis
charged from Camp Claiborne in
Louisiana, he has returned to finish
his senior year. Among his best roles
here have been the Archbishop in
"St. Joan," Peecham in "Beggar's
Opera," Roosevelt in Knicker
bocker Holiday," and Count Man
cini in "He Who Gets Slapped."
While in the army he also appeared
in many shows.
Unconsidered Elopement
Hazel Spore, as Ann, becomes a
woman eloping with a man without
due consideration. Now a senior
here, she transferred from Colorado
College last spring quarter because
of Stanford's dramatic department,
and had a small part in "The Truth
About Blayds."
Sally Stocker, another senior ma
joring in drama, comes from San
Bernardino. She was featured in
"Squaring the Circle," and"The
Truth About Blayds." In the eternal
pentagon formed by the characters
in "The Dover Road," she is ideally
cast as Eustacia, a lovely and sac
charine wife both found by her hus
band and finding her husband in a
very embarrassing situation.


SALLY STOCKER
". . . . your Eustacia."
