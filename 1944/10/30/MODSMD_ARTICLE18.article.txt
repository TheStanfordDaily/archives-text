# BULL SESSION
## 
### Dick Crane 
Now that the presidential election is practically upon us, I feel
that it is the duty of the old Bull Sessioner to make some sort of
comment on this greatest election of our nation.
As I try to write about happenings that only pertain to campus
life, I am going to give out with a little conversation that might
be overheard in any of the girls' dorms these days. This will be
a purely political talk, and I shall pick for an example, the
Parnie Storey House, in which reside the Delta Gammas, or
commonly known as Dee Gees.
The 'ensuing dialogue will have only two "characters," and
one we shall call for clarity, a D.G. Republican, and the other
for the lack of anything else, aG— D Democrat. (Columnist's
note: I wish to make clear that there is nothing personal in this,
but merely for the sake of my readers.)
TITLE; "Vote For the Former Asst. Sec. of the Navy," or "I Know
the Cutest Ensign That Ever Rolled On Two Feet."
G— D— Dem.—"l'm going to vote for F.D.R., because he is a
former Harvard man, and I had a date with a Harvard man one
night, and they are s-o-o-o nic-e-e-e!"
D.G. Rep.—"Well I am certainly not going to vote for Roose
velt, because his regime is taking all of my father's money, and
where we used to go to New York every Christmas, I now have
to spend the holiday season sitting around that "crummy" Mo
cambos, or going to that boring Cocoanut Grove."
D — G-— Dem.—"l agree with you about the money, things
are tough all over, but look; Frank Sinatra is for Roosevelt, and
no one in their right mind could possibly do anything against
Frankie-e-e!" (voice rises to a shrill scream.)
D.G. Rep.—"Let's not bring passion into this, as it's supposed
to be a intellectual conversation. My father is a Republican, his
father before him, and his father before him, and besides Hoover
slept here. Where is your Stanford spirit?"
G— D— Dem.—"But let's be rational about this thing. You
like sailors, right? Well I like sailors, right? Right! Franklin
likes sailors too, so we all like sailors, and we all have some
thing in common. Right? Right. I say let's vote for the sailors'
friend.
The D.G. Republican says nothing, but stealthily draws her
knife, and with all the brute force that only a Dee Gee possesses,
guickly ends the argument in complete unconditional victory.
With this, ends the dialogue, and today's session. To quote an
old saying; "Right is might, and justice triumphs." Viva la Re
publicans.
