The two main theaters of action in the Pacific war are pro
ducing major events. We are moving towards Luzon in the
Philippines, and the Japanese, after suddenly driving in Chi
nese outpost lines, had reached the outskirts of Kweilin.
Now that the Japanese fleet is no longer a factor in the Phil
ippines campaign, General Mac Arthur is capable of rapid ad
vances. He now has no worries about his overseas supply lines.
He seems to have completely established himself on Leyte, and
is now invading Cebu, just to the north of it. After Cebu, the
next island is Luzon itself.
LUZON INVASION
Admiral Halsey might join in the invasion of Luzon, landing
torces on the north end of that island as soon as General Mac-
Arthur gains a foothold on the southern beaches. This would
duplicate the maneuver that the Japanese used in their invasion,
vhich was very effective in levering us out of Manila and into
he narrow bottleneck of Bataan. Considering the qualitative
superiority of our armor and artillery to theirs it is very prob
able that we will not have as difficult a task as they did in
leaiincr it cut.
