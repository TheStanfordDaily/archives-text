# Wastebaskets Save Room 154
## 
### LaVERNE BRAVO 
Never a dull moment is had at
Casa Naranja in Lagunita. There
wasn't enough folly yesterday, so
the gals hit the news and caused
considerable excitement with a roar
ing fire. It all started at 1:45 in
room 154, "home, sweet home" for
Shirley Parker.
In tune with the times. Shirley
had her Haloween pumpkin burning
in the front window of her room. But
something went wrong, and the
round, grinning little thing toppled
over.
Its party-time flame touched the
curtains on the window, and within
a matter of seconds curtains and
krapes were one mad fire.
Corridor gals of Shirley's dumped
their waste-baskets in their rooms,
filled them with water, and formed
a bucket brigade to the rescue of
room 154.
A few minutes later scores of
curious Lagunita girls were mingling
outside the room, forming a barri
cade to keep the Farm's Firemen
from doing their duties.
In the meantime, Mrs. Frances
Neilson, Lagunita Director, was wad
ing through the lake of water in the
room, helping Shirley remove her
furniture, books, and articles and
piling them in the corridor.
Two engines from the Firehouse
were on the scene. And once again
Lagunita's Casa Naranja broke the
monotony of "another day."
