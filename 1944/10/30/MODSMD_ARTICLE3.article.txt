# Students Give Political Views Wednesday Eve
## 
### 
Although speakers participating in
political discussions to take place in
the Education Auditorium Wednes
day evening at 7:30 have not yet been
chosen, Leonard Low, election chair
man, stated that members of Elliot
Epsteen's newly-formed Stanford
Discussion Union will take active
parts in the program.
The Stanford Young Democrats
Association, newest political organ
ization on campus, is also expecting
to give its side of the story when
the discussion is opened to the floor.
"The speeches will not be debates
in the strictest sense of the word,"
Low said, "but, rather, each speaker
presenting his views on the election
to the assembly."
Although the locations of the polls
in Thursday's Mock-Election are still
undecided, committee members feel
that such information should be
available tomorrow morning.
Tentative plans are underway con
cerning the counting of ballots, in
which it may be determined how the
student vote is affected when the
ballots are tallied by class and sex.
Such results will be posted in the
Stanford Daily Friday morning.
All students are asked to attend
Wednesday night's discussions and
present their views—pro, con, or
non-partis£fri—to the gathering, since
no other political rallies or debates
are anticipated during this year's
election.
