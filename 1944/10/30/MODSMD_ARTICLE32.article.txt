# Farm's Corp Yard Keeps Water Tasty And Makes Repairs
## 
### JANE McENTIRE 
Obvious things that happen on
Che Farm, like Halloween dances,
Shaughnessy Shows, and Civ lec
tures, don't need much explaining
to the Campus Indian. But there are
other goings-on that don't meet his
eye so readily, and if he stops to
think about it.the suspicious War
rior may well ask just where the
Ititle men who paint, polish, and
plumb around the Farm come from
anyway.
The Corp Yard, as the workers
fondly call it, exists to maintain the
public utilities, make repairs, and
keep the Stanford community 'gus
sied-up." While the gas and elec
tricity actually comes from the P.G.
and E.. the amounts are regulated
and clocked in the Corp Yard. The
water supply, too, is under the juris
diction of the Yard. Perhaps many
of you Stanford lads and lasses are
discovering that our University is
graced with two kinds of water: the
domestic or "with chlorine," and the
plain, or "irrigation" variety. It is
the job of certain men on duty at the
Yard to keep the chlorine percentage
at the level where it will kill the
most bacteria and, if possible, taste
the least.
Array of Duties
The Yard has under its wing a
magnificent array of departments
which give an idea of the scope of
the place. The Carpentering, Black
smithing (iron work), Electric, En
gineering, Gardening, Labor, Me
chanician, Painting, and Plumbing
Departments cover almost all the
maintenance duties around the Farm
from cleaning the streets to mending
fine instruments from adjacent labo
ratories.
The hierarchy of the Corp Yard
goes like this: there is a Department
Supervisor who has the responsi
bility of seeing the foremen of the
various divisions just listed run
smoothly. Most of the employees
are skilled carpentefs and mechan
ics, but there are a few students
who work in the engineering labora- !
lories on night-duty—especially if
their college work fits this field.
Includes County Officers
Fire and Police Departments, also !
a part of the Corp Yard.organization, !
are staffed by county officers, and j
they are paid, like everyone else at
the Yard, out of the University's j
purse.
Stanfordites who didn't know what j
the Yard was, before stumbling on j
this "piece" were paying the insti
tution its greatest compliment.

public utilities, make repairs, and
keep the Stanford community 'gus
sied-up." While the gas and elec
tricity actually comes from the P.G.
and E.. the amounts are regulated
and clocked in the Corp Yard. The
water supply, too, is under the juris
diction of the Yard. Perhaps many
of you Stanford lads and lasses are
discovering that our University is
graced with two kinds of water: the
domestic or "with chlorine," and the
plain, or "irrigation" variety. It is
the job of certain men on duty at the
Yard to keep the chlorine percentage
at the level where it will kill the
most bacteria and, if possible, taste
the least.
Array of Duties
The Yard has under its wing a
magnificent array of departments
which give an idea of the scope of
the place. The Carpentering, Black
smithing (iron work), Electric, En
gineering, Gardening, Labor, Me
chanician, Painting, and Plumbing
Departments cover almost all the
maintenance duties around the Farm
from cleaning the streets to mending
fine instruments from adjacent labo
ratories.
The hierarchy of the Corp Yard
goes like this: there is a Department
Supervisor who has the responsi
bility of seeing the foremen of the
various divisions just listed run
smoothly. Most of the employees
are skilled carpentefs and mechan
ics, but there are a few students
who work in the engineering labora- !
lories on night-duty—especially if
their college work fits this field.
Includes County Officers
Fire and Police Departments, also !
a part of the Corp Yard.organization, !
are staffed by county officers, and j
they are paid, like everyone else at
the Yard, out of the University's j
purse.
Stanfordites who didn't know what j
the Yard was, before stumbling on j
this "piece" were paying the insti
tution its greatest compliment.
Obvious things that happen on
Che Farm, like Halloween dances,
Shaughnessy Shows, and Civ lec
tures, don't need much explaining
to the Campus Indian. But there are
other goings-on that don't meet his
eye so readily, and if he stops to
think about it.the suspicious War
rior may well ask just where the
Ititle men who paint, polish, and
plumb around the Farm come from
anyway.
The Corp Yard, as the workers
fondly call it, exists to maintain the
public utilities, make repairs, and
keep the Stanford community 'gus
