# Bandage Minimum Asked of Women
## 
### 
So great was the response to the
call for bandage rollers that Marie
Wagner, head of surgical dressings,
has asked that women go only at the
hours for which they signed, and re
main for one hour only.
The surgical dressing room has fa
cilities for only 15 girls an hour, but
plans may be formulated to allow
girls to stay longer, Miss Wagner
stated. Until then women are asked
to attend regularly and help to main
tain the 3,000 dressings-a-week aver
age.
