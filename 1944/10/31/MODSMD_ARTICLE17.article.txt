# BULL SESSION
## 
### Dick Crane 
Today is guest session day, and the far-famed editor of the
Chaparral was supposed to write the daily comment. As a mat
ter of fact he did, but the damn thing got lost somewhere on the
campus, so I guess I will have to write today's episode myself.
As I hadn't planned on writing today's column, I'm afraid
just miscellaneous bits of information will have to suffice, and
for that matter, damn little of that.
Roos Brothers are sponsoring an all-campus bridge tourna
ment at the "Shack" near the Bookstore sometime in the very
near future. The date will be announced in the Stanford Daily,
so grab yourself a guy (or gal), practice up a bit, and prepare to
leave your name to posterity.
If you win, you will be more famous than if you happened
to go Phi Bete. One more thing on the subject of bridge, they
are giving free "refreshments" and cigarettes while you play,
and also some pretty nice prizes.
"Any fraternity house on the Stanford campus can open its
doors if they are financially able, and have the University's per
mission; however, even if the houses are financially able to
open, they can't do it, because the University won't give its
permission," says the president of Interfraternity Board. (Col
umnist's note to the board): The next time you call a meeting,
be sure you have something to say.
Everyone is wondering who the character was that Wcis dressed
up in a mask and virtually driving three of the U.S. Navy's favor
ite ensigns from our fair campus. All this happened on Sunday
morning in the vicinity of the former Kappa House. It is my
warning to all men on campus to be sure and carry a club or
gun if you are walking alone in that vicinity, and to be espe
cially careful if it is after darkâ€”the ratio is tough enough now,
without making things more rugged.
