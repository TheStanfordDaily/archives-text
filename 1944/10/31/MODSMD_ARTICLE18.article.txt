To the Editor:
An envelope came into the A.S.S.U.
office last week addressed to the
'Women's Vice-President, Student
Union, Stanford College, Los An
geles. California"; it contained two
very remarkable letters written U>
the Stanford Women from two Royal
New Zealand Air Force men sta
tioned in the South Pacific.
It seems that there is a spirit of
competition between the northern
and southern islands of New Zea
land. So when a group of men on
this particular air base started com
paring the Stanford coeds (whom
they had seen in the Pathe Short)
to the Texas University coeds( whom
they had seen in Life magazine),
m argument ensued.
The men from the northern island
>1 New Zealand defended the glory
it Stanford womanhood, while the
nen from the southern island, pure
y out of the spirit of competition,
[ in sure, stuck up for the Texas girls.
They decided that the people in
volved should settle the question.

Two of them have written to Texas,
i and two of them, Des Boyle and Bill ■
' Newell, have written to us: uncon
ditional superiority will be granted
the women who come through with
i the greater .response.
The letters are both very cleverly
written and certainly deserve some
consideration. As Bill says, "As it is,
they can climb palm trees faster than I
I can, and if they can also say that
they know the Texas women are bet
ter than the ones farther north, then
I will have very little left but to cut
I my throat on a bump of coral and
pine miserably away."
I'm enclosing the addresses of both ,
I of the men (who, incidentally, claim
i to be "six feet high," twentj'-one
years old, and unmarried), so the
I Stanford women may do whatever
pleases them on this subject of inter
! national importance.
The addresses are: N2 439831,
' L.A.C Boyle D. M„ RNZAF. N2APO
318: and L.A.C. Newell W. H., N2 !
426539, NZAPO 3IS
