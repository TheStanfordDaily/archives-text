# Mining Vital after War Says Frederick Tickell
## 
### 
"The mining engineering department is now engaged with post-war
planning," Frederick G. Tickell, department head, said in a recent inter
view. Mining engineering will be vital alter the war as always in de
veloping latent natural resources and discovering new ones as the old
sources of supply, heavily taxed by production geared for war, run out.

The mining engineering depart
ment is divided into three sub-de
partments:. metallurgy, mines, and
petroleum technology.
Dr. Tickell himself was petroleum
engineer for Southern Pacific Rail
way Company and subsidiaries be
fore his annex as head of the mines
department in 1921. Stanford was
his first teaching position, and now,
along with his other duties as de
partment chief, he acts as consulting
engineer for several oil companies.
A graduate of Cal's school of mines
in 1912, he received his degree as
petroleum engineer there in 1927.
Now he lives with his family in Palo
Alto. His daughter Jean is a Stan
ford graduate of 1942 in psychology.
Dr. Tickell has watched the growth
of many departments and activities,
and has seen Stanford expand later
ally a good deal. In his own depart
ment, much valuable equipment has
been added from time to time to the
physical plant. The most recent of
these laboratory assessments is a
universal testing machine.
Although Dr. Tickell's stall has
been reduced somewhat during the
war. 12 graduate students are en
rolled. "A very good registration for
a war year," he said.
Dr. Tickell does not administer his
own curriculum, as engineering un
dergraduates are required to take a
more or less general course. Thus
none are directly enrolled in mines,
but come back after graduation to
specialize and get degrees. Graduate
enrollment in peace times has gone
as high as 25 students, Tickell said.
However, chemistry and geology are
closely allied with the mining engi
neering field and students of those
schools enroll in mines lab courses.
Tickell was born in Ottowa, Can
ada, but considers himself an Amer
ican as he has lived most of his life
here .

planning," Frederick G. Tickell, department head, said in a recent inter
view. Mining engineering will be vital alter the war as always in de
veloping latent natural resources and discovering new ones as the old
sources of supply, heavily taxed by production geared for war, run out.

The mining engineering depart
ment is divided into three sub-de
partments:. metallurgy, mines, and
petroleum technology.
Dr. Tickell himself was petroleum
engineer for Southern Pacific Rail
way Company and subsidiaries be
fore his annex as head of the mines
department in 1921. Stanford was
his first teaching position, and now,
along with his other duties as de
partment chief, he acts as consulting
engineer for several oil companies.
A graduate of Cal's school of mines
in 1912, he received his degree as
petroleum engineer there in 1927.
Now he lives with his family in Palo
Alto. His daughter Jean is a Stan
ford graduate of 1942 in psychology.
Dr. Tickell has watched the growth
of many departments and activities,
and has seen Stanford expand later
ally a good deal. In his own depart
ment, much valuable equipment has
been added from time to time to the
physical plant. The most recent of
these laboratory assessments is a
universal testing machine.
Although Dr. Tickell's stall has
been reduced somewhat during the
war. 12 graduate students are en
rolled. "A very good registration for
a war year," he said.
Dr. Tickell does not administer his
own curriculum, as engineering un
dergraduates are required to take a
more or less general course. Thus
none are directly enrolled in mines,
but come back after graduation to
specialize and get degrees. Graduate
enrollment in peace times has gone
as high as 25 students, Tickell said.
However, chemistry and geology are
closely allied with the mining engi
neering field and students of those
schools enroll in mines lab courses.
Tickell was born in Ottowa, Can
ada, but considers himself an Amer
ican as he has lived most of his life
here .
"The mining engineering department is now engaged with post-war
planning," Frederick G. Tickell, department head, said in a recent inter
