Cheers, songsâ€”and weinies (!) will

plenty of food to all hungry Stan

Sandwiches will be provided by
living groups; Cardinals will provide
weinies and rolls for barbecuing, and
will provide ice-cold cokes for sell

be in charge of food arrangements.
Students who weren't on campus
for the opening of the barbecue pit
last summer will have their oppor
tunity to officially christen it at its
first all-campus affair. A mass mi
gration to the Sunday Show at the
Memorial Auditorium will take place
at the close of the barbecue.
In preparation for the Cal-USC
game, Ric Supple will lead cheers
and songs so that Farm men and
women may exercise their vocal
chords and guarantee an all-time

Barbara Bonner will be in charge
of clean-up for the affair; students
may assist her by keeping trash and
waste food in the trash boxes,
