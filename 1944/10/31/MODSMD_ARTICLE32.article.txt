• Sinking farther into a cesspool of
j ignorance, the five Daily football
"experts" failed to do any better
than last week in their predictions,
and, as a matter of fact, did worse,
averaging only 10 out of 15 games
! each.
Gordon Levy lead Hie field this
week by picking 11 for 15, getting
his edge over the other experts by
j predicting Michigan's decisive vic
! Tory over Purdue.
j The Eggsperts
1 Weinberg, Cohen, and yours truly
j came in next with 10 for 15, and
"Bilge" Adams wound up with 9 for
| 15.
I Seasonal averages are Adams,
| Weinberg, and Cohen, 70., Levy, 66.6,
! and Gugel trailing at a poor 63,3, a
gain of 3.3 over last week.
The two games which really threw
the experts were the Texas-Rice
: game and the Cal-Washington. The
[ five were all on the Texas and Cal
j bandwagons. Cal was massacred by
i Washington, 33-7, and Rice toppled
' Texas 7-0.
What Happened to Huskies
Afetr witnessing the Cal-Wash
j ington game, this writer finds it
j hard to believe that Washington
j could be as decisively defeated by
j U.S.C. as it was. In the Cal game,
J the Huskies looked better than any
j college team on the coast in the last
Iwo years and far better than when
we saw U.S.C. this year.
As it looks now, Cal might win
one of their four remaining games
iif they're lucky, especially since
j «ome of their best Navy players are
j being moved. No doubt the sports
writers who picked Cal for the Rose
I Bowl are bald now from tearing
I their hair. *
