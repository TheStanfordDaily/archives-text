j Take out a handful of nickels
j from that worn-out poeket, Hip each !
one three times, and you'll have as j
j good a guess as anyone else on the
I winner in the intramural football j
j race which starts on its merry way I
i this afternoon at 4:30.
Coach Elwyn Bugge, acting head j
' of intramural sports, has divided the !
] fifteen teams into two leagues of |
1 equal strength. All teams are to play i
I on four assigned areas, two games ■
1 being played in each area every
Tuesday and Thursday. According to j
i Bugge, all games should be played i
| if weather permits, only an earth- }
quake should cause postponement.

j behind the varsity tennis courts. (
Field II is the varsity practice turf, j
] inclosed by wooden fences. Field 111
, lies directly behind the varsity lot,

freshman field. Field IV lies to the
i left of the varsity and freshman turfs, j
' For actual locations; see the chart ;

mid-stripe only. Halves of 20 min- j
I utes and fields 60 yards long by 40 j
; yards wide have been agreed upon, j
| For the first time in years, however, I
