# Chappie, "It's the Nuts," So Says Barney Gugel
## 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
'.'The Spring Chappie was the bees patella; the Summer Chappie was <<
LuLu, but the 45th Anniversary Chappie beats them all. It's the nuts."
So stated Old Boy Barney Gugel, when eornered by your Daily reporter
at a well-known El Camino sanitarium.
Your reporter was then corraled by Chappie Business Manager, Bill

Gilbert, who after snarling like an
animal for a few minutes, remarked,
"The anniversary Chappie, bigeer
and better than ever, 40—Beautiful
Pages—4o, will be sold on Quad on
and about Nov. 10. Everyone should
plan to buy a couple of extra copies
to send to friends and former Stan
lord students in the service."
'"This 40 page issue will sell at the
new all-time low price of 25 ceiji
added Gugel. M.E. Dick Fayram and
Gilbert nodded with approval and
again cornered your reporter in one
of the booths, where they lustfully
told her of the 9 page cartoon spread
and the twelve beautiful pages of
ads. Old Boy Gugel now began to
babble incoherently about Fables,
Queens, a 4 color photographic
cover, and why your reporter should
go to his car for a few moments.
Your reporter was miraculously
saved when the three realized thu'
they were due back at Agnew and
left hurriedly, singing the famous
three part, three voice mirror fugue.
"It'l tickle yo livah, it'l split y.
guts.
Buy a hundred copies; de Chap
pie's de nuts."
