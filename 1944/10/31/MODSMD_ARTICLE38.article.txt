CASANOVA BROWN—now playing I
at the Stanford Theater.
"Casanova Brown," with Gary
Cooper in the title role, is another
satire on marriage and family that's
mildly amusing at times but more
often bogs down due to dreary dia
logue and situations.
Cooper, a mild-mannered college j
professor, is about to marry Anita j
Louise when he receives a most em
barrassing letter from a Chicago
maternity hospital. It seems that
Gary's previous marriage to Teresa !
Wright had been productive so he |
hurries to Chicago and kidnaps his
baby. Gary tends the child in a hotel j
room for two uninteresting reels un
til a repentent Miss Wright strolls ;
onto the set and all is well again in J
Magic Movieland.
Frank Morgan as Miss Louise's !
dour father gives the only convint- !
ing performance as Cooper is his j
usual typed self and Miss Wright
does nothing but whine throughout
the film.
"Casanova Brown" puts this re
viewer in a state of languid boredom
and will probably have the same I
deadening effect on you.
When Charles R. Rogers produced
"Powers Girl," even Hollywood
blushed in shame. Now Charlie has
made "Song of the Open Road," in
which the sordid adventures of a
motley crew of teen-age crop pickers

are featured. A little wench named
Jane Powell has the lead and sings
while picking oranges. Run, do nc
walk to the nearest exit. —Dick
