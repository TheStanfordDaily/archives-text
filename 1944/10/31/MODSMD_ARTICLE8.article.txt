into a tangled swamp land next to the river Maas farther east.

► In twenty-four hours, Sir Bernard
L. Montgomery's hard-hitting armies
have reduced the enemy holdings be
low Maas by one-third and at many
points the German defense was disin
tegrating into riotous flight for safety
by small boats and pontoon bridges.
From Roosendaal, the Canadians
smashed onto Oud' Tastel, twenty
j miles below and six miles from the
| Willemstad ferry station at the mouth
of the Holland Deez. the turbid es
