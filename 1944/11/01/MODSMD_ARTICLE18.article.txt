# STANFORD WOMEN, UNITE
## 
### 
Because of the space difficulties which the Daily always faces
tabloid size, it was not possible yesterday to give as much im
portance as we would have liked, to the letter from A.S.S.U.
vice-president Barbara Upshaw, about the international rivalry
now raging among New Zealand troops in the South Seas over
the merits of Stanford coeds vs. those of Texas.
The extreme significance of this just challenge from the Pa
cific must be apparent to all Stanford v/omen who threw the
challenge from the University-across-the bay to sell bonds back
in their ugly bear-trap last year.
Now in the far away Pacific Stanford Womenhood shall be
judged against the comelies of the Lone Star State by their letter
writing capacity, and it must be confessed that New Zealand
soldiers who use such wily methods to gain correspondence
should not be unrewarded.
So when you're turning out that batch of letters this week,
turn out one more for Bill Newell and or Des Boyle to let the men
down under know Stanford never ignores a challenge, or loses
one either without a fight. Women of Stanford Unite!
