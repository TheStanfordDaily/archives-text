### Dick Crane 
The coke machine that never works, the trash so thick on the
floor, that one has to back out the door, the lewd pictures and
clippings on the wall, all go together to make up the congenial
atmosphere of the Daily Shack.
If you have ever taken a good look at the place from behind
the bushes concealing it, you will have a very clear answer as
to why this building, faintly resembling a—What was I saying?—
is hidden. This little wooden structure was built, I imagine,
shortly after the great earthquake, and on the accumulated
budget of the A.S.S.U. year after year, so you can see how we
stand with the student government.
As you first walk in the door of the "Shack," you will notice
a rather large office to your right. This is known as the business
office, and is run very (competently) by "Wild" Bill Conley.
Then, looking left, you will see the editor's office, but you won't
see him, because he will no doubt be down the highway, gath
ering material for his daily feature, "Up and Down the Highway
With Stanford." Proceeding along the tremendous corridor (10
feet), you gradually work your way to the copy room, where
you will see the sports staff huddled in a corner diligently play
ing with blocks, and picking "lousy" football scores' for the
coming weekend, and "chiseling" on their averages of last
week's games.
A crowd of newspeople are gathered around the copy desk
and everyone is busily engaged. Paper is flying all over the
place, and in general, very much commotion. Suddenly from
out of this tumult comes the clarion call, 'I bid four spades."
We get the paper out every day too!
The door bursts open, and a nervous little freshman reporter
staggers in and says,"I waited in the Memorial Aud. until four
a.m. for that meeting that was supposed to take place at seven
p.m., do you think it was alright for me to leave? as it never did
take place."
Finally, if you look over in the far corner, you will notice the
main attraction of our little abode. There he is folks! our theater
critic, with his ulcers, corns, sinus trouble, and various other
ailments. He is mad at the world, and muttering to himself,
"Gable stinks"; "Lamarr is terrible"; "I have never seen the
damn show, but I wouldn't like it, even if it was good."
I hope I have given all you readers, a picturesque description
of our campus newspaper, and I would like to have you come in
md look the place over sometime. I warn you not to stay long,
oecause someone will sure as hell put you to work. You don't
iave to be crazy to work on The Stanford Daily, but it sure
•u-'lps.

of our campus newspaper, and I would like to have you come in
md look the place over sometime. I warn you not to stay long,
oecause someone will sure as hell put you to work. You don't
iave to be crazy to work on The Stanford Daily, but it sure
•u-'lps.
The coke machine that never works, the trash so thick on the
floor, that one has to back out the door, the lewd pictures and
clippings on the wall, all go together to make up the congenial
atmosphere of the Daily Shack.
If you have ever taken a good look at the place from behind
the bushes concealing it, you will have a very clear answer as
to why this building, faintly resembling a—What was I saying?—
is hidden. This little wooden structure was built, I imagine,
shortly after the great earthquake, and on the accumulated
budget of the A.S.S.U. year after year, so you can see how we
stand with the student government.
As you first walk in the door of the "Shack," you will notice
a rather large office to your right. This is known as the business
office, and is run very (competently) by "Wild" Bill Conley.
Then, looking left, you will see the editor's office, but you won't
see him, because he will no doubt be down the highway, gath
ering material for his daily feature, "Up and Down the Highway
With Stanford." Proceeding along the tremendous corridor (10
feet), you gradually work your way to the copy room, where
you will see the sports staff huddled in a corner diligently play
ing with blocks, and picking "lousy" football scores' for the
coming weekend, and "chiseling" on their averages of last
week's games.
A crowd of newspeople are gathered around the copy desk
and everyone is busily engaged. Paper is flying all over the
place, and in general, very much commotion. Suddenly from
out of this tumult comes the clarion call, 'I bid four spades."
We get the paper out every day too!
The door bursts open, and a nervous little freshman reporter
staggers in and says,"I waited in the Memorial Aud. until four
a.m. for that meeting that was supposed to take place at seven
p.m., do you think it was alright for me to leave? as it never did
take place."
Finally, if you look over in the far corner, you will notice the
main attraction of our little abode. There he is folks! our theater
critic, with his ulcers, corns, sinus trouble, and various other
ailments. He is mad at the world, and muttering to himself,
"Gable stinks"; "Lamarr is terrible"; "I have never seen the
damn show, but I wouldn't like it, even if it was good."
I hope I have given all you readers, a picturesque description
of our campus newspaper, and I would like to have you come in
md look the place over sometime. I warn you not to stay long,
oecause someone will sure as hell put you to work. You don't
