# TUESDAY SERIES REVIEW
## Bradley Claims Present War Election Composite of Others 
### 
"History never really repeats itself, in war elections," declared Professor
Harold Bradley, associate professor of history, at the Tuesday Evening
Series last night in Memorial Hall.
"This election is a composite of past war elections with many similar
features of the elections of 1864 and of 1920, but still many of the issues

involved are different," he stated. 4
"To predict today's election one
must consult the crystal ball and
cross one's fingers, and breathe eas- ,
ily," he added.
"In the Civil War election of 1864 j
the Democrats attacked Lincoln's
party, accusing it of inefficiency in
war conduct and of bungling domes
tic policies," he noted. "Soldiers took
a greater interest in politics than the
soldiers of today, though only 11 of
25 states allowed the soldiers to
vote."
"Despite the controversy the party
in power was re-elected to continue
the war effort," he stated.
"In the post World War election of j
1920 Harding ran on a platform of i
"Back to Normalcy," accusing Wil- j
son's administration of highhanded
ness in administration of domestic i
affairs and of inefficiency in handling j
of foreign affairs.
"The Republicans were tired of re
form," Bradley emphasized.
The Republicans won an over
whelming victory most probably on
domestic issues rather than on the
controversial League of Nations is
sue.
Professor Bradley was introduced
by Dr. Chilton R. Bush, head of pub
lic exercises and of the department
of journalism.
