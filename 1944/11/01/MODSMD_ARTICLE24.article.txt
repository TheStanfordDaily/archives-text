## 
### 
Plenty of speed and experience
| faced Coach Bill Brown at the first
practice of his Toyon Dead End Kids
last Saturday. The Kids, gathered
; from Toyon's lower floor, open
against the Med School today in the
intramural league formed last week,
i Brown will hold down one of the
! end positions for the Kids. All 190
j pounds of him got three years' of
| experience at Hoover High in San
| Diego, a fact which makes him a
! strong wingman. Holding down the
j other end of the line will be Jack
I Bradt, tricky blocker and steady
j pass receiver from Phoenix, Arizona,
! who tips the scales at 185 pounds.
Chuck Dickman, a vet from Har
i lowton High in Montana, fills the
[ center of the line and also does
i some pretty fair punting.
( John Murry, speedy halfback
from Los Angeles, is slated to start
| in the backfiejd along with Ben Bok,
; who played three years at Harvard
j Military Academy and tosses some
mean aerials.
Brown boasts an all-conference
back from Watsonville High in Ed
Hall, 175 pound defensive wizard.
1 Hall will most likely spark the Dead

Enders' attack from his quarter spot.
Coach Bl own indicated that he will
have five reserves in Tom Lindbergh
and Ray Ryan, ends; Bob Kincaid
and Bob Gettys, halves; and Jerry
Matin, alternating backfield man.
Toyon's operators, blessed with
even a nickname are due to pull
their share of upsets, according to
Jerry Goss and A 1 Crawford, co
coaches. Goss names Bill Keeler
and Lonnie Pierce to start at the end
positions. Pierce played for Lin
coln Hall last quarter, while Keeler,
a rugged blocker, had three years of
high school experience.
Goss selected his cohort Crawford,
with experience from Santa Ana
High, to play center. Crawford. 175
pound defensive stalwart, appears to
be the most promising player on the
squad.
Co-coach Crawford took over the
talking chores and named Goss. Joe
Balestra, and Bob Stevens promis
ing backs. Stevens, with a year of
JC experience, will handle the quar
ter duties. Balestra is a blocking
back from Pittsburgh.
Alternating at the other halfback
position will be John Newcomer and

Tony Ortega, 160 pound offensive
threats.
In the way of reserves, Toyon's
second story men have Jack Gilli
land. Dave Barry, Mel Cruesers, John
Loveen, and Pat Phillips.
