# For the Day of Peace-Postwar Organization
## 
### BERNADETTE GIANNINI 
(Editorial note—This article introduces a series to follow twice a week
in the Daily, which will try to consider one of today's most vital problems:
probabilities and problems in post-war organization to maintain peaceful
relations throughout the world.
The Daily has gained consent of several of Stanford's noted authorities

on various phases of the questions*
involved for interviews to present a
full discussion of current informa
tion.
Among the professors who have
consented to interviews are Profes
sors Graham Stuart, Ralph 11. Lutz,
11. 11. Fisher, Edwin A. Cotlrell,
Philip W. Buck, and Theodore H.
Boggs.
The interviews will be centered on
specific questions, as they are raised,
and graphic presentation of conclu
sions will be attempted. Of vital
necessity to the usefulness of the se
ries will be comments and suggested
themes for questions from students.)
A welter of hysteric speculation
and anxious forboding surrounds the
plans, or lack of plans, to which the
world is to turn at the approach of
peace.
Many men of sound knowledge
and judgment such as Sumner
Welles and Walter Lippman have
offered extensive studies of the ques
ion and guide us in our interpre
tation of current events, conferences
and the public utterances of the men
who will formulate the guiding prin
ciples of the post-war world.
The Time for Decision
Two years ago the Daily ran a
series of articles, interviews with
Stanford Professors who were con
cerned with the evaluation of the
possibilities for a peaceful world
after the war.
Now the Prime Minister of Britain
has said that the war should be over
entirely by the end of next year, and
the Daily is going to ask these men
again how the tumultuous events of
he past two years in which our arm
ies have swept from forced retreat
to world-wide victory, has modified
jr developed their estimates of the
United Nations' efforts for a peace
ful world after this war.
The Right Hand Watches the Left
We now know more about our al
lies, the USSR has shown its oppo
sition to British plans for a future

Poland, while making deliberate con
cessions at the great monetary con
ference at Bretton Woods. We need
to know what this indicates.
We know more about what the
structure of Europe will be; the
DeGaulle government, though op
posed in Washington and London
until the last possible moment, looks
firmly accepted by France; the war
has not unrooted Franco, and Rus
sian negotiations in the Balkans have
been carried out apparently accord
ing to an overall United Nations
plan.
When consultation has been the
keynote of United Nations decisions
Americans have confidence; but se
crecy involving detailed plans, has
discouraged a hopeful American
public.
Therefore it is hoped that this se
ries of articles can provide interpre
tive information about current ac
tions, and a guide to the future
course of events which, as students,
we should know.
But Do We Believe It
We have this statement by Walter
Lippman about the American con
tribution to an effort, which is now
world-wide, made with tools of
knowledge and understanding, gen
erosity, and tolerance:
"The American idea is not an ec
centricity in the history of man
kind. It is a hope and a pledge of
fulfillment. The American idea is
founded upon an image of a man
and his place in the universe, of his
reason and his will, his knowledge
of good and evil, his hope of a higher
and a natural law which is above all
governments, and indeed of all par
ticular laws. This tradition descends
to America as to all Westerners,
from the Mediterranean world of
ancient Greeks, Hebrews, and Ro
mans."
It is America's stake and Amer
ica's weapon in the post-war efforts
for world peace that we are going to
talk about in this series of articles.

peace.
Many men of sound knowledge
and judgment such as Sumner
Welles and Walter Lippman have
offered extensive studies of the ques
ion and guide us in our interpre
tation of current events, conferences
and the public utterances of the men
who will formulate the guiding prin
ciples of the post-war world.
The Time for Decision
Two years ago the Daily ran a
series of articles, interviews with
Stanford Professors who were con
cerned with the evaluation of the
possibilities for a peaceful world
after the war.
Now the Prime Minister of Britain
has said that the war should be over
entirely by the end of next year, and
the Daily is going to ask these men
again how the tumultuous events of
he past two years in which our arm
ies have swept from forced retreat
to world-wide victory, has modified
jr developed their estimates of the
United Nations' efforts for a peace
ful world after this war.
The Right Hand Watches the Left
We now know more about our al
lies, the USSR has shown its oppo
sition to British plans for a future

Poland, while making deliberate con
cessions at the great monetary con
ference at Bretton Woods. We need
to know what this indicates.
We know more about what the
structure of Europe will be; the
DeGaulle government, though op
posed in Washington and London
until the last possible moment, looks
firmly accepted by France; the war
has not unrooted Franco, and Rus
sian negotiations in the Balkans have
been carried out apparently accord
ing to an overall United Nations
plan.
When consultation has been the
keynote of United Nations decisions
Americans have confidence; but se
crecy involving detailed plans, has
discouraged a hopeful American
public.
Therefore it is hoped that this se
ries of articles can provide interpre
tive information about current ac
tions, and a guide to the future
course of events which, as students,
we should know.
But Do We Believe It
We have this statement by Walter
Lippman about the American con
tribution to an effort, which is now
world-wide, made with tools of
knowledge and understanding, gen
erosity, and tolerance:
"The American idea is not an ec
centricity in the history of man
kind. It is a hope and a pledge of
fulfillment. The American idea is
founded upon an image of a man
and his place in the universe, of his
reason and his will, his knowledge
of good and evil, his hope of a higher
and a natural law which is above all
governments, and indeed of all par
ticular laws. This tradition descends
to America as to all Westerners,
from the Mediterranean world of
ancient Greeks, Hebrews, and Ro
mans."
It is America's stake and Amer
ica's weapon in the post-war efforts
for world peace that we are going to
talk about in this series of articles.
(Editorial note—This article introduces a series to follow twice a week
in the Daily, which will try to consider one of today's most vital problems:
probabilities and problems in post-war organization to maintain peaceful
relations throughout the world.
The Daily has gained consent of several of Stanford's noted authorities

on various phases of the questions*
involved for interviews to present a
full discussion of current informa
tion.
Among the professors who have
consented to interviews are Profes
sors Graham Stuart, Ralph 11. Lutz,
11. 11. Fisher, Edwin A. Cotlrell,

Boggs.
The interviews will be centered on
specific questions, as they are raised,
and graphic presentation of conclu
sions will be attempted. Of vital
necessity to the usefulness of the se

themes for questions from students.)
