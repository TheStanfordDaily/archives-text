# Brainier Date Bureau Offers Solution For Man Shortage
## 
### MAIMON MORROW 
Someone walked up dismally yesterday and sighed, "Why doesn't the
Daily print an article on how to get a man for the Branner-Roble-Ventura
formal, "La Victoire Parisienne," Women's Gym, November 11, refresh
ments, entertainment, and so on?" (Plug, plug).
It must be admitted that how to meet a man on the Stanford campus

at present is a problem, but it has
been noted on good authority by the
Branner-Roble-Ventura authorities
that many and many a good man
pines alone in his lonely room in
ignorance of how to know even one
equally lonely coed.
Seeing as how that is the case, the
BWOC contingent of the various
halls have decided to advocate to
each and every prospective attender
of "La Victoire Parisienne" a new
type of Blind Date —one which will
take into consideration the personal
side of both parties concerned.
This super Blind Date Bureau
plans to have a personal interview
with all the fellows and gals and
then match them according to their
respective qualifications. The sys
tem has been tried once before on a
large scale at Branner and was found
very successful.
Then, of course, for the skeptics in
the crowd there's always the fool
proof method of asking your best
girl friend, who has a friend, who
knows a man whose grandmother
had an uncle, who sent a son to

Stanford five years ago, to get you
a date. Many times these dates are
more advantageous than the Bureau
type, since you know some one in
volved, even though it's only the
grandmother's cat.
If you are interested in procuring
one of these fate-fixers, visit the
Blind Date Chairman in your hall.
When November 11 lolls around,
you'll be sorry if you haven't.
