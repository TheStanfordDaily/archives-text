# STANFORD POLITICS
## 
### 
Although the majority of Stanford students are under 21, this
will not disenfranchise them in the mock election to be held
tomorrow from 8:30 to 2:30.
The ballots will list the two major presidential candidates,
! senatorial candidates, and will be available in polls at the Engi
neering and History corners. The results will indicate Stanford
voting according to sex, age, and political sentiment.
Tonight a debate will be held, with a discussion of the Re
publican and Democratic parties, platforms, and candidates, in
the Education Auditorium at 7:30. Every thinking Stanford stu
dent will be present to participate in this discussion, and to argue
for his favorite candidate in the Stanford elections.
It is a fine way to be in on history, and as it is an all-campus
function, everyone should be present at tonight's program.
The Thursday mock election can be a valuable indication of
the ability of Stanford students to decide political issues for
themselves, and to back up the correct interpretation of politics
with a vote.
But you will need the student body card, so dig it out, make up
your mind for yourself—regardless of any other influence—and
vote tomorrow!
