WASHINGTON. Nov. 1 (U.R)-A
Japanese broadcast said today that

I American B-29 superfortresses, big
gest planes in the world, had raided
Tokyo by broad daylightâ€”thus real
izing at last the war-long dream of
l American airmen to bring the enemy
112 capital within range of land based
j heavy bombers.
Tokyo described a dramatic aerial
j battle over the capital amidst the
thunder of anti-aircraft guns. For
some hours the enemy broadcast
were indefinite whether the B-29's
had bombed the city. The broadcast
characteristically sought to give the
impression that the raid was small
j and unimportant and that the super-
I fortresses were chased away "with
out achieving their objectives."
Later a Japanese broadcast to In
dia, heard by FFC listeners, said that
the planes were forced away "with
out dropping a single bomb," and
j that the raid was made "for recon
j naissance purposes, also for political
! effect in the presidential campaign,
;ind also to interfere with Japanese
| offensive operations in the Philip
pines."
Japanese radio commentators,
however, warned that Japanese

homes were "fire traps" and urged
extreme precautions to prevent
spread of fires as the result of Amer
ican attacks which might be ex
pected.
