###

gress.
Polling booths will be situated in.
the Cellar, the English Corner, and

txends.
In the last election. Wendell Wi' 1 -
kie. Republican presidential nominee
in 1940, polled a ratio of three votes
to one against Roosevelt. Republican
victories have dominated every mock
election with the exception of the
1912 election when students voted for
Woodrow Wilson in favor of Theo
dore Roosevelt and William Howard
Taft.

As a prelude to today's mock
i election at Stanford, an all-Uni
! versity discussion was held lasi
| night in the Education Audito
rium, at which Stanford students
I were given an opportunity to de
-1 fend their 1944 presidential choice.

Leonard Low presided over the
discussion. Four prepared speeches
were given before the question was
thrown open for discussion from the
I floor. No poll was taken as to the
i opinion of the audience, as the mock
| election will determine the prefer
j ence of the students.
! Allen for Dewey
Morley Thompson and Charles
! Allen gave prepared speeches for
Governor Thomas E. Dewey. They
attempted to show that Dewey
would be superior to President I
Roosevelt in the conduct of both !
foreign and domestic affairs.
Thompson's chief issue was that
the New Deal must take the respon
sibility for the continuation of the
depression of the early 1930's even
after the other countries of the
world were on the road to recovery.
J i
Delegate Authority
Dewey and Pricker have consist
ently delegated authority to com
petent men, unlike President Roose
velt, the Republican speaker con
tended. They will be able to write
the record of the government in
black instead of red.
Allen pointed out failures of the |
present administration in foreign

i policy, emphasizing our policy con- ;
; cerning Poland and France.
Williams for Roosevelt
President Roosevelt was sup
ported by Donna Pickus and J. D.
Williams in prepared speeches. They j
contended that the basic, and by j
far the most important, issue in this |
campaign is the conduct of our for- \
eign policy in the postwar world.
Williams showed that good for
eign relations are necessflYy to do
mestic welfare and full employment j
at home. Full production is a pre
requisite for full employment, but
full production depends in turn upon j
| an adequate foreign market to bid j
! for our surplus goods. We must help |
to maintain purchasing power in I
foreign markets for our own eco-

I nomic welfare.
Isolationist Bloc
The Democratic speakers main
i tained tliat Roosevelt and the Demo-
I cratic party will be better able tc
[ prevent a return to isolationism aitei
| hte war than will Dewey. The Dem
j ocratic party does not have to buck
j an isolationist bloc within itself, as
do the Republicans.

As a prelude to today's mock
i election at Stanford, an all-Uni

rium, at which Stanford students
I were given an opportunity to de
-1 fend their 1944 presidential choice.

Leonard Low presided over the
discussion. Four prepared speeches
were given before the question was
thrown open for discussion from the
I floor. No poll was taken as to the
i opinion of the audience, as the mock
| election will determine the prefer
j ence of the students.
! Allen for Dewey
Morley Thompson and Charles
! Allen gave prepared speeches for
Governor Thomas E. Dewey. They
attempted to show that Dewey
would be superior to President I
Roosevelt in the conduct of both !
foreign and domestic affairs.
Thompson's chief issue was that
the New Deal must take the respon
sibility for the continuation of the
depression of the early 1930's even
after the other countries of the
world were on the road to recovery.
J i
Delegate Authority
Dewey and Pricker have consist
ently delegated authority to com
petent men, unlike President Roose
velt, the Republican speaker con
tended. They will be able to write
the record of the government in
black instead of red.
Allen pointed out failures of the |
present administration in foreign

i policy, emphasizing our policy con- ;
; cerning Poland and France.
Williams for Roosevelt
President Roosevelt was sup
ported by Donna Pickus and J. D.
Williams in prepared speeches. They j
contended that the basic, and by j
far the most important, issue in this |
campaign is the conduct of our for- \
eign policy in the postwar world.
Williams showed that good for
eign relations are necessflYy to do
mestic welfare and full employment j
at home. Full production is a pre
requisite for full employment, but
full production depends in turn upon j
| an adequate foreign market to bid j
! for our surplus goods. We must help |
to maintain purchasing power in I
foreign markets for our own eco-

I nomic welfare.
Isolationist Bloc
The Democratic speakers main
i tained tliat Roosevelt and the Demo-
I cratic party will be better able tc
[ prevent a return to isolationism aitei

j ocratic party does not have to buck
j an isolationist bloc within itself, as
do the Republicans.
Stanford students will go to the
polls today in a mock election to vote
for the men whom they think will be
most qualified to hold executive po
sitions in government offices. Al

logitn, votes will also be cast for
senators from California to the Con
