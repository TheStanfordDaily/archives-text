# MR. ROOSEVELT AND 1944
## 
### 
In 1940, on November 5, Dwight Hutchinson, editor of the
Daily, wrote a long editorial entitled, "We Want Roosevelt."
Dwight prefaced the editorial with, "I can say with all confidence
that my words will not seriously influence one single vote."
Dwight knew that he was writing an editorial contrary in
political sentiment to the 3 to 1 choice of Stanford students in
that election year: Wendell L. Willkie.
This editorial, written four years later, is an echo, for it is
contrary in political sentiment to that of the campus. It will not
influence a single vote, and it is at the same time a sincere
expression, not flippantly tossed in the faces of the campus
Republican majority." And it constitutes the "principal reasons
why I shall vote . . . for Franklin D. Roosevelt."
During the months of campaigning the Republican candidate
has failed to present a constructive program of action for the
domestic conduct of public affiars, and for participation in a
postwar international organization.
His political campaign has been negative, an attack on sup
posed Roosevelt inefficiency, yet he has promised nothing posi
tive —he has proposed no measures which can compare with the
benefits the people of the United States have gained from New
Deal legislation, or measures that can compare with the stature
the United States has achieved in international relations through
New Deal legislation and New Deal administration.
In short, the Republican candidate has merely offered to re
place the Roosevelt personality and party with the Dewey per
sonality and party. In 1944 this is not enough.
In 1944 the President of the United States must have an ad
ministrative type organization to run the war on the home front,
he must have a State Department with the know-how to set up
international relations so that Congress will have a chance to
legislate the United States into a postwar international organiza
tion; the President of the United States in 1944 must have the
popular support of the people, or the war cannot be prosecuted
most successfully, and the possibility of our participation in a
postwar international organization will be lessened.
The qualifications for President then, in this, our time, are:
1) ability to prosecute the war on the home front in the most
expedient manner;
12) lead the United States into a postwar international organiza
tion, to insure future peace;
r ,3) carry out both programs with the support of the people of the
United States.
Franklin Roosevelt fulfills the qualifications and he is the man
for the job.

sonality and party. In 1944 this is not enough.
In 1944 the President of the United States must have an ad
ministrative type organization to run the war on the home front,
he must have a State Department with the know-how to set up
international relations so that Congress will have a chance to
legislate the United States into a postwar international organiza
tion; the President of the United States in 1944 must have the
popular support of the people, or the war cannot be prosecuted
most successfully, and the possibility of our participation in a
postwar international organization will be lessened.
The qualifications for President then, in this, our time, are:
1) ability to prosecute the war on the home front in the most
expedient manner;
12) lead the United States into a postwar international organiza
tion, to insure future peace;
r ,3) carry out both programs with the support of the people of the
United States.
Franklin Roosevelt fulfills the qualifications and he is the man
for the job.
In 1940, on November 5, Dwight Hutchinson, editor of the
Daily, wrote a long editorial entitled, "We Want Roosevelt."
Dwight prefaced the editorial with, "I can say with all confidence
that my words will not seriously influence one single vote."
Dwight knew that he was writing an editorial contrary in
political sentiment to the 3 to 1 choice of Stanford students in
that election year: Wendell L. Willkie.
This editorial, written four years later, is an echo, for it is
contrary in political sentiment to that of the campus. It will not
influence a single vote, and it is at the same time a sincere
expression, not flippantly tossed in the faces of the campus
Republican majority." And it constitutes the "principal reasons
why I shall vote . . . for Franklin D. Roosevelt."
During the months of campaigning the Republican candidate
has failed to present a constructive program of action for the
domestic conduct of public affiars, and for participation in a
postwar international organization.
His political campaign has been negative, an attack on sup
posed Roosevelt inefficiency, yet he has promised nothing posi
tive —he has proposed no measures which can compare with the
benefits the people of the United States have gained from New
Deal legislation, or measures that can compare with the stature
the United States has achieved in international relations through
New Deal legislation and New Deal administration.
In short, the Republican candidate has merely offered to re
place the Roosevelt personality and party with the Dewey per
sonality and party. In 1944 this is not enough.
