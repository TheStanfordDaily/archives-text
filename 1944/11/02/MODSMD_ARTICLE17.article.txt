# BULL SESSION
## 
### Dick Crane 
Have you ever taken a course in
economics here at Stanford? If you
haven't, 1 would very much like to
enlighten you as to the general idea
of the courses. Even if you have
taken the aforementioned subjects,
you might find today's session some
what interesting and amusing, so
before you light a fire with today's
paper to keep warm in your "eight
o'clock," I suggest you peruse this
daily column.
We could pick one certain course
in this field, but in order that too
much abuse and ridicule is not
heaped upon a certain professor or
individual, I shall point out an im
iginary subject. They are all about
the same anyway.
Put On Your Assumption Cap
To get on with the story, we shall
"assume" the class is at eight o'clock,
ii tl also "assume'' that the prof is
>;i rime. This is rather a far-fetched
issumption. Then of course, there
ias to be an assumption that all the
-iudents who are enrolled in the
.mrso are in attendance, which is
mtastic. but for the sake of the
,-tory. we again have to "assume" it.
Nov, that wo hinc everything in

order, let's look toward the front
of the room, and what do we find?
Yes, it's true, the professor is blithe
ly skipping up and down the black
board, taking his glasses ofT, on, off,
on, off, on. there is more to this, but
not enough room to write about it.
Ah yes! also there is his assistant,
who is carrying his inevitable piece
of chalk, and he is drawing— not
nudes—but supply and demand
curves on the board.
Ami How's tlu* Pure-perfect?
The prof, starts to lecture, which
is the signal for everyone to "doze,"
and the class begins. He says, "In
the short run. long run, pure-perfect,
monopolistic, supply and demand
curve." This type of curve is for the
more advanced students of econom
ics—the supply of "Acme" far ex
ceeds the demand for '"White Horse."
The class immediately awakens, but
they ai e fooled, as the professor goes
back into economic theory, and the
lecture drones on, with no more of
the college students vocabulary men
tioned.
At quarter to the hour, the class is
so interested, that they star? to leave,
and the prof, sensing this, is as glad

to leave as the pupils, and calls the
class to a halt.
The hour ends with an announce
ment by the prof, that class will not
meet for the next three days, as he
will be selling pencils on thp corner
of University and Ramona. The
moral of the story is that economic
theory is wonderful, but it doesn't
Work.

much abuse and ridicule is not
heaped upon a certain professor or
individual, I shall point out an im
iginary subject. They are all about
the same anyway.
Put On Your Assumption Cap
To get on with the story, we shall
"assume" the class is at eight o'clock,
ii tl also "assume'' that the prof is
>;i rime. This is rather a far-fetched
issumption. Then of course, there
ias to be an assumption that all the
-iudents who are enrolled in the
.mrso are in attendance, which is
mtastic. but for the sake of the
,-tory. we again have to "assume" it.
Nov, that wo hinc everything in

order, let's look toward the front
of the room, and what do we find?
Yes, it's true, the professor is blithe
ly skipping up and down the black
board, taking his glasses ofT, on, off,
on, off, on. there is more to this, but
not enough room to write about it.
Ah yes! also there is his assistant,
who is carrying his inevitable piece
of chalk, and he is drawing— not
nudes—but supply and demand
curves on the board.
Ami How's tlu* Pure-perfect?
The prof, starts to lecture, which
is the signal for everyone to "doze,"
and the class begins. He says, "In
the short run. long run, pure-perfect,
monopolistic, supply and demand
curve." This type of curve is for the
more advanced students of econom
ics—the supply of "Acme" far ex
ceeds the demand for '"White Horse."
The class immediately awakens, but
they ai e fooled, as the professor goes
back into economic theory, and the
lecture drones on, with no more of
the college students vocabulary men
tioned.
At quarter to the hour, the class is
so interested, that they star? to leave,
and the prof, sensing this, is as glad

to leave as the pupils, and calls the
class to a halt.
The hour ends with an announce
ment by the prof, that class will not
meet for the next three days, as he
will be selling pencils on thp corner
of University and Ramona. The
moral of the story is that economic
theory is wonderful, but it doesn't
Work.
Have you ever taken a course in
economics here at Stanford? If you
haven't, 1 would very much like to
enlighten you as to the general idea
of the courses. Even if you have
taken the aforementioned subjects,
you might find today's session some
what interesting and amusing, so
before you light a fire with today's
paper to keep warm in your "eight
o'clock," I suggest you peruse this
daily column.
We could pick one certain course
in this field, but in order that too
much abuse and ridicule is not
heaped upon a certain professor or
individual, I shall point out an im
iginary subject. They are all about
