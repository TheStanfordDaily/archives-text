This column is today based on
three things. One is the recall to
this country of General Stilwell,
about which there has been con
siderable comment. The second and
third are more or less buried but
perhaps equally important bulletins
that British lorces have replaced ours
in Burma, and, from the Japanese
radio last Sunday, that English am
phibious units had landed in the
Nicobar islands.
The whole picture that is sudden
ly brought into sharp focus is that
of the Southeast Asia Theater, a
scene of coming battles and of both
post-war and prewar power politics.
The Geography
The geography of the area is not
difficult to comprehend. Consider
the continent of Asia to be a clenched
fist except tor the second and third
fingers, which are still straight and
pointing out from the hand. The third
finger is India, which is of course
solidly in our hands. The second,
not so firmly in the Japanese grip,
consists of the states of Burma on
the northeast, Siam on the south,
and French Indo China on the north
east. The narrow projection of the
Malay Peninsula juts out from the
southeastern part of the tip, and,
separated from its end, is the cartog
rapher's dot of Singapore.
The shipping lanes to the finger
are greatly imported by the Japa
nese navy's recent demise, and for
this reason enemy reports that Ad
miral Mountbatten is trying to get a
naval battle iy the Bay of Bengal
are completely logical. A landing in
the Nicobar islands would be a move
in this direction because they con
trol part of the sea-approaches to
the Japanese-controlled finger.
The sea-routes are controlled by
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
on the East, and the large island of
Haiwan, not to be confused with
Taiwan, or Formosa, on the West.
The Andaman islands would make a
good base for reconquest of Burma
by sea, while the Nicobars point to
the Malay states. If the reported
operations of Admiral Mountbatten
in this area are true, it shows he is
heading for the latter.
Control of China Sea Lanes
Haiwan, very near the China coast,
controls the sea-lanes between Hong
Kong and Singapore as well as ship
ping to the ports of French Indo-
China.
As for General Stilwell, it is re
marked that the rift between him
and General Chiang Kai-Shek is due
to the latter's policy of conserving
his resources for a post-war Civil
War with the Communists.
This, of course, doesn't increase
our respect for him, but he can't be
blamed for it, since it might well be
come a war for survival on his part.
Yet it is to his interests to gain as
much aid as possible, and despite
the fact that our obvious foreign
policy should be for him against the
Communists no matter what we
think of the respective parties, con
sidering too much Russian power in
Asia, it seems to the observer that
we should have put more pressure
on him. But it is highly possible
that it was. as President Roosevelt
said, simply a rift of personalities.

of the Southeast Asia Theater, a
scene of coming battles and of both
post-war and prewar power politics.
The Geography
The geography of the area is not
difficult to comprehend. Consider
the continent of Asia to be a clenched
fist except tor the second and third
fingers, which are still straight and
pointing out from the hand. The third
finger is India, which is of course
solidly in our hands. The second,
not so firmly in the Japanese grip,
consists of the states of Burma on
the northeast, Siam on the south,
and French Indo China on the north
east. The narrow projection of the
Malay Peninsula juts out from the
southeastern part of the tip, and,
separated from its end, is the cartog
rapher's dot of Singapore.
The shipping lanes to the finger
are greatly imported by the Japa
nese navy's recent demise, and for
this reason enemy reports that Ad
miral Mountbatten is trying to get a
naval battle iy the Bay of Bengal
are completely logical. A landing in
the Nicobar islands would be a move
in this direction because they con
trol part of the sea-approaches to
the Japanese-controlled finger.
The sea-routes are controlled by
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
on the East, and the large island of
Haiwan, not to be confused with
Taiwan, or Formosa, on the West.
The Andaman islands would make a
good base for reconquest of Burma
by sea, while the Nicobars point to
the Malay states. If the reported
operations of Admiral Mountbatten
in this area are true, it shows he is
heading for the latter.
Control of China Sea Lanes
Haiwan, very near the China coast,
controls the sea-lanes between Hong
Kong and Singapore as well as ship
ping to the ports of French Indo-
China.
As for General Stilwell, it is re
marked that the rift between him
and General Chiang Kai-Shek is due
to the latter's policy of conserving
his resources for a post-war Civil
War with the Communists.
This, of course, doesn't increase
our respect for him, but he can't be
blamed for it, since it might well be
come a war for survival on his part.
Yet it is to his interests to gain as
much aid as possible, and despite
the fact that our obvious foreign
policy should be for him against the
Communists no matter what we
think of the respective parties, con
sidering too much Russian power in
Asia, it seems to the observer that
we should have put more pressure
on him. But it is highly possible
that it was. as President Roosevelt
said, simply a rift of personalities.

This column is today based on
three things. One is the recall to
this country of General Stilwell,
about which there has been con
siderable comment. The second and
third are more or less buried but
perhaps equally important bulletins
that British lorces have replaced ours
in Burma, and, from the Japanese
radio last Sunday, that English am
phibious units had landed in the
Nicobar islands.
The whole picture that is sudden
ly brought into sharp focus is that
of the Southeast Asia Theater, a
scene of coming battles and of both
post-war and prewar power politics.
