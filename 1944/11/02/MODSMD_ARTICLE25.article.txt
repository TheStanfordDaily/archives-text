# Sonny Fails In Slapstick

J LOVE A SOLDIER—Now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
Paulette Goddard and Sonny Tufts
team up in Paramount's "I Love a
soldier" for a comedy-romance with
a war-time San Francisco setting.
Barry Fitzgerald sparkles in his
small role as a Powell Street cable
car operator.
Tufts has just returned from 14
months overseas and meets Miss
Goddard, welder by day and heart
breaker by night. For the next 107
minutes they slap each other in the
face again and again and again with
the net result that the pair gets mar
ried just before the virile Corporal
Tufts leaves for unknown parts.
Most of the "comedy" in "I Love
a Soldier" is very forced with Sonny
Tufts yet to prove that he is a real
actor. Apart from the local color in
volved, "I Love a Soldier" has little
to recommend it except the endear
ing performance of Barry Fitzgerald.
Phil Baker stars in the second half
of the Varsity bill, "Take It or Leave
It." We'll leave it.
Editor Dave Davis in an editorial
Tuesday came out for Mr. Roose
velt, as you probably know. You'll
just have to pardon Dave, as he
?pent last week-end in L.A. and
mighty queer things can happen to
h person in that "city of sin."—Dick
