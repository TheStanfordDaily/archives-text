Tuesday night when all of Roble
was "spooking" at a party in the C
wing, trouble was brewing in the
"forest," Roble's bewooded bicycle
parking lot. Cyclists, rushing for
their bikes the next morning, were
greeted by a six or seven foot mass
of mangled steel and rubber—the re
mains of the "forest's" bikes piled
upon each other.
Discounting several twisted spokes
and sprained handle-bars, no casu
alties were reported.
