# Sunday Barbecue Pit Celebration To Feature Songs, Yellsâ€”Hot Dogs!
## 
### 
Site of the Sunday barbecue spon
sored by Cardinals will be the three
month-old barbecue pit by the
Boathouse. Officially opened sum
mer quarter at the August 25 bar
becue, the $1875 pit was constructed
to fulfill a need recognized by Ex
com in 1943.
Student body President Janet
McClanahan, during her adminis
tration in '43, engaged Edward
Jaehne, Standard Oil Company ex
ecutive, to design the pit. Jaehne's
services as architect were given free
to the University.
Second Use
Under Dick Driscoll modifications
of the original plans and suggestions
for changing the site and general
shape of the pit were submitted to
Jaehne. Completed in August 1944
by the George Wagner Co., the pit
has been used but once to dale.
Cardinals planned the barbecue in
order to give students who were not
here during the summer the oppor
tunity to see and use it.
Cardinals will be paying for the
pit over a period of years from prof
its derived from activities they have
sponsored.
Food For All
Martha Austin, Cardinals member
in charge of the affair, announced
that the menu, as given by the cam
pus living group, will include green
salad and baked beans. In addition,
weinies and rolls will be donated by
Cardinals, and ice-cold cokes will be
sold by Roble women for a dime
apiece.
Ric Supple, cheer leader, will lead
the group in cheers and songs as
partial preparation for rooting at the
Cal-U.S.C. game. At the close of the
barbecue, many of the students, it
is expected, will go to Shaughnessy's

Show at the Memorial Auditorium.
Food chairman for the affair is
Pat Whittemore, and Barbara Bon
ner will be in charge of clean-up
