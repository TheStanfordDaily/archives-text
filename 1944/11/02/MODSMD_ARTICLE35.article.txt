# Union Records Banish Gloom
## 
### MARY AL SMITH 
Are you the sullen soph or the
frantic frosh who is searching for a
restful atmosphere in which to curl
up or collapse?
Before taking your problem to Mr.
Anthony, why not visit rooms 14 and
15 in the Old Union. There you can
recline in a Chinese red couch, gaze
at restful chartreuse walls, and en
joy recordings of Verdi's Falstaff.
By now it should be clear that the
music listening room, which has been
revamped and redecorated, is re
open for business. If it is business
to bury your books in the Ches'.fr
field ahses which you shed in the 112
rhythm of Puccini, Massenet, and
Rossini.
In addition to the new albums al
ready mentioned, a six-volume set
of "Music by the Masters," Verdi's
"Othello," and "La Boheme" are a
few of the records recently donated
to the Listening Room. Money or
disc contributions will be greatly ap
preciated, according to Sylvia Davis,
chairman of the committee.
Present relaxing hours are from 3
to 5 each afternoon. "If some de
pendable students will offer their
services as attendants, and help se
lect new rccords, the room hours can
be extended," continued Miss Davis.
When you pay your visit to the
Music Listening Rooms do not be
alarmed by the presence of three
law students, permanent fixtures,
who average six cases an hour in
this congenial atmosphere. These
students recommend chapter eight
in "Cases on Contracts" by Patter
son and Goble to be read with a
Debussy accompaniment.
