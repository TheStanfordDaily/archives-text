# Bartley Crum, Willkie Adviser Talks For FDR
## 
### 
Bartley Crum, speaking at a politi
cal debate held Tuesday night by
the Palo Alto Citizens for Victory,
declared that our best chance for a
permanent peace lies in the over
whelming reelection of President
Roosevelt Nov. 7.
Mr. Crum, prominent California
independent Republican, was one of
Wendell Willkie's close advisers in
1940 and was a member of the Will
kie campaign train. His opponent,
upholding Dewey, was Madame
liarry Orlova, White Russian lec
turer sent by the Republican Club
in San Francisco.
Must Examine Record
"Who Should Guide Our Foreign
Policy, Roosevelt or Dewey?" was
the subject of the debate. In order
to answer this question, said Mr.
Crum, we must examine the rec
ords of the two men, their parties,
snd the men in control of those par
ties on the paramount issue of for
eign policy.
President Roosevelt, according to
Mr. Crum, has come out unequivo
cally for the full participation of the
U.S. in securing permanent peace.
His program includes the setting up
of the peace structure of the United
Nations during the war, and the en
dowment of our representative in
the postwar peace organization with
authority to act independently of the
Senate.
Dewey, on the other hand, has a
record of isolationism in the past, as
demonstrated by his opposition to
end-lease and the recognition of
Soviet Russia. The Republican plat
form, designed to please both isola
tionists and internationalists, aroused
Mr. Willkie's condemnation as likely
to lead to another war fought in vain.
Dewey's Advisers
Dewey's advisers, the men in con
trol of the Republican party, include
men who are potentially dangerous
to .our foreign policy. John Foster
~>ulles, probable secretary of state in
a Dewey cabinet, has represented the
brutal Franco Fascist government of
Spain as an international lawyer, and
did the legal work in the incorpora
tion of the America First Committee.
Dewey has not repudiated the sup
port of Hearst-McCormick news
papers, nor of other isolationists.
Even if we assume that Dewey is
an internationalist, said Mr. Crum,
it is.hard to believe that he could
change the minds of such isolation
ists as Senators Johnson, Taft, Van
denberg, and Nye, who will head
vital senate committees in the event
of a Republican victory.
F.D.R.'s Rcclcction Predicted
"As a result of the Republican
party's failure to meet the foreign
policy issue in this campaign," Mr.
Crum said, "I predict their defeat
and the reelection of President
Roosevelt by an overwhelming ma
jority."
It was unfortunate that the Re
publicans did not .send a more effec
tive representative of their views on
foreign policy to the debate. Madame
Orlova's speech was a wierd mixture
of metaphysics, autobiography, and
dramatics.

tive representative of their views on
foreign policy to the debate. Madame
Orlova's speech was a wierd mixture
of metaphysics, autobiography, and
dramatics.
Bartley Crum, speaking at a politi
cal debate held Tuesday night by
the Palo Alto Citizens for Victory,
declared that our best chance for a
permanent peace lies in the over
whelming reelection of President
Roosevelt Nov. 7.
Mr. Crum, prominent California
independent Republican, was one of
Wendell Willkie's close advisers in
1940 and was a member of the Will
kie campaign train. His opponent,
upholding Dewey, was Madame
liarry Orlova, White Russian lec
turer sent by the Republican Club
in San Francisco.
Must Examine Record
"Who Should Guide Our Foreign
Policy, Roosevelt or Dewey?" was
the subject of the debate. In order
to answer this question, said Mr.
Crum, we must examine the rec
ords of the two men, their parties,
snd the men in control of those par
ties on the paramount issue of for
eign policy.
President Roosevelt, according to
Mr. Crum, has come out unequivo
cally for the full participation of the
U.S. in securing permanent peace.
His program includes the setting up
of the peace structure of the United
Nations during the war, and the en
dowment of our representative in
the postwar peace organization with
authority to act independently of the
Senate.
Dewey, on the other hand, has a
record of isolationism in the past, as
demonstrated by his opposition to
end-lease and the recognition of
Soviet Russia. The Republican plat
form, designed to please both isola
tionists and internationalists, aroused
Mr. Willkie's condemnation as likely
to lead to another war fought in vain.
Dewey's Advisers
Dewey's advisers, the men in con
trol of the Republican party, include
men who are potentially dangerous
to .our foreign policy. John Foster
~>ulles, probable secretary of state in
a Dewey cabinet, has represented the
brutal Franco Fascist government of
Spain as an international lawyer, and
did the legal work in the incorpora
tion of the America First Committee.
Dewey has not repudiated the sup
port of Hearst-McCormick news
papers, nor of other isolationists.
Even if we assume that Dewey is
an internationalist, said Mr. Crum,
it is.hard to believe that he could
change the minds of such isolation
ists as Senators Johnson, Taft, Van
denberg, and Nye, who will head
vital senate committees in the event
of a Republican victory.
F.D.R.'s Rcclcction Predicted
"As a result of the Republican
party's failure to meet the foreign
policy issue in this campaign," Mr.
Crum said, "I predict their defeat
and the reelection of President
Roosevelt by an overwhelming ma
jority."
It was unfortunate that the Re
publicans did not .send a more effec
tive representative of their views on
foreign policy to the debate. Madame
