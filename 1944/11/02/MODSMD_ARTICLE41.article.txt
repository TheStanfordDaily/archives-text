In a corner of the Dean of Women's
outer office there is a book shelf
with the inscription, Allene Thorpe

shelf are written by women or about
women and may be borrowed and
lead by anyone.
These books were bought with the

memory of Allene Thorpe, a former
Stanford student. Right now there
is a sum of about $35 that will be
used to buy more books.
