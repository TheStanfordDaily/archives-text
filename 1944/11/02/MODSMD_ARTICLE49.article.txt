# Lederer Talk Stresses 'No Such Thing as Style'
## 
### 
With a background of 25 years in the service of the theater, Mr. Francis
Lederer, now appearing in the James B. Cassidy production of Ibsen's
"A Doll s House,'' yesterday insisted to approximately 80 drama lovers
in the Little Theater that "There is no such thing as style, either in litera
ture, in music, or in play writing."
A belief in style of an individual, besides putting characters on a pedes-

tal when they were drawn from real'
life, also distorts the actor's ap
proach.
"These noted writers, Shake
speare included," continued Mr. Le
derer, "have written about actual
living people just as modern writers
do. It is for this reason that, we are
playing "A Doll's House" in the
spirit of Kaufman and Hart, whom
we consider observers of ev
eryday life and conversation."
Here Mr. Lederer emphasized that
the good play, adequate rehearsals,
and the proper manner do not make
the actor great. But rather, the pri
mary requisite of a leader in the
theatrical profession is a certain
magic of personality which emanates
from that individual who has the
courage to be himself at all times.
"If you follow your instinct blind
ly and discard your intellect (a
statement which excites consider
able audience comment and ques
tion) you cannot help expressing
yourself. An intellect is the worst

*
) handicap for an actor."
In advocating a movement on the
part of American youth for the or
ganizing of a National Theater,
which would be fully as important
to cultural United States as colleges,
Mr. Lederer said. "The share-crop
per of the South has a better chance
than the actor who doesn't have the
opportunity of exercising his pro
i fession."
