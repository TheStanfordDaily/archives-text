# Walker Tells Farm Plans For Postwar Buildings
## 
### JOKY NELL RYAN 
A Student Union large enough to
accommodate activities for all the
campus is embodied in the plans for
Stanford's postwar program, ac
cording to Frank Fish Walker, Fi
nancial Vice-President.
"I consider there is a definite need
for such a recreational center,"
commented Mr. Walker.
In his friendly, charming, and en
thusiastic way, Mr. Walker enumer
ated the extensive factors under
consideration for the Farm after the
war.
The Board of Trustees meeting on
Oct. 19, 1944, approved the authori
sation for a complete appraisal of
.ne postwar plan from the physical
standpoint by outside engineers.
This authorization was a revival
of a similar resolution made by the
Board in September of '41. Needless
to say the plan has been in the
drawer since Pearl Harbor.
Lighting, heating, and new furni
ture for all University buildings ai'e
included in the project.
Using a map of the campus, Mr.
Walker pointed out plans for a thor
oughfare which would provide an
other major turn-off from Palm
Drive comparable to Lomita Drive.
Galvez, the street between the
Hoover Library and Encina, would
be the second major road. It would
enable persons to go directly to
either end of the caftpus. Santa Te
resa, the street running in front of
the Fire House, would extend be
yond the Postoffi.ee and intersect
Galvez.
Branner will be reconverted to a
men's dormitory and with Encina
and Toyon will form a long men's
residence quadrangle. Mr. Walker
expressed sincere hopes that a rec
reational center for outside sports
will be provided in the small new
quad. Parking space and traffic
problems will also be considered.
As an Encina alumnus, the Finan
cial Vice-President seemed to take
gx-eat pleasure in discussing the
modernization of all Encina. The
project will include the complete re
â€¢'iring and redecorating of the tra
itional hall for freshman men, be
sides adding closets in the rooms.
He tentatively spoke of the possi
bility of building another wing on
Encina which would contain both
doubles and singles.
Construction of a Science Area in
the locality of the Chemistry Build
ing may be a realization in the fu
ture.
The road up the Row is exceed
ingly narrow and definitely designed
to accommodate the traffic needs of
the college student of 1890. A new
and wider road but one which would
keep all the atmosphere might im
prove the passing of cars on the
Row.
"Lane W," the alley behind the
Row which has served for the past
50 years as merely a delivery road,
may develop into a main street lead
ing to the upper Row.
In addition to a new street Mr.
Walker also spoke of the decided
possibility of providing adequate
parking space at the rear of each
house on the Row.
A new press building which would
house the staffs of the Daily, the
"Quad." and the Chappie is "under
discussion."
