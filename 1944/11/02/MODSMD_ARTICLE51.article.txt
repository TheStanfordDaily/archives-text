# Toyon Votes For Dewey
## 
### LORRY I. LOKEY 
Toyon men upheld the Stanford
Republican tradition by voting
nearly 2 to 1 for Governor Thomas
E. Dewey in a hall poll held last
Sunday to determine the favored
presidential candidate. Of the 112
votes cast, 70 went to Dewey, .'l7 to
President Roosevelt, and 5 were un
decided.
Republican comment following the
voting centered on criticism for the
fourth term, the alleged Communis
tic element within the Democratic
party, the domestic policy, and ad
ministration "power politics."
The Red Menace
Several students preferred Gov
ernor Dewey because they felt that
the government would be in danger
of Communistic or Socialistic con
trol in the event of a Democratic
victory, and that they felt there was
no place for either in American life.
Another student cast his vote for
Dewey because of his opinion that
the House of Representatives will go
Republican, an event that might
cause friction in the nation's foreign
policy under a Democratic adminis
tration. Opposing this idea was the
feeling current with many men that
the Senate will have a Democratic
majority; the Senate must ratify any
commitments this country makes
with a foreign country.
The Republican viewpoint was
summarized in one young voter's
comment, "I would vote for Dewey
in order to get a precise, cool, and
efficient man to govern the destiny
of the United States."
Demos* Trump Card
On the Democratic side of the
ledger was the feeling that the Dem
ocratic foreign policy is superior to
the "one offered by the Republicans.
"President Roosevelt's experience
in diplomacy will be needed at the
peace table," commented one Demo
crat. The foreign policy opinion ex
tended even among the Republican
element when one of the latter party
was quoted as saying, "I don't like
Dewey's foreign policy. That's why
I don't believe in changing men."
Most Democrats felt that any poll
taken on campus would be unre
liable as an indication of national
sentiment concerning the election,
and that results would be interest
ing only in comparison with results
of the national election.
Isolationist Fears
That there is no clear-cut issue
between either party, and that nei
ther Republican nor Democratic
platforms fellow a definitely con
structive policy, was the opinion
among the five undecided voters.
One neutral student observed that
"Dewey was once an isolationist. He
may revert to this policy after the
war, thus hurting our chance for a
lasting peace. Roosevelt has been in
office too long; and since he now
has tremendous power in his hands,
he may be unwilling to relinquish it
after the war. Wendell Willkie
would have been mv choice."
