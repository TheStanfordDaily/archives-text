Leyte Island, where American
land and naval forces have hacked
out beachheads in a surprise move
to split Jap strength in the Philip
pines. lies about midway between
Luzon and Mindanao, the two larg
est islands of the archipelago. Rank
ing eighth in area among the 7,08.3
links of the Philippine chain, Leyte
is more than twice as big as the
state of Rhode Island, says the Na
tional Geographic Society.
Approached from the east through
the broad expanse of Leyte Gulf,
the island offers anchorages in the
several bays and coves that notch
the eastern shore line. Largest in
let of the gulf is San Pedro Bay, a
haven shaped by the cast coast of
Leyte and the southwest coast of
ihe neighboring island '>112 Samar,
separated from Leyte by tho Strait
of San Juanico. Near the head of
the bay is Tacloban, Leyte's capital
and principal port. Seasonal winds
affect the safety of all teh harbors.
Rugged, Green, Hot
Besides Tacloban, now in Ameri
can hands, the chief towns on the
east coast, from south to north, are:
Hinunangan, at the mouth of the
Malaga River; Dulag, copra shipping
point; and Tanauan and Palo—the
latter about five miles south of the
capital.
Roughly an hourglass in outline,
Leyte is about 120 miles long. Its
waist is narrowed to 15 miles by
deep bites of Leyte Gulf and the
Camotes Sea. Mountains ridge the
interior, and rise to the 4,400-foot
peak of Mt. Lobi in the north. Some
mountains are extinct volcanoes.
Forests cover the mountain slopes.
Numerous streams furrow the
land. Largest rivers are in the north,
among them the Marabang, the Spa
niton, and the Naga. Watercourses
have served more for irrigation than
for transportation.
Typhoons occasionally sweep over
the island, doing much damage.
Leyte's climate is hot, but healthful.
Leyte Grows Cotton
One of the best cultivated of the
Philippines, Leyte grew cotton and
corn, tended coconut plantations for
oil and copra, and looked to its ex
tensive abaca areas tor the valuable
fibers to be made into ropes and
cables. Sugar and coffee were also
important yields, and rice was grown
for home use. From the forests came
dammar, the "brea" or "pitch" of
the Spaniards. Small ships were
built at Tacloban.
Mineral wealth included gold, sil

ver, lead, iron, and sulphur. Sul
phur from Leyte's mines supplied
Manila's powder works when the
city was under Spanish rule.
Roads parallel the central and
northern sections of the east coast,
and connect with cross-island and
west coast arteries. Feeders branch
from the coastal highway in the
north nto the interior.
Civil government was established
on Leyte after the Spanish-Ameri
can War. Native flare-ups occurred
in 1905 and 1906. Prewar population
was about 358,000.
Samar, where new American land
ings in the Philippines followed
successful campaigns on next-door
Leyte, is the easternmost of the main
central island group. On the north,
looking toward Manila, it is sepa
rated from Luzon Island by the less
than 11-mile-wide Sstralt of San
Bernardino.
San Juanico Strait, which the
Americans crossed from northeast
Leyte to southwest Samar, is at
points only 200 yards wide. Its aver
age width is slightly more than one
fourth to one-half of a mile. The
length of the strait is about 14 miles,
its passage obstructed by many islets
and shallows.
