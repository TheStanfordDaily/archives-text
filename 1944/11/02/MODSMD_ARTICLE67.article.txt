# Physical Therapy Scholarships Open
## 
### 
Scholarships are now available
for undergraduate and graduate stu
dents interested in physical therapy
as a profession, through the Na
tional Foundation for Infantile Pa
ralysis.
Third quarter juniors, seniors and
graduate students may apply for
scholarships covering tuition and
maintenance for the course in phys
ical therapy at Stanford,
The National Foundation for In
fantile Paralysis is making this pos
sible because of the acute shortage
of physical therapists needed for the
treatment of infantile paralysis. Po
sitions are now open in hospitals,
clinics, crippled children's schools
and state departments of health.
If you are interested, see Miss
Daniels, Room 4, Women's Gym.
