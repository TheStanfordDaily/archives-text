Chairs and couches are grouped to
gether and are regularly occupied
by students. There is a conspicuous

"Dewey is an isolationist and a re

a wonderful voice."
Says another voice, "I don't want
either one; I Want the Old Boy."
They are the political armchair
strategists, the Stanford version of
the corner store intellectuals. Yes,
