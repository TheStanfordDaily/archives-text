# STRAW IN THE WIND

Well, the Stanford election is over and no one is particularly
surprised at the results. As Dwight said in 1940, after the vote
tor Willkie, "Before Stanford stopped along the Quad to mark
an 'X' after its favorite candidate's name, the results were pretty
certain."
The voting followed the pattern set by the straw vote of
1940, although Governor Dewey received a support of only 2 to 1,
while Wendell Willkie was backed 3 to 1 by Stanford voters.
More undergraduate students followed the Republican line,
but graduate supporters of Roosevelt won the mock election
53 to 39.
The important factor in this election, as opposed to the mock
vote of 1940, was the spirit with which Stanford students ap
proached their own political campaign.
A graduate of Stanford, now in the service, who participated
in the 1940 campus vote, keynoted 1944 Stanford politics when
he said at the close of Thursday night's discussion that the ap
proach was "more serious," more sincere and less collegiate
than it had been in 1940.
Speaking for the men in service, "the men's minds are oc
cupied with many things, and the least of these is politics. But
they are interested and they are counting on you to look after
politics while they are away. After seeing the demonstration
here tonight I am sure Stanford is doing just that."
No matter how you voted, your interest, your conduct, earned
a salute—and you got it.
