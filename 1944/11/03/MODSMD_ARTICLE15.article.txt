# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It has come to our attention, as it undoubtedly has to others
using the books from the Reserve Book Room, that for those
having eight and nine o'clock classes, it is impossible to return
books before the nine o'clock deadline. For instance, students
who have an eight o'clock gym class and a nine o'clock chem
istry class cannot return their books on time and still get to their
class.
A solution to this problem could be found by making a return
slot similar to the one at the Civ. Libe.
Although we all appreciate the use of the library, some people
dislike paying 25 cents every day.
Sincerely, Kathie Tiernan Virginia Walker
