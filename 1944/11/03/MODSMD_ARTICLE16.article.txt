### Dick Crane 
The belF clangs madly, and Strauss
comes out of his corner swinging.
The lights blink off and on, and
people scurry helter-skelter for the
windows and doorways. Charlie, the
bus-boy, breaks out the huge rope,
and then starts putting the chairs on
the tables, taking no notice, of
course, whether there are people in
them or not.
All this, dear readers, is the Cel
lar's gentle way of reminding you
that the place is closing down. As a
matter of fact, the medical depart
ment has announced six cases of
war neurosis since the new regime
has been in effect.
This way of doing things, in my
ipinion, is very juvenile, and makes
he average student feel as if he
vveie in grade school again. The
Cellar" is a Stanford organization,
md operates purely for the students.
The students are aware of this, and
t the people running the "Celllar"
v 111 take a bit of good advice, I
<vish to let them know that we don't
i*e their methods one damn bit.
It's bad enough that our digestive
•y stems are in complete chaos from
.ho coffee, without wrecking our
tervous systems also. One more
hing while I am on the subject of i
he "Cellar": it all you people who!
,• oi k in that "den of iniquity" wou'd

break out in a smile once in a while,
or give a cheery good morning, peo
ple wouldn't think you were "soft"—
I honestly believe this.
The social season moves into full
swing this week-end, with three
very nice dances being given on this
fair campus, come this Saturday
evening.
The Monroe "Boozers'" annual
brawl promises to be "tops" in this
columnist's opinion, with a huge
laUgh for anyone who attends. The
main attraction is, of course, Joe
Sher and his Jriew haircut. I wonder
how much he charges to haunt a
| house!
If your insurance is paid up, it
certainly will be worth the chance
j of entering Sequoia Hall to attend
their "Rough and Smooth" Saturday
night dance. The dance chairman
says."I don't know about the
"smooth" part, but you can rest as
sured that the dance will be "rough"!
The boys from "Wushina;ton" Hall
are capitalizing on politics by mak
ing the coming election the theme of
their Saturday night affair. The
house is filled with mad geniuses,
so you can be sure that the evening
will not be borine.
