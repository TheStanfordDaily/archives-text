Amid fir trees (borrowed from the j
Corp Yard), piles of (I am going to
fool you) snow and all the other ;
trappings that go to make up winter
time, including pneumonia germs !
and the age old cure for coJ,ds. the
Monroe Ale and (oops the censor) j
- bridge club will tomorrow nite pre- I
sent Wintertime dance which, ac- j
cording to the advance reports, '
. promises to be one of the greatest of j
all time.
We bring you a quotation from
j Stan Day, Monroe president, which j
* j gives us some idea of the potentiality
of the affair. "This dance will posi
tively be a dance." And with this
momentous and timely statement we
took our leave of the esteemed Mr.
i Day.
This dance has been planned in j
the usual Monroe style—of course
everyone knows what that is—a min
imum of lights and a maximum of J
sofas.
Prominent members of the student
body plan to attend, but since there '
! are too many to mention in limited
i space we can only say that everyone
I who is anybody, and plenty who are
I not but think they are will attend;
j however we can say, and this is a
j scoop, that the (isn't the suspense
' terrific?) PHANTOM will attend.
The entertainment will begin at i
1 twelve o'clock (just time for a
j quicky) and a tremendous program
' has been worked out. The Monroe
j men are the perfect hosts, and their j
j parties leave pleasant memories and
; terrific hangovers.
Halloween was here (and how)
I and left behind it pleasant memories,
to say nothing of bruises, hangovers,
1 flattened furniture and tattered tem
' pers.
Many gentle little pranks, in the
! usual Stanford fun loving spirit, were j
played upon other groups, which
were killing in their enthusiasm and
I don't believe that it wasn't close, for
| when I say killing that is no flight of
the imagination, for it was close.
The ghosts, witches (and there
; were plenty on campus) were out en
| masse, and having a wonderful time,
j It is the fervent prayer of all that
j Halloween comes but once a year. '<
j for more than that would be too ;
1 much of a strain.
It is now time for the item that all !
J our avid readers (dear Mother, al
ways so loyal) have been waiting !
for the poke of the week. When you !
read this, either groan (I know you
! will) laugh, or cry but please don't i
■ sit in utter silence and then turn to
; your neighbor who is probably read
j ing it ,daily circulation of two) and
i say, this is so old. that guy should
i be more respectful of old age.

With the campus agog on the eve
of another election, Stanford stu

, tion and the various candidates (their
I fathers told them, and so it must

ligently and diplomatically discuss

As yet the rest home and the hos

not apply, but in order to handle the
