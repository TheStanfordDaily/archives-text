## 
### 
In an effort to clarify the position
of War Board in Stanford life Jean
nette Grimsley, SWB coordinator,
declared yesterday that War Board
belongs to the students; that the
board itself is only a mechanism that
would fail completely without the
backing, of every man and women
in the University.
"The War Board was not set up as
a separate activity or committee."
Miss Grimsley asserted. '"Our work
is only as important as each student
makes it by his co-operation and
realization of our aims."
Organized in *42
War Board was first organized as
a standard committee of Excom in
February of 1942. Bob Collins ol

fort under War Board s direction.
Editor of the Daily Hal Shafer re
ceived a congratulatory wire on that
issue from Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Morgenthau, Jr. The report of

Hal Shafer's death in action came to
the Daily last April.

were to save tires and gasoline (!).

was also instituted to aid Stanford
men in the service to complete their
education after the war. The fund

function of the War Board, Betty
Mae Hale, coordinator for Autumn
Quarter of 1943, stated that War

Stanford life and had come to take
a prominent place on the campus."
The War Board Coordinator, Miss
