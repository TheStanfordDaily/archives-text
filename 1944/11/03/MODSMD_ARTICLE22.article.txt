# Pianists Needed For Rehearsals
## 
### 
All rehearsals are now in progress
for Gaieties, the coming variety show
which is being produced this year
under the direction of Peggy Fitls.
However rehearsal pianists are still
urgently needed to work Monday
and Wednesday afternoons from 3 to
U, and every day from 5 to 6.
Ram's Head points are being given
for this work. Anyone interested
should contact Janice Shaughnessy
at 8619.
Copyists for the musical part of the
production are also badly needed.
Ten cents a sheet will be paid and
those interested may call Peggy Fitts,
22151.
