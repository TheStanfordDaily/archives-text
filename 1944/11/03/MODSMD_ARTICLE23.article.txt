# 'Irish Eyes' Given Boost
## 
### 
"IRISH EYES ARE SMILING"—now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
The old Twentieth Century-Fox
formula of girls plus music equals
money is put to work again in their
newest Technicolor musical, "Irish
Eyes Are Smiling." June Haver, tht
girl with the marshmallow person
ality and hair to match, cops head
billing as both Betty Grable and
Alice Faye are away from Fox await
ing the stork.
The story of Ernest Ball, composer
of "Let the Rest of the World Gr,
By." and similar oldies, is purport
edly told in this nostalgic flashback
to the turn of the century. Dick
Haymes as song-writer Ball sings
well but has that cigar store Indian,
stiffness about him. The caustic
Monty Woolley drools forth pearls
of wisdom in Haymes' moments oi
trouble.
Nothing exciting about "Irish Eyes
Are Smiling," but it is a rather re
laxing 90 minutes. Picture's best shot
—Salvation Army band playing be«
fore a burlesque house.
