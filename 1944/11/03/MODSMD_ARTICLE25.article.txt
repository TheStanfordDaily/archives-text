# Bugge Reveals Policy On Postponed Games
## 
### 
Intramural football games which
were postponed because of the rain
on Tuesday will be played at the
end of the scheduled season, ac
cording to Coach Elwyn Bugge, in
tramural director.
All trams will continue to follow
the regular schedule of games on
Tuesdays and Thursdays until the
last games originally scheduled
have been played; then the post
poned games will be played off.
The same procedure will probably
apply if any more games have to
be canceled on the arranged dates.
