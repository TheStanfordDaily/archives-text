# Gerona, Kncina, Firehouse Squads Win In Opener
## 
### 
The intramural football league got
off to a delayed start yesterday as
sixteen promising teams battled on
the green turf of the four practice
fields. Emerging victorious from
their openers were the Arguello A.A.,
Tyler Hall, Gerona, and Firehouse
squads in League I; while the League
II winners were Arthur Hall, Med.
School 111, Co. C, and the Encina
Flyers.
Agruello A.A.'s mighty midgets,
although minus the services of end
Morley Thompson, repeated their
Tuesday victory over the Kappa Dee
Gee Hashers, by a decisive 26-7 mar
gin. The upperclassmen were unable
to cope with the speed and co-ordi
nation of Arguello's Bradshaw, Jen
nings, Rouillard, and Pickering, who
each crossed the Dee Gee goal for a
single touchdown.
Tyler Hall upset Washington in a
high-scoring encounter that saw
Dennis Fox running rampant over
the hapless engineers. Eagen and
Sloabe also contributed to the 25-0
score. By a similar scores, the Fire
house sextet overran Toyon North,
whose defense was shattered by the
smoke-eaters' attack.
In a clash that might well prove
decisive in the League I champion
ship race, Gerona outfought a strong
Med. School 111 group to a 25-19
decision, which featured Bob Forbes
packing the pill for two Gerona
tallies.
The League II games in which the
squads were more evenly matched,
are probably headed by the Sequoia-
Encina tilt, in which the Roughs
were nosed out by the flying sol
diers to the tunc of 14-13 (those con
versions seem to count). Another
heartbreaker was the Buchanan-Co.
C encounter; over a dozen Bearcats
were substituted against the husky
soldiers, who came through to a
13-7 victory.
Arthur Hall, sparked by Rust, Cox,
and Mahcr —steamrollered a hapless
Toyon South team, 18-7; the hard
est fought tussle of the afternoon

saw Med. School 111 fighting Med.
School I to a 14-14 stalemate.
Coaches Bugge and Mumby have
announced that the games postponed
last Tuesday because of the rain
would be played off after the regu
lar schedule is completed.

are probably headed by the Sequoia-
Encina tilt, in which the Roughs
were nosed out by the flying sol
diers to the tunc of 14-13 (those con
versions seem to count). Another
heartbreaker was the Buchanan-Co.
C encounter; over a dozen Bearcats
were substituted against the husky
soldiers, who came through to a
13-7 victory.
Arthur Hall, sparked by Rust, Cox,
and Mahcr —steamrollered a hapless
Toyon South team, 18-7; the hard
est fought tussle of the afternoon

saw Med. School 111 fighting Med.
School I to a 14-14 stalemate.
Coaches Bugge and Mumby have
announced that the games postponed
last Tuesday because of the rain
would be played off after the regu
lar schedule is completed.
The intramural football league got
off to a delayed start yesterday as
sixteen promising teams battled on
the green turf of the four practice
fields. Emerging victorious from
their openers were the Arguello A.A.,
Tyler Hall, Gerona, and Firehouse
squads in League I; while the League
II winners were Arthur Hall, Med.
School 111, Co. C, and the Encina
Flyers.
Agruello A.A.'s mighty midgets,
although minus the services of end
Morley Thompson, repeated their
Tuesday victory over the Kappa Dee
Gee Hashers, by a decisive 26-7 mar
gin. The upperclassmen were unable
to cope with the speed and co-ordi
nation of Arguello's Bradshaw, Jen
nings, Rouillard, and Pickering, who
each crossed the Dee Gee goal for a
single touchdown.
Tyler Hall upset Washington in a
high-scoring encounter that saw
Dennis Fox running rampant over
the hapless engineers. Eagen and
Sloabe also contributed to the 25-0
score. By a similar scores, the Fire
house sextet overran Toyon North,
whose defense was shattered by the
smoke-eaters' attack.
In a clash that might well prove
decisive in the League I champion
ship race, Gerona outfought a strong
Med. School 111 group to a 25-19
decision, which featured Bob Forbes
packing the pill for two Gerona
tallies.
The League II games in which the
squads were more evenly matched,
are probably headed by the Sequoia-
Encina tilt, in which the Roughs
were nosed out by the flying sol
diers to the tunc of 14-13 (those con
versions seem to count). Another
heartbreaker was the Buchanan-Co.
