# 'Why I Voted For---'
## ROOSEVELT 
### 
Esther Gray—I'm in favor of all
the social legislature he's put in; he's
abolished the sweatshops, furnished
workers with a bargaining power
with employers, established a floor
under wages and a ceiling over
hours, better housing, old age se
j curity, and unemployment insur
ance. I think he's more capable of
handling foreign relations and that
! he did everything he could to pre
pare us for war.
Pat De Long—I like Roosevelt's
i foreign policy, and I don't think
i Dewey's had enough experience for
| the job. Dewey has contested issues
which are much less important today
than those brought forward by Pres
ident Roosevelt.
Mary A1 Smith —After reading
Dave Davis' editorial yesterday
' morning, I'm giving Dewey back to
I the Republicans and am now con
( sidering a vote on a split ticket for
Davis and Hearst.
Barney Gugel—I didn't. I voted
| for the Old Boy because he is the
| candidate of Chaparral. The Fall
Chappie will appear next Friday at
the new low price of 25 cents, etc.,
! etc., ad infinitum.
| Jim Jackman —Roosevelt is more
qualified in foreign policy than
Dewey. This issue is the most im
portant issue of the election. I have
always supported the President's do
| mestic policies.
