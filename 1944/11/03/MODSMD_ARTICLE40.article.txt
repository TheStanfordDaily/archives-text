Dinner conversations were notice
ably subdued at Encina during the
past week, and the entire place in
some ways took on the general at
mosphere of a mortuary. The
"brains" (those that knew and knew
they knew) and the "hangers"
(those that knew not and knew
they km w not) presented a sharp
contrast. "Brains," happy and con
tent with their knowledge, sat slow
ly digesting their meals and philo
sophically debated the moral as- j
pects of the embryology lecture, |
while the "hangers" ate hurriedly t
and dived headlong into the books j
again trying to retrieve any bits of |
information they could from the elu- i
sive germ layers of their embryology |
book. In case you hadn't guessed, it i
was exam week. But by tonight we {
should all be thinking normally !
again ,normal thinking refers to 1
women, dances, politics, discharges, :
and money).

Many a G.I. turned up at the
Hallowe'en party in the Nitery Fri
day night to hear Professor Merrit
turn out his story. He did as i
well with the fabled "Monkey's |
Paw" as he did with Shakespeare's j
witches.

The dance at the Pavilion follow- i
ing the Nitery party was exception- j
ally well attended, so we pat our- i
selves on the back and exclaim, \
"They must like us." Or maybe it's
just Jackie Herr and the boys who
make the music.

Pre-meds are now sweating out
the interviews and assignments to
Medical School come December. For
those who are aching for a one-way i
trip east of the Mississippi, north of j
the Mason-Dixie line, this one gay j
thought: Til ere may be a med school
somewhere in Alaska yet.

A tender scene was witnessed the j
other day in chem lab. Some AST
gentleman, who shall be nameless, 1
had picked a wild flower and placed :
it in an Erlenmeyer Mask full of wa- !
ter above his work table. He would
glance up every once in a while for j
inspiration, and then return to his |
work. Our faith in humanity is re- |
vitalized; a flower can live amid the j
cruel facts of a chem lab.

Co. C's mailman, "Ham" Hamil- i
ton. took to the high road this week.
He had received a transfer to the
University of Pennsylvania where
he will start term five, pre-med.
This jaunt puts him within twelve
hours of home, and he was all smiles
as he left.

Army ... of MP's.
Noticed Jerry Goodhue's doctor
ish-looking mustache.
Closing thought—Some does it ev
ery week.
