### JOHN LARSON 
lectual publications (like
Lives") with my destination "The !
Sad Sack," a 115 cartoon biography
of this famed character. In brief, my
opinion of this intriguing two dollar
volume of Army humor is, "It sends I
me!"
Then there's Virgil Partch's "It's |

Man In the Shower; It's Hot In Here;
It's Smart To Be People; and Is It
Anyone We Know?
