## 
### 
On October !(, 1N!)o. a group of Stanford women met in Woodpecker
Hall—it was (hen the Women's Gym—to eleet the first officers of the W.A.A.
Since that day the existence of this organization has been uninterrupted,
making it one of the oldest continuous groups 011 the campus.
Credit for the inspiration which started the W.A.A. ball rolling is due

to a Stanford faculty member who, 4
when speaking to a group of Ruble
women, suggested the need of an
athletic organization to supplement
the work of the physical education
department.
The curriculum offered by the de
partment at this time was primarily
composed of formal gymnastics and,
therefore, the W.A.A. was organized
into individual after-school clubs
interested. When participation in ac
tivities in which the students were
interested. When participation in i
tivities — volleyball, tennis, basket--
ball, —indicated a general demand j
for them, they were taken over into j
the regular physical education pro- j
gram.
I'.E. Stuff
Originally the faculty both joined
in the activities and offered special
instruction to the students as well.
Harry Malone spent, many hours in
teaching fencing. Moreover, girls
especially proficient in any one sport
were paid to coach W.A.A. members
in its fundamentals.
There have been many changes
within the organization, however.
Formerly, students were required to
pay dues before they could partici

.
pate in the activities. Now, the
W.A.A. receives fifty cents for each
girl from the student body fund. At
one time the W.A.A. owned its own
boathouse on Lake Lagunita, at an
other it participated in intercolle
giate events.
W.A.A. Extended
Due to the war and the effort to
concentrate social life on campus,
the W.A.A. has extended its calei|
dar of activities, according to Mi*.
Pat Cashetl, co-director of the
W.A.A. As an example of this Miss
Cashell cited the fact that almost
forty teams are enrolled in the pres
ent volleyball intramura's.
The Stanford W.A.A. is a member
of the Athletic Federation for Col
lege Women.
