# Morgan Recalls Stanford Career And Campus Life
## 
### JOHN LARSON 
Well known on the campus for
his participation in theatrical per
formances is Dr. Bayard Quincy
Morgan, head of the Germanic Lan
guages department. As an amateur
actor. Dr. Morgan has taken part in
numerous Stanford productions, in
cluding the spring show of a few
years back, "How's Your Circula
tion?"
Dr. Morgan left the University of
Wisconsin in 1934 to become head of
the Germanic Languages department
at Stanford, succeeding the late W. A.
|)oper.
Language Valued
Dr. Morgan is a believer in the
study of foreign language for the
youth of any country. In his opinion,
the knowledge and study of the Ger
man language and the German
people, which became vitally impor
tant when we entered into war with
Germany, will continue to be of great
significance economically, politicallly,
and socially after the war.
"The German people will continue
to dominate western Europe, so it
not only be necessary to deal with
them, but to understand them," Dr.
Morgan stated. He added, "No true
understanding of foreign people can
be had except through their own
language.'' "That means," he said,
"that we must train a large number
of young Americans to read and
speak the German language as a
matter of self interest."
Varied Activities
The activities of the department
have been many, including publica
tions, a list of which would exceed
the space allowed to this article. In
the past, department activities in
cluded the German House, a resi
dence hall for women students in
terested in learning to speak Ger
man; performance of German plays
under direction of a staff member:
and a special Christmas party open
to all those interested.
Previous to his Stanford career,
*\ Morgan taught German at the
University of Wisconsin for 27 years.
Born in Dorchester, Massachusetts,
he later moved to Hartford, Connec
ticut and attended the public high
school and Trinity College there. In
1904 he received his A.B. degree and
became a member of Phi Betta
Kappa.
He then went to Germany and
studied at the University of Leipzig;
in 1C07 he received a Ph.D. degree
in German.
Stanford Family
Reviewing his career on the Farm,
Dr. Morgan remarked that he con
sidered nothing more outstanding
than the peculiar atmosphere which
characterizes the relationship be
tween the students and faculty. "The
University forms a small community;
everyone you see is engaged in the
same education adventure," he said.
"Most barriers between students and
teachers found in other colleges (tf
comparable rank do not exist here,"
he said.
In his ten years at Stanford, he
was particularly impressed by the
tremendous significance of the honor
code for the preservation of the stu
dent-faculty relationship. "Leaving
a state university where dishonesty
in academic work was a perennial
scandal, to come to Stanford where
cheating on exams constitutes no real
blem, was like emerging from a
dark cellar into the brightest sun
light," Dr. Morgan stated.

Previous to his Stanford career,
*\ Morgan taught German at the
University of Wisconsin for 27 years.
Born in Dorchester, Massachusetts,
he later moved to Hartford, Connec
ticut and attended the public high
school and Trinity College there. In

He then went to Germany and
studied at the University of Leipzig;
in 1C07 he received a Ph.D. degree

Stanford Family
Reviewing his career on the Farm,
Dr. Morgan remarked that he con
sidered nothing more outstanding
than the peculiar atmosphere which
characterizes the relationship be
tween the students and faculty. "The
University forms a small community;
everyone you see is engaged in the
same education adventure," he said.
"Most barriers between students and
teachers found in other colleges (tf
comparable rank do not exist here,"
he said.
In his ten years at Stanford, he
was particularly impressed by the
tremendous significance of the honor
code for the preservation of the stu
dent-faculty relationship. "Leaving
a state university where dishonesty
in academic work was a perennial
scandal, to come to Stanford where
cheating on exams constitutes no real
blem, was like emerging from a
dark cellar into the brightest sun
light," Dr. Morgan stated.
Well known on the campus for
his participation in theatrical per
formances is Dr. Bayard Quincy
Morgan, head of the Germanic Lan
guages department. As an amateur
actor. Dr. Morgan has taken part in
numerous Stanford productions, in
cluding the spring show of a few
years back, "How's Your Circula
tion?"
Dr. Morgan left the University of
Wisconsin in 1934 to become head of
the Germanic Languages department
at Stanford, succeeding the late W. A.
|)oper.
Language Valued
Dr. Morgan is a believer in the
study of foreign language for the
youth of any country. In his opinion,
the knowledge and study of the Ger
man language and the German
people, which became vitally impor
tant when we entered into war with
Germany, will continue to be of great
significance economically, politicallly,
and socially after the war.
"The German people will continue
to dominate western Europe, so it
not only be necessary to deal with
them, but to understand them," Dr.
Morgan stated. He added, "No true
understanding of foreign people can
be had except through their own
language.'' "That means," he said,
"that we must train a large number
of young Americans to read and
speak the German language as a
matter of self interest."
