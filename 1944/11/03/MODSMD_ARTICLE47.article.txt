# WAR FRONTS

### Elliot Epsteen 
While the political maneuvers in
Chungking continue, so, unfortu
nately, does the Japanese drive in
tended to connect Manchuria and
Singapore by means of an overland
route.
The Japanese have finally pushed
into the suburbs of Kweilin, and here
they seem to be making progress.
However, in considering cities such
as this built to resist ancient sieges,
the main defense can be expected to
be made in the older, stone-con
structed houses of the main part of
the place rather than the more light
ly put-together buildings on the out
skirts which are more shell-traps
than anything else. In the wars of
a century ago, a commander detailed
to hold a city would usually fire the
suburbs.
Jap Maneuvers
What seems to have happened can
be in some part gleaned by examin
ing previous news from this area.
The Chinese forces, faced with a
mounting drive against their front
and rear, seem to have abandoned
the Hankow-Canton railway and
made an oblique retreat into Kwang
si province, to the east, and here es
tablished a strategic pivot at Kweilin.
The enemy followed this retrograde
movement, both because it might de
velop into a threat to his communica
tions, and because of the strategic
value of this province previously dis
cussed in past articles of this series.
Kweilin is difficult to take be
cause, as was said previously, it is at
the narrow end of a cone-shaped
pass. The enemy therefore decided to
turn the city from the west and either
pen its garrison up inside of it or

else lever that garrison out. But, in
order to outflank a position, an at
tacker shows his own flank, and the
Chinese took advantage of this fact
to cut off part of the column en
gaged in this maneuver, by striking
west from Kweilin.
Frontal Attack
The encircling thrust on the part
of the enemy might have been either
a feint to cover the concentration
of forces for a frontal assault through
the pass, or else their main effort.
If the latter was true, then the Chi
nese seem to have shifted too much
of their weight to meet it, and the
frontal plunge was thus facilitated.
It was made, and it is now in the
outskirts of the threatened city.
Now the Chinese seem to have
shifted forces back to Kweilin and
this has helped matters there some
what, but the Japanese turning col
umn has managed to extricate itself
from its difficulties and is moving
again. The Chinese have interior
lines, but horribly inferior forces,
it seems, and their movements are
hampered by a river running be
hind Kweilin, the chief defect in
their position here.
Politics,
The request by the Chinese Gen
eralissimo for the return of Donald
Nelson seems to contradict rumors
of an extreme crisis. However, it
seems that Chungking wants our in
tervention there to be strictly on an
economic basis. Chiang retaining the
full prestige of his title of "General
issimo of the Armed Forces and
Super Dictator of all China."
