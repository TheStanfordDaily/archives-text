### 
Gloria Cassidy—l feel that any
man who holds the presidential of
fice for 1G years gains so great a
control over the offices of the gov
ernment that American democracy
is threatened. On the other hand, I
believe that Dewey has proved him
self an able, conscientious, and in
telligent leader.
I.agunita resident assistant—l'm
a Democrat for Dewey. Although
I think both candidates are capable,
I fear the possibility that Senatoi*
Truman might have to take over the
Presidency.
John Larson—l'm for him because
of his record as a progressive, sin
cere, duty bound, competent admin
istrator; and I believe that Dewey,
if elected, will clean out the graft
and wasteful spending of the present
administration and would obtain a
more just peace for our nation be
cause of his experience in business
and politics.
John Simon—President Roosevelt
has been in office too long. We
should have a Republican president
to complement our Republican Con
gress. The New Deal has failed and
we need someone who can carry on
a sensible program instead of crack
pot schemes.
Audry Freese—Dewey is a better
man. His foreign policy would be
better and there would be less poli
tics and bureaucracy in government.
The public would be better informed
about government affairs.
