### BOB HUGHES 
Champagne, turhot, poulet en casserole with mushrooms, bacon and
kidneys, whiskey and soda, and a kippered herring are among tlit* present
troubles of Jack Sollers, whose duty it is to see that scenery and props
are ready to go this coming Wednesday evening when "The Dover Road"
begins a five day run at the Little Theater.
The play, written by A. A. Milne, calls for a superb dinner for three.

served by four servants, and a tre
mendous breakfast for bewhiskered
Leonard the following morning.
Certain gourmets, hard hit by ra
tioning, have considered it worth
while to attend the show merely in
order to see once more the excel
lence of the service provided for his
guests by eccentric Mr. Latimer.
The scene is laid in a wealthy Eng
lish home, surrounded by an aura of
mystery. An old German carved gilt
mirror with cupids has been resur
rected and restored by Mr. Sollers'
class, and a huge chandelier will
hang from the ceiling for this fan
tastic comedy written by the author
of "Winnie the Pooh."
Lace Negligee
Johnny High, cast as Mr. Latimer,
combines proper evening dress with
a wierd embroidered smoking jacket
lo prove his disregard of the custo
mary, while Sally Stocker, playing
Eustacia, first appears in a flowery
flowing black lace negligee.
Mrs. Muriel Lievsay, assisted by
Betty Bottenberger, is in charge of
costuming the production. The other
two male characters, played by New
ton Arnold and Harvey Small, are
tweedy British gentlemen.

Zebra Outfits
Although suave Dominic, the but
ler, played by Joaquin Aguirre, wears
customary cutaway garb, the foot
men and maids reflect the curious
tastes of their master, Mr. Latimer,
by making their strange entrances
and exits clothed in black and white
stripped uniforms.
Ann, played by Hazel Spore,
dresses quietly, conservatively, and
attractively in keeping with the role.
Stage crews for the production in
include Nydia Nydigger. Judy Shrae
der, Mary Lou Patten, Dick Wil
liams, and Janice Swan. Lighting is
being handled by Sally Stocker,
Corky Wollman, and Mary Higgins.
