This cartoon might be called "Li'l Injun Who Doesn't Know the
Hymn." It has been observed, at recent group singing, that there are
many Li'l Injuns who DON'T. Herewith are printed the words; learn
them for the barbecue Sunday evening!
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher.
Where at eve the coast range lies
In the sunset fire.
Flushing deep and paling.
Here we raise our voices hailing, thee our alma mater.
From the foothills to the bay it shall ring, as we sing.
It shall ring and lloat away.
Hail Stanford Hail!
Hail Stanford Hail!
