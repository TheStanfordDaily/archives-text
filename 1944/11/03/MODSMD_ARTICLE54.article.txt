# Vital Problems of Postwar Japan Discussed By Masland at 'Y' Group
## 
### 
Professor John W. Masland spoke (in "Post-War Japan" yesterday at
a meeting of the World Affairs V" group. Although only about 179 c of
the land area is arable, he said, the problem is not a question of acquir
ing more room for expansion of the population; but of regulating the

the utilization of resources and in
dustries to raise the country's stand
ard of living.
Concerning post-war treatment of
Japan, Professor Masland stated, the
preeminent theories are (1) complete
demobilization of Japan's armed
forces, (2) deprivation of all her in
dustry, reducing her to an agricul
tural nation. (3) elimination of cer
tain strategic industries such as air
craft, aluminum, and oil refining, and
(4) strict regulation by the United
Nations of these strategic industries.
Discussing the possibility of Japa
nese democratic government, he said
that free thinking among the people
has not been so absent as many sup
pose. It has existed in Japanese
schools, and not all civilians have
been in sympathy with the military
faction. Literacy ranks higher in
Japan than in almost any other na
tion of the world.
