# Sports Precede Barbecue Sunday
## 
### 
"Athletics before Dietetics" or
A.B.D. is the W.A.A. Board slogan
for the Cardinals Barbecue Sunday.
The slogan subtley invites all stu
dents to come to the W.A.A. Sport
Day at the Women's Gym from 2
to 4:00 p.m. before attending the
barbecue.
Living units are urged to challenge
other groups in some sport or other
for the occasion. Tennis, volleyball,
swimming, baseball, and dancing will
be featured. Already Roble 3C has
challenged the Roble Hashers to a
volley-ball game; 2B has challenged
Buchanan to a baseball game; and
Lagunita has challenged Branner to
a volley-ball game.
Sport Day will take place whether
it rains or not.
