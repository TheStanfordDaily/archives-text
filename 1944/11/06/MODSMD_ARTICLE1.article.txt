# Frosh Girls Plan Formal
## 
### MARION MORROW 
It's a moonlit night—the moon is
out. It's a starlit night—and the stars
are shining. It's a night for romance
—and Stanford discovered it first.
Picture the moon, the stars, a Stan
lord rough and coed dancing in the
dark. Then picture soft music, a
cosmopolitan atmosphere, pictur
esque surroundings. Concentrate on
what you've read about the gaiety
and mystery—of Paris; the colorful
sidewalk cafes, the stirring melodies,
the Bohemian people.
Put all this together, then place
yourself in the middle. You look
around, to your right you see the Arc
de Triumphe, to your left you see the
Eiffle Tower, straight ahead you see
refreshments. You go straight ahead.
You return to the dancefloor of the
Branner-Roble-Ventura formal "La
Victoire Parisienne," where the
freshman women date you, Women's
Gym, Nov. 11, tickets $2, refresh
ments, Howard Frederic and his
Baud of Gold, et al., and you stop.
You are overcome. There's a tack
stuck in your shoe. You take out the
tack.
The music is wonderful. You re
member you read in the "Daily"
that Howard Frederic and his Band
of Gold is the best orchestra on the
Peninsula and you feel suddenly
friendly toward the "Daily." It's tips
are always right. (Take the dagger
away now, Dave).
You realize that "La Victoire
Parisienne" is the best formal you've
ever been to, and you're glad you
didn't forget to try on your formal
a week ahead of time so you could
lose that seven pounds gained from
eating too many boxes of "Oreos."
You are suddenly very happy.
Then the orchestra plays "Go on
Home." You've had a super-colos
sal time. Try it and see. Also let
me know how your blind-date turns
out.
