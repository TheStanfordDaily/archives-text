# Cal Debate Tonight 7:30
## 
### 
Stanford Republicans and Demo
crats alike will have one last chance
to sway the undecided vote tonight
when they meet for the Election Eve
Debate between Stanford and Cal in
the Education Audtorium at 7:45 p.m.
'â€¢This is your chance to convince
the "indecisive man" as to whether
or not there is an "indispensable
man," said debate manager Carol
Newton, in urging both Roosevelt
and Dewey supporters to come out
for the debate and the open forum
to follow.
Pickus, Small for Roosevelt
Donna Pickus and Marshall Small,
speaking in favor of Mr. Roosevelt,
will represent Stanford in the debate
with a Cal Republican team.
Miss Pickus participated in the
Election Rally held last Thursday
when she and J. D. Williams spoke
in favor of the Roosevelt-Truman
ticket, and Mr. Small represented
Stanford in several debates last sum
mer.
Bailey To Preside
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, history pro
fessor and author of the recently
published "Woodrow Wilson and the
Peace," will preside as chairman of
the debate and the discussion to fol
low.
Tonight's debate is the second of
two campaign clashes planned with
Cal for the week, preceding Ihe na
tional election.
First Debate Thursday
The first was held last Thursday
when Carol Newton and Morley
Thompson wont to Berkeley to meet
a Cal Democrat team.
Although Stanford had the Repub
lican side in the debate at Berkeley
and the Cal team will have the Re
publican side in tonight's debate, the
question has been worded so that
the Stanford team will debate the
negative in both cases.
Tonight's question is, "Resolved,
that the Dewey-Bricker ticket should
be elected."
"The first campaign debate at Cal
created a great interest among the
student body, and because of the
timeliness of the question plus the
additional rivalry that always exists
between a Cal and Stanford team, we
expect tonight's debate to have a
record crowd," said Miss Newton.
