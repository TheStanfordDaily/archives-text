# THE 						NEW SOCIAL POLICY
## 
### 
Stanford students await eagerly the announcement of social j
policy for Autumn Quarter, 1944, to come from ExCom this
Wednesday night.
Quarter ' after guarter successive Ex Committees announce
social policies for the student body; this process has been known ,
as positive-value student government.
The effect of this process, and probably the value, has been j
negative. Perhaps a guarter free from "social policy" would be
such a relief that students would look after themselves.
