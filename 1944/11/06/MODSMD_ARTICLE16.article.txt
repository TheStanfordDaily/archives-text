# THANKS, IT WAS GRAND
## 
### 
Three men's living groups, one honorary organization, and
Shaughnessy worked hard to give the Farm a real, old-time
weekend, full of activity with a capital "A."
Thanks to Seguoia for a "Rough-Smooth Brawl," to Monroe
Hall for "Wintertime," and last, but not least, to Washington
for "Campaign Capers."
That sturdy organization, Cardinals, gave a swell feed Sunday,
and the Shaughnessy Shows, with solid adventure, wound up
the festivities.
