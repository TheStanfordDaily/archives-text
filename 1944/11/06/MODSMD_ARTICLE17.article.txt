In the autumn quarter here at Stanford, there is something
more prevalent than either women or bad marks, md is sci
entifically known as (ginnur eson), or to the layman, a common
"cold."
This disease can be picked up in a various number of v/ays,
one of the most common methods being to drink out of the same
beer bottle. Only upperclassmen get colds this way, because
for the first two years, your parents never know how much it
costs to go to school, and you don't have to split a beer. Fresh
men beware!
Another common way to pick one up is by osculation. This
is by far the most interesting way, but also very dangerous, as
the person you got the cold from undoubtedly got it from some
one else, and they got it from another person, who got it from
somebody, and the first thing you know, you are giving the
damn thing back to the person you got it from. All in all, it's a
very vicious cycle. Anyone who doesn't know what "oscula
tion" is, I suggest they have a long talk with their advisor about
the "birds and bees."
There is, of course, always a danger of catching a cold when
you walk in the rain without shoes, but I think that if most of
you would write to your parents, and let them know that shoes
are being worn this season at Stanford, I think they will kick
(pun) through with the necessary funds.
Now to talk about the symptoms. First, a headache—similar
to a "hangover." Then a stuffed head—this is hard to note for
some students—"watery eyes," back-ache, arthritis, neuralgia,
sinus, and for the more severe kind, a piece of lung accom
panied by each cough.
The first thing to do in curing this malady, is to go to the
"Cellar" store and get some Kleenex. This is easy to do, as you
only have to crawl around the floor three times on your hands
and knees, stand on your head, and bark twice, to get that
precious little gift from Mr. Gunther. After obtaining the Kleenex,
buy some Vapor-Rub, nose drops, cold tablets, aspirin, and then
throw the damn stuff away, and turn in to the Rest Home or slit
your throat. You're dead in either case, so your cold is cured.
It's all very simple if you know how.
A "Stubby" to Doug DuLac, who performed so brilliantly and
1 nusingly for the Stanford students at the Monroe "Brawl" on
ie campus over the weekend. His chatter and magic was the
\\t of the dance, and I wish to thank him on behalf of those who
.saw hiin perform.

damn thing back to the person you got it from. All in all, it's a
very vicious cycle. Anyone who doesn't know what "oscula
tion" is, I suggest they have a long talk with their advisor about
the "birds and bees."
There is, of course, always a danger of catching a cold when
you walk in the rain without shoes, but I think that if most of
you would write to your parents, and let them know that shoes
are being worn this season at Stanford, I think they will kick
(pun) through with the necessary funds.
Now to talk about the symptoms. First, a headache—similar
to a "hangover." Then a stuffed head—this is hard to note for
some students—"watery eyes," back-ache, arthritis, neuralgia,
sinus, and for the more severe kind, a piece of lung accom
panied by each cough.
The first thing to do in curing this malady, is to go to the
"Cellar" store and get some Kleenex. This is easy to do, as you
only have to crawl around the floor three times on your hands
and knees, stand on your head, and bark twice, to get that
precious little gift from Mr. Gunther. After obtaining the Kleenex,
buy some Vapor-Rub, nose drops, cold tablets, aspirin, and then
throw the damn stuff away, and turn in to the Rest Home or slit
your throat. You're dead in either case, so your cold is cured.
It's all very simple if you know how.
A "Stubby" to Doug DuLac, who performed so brilliantly and
1 nusingly for the Stanford students at the Monroe "Brawl" on
ie campus over the weekend. His chatter and magic was the
\\t of the dance, and I wish to thank him on behalf of those who
.saw hiin perform.
In the autumn quarter here at Stanford, there is something
more prevalent than either women or bad marks, md is sci
entifically known as (ginnur eson), or to the layman, a common
"cold."
This disease can be picked up in a various number of v/ays,
one of the most common methods being to drink out of the same
beer bottle. Only upperclassmen get colds this way, because
for the first two years, your parents never know how much it
costs to go to school, and you don't have to split a beer. Fresh
men beware!
Another common way to pick one up is by osculation. This
is by far the most interesting way, but also very dangerous, as
the person you got the cold from undoubtedly got it from some
one else, and they got it from another person, who got it from
somebody, and the first thing you know, you are giving the
damn thing back to the person you got it from. All in all, it's a
very vicious cycle. Anyone who doesn't know what "oscula
