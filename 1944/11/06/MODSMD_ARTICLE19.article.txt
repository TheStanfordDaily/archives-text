Is anyone here interested in south
ern football? After being uncere
moniously dumped by Dixie football
games for three weeks straight, the
Daily's, staff of experts definitely is
not. Last Friday the four Steve
Biodies as a unit lost seven of the
20 games they predicted, and five of
them in de ol' souf, suh! Hereafter
those desiring info on Dixie games
must look elsewhere, as the eggsperts
are resolved not to play with dyna
mite anymore.
Getting back in the groove. Yours
take the lead again with a seasonal
average of .700; Jimmy Weinberg
and Gord Levy each called 13 right
season tallies of .(>BO and .660
respectively; and Barney Gugel re
mained in a solid last, hitting only 11
games on the nose for an average of
.600. Mort Cohen managed to stay in
a tie for first place by hiding in a
barrel while the prognostications
were being made, so that he retains
his previous average.
Here are the scores of the games

, who got them right.
Notre Dame Dumped
Cornell 25, Columbia 7. All.
Yale 6, Dartmouth 0. All but Wein
berg.
Navy 32, Notre Dame 13. Adams.
Michigan 41. Penn 19. All.
Ohio State 21. Indiana 7. All but
Gugel.

Texas Tech 13, Rice 7. None.
