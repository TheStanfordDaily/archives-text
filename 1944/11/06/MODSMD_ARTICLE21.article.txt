# Grant Runs Wild In 'Arsenic’ Film
## 
### 
| ARSENIC AND OLD LACE—now
j playing at the Stanford Theater.
Cary Grant dons his Mickey Mouse
| face and runs wild in Warner's "Ar
senic and Old Lace," a cleaned-up
j version of the stage play in which
I the crazy problems of the zany Brew
j ster family are presented.
The two old maids who delight in
elderberry wine (with an arsenic
j chaser) reign supreme until Ray
mond Massey, as Jonathan Brewster,
J enters with further diabolical intents.
; Much loud-mouthed humor ensues
i until most of the Brewster family
j ends up in sanitariums.
The antics of Grant and company
| are at times rather strained and a
j large percentage of the laughs come
i by sheer physical exertion. But then
| some people relish this raucous
| Frank Capra humor.
At the final fade-out Grant is rav
| ing about how he's a "son of a sea
! cook" which is certainly different
I from the same scene of the play.
"Music In Manhattan" is a rather
ambitious second feature that com
| bines music, comedy, and romance,
j Oh. show me the way to go home!
