BETII Mac VICAR

Complete, sincere acceptance of the individual for what he is, whether
or not his attitude seems irritating, frightening, shocking, dull, or unpleasant
t 0 you—that is the general rule of behavior prescribed by Dr. Gretchen Ann
Magaret in dealing with returning servicemen who are facing with difficulty
the period of readjustment to civilian life.
In speaking to the War Social Adjustments group of the 'Y,' Dr. Magaret

♦■outlined some of the trends which
might be expected from these men—
qualities of hostility, uncertainty, loss
! of self esteem, so-called combat re
t siduals, and worry caused by dis
ruption of family relationships.
Describes Typical Case
Dr. Magaret described the instance
j of a discharged soldier who was filled
with resentment, and anger against
| the gaiety and emotional display of ;
J civilians at a football game. This
(hostility and aggression against en
vironment has always been a tend
| ency during and after wars. Men
feel anger at civilians—wish they
could be bombed a few times, so that
| they would understand. These men
| may have been frustrated in their
I plans by military discipline, or their
I hostility may be rooted in a basic
injustice. Furthermore, they have
long been trained in hostility, and
fatigue may have depleted their self
| control.
i Men Feel Useless
Men who have lost their self-es- I
J teem or belief in their abilities to
! reenter a world of competition have
; frequently been affected by their ac
customed dependency upon the army
| discipline, or their rapid promotion
in the ranks which has given them a i
; position of authority which they will j
j be unable to duplicate in civilian j
: life.
Adding to the serviceman's feeling 1
of inadequacy is the PN label of the
psychoneurotic which Dr. Magaret
believes is being rather indiscrimi- 1
nately applied to discharges by draft i
boards—"a label incomprehensible j
and somehow disgraceful to him."
To others the war has brought the
i inability to make decisions, because |
their lives have been so completely !
disrupted that they no longer have
trust in planning ahead.
Some Relate Experiences
Some men will be infected with the
| desire to talk, tell everything they !
; experienced; others will be morose i
and silent. These reactions are com- j
bat residuals, usually temporary but I
largely dependent in length upon
the understanding of civilians.
Servicemen often dread returning
: home to their wives or families fear
! ing they have grown too far apart.
The wife in this case should try to -
! be flexible in her attitude and the !
! husband's understanding of changes, j
To other servicemen, the knowledge :
| of security has been the most im- \
j portant factor in tiding them over |
J combat strain.
Accept him without reservation, |
; said Dr. Magaret, for "to understand ;
completely is to forgive completely." J
