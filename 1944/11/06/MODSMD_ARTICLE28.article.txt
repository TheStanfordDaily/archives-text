NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (U.R)—'The na-
I tion goes to ihe polls tomorrow to !
j choose between Franklin D. Roose- ;
; velt and Thomas E. Dewey for the
j Presidency, and tonight it appeared !
j that two unknown factors—the bal-
I lot of the servicemen and the silent
j voter will determine the outcome of
i this historic election.
A late survey showed tonight that

perhaps three million votes will be
cast by men and women in the
Armed Forces. These absentee bal-,
lots have been pouring in from every
war theater where Americans are
fighting. In most states, they will be
counted along with the civilian bal
lots, but in 11 states the counting
will be delayed.
