# World Organization To Follow Dumbarton Oaks Plan--Fisher
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
"The probable Post-War International Organization will be very close to
I what was suggested at Dumbarton Oaks," said Dr. Harold H. Fisher, Pro
fessor of History and Vice-Chairman of Directors of the Hoover War Li
brary.
"The general Assembly will include representatives of every peace
loving nation; perhaps eventually it will also include the Axis nations.

♦ Together with the Assembly will be
the Security Council, an Interna
j tional Court of Justice, and several
I functional Councils.
Most Nations Included
"The Security Council will prob
ably include all large and some small
! nations, but will not be as all in
i elusive as the Assembly. Its job will
be maintaining peace, if necessary by
the use of force. The problem of
; placing troops at its disposal is even
now being discussed in the United
States. The other great powers are
likely to agree without much argu
ment to provide troops.
But Dr. Fisher does not believe
that force will be the most important
) way of maintaining the peace. For
| it Fngland. Russia. China, and the
United States, the four great powers
| are in agreement, no secondary
power will dare challenge them. If
they disagree, no international force
will be able to keep the peace.
The success of a world charter, just
as the success of the United States
i constitution, will depend on the

wholehearted support of those liv- j
i ing under it. That is why force will ;
| be far less important than the work ]
| of the Functional Councils in pre- ;
! venting friction.
A Functional Organization he de
fines as one for the regulation of |
certain problems of modern society.
Already there exist such postal, j
health, and economic organizations.
| And now that scientific advances
i have shrunk the world to such a '
I small size there is need for regula- |
j lion of many other activities such as \
| finance, food, and air traffic. The lat
ter problem is even now being con- I
' sidered in a special international [
meeting at Chicago. Together with ,
j an Economic and Social Council.
: these Functional Committees will be i
! coordinated under the Assembly.
Stronger than League
This international organization. Dr. I
j Fisher feels, will be stronger- than j
I the League of Nations because its i
j commitments will be so much more |
t specific. It will probably be adapt- j
! able enough to be used for at least j
i a generation, which is a long time in j
I these rapidly changing days. At the
! end of that time it will be modified
j or give way to another organization '
which will better fit the changed j
structure of society.
The chief problems in the way of i
such an effective international gov
i eminent are misunderstanding and
i fear of other great powers. This is
j well illustrated by "peace defeatism"
i in which we believe that "Everyone
I is taking advantage of America, and
j none of these plans will be success
ful."
Will-power Necessary
If such problems are to be over- !
j come, there must be the will to j
I overcome them. Most nations want j
j peace, but they must want it enough !
| to make concessions.
International trade will be one ol !
! the most important economic prob
-1 lems, especially the question of mar- j
kets and the sources of such material I
j as oil. Together with this will be '
' the problem of tariffs, and the de
| velopment of dependent, colonial, or
i semi-colonial areas without friction. |
| Economics Solved Too
These economic problems w ill best
i be solved by the use of the previ- j
i ously mentioned functional commit

tees. This implies compromises be
tween nations. The most powerful
ones must be willing to concede
generously some advantage to small
er, weaker countries.
Although not ready to discuss the
details of the Bretton Woods Con
ference. he highly approved its ob
jective, which was to set up* just
such a functional monetary body as
he favors.
As for dealing with Germany and
Japan, Dr. Fisher is against partition
or excessive military occupation. He
does feel that some troops will have
to be kept there until the terms of
the armistice are kept and an accept
able government is set up. He also
favors enough economic aid to make
them self-supporting members of the
world community.

I the League of Nations because its i
j commitments will be so much more |
t specific. It will probably be adapt- j
! able enough to be used for at least j
i a generation, which is a long time in j
I these rapidly changing days. At the

j or give way to another organization '
which will better fit the changed j
structure of society.

such an effective international gov

j none of these plans will be success
ful."
