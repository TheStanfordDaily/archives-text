A. A. Milne's comedy, "The Dover J
Road," will begin Wednesday at 1
8:15 p.m. in the Little Theater for
a five-night run. This is the first
production of the season for the
Stanford Players, and is directed by
F. Cowles Strickland.
Dress rehearsals will take place
tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30
in the Little Theater.
The play concerns the activities of
Mr. Latimer, played by Johnny High,
in taking under his protection ro
mantic couples who are running
away to marry. In his well-fur
nished and eccentric home, the pro- I
balionary couples, played by Sally '
Stocker, Hazel Spore, Newton Ar
nold. and Harvey Small, find them
selves being revealed to each other
in most unromantic situations.
The theory behind wealthy Mr.
Latimer's strange actions is that, j
while those truly in love may not be j
affected by this period of disillusion
ment, those who are embarking upon
an unconsidered marriage will not !
make the fatal mistake after he gets !
through with them.
