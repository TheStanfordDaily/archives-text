# Residences Begin War Stamp Sales
## 
### 
War stamp sales which begin today j
in living groups will continue un- :
! til Thanksgiving vacation, accord- '
| ing to Joe Hawkins, chairman of j
I sales.
Since the beginning of the war each
j Satnford student has pledged to buy
! at least one twenty-five cent stamp {
' every week. The students are asked
jto purchase their $2.50 worth of
| stamps this week for their own con
venience and the simplicity of the j
sales.
Sales will be conducted through
j hall War Board representatives who ,
â€¢ will collect the money for the stamps j
' and turn it in at the War Board of-
I lice.
If men students alone respond 100 |
! per cent to the War Stamp Drive, ap- !
proximately 82,070 will be put to ac- I
tive use in the war effort.
War Board representatives are I
, asked to make their returns as soon
as their hall approaches the 100 per '
cent mark. The remainder may be
turned in at any time before the end
of the quarter.
