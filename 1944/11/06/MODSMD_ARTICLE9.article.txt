II students wish to sit in the rooting section, they must wear white

> blouses or shirts to the game Nov.
18, 2:30 p.m., in the Berkeley Me
j morial Stadium, as card stunts will
! be performed and this is the only
j effective dress. Seating arrangements
| are in Cardinals' hands, and they will
! usher and seat those without white

; ing to Emerson.

Students who signed up to sell
tickets are asked to meet with Jim
Emerson at 1 p.m. today at the tic
ket window in the ASSU office.

Besides card stunts, Ric Supple,
cheer leader, will conduct yells and
songs. The Stanford Band will play
and perform stunts between halves.
Only one ticket will be sold to a
person upon presentation of a stu
dent body card, but a man may buy
two by presenting his date's card
along with his own.
Tickets will be on sale every after
noon this week from 1 to 4:30 until
they sell out. If more are needed,
they will be sent for, although it is
problematical if they can be spared,
Emerson said. After all tickets are
sold, there will be a sign-up sheet in
the ASSU office for those students
who were unable to get them. Then
if more should come, these students
will have priority.
Ticket-buyers may leave their
names and addresses at the sales
window so that if some transporta
tion should be worked out, they may
be contacted. Also, those who will
be taking cars to the game and do
not have a full load are asked to
leave their names so that all jsos
sible facilities may be utilized. Be
fore the game, bus and train sched
ules to Berkeley will be posted.
