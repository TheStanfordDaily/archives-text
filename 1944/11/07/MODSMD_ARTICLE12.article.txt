Today is election day in the United States of America.
To many people, this day means many things—to some it
means long hours of official work, to war workers it means time
away from a vital job, to politicians it means career, to statesmen
it means the future of our country.
But for students, this election day has special meaning. It
is an affirmation of our knowledge of the American way of life,
a knowledge that we have gained from books, from lectures,
from corny Hollywood movies—perhaps something we have not
quite believed in.
This election, this vote, during World War 11, 1944, however,
gives us a foundation for a new belief, a new faith, in America.
