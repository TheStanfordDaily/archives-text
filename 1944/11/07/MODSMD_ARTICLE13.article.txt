# BULL SESSION

### Dick Crane 
(In reference to the Daily of Thursday, November 2, 1944)
CAMPUS OPINION
Yesterday's Bull Session was neither interesting nor amusing.
The reader was asked to take time to peruse the column. Such
wasted effort (even at eight o'clock)! If it was worth while, the
request would not be necessary to attract interest.
The author thinks much too highly of himself for the caliber
of his output, but the fault is not entirely his. In order to fulfill
the demand for a column he is unable to be consistently hu
morous.
His latest attempt was not only a failure, it was a disgusting
failure. With its omission, the Daily might have passed for a
college publication.
The alleged purpose of the Bull Session is to provoke laughter
or at least a grin. But is that objective being qualitatively ful
filled? I think not.
Perhaps the difficulty can be tied in with the term "mo
nopoly." Why should one person attempt to write the daily Bull
Session? It must, no doubt, be a heavy tax'on his brain to supply
four-fifths of the output; otherwise the ultimate result would not
be such an imperfect product, steadily deteriorating.
In both the short and long run, I believe the standard of the
Daily could be greatly improved if effort and labor were dis
tributed among a number of potential humorists. One should be
able to find a surplus on a campus this size.
Something needs to be done!
