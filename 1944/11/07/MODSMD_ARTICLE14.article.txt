# ELECTION ISSUES

### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Today is the day of decision, when
the electorate chooses its leadership
for the next four years. Since poli
tics has started to make sense since
1932, as Dr. Philip Buck of the Po
litical Science Department puts it,
and these are important times, a
good number of the issues involved
are of extreme importance.
The first in the minds of every
body is the rapid and efficient win
ning of the war. Now the war has
not exactly been mismanaged. If it
had. we wouldn't be winning it so
overwhelmingly. The electorate is
therefore concerned with whether or
not the opposition can do a better j
job in gaining the victory.
War Management
When it is said that the war has j
not been badly mismanaged, that
does not mean that any argument
claiming that there has been some—
even a great deal—of corruption and
mismanagement is ipso facto thrown
nit. The Republicans might and do
•joint to a great number of bureaus
naking the effort of production and
.apply in this cour.tr> more cumber
some by virtue of the bonds of red
. ipe. The new factor of a certain
,imount of diplomatic mismanage- '
»non'. was thr own if to the race by

! Governor Dewey last Saturday night.
However the Democrats can make
the very logical retort that there have
been mistakes, as-there must be in
anything so gigantic as the mobiliza
tion of our resources, but they have
been honestly and sincerely made in
the effort to get things done, and the
j over-all picture of thier conduct
must be good, or things would not
have gone so well.
Peace
Then there is the issue of the win
ning of the peace. The Democrats
point to Mr. Roosevelt's experience
I in Foreign Affairs, to his contacts
with the foremost leaders of the
I world, and to the reactionary senti
j merits of the Republican party. Gov.
I Dewey claims to have a non-partisan
program worked out with Secretary
of State Hull that the Republican
members of congress will support.
He also points to certain weaknesses
in previous. Democratic foreign pol
icy. Many voters, however, are a
little leary of Governor Dewey's
policy since, while Mr. Roosevelt has
stated his position on the amount of
power to be given to our delegate
to the United Nations, what they
consider to be the crucial issue in
the- field of foreign policy, in his ad
dr.'"<s t the Foreign Policy Assoc.. -

tion, Governor Dewey has more 01
less sidestepped the question.

The third big question concerns i
postwar jobs and security. The Re- i
publicans point to the 10.000,000 un
employed in 1939 and say that we j
were the last out of the depression.
The Democrats reply, that it was a
Republican depression, that the Re
publicans did nothing with it, that
the main reason we were in so long
was that the Republicans prevented
us from passing the extreme social i
legislation resorted to in other coun- j
tries. Republicans point to Mr. j
Roosevelt's "war on business," while j
the Democrats retort that the Re- |
publicans are the party of the big I
industrialists and the extreme cut- !
throat approach to the conduct of [
domestic economy that brought the j
the whole calamity of 1929 about.

When it is said that the war has j
not been badly mismanaged, that
does not mean that any argument
claiming that there has been some—
even a great deal—of corruption and
mismanagement is ipso facto thrown

However the Democrats can make
