# Firemen Meet Gerona Today
## 
### 
The question of who will grab the
pennant in intramural touch football
play will be extended to the second
round of games this afternoon at
4:30 on the four green, but very
slippery practice fields. Coach Elwyn
Bugge, acting head of intramural
sports, emphasized that only a hur
ricane will cause postponement, since
the fields are finally in shape for
play in the dew.
In League I Nu Sigma Nu (Med.
School III) will contest Arthur Hall's
snappy outfit. Company C is favored
to grind over Toyon's Operators in
\a game that may well decide the
final outcome.
Other games in League I find
Buchanan's Bearcats mixing with
the Sequoia Roughs, both teams con
fident of victory; and Alpha Kappa
Kappa (Med. School I) tackling En
cina Flyers.
Featured game in League II is the
Firehouse-Gerona A.C. contest which
brings together two unbeaten teams.
Meanwhile, Arguello A.A. is expected
to hang up a win over Toyon's Dead
End Kids.
Med. School II faces Washington
Hall and Kappa Dee-Gee Hashers

uled lilts.
