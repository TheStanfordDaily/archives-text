# Versatile Farm Mailman Tells Hobbies, Interests
## 
### RUTH BENJAMIN 
Stanford's well-liked Special-Delivery Mailman, the cheerful, tall, gray-
I aired and moustached man is a familiar figure around the campus on his
hike (or in his jalopy on rainy days).
When asked his name, he replied, "Oh, I have several names," listing
Mr Chips," "Cupid." and "Mercury." His authentic name is Robert D.

Col Iyer, and his disposition is Scotch
(he says he never touches Bourbon).
He likes to see a good play, he en
joys fine music, but books are his
greatest interest. After graduating
from Berkeley, he opened the first
book store in Palo Alto. "The Palo
Alto Book Shop." He insists that
books are not a luxury, but a neces
sity in a democracy. American citi
zens must be well-informed to use
their rights and privileges intelli
gently.
Discusses Book
Discussing a book which he is now
reading, "Innocents at Cedro," by
K. L. Duff us, he said the book is
very interesting to him because of
it:; clever humor, because Cedro Cot
tage is an old landmark of Stanford,
snd because Thorstein Veblen, whom
the story concerns, was a friend of
his. Veblen bought his will in Mr.
Cidiver's book shop the day before
he died. R. L. Duffus, the author,
who graduated from Stanford in 1908.
V.ms also a friend of his.
Hi favorite hobby is gardening.
:ind his wife, who have lived in
I' .In Alto since 192t>, haven't bought
f< vegetable for years. He gets up at
each morning to work in the
sard ;n, and also works in it after
noons. He grows tomatoes, carrots,
U'Huce, onions, and many other
wgciables.
Hi recently gave 40 pounds of to
m iioes and onions to Durand House
• ii<l Jane Lathrop House. During the
i<;.si summer he made almost 300 jars
ol jelly. He gave some of his spe
t.i< li , carrot-tomato jelly, to Durand
H- u. e last month, and the girls are
still raving about how delicious it
\ iS
*V-.i« hes Romances
"C jpid." as some Stanfordites call
hiiti. delights in watching romances.
1 h' divulged that one Stanford coupie
nukes "fond farewells" a regular oc-
I'liir. nce every morning at a certain
i down near the Physics Build
in a.
His pet peeve is the bicycle situa
tion at Branner. Instead of leaving
si oi • s of them piled up, and out in
all kinds of weather, he suggests that
Ki Htiner install bike racks and put up
=i canvas ceiling in the/ inner court.
Hi' says that when he comes gaily up
on his bike to deliver mail, he can
hardly get through the "jungle."
Mr. Collyer has a son, a Navy lieu
t.•»«.•!it now in the Pacific, who at
tend ;d Stanford.
h» likes his job very much be
caii. ■ it is interesting, out-of-doors,
in n oeautiful environment, and most
of mli because "Stanford people seem
mi pleasant." Instead of saying
"Goodbye, Mr. Chips," they say
"(»<x d morning, Mr. Chips."
