# 'Dover Road,' Comedy Hit, Will Open Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
"The Dover Road," A. A. Milne's
sparkling English comedy hit. will
open tomorrow night in the Little
Thea tatre 8:15 as the Stanford Play
ers present their first effort of the
season.
The play is directed by F. Cowles
Strickland, and features Johnny High
as Mr. Latimer, the wealthy eccentric
who keeps a very strange household
for the purpose of enjoying his even
stranger hobby.
Elopements
Harvey Small as Nicholas, Newton
Arnold as Leonard. Hazel Spore as
Anne, and Sally Stocker as Eustacia
are cast as four people about to set
out on a new life via the "Dover
Road" when they come under the
benevolent protection of the unpre
dictable Mr. Latimer.
In charge of Mr. house
hold is Dominic, the epitome of all
good butlers, who will undoubtedly
bring bitter tears of reminiscence to
those hard hit by war time's little
problems. Dominic, played by Joa
quin Aguirre, possesses the disturb
ing quality of appearing suddenly
when wanted by Mr. Latimer, and
appearing sometimes when others
don't especially want him.
Domestic Start'
The startlingly efficient staff man
aged by Dominic includes Carl
Strahm, Mary Cogswell, Charles
Letts, and Janice Swan.
Tall, austere Mr. Latimer, charac
terized by a knowledge of what is
correct and a mild disrespect for that
knowledge is portrayed by John
High, a discharged veteran who is
returning to Stanford to complete
his senior vear in drama.

Clinging Blonde
Sally Stacker, as blonde Eustasia,
simpers and clings throughout three
acts as a powerful maternal instinct
is shown to be amazingly frustrated.
Newton Arnold, appearing as
Leonard, wanders around, confused
by the whole process, and eloquently
performing even the slightest or most
pleasurable action "under protest."
He is typed as a very tweedy, Brit
ish gentleman.
Nicholas, played by Harvey Small,
appears as a somewhat disillusioned
product of Mr. Latimer's excellent
brand of "treatment." 4
