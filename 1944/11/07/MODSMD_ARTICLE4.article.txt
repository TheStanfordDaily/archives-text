### LEONARD LOW 
To clarify the propositions and
amendments on the California bal
lot, the Daily presents a summary of
j each of the 12 issues to be voted on
I today:
No. 1. This referendum on a law
passed by the legislature provides
j for a $30,000,000 bond issue to be
i floated to provide a loan fund for
j veterans to purchase farms and
j homes.
No. 2. This amendment extends
I partial tax exemption to members of
{ the armed services not previously
I covered.
| No. 3. This amendment empowers
; the legislature to fix the salaries of
; certain high state officers, whose re-
I muneration is now fixed in the Con
j stitution.
No. 4. -This empowers the legisla
j ture to exempt non-profit religious,
! hospital, and charitable organizations
from taxation, whereas under the
| present law all exemptions are spe
cifically in the Constitution. The ob
jection to this amendment is based on
j the alleged desirability of the pres
j ent system and the fear of. lobbying
if the amendment is adopted.
No. 5. This permits the legislature
to provide for the reinstatement of
| public officers serving in the armed
j forces.
No. 6. This provides for an annual
session of the legislature instead of
J the present biennial sessions, and
| eliminates the present split session
j which requires a 30-day recess after
the introduction of bills before they
may be voted on. The objection to
this amendment stresses the value
of the 30-day breathing period and
points out that the governor may call
a special session whenever it is nec
essary.
No. 7. This provides for an in
crease in the expenses allowed legis
lators, not to exceed that permitted
other elected state officers.
No. 8. This measure proposes to
validate tax 'deeds property sold for
delinquent taxes if the validity of the
deed is not attacked within one year.
, This is designed to clear up a very
j bad situation, but opponents doubt
whether the cure is not worse than
I the evil as the amendment is vague
and does not go to the root of the
problem.
No. 9. This amendment requires
the State to increase its support of
the elementary school system by
66%.
No. 10. This amendment permits
the legislature to waive for the dura
tion the Constitutional prohibition
against increasing the salary of lo
cal officers during their terms of of
fice, and supporters urge its passage
in view of the wartime difficulty in
finding qualified personnel to serve
for the present rate of compensation.
No. 11. The proponents of this
amendment want to pay $60 per
month to all citizens over 60, to be
financed by a 3% gross income tax
to be collected monthly, repealing
the sales and use taxes. Opponents
claim that the plan will result in
economic instability and withdrawal
of federal pension funds from the
state.
No. 12. Tliis is the so-called, right
to work amendment, sponsored by
the Los Angeles Merchants and Man
ufacturers Association and designed
to eliminate the closed Organ
ized labor and business groups in
cluding the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce oppose the measure on
the ground that it is too broad and
would cripple the entire labor move
ment. and also that the labor strife
it would cause would be inimical to
the utmost prosecution of the war
effort.
