### LEONARD LOW 
To clarify the propositions and
amendments on the California bal
lot, the Daily presents a summary of
j each of the 12 issues to be voted on
I today:
No. 1. This referendum on a law
passed by the legislature provides
j for a $30,000,000 bond issue to be
i floated to provide a loan fund for
j veterans to purchase farms and
j homes.
No. 2. This amendment extends
I partial tax exemption to members of
{ the armed services not previously
I covered.
| No. 3. This amendment empowers
; the legislature to fix the salaries of
; certain high state officers, whose re-
I muneration is now fixed in the Con
j stitution.
No. 4. -This empowers the legisla
j ture to exempt non-profit religious,
! hospital, and charitable organizations
from taxation, whereas under the
| present law all exemptions are spe
cifically in the Constitution. The ob
jection to this amendment is based on
j the alleged desirability of the pres
j ent system and the fear of. lobbying
if the amendment is adopted.
No. 5. This permits the legislature
to provide for the reinstatement of
| public officers serving in the armed
j forces.
No. 6. This provides for an annual
session of the legislature instead of
J the present biennial sessions, and
| eliminates the present split session
j which requires a 30-day recess after
the introduction of bills before they
may be voted on. The objection to
this amendment stresses the value
of the 30-day breathing period and
points out that the governor may call
a special session whenever it is nec
essary.
No. 7. This provides for an in
crease in the expenses allowed legis
lators, not to exceed that permitted
other elected state officers.
No. 8. This measure proposes to
validate tax 'deeds property sold for
delinquent taxes if the validity of the
deed is not attacked within one year.
, This is designed to clear up a very
j bad situation, but opponents doubt
whether the cure is not worse than
I the evil as the amendment is vague
