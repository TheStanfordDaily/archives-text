# Campus Odds Swing to F.D.R.
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
With campaigns officially closed
and voting-day just eight hours
away, the consensus on campus yes
terday was that Roosevelt would
take the election by a broad margin.
Others, however, were steadfast in
their faith thai Dewey would win
like Bob Rubenstein who maintained
that every man in Monroe Hall is
positive of a Republican victory.
"We're just lying in wait for a Roose
velt man who'll give us five to one
odds." he commented.
Rachel Dole, looking sadly at her
row of Dewey buttons, predicted a
Roosevelt victory. Leonard Low,
who headed arrangements for the
mock elections, said that Dewey will
not receive more than 190 electoral
votes.
Fireside at Roth House
Roth House plans a fireside in the
living room, so that all may listen
together to the returns. Said Bar
bara Lyon, "We have high hopes that
Dewey will win." Cocoa will be
served to the listeners; but "it'll be
champagne if Dewey wins," accord
ing to a voice in the background.
Pat Robert, mourning the fact that

she will be studying for a history
test, was comforted by the reported
statement of Mr. Dayton Phillips
that students who can't study and
listen to the radio at the same time
should not be in Stanford. It will be
done en masse tomorrow night, ac
cording to reports.
Lagunita President Says:
Louise Kaiser, Lagunita president,
said that Roosevelt will probably win.
"Had the election taken place a
month ago, I believe Dewey would
have taken it. There has been a
swing in reaction to his campaign,
however, that will probably result in
his defeat."
Residents of Casa Granada will
cluster about the radio in the social
room and listen to returns while hav
ing a spi'ead. Granada was sur
prised last week to find every room
on the lower floor decorated with
pictures of the Republican candidate.
Farm Men Say:
Sequoia reports that or.e man
promises to grow a beard till Christ
mas if Roosevelt wins.
daily Reviewer Dick Bower prom
ises to buy everyone on campus a
bottle of beer if Dewev winsâ€” plus

promising to write a favorable re
view. Attention, voters.
David Morledge predicted that
Dewey would win, but that the out
come is dependent on the New York
State vote. The independent vote
will, he said, be small this year.
Reaction
One adamant Republican asserted,
"If Roosevelt wins, I shall start man
ufacturing 1948 Dewey posters out
of my Western Civ Blue Books.
Eucalypto room-mates on oppos
ing sides fear a major conflict to
morrow night, but predict a Roose
velt victory since only one, the pro-
Rooseveltian, can vote.
Said Virginia Burks, when asked
who would win. *'I could have sworn
I heard a seal bark." Let's face it,
Burks.
Jim Weinberg's entire fortune,
plus a 111 square, depends on the
outcome. When asked what he
would do "if the entail lad from
N.Y. should win," he said, "Let's
not discuss the impossible."
Although the final results may not
be known for several weeks, we hope
Stanford's 30' will use their pre
rogative.
