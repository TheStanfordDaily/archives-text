### 
LONDON, Nov. 6 (UP). â€”Premier
Joseph Stalin compared the Japa
nese attack on the United States at
Pearl Harbor to Adolph Hitler's at
tack on Russia, linking Japan with
Germany today as an aggressor na
tion, and said that after the war ag
gressors must be completely dis
armed.
To the roaring cheers of his audi
tors on the 27th anniversary cele
bration of the Bolshevik revolution,
Stalin said that Hungary would
soon be out of the war, that the Red
Army probably would be in Berlin
soon, and that the Allies wei'e on
the brink of winning the war.
Admitting occasional differences
of opinion among the Allies, Stalin
said that nevertheless the United
States and Groat Britain were co
operating in unprecedented unity
which he asserted would survive the
war.
He called for a postwar organiza -
tion which would provide an armed
force ready to choke at the outset
any attempt at war-mongering, and
he warned that Germany already
was preparing for another war.
