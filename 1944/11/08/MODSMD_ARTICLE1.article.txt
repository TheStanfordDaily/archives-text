A clear Democratic trend from the earliest
returns assured Franklin Delano Roosevelt his
fourth term as president of the United States
this morning as one of the most bitter cam
paigns of recent times was ended.
With the solid south giving the Democratic
candidate a bulge in the popular vote, Roose
velt continued to capture pivotal states until a
substantial lead was piled up early last evening,
and at 9 p.m. an "unexpected miracle was neces
sary for the Republican candidate to get back
in the running."
Throughout the nation the senatorial victors
continued the trend toward the Democratic
party.
Defeat of Clare Booth Luce in Connecticut,
Hamilton Fish in New York, and the victory of
Sheridan Downey seemed imminent late last
night.
In the rising tide of Democratic victory last
night the early leads gained by the Democrats

in key and questionable states such as Califor
nia, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and Mis
souri.
i Thomas E. Dewey could count on the elec
toral votes of Michigan, Ohio, some of the New
England states and the farm belt states from
early evening returns.
The Roosevelt percentage of the popular vote
was more than five per cent greater than the
New York Governor's throughout the tabula
tion of the national vote.
Roosevelt's small lead in Oregon was grow
ing as returns there neared their final tabula
-1 tion.
By 7 p.m. (PWT) Vice-President Henry Wal
lace declared a Democratic victory, though up
until press time last night, Governor Dewey
refused to concede defeat. The Cleveland,
Ohio "Plain-Dealer" and the "New York Herald-
Tribune" conceded the election to President
Roosevelt late last night.
