# FROM WHERE WE STAND
## 
### 
Today the presidency of the United States is
assured to a man who has borne the merciless
venom of the world's greatest political cauldron
for four successive campaigns.
The task before the President would be pro
digious even for a man ten years younger of
egual experience, it is now one to test the great
est capacities of any man, and this man knows
that more than twenty million people in this
nation would have preferred somebody else.
How history judges Mr. Roosevelt we will
never know clearly, and that is not our problem.
It is our business to gain the skills which our
education at Stanford offers, and for which we
have an extraordinary responsibility to those
who cannot obtain those skills. In this critical
:ime we find that the overwhelming sentiment
of those about vis is at divergence with the will
Df the nation as a whole. We must spare no ef
ort to examine and re-examine the passions and
ntellectual honesty that mould the convictions
vhich will be ours during this "fourth term."
The socalled history to be made by Mr. Roose
't i".\ the next tour years, we should not de

ceive ourselves about it, shall affect the most
private life and the most secure future.
This election shows, as our elections have
shown over the years since the depression, that
the two parties have become less and less rec-_
onciliable. While we enjoy the luxury of the
student skepticism, we should establish for our
selves the right of our views to exist in our na
tion, or we should be prepared to see the rift
widen further among the American people.
One way to achieve the strength of indepen
dent convictions, is to place out of our minds
the very comfortable idea that politics for us
ends with the campaign of 1944; they begin
today if we want peace and security in the
world, and if we are prepared to find the men
and the laws to aid in the work to be done. Like
it or not, Mr. Roosevelt has the pledge and the
faith of the people to do this. Our duty is clear.
