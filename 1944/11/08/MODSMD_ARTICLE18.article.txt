# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
Your unfunny columnist will not try to make
a vain attempt at humor today, as this is his
"off-day." Besides, yesterday's letter scared
hell out of me.
Today I am going to agitate. I v/ant to plug
for a barbecue similar to the one of last Sun
day evening in the Women's Gymnasium. Why
can't this affair be a regular twice-monthly
event? I wandered over that way on Sunday,
not only to see the beautiful coeds, but also
because I was hungry, and what do I see, but
a huge mass of starving people, patiently stand
ing in line to get a small portion of food. There
was dancing in the gym for those who were in
clined to that form of emotional outlet, there
was a congenial atmosphere of "glad to see
ya," and in general a "hubbah, hubbah" spirit
prevailed.
The "Goose" gave out with a few Stanford
songs and yells, and you could see the long
buried Stanford spirit being revived in that
very instant.
Now that football is a thing of the past here
at Stanford, with the exception of Sher's KAP
PA DEE-GEE HASHERS (they haven't won a
game), I feel that the only way for every Stan
ford student to get together, and be a close
knit student organization, is through an event
such as the barbecue of last Sunday.
Three living groups of the campus put the
affair on, so why not have the other living
groups of the campus "pitch in" and m this
way, no particular living group would get the
job very often during the quarter. It would be
possible to have the men's living groups co
operate in this proposed project also.
I don't know how it would be possible to put
this idea through, but if there is enough interest,
I v/ill be very glad to institute the beginning
proceedings. There is nothing I would rather
do than to make life exciting around this cam
pus.
"A funeral wreath" to Joe Sher (the Stanford
Daily's Hedda Hopper), for cutting his Monday
column. It was a veritable "panic." How do I
know? He told me so, as he was rolling on the
floor with uncontrolled mirth.
One more thing before I close today's ses
sion. In reference to yesterday's letter of criti
cism of Bull Session, I wish to make a short
comment myself. I gave her the first blow.
Miss Rush, seems to think there is a surplus
of hidden humor talent on the campus, and that
someone should help me write Bull Session.
For any aid along that line, I would be very
thankful, as that handshake I get weekly for
writing this column does not pay for my room
rent. In reading her letter, I have picked up the
idea that she is somewhat of a humorist. To her
I wish to extend an invitation to write next
Tuesday's Bull Session. As a matter of fact, I
will make it a personal challenge. How about
it Irene. Here is a chance to prove your gripe.
