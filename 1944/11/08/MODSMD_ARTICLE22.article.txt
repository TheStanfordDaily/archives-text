win over the Sequoia Roughs. Show
ing fine form were Bud Richter and
Fonny Ho, the two tailbacks, whose
passing combination clicked for both
touchdowns. The game was close,
and the passing of Ho made the dit —
ference.
Med. 11l Hot
With Dave Brown, Jack Heald and
Co. leading the attack, Arthur Hall
never knew what hit them, and suc
combed to a 48-0 shellacking. Ar
thur was not in the same class with
ie Med. students. Brown, an all-
Coast and from UCLA* and a great
soph star from Stanford, scored
twice and then let the rest of his
teammates divide the other touch
downs among themselves. Heald,
also a great UCLA star with Brown
and an ex-captain of the Stanford
fiosh team, did most of the passing.
Co. C pounded out a 19-0 win over
Toyon South and Med. I squeezed
out a 2-0 margin over the Encina
Fivers. Leading the Med. students

was Toby Freedman. ex-Cal line
man.
Arguello Victorious
Arguello A.C., undefeated and one
of the top contenders for the crown,
had little trouble in putting away
Toyon North, 20-0; Morley Thomp
son, Dick Jennings, and Jim Brad
shaw split the scoring honors. One
of the most beautiful plays of the day
is credited to Jennings, who skirted
almost the length of the field to score
die first touchdown.
I Hashers Sparkle
Running hos-wild for the Kappa
Dee-Gee Hashers were Ed Luce, Joe
Sher, and Ric Supple, who paced
their team to a 34-G win over Tyler.
In their first game, their vaunted
passing attack seemed to be clogged,
| but from all indications, they have
j hit their stride and are raring to go.
In the closest game of the day, Fire
-1 house nosed out Gerona, 7—(>, with
1 Hood scoring the all-important con
j version on a pass. Nesbitt scored
I for the firemen, and Hamlin tallied
