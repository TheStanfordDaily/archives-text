## 
### 
Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson, professor of American history and
executive head of the History Department, has a particular interest in this
election, for his special field has been study of pr esidential votes since 1896.
He has made a map indicating distribution of national party votes by

counties, including every election
year from 1896 to the last election.
Results of his survey are published
in a series of volumes entitled "The
Presidential Vote."
"The 1944 election will be the most
complicated survey of any election,"
he states. He has written seveial
interesting books on American his
tory including "The Foreign Policy
of Woodrow Wilson," and"The Evo
lution of American Political Parties."
Professor Robinson has been on
the Stanford faculty for many years.
Gave Heart to Stanford
"It is now 33 years since I first
came up the Palm Drive, saw the
Quad lying in the July sunshine,
smelled the tar weed, and gave my
heart to Stanford," he declares. He
has witnessed the school's develop
ment into a great national univer
sity and though at intervals he has
taught in other schools including
University of Minnesota, Yale, Co
lumbia, and California, he has al
ways returned eagerly and thank
fully to Stanford.
He came to Stanford as an As
sistant Professor of History. For
twenty years he witnessed the His
tory Department grow in size and
importance to become known for its
unique approach in individual guid
ance of students and seminars for
undergraduates. Graduate work in
the department has become increas
ingly important and students have
gone into all parts of the United
States and abroad.
History Stressed
The Department has stressed His
tory for liberal education, prepara
tion for citizenship, and for profes
sional studies, particularly Law and
Business. Regional studies have bqpn
stressed including modern Japan,
Canada, Russia, the Far East, and
Latin America. An important fea
ture of the department is independ
ent study.
Professor Robinson has many fond
memories of students who have stud
ied under him during past years. He
has known many who have distin

guished themselves in their fields.
He has encountered Stanford stu
dents throughout the world. One
j day in Paris he stepped from a hotel
j into the street and was hailed with a
| greeting, "Hello Mr. Robinson." He
faced a student who had graduated
from the school of medicine during
the previous year.
His department faculty has been
j very active in war service, several
members are in civilian service and
! several are in the army and navy,
i Three Ph.D's of the Department were
| American advisors at the Dumbarton
I Oaks Conference. Last year 1,500 to
j 2,000 men in uniform were enrolled
in American history.
Regional History
The study of history by regions is
| a new idea. The department has a
number of distinguished scholars in
j these fields, and has done much pio
neer work which will be important
iin years after the war. Stanford
j leads in studies of the first World
' War and work of the department has
i been closely related to the Hoover
j Library.
Favors Independent Study
Professor Robinson envisions
j spread of the independent study idea
j with more instructors for superior
I students. "I see more emphasis on
i the meaning and significance of lib
! eral education or education for free
j men and women." he declares.
At present he is studying "Popu
| lation Changes in California'' for
I the Commonwealth Club in San
I Francisco. He plans in the future
I to raise camellias that are as good
as the ones of his colleagues, to talk
[ to his nephew when he returns from
j the South Pacific, and to continue
J teaching Stanford men and women.

has known many who have distin

guished themselves in their fields.
He has encountered Stanford stu

faced a student who had graduated

the previous year.
His department faculty has been

Regional History
The study of history by regions is
| a new idea. The department has a
number of distinguished scholars in

Favors Independent Study
Professor Robinson envisions
j spread of the independent study idea

j men and women." he declares.
At present he is studying "Popu

Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson, professor of American history and
executive head of the History Department, has a particular interest in this
election, for his special field has been study of pr esidential votes since 1896.
He has made a map indicating distribution of national party votes by

counties, including every election
year from 1896 to the last election.
Results of his survey are published
in a series of volumes entitled "The
Presidential Vote."
"The 1944 election will be the most
complicated survey of any election,"
he states. He has written seveial
interesting books on American his
tory including "The Foreign Policy
of Woodrow Wilson," and"The Evo
lution of American Political Parties."
Professor Robinson has been on
the Stanford faculty for many years.
Gave Heart to Stanford
"It is now 33 years since I first
came up the Palm Drive, saw the
Quad lying in the July sunshine,
smelled the tar weed, and gave my
heart to Stanford," he declares. He
has witnessed the school's develop
ment into a great national univer
sity and though at intervals he has
taught in other schools including
University of Minnesota, Yale, Co
lumbia, and California, he has al
ways returned eagerly and thank
fully to Stanford.
He came to Stanford as an As
sistant Professor of History. For
twenty years he witnessed the His
tory Department grow in size and
importance to become known for its
unique approach in individual guid
ance of students and seminars for
undergraduates. Graduate work in
the department has become increas
ingly important and students have
gone into all parts of the United
States and abroad.

The Department has stressed His
tory for liberal education, prepara

Business. Regional studies have bqpn
