# Branner Women Have Poll Party
## 
### 
Dinner at Branner Hall last night
took the form of an election eve
party, complete with almost full size
sketches of the G.O.P. Elephant and
Democratic Donkey and with each
table representing a voting state.
Doris Hardman acted as chairman
of preparations, and ballotting took
place under the direction of the pre
siding officer of the evening, Chris
Beck.
Also assisting on the committee
were Carmen Fuqua, Beatrice Snive
ly, Marian Fraser, and Kearny Luers.
