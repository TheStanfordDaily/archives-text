arral is one of the great artistic feats
of the ages." So stated Barney Gugel,
Chappie editor, in an exclusive in

ment. explaining, "Fayram drew 200
miniature figures of the 0.8. on each
; of the 9 pages, which makes 1,800 Old
■ Boys. Multiply this by 3.000 copies,

entire Daily staff off campus. You
may get his autograph between 6

headed up Palm Drive reciting the
famous Walt Whitman poem, "Th<
