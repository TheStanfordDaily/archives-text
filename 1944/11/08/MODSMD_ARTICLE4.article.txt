'Ya wanta bet?"
Enthusiastic Roosevelt backers
prowled around the Stanford cam
pus last night as news bulletins
steadily slanted towards the Demo
cratic column and Farm Republi
cans gently beat their heads against
their radios and moaned.
"I wore Landon, Willkie, and
Dewey buttons," Elaine Wood, La
gunita, sighed.
"It's us against the world," a Gra
nada-ite agreed, pondering over La
gunita's dinner-time vote last night
which resulted in 209 votes for
Dewey, 73 for Roosevelt, 6 for
Thomas, and 1 for head hasher Bill
Sutphen.
Banners marked on opposite sides
"Roosevelt" and "Dewey," waved
over the dining room tables last
night, while Sutphen announced
over the loudspeaker, "Please leave
the banners on the tables. We want
to save them to use in 1948."
Voting for her first time, a Union
student started to the polls yester
day. She was undecided about her
vote for president, but she wore a
hat, gloves, and even her pre-war
nylons for "that date for democracy."
Roble's election dinner was key
noted by Republican strains of "It's
the Socialist herd, that makes you
want to bird .... my eyes aren't
dim and I can see, so I will vote for
Tom Dewey." Three pseudo-pro
hibitionists paraded signs saying
"Down With Drink," and "We Might
Not Win—But We're Not All Wet!"
Branner. however, sprang the sur
prise of the evening—one vote for
the Chappie's Old Boy, as against 83
for Dewey and 41 for Roosevelt. How
did Gugel sneak into Branner?
