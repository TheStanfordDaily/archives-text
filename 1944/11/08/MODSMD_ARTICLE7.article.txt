# Will You Give Band Players Lift to Game?
## 
### 
Seventy band members are with
out transportation to the Cal-USC
football game, 2:30 p.m., November
18. As 60 of these musicians are
army students, they do not get out
of classes until 11 a.m. Saturday and
hence cannot get train or bus accom
modations.
"I issue an appeal to all you loyal
and patriotic Stanford students to
support school spirit and traditions
and lend the aid of space in your
cars." Jim Emerson, ticket sales
chairman, said yesterday. Students
answering this call may telephone
the ASSU office, 8201, or Emerson
at 7490 and give their name, ad
dress, and the number they will be
able to take in their car.
It is essential that the band be at
the game as they will play Stanford
songs and do stunts between halves
and foster pep in general, said
Emerson. Students will not have to
worry about carrying the instru
ments too, as other arrangements
have been made for those.
The remaining tickets for the game
sold out yesterday afternoon, but
more have been sent for and should
arrive in time for sale the first of
next week, Emerson said.
