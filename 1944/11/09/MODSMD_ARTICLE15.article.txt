# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
Election night, was a very important evening
to all the students of the Stanford campus, as
most of the professors and students will testify.
More important to all of us, however, was the
Ex-Corn. meeting of Wednesday, for on that
night, the most august, and dominant members
of our student body grouped together and
voted on the Social Policy of our fair univer
sity.
This great group of liberals have worked day
and night on this momentous decision. They
have been thinking about the social policy while
they were eating, sleeping, bee—owling, in
fact, they have worked so hard on the policy,
that they have become anti-social. To every
one reading this session, I wish to ask that they
give two minutes of silent reverence to the
social policy committee, and then a "BIG SIX".
It is too bad that all these people have worked
so fast in getting the campus social life organ
ized, as I don't know what work they will find
to do for the rest of their term of office. How
ever, the social policy has been a major one
in the university for the last few years, and it
is time for this much-debated issue to come to
a final settlement.
On comparing the new policy with the old
Dne, I really can't find much of a change, but
30 as not to hurt the feelings of this sincere
committee, I think it best if all of us would
}ive a deep low bow to all members of the
social policy committee when meeting them on
he campus.
In reference to the new social policy, the
J)ld Boy" says,"the only workable social pol
-y is, no brew over 3.2."
Dave Davis remarks, "Everyone can expect
t change in policy in 1948."
The Bull Sessioner quotes, "Due to the new
■Micy, the drinkers are stinkers."
1 have been sort of kicking this new policy

around, but seriously, I think all of us should
take a great deal of interest in wfyat it says, as
the new law affects all of us, whether we like it
or not. The best social policy of all, is judged by
common sense, and good breeding. As a Stan
ford student, you should be proud enough of
the university to keep up its good reputation.
To do this, is to respect the student government
which you elected yourself.

around, but seriously, I think all of us should
take a great deal of interest in wfyat it says, as
the new law affects all of us, whether we like it
or not. The best social policy of all, is judged by
common sense, and good breeding. As a Stan
ford student, you should be proud enough of
the university to keep up its good reputation.
To do this, is to respect the student government
which you elected yourself.
Election night, was a very important evening
to all the students of the Stanford campus, as
most of the professors and students will testify.
More important to all of us, however, was the
Ex-Corn. meeting of Wednesday, for on that
night, the most august, and dominant members
of our student body grouped together and
voted on the Social Policy of our fair univer
sity.
This great group of liberals have worked day
and night on this momentous decision. They
have been thinking about the social policy while
they were eating, sleeping, bee—owling, in
fact, they have worked so hard on the policy,
that they have become anti-social. To every
one reading this session, I wish to ask that they
give two minutes of silent reverence to the
social policy committee, and then a "BIG SIX".
It is too bad that all these people have worked
so fast in getting the campus social life organ
ized, as I don't know what work they will find
to do for the rest of their term of office. How
ever, the social policy has been a major one
in the university for the last few years, and it
is time for this much-debated issue to come to
a final settlement.
On comparing the new policy with the old
Dne, I really can't find much of a change, but
30 as not to hurt the feelings of this sincere
committee, I think it best if all of us would
}ive a deep low bow to all members of the
social policy committee when meeting them on
he campus.
In reference to the new social policy, the
J)ld Boy" says,"the only workable social pol
-y is, no brew over 3.2."
Dave Davis remarks, "Everyone can expect
t change in policy in 1948."
The Bull Sessioner quotes, "Due to the new
■Micy, the drinkers are stinkers."
