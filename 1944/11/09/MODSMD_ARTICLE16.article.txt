# OUR HASHER
## 
### JOE SHER 
After a tremendous meal of beans, beans, and
ice cream the Farm students loosed their belts
(I am kidding of course, for I went down to Ye
Old Indian Drive Inn and had three big fat
burgers to keep body and soul together, not
that I didn't get enough to eat) and adjourned
to an evening of dancing and the Shaughnessy
Shambles.
The group danced and danced, purely for the
fun of dancing of course until some Chintz
turned on the lights. However all in all the
event was very successful and all in charge
should be heartily congratulated.
Carry over from Halloween: The hashers at
one of the local living groups opened their gen
erous and flowing hearts, to say nothing of their
pocketbooks and presented each member of the
house with a small token of their % regard and af
fection for the members of the group. This
wonderful and definitely expensive gift was
(everyone hold their breath in anticipation),
no, not the nector of the proletariate but a small
jar of â€”Mum.
Nice to see many of the old school returning ;
in their various uniforms and again taking part !
in Farm activities. Among the returning roughs
were Sailors Norm Schieber, Bob Fess, Russ
Lee, Syl O'Nesti, Dick Clarke, and Stub Harvey.
Soidier Bill Hornby, and Marine Looey Bowman
Lamport.
Bruce Jessup dropped in for an all too short
weekend and disappeared almost immediately.
The return of the lads to the group lends an
encouraging note that soon all will be as before,
keep your fingers crossed girls.
Tremendous wave of numerical symbols |
sweeps campus. All the men on the campus
have devised for themselves a numerical code, j
with which they shout greeting to one another i
and comment on various items of interest which
catch the eye. Leading numbers are 89, 13, 87,
and the newest 99. However some of the little
lasses have discovered some the secrets and J
the alert males are hard pressed to discover new !
codes.
