To the Editor and the Young Democrats:
Throughout the preceding campaign we have
noticed the poor taste the Young Democrats
have used in their choice of political advertise
ments. The height of their ill-conceived humor
was recorded in Wednesday's Daily with the
appearance of cheap vaudeville tactics. The
type of taunting mockery is definitely out of
place and achieves a new high in poor faste
and a new low in sportsmanship.
At a time when the defeated Republican can
didate asked for complete unity, such a remark
is enttirely uncalled for. Let's hope that such
a low ebb will never be reached again in .a
political campaign.
