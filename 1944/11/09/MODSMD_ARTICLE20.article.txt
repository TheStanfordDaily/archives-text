With talk of bowl and post season j
games already taking on a serious '
aspect, it seems that there are very j
few "whales" (those teams which j
have the power to beat their oppo- I
nents ruthlessly whenever they get j
in the mood to commit such an act) i
left in the nation. Army, Navy, Ohio
State, and Notre Dame (only a little I

I "whale" now) lead the field, closely
| followed by Georgia Tech, USC, and
j Michigan. Of these big spouters,
| one of them, either Army or Notre
I Dame, will have to look for new arid
' deeper seas.
For on next Saturday, the Cadets
and the Irish will have it out, and
i the strongest team (we hope) will
I win. Right now, the odds are on
Army and they will probably stay

there. While Army was putting away
Duke and Villanova by considerable
matins (83-0 in the Villanova mas
sacre), Notre Dame was getting its
pants scared off by Illinois and was
beaten miserably by Navy. Doug
Kenna, Glenn Davis and Wreckers,
Inc., upheld the honor of the Cadets
by averaging over a point a minute
and are now rated as the top team in
the nation. However, Army has not
met very powerful teams, with the
exception of Duke. And for that
matter, neither has Notre Dame, ex
cluding their last two games.
