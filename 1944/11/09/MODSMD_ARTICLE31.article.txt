# Mendolowitz Predicts Bright Future for Art
## 
### 
There's a mighty bright post-war picture for Stanford's Graphic Arts
Department, according to Professor Daniel Marcus Mendelowitz, acting
head of the department.
As proof of this, Professor Mendelowitz proudly points to the fact that
enrollment in art courses was seven times larger in 1941 than in 1933.

Using this as a basis, he predicts an '
even greater interest in art after the j
war, for students will be preparing
for professions in architecture, in
dustrial designs, commercial art, fine
art, and, of course, teaching.
Specialtyâ€”Water-color Landscapes
What is Graphic Art? No, says Mr.
Mendelowitz, it's not a branch of
analytical geometry! It's a general
term applied to painting, drawing,
engraving, cartooning, and the many
other closely-related arts.
Don't be surprised, as your re- I
porter was, to find Mr. Mendelowitz
carefully tendering a beautiful cac
tus in preparation for a still life
study. His specialty, though, is
water-color landscapes. Last winter
he held a special exhibition of his
painting on war-time industries.
History of Painting
Providing war-time regulations
permit it, Mr. Mendelowitz plans to
concentrate on painting ocean scenes
on his leave next summer. He and
Professor Edward Farmer, depart
ment head, alternately tcach for six
quarters, and then continue their
own work for two quarters. Pro
fessor Farmer is on leave at present.
In addition to teaching the tech
niques of drawing, Professor Men
delowitz conducts courses on the
history of painting. Lis class in mo
tion pictures attends movies in the
Education Auditorium for the study
of the art contained in them.
Professor Mendelowitz graduated
from Stanford in 1926, and started
his teaching career at San Jose State
College. He has been a member of
the Stanford art department since
1934.
