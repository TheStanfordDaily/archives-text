# WAR FRONTS
## 
### Elliot Epsteen 
The Western front is going into
action again. We seem to be making
a two-pronged drive, one army
thrusting out through Holland aimed
at the flatlands leading to Berlin,
and the other, exploiting the Aachen
breakthrough.
The German commanders are lit
erally on the horns of a dilemma,
because our opening in the north
was due to enemy dispositions, and
now they don't dare risk reinforc
ing their front there because of our
Aachen attack.
General Picture
The fighting around Aachen is of
a bloody nature, but it is probably
the lesser in strategic importance. It
seems to be designed to pin down
the enemy forces in the area, re
ported as considerable, and to take
advantage of the dislocation caused
by Field-Marshal Montgomery's at
tack in the north.
The latter was at least aided by
the thinness of the German salient
connecting their main line with the
gun positions threatening Antwerp.
The troops in this salient were fight
ing with their backs to a river, and
the success of the British drive to
cut them off from the rest of their

I front levered them into a precipitous
! retreat.
Such affairs are always very
bloody, and we now have an op
portunity to take advantage of the
heavy losses inflicted on the enemy
here as well as his undoubted at
tending disorganization to push over
the Maas and the Schelde into Ger
many.
Southern Bombings
Meanwhile Allied bomber fleets
are bombarding the Rhine rail cen
ters feeding the troops in more
southerly sectors of the line. These
strokes are probably being made
with the hope of preventing the Ger
mans from weakening these sector:-
for the benefit of operations to the
north, and to spread out German air--
power.
They might be the prelude for one
large scale offensive all along tht
line, designed to roll the German.-;
back to the Rhine while our extreme
left, in Holland, swerves down be
hind them towards their line of re -
treat.
