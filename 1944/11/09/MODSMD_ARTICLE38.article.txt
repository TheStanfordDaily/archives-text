# Palo Alto Canines Live in Comfort

### JOHN LARSON 
''Have you any dogs for sale? I would like a watchdog to protect our
Victory garden." Typical is this inquiry of the many that are asked daily
of the Palo Alto Animal Shelter. Located near El Camino and University
Avenue, it is often seen by Stanford students; however, few students know
anything of its operation.
The city of Palo Alto can and should he proud of its animal shelter; for

it is one of the most outstanding *
municipally-owned plants for the i
care of animals in the nation. The
wedge-shaped building of white ]
stucco, with red-tiled roof and green !
trim, is of Spanish-type architecture,
and has an attractively landscaped !
setting.
Founding of Plant
Credit for the founding of this j
plant is due to The Palo Alto Hu
mane Society, which had its begin
ning in a meeting of indignant dog
owners and lovers in 1924. The
structure was built in 1937 at the |
cost of $20,000; in it is an up-to-date
complete heating system; modern
kennels which are cleaned daily; j
X-ray equipment and a radiograph;
and all the most recent develop
ments that should be in a modern j
animal shelter; besides large exer- !
cise yards for dogs.
Also in the plant are public re
ceiving kennels for lost or aban- j
doned animals found after hours. [
In addition to numerous dogs and i
cats, there has been found in these ]
kennels a goat, a turtle, and an ar
madillo.
50 Cats Lost Daily
During their busy summer months,
50 lost cats are taken care of every
day by the shelter. Until sold or
claimed, animals are kept in clean, j
modern kennels arid are fed scien- |
tifically balanced food; and before |
rationing that included fresh ground !
beef.
Dogs are sold from $3 up to $15,
and some Great Danes and St. Ber- j
nards are sold for $25. Dogs are not j
.sold until they have been properly
trained nor are they sold to unre- |
Jiable parties who would not give
them proper care.
Shelter Self-Sustaining
"The shelter does not give away
dogs for two reasons," Mrs. Frank
Thomas, superintendent of the shel- j
ler and a director of The Humane ;
Society, commented. "First, because j
the shelter's $10,000 yearly budget
cannot afford it; and secondly be
cause The Humane Society believes !
that people will take more pride in
a dog that they paid for; and if they
were not satisfied with the dog they \
would return it rather than aban- j
don it if it was given to them.
Although the shelter's work is of j
great civic significance, the city pays J
Jor little of the institution's expenses. |
Animal sales, dog licenses, the board- j
ing of animals, and observation cases \
lor the health department are the !
items by which overhead expenses
are paid.

Dogs are sold from $3 up to $15,
and some Great Danes and St. Ber- j
nards are sold for $25. Dogs are not j
.sold until they have been properly
trained nor are they sold to unre- |
Jiable parties who would not give
them proper care.
Shelter Self-Sustaining
"The shelter does not give away
dogs for two reasons," Mrs. Frank
Thomas, superintendent of the shel- j
ler and a director of The Humane ;
Society, commented. "First, because j
the shelter's $10,000 yearly budget
cannot afford it; and secondly be
cause The Humane Society believes !
that people will take more pride in
a dog that they paid for; and if they
were not satisfied with the dog they \
would return it rather than aban- j
don it if it was given to them.
Although the shelter's work is of j
great civic significance, the city pays J
Jor little of the institution's expenses. |
Animal sales, dog licenses, the board- j
ing of animals, and observation cases \
lor the health department are the !
items by which overhead expenses
are paid.
''Have you any dogs for sale? I would like a watchdog to protect our
Victory garden." Typical is this inquiry of the many that are asked daily
of the Palo Alto Animal Shelter. Located near El Camino and University
Avenue, it is often seen by Stanford students; however, few students know
anything of its operation.
The city of Palo Alto can and should he proud of its animal shelter; for

it is one of the most outstanding *
municipally-owned plants for the i
care of animals in the nation. The
wedge-shaped building of white ]
stucco, with red-tiled roof and green !
trim, is of Spanish-type architecture,
and has an attractively landscaped !
setting.
Founding of Plant
Credit for the founding of this j
plant is due to The Palo Alto Hu
mane Society, which had its begin
ning in a meeting of indignant dog
owners and lovers in 1924. The
structure was built in 1937 at the |
cost of $20,000; in it is an up-to-date
complete heating system; modern
kennels which are cleaned daily; j
X-ray equipment and a radiograph;
and all the most recent develop
ments that should be in a modern j
animal shelter; besides large exer- !
cise yards for dogs.
Also in the plant are public re
ceiving kennels for lost or aban- j
doned animals found after hours. [
In addition to numerous dogs and i
cats, there has been found in these ]
kennels a goat, a turtle, and an ar
madillo.
50 Cats Lost Daily
During their busy summer months,
50 lost cats are taken care of every
day by the shelter. Until sold or
claimed, animals are kept in clean, j
modern kennels arid are fed scien- |
tifically balanced food; and before |
rationing that included fresh ground !
beef.
