# 'Imperialism'-- Brand's Topic
## 
### 
Dr. Carl Fremont Brand will speak
Friday to the Commonwealth Club
of California on the subject of "Brit
ish Imperialism." He will stress the
political trends in the Empire, and
the position of the dominions.
Dr. Brand will trace the rise of
the dominions from colonial status
to that of independent nations, show
ing the reality of this independence.
Canada, in particular, has set the
pace in this evolution, and Ameri
cans should realize the importance
of studying this "good neighbor" to
the north as well as those to the
south.
India—Free?
Contrary to popular belief, much
has been done to start India on the
road to independence. In reality,
England has made just as good an
offer to India as we have to the
Philippines.
Dr. Brand will also discuss the
more backward colonies of the de
pendent Empire and some of the
principles that have been applied to
their government. In many cases
parliaments, on the order of Eng
land's, have been extended to them.
Indirect rule, however, is being tried
in Nigeria and other places in South
Africa where the native institutions
are being preserved and used as
foundations for future development.
The present century has seen re
sults that give great promise for the
future along this line.

Dr. Brand hopes that an under
standing of these essential facts
might facilitate international under
standing and do something to re
move the suspicion of the British
Empire that is never far under the
surface in this ,country.
