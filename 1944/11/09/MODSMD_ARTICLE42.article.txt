# Postwar Plans---Holsti

"America must lead in postwar
organization," stressed Dr. Rudolf
Holsti, acting professor of political
science and former Finnish delegate
to the League of Nations. "The
United States enjoys greater confi
dence of the civilized nations than
any other great power.
"Europe today is exhausted, men
tally and physically; its nerves have
been subjected to tremendous pres
sure. America can provide fresh,
unbiased leadership, and can back it
up with tremendous financial, eco
nomic, industrial, and agricultural
resources.
"I am all the more certain of this
because of what happened just be
fore the outbreak of war. All of the
diplomats accredited to the League
of Nations called on me as their
dean just before they left Geneva.
Unanimously they asked me to de
liver this message to the United
Stales, that only America can save
the civilization. I was the last diplo
mat to leave Geneva, and today I am
more tha never convinced that their
prophecy was true."
"I am not prepared to state defi
nitely what I think the new world
organization will be," he continued,
"for I have had little contact with
Europe for four years. But there are
several features it must have to be
successful, as proved by the League
of Nations.
Strong Executive Power
"First, the new organization must
have full power to act immediately
lor peace, by calling on each coun
try for troops. In the League of
Nations, only the financial and eco
nomic sanctions were obligatory,
whereas military sanctions were op
tional. The experience of the League
in applying these sanctions against
Italy in 1935 and 1936 proved that
the first two sanctions arc ineffec
tive alone, even against a secondary
power. Therefore, I think, the mili
tary sanctions must predominate in
the new organization.
"Second, the requirement of a ma
jority vote will be better than a
unanimous one, because it is almost
impossible for nations to agree
unanimoiiSly on any issue.
"Third, I hope that the post-war
organization will be universal, com
prising all states. Here again, the
United States must lead, for it was
her absence together with that of
several other great powers that
formed one of the greatest handi
caps in the League of Nations.
Permanent Government
"Fourth, but not least important,
we should have a permanent world
government, rather than a Council
which meets only four or five times
annually. I am afraid this reform
will not be carried through imme
diately, but hope that the nations

will eventually recognize its neces
sity.
"The outline adopted by the Dum
barton Oaks Conference has been a
good start, but not until the next
United Nations Conference will we
know more definitely what the new
world organization will be.
"The chief obstacle in the way of
an effective world organization is a
clause in the Atlantic Charter which
says that parties in an international
dispute will be allowed to vote.
This is undoubtedly one of the first
problems that will be discussed at
the next meeting of the United Na
tions, but the solution will be diffi
cult.
I Economic Plans Good
"It is the United Nations' careful
| plans for economic co-operation that
I will give the best guarantees of suc-
J cess to the new government. These
I plans concerning production and
: distribution of food, international
banking, and similar problems were
first embodied in the Atlantic Char
ter, and later in the Bretton Woods
Plan."
Dr. Holsti did not feel qualified
to discuss the latter in detail, but
he did feel that it was excellent.
One of the weaknesses of the League
was that it had no such plan for eco
! nomic colaboration.
Co-operation Begun
One of the best examples of such
| co-operation for the present needs
! of war-torn countries is the United
! Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
I Association, which is already func
tioning, and will probably continue
for some time after the war. It is
| doing on an enlarged scale just such
work as Herbert Hoover did during
| the last war.
Dr. Holsti was particularly enthu
siastic about such an association, re
calling the results of Mr. Hoover's
i work. It was, United States help in
I restoring victim nations to inde
pendence and prosperity that built
up such a great reservoir of good
l will for us. And now we have an
| other chance to lead with our tre
mendous resources.
He preferred not to express an
opinion on how to deal with Japan
I after this war, because he knows
i little of that country. But he did
[ believe she should be watched as
potentially dangerous.
Military Occupation
About Germany he was more defi
! nite. He has never trusted her
military clique. She resembles the
United Nations more than Japan,
i but might remain more dangerous
j in the bottom of her heart. Military
occupation should be made very ef
fective, he feels. The experiment
j made during the last war was a
I failure because it did not make a

lasting impression. Both economic
and political aid should be limited
to the kind that will not enable her
to rearm.
Dr. Holsti predicts that the chief
source oi' irritation between the
great powers will be the practical
interpretation of the engagements
they have signed. But leading
statesmen have continually stressed
the importance of co-operation, and
he hopes that they will carry this
policy through the future.
