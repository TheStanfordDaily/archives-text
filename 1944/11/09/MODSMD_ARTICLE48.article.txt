A visdt to the campus homo of
Doris Gates Hall, author of several
children's books and literary con
sultant for a series of basic readers

In speaking of her "hobby," which
has now become her business, the
author said modestly, "Anyone with !
an idea and enough perseverance can
write at least one publishable book." j
As a background for writing chil- 1
dren's fiction, Mrs. Hall was libra- J
rian in the children's department of
the Fresno County Library, which
is the second of its kind in the coun
try, circulating about (500.000 chil
dren's books a year.
On her tours of the migrant schools j
of the San Joaquin Valley, Mrs. Hall
also made pleasant contacts with I
countless young students, whom she
entertained with her memory of
fairy tales and animal stories. An i
earlier work "Blue Willow," to- i
gel her with Steinbeck's "Grapes of j
Wrath." both published by Viking,
were the first books to be written on
the migrants.

joys brousing in the main library. j

lectures, and "wouldn't think of !
missing a Kit Carson episode."

Stanford family, Mrs. Hall simply j
cannot pass by the P.O. without dust

to explain to those who saw her ap
parently "down on her knees lost in
prayer" a few weeks ago, that she !
was just trying to work that im- |
possible combination.
