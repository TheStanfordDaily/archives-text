# Excom Passes Revamped Social Policy
## 
### 
Excom last night approved a re
vision of the social code, upon the
recommendation of the Committees
on Social Policy whose membership
included Courtaney Pen-en, Dick
Jobe, J. D. Williams, and the A.S.S.U.
officers. Barbara White, A.S.S.U.
president, released the following
statement concerning the policy:
"Tlie policy is in the form of two
by-laws to be added to the Consti
tution, and is a combination of con
stitutional by-laws as formulated in
1942 and the wartime social policy
as passed in '41 and reindorsed each
year until social code was passed
in spring 1944.
"Other than changes in the word
ing for clarification and an addition
to fit circumstances this year, only
two changes in the Constitution have
been made. Under it, an organization
could hold one off-campus function
a year. In 1942 'in the interest of
safety, good taste, and expense,' stu
dent functions were restricted to
those on campus. The war and the
reason for this change continues, so
the policy is reindorsed but excep
tions may have to be considered.
Art. 1, Sec. 2a.)
"The second addition is the state
ment relating to use of liquor in
public places by minors. With so
many more students under 21 than
ordinarily at Stanford, it seems logi
cal that their student government
encourage the observance of state
liquor regulations. (Art. 1, See. 3b.)
"Though regulations are necessary
to ensure some measure of control
by students over their social activi
ties, the real basis of the social pol
icy is the Fundamental Standard
wherein it is the individual respon
sibility of each student himself or

herself to act as becomes a good |
citizen.
"These by-laws, having been ap
proved by the Executive Committee, |
will go into effect one week follow- j
ing the date of their approval as pre
scribed by the Constitution."
ARTICLE I. TIIE FUNDAMENTAL
STANDARD
a. Students are expected to show ;
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, mo- 1
rality, personal honor, and the i
rights of others, as is demanded of i
good citizens. Failure to do this
will be sufficient cause for removal ;
from the University.
b. A spirit of equality must be
maintained within the University, i
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities 1
in prohibition of excessive expend
itures and other excesses on the
part of students, and the formation
or growth of any organization, cus
tom, or social function, that tends I
to the development of exclusive or
undemocratic castes within the J
University, and to exclude from
the institution any one whose con- I
duct is inconsistent with the spirit J
of the Founders.
c. All cases of conduct unbe- |
coming a Stanford student are sub- I
ject to the disciplinary action ol j
the appropriate Council for Stu- j
dent Control.
Section 1. The Honor Code
a. The Honor Code is an under
taking of the students, individually i
and collectively, that they will not j
give or receive aid in examina- 1
tions; that they will not give or re- i
ceive unpermitted aid in class j
work, in the preparation of reports,
or in any other work that is to be

used as the basis of grading; that
they will not violate the rules of
the library by taking without per
mission from the library, or by in
juring any book, pamphlet, or other
document belonging to its collec
tion; and that they will do their
share and take an active part, in
seeing to it that others as well as
themselves obey the spirit and the
letter of the Honor Code. The Uni
versity on its part manifests its
confidence in the honor of its stu
dents by refraining from proctor
ing examinations, or otherwise tak
ing special steps to prevent the
forms of dishonesty mentioned
above.
b. Infractions of the honor sys
tem shall be dealt with by the ap
propriate Council for Student Con
trol.
Section 2. Business Integrity
Business integrity shall be re
quired in the fulfillment of agree
ments and in the prompt payment
of bills by individuals, by classes,
and by all student organizations.
Any willful abuse of the common
practices relating to business in
tegrity shall be dealt with by the
appropriate Council for Student
Control.
a. The possession, transportation,
or use of intoxicating liquors by
Stanford students on the campus
shall be grounds for expulsion from
the University.
b. The vise in public places of
intoxicating liquors by students
who are minors is contrary to the
policy of the Associated Students.
