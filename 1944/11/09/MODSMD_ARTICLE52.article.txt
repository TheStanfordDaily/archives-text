"The 45th Anniversary Chaparral, j
out tomorrow, will feature material ,
by such celebrities as H. Allen Smith, j
author of "Low Man on a Totem
Pole," "Doodles" Weaver, Feg Mur- j
ray, creator of "Seein' Stars," and I
Otto Soglow. These people sent stuff
in especially for Chappie's 45th birth
day."
So stated the famed Monroe
"Mole," president of the Monroe
"Coke and Bridge Club." The Mole
added, 'The Old Boy told me that i
H. Allen Smith's "Laundered in
Lunacy" is one the funniest stories
he ever read. I'm going to buy a
whole mess of Chappies tomorrow."

! Old Boy, Barney Gugel, and Biz
: Manager Bill Gilbert told your re
! porter about nine red hot cartoons
J by former Chappie Art Editor, Pfc.
j F. Q. Hewitt, and two by another
I former Art Editor, Capt. Bob Rie-
I ser. "These 11 cartoons are real
I schnazzy," they said.
"The mag is chuck full of bon mots
and jokes which nobody has ever
seen before. There's a letter by
Jimmy Mulkahy, an unknown Holly
wood plumber; a letter by Dave
Davis, newspaper man; two pages of
j Now Thats; five peach stories: nine
beautiful pages of cartoons; includ
ing 30 brand new hot off the pen
cartoons and 16 reprints of the 0.8.'s
favorite old Chappie cartoons; there's

two beautiful queens; and piles of
ads if your taste runs toward that
sort of thing," quipped the Old Boy,
gasping or breath.
Gilbert and Managing Eflitor, Dick
Fay ram, reminded your reporter that
everybody should buy extra copies ;
of the super dooper 40-page Chappie
to send to friends and relatives in j
the service.
"You don't have to worry about
not getting your copies, because j
when it comes to Chappies, we got (
piles," they said.
The interview closed when the Old |
Boy leaped out of the winifcw on to I
the roof of the Daily Shack, scream- 1
ing ."The Chappie's the nuts. It's the
nuts I tell you. 25 cents—2s cents— j
It's the nuts —25 cents, chip at hef da
price."
