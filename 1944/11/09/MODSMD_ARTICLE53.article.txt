# Army Crowds Dancing Class
## 
### TED DRENTON 
Army boys are crowding into Miss
Maria Rael's Thursday evening danc
ing classes. 35 couples are attending
at present, in addition to a few stags
who keep the group mixing.
The classes meet from 9:30 to
10:15 tonight and every other Thurs
day night. According to Miss Rael,
director, the Army boys are very
anxious to learn and are most co
operative and courteous.
The girls make capable instructors,
for they are proficient in all the lat
est dance steps as well as the more

KJ
l old-fashioned ones. Basic steps in
i eluding the pivot turn, the fox trot.
and the canter walk are not too dif
; ficult, and the boys are rapidly
mastering them.
Later in the year more complex
I steps like the Samba, Rhumba, and
Tango will be taught when the boys
have mastered the basic ones.
"The lessons will continue for the
I remained of the year and very likely
attendance will increase as the ad
j vanced steps are taken up," Miss
Rael states.
Civilians are also invited to at
tend each weekly lesson.
