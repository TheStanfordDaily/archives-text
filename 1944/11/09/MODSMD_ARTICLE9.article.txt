# CAMPUS MEN PLAN SMOKER
## 
### 
All Stanford men—new and old—will disturb the sacrosanct
atmosphere of the Women's Clubhouse tomorrow night for a
genuine, rowdy Farm "Smoker." This Smoker has a twist—
committeemen are offering luscious Stanford women for dancing
in addition to an evening full of gags, campus personalities, pre
view scenes of the '44 Gaieties, and all kinds of refreshments.
The Big Move by the men at the Clubhouse will take place
at 7 o'clock; the meeting will get under way at that time with
short talks from such prominent and popular members of the
: faculty as Dr. Thomas Barclay and Dr. Jan Popper. Songs and
yells led. by Ric Supple will introduce student personalities who
: will describe campus activities of interest to men.
About that time the hostesses from the Chalet, Parnie Storey
House, and Casa Eucalypto will step forward to exhibit other
features of interest to Stanford men. Dancing, food, and all
around hubba-hubba will continue until 11 p.m.
The Smoker is presented by the Student Relations Committee,
a group formed by Excom to orient new and old men students
in campus affairs and activity. This is the first effort of the
committee, but in view of the entertainment to be given and
the number of men who have already shown interest in the
Smoker, it will be the first of a long series of programs.
