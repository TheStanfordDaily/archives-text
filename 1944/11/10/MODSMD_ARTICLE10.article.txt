# Stanford Players Present Comedy; Capacity Crowds View 'Dover Road'
## 
### DICK BOWER 
A. A. Milne's English comedy, '"The
Dover Road," was premiered to a
capacity house Wednesday evening
in the Little Theater of the Memo
rial Auditorium.
What action there is revolves
around the eccentric Mr. Latimer,
ably characterized by John High.
Latimer waylays eloping couples in
his rambling house and forces them
to spend a few days together before
their marriage.
The first curtain finds Latimer
greeting one such couple, Anne
(Ha/el Spore) and Leonard (Newton
Arnold. Leonard rebels at Latimer's
"treatment" and blusters that he de
serves better treatment. Latimer's
explanation of his queer hobby
while eating a hearty dinner is-out
standing.

1 Second Act
In the crucial second act we learn
that Leonard's first wife. Eustasia.
is also in the house with her pres
ent suitor, Nicholas, who is rather
bitter at life in general and love in
particular. Latimer and his impec
cable man-servant, Dominic, derive
much amusement from this enlarged
"eternal triangle" but the stub-hold
ers out front, sorry to say, don't get
the same result.
The final episode reveals three of
the four participants in Latimer's
house party sneaking out the front
door while the coquettish Eustasia,
finds herself a new male companion.
High Is Clever
"The Dover Road's" first act shows
promise but the second and third
stanzas bog down due to poor dia
logue. John High, turning in a clever

your plaudits, and Sally Stocker, as
ment in capable fashion.
F. Cowles Strickland's direction is
adequate and technical work is com
petently handled. First night jitters
were at a minimum Wednesday and
no prompting was noticed. Special
mention should be made of the pic
turesque costumes worn by Mr. High
and his numerous seravnts.
Trite Story
Elame for the dubious success of
"The Dover Road" must be placed
upon the rather trite and inconse
quential story involved, and not upon
the individual performances of the
cast.
The Stanford Players will present
"Hie Dover Road" Friday. Satur
day, and Monday nights. Curtain is
at 8:13.

that Leonard's first wife. Eustasia.
is also in the house with her pres
ent suitor, Nicholas, who is rather
bitter at life in general and love in
particular. Latimer and his impec
cable man-servant, Dominic, derive
much amusement from this enlarged
"eternal triangle" but the stub-hold
ers out front, sorry to say, don't get
the same result.
The final episode reveals three of
the four participants in Latimer's
house party sneaking out the front
door while the coquettish Eustasia,
finds herself a new male companion.
High Is Clever
"The Dover Road's" first act shows
promise but the second and third
stanzas bog down due to poor dia
logue. John High, turning in a clever

your plaudits, and Sally Stocker, as
ment in capable fashion.
F. Cowles Strickland's direction is
adequate and technical work is com
petently handled. First night jitters
were at a minimum Wednesday and
no prompting was noticed. Special
mention should be made of the pic
turesque costumes worn by Mr. High
and his numerous seravnts.
Trite Story
Elame for the dubious success of
"The Dover Road" must be placed
upon the rather trite and inconse
quential story involved, and not upon
the individual performances of the
cast.
The Stanford Players will present
"Hie Dover Road" Friday. Satur
day, and Monday nights. Curtain is
at 8:13.
A. A. Milne's English comedy, '"The
Dover Road," was premiered to a
capacity house Wednesday evening
in the Little Theater of the Memo
rial Auditorium.
What action there is revolves
around the eccentric Mr. Latimer,
ably characterized by John High.
Latimer waylays eloping couples in
his rambling house and forces them
to spend a few days together before
their marriage.
The first curtain finds Latimer
greeting one such couple, Anne
(Ha/el Spore) and Leonard (Newton
Arnold. Leonard rebels at Latimer's
"treatment" and blusters that he de
serves better treatment. Latimer's
explanation of his queer hobby
while eating a hearty dinner is-out
standing.
