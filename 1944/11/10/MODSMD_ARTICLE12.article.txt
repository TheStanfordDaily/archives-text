# OUR HASHER
## 
### JOE SHER 
With the coming of winter, and if you don't
believe that it is here, take a row or a swim
down Lasuen or any other street on campus
and convince yourself, the big social event of
December, the "Snow Ball," has been planned
to actually inaugurate a Snow King and his
court.
The election of the Snow King and the six
teen beautiful princesses as his court will be
the highlight of the ball. Every women's living
group will select its most beautiful member to
be in the court and the men will put forth their,
most handsome men. The problem of sixteen
beautiful girls will probably be tough but the
abundance of good-looking males will make
the selection of a handsome king no problem
whatsoever.
Your hasher will nominate prominent males
about the campus who he feels will make suit
able candidates. This will merely supplement
the men nominated from the various dorms.
The two BMOC's are, first, Dick (the Long
Barn Lothario) Crane, prominent humorist (ask
Miss Rush and the economics department) and
author of the Dull Session, which is widely read
by his mother and father and others (the rest of
his relatives).
The second candidate is P. (the Phantom)
Quincy Brown, well-known campus personality
and reeber. Mr. Brown would feel completely
at home surrounded by sixteen beautiful girls
and has the physical makeup to be a tremen
dous (I did not say that he was gaining weight)
King. As soon as I get out of the hospital I
will make further nominations.
Plans are now in the process of fermentation
(the process that makes celery reeb) for a gi
gantic rally the week of the Cal vs. U.S.C. game.
A big bonfire, rally in the pavilion, card stunt
practice, and all the other activities which go
to make up the excitement of a game week-end.
A terrific set of card stunts have been planned
by the rally committee and if you cannot tell
red from green have your eyes checked or else
all you might see is black and blue as irate
Indians beat you soundly about the head and
shoulders, thanks brooks.

The age-old ruse of the Stanford males, the
Fireside, has come to the fore this week-end.
Practically every house on campus has insidi
ously laid its plans for the chase. Stocks of
wood have been put up, popcorn has been
purchased, various foods and beverages have
been prepared, lights have been taken out of
■jockets (the old one about the storm blew out
.ill of the fuses will get a big work-out here)
md the harassed resident assistants safely
rundled off to the nearest asylum.
This is an old story to the Stanford male and
ne that never fails. Now that this black pic
ire has been painted the women will be more
>uxious than ever to go and do, girls, for they
a lot of fun for the men.
''anking with the rack the iron bcot

and other instruments of medieval torture, the
buzzer, which summons hashers to clear, bring
more milk or any other little items which the
hostess feels are necessary, is an invention that
will go down in infamy.
A happy hasher who has just settled down to
eat a bite of food, hasn't eaten since his last
meal, a happy smile crosses his face as he lifts
his fork which is covered with a succulent mor
sel, when there is a buzzing sound like an irate
bee and the hasher jumps about a foot and a
half as food tlies in all directions, propelled by
his unguided work. The head hasher jumps to
his feet and pulls out his blacksnake whip, all
the while suggesting that someone go out to
answer the bell, all the time looking at you.
The hasher jumps wearily to his feet, muttering
sweet nothings to himself, and trudges through
the swinging doors (this is not a saloon) and
tears out to answer the bell, gulping the food he
has in his mouth so the house mother will think
that he has nothing in his mouth, which he
hasn't. This is in no way conducive to digestion
as many hashers die at an early age (80 or 90)
from chronic ulcers. The (the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Hashers) has
taken a hand and the lean and underfed hash
ers soon hope to have better conditions.

a lot of fun for the men.
''anking with the rack the iron bcot

A happy hasher who has just settled down to
eat a bite of food, hasn't eaten since his last

his fork which is covered with a succulent mor

bee and the hasher jumps about a foot and a
half as food tlies in all directions, propelled by
his unguided work. The head hasher jumps to
his feet and pulls out his blacksnake whip, all
the while suggesting that someone go out to
answer the bell, all the time looking at you.
The hasher jumps wearily to his feet, muttering
sweet nothings to himself, and trudges through
the swinging doors (this is not a saloon) and
tears out to answer the bell, gulping the food he
has in his mouth so the house mother will think
that he has nothing in his mouth, which he
hasn't. This is in no way conducive to digestion
as many hashers die at an early age (80 or 90)
from chronic ulcers. The (the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Hashers) has
taken a hand and the lean and underfed hash

With the coming of winter, and if you don't
believe that it is here, take a row or a swim
down Lasuen or any other street on campus
and convince yourself, the big social event of
December, the "Snow Ball," has been planned
to actually inaugurate a Snow King and his
court.
The election of the Snow King and the six
teen beautiful princesses as his court will be
the highlight of the ball. Every women's living
group will select its most beautiful member to
be in the court and the men will put forth their,
most handsome men. The problem of sixteen
beautiful girls will probably be tough but the
abundance of good-looking males will make
the selection of a handsome king no problem
whatsoever.
Your hasher will nominate prominent males
about the campus who he feels will make suit
able candidates. This will merely supplement
the men nominated from the various dorms.
The two BMOC's are, first, Dick (the Long
Barn Lothario) Crane, prominent humorist (ask
Miss Rush and the economics department) and
author of the Dull Session, which is widely read
by his mother and father and others (the rest of
his relatives).
The second candidate is P. (the Phantom)
Quincy Brown, well-known campus personality
and reeber. Mr. Brown would feel completely
at home surrounded by sixteen beautiful girls
and has the physical makeup to be a tremen
dous (I did not say that he was gaining weight)
King. As soon as I get out of the hospital I
will make further nominations.
Plans are now in the process of fermentation
(the process that makes celery reeb) for a gi
gantic rally the week of the Cal vs. U.S.C. game.
A big bonfire, rally in the pavilion, card stunt
practice, and all the other activities which go
to make up the excitement of a game week-end.
A terrific set of card stunts have been planned
by the rally committee and if you cannot tell
red from green have your eyes checked or else

whatsoever.
Your hasher will nominate prominent males
about the campus who he feels will make suit
able candidates. This will merely supplement
the men nominated from the various dorms.
The two BMOC's are, first, Dick (the Long
Barn Lothario) Crane, prominent humorist (ask
Miss Rush and the economics department) and
author of the Dull Session, which is widely read
by his mother and father and others (the rest of
his relatives).
The second candidate is P. (the Phantom)
Quincy Brown, well-known campus personality
and reeber. Mr. Brown would feel completely
at home surrounded by sixteen beautiful girls
and has the physical makeup to be a tremen
dous (I did not say that he was gaining weight)
King. As soon as I get out of the hospital I
will make further nominations.
Plans are now in the process of fermentation
(the process that makes celery reeb) for a gi
gantic rally the week of the Cal vs. U.S.C. game.
A big bonfire, rally in the pavilion, card stunt
practice, and all the other activities which go
to make up the excitement of a game week-end.
A terrific set of card stunts have been planned
by the rally committee and if you cannot tell
red from green have your eyes checked or else
all you might see is black and blue as irate
Indians beat you soundly about the head and
shoulders, thanks brooks.

The age-old ruse of the Stanford males, the
Fireside, has come to the fore this week-end.
Practically every house on campus has insidi
ously laid its plans for the chase. Stocks of
wood have been put up, popcorn has been
purchased, various foods and beverages have
been prepared, lights have been taken out of
■jockets (the old one about the storm blew out
.ill of the fuses will get a big work-out here)
md the harassed resident assistants safely
rundled off to the nearest asylum.
This is an old story to the Stanford male and
ne that never fails. Now that this black pic
ire has been painted the women will be more
>uxious than ever to go and do, girls, for they
a lot of fun for the men.
''anking with the rack the iron bcot

and other instruments of medieval torture, the
buzzer, which summons hashers to clear, bring
more milk or any other little items which the
hostess feels are necessary, is an invention that
will go down in infamy.
A happy hasher who has just settled down to
eat a bite of food, hasn't eaten since his last
meal, a happy smile crosses his face as he lifts
his fork which is covered with a succulent mor
sel, when there is a buzzing sound like an irate
bee and the hasher jumps about a foot and a
half as food tlies in all directions, propelled by
his unguided work. The head hasher jumps to
his feet and pulls out his blacksnake whip, all
the while suggesting that someone go out to
answer the bell, all the time looking at you.
The hasher jumps wearily to his feet, muttering
sweet nothings to himself, and trudges through
the swinging doors (this is not a saloon) and
tears out to answer the bell, gulping the food he
has in his mouth so the house mother will think
that he has nothing in his mouth, which he
hasn't. This is in no way conducive to digestion
as many hashers die at an early age (80 or 90)
from chronic ulcers. The (the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Hashers) has
taken a hand and the lean and underfed hash
ers soon hope to have better conditions.
With the coming of winter, and if you don't
believe that it is here, take a row or a swim
down Lasuen or any other street on campus
and convince yourself, the big social event of
December, the "Snow Ball," has been planned
to actually inaugurate a Snow King and his
court.
The election of the Snow King and the six
teen beautiful princesses as his court will be
the highlight of the ball. Every women's living
group will select its most beautiful member to
be in the court and the men will put forth their,
most handsome men. The problem of sixteen
beautiful girls will probably be tough but the
abundance of good-looking males will make
the selection of a handsome king no problem
whatsoever.
