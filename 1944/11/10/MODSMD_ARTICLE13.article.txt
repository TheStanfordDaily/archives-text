In yesterday's Daily, there was a news story
on the Student Relations Committee's "Smok
er," which is to be held tonight at "8 o'clock"
in the Women's Clubhouse. (Columnist's note:
This is a correction as to the starting time given
in yesterday's paper. I repeat, the affair starts
at 8 o'clock, not at seven.) This type of event
is the first of its kind since the war started, and
the committee is doing everything possible to
make it a huge success.
Probably the most extraordinary thing about
this smoker is the fact that, from eight to nine,
only MEN will be present. On this campus,
and in these times, only an "act of God" or a
"smoker" could accomplish such a feat. Of
course, to attract the more Freudian members
of the male students, there will be girls from
the "Row," and from other campus living
groups, to help make the atmosphere more
congenial. It is hoped, however, that everyone
attending will pent up their emotions until at
least nine o'clock, and enjoy the program of
speakers, which will include such famous
personalities as Dr. Thomas Barclay of the po
litical science department, John Bunn, Dean of
Men, and Dr. Jan Popper of the music depart
ment. The cast of campus "characters" will be
headed by Miss Barbara Upshaw, vice-presi
dent of A.S.S.U.—only woman involved, due
to campus politics—Dick Driscoll, former presi
dent of A.S.S.U., Hayes Hunter, editor of the
Quad, Dave Davis, editor of the Stanford Daily,
Ric Supple, of "Kappa-Dee-Gee Hasher" fame,
and last but not least, it is rumored that Joe
Sher will try to crawl under the door.
The best that the University has to offer in
the line of co-eds will be there at nine o'clock
to entertain with the dancing and "how are
ya" program that will follow the talks. It has
been said that all women coming will receive
points for war work for doing this, but I can't
see the connection, can you? I really don't
think the affair will be that rough.
The chef of the "Cellar" has worked many
long weeks preparing the menu of refresh
ments to be served, and he says,"It is the best
food ever to come from the 'Cellar'—cider and
doughnuts."
The real purpose behind this smoker is to !
"drum up" interest in all student activities at
Stanford, and to help all new students get
acquainted with some of our curious ways.
This affair, however, is open to all students, old
and new, so I say to all Stanford men, Let's
have a huge crowd turn out, and thank the
committee which is putting this 'smoker' on
in the only possible way to do it.

litical science department, John Bunn, Dean of
Men, and Dr. Jan Popper of the music depart
ment. The cast of campus "characters" will be
headed by Miss Barbara Upshaw, vice-presi
dent of A.S.S.U.—only woman involved, due
to campus politics—Dick Driscoll, former presi
dent of A.S.S.U., Hayes Hunter, editor of the
Quad, Dave Davis, editor of the Stanford Daily,
Ric Supple, of "Kappa-Dee-Gee Hasher" fame,
and last but not least, it is rumored that Joe
Sher will try to crawl under the door.
The best that the University has to offer in
the line of co-eds will be there at nine o'clock
to entertain with the dancing and "how are
ya" program that will follow the talks. It has
been said that all women coming will receive
points for war work for doing this, but I can't
see the connection, can you? I really don't
think the affair will be that rough.
The chef of the "Cellar" has worked many
long weeks preparing the menu of refresh
ments to be served, and he says,"It is the best
food ever to come from the 'Cellar'—cider and
doughnuts."
The real purpose behind this smoker is to !
"drum up" interest in all student activities at
Stanford, and to help all new students get
acquainted with some of our curious ways.
This affair, however, is open to all students, old
and new, so I say to all Stanford men, Let's
have a huge crowd turn out, and thank the
committee which is putting this 'smoker' on
in the only possible way to do it.
In yesterday's Daily, there was a news story
on the Student Relations Committee's "Smok
er," which is to be held tonight at "8 o'clock"
in the Women's Clubhouse. (Columnist's note:
This is a correction as to the starting time given
in yesterday's paper. I repeat, the affair starts
at 8 o'clock, not at seven.) This type of event
is the first of its kind since the war started, and
the committee is doing everything possible to
make it a huge success.
Probably the most extraordinary thing about
this smoker is the fact that, from eight to nine,
only MEN will be present. On this campus,
and in these times, only an "act of God" or a
"smoker" could accomplish such a feat. Of
course, to attract the more Freudian members
of the male students, there will be girls from
the "Row," and from other campus living
groups, to help make the atmosphere more
congenial. It is hoped, however, that everyone
attending will pent up their emotions until at
least nine o'clock, and enjoy the program of
speakers, which will include such famous
personalities as Dr. Thomas Barclay of the po
litical science department, John Bunn, Dean of
Men, and Dr. Jan Popper of the music depart
