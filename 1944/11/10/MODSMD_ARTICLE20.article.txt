# Ram's Head Productions Successful for 33 Years
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
Origin of the title, "Ram's Head," is obscured by time, but the only cam
pus honorary dramatic society has been well known on and off for its
productions since ICII. In the fall Ram's Head gives the Gaieties, formerly
3ig Game Gaieties, with original material and all-campus talent. Three

one-act plays are produced later in
the season and the big Spring Show
is directed by Ram's Head. The
Spring Show is usually a musical
comedy or variety show.
"Rambling Rameses"
One of the big dramatic years at
Stanford was 1913 when Ram's Head
produced "Rambling Rameses," a
musical comedy in which men took
women's parts for the first time. One
player did so well as leading lady
that he was heckled for the re
mainder of his college life.
Organization
Not the first campus di-amatic
group, Ram's Head was preceded
by Sword and Sandals, strictly male,
in 1893, and Masquers, strictly femi
nine, in 1908. Barnstormers, organ
ized as a road show to tour the
state, formerly gave the Spring Show
and the one-act plays. In 1937 the
four groups united under the title
Stagers and two years later changed
it to Ram's Head.
Famous Members
Some Farm graduates and Ram's
Head alumni who have gained rec
ognition in the dramatic field are
Maxwell Anderson, Eleanor Gates,
Glenn Hughes, Geoffrey Morgan,
Florence Ryerson. Motion picture
script writers are Laird Doyle, Ray
Harris, Thomas Seller, Annalee
Whitmar, and Waldemar Young.
Membership in Ram's Head is
gained by points awarded for par
ticipation in one of the group's pro
ductions. Points are given by the
director to the cast, the technical
director to the stage crew, and by
the dancing director to the dance cast
on the basis of the positions held.
Fifteen points are required for ac
tive membership. Army men who
act in one production are given an
honorary status if their efforts merit
it.
At present Ram's Head has thirty
members. Corky Wollman is presi
dent; Janice Shaughnessy, vice-pres
ident; Lois Williams, secretary-treas
urer; Margaret Morgan, point secre
tary.

"Rambling Rameses"
One of the big dramatic years at
Stanford was 1913 when Ram's Head
produced "Rambling Rameses," a
musical comedy in which men took
women's parts for the first time. One
player did so well as leading lady
that he was heckled for the re
mainder of his college life.
Organization
Not the first campus di-amatic
group, Ram's Head was preceded
by Sword and Sandals, strictly male,
in 1893, and Masquers, strictly femi
nine, in 1908. Barnstormers, organ
ized as a road show to tour the
state, formerly gave the Spring Show
and the one-act plays. In 1937 the
four groups united under the title
Stagers and two years later changed
it to Ram's Head.
Famous Members
Some Farm graduates and Ram's
Head alumni who have gained rec
ognition in the dramatic field are
Maxwell Anderson, Eleanor Gates,
Glenn Hughes, Geoffrey Morgan,
Florence Ryerson. Motion picture

Harris, Thomas Seller, Annalee
