Dr. and Mrs. Max Savelle, Miss Pat
Davidson, and Mrs. Thomas will be
the patrons of the evening.
Refreshments will be cider and
fancy doughnuts and will be served
throughout the evening to dancers.
Sue Webster in charge of refresh
ments told the Daily that there would
be lots of both.
The International Club dance will
be the only dance scheduled for Fri
day night on the campus, so the
crowd is expected to be large.
Miss Tolnay's committee for the
dance is as follows: Esther Belew,
patrons; Bob Myhre, records; Sue
Webster, refreshments and the pub
lic address system.
