# Third Play-off Results Told
## 
### 
Women's intramural volleyball
teams last night witnessed the third
play-ofT of the Thursday league
when seven more teams came closer
to reaching top spot, in the finals.
Roble 1C defeated Roble 1A by win
ning two games out of three in a
fairly tough battle.
Roble IB fought their way through
to a 2-0 victory over Branner 1W;
while Branner 2E easily outclassed
their numerically superior opponents,
Roble 2C, with a 2-0 win. Branner
2E played almost professional ball
with the help of two outstanding
players, Joan Bailey and Mary Staf
ford.
Also inferior numerically, Roble I
center struggled through to a 2-0
game victory over Casa Adelfa; and
Ventura barely beat Roble 3C in an
evenly fought game with a 2-1 score.
May Hurlburt House was easily the
best team on the floor working in
close co-ordination to defeat Casa
Eucalypto 2-0. An outstanding net
game was played by Shirley Sneath
whose smashing volleys accounted
for a good portion of Hurlburt's
points. Storey House was collectively
annoyed to win their game from
Branner 3rd by default.
