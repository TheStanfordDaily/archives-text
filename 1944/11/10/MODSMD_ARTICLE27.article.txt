The last Friday night dance was
hampered silghtly by what Bing
Crosby has taught all Easterners to
believe is a substance not unlike
rain (notice the use of (he double
negative); yet strangely not like
rain; having the same effect as rain;
falling from the skies; usually occur
ring when there are clouds overhead
(or substances in the form and shape
of clouds—might be camouflaged Jap
dirigibles), and falling in the some
what spheroidical shape of raindrops.

Oh the Saturday night dances! Gee,
what I didn't see with my little flash
•ght. Monroe and Washington were
reasonably dark (the only time I
could recognize anyone was when
they lit cigarettes). But Sequoia
scared away a good many of us by
that glaring front light. My sym
pathies to the sponsors of the Mon
roe dance whose chocolates were pil
fered, and whose new deck of cards
were opened. Really you should be
more careful—you never can tell
what kind of people will drop into
these open affairs. (Signed, Jesse
