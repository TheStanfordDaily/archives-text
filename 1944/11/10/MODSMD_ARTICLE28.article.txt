# White Speaks On Industry

### 
"Industry is largely a matter of
geography," declared C. Langdon
White, professor of geography, last
night at the fourth meeting of the
Hispanic World series.
Professor White, chairman of the
newly created Committee on Latin
American studies, continued his dis
cussion by listing the three major
industrial regions of the world,
which he said are eastern sections
of the United States, portions of
western Europe, and parts of the
Far East—Japan in particular.
Stressing what he called the main
point of his lecture, Professor White
asked, "What is the future of South
America. Can it become important
industrially?"
The speaker then related what he
considers to be three salient factors
in the answer to these questions and
evaluated South America in regard
to them.
"The character and the will of the
people," according to Professor
White, plays an important part in
the shaping of the future of a coun
try industrially, and the majority of
the South American nations have
no industrial background.
Secondly, the resources at the com
mand of the people have a great deal
to do with determining whether a
nation will become a manufacturing
country.
Professor White stated that there
are two major divisions in the realm
of resources —climate and mineral
resources.
South America is rich in all kinds
of mineral resources, but is not so
fortunate in regard to climatic con
ditions, since most of the South
American countries are not in the
"cyclonic" or temperate zone which
geography experts believe to be es
sential to industry.
"New and changed world condi
tions" was the third factor named by
the lecturer as playing a vital part
in the answering of the industrial
question.
Applying this last phase to South
America, Professor White declared
that these countries were for the
most part geared entirely for the ex
port of raw materials and the import
of manufactured goods. Although,
some of the countries have developed
some industrial plants since the last
World War.
