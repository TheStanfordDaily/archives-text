# Local Movies Reviewed; Weekend Looks Dismal

The Stanford Theater is currently
showing two "B" pictures that are
unworthy of much mention. First
is "Bride By Mistake," another of
the love versus money stories that
appear with maddening regularity.
Laraine Day and Alan Marshall have
feature roles. Nothing outstanding
here, but Laraine Day does show
quite a flair for sexy comedy.
"Atlantic City," Republic's annual
"big" picture, tells the success story
of the big eastern resort. Paul
Whiteman's orchestra and a bunch
of rather motley talent. Republic
had better stick to Roy Rogers and
his educated horse.
The Varsity doesn't do much bet
ter by exhibiting two "A" i%?tures
that have proved minor flops. You
might be able to recognize "The
Hairy Ape" as Eugene O'Neill's play
of the same name. The film version
stars William Bendix as the "ape"
that scares Susan Hayward, who
again proves herself to be Holly
wood's ablest temptress.
Rounding out the Varsity bill is
another Pat O'Brien picture, "Marine
Raiders." It's the same old story of
"get out there and fight boys," only
this time O'Brien is not on the side
lines of a football field.

The Menlo Park Theater really
turns back the clock with two oldies.
First, Eddie Cantor in "The Kid
from Spain" and second, Humphrey
Bogart in "Dead End." But if you
head up to the Menlo, don't get side
tracked at one of those "havens of

rest" along the left side of the road.
