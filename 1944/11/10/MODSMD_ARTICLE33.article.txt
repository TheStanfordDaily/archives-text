# Un-Dated Girl Mourns In Room During 'Victoire Parisienne'
## 
### MARION MORROW 
She sat before the freshly cleaned
desk and glared vengefully upon
the Western Civ book opened on the
neat green blotter. Her right hand
turned the pages rapidly while her
left unconsciously kept time to the
sweet and soft music drifting in on
the gentle tornado winds banging
past her window.
She sighed, and stood up grace
fully on one leg, at the same time
throwing Burns out the window into
the storm. Her long blond hair
drooped disconsolately, and she ab
stractedly poured on a little per
oxide.
Why did she bother? It was Sat
urday, and life held nothing for her.
Not because it was Saturday, but
because she had just suffered the
greatest tragedy of anyone's life.
She Sobs
She sobbed heroically as she
thought of it—no, she must be brave;
after all, look what Aquinas had
been through. It was hard, though,
and with this she turned toward
the window, then stopped.
Absolutely she would not give in
—she would not resort to the win
dow. It would just prove her weak
ness. Taking everything into con
sideration, she had had a good life.
Short, to be sure, but unfortunately
{rood.
Nasty Occurrences
Of course there had been a few
r.asty occurrences, like the time the
gum machine had not given any
gum back. Or the time it had rained
on her new mascara right in front
•of her English teacher. Or the time
the Old Boy had refused to speak
lo her.
At this thought she chewed her
fingernails. Lacking any more fin
gernails a look of resolution swept
over her and she jumped up and
dashed to the window.
There She Was
Faster and faster she dashed until
ihere she was. She breathed deeply
—now was the time—there it was
Jaid out before her on the other side
of the glistening window.
It was Paris at its best. Gay Paris
•with its charming streets and awe
inspiring memorials and Bohemian
people. Nostalgic Paris with its sad
memories and its 'happy memories
and its bright future. Sophisticated
Paris with its well-dressed couples
and its cosmopolitan dance - halls.
Musical Paris with its colorful tunes
and its world-famous orchestras.
<uazing Out
Yet she stood there and gazed
through the window—yet she stood
outside looking in. And she gritted
her teeth and clenched her fists and
s-tepped on her toes because she
couldn't join the crowd inside.

Because she hadn't gotten a Blind
Date for "La Victoire Parisienne"
when she had found that "he" could
not come. She had muttered bel
ligerently that "There are no men."
She had not gone to the hall Blind
Date chairman to say resolutely, "I'll
be patriotic. I'll go to the Roble,
Branner, Ventura formal tomorrow
night and dance and devour re
freshments by the plateful. 1 will,
I will, I will!!!"
So now on Saturday night she
suffers a real 20th century tragedy,
and she's sorry.
