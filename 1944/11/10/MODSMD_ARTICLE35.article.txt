# Rest Home Past Told
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
The Women's Rest Home began
modestly some 14 years ago, while
the Palo Alto Hospital was still small
and unable to care adequately for its
patients.
Two women, Mrs. Thomas and Mrs.
Shoup, had the grand idea of pro
viding a place for students to go
when they were forced to leave the
hospital, but were not yet ready to
battle college crowds.
Their original idea has expanded
into two rest homes, each with a
capacity of about 10 people, that take
care of every sort of minor trouble,
especially colds, poison ouk, and rest
cases.
Mrs. Murray, the director of the
Women's Rest Home, emphasizes that
she accepts only girls recommended
by the Women's Health Service. She
can thus be sure that serious cases or
those with temperatures will go to
the hospital instead. Only in cases of
serious epidemics does the Rest Home
take over hospital duties.
Newcomers to the Rest Home are
generally a little fearful, the name
sounds so impressive, but most want
to return even before they leave. The
treatment is not drastic, the food is
wonderful, and they all fall in love
with Mrs. Murray.
Many students go there periodi
cally to get away from the mob and
catch up on badly needed sleep and
homework in its peaceful atmo
sphere. Often they want to live
there permanently and have to be
told when its time to leave.
In spite of the excellent care, the
charge is small, only a dollar a day
for each student. Other fees are paid
by the University for the first five
days as part of the student health
fund. Most of the supplies are pro
vided by the Stanford Mothers' Club.
