# 'Eddy' Test To Be Given
## 
### 
The Navy's "Eddy" Test will be
given again at Stanford, Tuesday,
Nov. 28, at 1:30 p.m. in Room 214
for all boys who desire to enter the
Navy as Radio Technicians. Taking
this test does not obligate a boy to
join the Navy, but it is needed for
qualification as a Radio Technician.
Any man between the ages of 17
and 50 1 may take the "Eddy" Test.
Boys at Stanford who desire to take
it are requested to give their names
tcf the Dean of Men's Ofiice.
The only requirements of the test
are a sound knowledge of high school
algebra and an aptitude for scientific
subjects. The test consists of prob
lems of basic mathematics, funda
mental electricity, elementary phys
ics, practical shopwork, and simple
radio.
Those who pass the "Eddy" Test
and join the Navy will automatically
receive the rating of Seaman, First
Class, and first be sent to a Naval
Training Station for indoctrination,
and then to a Pre-Radio School for
one month.
From there they will proceed to a
Primary School for three months.
After completion of this school they
will be promoted to the rating of
Radio Technician, Third Class, and
be transfered to a Secondary School
for five months.
After Secondary School the stu
dent will be promoted to Radio
Technician, Second Class and then
transferred to active duty afloat or
ashore.
This is the second time the test has
been given at Stanford. Last April
37 students took and passed the test
with consistently high scores. Many
of these men are now training in the
Navy's Radio Technician Program.
