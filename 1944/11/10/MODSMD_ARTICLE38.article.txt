# Cardinals Add to Spirit Since Founding in 1934
## 
### 
Entrusted with keeping alive the Stanford spirit since 1934, Cardinals,
activities committee of the campus, this autumn enters its tenth historic
year of drives, rallies, and all-campus get-togethers.
Cardinals was born with the A.S.S.U. constitution of October 1934, as
one of three committees forming an Activities Council. The Council in-

cluded Cardinals, Rally Committee,
and Women's Committee.
Cardinals Succced Rally Com.
Since the war's onslaught into the
field of intercollegiate sports, activi
ties of Rally Committee have been
merged into those of Cardinals. Spe
cifically, the duties of the committee
were to supervise the Rally Com
mittee and Women's Committee, and,
among the duties still carried on to
take charge of A.S.S.U. functions
under Excom. Cardinals also enter
tains visiting celebrities and other
University guests.
HMOC Members

Fayram, Jim Reynolds, Ed Luce, and
Charlie Clark. Ex-officio members,

lated to those of Cardinals, are War

President Speaks
Mrs. Hammond said "Cardinals
were designed to maintain school
spirit, conduct University drives, and
direct activities on an all-campus
scale. Judging from the turn-out
for activities sponsored thus far,
there has been no let-up in spirit
and the sale of tickets for the Cal-
USC game seems to guarantee a dis
play of Stanford spirit on a Big
Game scale."
Chairman of the group during its
formative period was Miriam Kropp;

she was succeeded by Willard Eisner,
first president, and director of Cardi
nals for 1934-35. Dick Stark, head
cheerleader for the rooters of '36, was
second president, and third came
Chick Franich.
