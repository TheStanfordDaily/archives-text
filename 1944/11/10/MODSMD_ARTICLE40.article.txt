First Bawlout
The first student directory was
published when the school first
opened in October, 1891. It was
«even pages long and contained the
mes of the school officers, and an
alphabetical list of the 475 students
with their majors, where they were
from, and where thoy lived on cam
pus. There were two living groups
then, Encina and Roble, so many of
the students lived off campus. No
grade points were listed.
The Bawlout for October, 1901,
had expanded to 15 pages, listing
the G92 students, and it was in that
year, that a record of the units com
pleted by the students was shown.
There still were no grade indications.
Also there were additional living
groups: two new halls, one sorority
and two fraternities.
By October, 1905, the directory
had assumed its present form, ex
cept for the fact that grades were
still being kept a very dark secret,
and only units were recorded. There
were then 1,366 students.
The present plus-minus point rec
ord was begun in the school year
1920-21.

Here you can look up that long-lost
professor who gave you an "A," and

it couldn't have been your smile,
and (2) he's absent on leave, so
you'll have to struggle along on D's

the Assistants, followed by the fel
lows, the technical assistants, and the
Assistants in Administration.
"Say, won't you please tell me

Next are listed the winners of schol
arships, the winners of awards and

First Bawlout
The first student directory was
published when the school first
opened in October, 1891. It was
«even pages long and contained the
mes of the school officers, and an
alphabetical list of the 475 students
with their majors, where they were
from, and where thoy lived on cam
pus. There were two living groups
then, Encina and Roble, so many of
the students lived off campus. No
grade points were listed.
The Bawlout for October, 1901,
had expanded to 15 pages, listing
the G92 students, and it was in that
year, that a record of the units com
pleted by the students was shown.
There still were no grade indications.
Also there were additional living
groups: two new halls, one sorority
and two fraternities.
By October, 1905, the directory
had assumed its present form, ex
cept for the fact that grades were
still being kept a very dark secret,
and only units were recorded. There
were then 1,366 students.
The present plus-minus point rec
