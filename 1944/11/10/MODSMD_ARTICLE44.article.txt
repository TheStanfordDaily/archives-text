# WAR FRONTS

### Elliot Epsteen 
The enemy resistance in the battle
of the Philippines seems to be pretty
disjointed at this stage. It appears
that if he can get his hands on a
rowboat and a soldier armed with a
broken beer bottle, he'll throw both
into the fight until something else
comes along. The enemy is commit
ting everything piecemeal, and as
soon as he get it into the theater.
This, of course, does not make for
anything but defeats, while a co
ordinated employment of all avail
able resources might give them a
chance.
His first stroke was naval. Hav
ing been caught off guard, he tried
to gamble his fleet without necessary
air cover, that having been blasted
to pieces. The result was one of the
worst naval defeats in history.
New Stroke
Then, after that, he ferried the
much needed aircraft from other
bases, and threw that into raids on
our positions and island bases far
ther back. He also used it to cover
the landing of troops on Leyte to
stiffen his resistance there.
Land Strategy
The latter seems to be the third of
spasmodic efforts to accomplish
something. He might well have been
right in his attempts, since he might
have calculated that it was better to
risk the limited forces available than
wait for vis to consolidate, but those
forces would unquestionably have
had a better chance if they were
lumped together and used together.
Whether the Japanese intend to use
the reinforcements sent to Leyte to
simply check us or to try a full-scale

' counterattack is a question that can
! not be answered at this point. The
i latter, however, would be somewhat
facilitated by our general disposi
tions.
Catching the enemy by surprise,
General Mac Arthur seems to have
I found only a light garrison on the
I island, and quite correctly spread
i his army out into a wide net, hop-
I ing to envelop the enemy here. But
! the Japanese retreated to the coast,
j and there established a compact
\ tete-du-pont around various landing
I areas. Enemy convoys, covered by
l aircraft and recent bad weather,
j have gotten more troops ashore, and
J now General Mac Arthur had to bring
j his columns, necessarily dispersed
I since he tried to effect an encircle
| ment, together, or risk having his
] line pierced. The bad weather is
helping him, too, since it forestalls a
blow if the enemy is intending to
! make it.
