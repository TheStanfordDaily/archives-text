Many Guests Expected

thousand guests, complimented the
men, saying I think the freshmen

in planning this reception for Mrs.

the outstanding social funtcions of
he quarter."

said Mrs. Schatz, "for students, fami
lies and professors to greet one an
other, and I'm deeply appreciative
of the occasion being in my honor."
