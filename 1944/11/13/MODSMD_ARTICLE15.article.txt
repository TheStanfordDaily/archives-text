The Stanford Daily is as poor as a churchmouse, and at times
in the last few years has almost been willing to accept charity.
Last Saturday night, however, we were hit below the belt. Some
one—obviously a person who doesn't realize that under the Honor
Code at Stanford everyone is considered honest—broke into a
locked desk drawer in the Daily's business office and stole
528.75 in cash and some stamps.
This amount stolen from anyone would be a blow, but the
Daily loss is a calamity. We v/ere surprised that anyone at Stan
ford should enter the profession of burglary, and although the
Daily with extra effort may re-earn this money, we hope that simi
lar burglaries will not happen to other penniless campus organi
zations.—Hodgdon.
