# Cabbages and Things by Ed Maher

Have you ever visited an historic shrine anywhere, even in
'.his country, and noticed the attitude of the other people around
you? The men remove their hats and the women move closer
to their children in order to control their noise lest the respected
silence of the place be insulted. Whether it be a California mission
or the Donner monument, Washington's tomb or the Great Stone
Face, this procedure follows.
This, to me, signifies the acceptance and existence of ghosts in
'he minds of modern people. I am not in disaccord with this pop
ular sentiment, and I do not intend to reform our ways of think
ing and promote cold realism over apparent primitivism; quite
the contrary: I really like and approve of the existence of ghosts,
{112 there were no ghosts in our lives, there would be no removing
of hats or respectful silences anywhere, except perhaps in the
presence of a few movie stars.
We have innumerable ghosts at Stanford. They walk at night
and they walk in the early morning; they walk on the Quad Sat
urday afternoons and ride the highways Saturday nights. In
short, they do all the things we are doing now, and some of the
things we are no longer doing for a while. They are the reason
we are dissatisfied with things as they are, and why we want to
restore campus life to what we call "the good old days." For
these old days remain before us as something desirable only
in the presence of our ghosts who, by their collective earthly
works, have made Stanford the place of our collegiate choice.
I shouldn't try and name these spirits, for they are all our own,
personal and private. Some of them we appreciate in common,
like Hugh Gallerneau or Pop Warner, if you are athletically in
slined or informed, but most of ihem relatively insignificant names
with which we have become familiar-because of our own sincere
interests. Some of them may be as familiar as our mothers and
fathers, for they may really be just that; others we may have
never seen, but they stand as real forces in our enjoyment of
Stanford or as measurements of our success here.
♦ Out of my exclusive crowd of ghosts, there is only one who
actually haunts me in the usual sense of the word. In odd mo
ments he hovers over me in the fashion of one of Thurber's
fantastic cartoons. Yet he is a driving factor in the continuation
of this column; although he still lives and is active in mundane
affairs, he is yet a spiritual influence at Stanford, which power
defines a ghost. His name is R. W. Kenny.

and they walk in the early morning; they walk on the Quad Sat
urday afternoons and ride the highways Saturday nights. In
short, they do all the things we are doing now, and some of the
things we are no longer doing for a while. They are the reason
we are dissatisfied with things as they are, and why we want to
restore campus life to what we call "the good old days." For
these old days remain before us as something desirable only
in the presence of our ghosts who, by their collective earthly
works, have made Stanford the place of our collegiate choice.
I shouldn't try and name these spirits, for they are all our own,
personal and private. Some of them we appreciate in common,
like Hugh Gallerneau or Pop Warner, if you are athletically in
slined or informed, but most of ihem relatively insignificant names
with which we have become familiar-because of our own sincere
interests. Some of them may be as familiar as our mothers and
fathers, for they may really be just that; others we may have
never seen, but they stand as real forces in our enjoyment of
Stanford or as measurements of our success here.
♦ Out of my exclusive crowd of ghosts, there is only one who
actually haunts me in the usual sense of the word. In odd mo
ments he hovers over me in the fashion of one of Thurber's
fantastic cartoons. Yet he is a driving factor in the continuation
of this column; although he still lives and is active in mundane
affairs, he is yet a spiritual influence at Stanford, which power
defines a ghost. His name is R. W. Kenny.
Have you ever visited an historic shrine anywhere, even in
'.his country, and noticed the attitude of the other people around
you? The men remove their hats and the women move closer
to their children in order to control their noise lest the respected
silence of the place be insulted. Whether it be a California mission
or the Donner monument, Washington's tomb or the Great Stone
Face, this procedure follows.
This, to me, signifies the acceptance and existence of ghosts in
'he minds of modern people. I am not in disaccord with this pop
ular sentiment, and I do not intend to reform our ways of think
ing and promote cold realism over apparent primitivism; quite
the contrary: I really like and approve of the existence of ghosts,
{112 there were no ghosts in our lives, there would be no removing
of hats or respectful silences anywhere, except perhaps in the
presence of a few movie stars.
We have innumerable ghosts at Stanford. They walk at night
and they walk in the early morning; they walk on the Quad Sat
urday afternoons and ride the highways Saturday nights. In
short, they do all the things we are doing now, and some of the
things we are no longer doing for a while. They are the reason
