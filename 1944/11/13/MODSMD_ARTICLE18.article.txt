# BULL SESSION
## 
### Dick Crane 
Today's session is going to be a sad, sad tale, and through
the medium of this story, I hope to bring to light something that
is happening to this campus. Things are definitely wrong around
here, and I feel there should be a drastic change.
The beginning of the story takes place at the Student Rela
tions Smoker of last Friday night, at which a new Stanford
"rough" meets the girl of his dreams. After dancing with this
gueen four or five times, he finally gathers enough courage to
ask her for a date for the next night, which is Saturday evening.
She accepts, with a coy, convulsive shudder, and the "rough"
is practically "out of this world," with anticipation, and ulterior
motives.
The "rough" spends all day Saturday getting very "sharp,"
while the girl toils from morning to dusk, polishing her brass
knuckles, and shining up her suit of armor.
It is now after dark, and the "wolves" are out in packs. This
particular "wolf" runs with all the speed that he can muster up
to the."dorm" of his firsj date, so that he won't lose a moment
of valuable time.—The lack of time, due to one-thirties
He walks into the room, calls for his date, and after a long
wait —three seconds—the girl comes gracefully down the stairs
(four steps at a time). She smiles shyly at her man, and coos,
"Hey, bub, let's get the hell out of this joint." He says, "Okay,
chicken; let's put the show on the road." She then says, "What's
on the program this evening?" He is at a loss, because it so hap
pens that nothing is doing on the campus this particular Saturday
night.—This also happens on a lot of weekends this guarter.
The sad part of the story happens now, because they go to the
only two dances on the campus, which are "closed" affairs, and
at each one, they are gently thrown out on their fannies. They
finally end up at one of the "gin mills" down the highway, and
before the evening is over, everyone is "fried."
The purpose of this tale is to try to show the people respon
sible for the social policy, and the various regulations concern
ing drinking, that they should also try to find something for the
students to do on the weekends.
Friday and Saturday nights are "going out" nights in this
country, and are a part of our existence like baseball games and
movies. If the people responsible for student government on
this campus want to have the students follow the social policy,
they should find a method of helping them do it, and not hinder
them.
Summing up the whole session, I wish to say that I am
against closed campus affairs if they are strictly invitational.

this campus want to have the students follow the social policy,
they should find a method of helping them do it, and not hinder
them.
Summing up the whole session, I wish to say that I am
against closed campus affairs if they are strictly invitational.

"STUBBY OF THE WEEK"
To Dr. Lan Popper, of the music department, who has forever
endeared himself to the hearts of all the people of this campus
who saw him at the "Smoker" last weekend. His excellent lead
ing of the community singing was the highlight of a wonderful
program.
Today's session is going to be a sad, sad tale, and through
the medium of this story, I hope to bring to light something that
is happening to this campus. Things are definitely wrong around
here, and I feel there should be a drastic change.
The beginning of the story takes place at the Student Rela
tions Smoker of last Friday night, at which a new Stanford
"rough" meets the girl of his dreams. After dancing with this
gueen four or five times, he finally gathers enough courage to
ask her for a date for the next night, which is Saturday evening.
She accepts, with a coy, convulsive shudder, and the "rough"
is practically "out of this world," with anticipation, and ulterior
motives.
The "rough" spends all day Saturday getting very "sharp,"
while the girl toils from morning to dusk, polishing her brass
knuckles, and shining up her suit of armor.
It is now after dark, and the "wolves" are out in packs. This
particular "wolf" runs with all the speed that he can muster up
to the."dorm" of his firsj date, so that he won't lose a moment
of valuable time.—The lack of time, due to one-thirties
He walks into the room, calls for his date, and after a long
wait —three seconds—the girl comes gracefully down the stairs
(four steps at a time). She smiles shyly at her man, and coos,
"Hey, bub, let's get the hell out of this joint." He says, "Okay,
chicken; let's put the show on the road." She then says, "What's
on the program this evening?" He is at a loss, because it so hap
pens that nothing is doing on the campus this particular Saturday
night.—This also happens on a lot of weekends this guarter.
The sad part of the story happens now, because they go to the
only two dances on the campus, which are "closed" affairs, and
at each one, they are gently thrown out on their fannies. They
finally end up at one of the "gin mills" down the highway, and
before the evening is over, everyone is "fried."
The purpose of this tale is to try to show the people respon
sible for the social policy, and the various regulations concern
ing drinking, that they should also try to find something for the
students to do on the weekends.
Friday and Saturday nights are "going out" nights in this
country, and are a part of our existence like baseball games and
movies. If the people responsible for student government on
this campus want to have the students follow the social policy,
they should find a method of helping them do it, and not hinder
them.
Summing up the whole session, I wish to say that I am
