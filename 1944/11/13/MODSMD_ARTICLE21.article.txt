# Checkroom Tie-up Causes Lockouts
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
All regard for formals was forgot
ten Saturday night as bedraggled
Robleites pulled their frills knee
high and raced through the drizzling
rain in their best pliys ed form fc>-
ward the unfeeling Roble door.
Some, who had the foresight to put
their wraps in their gym lockers at
the Roble-Branner-Ventura formal,
gloated smugly within Roble while
the second hand on the lobby clock
whisked unconcernedly past the 1:30
mark.
According to Mrs. Mort, Roble
night assistant, between forty and
fifty lock-outs, ranging from one
half to fifteen minutes, were issued
to girls who had been delayed at the
dance by the checking room tie-up.
Mrs. Mort, who is accustomed to un
locking the door for single lock
outees, was virtually mobbed by a
steady stream of late-comers shov
ing their way toward the door.
That was the second major state
of bedlam in which Roble had found
itself in that one momentous evening.
The first reigned from 9:00 until 9:30,
at which time over fifty bewildered
men called for their blind dates. As
usual, the buzzer system was on the
job, but merely served the purpose
of adding over fifty bewildered girls
to the confused lobby-full.
Many were the feminine faces
which fell when they emerged from
behind the swinging doors to be
greeted by scores of expectant male
faces. Such date bureau descriptions
as "a tall blond sailor." or "a me
dium-sized 17-year-old. with a crew
cut" were of little avail in this case
—the trial and error method was the
only workable scheme.
Responsible for this blind-date
godsend was Joyce Costello, Roble
social chairman.
