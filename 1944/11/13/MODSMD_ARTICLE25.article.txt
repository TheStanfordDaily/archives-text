H.M.S. PINAFORE AT THE BUSH
STREET MUSIC HALL AS DONE
BY THE SAVOY OPERA COM
PANY.
This Gilbert and Sullivan produc
tion is pronounced well worth the
train ride to the city, several street
j car transfers and a walk up a San
j Francisco hill, to see.

The Bush Street
theatre is small
and congenial, an
ideal setting for
Gilbert and Sulli
van. Coffee and
i sandwiches are
served during the
intermission, along
with impromptu
performances by
the cast and the

For instance, at the Saturday eve*
■ ning performance, none other than
Stanford's Professor B. Q. Morgan
of the Department of Germanic Lan
guages. Stanford Players, and many
I student rallies, stole the show wilh
j his rendition of "Tit-willow."
The productions are well-cast,
well-costumed, and the performers
not only sing well but also have a
fine sense of melodrama. They wan
der through the audience to the
stage with nonchalance, never step
ping out of character for a minute,
even while tripping over small boys'
feet in the aisle.
Especially notable in Pinafore
i were the gallant but jovial Captain,
j the sinister villain Dick Deadeye,
j who had one of the best voices in the
i cast, and a chorus of pink-cheeked
j sailors who dance a hornpipe with
j abandon.
Bush Street Music Hall would be
I a pleasant place to spend an after -
j noon or evening even if there were

! no Gilbert and Sullivan being
: The combination makes one l'eel for
j any people who cannot get up to see
j these shows which continue from
: November 17 with The Mikado and
in December with the Pirates of
