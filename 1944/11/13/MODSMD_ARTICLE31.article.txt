# Cap and Gown Society Established Here in '06
## By BETH MacVICAR

A line of women, wearing /lowing
black gowns and the mortar boards
' identified with graduation - time,
| threads its way through the diagram
j of tables. Where before there was a
! loud buzz of voices and a compan-
I ionable clatter of forks and spoons,
I there now is silence. All eyes watch
j the quiet procession as it passes
] among them. And then there is a
frightened, happy shriek and then
! delighted bursts of applause. Cap and
! Gown has tapped another member.
Every spring quarter, and perhaps
j more often, Cap and Gown selects
| several for membership from among
| those women outstanding in activi
ties and scholarship. At dinner-time
on an appointed night, the active
j members, led by their president and
I clothed in the traditional caps and
I gowns, enter the dining rooms and
i tap the specified women.
| !iX-year History
' These women have, at that mo
; ment, become part of an organiza
: tion that has a history of 38 years and
I a membership of hundreds of Stan
; ford women and friends. They belong
| to an organization whose purpose is,
! according to Miss Edith Mirrielees,
| "to draw together undergraduate
j women interested in various phases
| of student activity, especially with a
; view to preventing the growth of any
j barriers between those with one set
of interests and those of another, and
j to provide a body for discussion of
the various problems that arise in
j connection with student life."
Membership is not restricted to
| student women; honorary members
| are selected from among faculty
; women, or women in the community
j who have made a genuine contribu
tion to the life of those on campus.
i Alumnae Return
|
In addition, according to Dean
Mary Yost, honorary member, Cap
and Gown has always kept in touch
! with its alumnae. Active members
have the opportunity at their meet
| ings to become acquainted with re
j turning alumnae.
Cap and Gown was founded in
i 190(>, "ante earthquake," by Hazel
Pedlar Faulkner, Alice Hayes Chal
' mers and Miss Mirrielees. They were
I sitting on a fence, according to leg-
J end, and they decided in the course
j of conversation that there should be
i some organization on campus whose

members would be drawn from lead
ers of all activities which work for
the university in general.
Postponement
With the coming of the earthquake,
operation of the organization was
postponed until 1907, when, in addi
tion to the charter members, Jessie
J McGilvray Treat, Nora Dunn Henley
and Emma Hayward Kalenborn put
it into action.
Among the original faculty were
Mrs. John C. Branner and Mrs. H. J.
j Ryan.
Miss Mirrielees pointed out that
! Cap and Gown differs from honor
| organizations of other universities in
• the two ways:
Unique Organization
I"It is solely a Stanford organiza-
I tion, having never affiliated with na
tional honor societies. Second, it
early established and has consistent
ly kept its insistence on scholarly
standards."
The present scholastic requirement
is a B-average and upper division
standing.
During the year, Cap and Gown's
activities are directed to the raising
of money for one or two scholarships.
Principal source of money for this is
the sale at Christmas time of calen
dars, edited by Miss Inna Jean Han
i nibal, secretary to Dean Yost, and a
J former active member.
| Present Officers
President this year is Luana Fork
j ner; Sally Breuner is secretary;
Frances Mclnnis, vice-president, and
Lorraine Streblow, treasurer.
Mis. David Starr Jordan and Mrs.
Ray Lyman Wilbur are honorary
members; Mrs. Donald B. Tresidder
was an active member as a student.
Miss Yost and Miss Anastasia Doyle
are honoraries. Roble director, Miss

Mrs .Frances T. Nielson were actives.

In addition, according to Dean
Mary Yost, honorary member, Cap
and Gown has always kept in touch
! with its alumnae. Active members
have the opportunity at their meet
| ings to become acquainted with re
j turning alumnae.
Cap and Gown was founded in
i 190(>, "ante earthquake," by Hazel
Pedlar Faulkner, Alice Hayes Chal
' mers and Miss Mirrielees. They were
I sitting on a fence, according to leg-
J end, and they decided in the course
j of conversation that there should be
i some organization on campus whose

members would be drawn from lead
ers of all activities which work for
the university in general.
Postponement
With the coming of the earthquake,
operation of the organization was
postponed until 1907, when, in addi
tion to the charter members, Jessie
J McGilvray Treat, Nora Dunn Henley
and Emma Hayward Kalenborn put
it into action.
Among the original faculty were
Mrs. John C. Branner and Mrs. H. J.
j Ryan.
Miss Mirrielees pointed out that
! Cap and Gown differs from honor
| organizations of other universities in
• the two ways:
Unique Organization
I"It is solely a Stanford organiza-
I tion, having never affiliated with na
tional honor societies. Second, it
early established and has consistent
ly kept its insistence on scholarly
standards."
The present scholastic requirement
is a B-average and upper division
standing.
During the year, Cap and Gown's
activities are directed to the raising
of money for one or two scholarships.
Principal source of money for this is
the sale at Christmas time of calen
dars, edited by Miss Inna Jean Han
i nibal, secretary to Dean Yost, and a
J former active member.
| Present Officers
President this year is Luana Fork
j ner; Sally Breuner is secretary;
Frances Mclnnis, vice-president, and
Lorraine Streblow, treasurer.
Mis. David Starr Jordan and Mrs.
Ray Lyman Wilbur are honorary
members; Mrs. Donald B. Tresidder
was an active member as a student.
Miss Yost and Miss Anastasia Doyle
are honoraries. Roble director, Miss
Rosamond Clarke, and Lagunita's
Mrs .Frances T. Nielson were actives.
Mother of Registrar J. P. Mitchell
was made an honorary member on
I her 89th birthday last year.
A line of women, wearing /lowing
black gowns and the mortar boards
' identified with graduation - time,
| threads its way through the diagram
j of tables. Where before there was a
! loud buzz of voices and a compan-
I ionable clatter of forks and spoons,
I there now is silence. All eyes watch
j the quiet procession as it passes
] among them. And then there is a
frightened, happy shriek and then
! delighted bursts of applause. Cap and
! Gown has tapped another member.
Every spring quarter, and perhaps
j more often, Cap and Gown selects
| several for membership from among
| those women outstanding in activi
ties and scholarship. At dinner-time
on an appointed night, the active
j members, led by their president and
I clothed in the traditional caps and
I gowns, enter the dining rooms and
i tap the specified women.
| !iX-year History
' These women have, at that mo
; ment, become part of an organiza
: tion that has a history of 38 years and
I a membership of hundreds of Stan
; ford women and friends. They belong
| to an organization whose purpose is,
! according to Miss Edith Mirrielees,
| "to draw together undergraduate
j women interested in various phases
| of student activity, especially with a
; view to preventing the growth of any
j barriers between those with one set
of interests and those of another, and
j to provide a body for discussion of
the various problems that arise in
j connection with student life."
Membership is not restricted to
| student women; honorary members
| are selected from among faculty
; women, or women in the community
j who have made a genuine contribu
tion to the life of those on campus.
