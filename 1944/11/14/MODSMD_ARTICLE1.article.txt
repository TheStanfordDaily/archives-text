# Students Unite To Welcome Tresidder Back to Campus
## 
### 
More than three-quarters of the
student body trekked up Mirada
Street last night in an all-campus
serenade to welcome Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder, president of Stanford
University, home from a month
long tour of American colleges and
educators' meetings.
The sing began at Lagunita, col
lected the women from Roble, and
proceeded up the Row, gathering
strength as women from Branner
and Union, men from Toyon, and
students from the houses on the Row
joined the force of marching Indians.
Led by part of the Stanford band
under the direction of Dick Flint,
with cheers and songs being led by
Cheerleader Ric Supple, the sere
naders left Lagunita at 7, arriving
at the Tresidder home .">5 minutes
later, singing "Come Join the
Band" as Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder
appeared smiling 011 the front
porch.
The Tresidders listened attentively
at the group gave out with "The
Cardinal Is Waving," "Sons of the
Stanford Red," and "For He's a Jolly
Good Fellow." Quiet then reigned
as they in turn waited for a few
words from Dr. Tresidder.
Dr. Tresidder laughed as he be
gan by saying, "You have caught
me olt base tonight. You don't
know with what reluctance I left
Stanford early this fall, and with
what joy I returned to the campus
the other day ... as I traveled
around the country I couldn't help
hut feel . . . that we are pretty

fortunate to belong to such a won
derful university.
'Wherever I went I noticed one
thing: the great bond that unites
Stanford men and women," Dr. Tre
sidder said as he told of meeting
Farm graduates in Washington, New
York, Johns Hopkins University and
other stops on his trip.
"The one question that they all
asked me was: 'Are Stanford stu
dents up to par'?" he added, an
swering that question by saying,
"As I look over this sea of faces, I
am proud that Stanford has main
tained its well-founded traditions.
I hope that you have had a good
quarter, and I'm looking forward
to spending the rest of it here."
Dr. Tresidder has been gone for a
month on a nationwide tour of edu
cators' conventions. The sing was
sponsored by Cardinals, under the
chairmanship of Charmian Kolar,
and was planned as a complete sur
prise for the Tresidders.
