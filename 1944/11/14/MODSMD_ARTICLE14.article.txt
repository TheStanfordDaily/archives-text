# ELEVEN ABSENT MEN

(Although it now appears that Cardinals, guardians of the
Axe, have decided against its use at Friday night's rally, the Stan
ford Daily realizes that this guestion will undoubtedly reoccur as
the school faces more years with no team of its own. The follow
ing editorial expresses the Daily's opinion about use of the Axe
for any purpose, however laudable, for the duration, —The Editor.)
Eleven very important Stanford men won't be able to attend
Friday night's "Big Game" rally. The red and white varsity of
1944 is conspicuously absent doing a necessary job. They are
tragically far away from the peace and happiness of Stanford.
None more than they would want this coming weekend to be a
real festival of old-time Stanford spirit. But they also want the
Stanford Axe left exactly where it is until another two groups of
Stanford and Cal men can fight it out for annual possession of what
has become one of the nation's most famous symbols of college
spirit.
It is easy to understand the motives of those who would make
the showing of the axe the central theme of the proposed rally.
They want to generate enthusiasm. This is the school's one
chance to have a real football weekend, and in some way Stanford
must feel that it is a part of the proceedings even without a team.
These are understandable aims, but not sufficient to justify the
use of the Axe.
The Stanford Axe, by reason of a long-time, honorable com
pact between ourselves and Cal, is a trophy to be awarded annu
ally to the winner of the real Big Game. It is a symbol of the
spirit which has drawn the eyes of the entire nation to this region
every November, for the rivalry between our two schools is le
gendary. But it's more than an athletic trophy. The Axe and the
early, bitter struggles revolving around it were a dominant force
in building a fighting and unified student body spirit in the early
days when Stanford itself was struggling to become a head-above
water university.
The Stanford Axe was born in 1899. The first time we brought
it to light at a baseball game in April of that year, the Berkeley
horde seized it. For seven hours the first Battle of the Axe raged
over San Francisco. Through Chinatown and down to the ferry
the Cal men shuttled their prize at the cost of untold bruises and
fractures. A certain "Crazy Joe" Hamilton took on a whole street
car load of the enemy in a famous last stand for Stanford.
Then down through the years until the spring of 1930 Cal kept
the Axe buried in the vaults of the Berkeley American Trust.
Many a Stanford brain was wracked and many a nose forcibly
remodeled, but until 1930 no local plan of rescue for the sacred
trophy was effective. The story of the immortal 21 of Seguoia
is a legend on this campus, and it appears that it is high time that
it be retold. The end result was that Stanford brains, blood, sweat,
and very, very joyful tears paid off and the Axe came home.
But the era of such rough-and-ready college spirit gave way
to the more sane and sophisticated, and a decision of our Excom
resulted in the use of the Axe as a perpetual trophy. The Vow
Boys fought for it and kept it. After they left our teams fought
just as hard without the same results. Then Shaughnessy and
his "T" brought it back one year, lost it the next, and finally in
1942 the Stanford boys won it back /or the duration.
It is a strong temptation to bring out our Axe and let current
Stanfordites enjoy an old-time Axe yell. But it is doubtful if that
yell could be as sincere as one for an actual Stanford team. After
ill this symbol has meant to the school, a sincere tribute to it
-annot be created out of our desire to have weekend's enjoyment
it the expense of our ancient rivals, USC and Cal.
In fairness to Stanford men from "Crazy Joe" Hamilton of '99
.? the Flying Indians of today, that Axe should stay where it is
mtil the eleven absent men come home.

must feel that it is a part of the proceedings even without a team.
These are understandable aims, but not sufficient to justify the
use of the Axe.
The Stanford Axe, by reason of a long-time, honorable com
pact between ourselves and Cal, is a trophy to be awarded annu
ally to the winner of the real Big Game. It is a symbol of the
spirit which has drawn the eyes of the entire nation to this region
every November, for the rivalry between our two schools is le
gendary. But it's more than an athletic trophy. The Axe and the
early, bitter struggles revolving around it were a dominant force
in building a fighting and unified student body spirit in the early
days when Stanford itself was struggling to become a head-above
water university.
The Stanford Axe was born in 1899. The first time we brought
it to light at a baseball game in April of that year, the Berkeley
horde seized it. For seven hours the first Battle of the Axe raged
over San Francisco. Through Chinatown and down to the ferry
the Cal men shuttled their prize at the cost of untold bruises and
fractures. A certain "Crazy Joe" Hamilton took on a whole street
car load of the enemy in a famous last stand for Stanford.
Then down through the years until the spring of 1930 Cal kept
the Axe buried in the vaults of the Berkeley American Trust.
Many a Stanford brain was wracked and many a nose forcibly
remodeled, but until 1930 no local plan of rescue for the sacred
trophy was effective. The story of the immortal 21 of Seguoia
is a legend on this campus, and it appears that it is high time that
it be retold. The end result was that Stanford brains, blood, sweat,
and very, very joyful tears paid off and the Axe came home.
But the era of such rough-and-ready college spirit gave way
to the more sane and sophisticated, and a decision of our Excom
resulted in the use of the Axe as a perpetual trophy. The Vow
Boys fought for it and kept it. After they left our teams fought
just as hard without the same results. Then Shaughnessy and
his "T" brought it back one year, lost it the next, and finally in
1942 the Stanford boys won it back /or the duration.
It is a strong temptation to bring out our Axe and let current
Stanfordites enjoy an old-time Axe yell. But it is doubtful if that
yell could be as sincere as one for an actual Stanford team. After
ill this symbol has meant to the school, a sincere tribute to it
-annot be created out of our desire to have weekend's enjoyment
it the expense of our ancient rivals, USC and Cal.
In fairness to Stanford men from "Crazy Joe" Hamilton of '99
.? the Flying Indians of today, that Axe should stay where it is
mtil the eleven absent men come home.
—Bill Hornby.
(Although it now appears that Cardinals, guardians of the
Axe, have decided against its use at Friday night's rally, the Stan
ford Daily realizes that this guestion will undoubtedly reoccur as
the school faces more years with no team of its own. The follow
ing editorial expresses the Daily's opinion about use of the Axe
for any purpose, however laudable, for the duration, —The Editor.)
Eleven very important Stanford men won't be able to attend
Friday night's "Big Game" rally. The red and white varsity of
1944 is conspicuously absent doing a necessary job. They are
tragically far away from the peace and happiness of Stanford.
None more than they would want this coming weekend to be a
real festival of old-time Stanford spirit. But they also want the
Stanford Axe left exactly where it is until another two groups of
Stanford and Cal men can fight it out for annual possession of what
has become one of the nation's most famous symbols of college
spirit.

car load of the enemy in a famous last stand for Stanford.
Then down through the years until the spring of 1930 Cal kept
the Axe buried in the vaults of the Berkeley American Trust.
Many a Stanford brain was wracked and many a nose forcibly
remodeled, but until 1930 no local plan of rescue for the sacred
trophy was effective. The story of the immortal 21 of Seguoia
is a legend on this campus, and it appears that it is high time that
it be retold. The end result was that Stanford brains, blood, sweat,
and very, very joyful tears paid off and the Axe came home.
But the era of such rough-and-ready college spirit gave way
to the more sane and sophisticated, and a decision of our Excom
resulted in the use of the Axe as a perpetual trophy. The Vow
Boys fought for it and kept it. After they left our teams fought
just as hard without the same results. Then Shaughnessy and
his "T" brought it back one year, lost it the next, and finally in
1942 the Stanford boys won it back /or the duration.
It is a strong temptation to bring out our Axe and let current
Stanfordites enjoy an old-time Axe yell. But it is doubtful if that
yell could be as sincere as one for an actual Stanford team. After
ill this symbol has meant to the school, a sincere tribute to it
-annot be created out of our desire to have weekend's enjoyment
it the expense of our ancient rivals, USC and Cal.
In fairness to Stanford men from "Crazy Joe" Hamilton of '99
.? the Flying Indians of today, that Axe should stay where it is
mtil the eleven absent men come home.
