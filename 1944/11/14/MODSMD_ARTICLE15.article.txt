Dear Gertie:
Remember when we were in high
school together and I ran for secre
tary of the senior class? You were* a
great help in putting my campaign
speech across. While 1 spoke, you
sat on the side of the stage an/1 be- i
fore long pretended to fall asleep and
began to snore. I went over . and j
shook you several times and asked
you to please not embarrass me so.
That was quite a performance wasn't
it? I was amazecl afterwards by the
number of people who concluded :
from that display that I had acting
ability. Because I knew they were
wrong I never did go into dramatics, |
but decided to become a dull eco
nomics major instead.
Now I'm a senior in college. You
aren't here, so I'll tell you about my
latest accomplishment. Last week I
wrote a letter criticizing a particular
column in the Daily because I didn't ;
think it was as funny as the author
intended it to be. Mainly I suppose
I was standing up for the Economics '
department, but with the predica
ment I'm in now I guess I should
have remained seated.
My letter has had some unexpected j
repercussions. From this bold act it
has been concluded that I am some
what of a humorist. Can you imag
ine! Furthermore, I have been attrib
uted with some writing ability, as j
the Bull Sessioner has invited me to
do his column for one day. What a
privilege—hanging my toothbrush in
the Daily Shack next to the great
Dick Crane's!
Yes, it's an honor, even if I were j
gently coerced to do it, in the form
of a personal challenge. I guess he is
optimistically (with tongue in cheek)
waiting for me to come out with the
most droll article he has ever seen in j
print. That is one thing I would like

to be able achieve. However, lam
aware that I lack the aptitude. If I
were to try, it would be a failure,
and since I objected to his inade
quate attempt I must not leave my
self open for another blow.
Perhaps I made a mistake long ago
and decided on the wrong major. If
I had chosen dramatics, I might now
be reading the Bull Session reli
giously, with avid interest and would
never find the slightest fault with it.
I would simply laugh and laugh and
laugh. On the other hand, maybe I
should have chosen English, then
when I came up against a dilemma
such as this one I would be able to
meet the challenge, squarely in the
face and show Dick Crane an exam
ple of a humorous tale, well written.
You see where I stand, Gertie. I
chose the wrong field of study, but
realize it too late. You were always
a smart girl and especially talented
at humor. It is hidden talent which is
being sought. Could you possibly
come to my rescue and write a really
funny Bull Session? Dick would be
very appreciative, too, as I think he
realizes that one man can't be ex
pected to be humorous and good at it
every day of his life.
Let me know soon.
With anxieiy, IRENE.

most droll article he has ever seen in j
print. That is one thing I would like

to be able achieve. However, lam
aware that I lack the aptitude. If I
were to try, it would be a failure,
and since I objected to his inade
quate attempt I must not leave my
self open for another blow.
Perhaps I made a mistake long ago
and decided on the wrong major. If
I had chosen dramatics, I might now
be reading the Bull Session reli
giously, with avid interest and would
never find the slightest fault with it.
I would simply laugh and laugh and
laugh. On the other hand, maybe I
should have chosen English, then
when I came up against a dilemma
such as this one I would be able to
meet the challenge, squarely in the
face and show Dick Crane an exam
ple of a humorous tale, well written.
You see where I stand, Gertie. I
chose the wrong field of study, but
realize it too late. You were always
a smart girl and especially talented
at humor. It is hidden talent which is
being sought. Could you possibly
come to my rescue and write a really
funny Bull Session? Dick would be
very appreciative, too, as I think he
realizes that one man can't be ex
pected to be humorous and good at it
every day of his life.
Let me know soon.

Dear Gertie:
Remember when we were in high
school together and I ran for secre
tary of the senior class? You were* a
great help in putting my campaign
speech across. While 1 spoke, you
sat on the side of the stage an/1 be- i
fore long pretended to fall asleep and
began to snore. I went over . and j
shook you several times and asked
you to please not embarrass me so.
That was quite a performance wasn't
it? I was amazecl afterwards by the
number of people who concluded :
from that display that I had acting
ability. Because I knew they were
wrong I never did go into dramatics, |
but decided to become a dull eco
nomics major instead.
Now I'm a senior in college. You
aren't here, so I'll tell you about my
latest accomplishment. Last week I
wrote a letter criticizing a particular
column in the Daily because I didn't ;
think it was as funny as the author
intended it to be. Mainly I suppose
I was standing up for the Economics '
department, but with the predica
ment I'm in now I guess I should
have remained seated.
My letter has had some unexpected j
repercussions. From this bold act it
has been concluded that I am some
what of a humorist. Can you imag
ine! Furthermore, I have been attrib
uted with some writing ability, as j
the Bull Sessioner has invited me to
do his column for one day. What a
privilege—hanging my toothbrush in
the Daily Shack next to the great
Dick Crane's!
Yes, it's an honor, even if I were j
gently coerced to do it, in the form
of a personal challenge. I guess he is
optimistically (with tongue in cheek)
waiting for me to come out with the
most droll article he has ever seen in j
print. That is one thing I would like

to be able achieve. However, lam
aware that I lack the aptitude. If I
were to try, it would be a failure,
and since I objected to his inade
