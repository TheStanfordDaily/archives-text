The strength with which we were
greeted around Aachen seems to
have been the tip-off as to the en
emy's weakness around Metz. With
a large part of his forces in Holland
disintegrating, and with a wedge
thrust into the Siegfried line at
Aachen, he seems to have robbed
this sector of his front to reinforce
the others which were more pressed.
General Patton therefore struck
out with seven divisions to throw
the enemy out of his positions there.
The decisive maneuver in this bat
tle was the advance on both sides of
Metz by the Seventh Armored
sion, which is now clamping a pin
cers around the city.
Move Considered
The dampening factors as to the
future progress in this area are two:
One, the terrain is very broken, with
considerable hills and woods, and
thus suited to the defender and to
rearguard actions to cover the re
organization of retreating columns;
two, the enemy has more good de
fense lines behind the one just lost.
However, its main importance will
be shown in its overall relation to
the whole picture.
