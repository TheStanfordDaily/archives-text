# Pigskin Teams Meet Today
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Hold your hats, gentlemen! It ain't |
gonna rain no more. At least that's
what (he weatherman tried to tell '
us when we asked if intramural foot- \
ball could proceed on its merry way |
this afternoon.
If. by the will of Lady Luck, the j
rains cease. Arguello A. A. will tae- i
kle unbeaten Firehouse in League i
lis featured game. Since both teams !
are in the winner's class, the league's j
final victor may be determined to- j
day. Tom Ashley's crew won over !
Gerona A. C. 7-G last week, while j
Arguello was winning from Toyon's |
â€¢ad Enders, 20-0.
Meanwhile, Tyler will tackle Med. !
School 11, the Mods being favored.
Kappa Dee-Gee Hashers are expect- j
ed to romp over Washington, and
Gerona is planning to maul the Dead
Enders in other league games. Toyon j
gathered its first win at the hands of |
Tyler. 13-2, in last Thursday's mud.
all others being cancelled.
A toss-up contest is slated between
Buchanan's Bearcats and Encina j
Flyers in League I's top billing.
Buchanan's victory over Sequoia
might even give them the nod. Nu
Sigma Nu (Med. Ill) is favored over
Toyon's Operators in a game that
will feature the talents of the Meds'
Dave Brown and Jackie Heald.
Sequoia and Med. I (Alpha Kappa
Kappa) will battle for honors, while
Arthur will be faced by Co. C in the
day's other contests.
