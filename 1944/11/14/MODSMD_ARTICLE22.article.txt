KISMET —now playing at the Stan
ford Theater.
Back in the days when History of
Western Civilization (MWF 10) was
m the making, Ronald .Colman was
'king of the beggars" in the city of
Bagdad. By day he would trade
blows with Edward Arnold, the
Frank Hague ol Bagdad, while after
lark his grasping hands would reach
jut in search of Marlene Dietrich.
There you have "Kismet's" story.
Indeed it's trite, but your attention
instead will be caught by the lusb,
voluptuous colors that make up this
Technicolor film. For it is dancing
girls and dazzling costumes that keep
'Kismet" from being a major Hop.
It's been a long time since we've seen
A spectacle.
Acting is standard with Arnold
urning in the most convincing job.
Dialogue ranges from the thoughtful
statement, "Truth is boredom," to
(he conventional remark, "I've met
the sweetest girl in Bagdad." You've
seen "Kismet's" plot many times, but
for sheer spectacle here is something
completely refreshing.
Back to 1944 and the second fea
ture, Republic's "Port of Forty
Thieves," in which Stephanie Baeh
ilor pushes her lovers down elevator
chutes and the such. The title refers
;o New York, because it would be
inadequate for San Francisco.
