# Farm Poet Yvor Winters Has Work Published in Anthology
## 
### MARY AL SMITH 
Yyor Winters, Stanford professor
of English and nationally known
poet, is one of two-score authors who
represent the fullness of California
life in the first anthology of its kind,
Continent's End. edited by Joseph
Henry Jackson, book reviewer for
the San Francisco Chronicle and the
New York Herald-Tribune.
The selection, "A Summer Com
mentary," is taken from Professor
Winter's recent book, The Giant
Weapon, which was reviewed by
Louise Bogan in a mid-summer New
Yorker.
Portpourri of People
In Continent's End. which ap
peared Monday for the first time on
the nation's bookshelves, you will
find a potpourri of people as differ
ent as Filipino cannery-workers, the
"drive by night" truckers, the valley
farming "Fresno Indians." the mi
grant ranch workers, the city-dwell
ing intellectuals, and the flashy Hol
lywood miracle-men.
Not only in the variety of its peo
ple is California reflected, but also
in its social and economic conflicts,
its physical characteristics, and its
history of folkways.
Madame Moustache
Of the many facets of California
history, Upton Sinclair's description
of the "black gold" boom; Duncan
Aikman's resurrected oddity of the
fifties, cigarette-rolling, vingt-et-un
dealing Madame Moustache; and the
account of tight days in a Pullman
Golden Palace car, wide open at 22
m.p.h., are deserving of special note.
The latter, a selection from Oscar
Lewis's Bis Four, tale of how Mark
Hopkins, Collis Huntington, Charles
Crocker and Leland Stanford pushed
east the railroads by which "Califor
nia annexed the United States," is of
interest to members of the Stanford
family.
S.l*, in Old Days
Travelers on the "friendly S.P." in
the 1870's who, after drousing
through miles of scenery "unsur
passed in monotony," were often
aroused to see licking the horizon
a prairie fire regularly caused by
sparks from locomotives which ig
nited the dry summer grass.
Take "pieces" from My Name is
Aram. What Makes Sammy Run?
The Postman Always Rings Twice,
add a fantastic picture of the entire
state breaking at the Sierras and
sliding into the sea (A Myron Brinig
dream), and you have some notion
of the variety of viewpoints present
in the collection.
Were the anthology not limited to
California writers, the inclusion of
something—or anything—by Archie
Binns, Washington author and for
mer Stanford man, would \mdoubt
edly increase the vitality of coastal
expression already found in "Con
tinent's End."
