### 
First tryouts for participation in
the Southern California Forensic
Contest to take place December 1
and 2 in Pasadena will be held to
morrow night at 7 in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Tryoutees for the debate team will
give five-minute speeches on the
tournament's question, "Resolved,
the United States should have com
pulsory arbitration of industrial dis
putes.''
Besides debating, the Pasadena
tournament will feature rounds of
oratory, extemporaneous speaking,
impromptu speaking and interpre
tive reading.
"The number of representatives
Stanford will send to this contest de
pends upon the interest manifested
by students, so anyone interested in
any of the phases of the tournament
should attend the Debating Society
meeting tomorrow night," said Pro
fessor Gordon Emerson, debate
director.
The topics for extemporaneous
speaking will be drawn from the
field, "The United Nations in the
Postwar Period" and the impromptu
speeches will be on general current
topics.
