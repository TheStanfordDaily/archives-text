# Spanish Students Hold Sing Today
## 
### 
Cantemos todos. Donde y cuando?
In the Women's Clubhouse from 5
to 6 p.m., according to Dr. Roberto
B. Sangiorgi, director of Cantos
Espanoles.
This is not a new group; it was
organized this summer, having some
thirty permanent members. But it is
meeting this evening for the first
time this quarter, and everyone is
welcome.
The only pre-requisite is a genu
ine interest in Spanish; no knowl
edge of the songs or language is re
quired. For there will be booklets of
some of the most popular Spanish
and South American songs, and
everyone will learn them together.
Besides entertainment,. Cantos Es
panoles is designed to improve stu
dents' knowledge and pronunciation
of Spanish, and to teach them some
thing about the folklore of our Span
ish speaking neighbors. It offers, too,
an opportunity to meet others who
are equally interested in the lan
guage.
Dr. Sangiorgi is himself an enthu
siastic musician and a real scholar
in folklore music.
