There is no university credit involved when
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg speaks on Japan to
day at 2 p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse.
All that our everlastingly "busy" students 1
can obtain is a highly specialized knowledge
and understanding about one of the most chal
lenging problems in the world today.
Dr. Spiegelberg is going to discuss Japanese !
psychology as expressed in religious ritual. |
We may think that we can read all that we
want to know about Japanese psychology from
a newspaper or textbook—but Mr. Spiegelberg*
is prepared to offer the key to interpretation
and understanding to be inguiring student.
It is to the marked discredit of Stanford stu
dents that we neglect the opportunities which
busy Stanford professors offer generously to
obtain understanding of vital issues.
Professor Masland spoke on Japan last week.
Professor Graham Stuart spoke last night on
the State department. Both men, like Dr. Spie
gelberg, exceptionally well-gualified to speak, I
even among highest academic circles, did not
have anywhere near the student audience that
they deserve.
Let us not sit in the front row of the class- 1
room raising our hands furiously for three units
and then find the Women's Clubhouse too far
away when the real sincerity of our desire to
handle these problems is challenged.
Incidentally, in desperation the Y offers re- i
freshments. —Giannini.
