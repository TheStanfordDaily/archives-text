# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
Is that a General Sherman tank doing down
"Quad?" No, I guess it isn't; it's merely one
of the more rounded female figures stuffed,
and I mean literally "stuffed" into a pair of
jeans. This practice of wearing of "jeans" by
the coeds is becoming far too prevalent as far
as wearing them on the "Quad" is concerned.
This goes for slacks, also, so why don't you
get wise to yourselves, gals? It is in extreme
poor taste; besides, Stanford isn't Wellesley,
and I don't think that "Life" magazine will be
around to take your picture.
As this is the old "Bullsessioner's" cjlay f° r
complaining —what day isn't 1 wish to brinqf
up another subject.
Around the first part of December, the G. I.'s
of Stanford are planning .to throw the biggest
dance of their long and glorious history at this
university. Bringing an idea from Dartmouth's
famed "Winter Carnival," there will be a Stan
ford "rough" chosen as the "King of the Cam
pus." He will be surrounded at the dance by
a devy of beauties chosen from the various
women's living groups. The select group of
coeds will be called "princesses."
Here is where the hitch comes in. There
seems to be some trouble among the gals in
the houses when it comes to the picking of the
best looking of their group. Come now, gals!
Some got it; some ain't got it; so let's face it.
Hide your vanity and petty jealousies and get
into the spirit of the whole thing. Perhaps the
best solution in picking the princess in your
house would be to have a secret ballot.
There was no trouble in picking a candidate
for "King" among the men's living group,
which in my opinion, should be much harder
to do. The guys picked for "King" are very
apt to get ribbed a little over being selected; in
fact, they might get kicked around quite a bit,
but they are taking the chance, so I think the
least you gals can do is to help the whole idea
along.
The committee of soldiers in charge of this
dance are working like hell to put this dance
over, and as it will probably be the only big
one they ever put on here at Stanford, every
student on the campus should cooperate with
them in every way possible.

dance are working like hell to put this dance
over, and as it will probably be the only big
one they ever put on here at Stanford, every
student on the campus should cooperate with
them in every way possible.

Is that a General Sherman tank doing down
"Quad?" No, I guess it isn't; it's merely one
of the more rounded female figures stuffed,
and I mean literally "stuffed" into a pair of
jeans. This practice of wearing of "jeans" by
the coeds is becoming far too prevalent as far
as wearing them on the "Quad" is concerned.
This goes for slacks, also, so why don't you
get wise to yourselves, gals? It is in extreme
poor taste; besides, Stanford isn't Wellesley,
and I don't think that "Life" magazine will be
around to take your picture.
As this is the old "Bullsessioner's" cjlay f° r
complaining —what day isn't 1 wish to brinqf
up another subject.
Around the first part of December, the G. I.'s
of Stanford are planning .to throw the biggest
dance of their long and glorious history at this
university. Bringing an idea from Dartmouth's
famed "Winter Carnival," there will be a Stan
ford "rough" chosen as the "King of the Cam
pus." He will be surrounded at the dance by
a devy of beauties chosen from the various
women's living groups. The select group of
coeds will be called "princesses."
Here is where the hitch comes in. There
seems to be some trouble among the gals in
the houses when it comes to the picking of the
best looking of their group. Come now, gals!
Some got it; some ain't got it; so let's face it.
Hide your vanity and petty jealousies and get
into the spirit of the whole thing. Perhaps the
best solution in picking the princess in your
house would be to have a secret ballot.
There was no trouble in picking a candidate
for "King" among the men's living group,
which in my opinion, should be much harder
to do. The guys picked for "King" are very
apt to get ribbed a little over being selected; in
fact, they might get kicked around quite a bit,
but they are taking the chance, so I think the
least you gals can do is to help the whole idea
along.
The committee of soldiers in charge of this
dance are working like hell to put this dance
over, and as it will probably be the only big
one they ever put on here at Stanford, every
student on the campus should cooperate with
them in every way possible.
