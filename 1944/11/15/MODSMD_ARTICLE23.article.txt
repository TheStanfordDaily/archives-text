Just a friendly observation from a graduate student
who, though aware that the Daily is operating under
wartime handicaps, cannot understand:
1) Why the Daily does not devote a full column each
issue to worthwhile editorials rather than permitting
puerile offerings to usurp the space which tradition
ally is the editor's for candid, trenchant expression;
2). Why the Daily in these critical times ignores al
most completely pertinent editorial topics such as com
pulsory youth military training legislation, demobili
zation and youth adjustment plans, etc.
Editorial features have their place, but they should
be balanced with critical expressions of editorial opin
ion on timely campus and off-campus issues. This, it
would seem, is a better journalistic bill of fare in these
days.
Or does my observation bear a homiletic fragrance?
EUGENE DANAHER.
(Editor's Note: Reader Danaher should study the
Daily scriptures more carefully. With -7 issues this
quarter. 2!) editorials have been published, all candid,
most trenchant.)
