# THE 						AXE
## 
### 
To correct your editorial column of yesterday in
which you stated that Cardinals had changed jis mind
about bringing the Axe out at the Rally, I wish to say
that such a matter has never come up at Cardinal meet
ing for us to make up our minds one way or another.
The reporter consulted for his Monday story a mem
ber who knew nothing about the Rally or its program,
but one who attempted to aid the hurried journalist
who had many inches to fill.
Cardinals has tor ten years been the guardian of the
Axe and of Stanford and we fully realize
what the Axe stands for. Thanks ,to Bill Hornby for
explaining its tradition so clearly to the Dailv readers.
CHER I MARTIN HAMMOND,
President. Cardinals
