### BILL ADAMS 
The following epitaph was re
cently observed at the head of a
recently-dug grave behind the Daily
shack: Here lie a bunch of bums
who were called out on foul tips."
The tomb is rumored to contain five
Daily football eggsperts who died
during the Coast Guard Pilotsâ€”
C.O.P. last Saturday, which was won
by the sailors, 13 to 0. As this is an
occasion for great solemnity, all
humor is omitted. The experts' swan
song is herewith reverently printed.
Mort Cohen, champion to the last,
called 15 out of 20 the last week to
pass on to history a season average
of .720: Gordon Levy was the high
man for the final week, dying with
an average of .700: Bilge Adams got
14, passing away in a dead heat with
Levy for second in season averages;
Jimmy Weinberg, leader of the gang,
got 14 and expired with .GB6, and
Barney Gugel died as he had begun.
, never able to overcome the lead of
the other members, with .(>29. having
also called 14 right. On dark nights
Gugel's ghost may still be seen hov
ering around the publications build
ing and moaning tremulously, "It
couldn't happen."
