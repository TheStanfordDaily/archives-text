# Senior Barbecue Friday
## 
### 
Senior Excom, on behalf of the senior class, will give a barbecue supper
for the juniors at the 'Pit" by the boathouse this Friday evening from 5 to
7 p.m., preceding the all-campus rally.
"We'll have the barbecue rain or shine," said Betty Jean Calfee, senior
class president and chairman of this first junior-senior get-together of the
quarter. She added that everyone should wear jeans or old clothes.
The tentative menu includes hot dogs, salad, sandwiches, baked beans,
ice cream and milk, with part of the food being contributed by girls' halls
on the Row.
As cooks will be in demand, Miss Calfee asks that all those with or
without culinary experience, who would like to help cook beforehand, get
in touch with a member of senior Excom. Also the presidents of the
women's living groups should let Excom know about how many to expect
from each hall.
