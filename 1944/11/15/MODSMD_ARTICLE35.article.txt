# War's Effect Told by Stuart
## 
### 
"Although the most vital function
of the Department of State is the
maintenance of peaceful relations
between nations, paradoxically
enough, the Department has made
its greatest increases in functions and
personnel during periods of war,"
Dr. Graham Stuart last night told a
Tuesday Evening Series audience in
the auditorium of Memorial Hall.
The Stanford professor of political
science, recently returned from a
year's service with the State Depart
ment, gave many interesting illustra
tions of the wartime work of that de
partment.
Since the outbreak of World War
11, the State Department has more
than tripled its personnel and has
added many new divisions to han
dle wartime problems.
Many Stanford alumni and faculty
members are now playing important
administrative roles in the State De
partment. Among them are Dr.
Bernard Haley, Stanford economics
professor, who is head of the Office
of Economic Affairs; Dean Grayson
Kefauver of the School of Educa
tion, chairman pf the Commission on
International Education, and Dr.
David Harris, history professor, who
helped prepare the materials for dis
cussion at Dumbarton Oaks.
Dr. Stuart concluded his lecture
with a tribute to the fine work Sec
retary of State Cordell Hull has done
"to bring about reciprocal trade re
lations and political cooperation be
tween the nations of the world."
