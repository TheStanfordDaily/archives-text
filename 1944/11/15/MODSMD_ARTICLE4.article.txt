# Pre-Game Rally Friday
## 
### 
A revival of the traditional pre-game rallies is being planned for Friday
night, Emerson said. The Stanford band will leave Buchanan Hall at the
top of the Row at 7 p.m., preceded by the Sequoia-built coffin.
The procession, after going to Lagunita, will wind up at the basketball
pavilion, where Cardinals will conduct yells and songs. Ric Supple will
be cheer leader.
Then Dick Flint's German band will lead students up to the lake, where
a bonfire will have been built by the freshmen boys. This will be the first
bonfire since 1941. Frosh boys who have no classes Friday will turn out to
gather inflammables and build the frame, and freshmen girls from Roble
will serve them refreshments.
After the bonfire, there will be the regular Friday night dance in the
basketball pavilion.
