# SOME GOT IT, SOME AIN'T GOT IT

### 
Women's Conference, at a recent meeting, decided that it
would be fatal to something or other if Stanford women were
permitted to act as a court of honor at a coming campus dance.
The plan was to have one girl elected from within each living
group to act as representative for her house.
The exact purpose behind the Conference move is shrouded
in the mist of perfume and phosgene which surrounds their
somewhat autocratic meetings. However, one thing is certain:
this action met with disapproval from Stanford women when
the house presidents returned to tell their constituency of the
measures they had taken to protect them.
Of course, it is guite proper to show the world that we have
scholastic, intellectual, talented, or athletic women here, but
can't beauty and popularity be tolerated also?
Is it possible that a spirit of competition is dangerous, or that
Stanford women are too sophisticated to care whether or not
they are noticed?
As they say, some got it; some ain't got it.
And Women's Conference?
