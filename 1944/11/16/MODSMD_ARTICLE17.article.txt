# BULL SESSION
## 
### Dick Crane BLOSSOM PARKE 
(The pseudo "Big Game" is almost here, and so this week
Bull Session also is running something very special. As a treat
to all my readers, I am only writing the column three times.
You all know that "Cornelia Otis" Rush has enshrined her lit
erary talent forever in the hearts of all ftrst-quarter freshmen,
so to get a big rest before the game Saturday, I am having an
other guest writer for my column. The guest "bull-sessioner"
for the day will be Blossom Parke, one of the B. W. O. C.'s of
the campus. Famous for her surrealistic ideas, she has worked
herself into a veritable frenzy over the card stunts for the game
on Saturday, and to go on with the story—no, I guess I will let
her tell you about them. Go ahead, Blossom. I'm sure they will
try to understand.)

Well, here it is Autumn Quarter,
and football team or no football team
. . . once again the I.Q. of the Stan
ford students will be put to the cru
cial test in a card stunt rooting sec
tion. The fellow who makes the bet
next Saturday that there will be at
least one red card, two yellow cards
and three black cards in the first
tricks white field background,
should really get poor odds this year
. . . for to put it mildly, we really
have an unexperienced rooting sec
tion. All that can save us from
laughs across the way is that it will
prove true that the average intelli
gence here at Stanford is sufficient
to let one tell red from white, and
blue from gold.
Of course, even if you have this
much intelligence, there is always
the remote (over-used) possibility
that when your card says red . . .
you hold red up . . . right up so you
can see it in front of your own eyes
. . and when the gravel-throated
M.C. yells . . . hey you . . . seventh
row . . . red . . . red . . . not blue,
please. You smile to yourself . . .
don't check yourself . . . and just sit
there with your card up backwards
. . . Bless you all and one.
We can't overlook the people who
will be so excited that when they
first sit down they will untack their
.•aids . . . change seats a few times
before half-time , . . and then be
•onvinced they are going to do a
perfect job in the tricks. Then there
ire those who pass their instruction
•aids around, never ending up with
lu* same one.
The one the iv.rd stunt workers
> iIN Un e is Helpful l!an \ (.1 guess

we should throw a Mary in this year)
who says to his neighbor: "This just
can't be right . . . you're white . . .
you're white . . . and I'm red."
Thinking to himself how stupid the
markers were, he decides to help out
and hold up white too . . . Little does
he know he just took the horses's
eye ovit . . . We've checked, re
checked and double-checked each
color card with the seat number, so
please don't swap cards with your
neighbor because you like the colors
on his . . . and please hold up, facing
outward, the color your card says.
Above all, be careful of the cards.
They are not ours, and were loaned
to us especially for this game so that
we could have a card section. We
have to return every one of the color
cards after the game. So, if you are
of the mentality that you must have
something to tear and throw . , .
bring your own T. P.
Seriously, here are some sugges
tions that will help make our root
ing section be a big success.
1. Sit directly over your instruc
tion card that is tacked to the bench.
2. Do not untack instruction cards
from your seat until told to do so at
half-time.
3. W'hen you untack your card at
half-time, do not move from that
seat or exchange cards with anyone.
4. Do not judge what color j'ou
should have up by the color of the
person next to you . . . DO AS YOUR
CARD SAYS. '
5. Above all. LISTEN TO PERSON
GIVING DIRECTIONS AND FOL
LOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS.
G. See you S iturday . . . first ones
there got seats in the section.

. . . once again the I.Q. of the Stan
ford students will be put to the cru
cial test in a card stunt rooting sec
tion. The fellow who makes the bet
next Saturday that there will be at
least one red card, two yellow cards
and three black cards in the first
tricks white field background,
should really get poor odds this year
. . . for to put it mildly, we really
have an unexperienced rooting sec
tion. All that can save us from
laughs across the way is that it will
prove true that the average intelli
gence here at Stanford is sufficient
to let one tell red from white, and
blue from gold.
Of course, even if you have this
much intelligence, there is always
the remote (over-used) possibility
that when your card says red . . .
you hold red up . . . right up so you
can see it in front of your own eyes
. . and when the gravel-throated
M.C. yells . . . hey you . . . seventh
row . . . red . . . red . . . not blue,
please. You smile to yourself . . .
don't check yourself . . . and just sit
there with your card up backwards
. . . Bless you all and one.
We can't overlook the people who
will be so excited that when they
first sit down they will untack their
.•aids . . . change seats a few times
before half-time , . . and then be
•onvinced they are going to do a
perfect job in the tricks. Then there
ire those who pass their instruction
•aids around, never ending up with
lu* same one.

who says to his neighbor: "This just
can't be right . . . you're white . . .
you're white . . . and I'm red."
Thinking to himself how stupid the
markers were, he decides to help out
and hold up white too . . . Little does
he know he just took the horses's

checked and double-checked each
color card with the seat number, so
please don't swap cards with your
neighbor because you like the colors
on his . . . and please hold up, facing
outward, the color your card says.
Above all, be careful of the cards.
They are not ours, and were loaned
to us especially for this game so that
we could have a card section. We
have to return every one of the color
cards after the game. So, if you are
of the mentality that you must have
something to tear and throw . , .
bring your own T. P.
Seriously, here are some sugges
tions that will help make our root
ing section be a big success.
1. Sit directly over your instruc
tion card that is tacked to the bench.
2. Do not untack instruction cards
from your seat until told to do so at
half-time.
3. W'hen you untack your card at
half-time, do not move from that
seat or exchange cards with anyone.
4. Do not judge what color j'ou
should have up by the color of the
person next to you . . . DO AS YOUR
CARD SAYS. '
5. Above all. LISTEN TO PERSON

don't check yourself . . . and just sit

will be so excited that when they

who says to his neighbor: "This just
can't be right . . . you're white . . .
you're white . . . and I'm red."
Thinking to himself how stupid the
markers were, he decides to help out
and hold up white too . . . Little does
he know he just took the horses's
eye ovit . . . We've checked, re
checked and double-checked each
color card with the seat number, so
please don't swap cards with your
neighbor because you like the colors
on his . . . and please hold up, facing
outward, the color your card says.
Above all, be careful of the cards.
They are not ours, and were loaned
to us especially for this game so that
we could have a card section. We
have to return every one of the color
cards after the game. So, if you are
of the mentality that you must have
something to tear and throw . , .
bring your own T. P.
Seriously, here are some sugges
tions that will help make our root
ing section be a big success.
1. Sit directly over your instruc
tion card that is tacked to the bench.
2. Do not untack instruction cards
from your seat until told to do so at
half-time.
3. W'hen you untack your card at
half-time, do not move from that
seat or exchange cards with anyone.
4. Do not judge what color j'ou
should have up by the color of the
person next to you . . . DO AS YOUR
CARD SAYS. '
5. Above all. LISTEN TO PERSON

LOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS.

(The pseudo "Big Game" is almost here, and so this week
Bull Session also is running something very special. As a treat
to all my readers, I am only writing the column three times.
You all know that "Cornelia Otis" Rush has enshrined her lit
erary talent forever in the hearts of all ftrst-quarter freshmen,
so to get a big rest before the game Saturday, I am having an
other guest writer for my column. The guest "bull-sessioner"
for the day will be Blossom Parke, one of the B. W. O. C.'s of
the campus. Famous for her surrealistic ideas, she has worked
herself into a veritable frenzy over the card stunts for the game
on Saturday, and to go on with the story—no, I guess I will let
her tell you about them. Go ahead, Blossom. I'm sure they will
try to understand.)

Well, here it is Autumn Quarter,
and football team or no football team
. . . once again the I.Q. of the Stan
ford students will be put to the cru
cial test in a card stunt rooting sec
tion. The fellow who makes the bet
next Saturday that there will be at
least one red card, two yellow cards
and three black cards in the first
tricks white field background,
should really get poor odds this year
. . . for to put it mildly, we really
have an unexperienced rooting sec
tion. All that can save us from
laughs across the way is that it will
prove true that the average intelli
gence here at Stanford is sufficient
to let one tell red from white, and
blue from gold.
Of course, even if you have this
much intelligence, there is always
the remote (over-used) possibility
that when your card says red . . .
you hold red up . . . right up so you
can see it in front of your own eyes
. . and when the gravel-throated
M.C. yells . . . hey you . . . seventh
row . . . red . . . red . . . not blue,
please. You smile to yourself . . .
