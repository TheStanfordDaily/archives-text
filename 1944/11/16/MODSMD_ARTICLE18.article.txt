# OUR HASHER

### JOE SHER 
The Senior and Junior class is on
its way to (no. not there; they could
not stand the heat) a big fry, at the
barbecue pit, where the lone rem
nants of the Senior class are prepar
ing a feast for the little group of
about three hundred and fifty.
Under the direction of B. J. Calfee,
Senior Class president, and her com
mittee, extensive plans have been
laid for food, fun and free drinks, to
say nothing of a program of Junior
and Senior talent.
The food is being prepared under
the direction of that virtuoso of the
griddle, John "Partytime" Mathew
son, who has had years of experience
cooking up things. Mr. Mathewson
says, and we quote, "The food will
be ris korjkl kujho (spelled back
wards, is hot dogs)."
All during the meal everyone will
have fun. First, We'll get a big laugh
while thousands of people trample
all over us trying to get in line first.
Then, when we do get the food, we
will, just convulse (and I mean this
literally) ourselves trying to balance
it as we go over to our comfortable
seat on the cold, cold and damn
damp ground.
Then of course we will sit for a
while longer as a bunch of frustrated
Bob Hopes try to regale us with an
cient jokes and community singing.
However, the little group is sure to
laugh and have a good time. What
gluttons for punishment!
Here is your chance. Seniors, to go
to a class function and for all of the
Juniors to gloat over their superior
numbers. "More 4-F's, that's all."
Newest nominee for the exalted
position of the Snowball King is that
campus character John "Curly-
Locks" Sinai, better known as
"SIGH" (don't swoon girls). "SIGH,"
who has served time in the Navy, is
very experienced in court and is a
fitting rival to the "Phantom," and
the "Long Barn Lothario."
The response of certain of the
women's living groups to the sugges
tions of the Army committee for the
Snowball and their cooperation in
electing princesses to serve in the
"King's Court," is terrific and only
an indication of the cooperation of
the swell women on this campus.
Wtih such enthusiasm and spirit, I
am sure the Army lads will put on a
dance that will long be remembered
on this campus.
Gripe of the week: In days of yore
when gas was plentiful (this is prob
ably before yore time) a Stanford
man or woman never went any place
without a full car, nor did he or she
ever fail to pick up anyone walking
or even looking like he wanted a
ride. Now that gas is a little harder
to get and cars are less plentiful, it
has been the attitude of many a stu
dent to let a person walk if he didn't
know him. Well, what the hell, no
Stanford student ever needed a for
mal introduction to give another a
lift. Without any of the old rah, rah,
let's get together and if we see any
one on old Wilson's corner waiting
for the little green, let's stop and
see if they are going our way.
Wanted: One feature writer at the
Daily office who can fill his column
with something besides stubbies, the
econ. dept., and our hasher. Need
have no experience in writing or be
able to be funny. Position to be filled
is Dull Session.
