There is a rumor going around
(and it seems to be a very substan
tial rumor) that the Thundering
Herd is once more on the loose and
that the memories of Cotton War
burton, Grenny Lansdale, Harry
Smith and P. Ambrose Schindler
will once again be kindled in the
hearts of all those who can remem
ber the giants of USC. For when
the Trojans come up to Berkeley this
Saturday, they will bring up with
them one of the strongest teams in
their history, a team currently
ranked as number 11 in the nation.
According to Dick Nash, expo
nent of Trojan publicity, they have a
very well-balanced team, possessing
both speed and weight. On top of
that, Jim Hardy is the best passer
in their history, having completed 41
passes out of 78. seven of these being
touchdown passes. The previous rec
ord was held by Doyle Nave, the
third string quarterback who made
football history a few years back
when he completed three straight
passes in the last minute of play to
dump a Duke team that was unde
feated, untied, and unscored upon,
7-3.
The loss of Gordon Gray, USC's
best running back, and Marshall
Roemer, first-string tackle, were the
only serious blows. Replacing these
boys are Milford Dreblow, a flashy
runner who showed great promise
earlier in the season, and John Pe
har, 6 - foot, 7 1 2 - inch, 284 - pound
giant.
To combat this, the Bears have a
great center, Roger Harding; a de
termined line, and one of the best
climax runners on the coastâ€”Joe
Stuart. The outlook for Cal is dis
mal. but the Bears were two and

one-half underdogs the last time
they met the Trojan, and USC was
lucky to get out with a (>-(5 tie.
Six of the men who were in on
that great game will be missing
from the lineup, however. Among
them are Bill Hachten and Dick
Madigan, ex-Stanford guards and
candidates for ail-American. The
credit for the surprising showing of
California in the beginning of the
season goes to these two boys, plus
Harding.
We don't like to Rive Stub Allison
advice, but if Stuart doesn't handle
the ball more often, Cal doesn't
stand a ghost of a chance of win
ning. He has been the only con
sistent ground gainer. Stuart's run
ning back of punts is also Cal's best
offensive threat.
The winner of this struggle will
probably be Rose Bowl bound. We'll
be seeing you at 2:30 in the Califor
nia Memorial Stadium.
