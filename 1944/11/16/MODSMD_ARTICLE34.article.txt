Students crowded into the "Y"
room of the Women's Clubhouse yes
terday at 2 p.m. to hear Dr. Frederic
Spiegelberg, instructor in Humani
ties, speak on "Japanese National
ism."
The Japanese, he said, consider it
their duty as a superior nation to
preserve world peace and promote
the humanity of man.
Descended From Gods
Japan is the only nation on earth
which has maintained one dynasty
throughout the millenium of its his
tory; which, according to a national
legend, is descended directly from
the gods. The people believe this and
cannot distinguish between reality
and imagination. This inability to
recognize fact has contributed great
ly to their extreme nationalism.
This superiority complex has de
veloped from an inferior idea which
springs largely from the fact that
most Japanese culture is derived
from the Chinese civilization. Thus,
the early wars with China were
fought more for psychological than
economic reasons, and, similarly, the
Japanese are fighting this war to
again establish their superiority.
Lack of Individuality
Another national charactristice is
their lack of individuality. "In Ja
pan," said Dr. Spiegelberg, "the en
tire student body would have turned
out after the editorial in this morn
ing's Daily," A personal conscious
ness of individual personality has not
yet been developed in Japan, he
added.
"A third national characteristic of
the Japanese," said Dr. Spiegelberg,
is their cruelty, which should be
called their 'detachment attitude'."
The Japanese believe that everything
is of divine origin and that cruelty
and kindness are alike. Their cruelty
is due partly to the suppression of
emotion in themselves, and thus the
disregard of it in others.
