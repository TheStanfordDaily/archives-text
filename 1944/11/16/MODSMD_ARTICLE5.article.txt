## 
### 
* PARIS. Nov. 15 (U.R) â€”Seizing three
! more forts in Metz's belt of concrete
| and iron, U. S. infantrymen swarm
ed to the top of Pouilly Ridge only
one mile from the city today against
fierce resistance from reinforced
German rearguards attempting to
hold open an evacuation gap from
the great French bastion.
Along a 200-mile front, from the
bogs of eastern Holland, where Brit
ish troops cracked through a Ger
man outer line before the Maas, to
the Vosges, where the Allies crowd
ed into the mountain passes, a gen
eral retirement behind the Seigfried
Line seemed to be the enemy's order
of the day.
