# HIT 'EM AGAIN, HARD!
## 
### 
Berkeley stadium can well guake on its foun
dation when over a thousand football-starved
'Injuns" bring their pent-up battle cries to the
USC-Cal game tomorrow.
Farm rooters in their days of legitimate par
ticipation in the play at Berkeley were known
as a blase lot who hardly lifted an eyebrow
when their all-Americans performed. But now
things are different and the fallen game has
taken on an aura of ancestor worship, around
here.
The problem of tomorrow's section leaders
will be to keep the boundless enthusiasm of
the Farm concentrated on the game, and not on
pointless agitation.
Despite the $1.40 plus t&x which is nice in
anybody's coffer, we will be guests at tomor
row's festivities, but more important, we are
representing a university with a great reputa
tion on the gridiron, whose team will be back
in Berkeley's Memorial Stadium probably while
most of us are still at school. Tomorrow we will
represent an important part of Stanford sports,
nevertheless—Sportsmanship.
It takes concentration and sense to make the
card stunts, prepared at great effort for us, ef
fective. Sportsmanship should dictate the scope
of our "fun" at the game.
Let's have no slackening in the calibre of
our play even though we do not field a team.
—Giannini.
