# HAVE A BIKE?
## 
### 
If you own a bicycle—or even one of our
campus reasonable facsimiles—please take a
hint from the "Paly" Police! They think it would
be a good idea for you to invest 50 cents in a
bicycle license, and we heartily agree with
them!
No, it isn't required that you have a license to
ride your bike on the Farm, but if you venture
into "Paly" (as most of us do), city law requires
a license; otherwise, the police will impound
your bicycle.
Here's what that 50 cents buys. A sturdy li
cense plate sealed to your bicycle by an of
ficer, a handy identification card, and a com
plete description of your bike to be filed at
Police Headquarters in case your bicycle is lost
or stolen.
Need some proof for your investment? A
Stanford student left his licensed bicycle locked
last Saturday night to the stand at the Palo Alto
Southern Pacific Depot. Returning Sunday af
ternoon, he found it missing. Three hours after
reporting it stolen, to the "Paly" police, they
phoned him at Toyon and said they had recov
ered it—intact! Luckily, the student had pur
chased a license a few days previously!
The Palo Alto Police, like Dunninger, don't
:laim to be 100 per cent perfect. But it is a fact
that most of the licensed stolen or lost bicycles
ire recovered. The percentage of unlicensed
oicycle recovery is much less!
When you report your bike stolen, a complete
description is given to each Paly" patrol car.
Tney are constantly on the lookout for it.
No, it isn't required, but we suggest, for safe

Bicycles are -scarce and expensive; licenses,
plentiful and nominal in cost. Besides, it's an
excellent way to get acguainted with the "Paly"
Police! —Bill Eileis.
