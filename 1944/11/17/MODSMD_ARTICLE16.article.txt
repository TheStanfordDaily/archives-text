Nostalgia fills the thoughts of the old stu
dents —memories of Del Monte, big party time,
and a winning football team. To the new stu
dents, a hope that all of these wonderful things
may again come to the Stanford campus before
they graduate.
This is the big week-end of the fall guarter,
and activities start off tonight with the big rally.
Headlining the program at the rally will be the
great Sergeant Casey, long a tradition of the
"Farm." I could expound for hours on the
merits of the great Casey, but he is much more
gualified to tell you than I so be sure and attend
this evening. You will certainly get something
new in Stanford tradition. Ric Supple will lead
songs and cheers—something different. It is
rumored that "The Pelt" will stumble through a
little forced comedy. I guess Sher will be at the
barbecue instead of the rally, but I can't be sure,
because so many things are going on.
On Saturday morning, a mass exodus of stu
dents will be trudging up Berkeley way to see
the massacre. This is merely an opinion of your
columnist. Whether it is or isn't a good football
game makes little difference, as everyone is
going, so everyone has to go to stay in the "in
group," and I guote. There will be card stunts,
the Stanford band will give out with its best
music, and in general, a very good time. All
the "roughs" of the campus will have to discard
thoose wool plaid shirts during the game, but
you will be able to wear them up there at least.
If you don't want to carry them around for the
afternoon, I imagine most of them will be able
to hitch-hike home all by themselves.
After the game, everyone is urged to return
to Stanford and attend the Lagunita - Union
dance. It says formal on the signs, but it really
isn't in one sense of the word. The gals are
reguired to wear formals, but all men attending
have the choice of wearing either a "tux" or a
business suit. Another thing pertinent about the
dance is the fact that it is rumored to be a girls'
bid, but if you have to "dangle to the rhythm of
the waltz," and no gal has asked you to go,
don't be a wallflower, call up your dream gal
and ask her to go.
The committee for the dance wants everyone
to come, so call her up. If you can 'c'hintz" her
into taking you so much the better; if you have
to go "dutch treat," that still isn't so bad. If
things are so tough that you have to pay her
way, be sure and take her anyway, because it
will be a dance you won't want to miss.
I want all of you to benet by a little expe
rience of mine, so please take heed.
One Saturday last spring guarter, my room
mate and I took a couple of gals up to the Palace
Hotel for a little "wining and dining." We went
into the "Rose Room," danced twice, drank two
Scotch and sodas apiece, whereupon the waiter
handed us a check for 515.74. See you all back
here at the dance.

new in Stanford tradition. Ric Supple will lead
songs and cheers—something different. It is
rumored that "The Pelt" will stumble through a
little forced comedy. I guess Sher will be at the
barbecue instead of the rally, but I can't be sure,
because so many things are going on.
On Saturday morning, a mass exodus of stu
dents will be trudging up Berkeley way to see
the massacre. This is merely an opinion of your
columnist. Whether it is or isn't a good football
game makes little difference, as everyone is
going, so everyone has to go to stay in the "in
group," and I guote. There will be card stunts,
the Stanford band will give out with its best
music, and in general, a very good time. All
the "roughs" of the campus will have to discard
thoose wool plaid shirts during the game, but
you will be able to wear them up there at least.
If you don't want to carry them around for the
afternoon, I imagine most of them will be able
to hitch-hike home all by themselves.
After the game, everyone is urged to return
to Stanford and attend the Lagunita - Union
dance. It says formal on the signs, but it really
isn't in one sense of the word. The gals are
reguired to wear formals, but all men attending
have the choice of wearing either a "tux" or a
business suit. Another thing pertinent about the
dance is the fact that it is rumored to be a girls'
bid, but if you have to "dangle to the rhythm of
the waltz," and no gal has asked you to go,
don't be a wallflower, call up your dream gal
and ask her to go.
The committee for the dance wants everyone
to come, so call her up. If you can 'c'hintz" her
into taking you so much the better; if you have
to go "dutch treat," that still isn't so bad. If
things are so tough that you have to pay her
way, be sure and take her anyway, because it
will be a dance you won't want to miss.
I want all of you to benet by a little expe
rience of mine, so please take heed.
One Saturday last spring guarter, my room
mate and I took a couple of gals up to the Palace
Hotel for a little "wining and dining." We went
into the "Rose Room," danced twice, drank two
Scotch and sodas apiece, whereupon the waiter
handed us a check for 515.74. See you all back
here at the dance.
Nostalgia fills the thoughts of the old stu
dents —memories of Del Monte, big party time,
and a winning football team. To the new stu
dents, a hope that all of these wonderful things
may again come to the Stanford campus before
they graduate.
This is the big week-end of the fall guarter,
and activities start off tonight with the big rally.
Headlining the program at the rally will be the
great Sergeant Casey, long a tradition of the
"Farm." I could expound for hours on the
merits of the great Casey, but he is much more
gualified to tell you than I so be sure and attend
this evening. You will certainly get something
new in Stanford tradition. Ric Supple will lead
songs and cheers—something different. It is
rumored that "The Pelt" will stumble through a
little forced comedy. I guess Sher will be at the
