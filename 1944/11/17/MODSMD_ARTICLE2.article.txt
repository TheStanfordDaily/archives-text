# Junior-Senior Barbecue Held Tonight at Pit
## 
### 
Juniors, seniors, tonight's the
night of the big barbecue at the
"pit" where some 350 upperclassmen
are expected to get together for a
big partytime from 5 to 7. To quote
Joe Sher, master of ceremonies,
there will be lots of "food, fun and
free drinks" and even some tal
ented entertainers.
The entertainment which remains
somewhat of a mystery will include
a trio of seniors and a quartet of
juniors harmonizing on some of the
favorites, community singing and
some "Bob Hopes" to keep things
from getting dull.
Chief chef, Bob Mathewson, with
his crew will be there turning out
hot dogs and hot dogs, and ten
senior and ten junior servers will
pile your plates with salad, baked
beans, ice cream and sandwiches.
The members of Senior Excom

committees are: Barbara Jean Cal
fee .and Barbara Burroughs, co
chairmen; Pat Tapscott and Betty
Kenny, food; Bob De Mott, arrange
ments, and Joe Sher, entertainment.
Old clothes or jeans should be
worn to the barbecue.
