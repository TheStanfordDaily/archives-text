# Story of the Daily---53 Colorful Years
## 
### NADA SKIDMORE 
Yesterday a prewar graduate re
visited the Stanford Daily Shack.
She commented on the absence of
United Press teletype machines,
the faded yellow "Gruf Board."
the addition of two filing cabinets.
Yet, the wartime changes which
she saw are temporary, not perma
nent blocks to progress.
This is the fifty-fourth year that
a student newspaper has been pub
lished on this campus. Daily staff
members can find in those 53 years
a heritage of contributions from men
and women whose success within the
green-walled Daily Shack continued
in their careers after graduation.
Here is the Daily's history and their
listory.
Early Years
On the opening day of the Univer
sity, October 1, 1891, a small, four
column periodical was distributed to
students and faculty. Holbrook
Blinn, stage actor noted for his inter
pretation of "The Bad Man," was the
first editor of the publication. Named
"The Palo Alto," it was emblazoned
with the motto, "For, of, to, with,
and by the students."
Editor Blinn commented in an edi
torial, "The Palo Alto is, we believe,
the only college paper ever started
simultaneously with the opening of a
great university."
Merger with Cal
During spring of 1892 the Stanford
editors joined with the University of
California in producing the paper
until "the union became so objec
tionable that it was discontinued."
But under the name of The Daily
Palo Alto, the publication returned
to the campus on September 19 and
Stanford became the eighth univer
sity in the United States having a
daily student-published paper. A
four-column, afternoon paper with

archaic makeup, the Daily Palo Alto
was printed here in the University
woodworking shop after the first ten
issues had been taken to a Redwood
City press.
Prominent ex-Editors
During these decades the editor's
chair was occupied by many stu
dents who became prominent alumni
after graduation.
Will Irwin, famous author and war
correspondent of the first World War,
in 1897 was one of the early editors.
He wrote several books, including
"The City That Was," story of San
Francisco in the 1906 earthquake;
"A Reporter in Armageddon," and
an autobiography of Herbert Hoover.
The long list includes J. T. Nourse,
editor in 1900, now a judge in the
California district court of appeals;
W. H. B. Fowler, '05 editor, former
assistant publisher and general man
ager of the San Francisco Chronicle;
Preston B. Delano, '07, cousin of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and con
troller of currency; Graeme Howard,
'16, vice-president of- General Mo
tors; W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10. president
of the Board of Trustees. Thousands
of readers follow the column which
E. C. (Squire) Behrens, '14, writes
regularly as political editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Meanwhile, students had found a
new nickname, "The Dippy," for the
fast-progressing daily. A column was
added in 1914, '20 and '25, and in 1926
the eighth column boosted the pub
lication to the size of most city news
papers and the old Daily Palo Alto
was renamed The Stanford Daily.
Further improvements of the Daily
Annex to the Press Building were
recorded for $3,381.29 in 1935-36.
"An inner wall and ceiling have
been installed (in the Daily Shack)
insuring warmth and dryness to the
staff," an article stated in the first
issue of the new Stanford Daily.

Attendance at staff meetings imme
diately jumped to a higher percent
age.
The list of well-known Daily edi
tors grew as the following made
their appearance:
Neil Petree, '19. editor, president
of the Stanford Alumni Association
and president of Barker Bros, in Los
Angeles; W. F. (Bill) Leiser, '21, now
editing the sports page of the San
Francisco Chronicle; Kenneth M.
Stuart, '23. national affairs editor of
the New York tabloid PM; T. R.
Letz, '33, secretary to Mayor Roger
Lapham of San Francisco, and Stan
ley Beaubaire, '34, publisher of the
Hanford Sentinel.
Still in the Business
Numerous Daily editors of the last
ten years have continued in news
paper work, although many are now
in the Service. Among those editing
the paper during the '30's are:
Robert L. Jones, '35, editor of the
Vallejo News (now in the Service);
Millard C. Browne, '36, editorial
writer on the Buffalo Evening News;
Harry Sheldon, '39, news editor of
Business Week (now U.S.N. Lt.);
Robert Eisenbaeh, editor in '37, was
working for NBC and put the Pearl
Harbor announcement on the air in
December, 1941.
One father-son and one father
daughter combination of editors are
recorded in the Daily files. Ben C.
Dey and Alfred A. Hampson edited
the paper in 1804-'O5; later became
law partners and now represent
Southern Pacific, Dey in San Fran
cisco and Hampson in Portland, Ore.
In 1943, A. A. Hampson, Jr., was
elected editor of the Daily in his
senior year.
Ellen Calhoun, daughter of Scott
Calhoun, Seattle lawyer who was
Daily editor in 1895, in 1920 became
the first elected woman editor, and
the only daughter of a former editor.

I Ruth Taylor edited the paper in
! 1918, after elected editor W. I. Ames :
' joined the Service.
Women in There, Too
'
The Daily has also fostered talent
| ed women journalists, among them
former women's editor ('37) Anna
Lee Whitmore Jacoby, wife of the
late Melville Jacoby and now in
India for Time magazine. Others in
clude Suzanne Hammond, '38' man
aging editor, employed by Life in
New York City, and Margaret Loud,
'38, women's editor who married '37
Stanford graduate C. S. Jackson, Jr.,
of the Jackson family publishing The
Oregon Journal.
Daily Traditions
While night editors strove to
achieve startling makeup effects, the
late "Charlie" Wegner, for 20 years
the Daily floorman in the backshop j
j of the University Press, became one
of the Daily's traditions. He worked
from November of 1923 to his death
j in 1943,
Wartime has postponed many old- ,
time Daily traditions and changed
its organization. The size was cut j
to a five-column tabloid in 1943, al
though the Daily endeavors to re- j
tain pre-war standards. Dr. Chilton
K. Bush, head of the journalism de- |
i partment. has commented:
"Although the Daily, on both the
editorial and business sides, is oper
ated without faculty supervision, it
! is as well edited as any daily in the
country, managed as efficiently as
] any other daily, and is in better
i taste than most."
