# Grad Writes 'Timber Beast'
## 
### 
The Timber Boast by Archie
Binns, Stanford alumnus, published
by Charles Scribner's Sons, is n
story about the Nortliwest by a
promising contemporary author that
ought to be widely read. In the
vernacular, it has everything; fast
moving plot, convincing characters
superb background, and even a brief
mention of Stanford.
It is more than just the story of
old Charlie Dow, "the timber beast,'
his lovely young wife, Marian, and
his sons. Bailey and Paul; it is alsc
the story of logging.
Logging is the theme running
through the whole book, a realistic
overtone to the comfortable lives ol
the men who run the business, re
minding them always that there are
other men who live dangerously for
them. Logging, the directing fate ol
the men who work at it, has all the
force of a major character in the
book.
Archie Binns writes dramatically
about the business of logging, and
yet there are scenes in the book thai
are almost poetry, such as Marian's;
first meeting with Paul. Above all,
he writes with a vitality, an under
standing of youth, that is not philo
sophical but friendly.â€”Knox
