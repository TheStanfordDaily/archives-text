# Cottrell Discusses Postwar Organization
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
"Thcrc is little doubt about the
form of postwar organization," said
Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, dean of the
School of Social Sciences and exe
cutive head of the Department of
Political Science. "It will closely
follow the Dumbarton Oak pro
posals."
First will be the Security Council,
a small, compact group, entrusted
with keeping world peace. The five
or six major powers will probably
be permanent members, together
with an equal number of temporary
ones chosen from the smaller
countries.
Under the Security Council will be
a general assembly which will event
ually include all the nations, first the
Allies, later the neutral countries,
and finally the belligerents. Inter
national regulation will be its job.
Power the Issue
The big issue then, will be not
the form of organization, but rather
the amount of power to be delegated
to it, especially to the Security Coun
cil. Obviously, it must have force
to back its decrees, or it will fail just
as the League of Nations did during
the Manchurian and Ethiopian inva
sions. Both might have been stopped
A the League had had an interna
tional police force to go into quick
action.
The new world organization can
not have another Article X, for it
was that article in the League of
Nations covenant that gave the dele
gates power to advise, but not to act
tor peace. Each delegate had to con
sult his government before taking
action.
War-Making Power
The issue will be greatest in the

United States, where the Constitu
tion reserves to Congress the right to
declare war. Does the proposal de
prive it of this traditional preroga
tive? An international security sys-

tem would make it possible to deal
with potential or threatened aggres
sions at an early stage, when the lim
ited forces made available for inter
national enforcement might be suf
ficient.
The principle is much like that of
the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. It does not have to go to Con
gress to get permission to act, but
can go ahead as it thinks best. Thus
it avoids a great deal of time-con
suming red tape, and is very effec
tive. But Congress may be unwilling
to entrust such great powers to a

delegate at the Security Council.
Schools of Thought
There are several schools of
thought. Some believe that no con
cert of foreign powers should be
allowed to make final decisions on
sending American forces into action;
that it would be better to give this
power to the President.
The participation by the United
States in an international security
organization would not change the
situation from that which has always
prevailed. The President has always
had the power under the Constitu
tion to use force when he deemed it
necessary to protect American citi
zens abroad; to prevent the invasion
of the territory, or to suppress insur
rectionpand such action has some
times preceded war.
Others say that such power is too
great to entrust to any one man,

either our representative or the
President.
15)151 vs. 15)44
The same arguments were used in
1915). The main difference is that
now all political parties are pledged
to U. S. participation in the proposed
international machinery to preserve
peace.
The policy has been accepted, but
the methods seem vague and perhaps
unworkable. It is upon these meth
ods that the fight will come. Will
another Article X arise to block
world peace?
The plan of the Dumbarton Oaks
conferees does not rob Congress of
its ultimate sovereignity, for con
gressional supervision will always be
present. Control will be possible
through the power of the purse, for
the armed forces will be dependent
on Congress's financial support. And

only Congress will have the power
of declaring war.
The President, as commander-in
chief and head of the executive de
partment of government, has power
under the Constitution and standing
legislation to employ the armed
forces for protection of the United
States citizens or agencies abroad;
for the defense of the territory of
the United States, and for the pre
vention of offenses against the law
of nations of violations of treaties.
This power of the President is dis
tinguished from the power of Con
gress to declare war.
"Can we not lose the peace, as in
ISI9, by quibbling oh details?" asked
Dr. Cottrell. "We can and probably
will, if we scuttle the Dumbartonf
Oaks proposals before they have the
full light of public opinion and legis
lative discussion."
