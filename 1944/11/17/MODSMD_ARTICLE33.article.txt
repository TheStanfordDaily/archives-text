# Veteran Problem To Be Discussed
## 
### 
Adjustments and attitudes of re
turning service men will be the topic
of Dr. Gretchen Ann Magaret's talk
Monday at 7 p.m. at the Memorial
Auditorium for all women on
campus. This talk, formerly given
for the "Y" War Social Adjustments
group, is being sponsored by Wom
en's Conference under the direction
of Chairman Sally Breuner.
Dr. Magaret will outline some of
trends in behavior to be expected
.iom these men â€”qualities of hostil
ity, uncertainty, loss of self-esteem,
so-called combat residuals, and
worry caused by disruption of fam
ily relationships.
Dr. Magaret advises complete, sin
cere acceptance of the individual,
whether or not his attitude seems
shocking, irritating, frightening, dull,
or unpleasant.
Value of such a talk is exceedingly
great, according to "Y" Secretary
Nancy Banning, for women arc en
countering many instances of malad
justment in men returning from the
fronts, and these instances will be
come more and more numerous fiom
now on.
House meetings, regularly sched
uled for Monday nights, will be post
poned so that all women may have
the opportunity to attend.
