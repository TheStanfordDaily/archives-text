### BILL ADAMS 
In the dank and gloomy twilight,
five eerie spirits hovered mistily
around the Daily Shack yesterday
night, moaning and wailing in uni
son, "It shouldn't happen to a
ghost." On this assumption, the
spirits of the mighty staff of football
experts decided to give it one more
chance before they "gave up the
ghost." Reformed, alas, too late,
Barney Gugel predicted in a hum
bler "spirit," stringing along with
the rest of the ghouls on most of the
contests of the week. Among the
others present were recognizable a
shadowy grinning figure faintly rem
iniscent of Jim Weinberg; a pale,
anemic spirit suggesting Gordo Levy;
a tall, dark, foreboding figure re
minding one of Mort Cohen, and a
tiny, ignominious leprechaun whom
the others addressed as "Bilge."
After an hour's shadowy, silent
session, the following warning was
found written in blood on the Wall:
Pacific Coast
USC to disappoint the Farm crowd,
running over Cal by 13. Gugel's
ghoul made the specific stipulation
that it would be by 40 if dry, by 19
if Stub Allison follows his usual
practice of wetting down the field
before the game.
Second Air Force over Washington
by 7, with a "spirit" of union px-e
-vailing among the egg-sperts.
UCLA over COP by 14. Bruins
are getting better at those conver
sions.
St. Marys PF to beat Fleet City
by 12.
March Field over San Diego Navy
by 7. Service championship of the
country at stake.

Southwest
Texas A & M to beat Rice by 7,
