## 
### 
This fall's big-time campus variety
show, complete with sparkling songs,
hilarious skits, delightful dances,
and everything else which makes a
musical success; will hit the Memo

rial Auditorium December 1 and 2.
Tickets will sell at $1.25, $1, 85 cents,
and 55 cents.
"Dimes for Diplomas," the drive
which took place at all house meet
ings last year, will be aided this year
by the profits of Gaieties. Return
ing servicemen and women major
ing in dramatics will find scholar
ships awaiting them.
Director of this year's Ram's Head
production is Peggy Fitts. Janice
Shaughnessy is assistant director,
and Corky Wollman is in charge of
the technical details.
Original songs are to be featured
in the production by singers Jackie
Cannon, Bob Gettys, Herb Wilson,
Leslie Alexander, and Bi Rice.
Leslie Alexander penned the
show's opener, and also wrote "The
Color Is Blue." Marty Klein came
through with "Just for You," and
Bob Eckstein produced a new "Mar
gie."
Dannie Hughes wrote one of the
show's hits, "If I Could Only Write
a Song," and Joan Green developed
two tunes guaranteed to send the
crowd away humming, "Blue Inter
lude" and "Reminiscing."
"Body by Fisher," by Amie Rei
chert afid Jan Bradbury Mieners;
"Ten Bucks and Twenty-four Hours
Leave," by Claude Wilson; and "Out
Stepping," by Brownlee Corrin and
Judy Pope, will also be ample evi
dence for the existence of Stanford
talent.
