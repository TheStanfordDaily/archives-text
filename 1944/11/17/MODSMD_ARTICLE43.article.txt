# AST Echoes

### T. BERRY 
It has become my apparent duty
to point out to all in general and no
one in particular that certain Pre-
Meds of Company C (who do not
wear a yellow square under their
AST patch) wish me to mention the
various anatomical (and legal) ad
vantages of being a Pre-Med. Hav
ng a professorized mind, I shall pro
ceed to syllogize, chronologize, al
phabetize, the following information
concerning ERC'S and Pre-Meds:
ERC'S
Better: Old enough to know
Seldom shave
Claim Pre-Meds have all cash
Some (what) immature
Will be here next term!
Full complement of hair and teeth
Legally not allowed to—
Lovable little loboes* (usually
travel in packs)
*Lobo; in Western U. S., a timber
wolf.
Pre-Meds
Better: Knows (but ignores)
Seldom shave either, but should —
Claims vice-versa
Maturely merging into senility
Going, going, gone.
Damn that Supply Sergeant!
Legally legal
Just loboes (travel alone).

"Millionaires Row" (fifth floor)
has at long last been broken up.
Last weekend the inhabitants were
moved from their private (no pun
intended) rooms to more spacious
rooms on the fourth and third floors.
They now have the added fortune
or misfortune of roommates. If you
are a dominant character (like a
PFC) and can get your roommate
to clean your room it is a fortunate
situation. Or perhaps he has money
(this is too much to hope for!) Then
he may have ready contact with
quite a few young women whose
fathers are Hollywood "yes" men.
This last statement is from the book
entitled: Heredity KO's Environ
ment.
Noticeable feature of the room
shuffle found Fletcher and Farrell,
the politicians, quartered together;
and the two most notorious expo
nents of "How to get a room in a
mess and keep it there" (Everett
Jenne and A 1 Horr) sharing a room.

Because he complained when some
winsome Stanford lasses kept him
out after "chow call," Thomas Castle
was the recipient (in true Stanford
tradition) of a very brightly multi-
Crosby-colored tie for his "lockout."
The tie is a knockout for a lockout.
Combined with that military brown
it gives out with an odor simulating
the smell of eggs long fertile. Castle
intends to wear this atrocity at his
"coming out" party in 1954 when
(according to reliable sources) he
will get his discharge.

In Time Mag's Election Sidelights
it was noted that Sing Sing prisoners
were allowed the privilege of stav
ing up and listening to the election
returns. Question: Are our wardens
old-fashioned?

The most interesting bits of infor
mation are thrown in 410 via the
transom probably Sebastian Bruno
again!

Raspberries to: Those campus poli
ticians and leaders who believe in a
policy of isolationism for beauty
(noticeable in the minority!)
Thrown in the window: Company
C's touch football team knocks Ar
thur Hall 40-0. After this mighty
feat they were beaten by some
scrubs i:i a short PT session.
