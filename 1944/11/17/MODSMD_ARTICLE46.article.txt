# OUR HASHER SEZ:...
## 
### Joe Sher 
According to reports circulating around the
campus, the Farm will trek toward the Berkeley
stadium for a little tilt between the Cal Bears
and the thundering Trojans of Figueroa Tech
tomorrow.
In cars (a lucky and gassy few), in the sturdy
local, by foot, on horseback and practically
every form of transportation, the Indians are
packing their check books and their sguaws
and making the move.
The game probably won't be worth a damn
as no one seems to care who wins, but the fun
and excitement of a football game has aroused
a flood of enthusiasm as these old grounds have
not seen in years.
The senior barbecue, which is also open to
juniors, the Lagunita Union formal, the Pom
Pom Prom; the big rally in the pavilion, the
bonfire (I could use a little of that wood on these
cold mornings but I understand guards have
been posted; of course that is just hearsay,** al
though really, I just love buckshot), and the
variety of other plans, wet and dry, have made
the Farm echo and re-echo with activity.
Two of the newest additions to the array of
talent to be presented at the senior barbecue
are a trio and a guartet. The trio is called the
"Soup Group," becouse they really know their
beans; the men's group is "the four F's," and
the reason for that name will be obvious.
Little explanation about the rally in the pavil
ion tonight: One of the speakers will be Ser
geant Tom Casey, one of the oldest Indian sup
porters and practically a tradition around the
school. "Casey," as he is affectionately known
to the people who have seen him and know his

feeling toward the school and Stanford teams,
need not be introduced, but for those of you
who have not met Casey this will serve as a
little bit of introduction to a man who for so
long has been a firm fixture and well known
personality at all Stanford rallies.
The lungs of the Stanford students have not
been stretched for the last couple of years, un
less of course it has been to scream for more
food, for help when parked, or for the simple
effort of calling someone to the phone. This
is your chance and when our yell leaders Ric
Supple and Johnny Carr stand up in front of
you on that little platform and call for more and
more volume in that little yell or the big six,
don't just lean back in your seats; cut loose with
a yell that will move your neighbor over into
some one else's lap (ray that is an idea).
The Cal students have always been known
as a bunch of loud mouths but let's for this day
take over that title and show them that we can
howl like the Stanford Indian who was once
five thousand stiong, and now that he is down
to about three thousand is no reason that he has
lost his voice.
Inside information from the Gaieties press
agent informs us that this year the Gaieties
will be bigger and better than ever before and
there is room. Hours and hours of practice un
der the gentle supervision of Peggy Fitts and
Janice Shaughnessy (they do this gently, as
whips have been forbidden).
Practice has not been very strenuous as only
twenty-five people this far have collapsed from
exhaustion. Wihle this little group practices
the campus waits with bated breath for the fin
ished product.
