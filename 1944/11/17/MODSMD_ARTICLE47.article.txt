# Dr. Bailey Willis Reminisces About 'Farm' life Since 1891
## 
### TED DRENTON 
Recalling the incidents of his 33
years at Stanford, Dr. Bailey Willis,
professor emeritus of geology and
member of the Stanford faculty since
1911, declared that the Stanford stu
dent of today is plagued by the same
problem with which his father was
confronted; that of picking a major
field for study.
'"Rare is the Stanford student who
has a definite objective before reach
ing his Junior year â€” providing he
stays with us that long," reflected
Dr. Willis.
tudies Earthquakes
Though Dr. Willis is still vitally
interested in research in all phases
of his field, the study of earthquakes
has always been a special attraction
to him. This interest was passed
down to him by his predecessor, Dr.
J. C. Branner, who was caught in the
1906 quake and felt, as a result, that
the study of earthquakes was an
obligation.
Dr. Willis has carried on research
in the major earthquake regions of
the world, including those of Califor
nia, Japan, India, South America,
Europe and Africa. According to his
observations, the coast ranges west
of Stanford are gradually being
pushed inland and another earth
quake may someday result.
Exercises Daily
Living by the theory that man is
as old as he feels, Dr. Willis defies
the fact that he is 87 years old by
exercising daily with the apparatus
in the gym room. Bristling his thick,
gray beard, he said, "There is no bet
ter tonic than this!"
Dr. Willis' mental faculties have
not been given a period of rest,
either, since he devotes six hours
'daily to typing manuscripts and
sometimes carries ideas in his head
for as long as three days before set
ting them down. "The brain is like
a goblet of wine which you pour
down before the sparkle is lost."
Writes Books
Dr. Willis is now writing several
hooks upon the subject, "Geological
Theories Relating to the Interior of
the Earth," and is contributing to a
supplement of the geological map of
North America, published in 1911 by
the Geological Society of America."
Before coming to Stanford, Dr.
Willis lectured on geology at Johns
Hopkins and the University of Chi
cago. He is a holder of an honorary
Ph.D. from the University of Berlin
and a ScD. from Columbia Univer
sity.
Now living on campus, Dr. Willis
states that he no longer has any
particular ambition other than to

continue research in his field, to en
joy the companionship of his friends,
and to treasure the simple happiness
of life.
