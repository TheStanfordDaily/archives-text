"Is Life Worth Living?", Lennox
Robinson's delightful comedy con
cerning the effect of introspective
drama upon simple Irish folk, is
coming to the Little Theater Decem
ber 6 for a five-night run. This is the
second production of the season by
the Stanford Players, and is directed
i by Norman Philbrick.
The earnest Thespians who cause
all the trouble in this simple village
! are Hector and Constance Cans tan -
! cia, played by George Crane and
j Sally Stocker. Their slightly impe
■ cunious theatrical company concerns
i itself with such dramatists as Ibsen
and Tchekov. A situation is created
when the poor Irish resort folk take
to heart the misery of the world and
throw their Celtic souls with reckless
abandon into the bitterness and fu
j tility of life.
Jinx Man •
Guilty of introducing the misfor
tunes of the universe to the Irish is
genial Mr. Twohig, as performed by
Martin Nelder. Proprietor of the Inn,
I it is his decision which brings new
drama to the town. He is fascinated
|by the productions, but his wife,
j fashionable Anne Twohig, finds them
j rather dismal.
Miss Lizzie Twohig, spinsterish
; sister of John Twohig, has, it seems,
a deep tragedy in her life. However,
jit takes the combined talents of the
Stocker - Crane Thespians and the
great Russian playwright to make
I the poor lady realize that she is
[ truly unhappy.
; Romance, too
Christine, played by Mary Cogs
well, and Eddie, played by Ed Maher,
provide a romantic twist to the story,
amid the calamities which befall the
town following the advent of the
"drama."
Milton Valentine, as Peter Hurley,
is cast as Miss Twohig's tragedy of
the past, and Helena (Pat Neilson)
and Michael (Richard Moorsteen)
develop into troublesome domestics.
Originally called "Drama at Irish,"
the play was first presented in Dub
lin and later in London. Since its
first production 11 years ago, it has
proved to be one of the most suc
cessful plays for Little Theater pro
ductions.
