### NANCY BANNICK 
A review just received from the
London Times of "The Art of Fal
[ corny," published by the Stanford j
I University Press, says"It is a won- j
| derful book, and the production is up ,
| to America's best."
The University Press has been rec- !
j ognized as one of the outstanding 1
presses of the country for its beau
tiful publications of fine books. Its j
latest publication, "Paddle - Wheel
Days in California," an account of
the river boats and ferries, is already
[ in its second printing.
| Produces Outstanding Series
The Press has produced two out - 1
standing series, the Hoover Library j
publications, now numbering 18 vol- j
umes, and the "World Politics Se
| l ies," edited by Professor Graham
! Stuart, with 19 titles. Other series !
iof University publications are the j
"University Series," the Dudley !
Herbarium series, and the "Lane |
Medical Lectures."
"Who's Who in Latin America,"i
compiled by Professor Percy A. Mar- !
tin, was greeted with international !
acclaim at its first printing in 1935. J
A second, revised and enlarged, edi
tion was published in 1840 and a ]
third edition, greatly enlarged, is i
i now in preparation.
J Two Books Win Fame
During the past year two Stanford
publications were selected as being j
! among the "Best 60 Educational j
Eooks of the Year." They were Dr. J
j Strong's monumental study on "Vo- j
! cational Interests of Men and Worn- J
en" and Dr Fenton's "Mental Hy- '
giene in School Practice."
Professor Chan's "Chinese Reader
j for Beginners," now in its sixth !
I printing, was selected as one of the
"Fifty Books of 1242" for excellence
of format. Professor Holden's "Top- J
i Management, Organization and Con
; trol" is also in its sixth printing.
Begins in 1892
The earliest learned publication
officially issued by Stanford Uni- j
| versity appeared in 1892. As there j
j were no printing facilities on the |
campus at that time, the printing j
was done in San Francisco. The sec- j
ond publication appeared in 1895
| with the name of Palo Alto on the
! title page.
Julius Andrew Quelle, class of '95,
j set up a private printing plant on the
j campus as the printing needs grew,

| and by 1908 the University was able
! to launch a publication program c?
j a series of monographs which were
| printed on the campus.
| Stanford Purchases Plant
The University purchased Quelle's
printing plant in 1917, and added
j considerable equipment. In 1920 Will
A. Friend was appointed superin
' tendent, and more improvements
were made. In 1929 a modern build
ing was built to house the shop.
Complete offset equipment, both
plate-making and presses, were in
stalled in 1934, so that today prac
j tically everything in the way of
I printing can bo done right on cam
pus. A limited amount of color work
j has been done in the past and a more
extensive program is being under-
I taken tiiis year with the preparation
j of full-color campus scenes on the
I front cover of the Stanford Alumni
; Review. Approximately 60 employ
i ees are on the payroll.
Publication Department Set Up
The publication department was
1 set up in 1925 with Professor William
! Hawley Davis as editor. A sales staff
i was organized and Will A. Friend
! was made manager of both the man
j ufacturing and publishing depart
j ments, a position which he still holds.
The only fields which the Press
I does not consider are fiction, current
j poetry and juveniles. Many of their
! authors are Stanford men, but ap
| proximately 50 per cent have no con
i nection with the University.
