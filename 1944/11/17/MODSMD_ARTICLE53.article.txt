It is suggested that students clip this box of songs and cheers
for use at the Cal-U.S.C. game tomorrow. Ric Supple will lead
the rooting section in cheering for both U.S.C. and Stanford; he
will teach students the U.S.C. yells at the rally tonight.

HAIL STANFORD HAIL
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range
lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices hail
ing
Thee, our alma mater.
Chorus:
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring, as we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, hail!
Hail, Stanford, hail!
THE CARDINAL IS WAVING
The Cardinal is waving over the
field,
Our men are fighting with a
spirit that will not yield.
RAH! RAH! RAH!
Farewell, old Berkeley—we're
after you;
Once again the Cardinal will
WHIP the Gold and Blue.
