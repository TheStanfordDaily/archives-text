# Museum Exhibits Relics of West
## 
### 
The Old West is extremely well
represented in present exhibitions in
the Stanford Museum of Art. Per
| haps the most impressive relic is the
I large locomotive, the "Governor
Stanford." This engine, with its huge,
funnel-shaped smokestack, was the
first locomotive purchased for the
Central Pacific Railroad. It was
shipped to California by way of Cape
Horn and arrived at Sacramento
I October 7, 1803. Lelund Stanford.
Sr., was at (hat time governor of
I California and president of the Cen
, tral Pacific Railroad. The arrival of
I the early train engine was such a
| great event that it inspired an un
j heard-of feat—ten miles of track laid
I in a single day.
| Get a Horse!
Alongside the locomotive, are an
early American light carriage, an
old "buggy," a Palo Alto fire wagon,
and a collection of fine saddles —
I western, pack, and side-saddles.
The room also contains paintings
of early western — especially early
Calil'ornian — scenes, a collection of
pistols, and a model of an old adobe
hut.
What George Washington Knew
Another early western room ex
hibits colonial beds, bureaus, cradles
and spinning wheels. Of special in
terest are an old Melodian and a
large weaving loom. Small, fashion
able spectacles of the day are dis
played along with an uncomfortable
looking tool designed for the extrac
tion of colonial teeth. This "turnkey"
resembles a good-sized gimlet, with
a heavy hook on the end, and was
operated by a "twist of the wrist."
The bed-warmer, a no more luxuri
ous-appearing article, consists of a
metal container for hot coals—not
; exactly the type one could snuggle
' up to.
Stanford Souvenirs
The Leland Stanford room also of
fers a variety of early scenes and
souvenirs. There is a marvelous dis
play of Mrs. Stanford's gowns and
fans, which contain beautiful plumes
and hand-painted feathers.
In cases dedicated to Leland Stan
ford, Jr., his early studies and hob
bies are represented. There are im
pressive portraits of the Stanford
family, and just inside the door of
the museum is a large statue of Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford with their son.
