### 
A survey of "Job Opportunities
for College Graduates" will be given
Monday at 7:30 p.m. in the Educa
tion Building by Nathan Francis
Newcomer, veterans' representative
of the War Manpower Commission
in San Francisco.
Newcomer, a recent graduate of
the Stanford Law School and promi
nent member of the Palo Alto Amer
ican Legion, plans a discussion of the
major fields open to graduates now
and in the postwar period. This is the
first of a planned series of talks on
vocational guidance to be presented
this year by Men's Vocom.
"We urge all students who want
to discover the professional man's
views on his career to attend the
talks," said Jordan Peckham, Men's
Vocom chairman, "and we hope that
lower division students especially
will take advantage of this oppor
tunity."
