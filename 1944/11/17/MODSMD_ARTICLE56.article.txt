# Toyon Houses Many Nations
## 
### BILL EILERS 
Originally designed as a composite
housing unit for four Stanford fra
ternities. Toyon Hall, this quarter
switched to a freshman dormitory,
reveals an amazingly heterogeneous
group of fellows. If you don't be
lieve it, drop over some evening—
or to the Toyon reception—and meet
the men.
There's Amin Banani from Tehe
ran, Iran; Klaas 80l from Holland,
and, of course, Bill Hunt from Fair
Oaks (just outside of Sacramento).
T( yon points with pride to its "good
neighbors" from down South Amer
ica way. Pre-Med student George
Bevier hails from Colombia, while
Civil Engineering majors Antonio
Ortega and A 1 Valverve come from
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, respec
tively.
Here at Stanford as language in
formants with the Civil Affairs
Training School are three Japanese-
Americans, Sumio Yoshii, Robert
Hyashi, and Henry Honda. Another
illustrious Toyon resident is Ben
Stilwell, son of General Stilwell.
Dean Bunn yesterday disclosed
some of the interesting history of
Toyon. Built in 1923 at a cost of
about half a million dollars, Toyon
today has accommodations for 153
men. Besides, the fellows enjoy use
of the main lounge, a pool room,
ping pong room, and a social room.
Toyon was originally planned as
the center of four campus fraterni
ties. but demands of non-fraternity
men soon necessitated a change to
an upper class dormitory.
Under the presidency of Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur both Toyon and
Branner were built as homes for
upper division men. Direction of all
men's halls was under Dr. Sharp's
office.
This year, for the first time, Toyon
has its own director. Mrs. Betty Lee
Schatz, a Stanford graduate and
piano instructor here on campus for
many year 3, was asked this fall to
act as director and adviser to the
freshmen. Mrs. Schatz, as Toyon
men have already discovered, really
provides that "homey atmosphere,"
as Dean Bunn phrased it.
Toyon's lounge is one of the most
beautiful halls on campus for par
ties and dances. Besides the recep
tion to be held there Sunday, the
men plan a dance there in Decem
ber, as wel las other events during
the year.

an upper class dormitory.
Under the presidency of Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur both Toyon and
Branner were built as homes for
upper division men. Direction of all
men's halls was under Dr. Sharp's
office.
This year, for the first time, Toyon
has its own director. Mrs. Betty Lee
Schatz, a Stanford graduate and
piano instructor here on campus for
many year 3, was asked this fall to
act as director and adviser to the
freshmen. Mrs. Schatz, as Toyon
men have already discovered, really
provides that "homey atmosphere,"
as Dean Bunn phrased it.
Toyon's lounge is one of the most
beautiful halls on campus for par
ties and dances. Besides the recep
tion to be held there Sunday, the
men plan a dance there in Decem
ber, as wel las other events during
the year.
Originally designed as a composite
housing unit for four Stanford fra
ternities. Toyon Hall, this quarter
switched to a freshman dormitory,
reveals an amazingly heterogeneous
group of fellows. If you don't be
lieve it, drop over some evening—
or to the Toyon reception—and meet
the men.
There's Amin Banani from Tehe
ran, Iran; Klaas 80l from Holland,
and, of course, Bill Hunt from Fair
Oaks (just outside of Sacramento).
T( yon points with pride to its "good
neighbors" from down South Amer
ica way. Pre-Med student George
Bevier hails from Colombia, while
Civil Engineering majors Antonio
Ortega and A 1 Valverve come from
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, respec
tively.
Here at Stanford as language in
formants with the Civil Affairs
Training School are three Japanese-
Americans, Sumio Yoshii, Robert
Hyashi, and Henry Honda. Another
illustrious Toyon resident is Ben
Stilwell, son of General Stilwell.
Dean Bunn yesterday disclosed
some of the interesting history of
Toyon. Built in 1923 at a cost of
about half a million dollars, Toyon
today has accommodations for 153
men. Besides, the fellows enjoy use
of the main lounge, a pool room,
ping pong room, and a social room.
Toyon was originally planned as
the center of four campus fraterni
ties. but demands of non-fraternity
men soon necessitated a change to
an upper class dormitory.
