# Pom-Pom Prom Follows Cal-SC Game Tomorrow
## 
### 
Women, today is the last day you
can buy your bid to the POM-POM
PROM.
To avoid the rush, go to the ASSU
office between 1 and 3 this afternoon
and thus save hall chairmen and
yourself that mad Saturday dash
after the game when you arrive
home hot and excitedâ€”all ready for
the last lap of Stanford's first real
Big Game Weekend in many a
month- and find yourself without a
ticket.
Providing you already have your
bid, the dance promises you an eve
ning of rousing songs and music,
colorful decorations and satisfying
refreshments. Art Weidner and his
orchestra will plav a medley of col

lege, fraternity and service songs
during the evening, besides the pop
ular songs of the day.
The gym will be covered with col
lege banners from all over the
United States, centered around the
big Stanford rooting flag. In the
middle of the floor will be one huge
cardinal red pom-pom with red and
white streamers extending to all
parts of the walls.
At the end of the fifth dance, Bar
bara White, ASSU president, and
Barbara Upshaw, ASSU vice-presi
dent, will lead the grand march,
followed by Betty Lou Horton, Union
president; Louise Kaiser, Lagunita
president, and heads of the dance
committees.
