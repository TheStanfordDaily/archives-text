# BULL SESSION
## 
### Dick Crane 
After all the excitement of last weekend, I woke up to stare
a beautiful Sunday morning in the face and said. "Crane, since
the quarter began, you have been writing of nothing but sex,
beer, and ridiculing the various departments and committees of
Stanford. It is high time you wrote something constructive. You
should leave the Daily—thirteen more issues—with a good,
clean taste in your mouth and a feeling that you have actually
contributed to something worthwhile." Here is my serious con
tribution for the quarter.
The political campaign for the presidency is now a thing
of the past and Roosevelt is once again the leader of our country
for another four years.—This is to my deepest chagrin, but of
course I mentioned that the campaign was a thing of the past. . . .
The president, however, seems to be starting his new term in
the way that a lot of people had a definite fear about. If you
observed last week's Chronicle, you probably noticed in one of
the editorial pages a huge caustic column, devoting its com
ment on a new proposed plan of the president's, in which he
will force all the youth of the country into government-controlled
camps for a year or more. The proposed plan will take all
American boys at the age of 17 years, and under compulsory
training, will mold their minds and thoughts to any way the
government would like to have them think.
This plan smacks so strongly of Fascism that it is fantastic and
unbelievable. The unmitigated gall and utter conceit of this man
has undoubtedly never been surpassed in the history of our
country. How he could think that the citizens of this country
would be gullible enough to swallow such "hooey" is more than
one could imagine. If this plan goes through for our young
boys, what is to prevent him from forcing the young girls into
his regimentation also?
I am an ex-serviceman and feel very strongly about'this. I
fought for this country, to keep Fascism, communism, and all
forms of compulsion out of this country for all time. This man,
however, dares to instigate his dictatorship principles, while our
men are still fighting and dying for the ideals I mentioned.
If the plan called for military training, I would be all for it,
but it does not. Outside of training our youth to meet further
emergencies, I sincerely believe that all forms of governmental
compulsory training for the American youth should be stamped
out right now, before its malignant growth gets a good foothold.
"Stubbies of the Week"
To Glenn "Pop" Warner and Sgt. Casey for their wonderful
talks at the rally Friday night. They were very inspirational in
their talks. It's too bad we didn't have a football team to back
them up.
