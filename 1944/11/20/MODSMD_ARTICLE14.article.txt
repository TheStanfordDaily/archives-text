To the Editor:
As president of Conference, I feel I have no personal opin
ions for publication. And the opinion of Conference, ideally,
is representative of that of the women students as a whole.
At our last meeting we discussed the matter of Stanford
-vomen's competing in "Queen Contests." During the discus
sion we saw more harm than good in changing a long-standing
conference policy for this one dance.
If, as you said in your editorial, "this action met with disap
oroval from Stanford women when the house presidents re
urned to tell their constituency of the measures they had taken
o protect them ..." We will hear about it from the presidents
jf those houses at Monday's meeting.
Sincerely, Sally Breuner, for Women's Conference.
