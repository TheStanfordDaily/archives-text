## Hollywood Fails Checkov By Miscasting 'Storm' 
### 
SUMMER STORM—now playing at
the Varsity Theater.
Anton Chekov's "Summer Storm"
is another of Hollywood's psycho
logical studies, this time of a man's
struggle with his conscience. George
Sanders portrays the petty Russian
judge who sends a peasant to Siberia
for a crime he committed.
Sanders is one of those wine,
women and song boys who, together
with most of his township, is out
after Linda Darnell, "the most beau
tiful woman God ever forgot to put
a soul into." When George learns
that Linda doesn't appreciate his
affections, he gently knifes her in a
vital spot and pins the murder on a
nearby peasant. Sanders' futile ef
fort to escape from his conscience
ends with George sprawled out on a
barroom floor, a bullet through his
heart. a
"Summer Storm" has a strong,
solid plot that receives miserable
treatment by an incompetent cast.
Sanders looks out of place in his
Russian costumes and performs in an

unconvincing manner, while Miss
Darnell interprets her role half
heartedly. Edward Everett Horton,
as a Russian prince, acts his usual
inane self, not knowing what else
to do.
The second feature is a Preston
Sturges film, "The Great: Moment."
which tells the story of the inven
tion of ether. Joel McCrea and Betty
Field attempt to wade through this
hopeless mess but have little luck.
The Sturges touch is evidenced in
brief glimpses ol- humor that are
eclipsed for the most part by the
uninteresting story. This feature is
just the opposite of "'Summer Storm"
in that here a capable cast struggles
through the poor story. This will
probably be Preston Sturges' only
adventure into the serious side of
life.—Dick Bower.
