# WAR FRONTS

### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The western front is again in ac
tion, every sector now moving into
Germany, with the exception of the
northernmost one. The radical pic
ture has been altered and the new
change might make this offensive the
decesive one.
The previous policy had been for
limited attacks on limited sectors.
Wherever an opening was to be
found, an Allied army would jab
into it.
New Policy
Now the tactics employed seem to
call for a general attack all along the
line when one enemy sector is weak.
This is for the better, since, formerly,
the Germans could shift their weight
from a more stabilized area to a
threatened one, and, by virtue of the
power of fortified lines, make our
task much more difficult. Now they
cannot do this, as they are under
pressure every place. The weaken
ing of any German part of the front
might produce an Allied break
through.
Previous Allied offensives felt out
the German lines. The advances in
Holland and around Metz showed
the enemy weak here, while the
bloody thrust around Aachen dem
onstrated that he was in force in
that area.
Now a new army, the Ninth, has
been plugged into the Aachen gap.
and the British forces, formerly
holding the area that the Ninth now
watches, can move north for the
thrust there.
Holland Decisive
The main thrust will probably
come in Holland for two reasons.
One ,the Germans around here are
shaken up more than in any other
sector, and, two, the enemy has only
one good defense line, the Maas, in
this sector, while he has two —the
Rhine and the remnants of the Sieg
fried line —farther south. The ter
rain is also most adaptable to mech
anized warfare. The battle, if it de
velops this way, will be a gigantic
model of those of Frederick the
Great — the whole line advancing
while one wing shoots out and curves
around the enemy.
