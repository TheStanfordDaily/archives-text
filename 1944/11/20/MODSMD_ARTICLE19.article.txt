with yet another win of 2-0, this time
from Casa Ventura. Casa Adelpha
defeated Union 2-1 after a hard- ;
fought struggle.
Branner 2E Wins
In the 8 o'clock section, Branner
2E easily downed Branner S by a
â€¢ore of 2-0, and Roble IB came j

through again to defeat 'Magnolia
2-0. Branner 1W won their game
from Roble 1A by default; postponed
until November 29 was the game be
tween Storey House and Roble 3A.
As the scores now stand, Adelpha
and Roble 3 center are tied for the
lead in Division 1, each with two
wins and one loss, and each with one
more game to play. In the second
division the Roble Sponsors arc lead
ing with an undefeated record, but
with one more game to go; second to
the Roble Sponsors is Hurlburt

contest with both Roble IC and Roble
IB undefeated; their final game with
each other will decide the winner of
that division. Branner 2E leads Divi
sion IV with a record of three wins
and one loss. However, there are too
many games still to be played in this
division to give an accurate rating.
Storey House is undefeated, having
won two games, one by default.
