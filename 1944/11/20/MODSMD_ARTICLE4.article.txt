Editor's Note: This is the 4th in a series of interviews on the postwar world.
"At the end of this war, America will have a 'second chance' to partici
pate in international efforts to keep the peace," declared Dr. Thomas S.
Barclay, professor of political science.
''The results of the recent campaign and election showed a clear trend
away from isolation in the platforms of the major parties, in the speeches

of the two candidates, and in the de
feat of several prominent isolation
ists. This offers hope that we will not
repeat our disastrous 1919-20 ex
periences with peace-making.
"But there are pitfalls on the road
to enduring peace which it would be
unwise to ignore," Dr. Barclay
warned. Many of these dangers are
intimately connected .with certain
factors of American government and
politics.
First Danger
"First must be considered the
much - criticised constitutional re
quirement that treaties be ratified
by a two-thirds majority of the sen
ate. Nearly every President has been
confronted by the "recalcitrant one
third plus one" in that body when an
important treaty was being consid
ered. The treaty of peace with Spain
in 1898 was almost defeated, being
ratified by just one more than the
necessary two-thirds. The Treaty of
Versailles failed by seven votes to
secure the required two-thirds.
"Proposed constitutional amend
ments providing for ratification of
treaties by a majority of both houses
of Congress are now*receiving much
support, but I think it highly doubt
ful that such a change will be adopt
ed in the near future. Regardless of
party affiliation, the senate adheres
rigidly to its powers as an executive
council.
Personal Feeling
"On occasion," he continued, "the
senate has let personal antagonism
and party differences with the presi
dent influence its attitude toward
treaties. Economic, sectional, racial
anr even religious factors have been
involved, and may reappear to cause
trouble at the close of the present
war.
"There also exists in the senate a
determination to establish and main
tain its 'rights' against the executive.
It has what Theodore Roosevelt
called an "immense capacity for re
sistance.'' Debate in the senate is
practically unlimited, and any sena
tor may discuss almost any subject
at any time.
"Lines will soon begin to form in I
the senate for the momentous debate j
over American participation in the j
proposed world organization to !
maintain peace. Fortunately, the i
leaders and platforms of both parties !
have avoided making this great issue {
a partisan one. Important senators
and representatives of both parties j
are in close touch with Secretary
Hull in his notable endeavor to se- j
cure bi-partisan support for world |
security plans. Senate leaders of i
both parties have* indicated a com
mendable spirit of cooperation.

away from isolation in the platforms of the major parties, in the speeches

First Danger
"First must be considered the
much - criticised constitutional re
quirement that treaties be ratified
by a two-thirds majority of the sen
ate. Nearly every President has been
confronted by the "recalcitrant one
third plus one" in that body when an
important treaty was being consid
ered. The treaty of peace with Spain
in 1898 was almost defeated, being
ratified by just one more than the
necessary two-thirds. The Treaty of
Versailles failed by seven votes to
secure the required two-thirds.
"Proposed constitutional amend
ments providing for ratification of
treaties by a majority of both houses
of Congress are now*receiving much
support, but I think it highly doubt
ful that such a change will be adopt
ed in the near future. Regardless of
party affiliation, the senate adheres
