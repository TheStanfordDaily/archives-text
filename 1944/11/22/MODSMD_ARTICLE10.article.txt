PARIS, Oct. 21 (UP). â€” General
Dwight D. Eisenhower, calling on
soldiers and civilians for a knock
out blow against Germany, implied
today that he expected to trap and
destroy the bulk of the German
forces in Western Europe on this
side of the Rhine in the final great
battle of the European war.
Eisenhower said there was no sign
of a German retreat to the Rhine
and offered as his opinion that an
adversary who had concentrated so
much of his forces west of the river,
when his enemy had air superiority
that could destroy all bridges, would
find that the only sensible course
was to fight to the bitter end west
of the river.
