Students who have followed the Daily's post
war series even in a glancing way, must be im
pressed with the area of agreement and unam
ity among our leading professors in discussions
of future world organization for peace.
Not only have the Dumbarton Oaks proposals
been endorsed but the feeling is that they will
make a stronger force for peace in the world
than the defunct League because of more mind
ing committments and closer action on varied
questions by the great powers.
On the question of what this teamwork will
mean in aspects of power politics the scene is
one of great certainty—there can be no period
of stalemated dissension as sides hurry to arm
secretly, hoping for others to intercept their
enemies—if the Great Powers are in agreement
no secondary power will dare oppose them.
And it they are in disagreement, nothing can
keep the peace.
These facts reveal that the structure to main
'ain peace will be explosive and obviously not
to be handled in a perfunctory manner, as any
nation's secondary enterprise.
Functional councils were named as the essen
tial instruments to obtain the support of the
people for the work of international cooperation.
Yesterday's papers contained an encouraging
and perfect example of the importance and effi
ciency of such a council, in the work accom
plished to plan the use and development of
airways throughout the world.
All the professors interviewed insisted that
the power to call troops immediately was abso
lutely essential to the effectiveness of the se
curity council. This question seems to be the
one hope of the bloc of reactionary forces in
our country to keep us from our second great
chance to act for world peace.
The question involves the absolute sover
eignty of our nation and the absolute control
of the senate over our ability to go to war.
In the question of the sovereignty of our na
tion we will fight the battle of "states rights"
over again, slowly and painfully we will have
to prove our professed sincerity to have peace
in the world at the cost, for instance, of allow
ing the "enigmatic roosians" to speak their
piece at the conference tables.
In the senate fight forces for international
cooperation have the recent election "wrist slap
ping" of isolationists powerfully on their side.
If the voters and future voters make that triumph
emphatic the senate will detect the sentiment
amazingly fast.
The key point about getting action to enforce
peace seems to be that the President retains
>he power (to employ the armed forces wher
ever there are United States cifizens, territory,
~>r offenses against the law of nations for viola
'ions of treaties).
This means power to act quickly can be ren
fered if we have the will to act. There is no
greater hindrance to legislative discussion, how
ever, than public apathy.
There are forces for both sides on all of these
questions in our country today. Now is the time
o determine the situation and keep the posi
tive forces alive and effective. It's an old rule
of folklore that there are no third chances.—

questions in our country today. Now is the time
o determine the situation and keep the posi

Students who have followed the Daily's post
war series even in a glancing way, must be im
pressed with the area of agreement and unam
ity among our leading professors in discussions
of future world organization for peace.
Not only have the Dumbarton Oaks proposals
been endorsed but the feeling is that they will
make a stronger force for peace in the world
than the defunct League because of more mind
ing committments and closer action on varied
questions by the great powers.
On the question of what this teamwork will
mean in aspects of power politics the scene is
one of great certainty—there can be no period
of stalemated dissension as sides hurry to arm
secretly, hoping for others to intercept their
enemies—if the Great Powers are in agreement
no secondary power will dare oppose them.
And it they are in disagreement, nothing can
keep the peace.
These facts reveal that the structure to main
'ain peace will be explosive and obviously not
to be handled in a perfunctory manner, as any
nation's secondary enterprise.
Functional councils were named as the essen
tial instruments to obtain the support of the
people for the work of international cooperation.
Yesterday's papers contained an encouraging
and perfect example of the importance and effi
ciency of such a council, in the work accom
plished to plan the use and development of
airways throughout the world.
All the professors interviewed insisted that
the power to call troops immediately was abso
lutely essential to the effectiveness of the se
curity council. This question seems to be the
one hope of the bloc of reactionary forces in
our country to keep us from our second great
chance to act for world peace.
The question involves the absolute sover
eignty of our nation and the absolute control
of the senate over our ability to go to war.
In the question of the sovereignty of our na
tion we will fight the battle of "states rights"
over again, slowly and painfully we will have
to prove our professed sincerity to have peace
in the world at the cost, for instance, of allow
ing the "enigmatic roosians" to speak their
piece at the conference tables.
In the senate fight forces for international
cooperation have the recent election "wrist slap
ping" of isolationists powerfully on their side.
If the voters and future voters make that triumph
emphatic the senate will detect the sentiment
amazingly fast.
The key point about getting action to enforce
peace seems to be that the President retains
>he power (to employ the armed forces wher
ever there are United States cifizens, territory,
~>r offenses against the law of nations for viola
'ions of treaties).
This means power to act quickly can be ren
fered if we have the will to act. There is no
greater hindrance to legislative discussion, how
ever, than public apathy.
There are forces for both sides on all of these
questions in our country today. Now is the time
o determine the situation and keep the posi
tive forces alive and effective. It's an old rule
of folklore that there are no third chances.—
