# Bull Session

### Dick Crane 
Tomorrow starts the first vacation of this
quarter, and you can hear students screaming
all over the place, "lust think, four whole days,"
and then immediately go into hysterics. They
really should be only half as hysterical as they
really are, because on analyzing the situation,
you will find that you have only two days va
cation.
The weekends are usually reserved for ne
farious purposes all through the quarter, so that
leaves only Thursday and Friday, as a pleasant
relief from studies. Not that I am trying to dam
pen your holiday spirit, and above all, not be
cause I have to stay on the campus and hash.
Most of the students will be returning to the
family bosom for Thanksgiving. The varied re
actions among the various classes of students in
their welcome home, I will try to typify in the
following paragraphs.—By classes of students, I
mean seniors, juniors, etc.
The senior, goes up to the front door, and
walks in, whereupon his dear old dad greets
him effusively and says, "Come in son, we were
just giving a Thanksgiving prayer in gratitude.
Now that you are a senior, and have only two
quarters to go, we will soon be able to quit
starvation rations, and start eating three times
a day."
The junior walks in the door, and his parents
say, "It's certainly great to have you home,
when do you have to go back? Incidentally,
how is school going along? What have you ac
complished in your two years of school?" The
son says proudly, "I am now in Upper Division,
and can go minus just as much as I want to
without flunking out of school." What the father
says then, you can easily imagine.
The sophomore walks into the house, asks
his father for a cigarette, a scotch and soda, and
the car for the whole vacation. After all, now
that he is through his freshman year, he is very
blase, and terribly, terribly, mundane. His dad
groans horribly, and tries not to imagine what
his son will be like with two more years of col
lege yet to go.
The freshman, ah yes! the dear little first
quarter freshman, who has been torn asunder
from his mother's loving arms. This is a pathetic
sight. His parents do not greet him at the door
of the house, but right at the train. Oh yes!
there is the high school girl friend. "Gee Whiz!"
it's been so long since I have seen all of you.
No, I'm really not crying, it's a cinder in my eye.
Yes, I'm fine. Yes, I get plenty of food. No, I
haven't been down to any of those places down
the highway. Sure, I study, but the instructors
up there don't know that dad is the big shot of
our town, like the high school teachers here."
All these things go to make a happy, happy,
holiday, and don't forget to have a good time.
After all, finals are still three weeks away.

our town, like the high school teachers here."
All these things go to make a happy, happy,
holiday, and don't forget to have a good time.
After all, finals are still three weeks away.
Tomorrow starts the first vacation of this
quarter, and you can hear students screaming
all over the place, "lust think, four whole days,"
and then immediately go into hysterics. They
really should be only half as hysterical as they
really are, because on analyzing the situation,
you will find that you have only two days va
cation.
The weekends are usually reserved for ne
farious purposes all through the quarter, so that
leaves only Thursday and Friday, as a pleasant
relief from studies. Not that I am trying to dam
pen your holiday spirit, and above all, not be
cause I have to stay on the campus and hash.
Most of the students will be returning to the
family bosom for Thanksgiving. The varied re
actions among the various classes of students in
their welcome home, I will try to typify in the
following paragraphs.—By classes of students, I
mean seniors, juniors, etc.
The senior, goes up to the front door, and
walks in, whereupon his dear old dad greets
him effusively and says, "Come in son, we were
just giving a Thanksgiving prayer in gratitude.
Now that you are a senior, and have only two
quarters to go, we will soon be able to quit
starvation rations, and start eating three times
a day."
The junior walks in the door, and his parents
say, "It's certainly great to have you home,
when do you have to go back? Incidentally,
how is school going along? What have you ac
complished in your two years of school?" The
son says proudly, "I am now in Upper Division,
and can go minus just as much as I want to
without flunking out of school." What the father
says then, you can easily imagine.
The sophomore walks into the house, asks
his father for a cigarette, a scotch and soda, and
the car for the whole vacation. After all, now
that he is through his freshman year, he is very
blase, and terribly, terribly, mundane. His dad
groans horribly, and tries not to imagine what
his son will be like with two more years of col
lege yet to go.
The freshman, ah yes! the dear little first
quarter freshman, who has been torn asunder
from his mother's loving arms. This is a pathetic
sight. His parents do not greet him at the door
of the house, but right at the train. Oh yes!
there is the high school girl friend. "Gee Whiz!"
it's been so long since I have seen all of you.
No, I'm really not crying, it's a cinder in my eye.
Yes, I'm fine. Yes, I get plenty of food. No, I
haven't been down to any of those places down
the highway. Sure, I study, but the instructors
up there don't know that dad is the big shot of
our town, like the high school teachers here."
All these things go to make a happy, happy,
holiday, and don't forget to have a good time.
