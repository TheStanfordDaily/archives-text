# Cabbages and Things
## 
### Ed Maher Ed Maher 
With only a few hours left before the Wel
come Thanksgiving vacation begins, after which
we will resume our academic pursuits afresh,
there remain several points which ought to be
cleared up, even though none of them deserve
a whole column of discussion. No morals or!
conclusions are expected to be drawn from
these paragraphs; they only serve to lighten the
chest of the Cabbages.
Considering the geologically perfect color !
and construction theme of the buildings on the 1
Quad —that is, the brown stone and rust tile
motif why is the harmony destroyed by the
insistence on solid black window sills and doors
on these buildings? I know little of art or of !
color as an artistic factor, but I have heard |
people more educated in these matters protest,
and it seems to be well taken enough to deserve
open question.
And, to follw that train of thought, is it not
painful to hear visitors comment on the Chapel
murals, asking rhetorically, "Aren't they simply
beautiful?" Cabbages dissents, saying that
they are are neither simple nor beautiful, being
still more out of harmony with the pleasing tran
quility in color and form with the rest of the
University's architecture.
Curses on the natural phenomena which
cause these two detractions from pleasant life
at Stanford: (1) Whatever it is that directs the
pebbles on the walk between the history and
engineering corners to slip into our shoes as we
are hurrying, already laie, to class; and (2) what
ever it is that makes the pipes in the library ex
pand and contract, giving the effect of a crowd

of gleeful plumbers having a holiday in the
basement.
Cabbages and Things is not in such a nasty
mood as it would seem by the tone of the above
paragraphs. As a matter of fact, we have a cou
pie of overdue complimentary citations to men
tion. One is to the splendid manner of the per
sonnel of the Cooperative Book Store, who, with,
smiles and sugegstions, give a little more than
competent service to patrons, which is a rarity
to be appreciated these days.
As much as one hesitates to toss bouguets o)
roses to one who has a closet full of baskets with
which to collect them, it would be thoughtless
to ignore the deserved comments of praise foi
Johnny High's emceeing at the Pom-Pom Pron.
