# LET'S ALL LAUGH AT THE HONOR CODE
## 
### 
Following is an approximate version of an announcement read
aloud at Lagunita dining hall during dinner Monday night:
"Attendance at Dr. Magaret's lecture on returning service men
this evening is compulsory for all Ventura girls. Those failing to
attend without excuse obtained from their sponsor will be given
technical lockouts. Those who attended the same lecture given
previously for the 'Y' may be excused."
Stop and consider this for a minute. Does it mean that those
girls unable to obtain excuses because they had mditerms to
study for or papers to write not only must take technical lockouts
but also if they failed to report their own absence would be con
sidered as violating the Honor Code?
If this is indeed the case, and it looks as though it would be
hard to construe it in any other way, then we are indeed arriv
ing at a new low in application of the Honor Code at Stanford.
To throw the Honor Code, or the fundamental standard or any
thing else you wish to call it, around in this way is to ultimately
destroy its value altogether.
Why should any Stanford woman, freshman or otherwise, be
required to attend a lecture not directly relating to her life here
at Stanford in the middle of midterms?
This is an example of a deplorable tendency at Stanford to
force women, especially freshmen who do not yet know enough
to stand up and holler for their rights, into the things it is felt they
should do by what is often at once a false and destructive refer
ence to the Honor Code. This tendency can lead to only one
thing, the making of our very real and precious Honor Code a
laughing stock.â€”Nancy Tilden
