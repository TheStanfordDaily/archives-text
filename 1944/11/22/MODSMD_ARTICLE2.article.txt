Frank A. Clarvoe, editor of the
San Francisco News, spoke on "Race
Relations in California after the
War" to the Tuesday Evening Series
audience in Memorial Auditorium
last night.
Mr. Clarvoe began by reviewing
the record of race relations in Cali
fornia in the past, which, he said,
"makes bad reading." Members of
minority races have been imported
to fill some specific need and then
left to shift for themselves after
they have served that particular
purpose.
"World War II has intensified ra
cial tension in California, especially
with Negroes and Japanese. The
war has brought Negroes west in
great numbers. Thex*e is already or
ganized agitation against the re
turn of the Japanese.
Opposition to racial minorities is
based on three well-defined fears,
Mr. Clarvoe said. These include
fear of social equality and inter
marriage, fear of e/icroachment on
white residential districts by other
races, and economic jealousy.
