# AST Echoes
## 
### 
The Echoes are being re-echoed
this week through the good graces
of the ERC's, who, though they had
murder in their hearts after last
week's column, neglected to let their
sadistic tendencies get the best of
them and have continued on with
their kleptomania for the weaker
sex.
And while we are on the subject
of who allows this ... to be written,
I wish to state, as I have stated be
fore, and will state again and again
and again, the policy of this column
as not to offend and offend and of
fend. Use your best Harvard or
Rooseveltian accent on this one.

The Pom-Pom Prom—um da da,
what a night, what a glorious night!
(and morning). Although the mathe
matical probability of getting to
dance on that crowded floor was ap
proximately one million to one, ev
eryone had a good time trying. The
orchestra was small (provided more
room for dancing), but good, with a
variety of fast and slow pieces. As
-ate at Tuesday four AST men were
still having alcoholic hallucinations
from after - the - dance parties and
still enjoying them.

Bennett Weissglass and Leon
Marder tell this story about last Fri
day night at the Army dance. It
seems that Pvt. Egan (I AM in step!)
was introducing his girl, who is from
Boise, Idaho, to the boys. "You're
from Joisey!" they chorused. "We're
from Joisey, too!" The pre-medical
autopsy stated that she died an un
natural death.

Last Friday night was the last
Army dance of this quarter. There is
some lovely, fitting epitaph for the
boys that I will undoubtedly think
of tomorrow.

Overheard:
"His morale is so low unhappiness
would be an improvement."
"If you can't get a date with a good
house Tri-Delt."
"Many an idea has slipped through a
cracked skull."
"Women's Council! Women's Coun
cil!" (Louder and louder.)
"The Irish ARE a productive race."

Stephenville, Texas (since the war,

confirmed the belief that it is actu

new Company Commander. Gual
