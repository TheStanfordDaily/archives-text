### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
"Get the hell outta here!"
"We need copy, copy, copy, aahh!!"
These and other cries, epithets and
wild, insane shrieks •greeted your
saintly Daily reported as she wan
dered into that den of vice and ini
quity, the Chaparral office, yester
day in search of a little information
concerning the history of that Stan
ford brain child, Hammer and Coffin.
(For the purpose of frosh who have
not read their bible from cover to
cover, Hammer and Coffin is the na
tional honorary humor society,
founded at Stanford, which sponsors
the publication of the great publica
tion ,the Stanford Chaparral.)
O. B. Bradley
The Chappie was founded by Bris
tow Adams on October 5, 1899, its
first Old Boy being Chris Bradley,
'00.
Seven short years later a group
from the Chappie staff were relaxing
at Meyer's Pub in Menlo with a small
bit of liquid refreshment to raise
their spirits (pun), when, like a bolt
of lightning, The Idea came forth
from the brain of Morris Oppenheim,
and Hammer & Coffin was founded.
The date was April 16, 1906, and
the next morning saw all of the Bay
area leveled by the San Francisco
earthquake and fire of 1906. Unfor
tunately, many foolish geologists at
tribute this amazing phenomenon to
natural causes—but WE know better.
Pink Lemonade
Reclining resplendent in the Chap
pie office are the famed hammer and
coffin themselves, together with a
pink lemonade chalice contributed
to the Chaparral by Major Walter
Herbert, '00. The chalice will hold
one quart of pink lemonade.
The solid silver hammer weighs 16

pounds and the handle is circled with
silver rings bearing the names of
every member of Hammer and Coffin
since the founding of that honored
society.
Right after the last war Hammer
and Coffin was adopted as the na
tional honorary humor society, and
other chapters sprang up on college
campuses throughout the country.
However, for the duration of the
present war, every chapter of Ham
mer and Coffin has been suspended,
with the exception of Stanford and
the University of California.
Famed Old Boys
Besides distinguishing itself in the
field of ornithology, Hammer and
Coffin, in league with the Chaparral,
has contributed many famed and
distinguished citizens to the world
of arts and letters.
Among these are former Old Boys:
Bruce Bliven, new editor of "The
New Republic"; Feg Murray, creator
of "Seeing Stars"; Northcutt Ely,
well known Washington, D. C., law
yer, and listed in Who's Who; Lance
Warren, foreign correspondent for
the "New York Times" and Milt
Hagen, song writer, composing under
the name of Sterling Sherwin.
Other outstanding Hammer and
Collin alums include Will Irwin, na
tionally known humorist; the late
Norman H. Davis, former head of the
American Red Cross, and Harry Bor
ba, sports writer for the "San Fran
cisco Examiner." Bristow Adams,
himself, founded seven other major
magazines after his graduation from
Stanford.
Present Staff
A. Garney Bugle, known to his

friends as "Barney," is the present
Old Boy; his office will be assumed
by Dick Driscoll, former ASSU
president, next quarter. Business
manager for the Chappie is Bill Gil
bert, who is ably assisted in his ef
forts to supply ads (so they won't
have to need so much copy) by a
bevy of feminine pulchritude; these
gorgeous women sally forth to the
big, bad city of San Francisco, brav
ing the advertising managers of the
great department stores in their very
dens—and all for the sake of the
Chappie.
As proof of their valiant efforts
we have the Chappie's amazing rec
ord to turn to: 396 issues in the last
45 years.
Etaoin, Shrdlu
At this point your reporter feels
the hot breath of anger down her
neck; she looks up to face the entire
Chappie staff glowering at her in
rank hatred. Beyond the faces of the
staff she sees the walls of the Chap
pie office, covered with glood, gore
and sex (oh, horrible thought!) She
watches in fascinated terror as the
Old Boy advances, and — etaoin,
shrdlu, etaoin, shrdul blblblbaaaaaa
(guess we got her out of that one.)
With a sudden burst of energy,
she breaks out of the Chappie office,
running and screaming in frenzy of
insane fear, "Send your next Chappie
to a Stanford man overseas!"
