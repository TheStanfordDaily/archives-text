# Hot Jazz Society Elects Officers
## 
### 
Stanford's newly formed Hot Jazz
Society held its first meeting Monday
night for the purpose of electing offi
cers, setting membership dues and
deciding the time and place of future
meetings.
Joann Schiff, former president of
the San Jose Hot Jazz Society, was
elected president; Juanita Smith,
vice-president and Charlotte Tilton,
secretary - treasurer. Membership
dues were set at $1 per quarter. This
money will be used to bring guest
speakers and musicians from the Bay
area to the meetings. The group will
meet on the first and third Mondays
of every month at 8 p.m., in the
Music Listening Room.
Future meetings will feature "real
and righteous" music in the New
Orleans manner, and there will be
some Chicago style records played.
Any Stanford musician or would
be musician interested in forming a
true jazz band will be welcomed at
the next meeting, said Miss Shiff.
All those interested in jazz are
invited to attend the next meeting
on December 3.
