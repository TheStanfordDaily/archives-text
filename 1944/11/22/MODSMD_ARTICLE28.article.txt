## Lamour Stranded On Usual Island 
### 
Somewhere west of Wilshire Boul
evard, Paramount has built "Rain
bow Isle" for Dorothy Lamour and
her sarong. The finished product is
now on display at the Stanford The
atre for those interested.

This time Miss
Lamour is sur
rounded by three
marooned seamen,
Eddie, Bracken
Gil Lamb and
Barry Sullivan.
.The usual trite
'plot finds the
quartet trying to
rule "Rainbow
Isle" via the song
and dance method.

Lamour's sarong comes in for a lot
of kidding and at times the film is a
burlesque of Dottie's previous South
Sea ventures.
Here is escapist entertainment for
those of you who are tired of flunk
ing mid-quarters.
Salinas Susie
The second feature, "Kansas City
Kitty,'' is a weak little vehicle that
presents some more of Joan Davis
and her rustic humor. Bob Crosby
and Jane Frazee are also on hand to
sing some of the popular tunes of the
day. Kansas City is this reviewer's
home town but it's certainly not as
bad as this feature. I suggest the
title "Salinas Susie."
Bills, Bills. Rills
The Varsity also is showing a
South Seas picture, "Trade Winds,"
in which Frederic March and Joan
Bennett have top billing. The sec
ond "hit" on the Varsity bill is "In
Old California," with John Wayne
and Binnie Barnes.
Going down the highway a tavern
or two, we find that the Mayfield is
exhibiting "Bowery to Broadway,"
another of those epics of New York
at the turn of the century. Jack
Oakie (who has certainly acquired
a large mid-section) and some more
old-timers are in the cast. Also on
the bill is "Girl in the Case," a foul
little mystery film.
The Menlo is reviving Danny
Kaye's "Up In Arms," which some
people evidently enjoyed.
This is a rather disgusting line-up
of entertainment and you would
probably be better off by taking the
circle tour to Mangini's, Dinah's, and
Belt's that will be in progress all
weekend.
