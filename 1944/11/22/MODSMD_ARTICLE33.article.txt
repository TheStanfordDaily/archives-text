# Graham Novel Good Reading
## 
### 
EARTH AND HIGH HEAVEN, by
Gwethalyn Graham, is an unusually
successful first novel; it has a serious
theme combined with an eminently
direct and readable style. It. is, es
sentially, the story of a love affair
between a Gentile and a Jew. It is
also the picture of generation oppos
ing generation, and it would be an
understatement to say that it has
contemporary significance.
The setting is Canada; the time it;
1942; the heroine is Erica, who is
from one of Montreal's first families
and her lover, Marc, is a young Jew
ish lawyer. The story begins with a
witty and accurate description of i
cocktail party and the wit continues
through the agonizing conflicts of
Erica with her family.
Her parents are particularly well -
drawn; their cruelty to her is cred
ible because their love for her is als<
credible. The slow creation of Erica's
relationship with Marc is balanced
by the slow destruction of the easy
and affectionate understanding be
tween her and her father, Charles
Drake.
Although all the characters arc
real, Charles—the tragically impel
ceptive father—is the best. He is fa)
removed from the traditional stem
father of fiction by his capacity tc
be hurt as well as to hurt his daugh
ter.
Even though the ending of the
book is consistent, it happens toe
fast; the reader is satisfied but a
little hurried. A book that deals with
as many fundamental and universal
human conflicts as this one cannot',
finish as smoothly as an ordinary
best-seller. Miss Graham has a lo
to say; and Americans, with Cana -
dians, should be impatient for hev
next book.—Knox.
