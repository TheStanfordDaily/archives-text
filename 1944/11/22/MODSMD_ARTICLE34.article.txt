## 
### TED DRENTON 
Professor Marion R. Kirkwood, Dean of the Law School, is continuing
to specialize in phases of property and equity law as he has done for the
last 32 years. He began his instruction here in 1912 after receiving his A.B.
and L.B. degrees from the Stanford Law School.
He has written several books, including "Introduction to the Study of

Law," and "Conveyances, Two Edi
tions" and has been a member of
the editorial board of the Foundation
Press, which publishes law school
texts.
The Law School is following recent
law trends and is giving several
courses in administrative and labor
Jaw, states Professor Kirkwood. Ad
ministrative law has become particu
arly important with the increase of
government agencies in wartime, and
•;ith the anticipated importance of
government agencies in peacetime.
At present 53 students are enrolled
„n the department, a drop of 70 per
rent from normal times, which is at
tributed to the lack of draft defer
.-.lent status for the law student. Six
professors and one associate profes
sor are instructing in the depart
ment.
The curriculum is revised every
year to keep abreast of modern law
irends; however, the basic require
ments are never changed.
Required courses cover the whole
field of law, with which every stu
dent must have at least some ac
quaintance; however, electives are
offered to give students an opportu
nity to study in a special field of law.
Electives offered include public law,
commercial law and taxation laws.
During the first year two-thirds of
the courses are required, though only
half the courses are required during
the last two years.
Three years of college work must
precede admittance to the Law
School and a year in Law School
mlist be completed before the A.B.
Pre-Legal is granted. Upon comple
tion of the last two years in law
school an L.B. is granted; and if stu
dents wish to study another year
tihey may receive an MA. degree.
! Although California has the most
Severe bar examinations in the
country. Stanford students have done
exceptionally well. Last year all but
one student passed the examination.

Professor Marion R. Kirkwood, Dean of the Law School, is continuing
to specialize in phases of property and equity law as he has done for the
last 32 years. He began his instruction here in 1912 after receiving his A.B.
and L.B. degrees from the Stanford Law School.
He has written several books, including "Introduction to the Study of

Law," and "Conveyances, Two Edi
tions" and has been a member of
the editorial board of the Foundation
Press, which publishes law school
texts.
The Law School is following recent
law trends and is giving several
courses in administrative and labor
Jaw, states Professor Kirkwood. Ad
ministrative law has become particu
arly important with the increase of
government agencies in wartime, and
•;ith the anticipated importance of
government agencies in peacetime.
At present 53 students are enrolled
„n the department, a drop of 70 per
rent from normal times, which is at
tributed to the lack of draft defer
.-.lent status for the law student. Six
professors and one associate profes
sor are instructing in the depart
ment.
The curriculum is revised every
year to keep abreast of modern law
irends; however, the basic require
ments are never changed.
Required courses cover the whole
field of law, with which every stu
dent must have at least some ac
quaintance; however, electives are
offered to give students an opportu
nity to study in a special field of law.
Electives offered include public law,
commercial law and taxation laws.
During the first year two-thirds of
the courses are required, though only
half the courses are required during
the last two years.
Three years of college work must
precede admittance to the Law
School and a year in Law School
mlist be completed before the A.B.
Pre-Legal is granted. Upon comple
tion of the last two years in law
school an L.B. is granted; and if stu
dents wish to study another year
tihey may receive an MA. degree.
