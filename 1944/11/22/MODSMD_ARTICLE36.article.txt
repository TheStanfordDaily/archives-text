# Changes Planned By Men's Vocom
## 
### 
The presence of only two persons
last night at its first talk of the year
has caused Men's Vocom to com
pletely reorganize its plans for the
' quarter. Henceforth, there will be
[ no more formal talks until the com
i mittee is better organized, and more
J efficient planning can be done. It is
: for the attainment of this end that
! an open meeting will be held in the
. Nitery at 4:00 p.m. next Tuesday.
"All students who are interested
1 in Men's Vocom and who have any
! ideas to offer are urged to attend,"
j according to Jordan Peckham, chair
-1 man. Peckham further stated that
j Dr. Paul Farnsworth, acting head of
j the Department of Psychology and
I of the Faculty Vocational Guidance
Committee, will attend.
'"Vocom will send representatives
to house meetings of the various liv
ing groups in the future in order to
determine what fields of work are in
j greatest demand by the students,
j and whether or not students would
j be interested in hearing talks on
j these subjects. If you are interested,
! it is important that you attend next
! Tuesday's meeting, which will begin
; at four and adjourn at five," said
Elliot Epsteen, publicity chairman.
The committee is also planning to
attend the next Women's Vocom
! meeting in order to find out what
possibilities there are of co-operative
effort between the two groups.
