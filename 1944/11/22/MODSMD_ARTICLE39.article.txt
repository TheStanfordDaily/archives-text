# WAR FRONTS

### 
The German left is caving more
and more. The French have now
turned the whole Belfort gap, and
with it, the Vosges passes. Now they
have the problem of pushing through
the Black Forest, which is a good
defensive line and does not have
many good roads.
What might happen, however, is
that General Patton may bring his
army up to the Rhine, taking up the
French right, before the Germans
can stabilize their defenses there.
After being reinforced, he could
cross the river in the center of its
length and turn this area. He would
be following the Napoleonic inva
sion route of 1805.
Turn from South?
This brings the possibility into
mind that the German defenses may
be turned from the south instead of
the north. This was not evident be
fore, since this front was relatively
quiet. The Germans might, how
ever, have weakened their defenses
around the Belfort gap to reinforce
their lines farther to the north, and
thus have made the recent French
armored movement feasible.
Another possibility is that both
German wings will collapse while
the First and Ninth armies pin down
the enemy center. This would lever
the Germans well inland, and the
only Nazi counter would be to
weaken their eastern front to the
danger point.
Meanwhile the enemy is still be
ing pushed about in the Balkans.
Marshal Tito's forces, having cap
tured Belgrade, are now in a posi
tion to pivot westward and trap the
Germans retreating from Greece.
The fate of these divisions depends
upon Tito's strength and the ability
of the British to press the with
drawing forces.
