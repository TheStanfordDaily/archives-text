With the last big day in national
lootball for the 1944 season coming
up, (he Daily's five ghost football
experts got together in their swel
tering corner of the nether regions
again yesterday to prognosticate on
the weekend's grid menu.
The experts' chances of ever get
ting back to earth were considerably
diminished when the following com
munique was released alter the
stormy session, during which Gordo
Levy slopt soundly and thus missed
the Tun.
Coast
HSC to cinch the Rose Bowl bid,
edging out UCLA by 7 in a darned
good game. Weinberg held out for
the Bruins, as usual.
St. Mary's PF to wallop the hap
less Bears by 20 .
Texas Tech over SMU by 7, Gugel
protesting.
TCU over Rice by 7. to grab the
Southwest championship.
Oklahoma A & M over Oklahoma
by 13.
Tulsa to down Arkansas by 7, Gu
uel for the hogs as usual.
Western
Minnesota to squeeze out Wiscon
sin by 3.
Illinois over Northwestern by 14.
Ohio State to corner the Western
Conference crown, downing Michi
gan by 7. Best game of the week.
Purdue over Indiana by 6, Adams
and Gugel out. Anything can hap
pen in the big game.
East
Penn over Cornell by 14. Gugel
saying anything can happen in this
big game, too. It will have if his pre
diction of Cornell is correct.
Dartmouth to beat Columbia by 12,
Gugel off the deep end again.
Yale over Virginia by 2, Adams
and Cohen saying the Elis will be
knocked from the undefeated list.
Georgia Tech over Notre Dame by
10, Adams expecting the Irish to re
cover.
Tennessee over Kentucky by 14 in
the annual lootball "civil war."
One More
Levy's name was added to those
who might as well get used to the
heat this week when he failed to pre
dict, due to an overdose of Satan's
best morphine with which he intend
ed to obtain a foresight on the games.
Gugel's Hollywood Park racing tip
was no good, so it looks like Jimmy's
the only one due for a release.
