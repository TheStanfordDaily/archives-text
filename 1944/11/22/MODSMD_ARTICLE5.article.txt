Stanford students begin counting the hours thus morning as the four
day Thanksgiving vacation nears and the Li'l Injun nods in his 8 o'clock,
muttering, "116 hours, 21 minutes and 53 seconds of freedom."
Inhabitants of the Farm are a close-mouthed bunch, however. Ask
them what plans they have for these hours and most of them give Bull

Farm Laments
A Stanford rough with unhappy
eyes approached. He didn't get that
j cottage down at Carmel. Reason:
'The friend of one of the guys in the
| house (he meant the friend) who was
going to get the group the cottage,
well, this guy (he meant the friend)
i got a letter from his girl who'd been
his girl for five years and bigosh
his girl had just married a marine,
j so the guy hopped a plane down, to
: San Diego and so, no cottage for
Thanksgiving." Tough one, all right.

And when the reporter's assign
ment sheet at the Daily was exam
ined, the words of the managing
editor appeared:
"If you wanta know about meâ€”
turkeys, heck! I'm going to sleep the
whole *$'.'!z&!! time!"
Others Make Plans
Rank energy steamed from Sammy
Huston's statement that she was
going duck hunting in the Sacra

Yet the greatest joy of all shone from
a Daily staff member's face when she

young university scholars, while the
Monroe Mole, last reported halt dead
in the Libe, commented: "I'm return
ins; to my burrough on the Stockton
waterfront to prepare for my coming
tea, which will be the biggest social
event of the season."'
Me? I'm going to practice lighting
fires by rubbing two issues of Chap
arral together . . .
