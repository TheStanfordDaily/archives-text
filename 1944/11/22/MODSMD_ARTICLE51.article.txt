# Dr. Buck Clarifies Dumbarton Oaks Plan
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
(Editor's note: This is the fifth
in a series of interviews on the
postwar world.)

Rather than one all-purpose or
ganization, the Dumbarton Oaks
plan and other current plans such
as the World Bank provide for a
series of agencies to deal with a
series of problems, said Dr. Philip !
W. Buck. Professor of Political Sci
ence and authority on contemporary
government.
"It is by no means the final draft
of our postwar organization, but it i
is very likely to shape the final pat
tern, and is an excellent indication
as to what our final plan will be.
'The chief concern of the Dum
barton Oaks plan is peace, and its
chief agency will be the Security
Council,"he continued. "Perma
nent members will be the Big Four,
England. Russia, China, and the j
United States, and 'in due course
France. Six temporary members
will be elected to it by the General 1
Assembly which will represent all
nations.
I'eace Not Only Issue
This same plan provides for an
Economic and Social Policy Coun
cil, as well as suggesting various i
other agencies whose details have |
been or will be worked out by other .
conferences. Thus the Bretton
Woods Conference has planned a I

! World Fund and World Bank to aid
j currency relationships and the flow
I of development capital between na
tions. Civil aviation and oil sup
„plic\s called for two more agencies;
| and there will probably be other
| conferences to consider regulation of
j wheat, rubber, tin, and similar com
-1 modifies.
Wilson's League of Nations was an
! association of states to handle any
i and all problems. Twenty-five years
j later we are setting up practical
i agencies to deal with the most ur
gent problems. "The test of an ur
i gent problem is whether or not gov
ernments and the citizens they rep
resent consider it urgent," said Dr.
Buck. "As additional issues are
classified as urgent, the world or
ganization will grow bit by bit."
Not Final Draft
This preliminary Dumbarton Draft
will probably be modified and
adopted by a general conference of
the United Nations this spring or
summer, and then will go to the var
ious countries for ratification. Un
doubtedly it will have to go through
a series of such conferences before
it is generally acceptable; perhaps
not until the end of the war will it
be adopted.
But in several ways it may be
more acceptable than the League ot
Nations Covenant.
It does not say "We must organ
ize," but "We must solve these prob

lems: peace, currency stabilization, j
social and economic adjustment, in- |
ternational aviation, international I
trade." Then it sets up specific
agencies to deal with these prob
lems.
Specific Plan
On such a basis the agencies will I
appeal to the customer in any coun- j
try. He has been through depres- I

I sions, inflations, and war; and he
I realizes something must be done.
\ Here is a specific purpose machine
\ he can understand, rather than an
I all-purpose miracle.
i It will appeal to nations because
they are not asked to give up their
j sovereignty completely. In joining
i the Security Council they yield only
i the power of unlimited armies, and
| that for their immediate good. In
j supporting the World Fund and
World Bank, they give up another
specific power, that of currency
I regulation. But they are not thus
j being subordinated.
I Separate from Treaty
One great advantage will be its
! recognition as a project quite sepa
| rate from the peace treaty. The
| League of Nations Covenant was
| drafted at the same time as the
! Treaty of Versailles, and was op
j posed by many an intelligent man
|as an instrument for enforcing a
j treaty he considered unjust. Here
! there will be no confusion of such
| issues. The Dumbarton Plan will
| be regarded as an instrument to pre
! vent the peace treaty from being in
i flexible and unjust.
By no means the smallest advan
tage is our additional experience.
Thirty years ago there had never
I been a world war, not even a gen-
I eral European war tor nearly a cen-
I tury. No one realized the necessity

i of working for our peace. But now
many of us have seen two world
j wars, and the vicious cycle of in
stability leading up to them. We
have the determination to make our
I precautions effective.
.Social Issues Dangerous
Not just governments, but the
! communities they represent must
back the postwar organization to
make it successful. But we may
adopt it enthusiastically without as
suring its success. For we are quite
apt to back our government in pre
venting war, but to ignore the less
obvious social conditions leading t
war. We may call them national
problems.
The real test of the organization
will come when it faces its first
crucial issue, perhaps ten years frorr
now when the world recalls only the
| "jolly war years," when everyone
had a job. We can only hope that
the big issue will come after a grad
ual buildup of smaller problems
that have been successfuliy solved
by the various agencies.
Success will not lie measured b>
j the force we can exert on a rebel -
I lious nation, but rather by the jus
j tice and satisfaction we give it. We
j must not say "You can't go to war,"
I but "Why do you want to go to
| war?" Peace will consist of moder
j ate compromises with force as a last
j resort.

Rather than one all-purpose or
ganization, the Dumbarton Oaks
plan and other current plans such
as the World Bank provide for a
series of agencies to deal with a
series of problems, said Dr. Philip !
W. Buck. Professor of Political Sci
ence and authority on contemporary
government.
"It is by no means the final draft
of our postwar organization, but it i
is very likely to shape the final pat
tern, and is an excellent indication
as to what our final plan will be.
'The chief concern of the Dum
barton Oaks plan is peace, and its
chief agency will be the Security
Council,"he continued. "Perma
nent members will be the Big Four,
England. Russia, China, and the j
United States, and 'in due course
France. Six temporary members
will be elected to it by the General 1
Assembly which will represent all
nations.
I'eace Not Only Issue
This same plan provides for an
Economic and Social Policy Coun
cil, as well as suggesting various i
other agencies whose details have |
been or will be worked out by other .
conferences. Thus the Bretton
Woods Conference has planned a I

! World Fund and World Bank to aid
j currency relationships and the flow
I of development capital between na
tions. Civil aviation and oil sup
„plic\s called for two more agencies;
| and there will probably be other
| conferences to consider regulation of
j wheat, rubber, tin, and similar com
-1 modifies.
Wilson's League of Nations was an
! association of states to handle any
i and all problems. Twenty-five years
j later we are setting up practical
i agencies to deal with the most ur
gent problems. "The test of an ur
i gent problem is whether or not gov
ernments and the citizens they rep
resent consider it urgent," said Dr.
Buck. "As additional issues are
classified as urgent, the world or
ganization will grow bit by bit."
Not Final Draft
This preliminary Dumbarton Draft
will probably be modified and
adopted by a general conference of
the United Nations this spring or
summer, and then will go to the var
ious countries for ratification. Un
doubtedly it will have to go through
a series of such conferences before
it is generally acceptable; perhaps
not until the end of the war will it
be adopted.
But in several ways it may be
more acceptable than the League ot
Nations Covenant.
It does not say "We must organ
ize," but "We must solve these prob

lems: peace, currency stabilization, j
social and economic adjustment, in- |
ternational aviation, international I
trade." Then it sets up specific
agencies to deal with these prob
lems.
Specific Plan
On such a basis the agencies will I
appeal to the customer in any coun- j
try. He has been through depres- I

I sions, inflations, and war; and he
I realizes something must be done.
\ Here is a specific purpose machine
\ he can understand, rather than an
I all-purpose miracle.
i It will appeal to nations because
they are not asked to give up their
j sovereignty completely. In joining
i the Security Council they yield only
i the power of unlimited armies, and
| that for their immediate good. In
j supporting the World Fund and
World Bank, they give up another
specific power, that of currency
I regulation. But they are not thus
j being subordinated.
I Separate from Treaty
One great advantage will be its
! recognition as a project quite sepa
| rate from the peace treaty. The
| League of Nations Covenant was
| drafted at the same time as the
! Treaty of Versailles, and was op
j posed by many an intelligent man
|as an instrument for enforcing a
j treaty he considered unjust. Here

adopted by a general conference of
the United Nations this spring or
summer, and then will go to the var
ious countries for ratification. Un
doubtedly it will have to go through
a series of such conferences before
it is generally acceptable; perhaps
not until the end of the war will it
be adopted.
But in several ways it may be
more acceptable than the League ot
Nations Covenant.
It does not say "We must organ
ize," but "We must solve these prob

lems: peace, currency stabilization, j
social and economic adjustment, in- |
ternational aviation, international I
trade." Then it sets up specific
agencies to deal with these prob
lems.
Specific Plan
On such a basis the agencies will I
appeal to the customer in any coun- j
try. He has been through depres- I

I sions, inflations, and war; and he
I realizes something must be done.
\ Here is a specific purpose machine
\ he can understand, rather than an
I all-purpose miracle.
i It will appeal to nations because
they are not asked to give up their
j sovereignty completely. In joining
i the Security Council they yield only
i the power of unlimited armies, and
| that for their immediate good. In
j supporting the World Fund and
World Bank, they give up another
specific power, that of currency
I regulation. But they are not thus
j being subordinated.
I Separate from Treaty
One great advantage will be its
! recognition as a project quite sepa
| rate from the peace treaty. The
| League of Nations Covenant was
| drafted at the same time as the
! Treaty of Versailles, and was op
j posed by many an intelligent man
|as an instrument for enforcing a
j treaty he considered unjust. Here
! there will be no confusion of such
| issues. The Dumbarton Plan will
| be regarded as an instrument to pre
! vent the peace treaty from being in
i flexible and unjust.
By no means the smallest advan
tage is our additional experience.
Thirty years ago there had never
I been a world war, not even a gen-
I eral European war tor nearly a cen-
I tury. No one realized the necessity

i of working for our peace. But now
many of us have seen two world
j wars, and the vicious cycle of in
stability leading up to them. We
have the determination to make our
I precautions effective.
.Social Issues Dangerous
Not just governments, but the
! communities they represent must
back the postwar organization to
make it successful. But we may
adopt it enthusiastically without as
suring its success. For we are quite
apt to back our government in pre
venting war, but to ignore the less
obvious social conditions leading t
war. We may call them national
problems.
The real test of the organization
will come when it faces its first
crucial issue, perhaps ten years frorr
now when the world recalls only the
| "jolly war years," when everyone
had a job. We can only hope that
the big issue will come after a grad
ual buildup of smaller problems
that have been successfuliy solved
by the various agencies.
Success will not lie measured b>
j the force we can exert on a rebel -
I lious nation, but rather by the jus
j tice and satisfaction we give it. We
j must not say "You can't go to war,"
I but "Why do you want to go to
| war?" Peace will consist of moder
j ate compromises with force as a last
j resort.

Rather than one all-purpose or

plan and other current plans such
as the World Bank provide for a

series of problems, said Dr. Philip !

"It is by no means the final draft
of our postwar organization, but it i
is very likely to shape the final pat
tern, and is an excellent indication
