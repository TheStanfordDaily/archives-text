m. Mr
ALLIED HDQ., LEYTE, Nov. 22 (U.R)â€”Japanese resistance inside the
shell-torn "Limon pocket" of Northern Leyte is nearing the breaking
point and hard-fighting American doughboys have killed more than 500
Japanese trying to rescue the trapped garrison, front dispatches reported
today.
General Douglas Mac Arthur's daily war bulletin meanwhile revealed
for the first time that American heavy bombers were operating from
Leyte airfields and had destroyed supply dumps and crippled vessels in a
raid on the west coast port of Palomton, 20 miles southeast of Limon.
The bulletin said that the United States 32nd Division was meeting
unrelenting pressure on the "Limon pocket," where some 3,000 Japanese
of the crack First Division have been trapped for more than a week.
Mac Arthur said that the rugged terrain was ideally suited for defen.se,
and was forcing his field commanders to use time-consuming tactics in
order to crush enemy resistance with a minimum of American losses.
