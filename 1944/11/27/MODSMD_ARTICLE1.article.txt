No "Big Game"
Formerly the Gaieties were called j
the "Big Game Gaieties." For the j
past two years, however, Stanford j
has gone on to present a sparkling I
show of music, skits and dances '
without the prefix, mainly as a re- 1
suit of the conspicuous absence of a I
"Big Game."
According to Peggy Fitts, who now j
has her cast working night and day
in her capacity as director of the '44
Gaieties, the show is shaping up well,
and campus talent has gone all out
to make this one of the biggest re
vues to hit the Farm yet.
Crew Carries On
The technical crew, under Corky
Wollman and Mickey Garmes, is put
ting the finishing touches on the j
scenery and props. Despite wartime j
material restrictions, the sets have I
been carefully constructed on large ,
scales and problems range from the !
design and construction of huge j
backdrops and complicated sets to j
pocket handkerchiefs and snoods.
Musical direction is under Jackie !
Herr, Army pre-med student of En- |
cina, who is also the leader of the j
popular "Dabblers in Swing," Army
swing band. Bob Payne, another I
Army student, is doing arrangements ]
for the show. This is vaguly remi
niscent of last year's .show which was j
called the "GI Varieties," and fea- i
tured several of the several thousand j
talented AST men then stationed on j
campus.
Original Songs Featured
Original songs written especially i
for Gaieties by Stanford students will j
be presented, as well as other favo- I
rites. The curtain will go up to an ,
opener from the pen of Leslie Alex- |
ander, who is also a vocalist with
the show.
Dances are under the direction of
Janice Shaughnessy, who has pre
pared tap routines, modern dance ef- I
fects, boogie-woogie, Latin - Ameri- !
can, and blues numbers for this fall's j
show. Feet will fly as the dancing j
cast swing out to the tuneful melo- j
dies, new and old, which will spark j
the show.
