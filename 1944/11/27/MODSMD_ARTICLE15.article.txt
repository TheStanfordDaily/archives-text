# BUNGLING THE DATES
## 
### 
.Monday night was a big night for campus ac
tivities—too big! The genial Stanford Indian got
a couple of black eyes that will take more than
beefsteak to erase. Why? Maybe you can solve
the problem!
On the calendar for Monday were:
(1) A talk for all campus women by Dr. Mag
aret at Memorial Hall.
(2) The regular meetings for campus fresh
men in their respective halls.
(3) A meeting of the Hot Jazz Society.
(4) A Gaieties rehearsal.
(5) The Stanford Discussion Union talks.
(6) Men's Vocom talk on vocational survey.
Consequently, two men showed up for the
Vocom talk. There should have been at least
fifty. Two lonesome individuals attended the
Discussion Union talks. Many more were ex
pected. Speakers of both groups were very dis
appointed. In fact, meetings ior each have been
postponed for the rest of the quarter.
Is it because Stanford students lack interest
in vocational guidance and discussion of polit
ical problems? Is it because they didn't hear
about the meetings? Were Stanfordites too
loaded down with studies? Maybe, but we
think not.
We believe the fault in poor attendance was
due to lack of proper planning and checking on
the part of the chairmen and Ex-com. Were all
these events cleared through Ex-com? Did all
committee heads realize the number of other ac
tivities scheduled for that night?
We're not trying to pin the blame on anyone
for the sad case of the Monday night conflicts.
We want, however, to be sure in the future that
speakers invited to campus meetings are as
sured a reasonable audience! We want no more
black eyes for the Stanford Indian!— Bill Eilers.
