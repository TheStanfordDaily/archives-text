# THE 						SIXTH AND BIG ONE
## 
### 
It's only so many months now, and maybe
nst weeks, to V-Day on at least one of the major
ronts, and we're rather used to the idea already.
As the campu3 launches into the Sixth War

Loan drive today it is going to be easy to ignore
the customary appeals. There is nothing to say
about this drive that was not said about the
other five; and things are more favorable now .. .
it's near the end of the guarter . . . we're broke.
The whole organization to support the sys
tematic purchase of stamps and bonds on cam
pus has deteriorated. From purchases of a stamp
every Wednesday, we have come to a whole
sale signup for the guarter to take the nasty obli
gation from our minds. The latest is to make a
pledge to drop around some time in the guarter
and get our guota from the bond booth.
An obligation of decency should determine
our participation in the Sixth War Loan drive.
Stanford should contribute at least a bond for
each student. Each student knows well the ulti
mate seriousness of this cause which lies behind
the high-powered press agentry and heroics that
our academic minds snobbishly dismiss.
Let's get Stanford out of a false and dangerous
apathy towards the world beyond the pillars of
the Quad, by supporting the Sixth War Loan
drive—especially if it hurts—and until it hurts.
—Giannini.
