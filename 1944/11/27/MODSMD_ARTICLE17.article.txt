# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
Things were so damn quiet here over the
vacation that if someone had "burped" out loud
while walking down Quad, they would have
been arrested by Chief Davis for disturbing the
peace. In the following paragraphs, I shall try
to tell you what it is like on the dear old Stan
ford campus when everyone who has any sense
gets the hell out of here, and leaves a few
simple souls in an abyss of misery and despair.
The vacation really started on Wednesday,
with students leaving the campus by every
method of movement. At nightfall, the place
was practically deserted. No students going to
wards Paly for the show, no one whipping down
the highway for a few short ones as a pleasant
relief from the evening's work.
Thanksgiving day really opened up the Stan
ford morgue for next four dismal days. I walked
into the Cellar for breakfast and it was surpris
ing to note that a civilian really looked out of
place, as the C. A. T. S. and G. I.'s had really
taken over. It really reminded me of a Post
Exchange.
After a military breakfast, I went up to the
P. 0., and there wasn't a soul standing in the
doorway, and I was amazed to find that I could
get clear inside the post office and not even
lose an arm.
After leaving this busy scene, I wandered
down the "Row," and here was the same circum
stance that had been coming before my eyes all
morning. Not a person could be seen. Not even
a Kappa-DeeGee brawl was being presented for
the benefit of interested spectators.
I then threw in the towel and went home and
played solitaire until lunch. After lunch, I had
an exciting nap until 4:30 and then went over
and hashed for the soldiers, who probably had
one of the finest turkey dinners that Uncle Sam
could devise.
After hashing, went home, played more cards
until I became so bored that I started cheating
myself and decided it was time to quit. So
ended an exciting holiday.
I have, by now, read Time, Life, Newsweek,
Post, Colliers, Esquire, tried to laugh at the corny
jokes of Chaparral's last issue, and even tried
to study.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday were practi
cally the same as Thanksgiving, only worse. By
this time, I am so envious of all you people who
went away, that I hope you broke your leg at
Yosemite, or got hit with a Martini glass at the
Grove, or perhaps got knifed at the"Club Ala
bam."
So ends your old Bull Sessiotier's first and
last vacation that will be spent on the Stanford
campus; also the first and last column that will
contain the "My Day" technique. All in all, I'm
sure "glad to see ya!"

Grove, or perhaps got knifed at the"Club Ala
bam."
So ends your old Bull Sessiotier's first and
last vacation that will be spent on the Stanford
campus; also the first and last column that will
contain the "My Day" technique. All in all, I'm
sure "glad to see ya!"
Things were so damn quiet here over the
vacation that if someone had "burped" out loud
while walking down Quad, they would have
been arrested by Chief Davis for disturbing the
peace. In the following paragraphs, I shall try
to tell you what it is like on the dear old Stan
ford campus when everyone who has any sense
gets the hell out of here, and leaves a few
simple souls in an abyss of misery and despair.
The vacation really started on Wednesday,
with students leaving the campus by every
method of movement. At nightfall, the place
was practically deserted. No students going to
wards Paly for the show, no one whipping down
the highway for a few short ones as a pleasant
relief from the evening's work.
Thanksgiving day really opened up the Stan
ford morgue for next four dismal days. I walked
into the Cellar for breakfast and it was surpris
ing to note that a civilian really looked out of
place, as the C. A. T. S. and G. I.'s had really
taken over. It really reminded me of a Post
Exchange.
After a military breakfast, I went up to the
P. 0., and there wasn't a soul standing in the
doorway, and I was amazed to find that I could
get clear inside the post office and not even
lose an arm.
After leaving this busy scene, I wandered
down the "Row," and here was the same circum
stance that had been coming before my eyes all
morning. Not a person could be seen. Not even
a Kappa-DeeGee brawl was being presented for
the benefit of interested spectators.
I then threw in the towel and went home and
played solitaire until lunch. After lunch, I had
an exciting nap until 4:30 and then went over
and hashed for the soldiers, who probably had
one of the finest turkey dinners that Uncle Sam
could devise.
After hashing, went home, played more cards
until I became so bored that I started cheating
myself and decided it was time to quit. So
ended an exciting holiday.
I have, by now, read Time, Life, Newsweek,
Post, Colliers, Esquire, tried to laugh at the corny
jokes of Chaparral's last issue, and even tried
to study.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday were practi
cally the same as Thanksgiving, only worse. By
this time, I am so envious of all you people who
went away, that I hope you broke your leg at
Yosemite, or got hit with a Martini glass at the
Grove, or perhaps got knifed at the"Club Ala
bam."
