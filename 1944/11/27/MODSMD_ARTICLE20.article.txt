# Saturday Hike Proves Treat
## 
### 
About twenty Farm students at
tended the hike led by Dr. Donald
B. Tresidder, Saturday afternoon
Mary Lou McClure, in charge of the
affair, said yesterday. Accompanying
the hikers was Hilmer Oehlmann,
manager of the Yosemite Co. "The
weather was superb, and everyone
had a good time," she remarked.
Loaded with cameras, the group
started at 1:30 at Frenchman's Bridge
and hiked back over the hills to Felt
Lake, where they sat on the shore
and discussed "everything from poli
tics to why they came to Stanford,"
Miss McClure said. They came out
of the hills near the old Isolation
Home and at Lagunita Lake about
5 p.m.
"We hope to have at least one
more similar hike, and maybe two,
the weather permitting," Miss Mc-
Clure said. "We hope subsequent
hikes will be as successful as this
one."
