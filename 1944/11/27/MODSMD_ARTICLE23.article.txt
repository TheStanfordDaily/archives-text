# Kimbrough Shakes Dust From 1910 Atmosphere
## 
### MARY AL SMITH 
Picture an open touring car—l9lo
model—booming along Palm Drive
at 13 m.p.h. The graying driver,
armored in a long linen coat and a
cap with a visor, squeezes the black
rubber bulb (which the horn)
between his elboyf - length leather
gantlets.
Picture also dangling from the side
of the automobile a butterfly net—a
ready home for unsuspecting Mon
arehs—and you will have an idea of
the atmosphere which has invaded
Emily Kimbrough's latest book,
"How Dear to My Heart," which left
the presses the middle of this month.
Life in Muncie
"H. D. t. M. H." describes Emily's
life in Muncie, Delaware county seat,
Indiana, during the fii'st decade of
this century, when her grandfather
drove the first automobile in town
and he.drove it through the butcher
shop window.
Surviving this christening of shat
tering glass and the frequent ston
ings which it received on country
roads, the automobile radiator was
decorated with a big brass monogram
reading CMK (the pilot's initials.)
The monogram was an anniversary
gift.
Frank on a Gunboat
Emily's personal equipment for
rides in grandfather's automobile in
cluded a kind of helmet with a ven
tilator in front and a pipeline going
into it. This helmet, confides Miss
Kimbrough, failed to keep out the
major particles of dust, dirt and
fumes.
But all of Emily's time was not
spent in the hiccoughing 1910 model,
however, as she enjoyed reading the
exploits of "Frank before Vicks
burg," and "Frank on the Lower
Mississippi," both of the "Frank on
a Gunboat" series, which will be re
called by literature lovers.
"High Tippy Bob -Royal"
Then there was great grandmother
Curry—great grandmother, reading
Emily the jokes from the back page
of the Christian Advocate, which
came every Thursday without fail;
and great grandmother, conversing
with Emily in their private code by
which people who put on many airs
were considered "high tippy bob
I'oyal."
Few would suspect that little
Emily had a philosophy of life. But
she did have one and it might be

called a fence philosophy. For on
Mr. Cassidy, the flute player's fence,
she tallied in chalk her good and bad
times, keeping a graph of current
events. Her firm belief, found in her
early years, was that when "some
thing nice happened there would
follow something unfortunate" and
vice versa.
A New Additiou
And just for the record, Emily
says when a negative response fol
lowed her Thanksgiving day retort,
"Shades of defunct lawn-mowers, I
believe I will have some more tur
key!" she was discouraged from fur
ther humorous intent.
And also for the record, was Emily
(I always call her Emily) discour
aged? ''
In conclusion, there is a poignant
first meeting with her equally new
and resented baby brother, who was
a Christmas day surprise. But, and
then she remembered, she liked sur
prises.

ready home for unsuspecting Mon
arehs—and you will have an idea of
the atmosphere which has invaded
Emily Kimbrough's latest book,
"How Dear to My Heart," which left
the presses the middle of this month.
Life in Muncie
"H. D. t. M. H." describes Emily's
life in Muncie, Delaware county seat,
Indiana, during the fii'st decade of
this century, when her grandfather
drove the first automobile in town
and he.drove it through the butcher
shop window.
Surviving this christening of shat
tering glass and the frequent ston
ings which it received on country
roads, the automobile radiator was
decorated with a big brass monogram
reading CMK (the pilot's initials.)
The monogram was an anniversary
gift.
Frank on a Gunboat
Emily's personal equipment for
rides in grandfather's automobile in
cluded a kind of helmet with a ven
tilator in front and a pipeline going
into it. This helmet, confides Miss
Kimbrough, failed to keep out the
major particles of dust, dirt and
fumes.
But all of Emily's time was not
spent in the hiccoughing 1910 model,
however, as she enjoyed reading the
exploits of "Frank before Vicks
burg," and "Frank on the Lower
Mississippi," both of the "Frank on
a Gunboat" series, which will be re
called by literature lovers.
"High Tippy Bob -Royal"
Then there was great grandmother
Curry—great grandmother, reading
Emily the jokes from the back page
of the Christian Advocate, which
came every Thursday without fail;
and great grandmother, conversing
with Emily in their private code by
which people who put on many airs
were considered "high tippy bob
I'oyal."
Few would suspect that little
Emily had a philosophy of life. But
she did have one and it might be

called a fence philosophy. For on
Mr. Cassidy, the flute player's fence,
she tallied in chalk her good and bad
times, keeping a graph of current
events. Her firm belief, found in her
early years, was that when "some
thing nice happened there would
follow something unfortunate" and
vice versa.
A New Additiou
And just for the record, Emily
says when a negative response fol
lowed her Thanksgiving day retort,
"Shades of defunct lawn-mowers, I
believe I will have some more tur
key!" she was discouraged from fur
ther humorous intent.
And also for the record, was Emily
(I always call her Emily) discour
aged? ''
In conclusion, there is a poignant
first meeting with her equally new
and resented baby brother, who was
a Christmas day surprise. But, and
then she remembered, she liked sur
prises.
Picture an open touring car—l9lo
model—booming along Palm Drive
at 13 m.p.h. The graying driver,
armored in a long linen coat and a
cap with a visor, squeezes the black
rubber bulb (which the horn)
between his elboyf - length leather
gantlets.
Picture also dangling from the side
of the automobile a butterfly net—a
ready home for unsuspecting Mon
arehs—and you will have an idea of
the atmosphere which has invaded
Emily Kimbrough's latest book,
