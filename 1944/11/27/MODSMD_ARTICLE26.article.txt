MR. SKEFFINGTON—Now playing
at the Varsity Theater.
Once again we go through life
with "Oxydol's own,"' Bette Davis,
as she and the audience grow older
in the process of "Mr. Skeffington."
This time Bette has a rather coquet
tish role and spends the best years
of her life in search of the right man.

La Davis is being
courted by Walter
Abel, Jerome Co
wan, and everyone
else on the War
nets' lot as the
picture begins, but
rfinally is attracted
to Skeffington,
played by Claude
Rains, a modest,
unassuming busi
nessman. Even af
ter their marriage

Miss Davis can't stand the rigors of
home life and engages in some rather
drab affairs with bootleggers, visit
ing firemen and the such. Finally,
Bette gets a well-earned divorce.
But as fickle Follywood (some
times called Hollywood) will have it,
the aging Miss Davis contracts pneu
monia and her womanly charms are
destroyed. She resorts to psychia
trists to restore the old "come-on"
but evenetully becomes reunited
with her former husband when he
returns from a German concentra
tion camp. By that time she is about
70 and it makes little difference.
"Mr. Skeffington" is a long, te
dious picture that does have some
excellent moments. The musical
score is compelling but make-up
seems very harsh. This is certainly
not one of Bette Davis's best pic
tures.
The second feature is Paramount's
"I Love a Soldier," another of these
things in which the serviceman
(Sonny Tufts) can't decide whether
to marry the girl (Paulette God
dard.) The couple spends 107 minutes
in deciding and then they take the
fateful step only at the point of a
loaded shotgun. Barry Fitzgerald has
a minor role as a Powell Street
cable-car operator.—Dick Bower.
