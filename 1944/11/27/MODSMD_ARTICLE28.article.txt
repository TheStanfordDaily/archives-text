# Ruff, Campus Pet, Takes Fifteen Units
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Sociology, psychology and history
of the middle ages, those 15 units are
enough for any dog. And those are
the courses that Ru(T Glass attends
five times a week with his master,
Edward Glass. He seems to enjoy
them thoroughly.
Only a few months ago Ruff had
no idea that he would soon be a
Stanford dog. For he was then in
training at the Seeing Eye School
at Morristown, N. J. Then he met
Edward Glass, his master-to-be. To
gether the two of them graduated
from Morristown and were ready to
meet the world.
They make a good pair, Ed's long,
confident stride matching Ruff's fast
pace, and there will never be a bet
ter pair of pals.
The only place Ruff doesn't seem
to fit is on the dance floor. How

ever hard he may try, he just can't i
match his master there. So on Sat
urday nights he has to stay at home,
much to his chagrin. But he does
enjoy the bones he gets for consola- !
tion.
Another accomplishment Ruff has I
to leave to his master is doing the ;
homework. He can listen to the as
signment being read, but he can't j
seem to handle a typewriter. But Ed |
claims Ruff is just auditing anyway, i
and doesn't care.
They're majoring in sociology, I
those two, and have definite plans for !
using it when they graduate two
years from now. Ed hopes eventu
ally to do some graduate work, but
first he is going into Veteran's Ad
ministration work. He feels there
will be a great deal of rehabilitation
work to be done and he and Ruff
will be in there pitching.
