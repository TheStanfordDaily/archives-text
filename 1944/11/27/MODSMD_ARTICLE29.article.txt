# Men To Choose Speakers Tonight for Vocom Talks
## 
### 
Scheduling a survey of freshmen occupational interests, Men's Vocom
tonight is sending representatives to the men's hall meetings to interview
the men on their choice of vocational speakers to be invited to the campus
for the coming year.
Jordan Peckham, chairman, will present the results of these interviews

to the Men's Vocom meeting tomor
row at 4 in the Nitery. Formal talks
for the remainder of this quarter
have been disbanded by newly re
organized Men's Vocom because of
lack of interest shown at the first
talk a week ago.
Men to Visit Women
Immediately after the 4 p.m. meet
ing, the Men's committee will at
tend the Women's Vocom confer
ence in order to bring about closer
cooperation between the two organi
zations in inviting speakers and in
creasing attendance at the talks.
Perhaps the first two fields to be
covered will be law and education
as a result of the statement made by
the committee's first speaker, Na
than F. Newcomer, veteran's repre
sentative of the War Manpower
Commission. Newcomer stated that
law and education have the greatest
postwar future of all careers.
Plans Interviews
After the talks next quarter, Men's
Vocom also plans to arrange indi
vidual interviews between faculty
members and students to promote
more efficient vocational guidance.
Use of the Strong Vocational Inter
est test will also be recommended to
students in choosing their careers.
The committee is considering a
subscription to the pamphlet "Science
Survey" to further use of vocational
statistics.
Peckham. a law major, was ap
pointed chairman of Men's Vocom
by Barbara White when Ex-Com
suggested the need for the commit
tee's reorganization following in
creased attendance and return of
more veterans to Stanford.
