### 
PARIS, Monday, Nov. 27 (U.R)â€”Lt.
Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army
ripping through the old Maginot line
on a 40-mile front, seized one of
Germany's great Saar Valley muni
tion plants Sunday while the U. S.
First Army captured the fortified
factory town of Weisweiler on the
'Adolph Hitler" highway to Cologne.
The arsenal, believed one of the
vital cogs in the German military
machine, was captured near Bouzon
ville in Lorraine, three miles from
the Saar border. More than one
million shells were scattered over its
ten acres, but the Germans had evac
uated most of'the heavy machinery.
Patton's nine divisions captured
ten Maginot forts in gains up to eight
miles, smashing the first resistance
yet to be encountered from the
French border defense line which
had been reversed by the Germans
to meet the drive from the west.
