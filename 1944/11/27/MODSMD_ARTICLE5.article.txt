ALLIED HDQ., LEYTE, PHILIP
PINES, Monday. Nov. 27 (U.R) â€” Japa
nese resistance in Ormoc corrridor
of northwestern Leyte is weakening
under the hammer blows of Ameri
can infantry and artillery, and U. S.
warplanes have sunk three more en
emy ships apparently trying to rush
supplies and reinforcements to the
enemy's battered 35th army, it was
announced today.
General Douglas Mac-Arthur's
daily war bulletin announced that
Maj. Gen. William H. Gill's 32nd
Division resumed its drive southward
along the highway toward the main
Japanese stronghold port of Ormoc
after easily turning back a light en
emy counterattack Sunday.
Front reports placed them within
18 miles north of Ormoc.
