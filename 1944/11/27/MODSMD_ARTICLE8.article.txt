# Comedy in Irish Brogue Will Open December 6
## 
### 
"Faith, Patrick, are you after havin' a little more sugar for your tuy?"
Or words to that effect. The Greeks may have a word for it, but the Irish
have a brogue. And that brogue is one of the chief problems over which
the cast of Stanford Players appearing in "Is Life Worth Living?" is cur
rently struggling.

The ultimate result is an Irish dia
lect, pure and simple, or at least a
"daycent" facsimile of the same.
There are times, however, when both
director Norman Philbrick and cast
feel that any resemblance to true
Irish characters, living or dead, is
little better than coincidental.
Accents Not Universal
Fortunately for the sanity of all
concerned, not all of the characters
in the corning production have to de
velop an accent. De La Mare Stock
Company, represented through Con
stantia and Hector, played by Sally
Stocker and George Crane, are not
in the Irish way. They have invaded
Inish to present the serious dramas
of Russia and Scandinavia to the
peaceful citizens of the Irish seaside
resort. Though slightly uncured
"ham," nevertheless they make such
a profound impression on the good
Celts that the whole town is on the
verge of homicide, patricide, matri
cide, infanticide, suicide, and other
assorted crimes.
Other Characters Irish
The worthy citizens of Inish who
are twisting their tongues around a
thick brogue are such characters as
John Twohig, played by Martin Nel
der, who owns the inn where the
actors stay; Annie, his wife, played
by Mary Martin, who sounds as
though her brogue was bred in
County Cork, and Lizzie Twohig,
played by Mary Higgins, who sud
denly realizes that she has been re
pressed all her life.
The play is coming to the Little
Theater December 6 to 11. It is
written by Lennox Robinson, a mod
ern writer of Irish comedy, whose
"Far-Off Hills" was presented here
a few seasons ago.
