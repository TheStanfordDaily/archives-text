## 
### 
Machinery of the Stanford War Bond Committee will swing into high
gear today when Branner and Roble women make their appearance on the
four corners of the Quad to sell War Bonds as part of the nation-wide
Sixth War Loan drive.
Re-echoing the opinion expressed in yesterday's Daily editorial column,

► War Board Coordinator Jeannette
t Grimsley urged support of the Sixth
! War Loan "especially if it hurts—
| and until it hurts."
Thermometer Records Sales
Bond booths will be open from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m. from today through
December 6 in an effort to meet the
$27,500 quota set for Stanford. A
; thermometer indicator near the Cel
lar will record the progress of the
: bond sales, according to Bond Chair
j man Mildred Edwards.
Emphasizing the importance of the
i success of the Sixth War Loan, the
U. S. Treasury Department spikes all
j rumors about the war being almost
, over. Victory in Germany may be
j near, but the Japanese war is a tre
j mendous undertaking, "and victory
| will come high."
Bonds Still Needed
I Greater forces, longer distances in
the Pacific will mean more cargo
[ ships, more B-29 Superfortresses at
$000,000 each; more P-47 Thunder
bolts that cost $50,000 each; more
I tanks, more aircraft carriers, more
gasoline and oil — and everything
; costs more in the Pacific war.
With the swing to the Pacific will
i come the need for more battalion aid
stations, more hospital ships, more
convalescent hospitals, more aid lor
disabled veterans.
Add to these the actual mainte
: nance cost of 11 to 12 million men
in the Army and Navy and there's
reason enough to contribute HEAV
ILY to the Sixth War Loan.
Winning the peace —for your coun
try and yourself—is included in the
Treasury Department call for bond
buyers. Money invested in war bonds
will prevent inflation and subsequent
! depression; money placed in
is "the world's safest investment."

Emphasizing the importance of the
i success of the Sixth War Loan, the
U. S. Treasury Department spikes all
j rumors about the war being almost
, over. Victory in Germany may be
j near, but the Japanese war is a tre
j mendous undertaking, "and victory
| will come high."
Bonds Still Needed
I Greater forces, longer distances in
the Pacific will mean more cargo
[ ships, more B-29 Superfortresses at
$000,000 each; more P-47 Thunder
bolts that cost $50,000 each; more
I tanks, more aircraft carriers, more
gasoline and oil — and everything
; costs more in the Pacific war.
With the swing to the Pacific will
i come the need for more battalion aid
stations, more hospital ships, more
convalescent hospitals, more aid lor
disabled veterans.
Add to these the actual mainte
: nance cost of 11 to 12 million men
in the Army and Navy and there's
reason enough to contribute HEAV
ILY to the Sixth War Loan.
Winning the peace —for your coun
try and yourself—is included in the
Treasury Department call for bond
buyers. Money invested in war bonds
will prevent inflation and subsequent
! depression; money placed in
is "the world's safest investment."
