# WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH SUSIE Q?
## 
### 
This is the story of Susy Q. Freshman and
her "orientation" to Stanford life.
Susy Q. arrives at Roble or Branner or Ven
tura or wherever she arrives, with a funda
mental and overpowering desire to get along;
to fit in, to conform. In corridor meetings and
house meetings and in unofficial talks with her
sponsors she is told that "Stanford women do
this and Stanford women do not do this," and
because she wants so badly to belong she does
as Stanford women do and she tells others, per
haps those she herself sponsors some day, what
it is that Stanford women do and do not do.
You say this is a very good thing; this is the
way we make Stanford women something
unigue, something above the out - of - ordinary
women. But you are wrong; it is a very bad
thing.
It is a very bad thing because nobody ever
tells Susy Q. Freshman, and Susy Q. Freshman
seldom asks herself WHY she must do this and
why she must nof do that. In fact, one of the
fundamental but little recognized principles of
Stanford womanhood is that they accept what
is told them by the proper authorities without
question and indeed consider it their chief vir
tue to do so.
Now this is not to say that there is anything
wrong in teaching Susy Q. that Stanford women
do not drink, and that Stanford women do not
walk out of the Cellar without paying their
checks, and that Stanford women do not go on
weekend house parties unchaperoned. It is
necessary, practical, and probably, on the
whole, right.
But they might just as easily be wrong, may
be only a little wrong or overzealous, as was
the business of administering technicals for
failure to attend Dr. Magaret's meeting last
week. But, wrong or right, it would be accepted
as "the thing to do" by all properly inculcated
Stanford women.
Here we have a strange paradox. Tradition
ally a university is the home of critical, self
questioning thought. And yet Stanford woman
hood is a creed, almost indeed a religion, based
fundamentally on an authoritarian system which
in its very nature places a premium on never
asking "Why?"
The problem is one of establishing a diffi
cult relationship between the necessary, prac
tical job of requiring something of Stanford
women, of making them people with a unique
and worthwhile orientation to just living and
'he converse necessity of making them also
ntelligent and self-critical.
Stanford's system of creating out of the
•reshman's desire to belong a self-perpetuating
oody of believers in the cult of Stanford wom
anhood seems of itself to defeat the latter aim
?f critical thinking and thereby to make impos

sible the former, that is a truly worthwhile orien
tation to living.
If, instead of telling Susy Q. Freshman what
Stanford women do and do not do, we told her
why Stanford women seem to think they should
do this and not that, and encouraged her to
think whether she herself believed in it, and if
not, why not, then perhaps—only perhaps, of
course—we would be shooting more in the di
rection of both aims.—Nancy Tilden.

why she must nof do that. In fact, one of the
fundamental but little recognized principles of
Stanford womanhood is that they accept what
is told them by the proper authorities without
question and indeed consider it their chief vir
tue to do so.
Now this is not to say that there is anything
wrong in teaching Susy Q. that Stanford women
do not drink, and that Stanford women do not
walk out of the Cellar without paying their
checks, and that Stanford women do not go on
weekend house parties unchaperoned. It is
necessary, practical, and probably, on the
whole, right.
But they might just as easily be wrong, may
be only a little wrong or overzealous, as was
the business of administering technicals for
failure to attend Dr. Magaret's meeting last
week. But, wrong or right, it would be accepted
as "the thing to do" by all properly inculcated
Stanford women.
Here we have a strange paradox. Tradition
ally a university is the home of critical, self
questioning thought. And yet Stanford woman
hood is a creed, almost indeed a religion, based
fundamentally on an authoritarian system which
in its very nature places a premium on never
asking "Why?"
The problem is one of establishing a diffi
cult relationship between the necessary, prac
tical job of requiring something of Stanford
women, of making them people with a unique
and worthwhile orientation to just living and
'he converse necessity of making them also
ntelligent and self-critical.
Stanford's system of creating out of the
•reshman's desire to belong a self-perpetuating
oody of believers in the cult of Stanford wom
anhood seems of itself to defeat the latter aim
?f critical thinking and thereby to make impos

sible the former, that is a truly worthwhile orien
tation to living.
If, instead of telling Susy Q. Freshman what
Stanford women do and do not do, we told her
why Stanford women seem to think they should
do this and not that, and encouraged her to
think whether she herself believed in it, and if
not, why not, then perhaps—only perhaps, of
course—we would be shooting more in the di
rection of both aims.—Nancy Tilden.
This is the story of Susy Q. Freshman and
her "orientation" to Stanford life.
Susy Q. arrives at Roble or Branner or Ven
tura or wherever she arrives, with a funda
mental and overpowering desire to get along;
to fit in, to conform. In corridor meetings and
house meetings and in unofficial talks with her
sponsors she is told that "Stanford women do
this and Stanford women do not do this," and
because she wants so badly to belong she does
as Stanford women do and she tells others, per
haps those she herself sponsors some day, what
it is that Stanford women do and do not do.
You say this is a very good thing; this is the
way we make Stanford women something
unigue, something above the out - of - ordinary
women. But you are wrong; it is a very bad
thing.
It is a very bad thing because nobody ever
tells Susy Q. Freshman, and Susy Q. Freshman
seldom asks herself WHY she must do this and
why she must nof do that. In fact, one of the
fundamental but little recognized principles of
Stanford womanhood is that they accept what
is told them by the proper authorities without
question and indeed consider it their chief vir
tue to do so.
