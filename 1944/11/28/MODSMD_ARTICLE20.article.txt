High taxes? Sure are. Cost of living way up?
You know it. A lot of inconveniences? A hell
of a lot of them. You know all of these things of
course, but do you ever stop to think of the
reason they are brought about?
I know you will say: "'That fellow must be
really stupid. He should know the war causes
all of those things he mentioned." You are the
ones who are stupid, if you let your reasoning
stop at just the war. There are real reasons for
all the above things and they go much deeper
than a casual line of thought.
Take high taxes, for example. The govern
ment takes all your money to help finance this
tremendous conflict. The money is used to pay
for planes, tanks, ships, guns, and all the wea
pons which the American boys are using to
stamp out the deadly idea of suppression of
life and liberty. Not only for this, but the wea
pons you buy with taxes help to save our men
who have sacrificed much more than a few
lousy dollars.
The cost of living excessive; of course it is,
because all the workers are taking every advan
tage of the fighting man they can by holding
out for the highest wages possible, and then
competing with the government by buying
everything that our fighting men need, regard
less of the cost. It's a very good principle to
follow if you don't care about anyone but your
self.
Now about the inconveniences. Yes, I know
you can't drive to Carmel because of gas ra
tioning or you can't buy that pair of silk hose,
or you can't get a berth to Los Angeles on the
"Lark." But, have you ever slept in a foxhole
for six weeks? Have you ever had death star
ing you in the face for weeks on end? Have you
ever been really hungry? No, I don't think you
have had any of these things happen to you;
however, they are happening to your brother,
or father, or your best friend, and perhaps at
this very moment.
Have you ever seen a man with his leg shot
off by shrapnel? Or a person with half of his
head blown off, and although still living, you
can hear him grasping for that dear, precious
thing called life. Do you know what it is like
to be so crazed with fear that you want to run,
jump, scream, or even kill yourself to get away
from bombs, or gunshots, or anything remotely
concerned with the war? No, I don't imagine
any of you have even thought about such things
being connected with the war, as much as the
personal inconveniences the war has caused
you. I have seen adl of these and many more,
and they are not nice to remember.
Here at Stanford we are far away from the
war. We don't have to do the fighting, or work
ing in the war industries. As a matter of fact,
we really aren't asked to do much at all, except
gain some knowledge that will be a benefit to
ourselves in the long run.
What we are asked to do for the war effort
is to contribute all we can to the government,
so we can get this ugly, sordid war over as
guickly as possible. Through the Sixth War
Loan drive is the only way possible for us to
do it. The government is merely asking to bor
row your money so they can do their utmost
to save your brother, father, or friend from the
miseries I told you about.
If everyone of you doesn't contribute to this
loan with everything you can, you are traitors
to our country and to the boys who are ovet
there doing so much for you.
