Back from the Thanksgiving wars,
worn, tired, overfed and faint from
a stiff weekend of studies and stuff
the group settles down into the final
stretch of finals and the grind to
make up for the seven bygone study
less and beerful weeks.
For the lonely few who remained
on campus safe from whizzing bicy
cles and flying birdmen, Thanksgiv
ing consisted of turkey (a lot of it
neck), and the same old routineâ€”
the highways and byways of the
highway. The group was spread from
the sunny clime of Southern Califor
nia to the wintery plains of the north,
and extended even to the hills and
cabins of Los Altos.'
Comments ran from, "Gad. it's
good to be back here where I can
rest!" to "My mother and father
embraced me but then they kissed
me off."
First of the concert series, the Bal
let Russe, comes fro the Stanford
campus at Stanford men and women
take off one of their few culturals
of the year. Reviewed in the City,
the Ballet was a tremendous hit and
presents an excellent opportunity
for the Roughs to see an evening of
wonderful entertainment without
spending money for gas and tickets,
since most of the gals bought their
own.

No big game, but the Gaieties go
on forever, as the cast works day and
night to prepare an extravagaiixa.
the like of which has never before
been produced and probably never
will be again on this campus. The
little lads of the campus are thumb
ing through the well-worn and de
pleted check books for the old cab
bags to take the lights of their life
to the funshow of the year. Every
funny man on campus is in the show
except Dick Crane, and even Dick
might find a hole that he can enter
through and get into the act. Look
for a tremendous and unexpected
surprise which will make Gaieties
bigger and better and double and
probably triple the laughs. (
The story that five of the men ol
Monroe are leaving for the Merchant
Marine has set that hall afire and
bigger and better parties are being
prepared to help the lads on their
way. As soon as the "frivolous five"
are officially in, we will print their
names so the campus can join in the
iun.
