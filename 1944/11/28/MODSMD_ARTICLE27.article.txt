PARIS. Tuesday, Nov. 28 (U.R)—American troops broke into the powerful
German defense line along the River R6er Monday in hard won advances
of nearly three miles along the bloody road to Cologne and Swiss reports
said that U. S. paratroopers were swarming down behind the lower Sieg
fried line to facilitate an imminent French attack across the Rhine.
Lieut. Gen. William H. Simpson's Ninth Army drove through a maze of
trenches and entanglements to reach the Roer at two places below Juelich,
partly outflanking that stronghold 22 miles due west of Cologne, it was
disclosed at Supreme Allied Headquarters late last night.
The Ninth and the U. S. First Army on its right Hank were advancing
along a nightmarish 18-mile front against frenzied Nazi resistance and had
won possession of six outlying forts in the Roer defenses and northwest of
Aachen the First Army had deepened its wedge in the Reich to 15 miles.
More than 80,000 prisoners were disclosed to have been captured since
General Dwight D. Eisenhower's winter drive began gathering momentum
on November 8, including 31,000 taken by Lieut. Gen. Alexander M. Patch's
Seventh Army from the Vosges pocket.
