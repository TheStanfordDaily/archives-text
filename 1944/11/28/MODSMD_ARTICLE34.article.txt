# Students Discuss Research At Weekly Biology Seminars
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Organized about a decade ago, the weekly Biology Science Seminars are
utilized for passing on knowledge obtained through research and experi
mentation, said James P. Baumberger, professor of physiology.
"The present type of seminar was founded by Dr. C. B. Taylor as a method
of stimulating discussion and germinating ideas."

The speakers are chosen by a com
mittee headed by Professor Baum
berger. These speakers are chosen
when they have made an advance
ment of basic interest in their work.

'"After the speaker finishes," he
continued, "a discussion of the sub
ject is developed. Many of the con
tributions to this discussion are made
by teachers telling of their own work
in that particular field.
''We would be very happy to have
all interested students attend the
seminars. Although these meetings
demand more knowledge of biology,
the student would not only be able
to grasp the idea of how extensive
the knowledge of a branch of biology
is, but he could also learn some valu
able points about it.
''Students should take interest in
scientific progress, because a great
part of all this progress is gained
through research in universities."

Tomorrow's seminar speaker, Dr.
Sidney Raffel, associate professor of
bacteriology, will talk on the subject
of "Tuberculosis in Relation to the
Constitution of the Tubercle Bacil
lus." In this talk he will outline the
background of what is already
known in combating tuberculosis.
The purpose of this research in
T-B is to find a suitable vaccine for
the prevention of tuberculosis. The
tubercle is the bacteria causing the
disease, while the bacillus is the
germ. Together they form the tuber
culosis disease.
