# IS IT TOO LATE?

### 
Belatedly, perhaps, the Stanford Daily is pre
senting issues and problems pertinent to Stan
ford life; in most editorials from now to the end
of our publication-quarter, December 8, how
ever, Stanford students will be on the losing
side of the battle.
The real purpose of these editorials, which
began yesterday with an example of ineffi
ciency in student government, and a concur
rent lack of student interest in the Sixth War
Loan, is to show what has happened to Stan
ford students during the course of the war.
Perhaps we suffer from a home-front psycho
sis; perhaps we are still in our famed Ivory
Tower—peering out only occasionally at the
world—but, whatever it is, the Stanford student
of today does not have the something that is so
necessary to this University at this time.
Perhaps the weakness is in the number of
women, the age level, the potential of military
service—making the young Stanford man in
different to immediate campus problems-—or
the traditionally reactionary elements which ap
pear even in our student affairs.
For a long time now, many people have
sought to make us believe that Stanford today
is the same as the Stanford of yesterday. They
argued that we had descended from our Ivory
Tower; that we were at one with the world.
Well, they were right about Stanford today
being the same as Stanford of yesterday: we
are still in that Ivory Tower.
There are many causes, and the Daily exam
ination of these causes may come too late.
But, it continues again today, with an edi
torial by Managing Editor Nancy Tilden; it is
hereby recommended to all literate Stanford
women, especially freshmen.
