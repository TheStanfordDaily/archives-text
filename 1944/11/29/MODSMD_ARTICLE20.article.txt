# "I AM A LEADER"
## 
### 
Surely everyone at Stanford has heard about
"Leadership." We have leadership mdfetings
and leadership institutes and organizations of
outstanding leaders. We even teach leadership.
Susy Q. and Johnny Freshman quickly learn
that the chief aim of their life here at Stanford
is "to be a leader" or, as they would put it, a
BMOC.
It goes something like this: They want to be
able to say "I am a leader" and yet, strangely
enough, they do not want to lead anyone any
where.
In other words, there is at Stanford as there
is in much of the rest of America, a fervent
yearning "to be" somebody and very little de
side "to do" anything.
Here, though very few of us recognize it
fully, is the real root of what we call Stanford's
ivory tower attitude, a general apathy, to doing
anything which is not going to get you some
where.
Now, rolling bandages or buying war bonds
Dr attending house meetings never made any
one a "leader." And so War Board screams at
us "Please come roll bandages, please come

buy bonds, please attend your house meetings,"
but they scream in vain because, unlike being
president of your house, or chairman of the
bond selling committee or indeed chairman of
War Board, there is no leadership in it.
But, you will answer if you're honest, I have
so little time, I can't afford to spend it where it's
not going to do me any good. And here is the
crux of the matter. It revolves on the question
of what is "any good" to me.
According to our prevalent leadership theory
evidently "being" somebody is the only thing
that's any good for me. This is its fallacy. If
you should ask any honest, self-critical leader
he will tell that what was of good, of satisfaction
to him in his position was not "being" ASSU
president or chairman of stamp sales, but the
work — the every-day-ordinary sweat kind of
work—they did as ASSU president or chairman
of stamp sales.
All of this has been better said by a woman
whose daughter was going to Stanford, in a
letter written to the YWCA on their leadership
program. In approximate form these were her
words:
"What is this leadership you speak of? In
my experience there are no leaders. There are
only people doing different jobs."
—Nancy Tilden.
