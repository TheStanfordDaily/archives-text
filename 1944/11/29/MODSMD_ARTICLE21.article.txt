# Bull Session
## 
### Dick Crane 
Here we go again, folksâ€”the biggest show
of the year. The only event of the campus that
is faintly reminiscent of the 'Big Game." Laughs,
music, gi-r-r-l-s, and in general, a very enjoy
able evening.
Yes, it's the annual Gaieties, sponsored by
the Rams' Head organization. This is an ex
travaganza which reminds one of the days of
Flo Ziegfeld. Who knows? Out of this show
might emerge an Abbott or Costello, a Jo Staf
ford, a Fred Astaire; and just think, you can
say "I knew them when . .
Last year the theme of the show was strictly
G.I., but this year, due to a depletion of military
personnel, I guess the theme will be strictly
civilian, which could be most anything. I
haven't seen any of the acts, but I did see some
of the tryouts, and there is a "boogie" piano
duet that can't miss. This, among other acts,
will go a long way toward making this show
the best "Gaieties" ever given.
All the students who are participating in the
show have worked a lot of long, hard hours
for your enjoyment, and the compensation for
their toil is a mass attendance to the two per
formances of the Gaieties, which will be given
on Friday and Saturday of this week.
To change to another subject, students or
other people who have a definite interest in
campus life are always approaching me and
giving me ideas for a Bull Session. A lot of
them are crackpots, but once in a while you do
get one that is good, but that you can't print. I
will tell you about one that I can't put in my
column.
A student approached this morning with an
idea of ridiculing the way women of Stanford
dress when they are attending classes, but of
course I can't talk about that. He said that Stan
ford women are noted for being "sloppy," but
I can't print that because he was very ambigu
ous in his use of the word "sloppy."
He said that women of Stanford used to wear
old clothes to class, but lately have started to
wearing "date" dresses, fur coats, and above all,
multi-colored hose, which reminds one of the
days of the Police Gazette. He said such out
landish costumes are undoubtedly derivatives
of an inferiority compleV and wearing such
stuff is a wonderful way to attract attention.
Of course his observations are undoubtedly
correct, but I wouldn't want to print such things,
because some people are so sensitive, and I
might hurt somebody's feelings. I hope all of
you readers understand by now why a lot of
things don't appea: in the Daily, although they
no doubt should.
