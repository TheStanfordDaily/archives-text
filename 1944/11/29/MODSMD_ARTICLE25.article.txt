# After the War's Over---What?

### LISA EBBERTS 
Editor's Note: This is the sixth
in a series of articles on the post
war world.

We asked Dr. Graham Stuart two
vital questions which we felt he
was particularly qualified to answer.
(1) What will be the probable inter
national organization of the future?
(2) Will it be successful? Dr. Stuart
is a widely recognized authority on
international relations, who worked
in Geneva for several years in close
contact with the League of Nations.
Recently he returned from more than
a year in Washington with the State
Department.
"To answer these specific queries,"
lie said, "one should be a prophet
I rather than a professor. Neverthe
| less ,it should he possible at the
present time to give a fairly close
approximation of the form of organi
zation which will eventually be
adopted. As to its success, if it
doesn't succeed, there may be no
posterity to worry about it.
"In discussing this new associa
tion of nations for the preservation
of peace, whose fundamental features
have been laid down by the four
principal powers of the United Na
tions at the recent Conference at
Dumbarton Oaks, it is both useful
and interesting to draw certain con
clusions from a comparison with the
League of Nations.
Not a Makeshift
"In the first place, the Dumbarton
Oaks' tentative formula was not pro
j duced from a hastily written draft at
| the urgent insistence of the head of a
I state, such as the draft prepared for
| President Wilson in two days' time
| by Colonel House; nor was it the
I production of a group of publicists
I outside of the government, as was the
i British Phillimore plan; noi* was it a
harsh set of proposals by a govern
ment commission, such as the French
plan of M. Bourjeois.
"The work of the American dele
gation at Dumbarton Oaks was the
culmination of three and one-half
years of research and discussion by
scores of experts in the Department
of State who had the assistance of
ranking officers in the Army and
Navy, interested members of the
Congress, distinguished authorities in
international law and eminent citi
zens in all walks of life.
Great Preparation
"The Dumbarton Oaks Conference
was based directly upon the Four
I Nation Declaration signed at Mos

cow, Oct. 30, 1943, wherein the
United States, the United Kingdom,
the U.S.R.R., and China, recognized
the need 'of establishing at the ear
liest practicable date a general inter
national organization . . . open to all
. . . for the maintenance of peace
"Even with all the advance prep
j arations the Conference itself worked
J seven weeks on the tentative propos-
I als which had previously been ex-
J changed by the British, Soviet and
1 American governments. Since the
| Soviet is still neutral in the Pacific
War, separate discussions had to be
; arranged with' the Chinese govern
ment.
"In the Proposals for the Es.ablish
ment of a General International Or
-1 ganization upon which agreement
j was reached by the four powers at
I the Dumbarton Oaks Conference we
j find a striking similarity to the
League of Nations organization. Both
open with a" preliminary statement
of similar purposes and principles.
I The new organization, like the old,
j possesses an Assembly, a Council,
I an international court of justice, and
| a secretariat. The Assembly resem
j b'.es the League Assembly in many
respects, although it is given less au-
I ihority.
Powerful Security Force
"The Security Council of tin new
j organization is far more powerful
than the League Council since it
I not only advises on the means of
j maintaining peace, but it may impose
I sanctions both economic and military.
| A military Staff Committee advises
| and assists the Security Council in
regard to military requirements.
Armed forces and air force contin
gents are to be available immediately
for international enforcement'action.
Economic and Social Council
"The new organization has a more
: coordinated agency for economic and
social organization than did the
League of Nations. The Economic
and Social Council as proposed at
Dumbarton Oaks may have a coordi
nating power over all international
economic, social and humanitarian
| activities within its jurisdiction,
I whereas the League set up various

commissions of this sort which were
separate and distinct.
"The new secretariat may well be
organized in very much the same
form as the League Secretariat, and
the international court may be the
identical Court of International Jus
tice hitherto functioning at the
Hague in accordance wilh the statute
under the League. No mention was
made in the Dumbarton Oaks pro
posals of the International Labor Of-
Jice, but that organization has
worked so well that it is well able to
continue functioning on its own,
"The great advantages of the new
organization over the League are:
First, its provisions for immediate
membership by all peace loving
states; second, that while thus pro
| viding for universality it recognizes
the advantages of regional arrange
! ments or agencies, and ,third, that it
! is given adequate sanctions which
are immediately available,
l oo Indexible
One of its greatest weaknesses is
that it makes no provision for peace
i tul change, that is for revision of un
! satisfactory or obsolete treaties by
the international organization. An
! other weakness may be the voting
procedure in the Security Council,
which has not been worked out in
a fashion which is satisfactory to the
four consulting powers.
"The fundamental features of the
! new world organization will un
| doubtedly be those proposed at
Dumbarton Oaks. The details will be
those proposed at Dumbarton Oaks.
The details will be worked out sub
| sequently. The absolute necessity of
I making this organization work is
j recognized by the four powers in a
position to make ii effective. The
> peoples of those states arc over
! whelmingly for it. If this will be
maintained by these governments
j and their peoples, its success seems
assured.

We asked Dr. Graham Stuart two
vital questions which we felt he
was particularly qualified to answer.
(1) What will be the probable inter
national organization of the future?
(2) Will it be successful? Dr. Stuart
is a widely recognized authority on
international relations, who worked
in Geneva for several years in close
contact with the League of Nations.
Recently he returned from more than
a year in Washington with the State
Department.
"To answer these specific queries,"
