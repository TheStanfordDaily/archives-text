# Correspondent Gives Lecture
## 
### 
Elmer W. Peterson, who. during
the past 12 years has served as a
foreign correspondent in 30 coun
tries, discussed "Outlaw Europe: A
Problem for the Future" on the
Tuesday Evening Series program in
Memorial Hall last night.
Mr. Peterson spoke effectively and
illustrated his points with interest
ing incidents taken from his experi
ences as a correspondent.
In fighting the first World War,
said Mr. Peterson, the United States
performed a good operation, but after
the operation was over we went off
and left the patient to die. We must
not let this happen again.
When this war is over, peace will
not descend over Europe "like a soft,
white mist." Instead we shall have
continuing problems, difficult prob
lems to cope with.
Among the most difficult of these
problems are those of the German
people, and what to do with them.
We must have a harsh peace for Ger
many, but it must be one which can
be enforced 15 or 20 years from now
after we have cooled off emotionally.
Mr. Peterson also discussed the
problems which will arise in connec
tion with the people of Japan and of
Nazi-occupied countries.
