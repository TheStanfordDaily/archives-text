# Toyon Announces Plans for Dance
## 
### 
Inviting the whole campus to Toy
on's "After-the-Gaieties" dance on
Saturday from 9 to 1, John Murray,
dance chairman, last night predicted
that it would be one of the top in
formal affairs of the quarter.
As Toyon freshmen again play host
to the campus, the dance promises to
provide supreme recorded music, re
freshments to be supplied by Cap
and Gown and decorations featuring
the Gaieties theme.
Patrons and patronesses for the
dance are: Miss Mary Jane Donald
son, Mrs. Betty Lee Schatz, Miss
Rosamond Clarke, Dr. Harold Maile
Bacon and Dean and Mrs. Bunn.
Quad photographers will be on
hand to record the event. Russel
Quackenbush, music director for the
evening, guarantees plenty of
"smooth and sweet platters for easy
dancing."
Other committee members include
Coyt Hackett, Ed Uundquist, Nick
Margaros, Bill Aikman, and chair
man Murray.
Although the dance will begin at
9, many dancers will be expected
after the Gaieties performance earli
er in the evening.
