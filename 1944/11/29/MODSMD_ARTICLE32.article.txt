Well, it looks as if all you football
fans might just as well cross off an
other iootball season on your calen
dars. Although there arc still some
mighty important games left to be
played, the season is in the main
over, with bowl bids already made
and accepted. The Stanford Daily's
staff of pigskin pickers, for one, is
only too glad to kiss goodbye to an
other autumn of humiliation and
disgrace.
It is true that the experts will drop
in from time to time to offer tips on
such games as the Army-Navy and
Texas-Texas A & M games next
week, and the Fourth Air Force-
Randolph Field tilt on December 10,
but the main part of the blood, sweat
and tears is over. We will also be
back, of course, in the final edition
to offer complete dope on the various
bowl games played January 1.
The Wind-up
Semi-final season averages ran as
lollows: Mort Cohen is still tops,
| having called in all a total of G7
I right out of 85, for a mark of .788;
| your humble correspondent, "Bilge"
| Adams, is second with 79 out of 105,
to top the regulars who have predict
| ed every week, with a .752 average;
| Jimmy Weinberg, with 77 out of 105,
! and Gordon Levy with 6G out of 90,
I are tied for third at .733, and "Blar-
I ney" Gugel's reputation is ruined, as
he is still last with 73 out of 105, for
a .395 average.
Score for the 15 games predicted
this last weekend runs something
like this: Adams, 14; Cohen, 12; Gu
gel. 12; Weinberg, 11 and Levy 0 (de
fault).

disgrace.
It is true that the experts will drop
in from time to time to offer tips on
such games as the Army-Navy and
Texas-Texas A & M games next
week, and the Fourth Air Force-
Randolph Field tilt on December 10,
but the main part of the blood, sweat
and tears is over. We will also be
back, of course, in the final edition
to offer complete dope on the various
bowl games played January 1.
The Wind-up
Semi-final season averages ran as
lollows: Mort Cohen is still tops,
| having called in all a total of G7
I right out of 85, for a mark of .788;
| your humble correspondent, "Bilge"
| Adams, is second with 79 out of 105,
to top the regulars who have predict
| ed every week, with a .752 average;
| Jimmy Weinberg, with 77 out of 105,
! and Gordon Levy with 6G out of 90,
I are tied for third at .733, and "Blar-
I ney" Gugel's reputation is ruined, as
he is still last with 73 out of 105, for
a .395 average.
Score for the 15 games predicted
this last weekend runs something
like this: Adams, 14; Cohen, 12; Gu
gel. 12; Weinberg, 11 and Levy 0 (de
fault).
Scores
Here's how the scores for the
week's games stack up:
USC 40. UCLA 13. Weinberg's
Bruins let him down.
St. Marys PF 33, Cal 6. No doubt
in anyone's mind.
SMU 7. Texas Tech 6. Big upset,
but Gugel got it.
TCU 9. Rice 6. Everyone was right.
Oklahoma A & M 28. Oklahoma 6.
Tulsa beat Arkansas and Gugel,
but we forgot the score.
Minnesota 28. Wisconsin 20. Big
Ten cellar championship.
Illinois 25, Northwestern 6.
Buckeyes Win
Ohio State 18. Michigan 14. The
best game we've heard all year, as
we said it would be.
Indiana 14, Purdue 6. Adams and
Gugel cheering the Hoosiers.
Penn 20. Cornell 0. Gugel musta
been nutz to pick the Big Red.
Dartmouth 18. Columbia 0. Gugel
misfired again.
Yale 6. Virginia (!. It's Christmas
season, so everybody gets a win for
this one.
Notre Dame 21, Georgia Tech 0.
How smart I am.
Well, it looks as if all you football
fans might just as well cross off an
other iootball season on your calen
dars. Although there arc still some
mighty important games left to be
played, the season is in the main
over, with bowl bids already made
and accepted. The Stanford Daily's
staff of pigskin pickers, for one, is
only too glad to kiss goodbye to an
other autumn of humiliation and
disgrace.
