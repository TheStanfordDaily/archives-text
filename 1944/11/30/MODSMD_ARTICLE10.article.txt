# Post-Gaieties Hop at Toyon
## 
### 
"It's the only thing to do after the
Gaieties on Saturday night," claims
John Murray, Toyon freshman. "I
mean that we're expecting the whole
campus—at least most of it —to meet
in Toyon's beautiful lounge for some
swell dancing from 9 to 1 to the top
bands in the land."
Murray, who heads the Toyon
Freshmen Club's dance committee,
guarantees "dee-licious" refresh
ments, thanks to Cap and Gown,
the women's honorary group on
campus. "Even if you attend the
Saturday night Gaieties there will
he plenty of time left for dancing,"
remarked Murray.
Decorations by Coyt Hackett, Ed
Lundquist and Nick Margaros will
follow the Gaieties theme, while
Quad cameramen will be on the spot
to snap pictures of the affair.
Patrons and patronesses invited
| are: Miss Mary Jane Donaldson,
Miss Rosamond Clarke, Mrs. Betty
j Lee Schatz, Dean and Mrs. John
Bunn, and Dr. Harold M. Bacon.
