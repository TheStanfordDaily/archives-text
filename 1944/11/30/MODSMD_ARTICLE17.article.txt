# WHAT ABOUT THIS STANFORD SPIRIT?
## 
### 
The key to student spirit is student government, and the key
to student government is representation; our student govern
ment is not representative. It is not inclusive enough, it does not
draw members from every section of the student body; it has
come to rely on people who have received publicity—and suffer
from the psychosis of the committee mind—for its membership.
Once elected to the Executive Committee —and by virtue of
a name—these people stagnate with self-satisfaction, self-right
eousness, and "leadership." Their stagnation seeps down
through the body of student affairs, to create apathy, indiffer
ence, and to wreck student spirit.
Our student government structure is faulty and should be re
organized so that the phoenix of Stanford spirit, Stanford student
democracy, can rise out of the ashes of the present system.
The members of Executive Committee should be elected from
living groups, by the living group. From those elected, candi
dates for student body president and vice-president could be
presented to the student body in a general election. Ideally, the
small living groups could have one representative per house, the
larger groups more on the basis of the number of residents. If
student government were sincere, the best men and women
from the living groups would be elected.
The number elected would not make an unwieldy Ex com.
The people elected would make up an Ex Com with vitality,
force, and purpose. It would be an Ex Com with enough compe
tition within itself to avoid the usual spectacle of current Ex Com
meetings: babes in slumberland.
Student government is now operating half under a constitu
tion, half without one; it is rumored that a new constitution is
being written, to be presented for ratification next guarter.
If that constitution is merely a re-hash of the document that
has permitted student government to slip into inadeguate hands,
then it is our serious hope that responsible student voters will
leject it.
