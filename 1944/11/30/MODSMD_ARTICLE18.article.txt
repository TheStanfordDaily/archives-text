Sponsors for next quarter have been chosen in a series of
interviews which ended yesterday. Sponsoring is one of those
things which strongly touch upon the things we have discussed
in the Daily the last few days concerning Stanford women and
Slanford leadership.
With the extraordinary difficulties of wartime strain and ex
ceptional curricula adjustments, it is important that the people
chosen for sponsors be not only willing but determined to do
an exceptional and, we hope, somewhat different-than-the-ordi
nary job.
We hope that this will mean a job calculated to encourage
each student to make his own particular and individual contri
bution to Stanford and avoid what has come to be particular
self-perpetuating snobbish conceptions of a typically dressed,
typically mannered, typically voiced, typically phrased, and—
worst of all—typically thinking automaton erroneously thought
f.o be "in" as the "Stanford woman."
In an age when self-criticism and independent thought is be
ing heralded as a "way of life" (for it is "thought" and not cigar
ettes and nylons that men are dying for), it is too obvious that
in our "ivory tower" we place great value on a superficial and
'lypocritical mould of character incapable of dealing with adult
oroblem's.
You people who are to convey to younger women the spirit
it Stanford traditions and duties must emphasize that the pur
cose of their classes—Western Civ, Biology, English 2a —is to
■sharpen theii critical faculties and independent thought, and
hese are to be put into use now while they are in school and
especially upon themselves now while they are deciding what
role to play in a world where no one can afford to sit on the
■sidelines, now or ever.- Giannini
