There are certain organizations on the Stanford campus that
have a job of promoting ideas, arousing spirit, and, in general,
getting the student body acguainted with events that take place
at Stanford.
Two of these groups are the War Board and Cardinals. It is
their job definitely to see that shameful things don't occur here
in regard to such happenings as Monday's sales in the Sixth War
Loan. It is partially the fault of these boards for not creating
enough interest in the drive. I don't know what is the matter with
the organization responsible, be it the War Board or Cardinals,
but I do know that they are not putting their best efforts into their
job, or responsibility to Stanford.
For the most part, you students of Stanford are responsible
for Monday's exhibition. I, along with thousands of servicemen
and ex-servicemen of Stanford, have nothing but the deepest dis
gust and contempt for the conditions that are prevailing here in
legard to aiding the war effort. There are many Stanford men and
women now in the service of our country, and I will bet money
that if they knew of our casual passing over of this war loan drive
they would not care to have anyone know they had ever been
connected with this University.
•I suppose I could make a lot of excuses for all of you by say
ing, "I guess there is too much interest in the Gaieties," or
"Christmas is coming and I don't have the money." Oh, yes,
there are a hell of a lot of ways to get out of buying bonds, and
from the looks of things, you are just the people who can do it.
I don't particularly relish writing this sort of thing for my
column, but all you people are going to get nothing but "bond
buying" until conditions improve in regard to the Sixth War
Loan. I'm not certain there is any love of country or gratitude
for our fighting men in any of you, but by God! I'm going to do
my best to try to bring out some of the dormant, hidden thing
called "patriotism."
