To the Editor of the Stanford Daily:
Sir:
There was an article in the Daily
not long ago inquiring about the at
titude of war veterans on the ques
tion of the state of California allow
ing American citizens of Japanese
ancestry to return to their homes
within the state, providing military
authorities see no war hazard there
in. I am not a war veteran. I am a
naval officer, and this is what I think
about it:
Because of the barbaric and
shamefully cruel conduct of Japa
nese military forces, I must confess
a present antipathy toward every
thing connected with Japan and the
Japanese people. But if this anti-
Japanese feeling of mine be strong,
my belief in the Constitution of my
country and in its just and fair ad
ministration is considerably strong
er. I think they should be permitted
to return to California for this rea
son: Article XIV of the United
States Constitution states in simple
language (1) that all persons born
in the United States are citizens of
the United States and of the state
wherein they reside; (2) that no
state shall make or enforce any law
which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of the citizens of the
United States; (3) nor shall any state
deprive any person of life, liberty
or property without due process of
law; (4) nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal pro
tection of the laws.
I cannot shrug off the words of the
Constitution as mere legal techni
calities, as others seem to be doing.
This Japanese question involves the
essence of our American way of life,
and as a precedent could menace
our own personal freedom. If our
Constitution cannot protect a mi
nority group of American citizens
from arbitrary and capricious action,
and guarantee to them basic rights
of liberty at the very time when
these rights are jeopardized, then
our Constitution is impotent under
stress and can be laughed off as a
hypocrisy. If any of these citizens
of Japanese ancestry are guilty of
treason or subversive activities they
can be punished severely under or
derly processes of law. But whore
the guilt of any person lies un
proven, and they are denied liberty
of access to California because of
Japanese ancestry alone, then how
under this Constitution can unv of

us ever again be sure of the guaran-
