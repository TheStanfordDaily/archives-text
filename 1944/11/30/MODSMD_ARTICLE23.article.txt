# OUR HASHER

The earnest desire for, and the
willingness to support, athletics by
the Stanford student body needs no
better demonstration than the turn
out of approximately 800 students at
a game between Cal and U.S.C.,
schools for which the Stanford stu
dents have never had the tremen
dous hots.
Numerous reasons have been
presented by the school authori
ties and the hoard of trustees for
the non-resumption of intercol
legiate athletics, among them the
fact that there was no place for
athletics on the campus in war
time, the lack of material, the ex
pense, the difficulty of transporta
tion, and (he changing conditions
of the war effort.
It is the policy of the University
to return to athletics when it was
felt that the school was ready to
resume competition on a basis that
would be beneficial to the students
and the Farm itself.
According to a tentative poll
taken on the campus, this column
ist feels that now is the time for
the resumption of intercollegiate
athletics to the extent (hat Stan
ford field a basketball team for
the coming season, a team which
will provide benefits to the student
body and the players: which could
he fielded with a minimum of ex
pense, and which could give the
Farm a start back into athletics,
a step more practical than an
abrupt jump back into all sports.
O'ur argument .against the first
objection, that there is no place on
the campus for athletics during war
time, is the fact that many of the
schools on the Pacific coast have
resumed basketball. Among the
schools which have resumed play
are Oregon, Oregon State, Santa
Clara, and St. Mary's, as well as
many schools of the Big Ten and
the East.
Now it would probably be pre
sumptuous for us to advocate the
return of basketball if no one else
was doing it, but when schools of
known reputation and excellent
scholastic standing, without (he
benefit of Navy help, have re
sumed basketball; why then could
Stanford not field a team?
The question of expense is the
next that arises. The idea that the
Board of Athletic Control would
have to resume its function and that
many expenses would be incurred
from its operation is a fallacy.
The men who could play are so
anxious to play (hat (hey would
be willing to pay for their own
uniforms, (heir (raveling ex
penses and any minor expenses
that would occur; (bis would be
more than amply covered by the
support of the student body. Any
aid from (he Board would be of a
nature (hat would require a mini
mum of support and work in
volved.
The question of material can be
disregarded to a large extent, for
out of a student body of several
hundred can certainly be found the
requisites for a good squad. Santa
Clara and St. Mary's are doing it
with less men than we have. As a
tentative squad Dave Brown, Jack
Heald, Morely Thompson, Dick Mar
quette, and Jim Bradshaw could
field an aggregation that would do
credit to the school.
Transportation could be over
come by confining competition to
the bay area and (he peninsula.
Playing Santa Clara. San Jose. Cal.
and St. Mary's as well as service
teams would confine (he transpor
tation (o a minor problem. The

question of service teams brings
up the aid and recreation that
could he provided to service men
who would see the games.
Now that the problem has been
presented, there will be follow-ups
and we want to know the opinion
of the students in a concrete form,
so that the Board of Trustees will
realize the feasability of the plan and
the desire of the student body for
the squad, and take cognizance of
the idea that now is the time for
action.
This column was not written in
the old rah-rah spirit hut was in
troduced as a plea for our re
sumption of basketball, for we can
see that there is a need for ath
letics here on the campus. The
expenses would he minor; we have
the material; transportation could
he overcome by confining the
playing to a limited area. So let's
have a team.
