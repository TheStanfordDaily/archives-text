# Cardinals Ask For One Man
## 
### 
Cardinals activities committee of
the campus will hold tryouts Monday
and Tuesday from 3 to 5 p.m. in the
Excom Room to fill the man's posi
tion being vacated at the end of the
quarter by newly appointed student
manager Jim Emerson.
All men of sophomore or upper
division standing are urged to try
out, for although only one position is
open, Cardinals wants all men who
have a real interest in Farm activi
ties and the time for active partici
pation, to notify them of it.
Cardinals conduct activities on an
all-campus scaleâ€”rallies, drives and
dances; their aim is to maintain the
Stanford "school spirit."
