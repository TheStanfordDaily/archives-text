# Arguello, Co. C Lead Murals In Swan Song
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Company "C" and Arguello A.A.
hold the likes of a royal flush, the
mittful of cards which seldom turns
up in poker, in today's final round
of mural football in both leagues—
weather permitting, of course. Nei
ther can lose the titles which they
cinched on Tuesday, putting both
teams in a soft spot.
Undisputed titleholders in League
I, Company "C" meets the powerful
Nu Sigma Nu's (Med. III). It will
be a moral victory for the Dave
Brown and Jackie Heald gang if
they can penetrate the soldier's de
fense. something which hasn't been
done too often this season. All that
an anti-climax Med. victory can pro
duce is some lost prestige for the
unbeaten team which is prepping for
their play-off game.
Buchanan Against Med. I
A fighting Buchanan Bearcat out
fit will attempt to wind up the season
with a win over Alpha Kappa Kappa.
The Bearcats will be favored with
their speedy attack.
Toyon's Operators and Sequoia
will meet in a game that may pro
duce Toyon's first victory of the
season. Encina's Flyers will take a
fling against Arthur in the other
scheduled league fracas.
Arguello vs. Gerona
High-riding Arguello A.A., undis
puted winners in League 11, will
lead the field in the season's swan
sojng against twice-beaten Gerona
A<C. The speedy champs will be up
against a real test in the vaunted
Gerona passing attack.
Med. School tackles the Dee Gee
Hashers in a real closie and Fire
house meets Washington in the only
other league contests.
Play-off Next Week
Coach Elwyn Bugge, head of mural
sports, has tentatively scheduled the
play-off game between Arguello and
Company "C" for next Thursday
afternoon. Final date will depend
on: the dubious weather situation,
however.
Games postponed for reasons other
than rain will be played next Tues
day, Bugge said. .

weather permitting, of course. Nei
ther can lose the titles which they
cinched on Tuesday, putting both
teams in a soft spot.
Undisputed titleholders in League

Nu Sigma Nu's (Med. III). It will
be a moral victory for the Dave
Brown and Jackie Heald gang if
they can penetrate the soldier's de

an anti-climax Med. victory can pro
duce is some lost prestige for the
unbeaten team which is prepping for
their play-off game.

puted winners in League 11, will
