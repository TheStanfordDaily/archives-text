# Hachten on Stern All-America Team
## 
### 
Stanford may not have a football
team, but its men are still ably rep
resented on the gridiron, at least
that's what Bill Stern, ace news
caster of NBC, thinks or he would
not have put Bill Hachten on his
first string all - American team.
Hachten joined the Marine program
and left Stanford a few years ago.
Last year he starred for Cal, and this
year played only half the season, but
was one of the outstanding linemen
of the year. While he played for Cal
the Bears beat UCLA and tied USC.
When he, Dick Madigan, another
Stanford boy and a few others left,
Cal lost every other game.
Said Stern: "Bill Hachten was a
60-minute player and rated as one
of the greatest linemen the Coast has
ever known." Stern's first string
follows:
L.E.—Paul Walker, Yale
L.T.—William Willis, Ohio State
L.G.—William Hachten, California
C. —John Tavener, Indiana
R.G.—Ellis Jones, Tulsa
R.T.—Don Whitmire, Navy
R.E.—Philip Tinsley, Georgia Tech
Back —Claude Young, Illinois
Back—Earl Girard, Wisconsin
Back—Leslie Horvath, Ohio State
Back—Felix Blanchard, Army
