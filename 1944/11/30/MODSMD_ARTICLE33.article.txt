We dropped in at the L. A. Coli
seum last Saturday and witnessed an
afternoon of good, clean fun in which
USC's "prewar" Trojans massacred
Cousin Joe Bruin of UCLA to the
tune of 40-13.
After watching them in their last
two games, we're convinced that the
'44 Trojans are the best outfit that's
hit the Coast since Stanford's Big
Red Machine ran out of gas. The
precision of Troy's Model T was rem
iniscent of the good old days of Al
bert, Kmetovic, Gallerneau, and
Standlee.
Most of the credit is due to Jim
Hardy's perfect quarterbacking and
the fine play of the Trojan line. The
Southern Cal line so successfully
outcharged the Bruins that even the

second-string halfbacks were able to
get through for long gains, 5 and 10
yards at a crack.
The Bruins resorted to a five-man
line in the hope of stopping the SC
aerial attack, with the result that the
Trojans went through them with
greater ease on the ground, gaining
over 300 yards from scrimmage to
30-some-odd for the Uclans.
Laugh of the day came when the
Bruins finally scored (when 40 points
behind) after only 57 minutes of
play. The Trojan rooting section rose
to a man and cheered, then yelled
"Make that kick!" After the kick was
made, the SC rooters counted out the
Bruins' points one by one (all seven
of them).
USC was even more impressive
against UCLA than they were in

trouncing Cal the week before. C;il
admittedly didn't have a team, but
the Bruins throught they had one
(and so did one or two chagrined
LA sports writers). We confess that
we too were among those fooled, but
we've seen the light now, and pre
dict an easy victory for the Trojans
over Tennessee in Pasadena (good
old Pasadena) January 1.
