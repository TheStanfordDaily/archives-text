placed at various places on campus.
Representatives Meet Today
The co-chairmen announced that
all representatives will meet in the
Nitery at 4:30 today to discuss plans
for the collection.

Sponsored by Women's Conference,
the campaign was the idea of
students who felt that students
should have a more direct contact
with servicemen and suggested that
records, albums and books would be
appreciated by men in hospitals in
the Bay area. A slogan of 'What
we like best, they want most," gives
meaning to the co-chairmen's re
quest that only new or gifts in good
condition be donated in the place of
cast-offs and unwanted "white ele
phants."
Miss Van Dyke's telephone number
