# Mothers' Club Hear Alumnae
## 
### 
A college education is a valuable
| asset to a business career, was the
| opinion of Peggy Boothe, fifst speak
er at the Stanford Mother's Club last
Tuesday. "Not only does the college
education equip one to meet respon
sibilities more easily, but it also
teaches the students to work with
each other."
Sally Heitman, acting director of
the Stanford School of Nursing,
spoke of the urgent need for more
I nurses at present and in the future,
| when there will be a vast future for
| civilian nursing.
Miss Heitman said that although
| nursing may not be glamorous, it
| certainly does not amount to the'
scrubbing of floors. Since the nurse
works with people, she learns to be
tolerant and self-disciplined.
Helen Herring, who accompanied
Miss Heitman, stressed the value of
a scientific course of at least two
years at the School of Nursing
