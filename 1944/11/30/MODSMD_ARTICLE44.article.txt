# Skiers Exercise For Holiday Trip
## 
### 
Remember the old "Bend ze knees',
days of dry skiing hours spent under
the oaks near the women's tennis
courts?
Well, it seems that several stu
dents are going skiing over the
Christmas holidays and Miss Luell
Weed has offered to give limber
ing-up exercises to men and wom
en interested.
The exercise class, which will meet
on each Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday for the next three weeks,
begins tomorrow at 5 p.m. near the
tennis courts.
Students should wear gym suits,
slacks, jeans, or ski boots if they
wish. In case of rain, the class
will meet indoors.
Students who are interested in
holiday skiing will meet in Room
100 on Wednesday from 7 p.m. to 8
p.m. to discuss plans.
At this meeting a ski movie will
be shown, according to Charlotte
Townsend, in charge of the group.
