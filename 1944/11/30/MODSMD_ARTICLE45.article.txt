THE LEANING TOWER AND OTH
ER STORIES, By Katherine Anne
Porter (Harcourt, Brace and Com
pany, $2.50.)
The Leaning Tower and Other
Stories, by Katherine Anne Porter,
now on sale at the Bookstore, are
confirmation of the already strong
public opinion that Miss Porter
writes some of the best prose of our
time.
This last book is small but com
plete, as are the stories in it. It is a
book which can be read through at
one time; for Miss Porter, although
she writes about the same place and
the same people for two-thirds of
the book, is never monotonous. As
her characters reappear, they become
familiar rather than boring, and the
! place they live in it described to the
[ reader as a place where he has been,
| not just seen.
Spotlight on the South
Six of the stories are set in the
[ South and are concerned with one
group of people: Grandmother and
Nannie, the two old women who hold
the family together; Uncle Jimbilly,
who carves little tombstones out of
wood for the graves of various small
I animals, and the two children, Mi
randa and her brother, Paul.
These last two are the main figures
| of one of the best stories in the book.
"The Grave," which is a tiny but
I vividly accurate picture of a child's
j awe at life and death.
Flexibility and Range
The three other stories in the book
show Miss Porter's range and flexi
bility in subject matter; one is a per
j ceptive account of a small boy's un-
J happiness; another, an equally sym
j pathetic but very humorous tale of
! a certain Mr. Halloran's downfall;
j and the last, the title story, a terri
fying study of Berlin, seen from a
; young American's point of view.
Miss Porter's style, throughout the
book, is notable for its simplicity and
precision; it is in her stories of child
hood, however, that she is unex
celled. She is able to communicate
a child's thoughts with clarity and
with no touch of patronage, which is
a difficult thing for an adult to do.
