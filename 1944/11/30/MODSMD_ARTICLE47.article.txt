# Quad Records 50 Years Of Unique 'Farm' Life
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
From 1894 to 1944 the history of the Stanford family is recorded in the
pages of Quad —"a happy remembrance of the peculiar and unique inci
dents of years at Stanford," the first editor, A. Lewis, Jr., called Quad.
Thumbing through the old and new volumes, a set of which is in the
Hopkins room of the main Library, is like watching Stanford grow. Quad

is a reflection ol the University year
by year, and each edition is a treas
ure of remembrance for Farm men
and women as they 'are graduated.
Pioneers! O, Pioneers
Volume I of Quad was published
in 1894 by the junior class, the first
class to complete four years on the
Farm. They took the name of "Pio
neer" and the vigorous yell: "Zah!
Zah! Zeer! We're right here! '95!
'95 Pioneer!" There were few pho
tographs—only the Founders' son,
Leland Stanford, Jr., the mandolin
and glee clubs, the Quad staff, sev
eral athletes, and Pvlrs. Stanford and
Timothy Hopkins rated pictures.
Names and statistics made copy but
prize poetry and stories occupied
most of the book.
The comic section "Grinds" kidded
faculty and sutdents alike with car
toons, quotations and the inevitable
poems.
Originality Typical of Quad
The arrangement of Quad in sep
arate sections — administration,
classes, activities, athletics, and hu
mor— has been followed more or
less, but each annual has been as
original as its editor could make it
and still conform to tradition.
The earthquake was the opening
feature of the 1908 edition. Pictures
show the destruction of most of the
campus buildings and the spirit in
which the disaster was taken.
The literary section was dropped
in about 10 years, but revived in
1910 with several articles by alumni.
It was then dropped again and from
that time the trend was toward more
art and less writing.
Quad was edited by the junior
class until 1925 when the Associated
Students took it over. In that year
the page was increased to its pres
ent size.
From nearly the beginning color
was used by professional artists
until 1939 when the students deco
rated the book themselves and color
photography was first used.
Jokes? Ha! Ha!
The comic section changed as col
lege humor did. "Joshes" was the
title for several years, then "Razz"
took over. From year to year the
advertising pages were interspersed
with various living groups' appeals
for new members. Biblical parodies
were printed occasionally for the
lighter side of the book.
In 1939 the comic section disap
peared. Candid shots about campus
occupied a larger space than ever
before. The later Quads have been
concentrated more and more on be
ing a photographic record of Stan
ford with emphasis on outstanding
figures and events in student life.
Since the student association took
over Quad in 1925 the editor and
business manager have been ap
pointed rather than elected. Any
one may try out for a staff position
and appointments are made on the
basis of work accomplished and
ability.
