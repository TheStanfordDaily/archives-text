# Can We Afford to Scuttle Bretton Woods?

Editor's nolo: This is the seventh
in a series of articles on the post
war world.

Someone has declared that "it <is
possible that not the least guilty
among the authors of the war were
those of us who desired only to be
let alone to live in peace. Having
turnd our faces inward after the last
war, we must safeguard the future
this time by working with other na
tions toward a common end," said
Dr. Theodore H. Boggs of the Eco
nomics Department.
"This is especially applicable to
economic isolation," he stressed, "for
all our great world plans will avail
us little if we fail to revive world
trade."
We Face Economic Decision
"The American people face a
great decision," he said. "We have
the opportunity to choose between
a program of economic isolation or
one of international cooperation."
"The latter program is desirable,
indeed is imperative, not for reasons
of altruism towards Europe, but to
serve our own American interests.
For we must help to create a world
of customers with the purchasing
power to buy American goods. Only
thus can American producers and
exporters expand their scale of oper
ations. We must avoid a world of
needy and poverty-stricken custo
mers.
"It is not as easy to create and
maintain peace as it was imagined in
1919. By that stern teacher, bitter
experience, we have been taught to
see that a fundamental factor in
maintaining friendly relations be
tween nations is the establishment of
a reasonably free flow of trade be
tween them.
"We now realize that if we are
to have high and expanding levels
of employment, production, and
prosperity in the postwar years we
cannot depend alone on domestic
ma rkets.
Employment Needs Foreign Trade
"I want at this point to quote Pro
fessor Seymour Harris of Harvard.
We in America,' he declares, 'are
counting on eight billion dollars of
exports per year and five million jobs
from foreign trade in the postwar
world. This is an important ingre
dient in our program for a full-em
ployment income. If the British are
forced to embark on bilateralism, ex
change control, cartels and the like,
then a large part of the hoped-for
growth of our American export
trade, from three billion dollai-s an
nually in the prewar period to eight
billion dollars in the postwar period
will not be forthcoming. The loss of
a large part of this eight billion dol

! lars of export trade will be serious
j indeed.' And Professor Harris re
| minds us 'that Britain and other
countries will probably feel obliged
to embark upon programs such as
those suggested above unless means
can be devised to assure an ever
expanding volume of international
trade'."
Trade Needs Cooperation
"A progressively expanding econ
] omy, marked by rising standards of
output and income, demands inter
{ national cooperative action. Expand
j ing export markets will be made
I available only by all countries pull
j ing themselves up to rising-income
j levels and increased imports from
] abroad, not by pulling themselves
i down through all kinds of trade re
j strictions which must inevitably fol
; low if the Bretton Woods conference
! programs fail to achieve their main
purposes.
"Representatives of 44 United and
i Associated Nations met in July, 1944.
I at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.
Their final agreement included the
establishment of two separate or
ganizations to deal with two distinct
problems.
Bretton Woods' Finance Plans
"First, is the International Mone
tary Fund, with a capital of $8,800,-
000.000. of which the United States
will contribute $2,750,000,000. Sec
ond, is the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development,
with an authorized capital of $10,-
000,000,000, of which our share is $3,-
! 175,000.000.
"The central objective of the In
ternational Monetary Fund is the re
vival and expansion of international
trade. It aims to eliminate unneces
sary exchange risks by promoting
exchange stability, and it establishes
a procedure for the orderly adop
j tion of such changes in exchange
rates as may be agreed to be
necessary.
Cut Down Trade Restrictions
"The fund aims also to eliminate
destructive practices which inter
fered with the flow of world trade
before the war, such as indiscrimi
nate exchange restrictions, multiple
currency practices, and bilateral
clearing agreements, and to assure
member countries that the proceeds
of sales to any one member can be
used for the purchase of goods from
any other member.
"In brief, the fund is designed to
| assist in the establishment of a
! multilateral system of payments in
respect to trade and other trans
actions.

"The fund proposes to re-establish j
international currencies on a gold
basis, but to eliminate or moderate
the disturbing rigidities which char
acterized the gold standard. One
important difference between the
old gold standard world and the one
visualized under the International
Monetary Fund is that such adjust
ments as might have to be made in
exchange rates are intended to be
orderly, systematic, noncompetitive
and to be taken in the light of full
information and consultation with an
impartial body. They will not in
volve a breakdown of established
machinery, as they did over and over
again under the original gold stand
ard.
"It may he said in criticism of
the Bretton Woods proposals that
we Americans as a creditor na
tion, are giving all and getting
nothing in return. However, this
criticism has no more validity than
the argument that a merchant has
nothing to gain by advancing credit
to his customers.
Reconstruction Plans
"While the Monetary Fund aims
at greater stability of conditions in
world trade and is concerned with
the member countries' short term
foreign exchange requirements, the
Bank for Reconstruction and Devel
opment is intended to promote the
international flow of long-term cap
ital.
"By direct loans (a) of its own re
sources and (b) of such funds as it
may itself borrow, and (c) by guar
anteeing loans made by private in
vestors ,the bank is expected to help
in (1) the restoration of economies
destroyed or disrupted by war, (2)
the reconversion of productive facili
ties to peacetime needs, and (3) the
development of productive facilities
and resources in less developed
countries. It is intended indirectly
also to exert a salutary influence on
terms and conditions of all interna
tional investments.
"Since the bank would make or
guarantee only such loans as the
borrower could not obtain else
where on reasonable terms, the
hank is intended to promote rather
than to hinder the How of private
funds into international invest

should be congratulated on not
breaking down with the weight of
insoluble conflicts, feels Dr. Boggs.

"It is true that once the fund and

nations can be outvoted, for the vot
ing power will then be distributed
according to capital investment. But
the democratic procedure through
out the conference showed a desire
on the part of the delegates to be
fair and reasonable. Also, it offers
definite hope of future success.
"The plans finally agreed upon
were probably not precisely what
any one country working by itself
would have drafted as ideal. They
were the product of give and take,
a compromise, but a fair and work

"Representatives of 44 United and

Their final agreement included the
establishment of two separate or

problems.
Bretton Woods' Finance Plans
"First, is the International Mone
tary Fund, with a capital of $8,800,-

will contribute $2,750,000,000. Sec

"The central objective of the In

trade. It aims to eliminate unneces
sary exchange risks by promoting

rates as may be agreed to be

"The fund aims also to eliminate

important difference between the

Monetary Fund is that such adjust

exchange rates are intended to be
orderly, systematic, noncompetitive
and to be taken in the light of full

impartial body. They will not in
volve a breakdown of established

the Bretton Woods proposals that

Reconstruction Plans
"While the Monetary Fund aims
at greater stability of conditions in
world trade and is concerned with

foreign exchange requirements, the

"By direct loans (a) of its own re

"The fund aims also to eliminate

Trade Needs Cooperation

purposes.
"Representatives of 44 United and
i Associated Nations met in July, 1944.
I at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.
Their final agreement included the
establishment of two separate or
ganizations to deal with two distinct
problems.
Bretton Woods' Finance Plans
"First, is the International Mone
tary Fund, with a capital of $8,800,-
000.000. of which the United States
will contribute $2,750,000,000. Sec
ond, is the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development,
with an authorized capital of $10,-
000,000,000, of which our share is $3,-
! 175,000.000.
"The central objective of the In
ternational Monetary Fund is the re
vival and expansion of international
trade. It aims to eliminate unneces
sary exchange risks by promoting
exchange stability, and it establishes
a procedure for the orderly adop
j tion of such changes in exchange
rates as may be agreed to be
necessary.
Cut Down Trade Restrictions
"The fund aims also to eliminate
destructive practices which inter
fered with the flow of world trade
before the war, such as indiscrimi
nate exchange restrictions, multiple
currency practices, and bilateral
clearing agreements, and to assure
member countries that the proceeds
of sales to any one member can be
used for the purchase of goods from
any other member.
"In brief, the fund is designed to
| assist in the establishment of a
! multilateral system of payments in
respect to trade and other trans
actions.

"The fund proposes to re-establish j
international currencies on a gold
basis, but to eliminate or moderate
the disturbing rigidities which char
acterized the gold standard. One
important difference between the
old gold standard world and the one
visualized under the International
Monetary Fund is that such adjust
ments as might have to be made in
exchange rates are intended to be
orderly, systematic, noncompetitive
and to be taken in the light of full
information and consultation with an
impartial body. They will not in
volve a breakdown of established
machinery, as they did over and over
again under the original gold stand
ard.
"It may he said in criticism of
the Bretton Woods proposals that
we Americans as a creditor na
tion, are giving all and getting
nothing in return. However, this
criticism has no more validity than
the argument that a merchant has
nothing to gain by advancing credit
to his customers.
Reconstruction Plans
"While the Monetary Fund aims
at greater stability of conditions in
world trade and is concerned with
the member countries' short term
foreign exchange requirements, the
Bank for Reconstruction and Devel
opment is intended to promote the
international flow of long-term cap
ital.
"By direct loans (a) of its own re
sources and (b) of such funds as it
may itself borrow, and (c) by guar
anteeing loans made by private in
vestors ,the bank is expected to help
in (1) the restoration of economies
destroyed or disrupted by war, (2)
the reconversion of productive facili
ties to peacetime needs, and (3) the
development of productive facilities
and resources in less developed
countries. It is intended indirectly
also to exert a salutary influence on
terms and conditions of all interna
tional investments.
"Since the bank would make or
guarantee only such loans as the
borrower could not obtain else
where on reasonable terms, the
hank is intended to promote rather
than to hinder the How of private
funds into international invest
ment channels.

should be congratulated on not
breaking down with the weight of
insoluble conflicts, feels Dr. Boggs.

ground.
Democratic Example
"Procedure in the conference was
democratic. Delegates of the smallest
nations, Iceland, Luxemburg and
Panama, sat side by side with dele
gates of the great nations. Every
country had an equal vote, and even
the smallest had a hearing and re
ceived serious consideration.
"It is true that once the fund and
bank are in operation, the smaller
nations can be outvoted, for the vot
ing power will then be distributed
according to capital investment. But
the democratic procedure through
out the conference showed a desire
on the part of the delegates to be
fair and reasonable. Also, it offers
definite hope of future success.
"The plans finally agreed upon
were probably not precisely what
any one country working by itself
would have drafted as ideal. They
were the product of give and take,
a compromise, but a fair and work
able one.

posals or somewhat comparable
plans be developed, it would seem
