# War Bond Sales Reach 14 Pct. of Goal
## 
### 
Stanford's thermometer indicator in the Cellar inched upward today
as War Bond sales totaled 84000â€”approximately 14 per cent of the $27,500
goal, according to Mildred Edwards, bond chairman.
Concrete evidence of what those War Bond dollars will buy will be
shown students this afternoon from 3:30 to 5 when Lieut. Roane Sias, U.S.
Army Air Forces, brings to the campus an Army "duck" as part of the
nationwide Sixth War Loan drive.
t Bonds will be sold at the Cellar corner where the "duck" will be on
display along with regulation Army clothng, guns, and rations issued to
men in the tropics and in the Aleutians. If conditions permit, bond pur
chasers will be give nrides in the amphibious "duck," the type which is
being used to transport men and supplies to invasion beachheads.
Lieutenant Sias. a returned tighter pilot, has been touring Northern
California to demonstrate Army equipment and speak at war bond rallies
of his fighting career in Europe where he was shot down behind enemy
lines and then escaped from a prison camp. He will be assisted by Cor
poral Bowling.
Competition, meanwhile, was rising rapidly among hasher teams as War
Board issued subscription books last night and sent hashers on their way
to shake the shekels from pockets of living group members.
War Board Co-ordinator Jeannette Grimsley has asked that all living
group members co-operate with their hashers to boost their war bond
sales totals. Any sales through auctions to be held next week in Univer
sity residences will count toward the hasher crews' credit.
