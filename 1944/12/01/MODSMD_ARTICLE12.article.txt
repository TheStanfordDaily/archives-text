# Gaieties Opens Tonight: Proceeds Aids Veterans
## 
### 
Proceeds from Gaieties' ticket sales will go to assist the "Dimes for
Diplomas" drive, and Stanford men and women veterans returning to major
in dramatics will find scholarships awaiting them.
The curtain of Memorial Auditorium will fly up tonight at 8:15 to usher
in the big new 1944 edition of Stanford's Gaieties, complete with songs,

skits, specialties, and dances, and 4
directed this year by Peggy Fitts.
Gay '90's
It was back in the closing years
of the "Gay '90V that the Gaieties
first began to startle Stanford stu
dents from their mid-term lethargy
with a riotous revue, and for years
since the annual production of Ram's
Head was known as "Big Game Gai
eties." This year, without a Big
Game, and in spite of wartime re
strictions, Rani's Head has gone
ahead to put out a show to rival
anything ever done before.
The opener, "This Time," words by
Peggy Fitts and music by Leslie Al
exander, will be followed by a spe
cialty skit called "Daring Young
Man" with Willie Davis. Just what
the young man is daring enough to
do will remain a mystery until to
night.
The Show Goes On
"Hot Shot with a Ballet Plot" is
the impressive title plastered on the
program for the next act, which will
feature a bit of low boogie beat. Fol
lowing that, Herb Wilson will sing
"If I Could Only Write a Song,"
Danny Hughes' original tune.
"Joe on the Row," which prom
ises to have some connection with
Stanford life, is a skit to be pre
sented next, and then Leslie Alex
ander will sing "The Color Is Blue,"
written by Leslie Alexander.
Samba
Latin America will bombshell its
way into Gaieties with a flashy
Samba, performed by a talented
group of hip-swaying students be
fore a huge backdrop designed es
pecially for the dance.
"Pit Skit." a bit of a hit, will come
next on the evening's entertainment,
and then Johnny High, associate di
rector of the show and star of "Do
ver Road," will present a specialty.
Takeoff
A modern dance takeoff will then
be given, and, just before inter
mission time, "Gone with the Gaie
ties" will close the first act.
The second portion of the show
will open with a tap number to Dick
Besoyer's "You Look Just Like
Margie." Jackie Cannon will come
on with Jo Green's tune, "Blue In
terlude," and then a musical skit en
titled "The Time of Your Libe" will
be presented.
Magic
Doug Dulac is scheduled to mys
tify the campus with his magic show,
and then Jackie Cannon and Bob
Gettys will get together on another
of Jo Green's originals, "Reminis
cing."
"Pot Skit" will then come along,
and following that Herb Wilson will
be featured again in a blues number
entitled "Hot Ice." Johnny High is
slated for another specialty, and the
finale appropriately called "Gaieties
Goes On" will close the show.
Janice Shaughnessy is assistant
director and dance director for this
production, and Corky Wollman is
technical director.

Magic
Doug Dulac is scheduled to mys
tify the campus with his magic show,
and then Jackie Cannon and Bob
Gettys will get together on another
of Jo Green's originals, "Reminis
cing."
"Pot Skit" will then come along,
and following that Herb Wilson will
be featured again in a blues number
entitled "Hot Ice." Johnny High is
slated for another specialty, and the
finale appropriately called "Gaieties
Goes On" will close the show.
Janice Shaughnessy is assistant
director and dance director for this
production, and Corky Wollman is
technical director.
Proceeds from Gaieties' ticket sales will go to assist the "Dimes for
Diplomas" drive, and Stanford men and women veterans returning to major
in dramatics will find scholarships awaiting them.
The curtain of Memorial Auditorium will fly up tonight at 8:15 to usher
in the big new 1944 edition of Stanford's Gaieties, complete with songs,

skits, specialties, and dances, and 4
directed this year by Peggy Fitts.
Gay '90's
It was back in the closing years
of the "Gay '90V that the Gaieties
first began to startle Stanford stu
dents from their mid-term lethargy
with a riotous revue, and for years
since the annual production of Ram's
Head was known as "Big Game Gai
eties." This year, without a Big
Game, and in spite of wartime re
strictions, Rani's Head has gone
ahead to put out a show to rival
anything ever done before.
The opener, "This Time," words by
Peggy Fitts and music by Leslie Al
exander, will be followed by a spe
cialty skit called "Daring Young
Man" with Willie Davis. Just what
the young man is daring enough to
do will remain a mystery until to
night.
The Show Goes On
"Hot Shot with a Ballet Plot" is
the impressive title plastered on the
program for the next act, which will
feature a bit of low boogie beat. Fol
lowing that, Herb Wilson will sing
"If I Could Only Write a Song,"
Danny Hughes' original tune.
"Joe on the Row," which prom
ises to have some connection with
Stanford life, is a skit to be pre
sented next, and then Leslie Alex
ander will sing "The Color Is Blue,"
written by Leslie Alexander.
Samba
Latin America will bombshell its
way into Gaieties with a flashy
Samba, performed by a talented
group of hip-swaying students be
fore a huge backdrop designed es
pecially for the dance.
"Pit Skit." a bit of a hit, will come
next on the evening's entertainment,
and then Johnny High, associate di
rector of the show and star of "Do
ver Road," will present a specialty.
Takeoff
A modern dance takeoff will then
be given, and, just before inter
mission time, "Gone with the Gaie
ties" will close the first act.
The second portion of the show
will open with a tap number to Dick
Besoyer's "You Look Just Like
Margie." Jackie Cannon will come
on with Jo Green's tune, "Blue In
terlude," and then a musical skit en
titled "The Time of Your Libe" will
be presented.
