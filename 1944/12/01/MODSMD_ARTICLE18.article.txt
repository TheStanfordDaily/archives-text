A newspaper is the "fifth wheel" of govern
ment; it occupies a unique position in the demo
cratic process for it is the only extra-political
agency by which the inarticulate mass of citi
zens can make themselves heard. A newspaper
represents a critical ideal; it serves according
to a precept of honesty in reflecting faults in the
structure or process of city, state, and federal
government.
But what about the Daily? Is it the function of
the Daily to reflect errors in student government,
faults in the structure, mistakes in administra
tion? We think it is, but in the situation peculiar
to Stanford a difficulty presents itself.
First of all, this student body represents a rela
tion of friendship, a tradition of "hello"—every
one knows everyone else—and the custom has
been for Stanford students to work together in
the interests of the community. Participation in
student government is voluntary; there is no
financial remuneration, and the tendency of stu
dent publications has been to encourage ama
teur political efforts that represent a sincere
attempt to aid the development of student gov
ernment and democracy at Stanford.
But in its long history the Daily has never
hesitated to bring out a problem that needed
honest discussion and examination by our stu
dent citizens. The problem right now is student
government—plus something that is fundamen
tally wrong in the student personality.
Stanford, and the concept of a responsible
press, are the justifications for the Daily's pres
entation of the problem; the solution is up to
you.
