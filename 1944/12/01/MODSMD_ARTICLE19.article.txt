# Bull Session

### Dick Crane 
This session should be reserved for the last
issue of my column, but after continually pan
ning the student body all week, I feel it is ap
propriate to end a weekly blasting by throw
ing a few bouguets in the university's direction.
No matter what its faults are, Stanford is in
reality the greatest school in the country. After
going to a college in the east, I find there is no
comparison between this university and any
other similar college or university in the
country.
What makes it so different or so much better?
Why, a great number of things. I like % the loca
tion, with its beautiful trees, well-kept lawns,
and the mountains forming a wonderful back
ground,
I like the architecture of the buildings, which
sort of breaks away from the usual "ivy-covered
vails" conception of a college, and makes Stan
:ord a beautiful exception rather than the usual
iniversity type.
I like the close contact between the faculty
and the students-the way you see, for exam
ple, a professor and student sitting and talking
in the Cellar over a cup of coffee.
I like the way a student can voice his opinion

about the manner in which the classes are being
taught, or the way the reader might mark his
paper, without fear of being condemned for it.
I like the method of the Honor Code, in so
far as it applies to academic work. It certainly
works wonders compared with systems that
are used in other universities and colleges.
I like the way the students run the university
through the medium of student government,
without interference from the university offi
cials. Such organizations as Men's Council and
Women's Conference are very ingenious ideas
of student government when it comes to han
dling the students' pioblems.
Above all, I like Stanford for itself. All of
the things I have mentioned help to make this
school a wonderful place to spend an important
part of your life, but more than that, Stanford
is, well, I don't know, it's just Stanford, and
that is all that is necessary to say.
One more bouquet for today and I am
through. The War Board is now in full speed
with regard to the Sixth War Loan, and huge
affairs, auctions, and other forms of competition
are in the offing for the stretch drive, which
will begin in earnest on Monday. It shouldn't
be necessary to have contests to sell bonds, but
I guess it is. The hashers of the various living
groups will hold contests between each other
to see who can sell the most bonds in their re
spective living groups. The whole trouble with
the idea is, the hashers are definitely unin
terested in doing the selling. This is the first
time this idea has ever been used, so if you are
a hasher, or are the girl friend of a hasher,
please talk the idea up to the lethargic people.
They are necessary to put the idea over. Thanks
a lot!

Why, a great number of things. I like % the loca
tion, with its beautiful trees, well-kept lawns,
and the mountains forming a wonderful back
ground,
I like the architecture of the buildings, which
sort of breaks away from the usual "ivy-covered
vails" conception of a college, and makes Stan
:ord a beautiful exception rather than the usual
iniversity type.
I like the close contact between the faculty
and the students-the way you see, for exam
ple, a professor and student sitting and talking
in the Cellar over a cup of coffee.
I like the way a student can voice his opinion

about the manner in which the classes are being
taught, or the way the reader might mark his
paper, without fear of being condemned for it.
I like the method of the Honor Code, in so
far as it applies to academic work. It certainly
works wonders compared with systems that
are used in other universities and colleges.
I like the way the students run the university
through the medium of student government,
without interference from the university offi
cials. Such organizations as Men's Council and
Women's Conference are very ingenious ideas
of student government when it comes to han
dling the students' pioblems.
Above all, I like Stanford for itself. All of
the things I have mentioned help to make this
school a wonderful place to spend an important
part of your life, but more than that, Stanford
is, well, I don't know, it's just Stanford, and
that is all that is necessary to say.
One more bouquet for today and I am
through. The War Board is now in full speed
with regard to the Sixth War Loan, and huge
affairs, auctions, and other forms of competition
are in the offing for the stretch drive, which
will begin in earnest on Monday. It shouldn't
be necessary to have contests to sell bonds, but
I guess it is. The hashers of the various living
groups will hold contests between each other
to see who can sell the most bonds in their re
spective living groups. The whole trouble with
the idea is, the hashers are definitely unin
terested in doing the selling. This is the first
time this idea has ever been used, so if you are
a hasher, or are the girl friend of a hasher,
please talk the idea up to the lethargic people.
They are necessary to put the idea over. Thanks
a lot!
This session should be reserved for the last
issue of my column, but after continually pan
ning the student body all week, I feel it is ap
propriate to end a weekly blasting by throw
ing a few bouguets in the university's direction.
No matter what its faults are, Stanford is in
reality the greatest school in the country. After
going to a college in the east, I find there is no
comparison between this university and any
other similar college or university in the
country.
What makes it so different or so much better?
Why, a great number of things. I like % the loca
tion, with its beautiful trees, well-kept lawns,
and the mountains forming a wonderful back
ground,
