# 'Gifts for G.I.'s'

### 
Representatives from all campus living groups for next week's "Gifts
for G.l.'s" collection met yesterday and planned how every student who
wants to contribute favorite records or books to hospitalized servicemen
may do so on Monday and through Friday of next week.
Not a drive, but "Stanford's voluntary Christmas present to wounded
or ill G.l.'s," the program will include collections by the representatives,
and individual donations placed in boxes around the campus. Two of these
boxes will be in the library, one in the Bookstore, and one in the Cellar.
Co-chairmen of the drive sponsored by Women's Conference, Jane
Reynolds and Sallie Van Dyke said that records, albums, and books which
are new or in good condition are needed for Army hospitals in the Bay
area. 'Each contribution will be marked as a 1944 Christmas gift from the
Stanford hall or student who offered it.
Among Literary Guild, Book of the Month Club, and other modern
novels specified by servicemen as their top choices are Green Dolphin
Street, Goudge; Strange Fruit, Smith; Leave Her to Heaven, Williams;
Random Harvest, Hilton; Hungry Hill, DuMaurier; Canary Row. Stein
beck; and Earth and High Heaven, Graham.
Popular Victor records on the list include:
Rhapsody of Blue. .'55822; I Dream Too Much, 4304; Smoke Gets in Your
Eyes, 24G09; In the Gloaming, 1275; and Amapola, 4552.
