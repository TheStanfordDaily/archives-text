Writing thousands of stories and explaining
the situation over and over would have no effect
upon the Board of Trustees for the inauguration
of basketball. They would do no good without
some concrete demand from the student body
as a whole.
A petition signed by a majority of the student
body and augmented by a resolution from Ex-
Com, would be a concrete expression of the de
sire of the students and would be evidence
which could be presented in a completed form
before the board.
Should such a petition be circulated and over
whelmingly accepted and signed by the stu
dents, the board would have to recognize the
true feelings of the students and should give
consideration to the situation which exists.
The board would have to agree to only two
things. The use of the name of Stanford for the
team and the use of the pavilion for playing the
games. Two simple enough requests which
could lead to the resumption of basketball in
intercollegiate class and an opportunity for the
Indians to see again a Stanford squad on a
court.
"Madame, there is a burglar at your back
door. Would you please inform your girls and
have them go to the front of the house for pro
tection? This is the Stanford Police Depart
ment." These words, uttered by a phantom
voice over the phone threw house mothers into
confusion and caused damsels, in full war paint
of retirement (curlers et al to tear downstairs
in full flight (not that any burglars would have
had a chance in any of the houses phoned), but
in true ladylike fashion they fled (some of this
last part is hearsay, of course, and is not an
eyewitness account).
When the burglars failed to appear (prob
ably the wisest move they have ever made) the
worried house mothers phoned the police, who
came and searched the various abodes only to
find none. While the police were there, the
mysterious voice called and said: "There are
several policemen at your front door. Would
you please go to the back of the house for pro
tection?" Seems like sort of a toss-up to me.
