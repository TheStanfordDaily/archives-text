# Fundamental Reasons Underlie Farm Actions

### JOEY NELL RYAN 
Tli ere are fundamental reasons
WHY "Stanford women do this and
do not do that."
Perhaps in many cases freshman
women do not, as yet, understand
these reasons." It is important that
they do understand and perhaps by
xmderstanding they will come to be
lieve in the Farm's traditions, its
student government, its principles.
Here are the clear-cut reasons un
derlying the actions of Stanford
women while they are on the Farm.
The Fundamental Standard
The Fundamental Standard is the
-ris by which the Stanford woman
slides her life while she is at Stan
ford.
Good citizenship emphasizing re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others is
expected of Stanford women.
A spirit of equality in prohibiting
excessive expenditures and the for
mation of undemocratic castes and
the prohibition of possession and use
of liquor by Farm students in the
University further sum up this
standard.
The Honor Code
The Honor Code had been drawn
up to make this standard and what
it implies understandable as applied
in bur academic life.
This code is not some vague,
ivory-tower concept but a tradition
which is actively practiced by all
Stanford students. It is the guaran

tee of freedom which binds Stan
ford students together in a common
tradition of pride, honor and hon
esty.
The Farm student is conscious of
this code every time he prepares an
assignment, gives a report or writes
an examination.
By accepting the right of the Hon
or Code the Stanfordite likewise
undertook the responsibility of see
ing that others as well as himself
obey the spirit and the letter of the
Code.
The Honor Code has been a suc
cess because it is supported by all
students individually and collec
tively.
Women violators of the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor
Code appear before Women's Coun
cil. The five students on Council act
somewhat as an informal court.
Women's Council, composed of five
Stanford students, is the judiciary
body, and is a part of student self
government. This self-government
pervades almost every phase of life
on the Farm.
When a clear or suspected viola
tion is reported to Council, the
chairman obtains all pertinent evi
dence. The student is then called
before Council to give her testimony.
It cannot be emphasized enough
that the whole of these proceedings
are secret. The members fo Coun
cil are personally pelged to keep all
confidences.
Council finds no glory in handling
these cases. They are very difficult
when the life-long consequences of
the decisions are realized.
Social Regulations
Women's Conference, composed of
the presidents of all the living
groups, has set up the Women's So
cial Regulations. Women's Council
enforces these rules for the social
conduct of women.
Women students have worked out
the Social Regulations as the pat
tern through which the Fundamen
tal Standard is expressed in their
social life. The late leave regula
tions are a part of the Social Regu
lations.
By obeying the Social Regulations
the Stanford student is upholding
the fundamental principles which lie
behind the regulations.
The representatives of Women's
Council in the various living groups
are Roble's Committee of Five, La
gunita's Committee of Seven, the
Row's Committee of Nine, Ventura's
Committee of Five, Union's Commit
tee of Ten, and Branner's Commit
tee of Five.
Many Social Regulation infrac
tions are handled by these local stu
dent groups. In general, gravity of
infraction or number of times the
offense has been committed decides
whether the case appears before the
local committee or Women's Council.

cial Regulations. Women's Council
enforces these rules for the social
conduct of women.
Women students have worked out
the Social Regulations as the pat
tern through which the Fundamen
tal Standard is expressed in their
social life. The late leave regula
tions are a part of the Social Regu
lations.
By obeying the Social Regulations
the Stanford student is upholding
the fundamental principles which lie
behind the regulations.
The representatives of Women's
Council in the various living groups
are Roble's Committee of Five, La
gunita's Committee of Seven, the
Row's Committee of Nine, Ventura's
Committee of Five, Union's Commit
tee of Ten, and Branner's Commit
tee of Five.
Many Social Regulation infrac
tions are handled by these local stu
dent groups. In general, gravity of
infraction or number of times the
offense has been committed decides
whether the case appears before the
local committee or Women's Council.
Tli ere are fundamental reasons
WHY "Stanford women do this and
do not do that."
Perhaps in many cases freshman
women do not, as yet, understand
these reasons." It is important that
they do understand and perhaps by
xmderstanding they will come to be
lieve in the Farm's traditions, its
student government, its principles.
Here are the clear-cut reasons un
derlying the actions of Stanford
women while they are on the Farm.
The Fundamental Standard
The Fundamental Standard is the
-ris by which the Stanford woman
slides her life while she is at Stan
ford.
Good citizenship emphasizing re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others is
expected of Stanford women.
A spirit of equality in prohibiting
excessive expenditures and the for
mation of undemocratic castes and
the prohibition of possession and use
of liquor by Farm students in the
University further sum up this
standard.
The Honor Code
The Honor Code had been drawn
up to make this standard and what
it implies understandable as applied
in bur academic life.
This code is not some vague,
ivory-tower concept but a tradition
which is actively practiced by all
Stanford students. It is the guaran

tee of freedom which binds Stan
ford students together in a common
tradition of pride, honor and hon
esty.
The Farm student is conscious of
this code every time he prepares an
assignment, gives a report or writes
an examination.
By accepting the right of the Hon
or Code the Stanfordite likewise
undertook the responsibility of see
ing that others as well as himself
obey the spirit and the letter of the
Code.
The Honor Code has been a suc
cess because it is supported by all
students individually and collec
tively.
Women violators of the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor
Code appear before Women's Coun
cil. The five students on Council act
somewhat as an informal court.
Women's Council, composed of five
Stanford students, is the judiciary
body, and is a part of student self
government. This self-government
pervades almost every phase of life
on the Farm.
When a clear or suspected viola
tion is reported to Council, the
chairman obtains all pertinent evi
dence. The student is then called
before Council to give her testimony.
It cannot be emphasized enough
that the whole of these proceedings
are secret. The members fo Coun
cil are personally pelged to keep all
confidences.
Council finds no glory in handling
these cases. They are very difficult
when the life-long consequences of
the decisions are realized.

the presidents of all the living
groups, has set up the Women's So
cial Regulations. Women's Council
