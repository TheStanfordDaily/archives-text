# Ballet Russe Presents Mediocre Performance
## 
### DOROTHY WILLMER 
The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo
appeared at Memorial Auditorium on
Wednesday in an extremely medi
ocre performance of "Les Sylphides,"
"Rodeo," "The Bluebird," and the
"Cuckold's Fair."
"Les Sylphides," was mechanical,
lackadaisical, and inferior techni
cally. The principals were indifferent
and didn't attempt to cope with the
interpretive needs of their roles.
Nicholas Magallanes was especially
outstanding for his inadequacy, sub
stituting forced deliberate move
ments for the ethereality and under
lying virility the role demands.
Although he made a much better
showing in "Rodeo," the honors there
went to Dorothy Etheridge and Yu
rek Lazowski. Miss Etheridge over
acted, perhaps not realizing the size
of Memorial Auditorium, and Mr.
Lazowski's smile became a trifle me
chanical, but this is quibbling. Miss
DeMille's choreography is still a joy
to watch, but the entire cast hammed
to a distressing degree. The whole
performance needs a general tight
ening up.
In "The Bluebird," Natalia Krass
ovski, one of the outstanding baller
inas of today, unfortunately, was not
up to par. But Leon Danelian, who
within the past two years has become
an extremely fine dancer, was in top
form.
"The Cuckold's Fair" was in the
anomalous position of being neither
chicken nor egg. Except for Ruth
anna Boris, none of the cast was able
to catch the technique or the spirit
of Spanish dancing. However, Miss
Boris was excellent, revealing not
only a fine command of the Spanish

idiom, but also a charming gift for
comedy.
