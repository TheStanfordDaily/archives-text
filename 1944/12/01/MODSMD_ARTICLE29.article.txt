# War Tower Holds Noted Collection
## 
### GLORIA BROOKS 
(Ed. note: This is the first of a series of two articles on the Hoover
War Library.

Within the 16-story tower of the Hoover Library on War, Revolution
and Peace lies one of the greatest single collections in the world of mili
tary, social and political material relating to World War I and the after
math which led to World War 11. Our collection ranks with the twa other
great world collections housed in the "Bibliotheque et Musee de la Guerre"

in Vincennes, France, and the
'"Weltkreigsbucherei in Stuttgart,
Germany, whose present fate is un
known.
From the tier upon tier of original
records, many scholars have gleaned
the facts with which to point out
how costly have been our mistakes
Â«nd how inadequate our knowledge
of war and peace.
Since its dedication in June 1941,
the Library has furnished source
material in our own publication se
ries, many of them by Stanford pro
fessors. Ralph Lutz, Professor of
History and Director of the Hoover
Library, wrote the first in the series,
entitled "Fall of the German Em
pire."
Others include "The Bolshevik
Revolution" by Harold Fisher, Di
rector of the Hoover Library, and
James Bunyan; "Raymond Poin
care and the French Presidency" by
Gorden Wright, and the latest, "Or
ganization of American Relief in
Europe, 1918-19," by Bane and Lutz.
Many books outside the publication
series have been written by schol
ars from research here. For ex
ample, "Problems of a Lasting
Peace" by Herbert Hoover and Hugh
Gibson, and a book published this
year by Konrad Heiden, "Der Fueh
rer."
Valuable Research
W. H. Chamberlin, formerly of the
Christian Science Monitor, has writ
ten of these books: "One of the most
valuable and stimulating pieces of

research finds expression in the se
ries of books which come from the
rich reserves of the Hoover War
Library."
The idea of the Hoover Library
had its inception in President Hoo
ver's desire that the problems he en
countered in aiding helpless Euro
pean war victims in 1914 should not
be lost to the world. After starting
a collection in the Commission for
Relief in Belgium. Hoover cabled
Stanford in the spring of 1919 that
$5,000 was available for the forming
of a new commission to collect and
organize World War I records.
Dr. Adams Chosen for Task
Ray Lyman Wilbur, then Presi
dent of Stanford, sent Dr. Ephraim
D. Adams of the history faculty over
to the Peace Conference where he
was able to get complete records
from many countries. However,
these form only the nucleus of the
present collection, for the proposed
library continued after the war to
record such developments as the rise
of national socialism, communism
and fascism.
One of the most interesting and
valuable documents pertaining to
World War I is the noted under
ground publication "Le Libre Bel
gique," published during the first
German occupation of Belgium. In
cidentally, this publication was re
sumed in 1940 after the reoccupa
tion. There are records of such
shori-lived postwar governments as
the Far Eastern Republic of Siberia.
Handsome bound volumes from the
library of the Czar and Czarina of
Russia and others of "Europe's ill
fated royalty" and a naval code book
that says, "This book is weighted in
lead and if thrown overboard will
sink," are other unusual documents.
Lois of Material
To give some idea of the magni
tude of the Hoover Library collec
tions, there are 25,000 volumes of
government documents from 60
countries, 95,000 odd books and
pamphlets, 3,000 titles of newspapers,
13,000 serials, 31,800 posters, publi
cations from 4,825 societies further
ing special causes, and 3,000 military
and naval maps.
It contains the only complete set
of propaganda materials of the peace
conference. There are also motion
picture films of various relief or
ganizations like the Commission for
Relief in Belgium, the Red Cross and
the American Relief Administration,
as well as inflation currency from
post-war Europe and the best Rus
sian collection outside the USSR,
covering the Imperial Regime, Revo
lution and Soviet periods.
