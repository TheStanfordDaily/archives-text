# Hoover War Libe Exhibits Famous Propaganda Pamphlets of This War
## 
### RUTH BENJAMIN 
Propaganda pamphlets now on
display in the West Exhibit Room,
first floor, of the Hoover Library
proved interesting to your roaming
reporter. There are three groups of
leaflets—those dropped over Italy
and Pantelleria by the Allied forces
in 1943, those dropped by the Allies
over German lines in the Normandy
invasion this year, and those dropped
by Germany over American forces
in Normandy.
Included in the leaflets dropped
over Italy is a cartoon picturing the
Italian geographic boot "kicking
Mussolini out."
Resistance Discouraged
Another pamphlet dropped over
Italy in 1943 reads in part, when
translated, "President Roosevelt, in
a press interview on June 11 after
the fall of Pantelleria, said the hope
and intention of the United Nations
is that Italy be restored to nation
hood and take its place as a re
spected member of Europe."
Then with the exclamation, "Ital
ians!" the leaflet continues, "The les
son of Pantelleria is clear. The Axis'
defeat is inevitable in view of our
overwhelming superiority in men,
machines, and materiel, a superior
ity which your own leaders have ad
mitted openly again and again.
"Just as the resistance of Pantel
leria only increased the suffering of
the garrison without purpose, thus
the longer there is resistance on your
part the greater will be the devasta

tion of Italy, also without purpose."
Messages from Iligh-Ups
Included also in these leaflets arc
a message to the Italian people by
Winston Churchill, the ultimatum
warning to the people of Pantelleria
Island by Lt. Gen. Carl Spaatz, a
warning to the people of Lampedusa
by Andrew Cunningham, and other
messages by important American
and British war figures.
In the second group of propa
ganda pamphlets—those dropped by
the Allies over German forces in
Normandy—is a significant leaflet
with two pictures, one of Rommel
inspecting the Atlantic Wall and one
of the Allies' Normandy landing.
Poster in German
Above the first picture is a large
caption in German which is trans
lated "Propaganda" with a statement
of Adolph Hitler's, Sept. 30, 1942, un
derneath. Captioning the second
picture on the leaflet is "Reality,"
and a sentence reporting that the
picture was taken nine hours after
the first Normandy landing.
The importance of this is that Hit
ler's statement was, "I can assure
Mr. Churchill wherever he may
choose to start a second front he
can consider himself fortunate if he
remains nine hours on land."
Passports Dropped
Also dropped over the German
lines were safe-conduct papers
guaranteeing good treatment to the
German soldier if he would sur
render himself.

But the propaganda leaflets that
were dropped by the Germans over
American forces are the most amus
ing ones. It is easy to note that they
serve no purpose—they are so ob
viously pure propaganda that they
are only comical.
Germans Misinterpret
In the first place, the German
propaganda "experts" have inter
preted German to English in many
cases so that the word-sequence is
like the German language—for ex
ample, "The robot bombs are drop
ping over England explosives."
In the second place, there arg
many humorous instances of the
choice of a wrong word, such as
"Will you ever hear her 'sweat' voice
again?" as a caption for a picture of
a girl speaking on a telephone (pic
ture stolen from an American mag
azine). "They (Britishers) have the
'neck' (instead of 'nerve') to look
down on you Americans as a be
nighted bounder and a hay-seed."
Nazis' English Poor
Many more examples could be
noted, including "Show the world
that you 'have still gotten' some
horse-sense left." It seems German
interpreters wouldn't pass Stanford's
English A.
These leaflets will be on exhibit
for about two weeks.

OWI Issues leaflets
Those dropped over German
forces in Normandy, summer of 1944,
are the gift of Dr. Nathan van Pat
ten, Director of University Libraries.
Propaganda pamphlets now on
display in the West Exhibit Room,
first floor, of the Hoover Library
proved interesting to your roaming
reporter. There are three groups of
leaflets—those dropped over Italy
and Pantelleria by the Allied forces
in 1943, those dropped by the Allies
over German lines in the Normandy
invasion this year, and those dropped
by Germany over American forces
in Normandy.
Included in the leaflets dropped
over Italy is a cartoon picturing the
Italian geographic boot "kicking
Mussolini out."
Resistance Discouraged
Another pamphlet dropped over
Italy in 1943 reads in part, when
translated, "President Roosevelt, in
a press interview on June 11 after
the fall of Pantelleria, said the hope
and intention of the United Nations
is that Italy be restored to nation
hood and take its place as a re
spected member of Europe."
Then with the exclamation, "Ital
ians!" the leaflet continues, "The les
son of Pantelleria is clear. The Axis'
defeat is inevitable in view of our
overwhelming superiority in men,
machines, and materiel, a superior
ity which your own leaders have ad
mitted openly again and again.
"Just as the resistance of Pantel
leria only increased the suffering of
the garrison without purpose, thus
the longer there is resistance on your
part the greater will be the devasta

tion of Italy, also without purpose."
Messages from Iligh-Ups
Included also in these leaflets arc
a message to the Italian people by
Winston Churchill, the ultimatum
warning to the people of Pantelleria
Island by Lt. Gen. Carl Spaatz, a
warning to the people of Lampedusa
by Andrew Cunningham, and other
messages by important American
and British war figures.
In the second group of propa
ganda pamphlets—those dropped by
the Allies over German forces in
Normandy—is a significant leaflet
with two pictures, one of Rommel
inspecting the Atlantic Wall and one
of the Allies' Normandy landing.
Poster in German
Above the first picture is a large
caption in German which is trans
lated "Propaganda" with a statement
of Adolph Hitler's, Sept. 30, 1942, un
derneath. Captioning the second
picture on the leaflet is "Reality,"
and a sentence reporting that the
picture was taken nine hours after
the first Normandy landing.
The importance of this is that Hit
ler's statement was, "I can assure
Mr. Churchill wherever he may
choose to start a second front he
can consider himself fortunate if he
remains nine hours on land."
Passports Dropped
Also dropped over the German
lines were safe-conduct papers
guaranteeing good treatment to the
German soldier if he would sur
render himself.

But the propaganda leaflets that
were dropped by the Germans over
American forces are the most amus

serve no purpose—they are so ob
viously pure propaganda that they
are only comical.

caption in German which is trans
lated "Propaganda" with a statement
of Adolph Hitler's, Sept. 30, 1942, un
derneath. Captioning the second
picture on the leaflet is "Reality,"
and a sentence reporting that the
picture was taken nine hours after
the first Normandy landing.
The importance of this is that Hit
ler's statement was, "I can assure
Mr. Churchill wherever he may
choose to start a second front he
can consider himself fortunate if he
remains nine hours on land."
Passports Dropped
Also dropped over the German
lines were safe-conduct papers
guaranteeing good treatment to the
German soldier if he would sur
render himself.

But the propaganda leaflets that
were dropped by the Germans over
American forces are the most amus
ing ones. It is easy to note that they
serve no purpose—they are so ob
viously pure propaganda that they
are only comical.
Germans Misinterpret
In the first place, the German
propaganda "experts" have inter
preted German to English in many
cases so that the word-sequence is
like the German language—for ex
ample, "The robot bombs are drop
ping over England explosives."
In the second place, there arg
many humorous instances of the
choice of a wrong word, such as
"Will you ever hear her 'sweat' voice
again?" as a caption for a picture of
a girl speaking on a telephone (pic
ture stolen from an American mag
azine). "They (Britishers) have the
'neck' (instead of 'nerve') to look
down on you Americans as a be
nighted bounder and a hay-seed."
Nazis' English Poor
Many more examples could be
noted, including "Show the world
that you 'have still gotten' some
horse-sense left." It seems German
interpreters wouldn't pass Stanford's
English A.
These leaflets will be on exhibit
for about two weeks.
OWI Issues leaflets
Those dropped over German
forces in Normandy, summer of 1944,
are the gift of Dr. Nathan van Pat
ten, Director of University Libraries.
