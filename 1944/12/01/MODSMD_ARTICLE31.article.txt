# Stanford Trains Nurses in City
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
Though their classes aren't on the
Quad, members of the Stanford
School of Nursing, located at Stan
ford Lane Hospital in San Francisco,
are an integral part of Stanford
University. The school was estab
lished as Lane Hospital Training
School for Nurses in 1895.
In 1908, when the properties of
Lane Hospital and Cooper Medical
College were transferred to Stan
ford University, the name was
hanged to the Stanford School for
Nurses and later to the Stanford
University School of Nursing.
School of Medicine
A part of the School of Medicine
and under the direction of the Clin
ical Committee, the School fo Nurs
ing is headed at present by Miss
Sally Heitman, acting in the absence
of Miss Minnie Pohe, who was called
:o the National Council of Nursing
several years ago.
Two classes enter the School of
Nursing each year, one in September
and one in February. Admissions
are granted after lower division and
certain science requirements have
been fulfilled, totaling 90 university
units, with a C average. Creden
tials are accepted from other schools
as well as Stanford.
Clinical Work
Since upper division nursing cur
riculum includes clinical work, three
years are required for graduation in
comparison with two years in most
departments of the University. A
3achelor of Arts degree from Stan
ford University and the diploma of
the School of Nursing mark success
ful completion of the course.
It is possible to attend the Stan
ford School of Nursing under the
auspices of the U.S. Cadet Nurse
Corps, providing all of the admission
requirements governing the en
trance of independent students have
been fulfilled.

Expenses
All nursing school expenses of
cadet nurses are paid by the gov
ernment. Besides this the cadets re
ceive a nominal cash allowance.
At the termination of their course,
they are required to remain in the
nursing profession until six months
after the duration of the present
war.
Stanford Nurses
Though all students in the School
of Nursing are Stanford women,
many of them have never actually
seen the campus. For the purpose of
acquainting these students who had
their pre-nursing training at some
other school, a pre-nursing club has
been formed on campus.
Members of this club act as host
esses and guides for students of the
School of Nursing when they come
down from San Francisco to visit
Stanford. In turn, the pre-nursing
club is invited to visit the School
of Nursing.
Spring Sing
Last spring at the song fest on
campus, a group of cadet nurses
from Stanford Lane Hospital won
honorable mention with an impres
sive rendition of the Stanford Cadet
Nurse Corps song, written by Doro
thy Lane, Class of 1947-48, Stanford
School of Nursing.
Miss Mary Yost, Stanford Dean of
Women and an ardent supporter of
nursing, commented, "The girls
looked so trim in their grey uni
formsâ€”l was so proud of them that
I almost burst! They showed the
kind of vitality and spirit people
have when they have some real
purpose in life.
Peacetime Occupation
"Besides being of vital service to
her country, the girl who trains for
the nursing profession is preparing
herself for a permanent peace-time
occupation, one that will not be hin
dered by male competition.
