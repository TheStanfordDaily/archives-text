LAURA—now playing at the Stan
ford Theater.
Twentieth Century-Fox comes up
with a pleasant surprise in "Laura,"
a tale of murder among the sophis
ticates. Clifton Webb and Vincent
Price in feature roles are both ex
cellent.

Gene Tierney in
J the title role por
trays a career
woman with a
host of admirers,
among them the
I egotistical Clifton
Webb, a critic's
critic, and the
dangling Vincent
Price, one of those
perpetual house-

guests. Laura is supposedly mur
dered and Inspector Dana Andrews
is called in. As the plot unfolds the
usual number of surprises come to
light and the usual diabolical mur
derer is apprehended.
"Whod u nit"
"Laura" is definitely a superior
"whodunit" thanks mainly to the
performances of Messrs. Webb and
Price. In fact, Mr. Webb might
even be called "the rich man's
Monty Woolley."
There is nothing earth - shaking
about "Laura," but it is 90 minutes
of absorbing entertainment.
Second "Hit"
"The Shadow of Suspicion" casts
itself over the screen in the guise of
the second feature. Stealthily we
crawl from our hard theater seat
and slide down the aisle toward the
nearest exit. We reach the lobby,
quicken our step, and dash out into

University Avenue where the fresh,
clean California air revives oui
deadened senses. This should bt
enough to let you know that the
second feature is a terrible mess
worthy of being shown only to v
Biology I class.—Bower
