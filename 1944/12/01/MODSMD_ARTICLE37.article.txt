If it weren't for the Army-Navy
game Saturday, you wouldn't be
reading this; but since that is by all
odds the greatest contest of the year,
your faithful staff of football experts
has dropped in again to give you a
lew well-chosen tips as to where to
lay your dough. Your humble cor
respondents of this week are "Blar
ney" Gugel, Mort Cohen, Gondon
Levy, and "Bilge" Adams. Sports
editor Jim Weinberg dropped from
the list of regulars by absenting him
self from the presnt sssion to go
south for the winter. And now the
tips.
Army-Navy
Army over Navy by 14. This is the
r ame that all real grid fans have
been looking forward to for weeks,
undoubtedly the most important in
the nation this year, it will probably
decide the mythical national cham
pionship. A glance at the record is
sufficient to show this. Navy, con
prid fans have been looking forward
to for weeks. Undoubtedly the most
important in the nation this year, it
will probably decide the mythical
national championship. A glance at
the record is sufficient to show this.
Navy, conceded before the season to
be the best team in the country,
promptly dropped two out of its first
three games. The comparative yard
age, first downs, punting, etc., how
ever, show Navy to have been at a
distinct advantage. These two up
sets did not prevent sportswriters
throughout the country, whose in
vestigation of past games goes con
siderably deeper than the final score,
from ranking Navy second only to
Army in grid ratings of all teams.
The Middies have lost no games since

and figure a good chance against the
Cadets.
Army Record
The mighty Army machine has
rolled on undefeated and virtually
unopposed throughout the season.
Every game has been won by a lop
sided score, which is the main factor
in making the Cadets 10-6 favorites
over Navy. Experts say it will be
Army's backfield vs. Navy's line. It
is interesting to note that on the all
eastem team picked yesterday, there
were only two men on the lineup
who were not from Army or Navy.
The line was predominantly Navy,
while the backfield was pretty well
cornered by Davis, Kenna, Blanchard
& Co., of the Army.
In this game there is always a
psychological factor to be considered
If Army scores early it may be a
walkaway, while if the Middies draw
first blood Army will be lucky to
win by more than one touchdown.
But don't underestimate the Navy.
It will take the best Army team in
history to beat them, as Middy Coach
Oscar Hagberg commented yester
day.
Tech-Georgia
Georgia Tech over Georgia by 10.
The Engineers are in a different class
this year, having played against the
toughest opposition in the east and
done well. They upset Navy, 17 to 15,
early in the season, while the Bull
dogs have gone through a mediocre
season against minor-league oppo
nents.
Notre Dame over Great Lakes by 6.
The Irish are hot after upsetting
Georgia Tech and are out to avenge
that humiliating 19-14 defeat of last
year. True, it is not by any means the
same Notre Dame squad that saw an

undefeated season virtually stolen
from its grasp, but it is not the same
Sailor team that did the stealing,
either. A good game, regardless.
TCU-SMU
TCU over SMU by 7. The big game
always draws plenty of thrills, re
gardless of the standings of the
teams. Look for anything to hap
pen. Whether or not the Horned
Frogs are already crowned cham
pions of the southwest conference,
the Methodists will give them a
mighty rough fight.
Texas A & M over Texas by 1.
Have a horrible suspicion that (his
game is being played as I write this,
but what the hell, it fills space. An
exact analysis of the experts' opinion
on this game will show what a pip it
really is. Adams and Cohen each
took Texas by 1, while Gugel took
the Aggies by 1 and Levy took 'em
by 2. One-half a point threw the
prediction in favor of A & M. Gen
erally one of the nation's best games.
Broadcast
For the benefit of those rabid grid
fans on campus, the Army-Navy
game will be broadcast, probably
over KPO. beginning at 11 a.m. Pa
cific Wartime on Saturday. Tune in
for the game of the century.
