# Arguello To Meet Company C In Men's Intramural Playoffs
## 
### MORT COHEN 
The ball went back to Heald. He
faded and then shot a long spiral to
Dave Brown. It looked like a touch
down, but a Co. C man jumped into
the air and knocked it down. The
referee's whistle blew, and the game
was over; Med 111 had beaten Co. C,
19-18. Some of the spectators were
happy, others sad, but Coach Bugge,
acting head of intramurals, was hap
piest of all, for the season was now
over, except for the play-ofY between
Arguello, League II leaders, and Co.
C, champion of League I.
Co. C's margin of victory was
small. They had lost one game,
while Med 111 had lost one and tied
one. But the percentage scores gave
the crown to Co. C, and Coach
Bugge decided to base his decision
on that, instead of having a play
ofY of the tie game between Med. I
and Med. 111, which he felt would be
unfair although all concerned were
willing.
Fireworks Start
But to get back to the main at
traction of yesterday, the Med. 11l -
Co. C struggle. One thing that all
the spectators there will admit is
that it was one of the hardest fought
games of the year. Dave Brown,
Jackie Heald and Co. were leading
19-6 going into the fourth quarter
on an interception by Bill Homback
and two touchdown passes from the
fingers of Heald. And then the fire
works started. Bob Stolter took a
lateral and made a touchdown to
bring the score to 19-12, with four
minutes left. In the next series of
downs, Heald dropped back to punt,
but Pete Elliot raced through the
defense to block it, and Gordy Piles
pickcd the rolling ball up and
scooted over for a touchdown. The
score was 19-18, with only a few
minutes left. The pass for the extra
point was no good, and the game
ended.
In the other feature game of
League I, the Buchanan Bearcats
came through to dump Med. I. The
margin of victory was on a beauti-

I I'ul pass from Don Prince to Bud
Richter, Buchanan's star back.
Richter took the ball over his shoul
der and stepped over for the win
! ning tally. In the only other game
â–  played in League I.the Toyon Op
-1 erators and the Sequoia Roughs
fought to a 13-13 deadlock.
Arguello Dumped
Although the Gerona boys had no
| chance of taking first place, they
I "saved face" by beating previously
1 undefeated Arguello A.C., 14-13.
Bob Rosburg pitched touchdown
passes to Lee and Forbes. Forbes
also made the two conversions,
which ultimately decided the win
ner, from passes by Ro.sburg. Jimmy
Bradshaw, captain of Arguello,
played his usual great game. Twice,
on quarterback sneaks, he streaked
half the length of the field for the
two Arguello touchdowns.
Firehouse finally came through to
hand Washington a 24-0 spanking.
Washington was never in the game.
! In the only other game, Med. II took
j the measure of the Hashers by a 15-6
| margin.
