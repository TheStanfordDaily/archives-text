## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
Outlining in broad form his hopes
for the Stanford of the postwar
world. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder.
president of the University, spoke
before a record audience at this
quarter's first meeting of the Stan
lord Faculty Research Club in the
Men's Faculty Clubhouse last night.
Introduced by the Research Club
president, Dr. C. N. Reynolds, Dr.
Tresidder stressed the importance of
the need ioi top-notch men in every
field of endeavor, adding that he did
not know of any such field which to
day is not suffering under a shortage
of experienced men.
"I emphasize this fact," he said,
"because there is no profession that
is easier to scuttle in time of war
than the teaching profession. This
is of tremendous importance when
today the need for highly trained
men is greater than ever before."
Teacher Shortage
He said that he had not fully real
ized the tremendous burden this
shortage of good teachers placed on
the shoulders of those who were left
in the universities to carry on. "But,"'
he added, "my first quarter with the
Army made a Christian of me. I
came to understand that no man can
teach overtime and then be expected
to have any imagination or enthusi
asm for his work."
In developing this point. Dr. Tres
idder later said that his hopes for a
future Stanford included (1) com
plete leisure for the professors and

I the students; (2) strict selection o?
j tup-notch students, "for," he said,
| "there is nothing more discouraging
j to a good professor teaching in u
| good university than to have tj
| teach to students of only C grade
i average"; and (3) he announced that
} he would not be sorry to see sum-
I mer quarter a completely vacation
i quarter as it was before the war.
Period of Freedom
This last point he included as an
| important period of freedom from
| the pressure of teaching, when pro
i lessors could have time of their own
to spend on their own brand of study,
research and thought, to rekindle
their enthusiasm for their work.
The need for fresh, young minds
j in research work was emphasized by
i Dr. Tresidder, when he pointed out
j the huge expansion in that field im
minent in the postwar world,
j "Science and medicine cannot afford
j to get in a rut," he said, adding' that
[ these fields will be ever calling on
' related fields of scientific endeavor
I to help in united research.
Research Task Force
j "We need a research task force
! composed of all the sciences, to set
j up plans to conquer the great scien
j tific problems of our day, particularly
in the case of disease, he stated."
I expressing the hope that postwar
I Stanford, with a top-notch faculty
j instructing students of top-notch
; minds, would spare nothing to help
I in the achievement of these lofty
aims.
