# Peggy Fitts Directs This Year's Gaieties
## 
### MARION MORROW 
Her name is Peggy Fitts and she's
a Stanford woman. She began her
job as director of the 1944 Stanford
"Gaieties" way last summer—think
ing up and discarding idea after
idea that would make this "Gaieties"
the best ever —and finally settling
a foundation for a varied, charming
evening of entertainment.
People warned the Daily before
Peggy Fitts was interviewed that she
was a hard person to find this quar
ter. After several hours' patient
search .she was found backstage of
Memorial Theater (where uie "Gaie
ties" are being presented) glaring at
the light switches.
The Interview
It took a little waiting, but finally
she had a minute when she could
come out into the lobby to talk shop.
'This quarter," she said, "has been
all 'Gaieties'." She continued, '"And
it's been wonderful.
Peggy was graduated from high
school in Los Angeles, which is her
home. Her major at Stanford Ls
dramatics; her minor journalism, and
she is a first-quarter senior. After
she finishes college she would like
to write movie scenarios.
Past Dramatic Work
She was assistant director of the
last Spring show, and has acted in
Stanford plays since she was a fresh
man: "Wookey," "Squaring the
World," "Moor Born," "Young Man
of Tomorrow." She is versatile, and
has done ingenues, light comedy,
tragedy. She has also taken part in
three Spring shows and one other

: "Gaieties."
As a member 01" Ram's Head (the
j honorary dramatic society) she was
' eligible for election as director of
; this quarter's "Gaieties" when the
! elections were held last spring.
Her Election
When she was elected she and her
assistants started planning immedi
i ately. Actually, besides directing the
j show, she has written the opener and
' the finale, the "Libe skit," and has
! collaborated on the "Pit skit" and
the "House skit."
Then at the beginning of this quar
ter she thought they wouldn't be
able to have a "Gaieties" at all since
the Thanksgiving date conflicted
1 with the weekend planned. Finally,
however, they were able to postpone
the date a week. Despite the fact
that the Ballet Russe had the theater
the night before the dress rehearsal,
which necessitated the removal of
all "Gaiety" material, the show
went on.
Experiences like that happened all
the way through the rehearsing,
which began about October 30. Peggy
cautions all attenders of the show to-
I night and tomorrow to watch Willie
j Davies. and also to watch every face
j in the "Libe skit" as there'll be a
i surprise.
j "Thanks" Ottered
Peggy would like to thank every
! one for their cooperation — Jackie
1 Herr for his musical direction; Bob
! Payne, arrangements, and all the
others. Claude Wilson, musical di
rector of last year's show and author
i of several national hits, has given the
! "Gaieties" exclusive use of his iat
-1 est song, "I've Got So Much to For
-1 get."
Peggy added, "I think on the whole
the show has shaped up very well,
J and I'm looking forward to a good
opening night."
j Confusion
At this point in the interview, five
' people dashed into the lobby and
grabbed her by the hand, asking
j questions madly
j "When are we having dinner?" .. .
j "What's happened to the 'Boogie'
! number?" . . . etc.

Her name is Peggy Fitts and she's
a Stanford woman. She began her
job as director of the 1944 Stanford
"Gaieties" way last summer—think
ing up and discarding idea after
idea that would make this "Gaieties"
the best ever —and finally settling
a foundation for a varied, charming
evening of entertainment.
People warned the Daily before
Peggy Fitts was interviewed that she
was a hard person to find this quar
ter. After several hours' patient
search .she was found backstage of
Memorial Theater (where uie "Gaie
ties" are being presented) glaring at
the light switches.
The Interview
It took a little waiting, but finally
she had a minute when she could
come out into the lobby to talk shop.
'This quarter," she said, "has been
all 'Gaieties'." She continued, '"And
it's been wonderful.
Peggy was graduated from high
school in Los Angeles, which is her
home. Her major at Stanford Ls
dramatics; her minor journalism, and
she is a first-quarter senior. After
she finishes college she would like
to write movie scenarios.
Past Dramatic Work
She was assistant director of the
last Spring show, and has acted in
Stanford plays since she was a fresh
man: "Wookey," "Squaring the
World," "Moor Born," "Young Man
of Tomorrow." She is versatile, and
has done ingenues, light comedy,
tragedy. She has also taken part in
three Spring shows and one other

: "Gaieties."
As a member 01" Ram's Head (the
j honorary dramatic society) she was
' eligible for election as director of
; this quarter's "Gaieties" when the
! elections were held last spring.
Her Election
When she was elected she and her
assistants started planning immedi
i ately. Actually, besides directing the
j show, she has written the opener and
' the finale, the "Libe skit," and has
! collaborated on the "Pit skit" and
the "House skit."
Then at the beginning of this quar
ter she thought they wouldn't be
able to have a "Gaieties" at all since
the Thanksgiving date conflicted
1 with the weekend planned. Finally,
however, they were able to postpone
the date a week. Despite the fact
that the Ballet Russe had the theater
the night before the dress rehearsal,
which necessitated the removal of
all "Gaiety" material, the show
went on.
Experiences like that happened all
the way through the rehearsing,
which began about October 30. Peggy
cautions all attenders of the show to-
I night and tomorrow to watch Willie
j Davies. and also to watch every face
j in the "Libe skit" as there'll be a
i surprise.
