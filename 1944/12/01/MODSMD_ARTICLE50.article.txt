Thanksgiving is over and for that i
| we give thanks! Not that we don't i
j like Thanksgiving—it's just that no :
1 holiday can replace women and they
j were noticeably absent last weekend. I

Encina is moving again! We orig
inally lived on the fifth floor, moved
i down to the fourth, and are now
moving down to the third. If we
i keep going down and down someone
I will undoubtedly draw a comparison
between Dante's seven stages and
the fact that by these various moves
we are getting closer and closer to
j the orderly room. In fact, we have
j moved so many times lately that it
i has been rumored that General
Marshall has been released for active
duty by a YVAC!

This week the medical interviews,
jto determine the advisability of
| sending pre-meds on to med school,
l were given. After the interviewing
| was over and the questioning was
I over and the rehashing was over, it
j developed that these were some of i
: the THOUGHTS men had in re- <
i sponse to various questions.
Question: Suppose a miracle were ;
; to happen, the war were to end, you
j get a discharge, and your uncle
j leaves you a million dollars—would
! you enter the medical profession?
Answer: I would invest the million
I dollars in war bonds and live off the
interest.
Question: How often do you go out
j with girls?
Answer: Not as often as I would
: like.
I Question: Why are your grades so
j low?
Answer: They grade us on the .
, curve. SOMEONE has to make the
i low grades.
Question: Do you like the army? j
Answer: Are you kidding?
Then there was the bright fellow
j who thought of asking the board,
' "And what makes you think you are
qualified to tell me whether I am
i qualified to go to med school or not?" j

Thrown in my transom the other
! day, closely followed by a brick, was
a six-page essay on how I have slan
dered the character of the entire
j ERC. The final paragraph ran thus
j ly: Let me say in conclusion, that ,
. 1 although the EEC's cannot hide
! those big, yellow shoulder patches, it
is a well-known fact around Encina
that the pre-meds constantly wear
j their hats to cover up a patch of one
j sort or another. Signed by Mike Mc
| Elrath and 139 other privates.
Tickets are now definitely on sale I
I for the Snow B;ill at the ASSU of

! from your house president or secre- i
| tary.

Tonight is the night of the Gaieties
j and at least Johnny High promises
! to be hilarious. When last seen he
i was at the corner of the Quad order-
I ing three dozen tickets (55-centers).
j Most any time you can see him ad
i miring his photograph that is posted
I at the corner near the sales booth.
Besides this Highlarious character,
the Gl's have some interest in the
program, as Jackie Herr is musical
director, Bob Payne is arranger and
Danny Hughes has written one of the
numbers to be tused in the show. The
Army band' singer, Leslie Alexan-'
! der, has also written quite a few
j songs for the program.

Mike Donahue, the lucky stiff, is
leaving today for the University of
Penn., where he will continue his
; work in pre-med. The luck of the
Irish continues!
