### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. â€” Mam
moth American superfortresses, at
tacking Toyko for the fourth time in
six elapsed days, hurled hundreds of
tons of bombs on the sprawling
Mushashina aircraft works today and
left big fires, whipped by a gale
like wind, raging behind them.
Twelve of a fleet of Japanese fight
ing planes which rose in an attempt
to head off the raiders, were de
stroyed or damaged seriously and
one of the B-29's was lost to fighter
action.
For ninety minutes, according to
Japanese admission, the superforts
attacked Tokyo in waves, flying at
levels up to more than six miles high.
