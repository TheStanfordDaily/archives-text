# Bond Auction Set Pearl Harbor Day
## 
### 
As the Sixth War Loan Drive
swings into high gear, campus lead
ers are preparing a climactic all
campus auction Thursday in the Nit
ery as part of Stanford's commemo
ration of Pearl Harbor Day. Emcee
and auctioneer will be Johnny High,
fresh from his Gaieties triumph.
Charlie Clark, heading plans for
the auction, believes it will provide
the necessary incentive for achieve
ment of Stanford's bond quota.
Returning to the spotlight after a
year of campus accidents and ad
ventures, the "D. G.-Monroe Hall
Dogemobile" will once again be of
fered to auction enthusiasts. A fight -
-to-the-finish contest between Chi
O's and the DG's, plus the plotting
and ingenuity of the Monroe men
netted last year's bond drive $32,000.
Mary Lou Patton, heading the
Things-to-Auction department, has
garnered Kleenex and a carton of
cigarettes (compliments of the Union
store) and is trying to get more of
the articles boycotted by war to
stimulate bidding.
Dates with BMOC's and BWOC's.
offered in the friendly Farm spirit,
will also be offered. Dick Fay ram is
arranging for hotel dinner - dance
bids.
