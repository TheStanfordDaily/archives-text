# STAGNANT APES

"The genuine pedigree of man is an ascent
from the chattering, swarming tribes of sim
ians, ever inguisitive, ever examining and in
venting, whose only fall was from a tree-top, in
the course of a*voyage of perilous but splendid
discovery; and the only bad ape is the stagnant,
incurious ape." So says Osbert Sitwell in a
novel, Before the Bombardment.
Now far be it from us to call Stanford students
a swarming tribe of stagnant apes, but never
theless there is a moral in that brief guotation
which Stanford students might do well to con
sider.
Stanford students should make a voyage of
perilous but splendid discovery, for the only
fall we would have would be from our Ivory
Tower. Think of it, instead of having our pres
ent concern with intercollegiate athletics, sere
nades from Seguoia, and beer at—oh, well, any
number of places —we might be known as
a group of people ever inguisitive, ever exam
ining and inventing.
In fact, we might even be known as people
who backed the Sixth War Loan, contributed to
the Blood Bank, and achieved our birthright to
a genuine pedigree.
