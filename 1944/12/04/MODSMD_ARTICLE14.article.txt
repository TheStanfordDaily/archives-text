# YOURS IS THE PRIVILEGE

Do you remember as a kid how it was the
present you gave someone else and not the
one you got yourself that was the real thrill at
Christmas? No matter how badly you wanted
the bicycle or the football or whatever it was,
the thing you waited for was the moment when
your mother opened the 75-cent bottle of per
fume that you had hung over a counter for an
hour deciding to buy.
Just now we've got a chance to do much the
same thing. We've got a chance to give a rec
ord or a book that we know is good to some
body we know will like it—the hospitalized
G.l.'s in this area.
But remember, no matter how much he en
joys the record of the book, no matter how much
he wanted it, he'll never get as much fun out
of receiving it as you did giving it. Yours is
the privilege.—-Nancy Tilden
