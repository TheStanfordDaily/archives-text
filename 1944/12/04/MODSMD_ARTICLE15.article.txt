# Bull Session

### Dick Crane 
Some people are now saying, "Only so many
more days until Christmas," but I am saying,

"Only five more days for writing this column.
I have completely run out of ideas. It is too
much to try to be humorous any more. I have
practically run out of ideas, and do so with a
happy thought: I go back into literary oblivion.
The happy little statistical moron, who writes
a column for the Daily known as "Our Hasher
Sez," finally tired of writing of deaths, mar
riages, births, and put something worth while
in his column of last week.
In his little bit of hearsay, he plugged for the
-eturn of intercollegiate athletics, and to get in
ho "swing of things" by starting off the season
vith basketball. After a few sessions with the
administration officials, most of the people
v anting the return of Stanford "Red" were
convinced of the unwiseness of intercollegiate
athletics at this time. Everyone is talking about

this topic, without doing much thinking, and
so your old Bull Sessioner will do his little bit
to try to clarify the situation.
People will no doubt "boo!" me as I walk
down Quad, but after thinking the whole situ
ation over, here is just what I think in regard
to the return of collegiate competition at this
time.
I sincerely do not think the time is here, or
will be here for a long time, when we can have
athletics here in the wonderful, profitable v/ay
of former years. Some rah! rah! students say,
"What do we care whether we win or lose, just
as long as we have a team?" That kind are usu
ally the loudest wailers, and the poorest back
ers when a losing team is present. We cannot
field a winning team in anything, or even a
good team, as long as other schools that com
pete against us can use Navy and Marine train
ees, so why not be smart and wait a little while?
If we had a larger enrollment of students, per
haps we could get together a fair civilian team
in comparison with Cal or U.S.C. or other
schools heavily endowed with students, but it's
common knowledge that we don't have the en
rollment, so let's be calm and sane about the
whole thing.
The war also doesn't provide too much stim
ulus aiding our return to former days of the
"Big Red." In regard to the transportation prob
lem, which happens to be a major issue in this
controversy, the tie-up will undoubtedly be
worse as the tempo of conflict in the Pacific will
increase with time.
All in all, I don't think the whole idea is a
good one at this time, and I for one am against
any more agitation for intercollegiate athletics
until an appropriate time has arrived. That's my
thought for today.
