To the Editor:
Walking down the Quad yesterday, I heard
one Stanford woman say to another:
"Are you going to buy a bond for the Sixth
War Loan?"
"Why, no," answered the girl. "I've already
bought my 52.50 worth of stamps for the quar
ter!"
Do you realize how little we are actually giv
ing to the war? Twenty-five cents a week, that's
all that's asked of us, besides two hours of war
work. When you think how much we should
want to give, it hurts.
A War Loan is our chance for an extra in
vestment. We ought to squeeze every penny
we can into buying additional stamps and, even
more important, bonds.
Yes, the ol' excuse is, "I'm broke; the quar
ter's nearly over." Yet is anyone cutting down
on trips to the Cellar, shows in Paly, plays in
the City?
What if one of our soldiers, having put away
two Japs, said, "Well, I've done my quota; I'm
quitting."
I refer anyone who doesn't know there is a
war going on to Tuesday's Bull Session. No
words can describe the situation more per
fectly.
The toughest part is yet to come—and we
will hardly feel it—but we can do our part to
help it! Carol Hurwitz

Dear Sir:
We feel the organization behind the
Sixth War Loan Drive has fallen below every
previous standard. It lacks fire, initiative, and
spirit.
Even though competitive spirit is lacking be
tween Cal and Stanford, the competition be
tween nations has not ceased.
It is up to us to lend our support to this drive,
and it is our responsibility as much as that of
our parents' to support it.
Speaking for Roble we are willing to enter in
competition with any living group to encourage
interest in buying bonds.
Sincerely, Joyce Costello (for Roble Sponsors)
