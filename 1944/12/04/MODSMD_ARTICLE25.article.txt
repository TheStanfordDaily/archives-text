### MARY AL SMITH 
NOW PLAYING AT THE STAN
FORD BOOKSTORE — Try and Stop
Me, for which Bennett (I always call
him Bennett) Cerf has edited anec
dotes, some anemic and some a
knockout, which well-known per
sonalities have palmed off as their
own.
Although probably unaware of it,
the author has collected several

items which are of special interest
to the Stanford student who is hav
ing trouble in his major field.
Yes, there is hope for the Drahma
majors when we learn that a script
once began with these lines: Time of
Act I: 7,000 years ago. Act II: one
day later.
P. E. people, did you ever hear
the one about the man who came
back to the practice tee so visibly
unnerved that his friend rushed out
of the locker room to see what was
wrong. "What's wrong?" was the
bitter retort. "I just killed my wife;
that's what wrong. I was just out
there practising, and didn't see my
wife come up behind me. I took a
i back swing, hit her on the head—
and she dropped dead." "Gee, that's
too bad. What club were you using?"
"A niblick." mourned the golfer.
"That the right club to use!" said
his friend happily.
Here is a tip for business majors
from the 1936 world's champion hog
caller: "You've got to have appeal as
well as power in your voice. You've
got to convince the hogs that you
have something for them."
This remark overheard in a lobby
should tickle the antenna of radio
listeners — Saroyan isn't his real
name, you know. It's a pseudonym.
Saroyan is NATURE'S spelled back
wards."
Try this for sighs: Robert Bcnch
j ley was caught in a thunderstorm
! one afternoon and came home soaked
i to the skin. "George," he called to
his servant, "get me out of these wet
clothes and into a dry martini."
"Conspicuous by its absence" is a
personal favorite which concern a
certain Hollywood pioducer, who is
! undoubtedly credited with mary re
j marks of Howard Dietz or Jock Law
rence origin but of whom the fol
j lowing is nevertheless true.
