### Elliot Epsteen 
Earlier during the present ofTen- i
sive on the Siegfried Line front, the j
Allied plan became somewhat appar
ent. Now the manner in which the I
Germans will play their cards is
becoming evident, and it is good— |
much too good.
The fine Prussian hand of Field- !
Marshal Gerd von Runstedt can be
seen behind the German moves.
France and the early days of the
Russian war showed him very ex- j
cellenl as an attacker, but the way j
the German defensive plan seemed I
to be shaping up in Normandy be- |
fore his removal, and the present
battle of the Siegfried Line demon- j
strates him to be a past-master at ;
the art of the defensive.

| There is one salient factor that
j seems to shape the German strategy.
1 A breakthrough across the Rhine,
either in Holland or from the Aachen
' salient would be lethal to their re
i sistance as the Allies would be on
! flat, open country and could employ
j armored forces for one great lunge
j all the way to Berlin.
On the other hand, a breakthrough
in the area of the Saar would chan
nel an Allied advance between the
Main and the Danube into the difli
! cult province of Saxony, and might
! be stopped. One in the extreme south
I would then have to clear the moun
-1 tains and forests of Baden and would
I probably lose its momentum.
Dispositions
Thus von Runstedt put his major
weight in the north, left the Saar
front heavily defended but not quite
as much so as the more northern sec
tors, and put his light force in the
south. The Allied forces started to
plunge all along the line with their
! main power in the north, but this
] met von Runstedt's heaviest concen

i tiger tanks.
i The Allied offensive in the north
| is going sour because of it. Some
| where in this country something
| went wrong, and shell production
j dropped off so much that vital artil
: lery ammunition has to be rationed
j out in the front lines. This has some
| thing to do with it. Von Runstedt
| was clever enough to know where to
' wait, and this also is important. Any

j through a range of hills and finally
j seize the bridgeheads on the Rhino
I and cross over.
Our progress is not upsetting Von
j Runstedt in the least because it is
J too slow. He hopes to wear us down
] like a thick mound of earth wears
i down the velocity of a rifle bullet
I trying to slice throught it. His tac

j in depth, show this. He seems to be
