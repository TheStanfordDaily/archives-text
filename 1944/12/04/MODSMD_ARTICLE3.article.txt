### 
Dr. Max Radin. distinguished pro
fessor of law at the University of
California, will speak on ''War Crim
inals" tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in the
auditorium of Memorial Hall at
Stanford.
What punishment is feasible for
Nazi war criminals? This is one of
the questions which Professor Radin
will answer in his lecture.
Dr. Radin believes that a special
international tribunal must be cre
ated for the trial of war criminals.
There are many difficulties to be
considered, however, if such trials
are to be conducted on a level higher
than "lynch law," he says.
The lecture tomorrow night is one
of the regular Tuesday Evening
Series of events which are presented
while the University is in session.
The programs are open to the public
without admission charge, and they
are sponsored by the University
Committee on Public Exercises.
