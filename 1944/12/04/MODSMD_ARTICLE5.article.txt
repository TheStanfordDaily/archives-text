"Is Life Worth Living?" Lennox
Robinson's delightful comedy of high
drama and simple folk will be pro
duced for a five-night run starting
| this Wednesday in the Little Theater
by the Stanford Players. This is the
second production of the season by
the Players, and is being directed by
Norman Philbrick.
Sally Stocker, well-known drama
major, plays the part of Constance
Constancia and, sacrificing all for
art, is dyeing her blonde tresses a
brilliant red for the production.
George Crane, author of the sum
mer's Bull Session in the Daily, plays
opposite her as Walter de la Mare,
j and together they form an impecu
! nious stock company which travels
| around presenting the loftier forms
of the theater as exemplified by pro
found Russian and Scandinavian
playwrights.
Martin Nalder is cast as Mr. John
Twohig, who is guilty of bringing
the earnest thespians to the Irish
seaside resort.
