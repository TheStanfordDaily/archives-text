# Midnight Coronation of King To Highlight Army's Snow Ball
## 
### MIKE SULAK 
Despite war conditions, the rough
campus shortage of Roughs, and
everything that goes with that,
feminine hearts will have an oppor
tunity to beat again at this Satur
day night's Snow Ball, rolled and
tossed by Stanford's G. I. incumbents
of Encina. Making their biggest so
cial bid of the quarter, they are cap
ping a gala affair with the night's
highlighted coronation of a ''Snow
King"—as chosen by popular ballot
ing by those present at the Pavilion
on that evening.
Due to Stanford rules regarding
the choice of an all-campus Queen
(an emphatic negative), the Army
Snow Ball Committee struck upon
the idea of an all-campus King in
stead, and somewhat paralleling the
famous Dartmouth College annual
snow carnival festivities, Stanford's
monarch will be surrounded by a
court of 16 Snow Belles. Given the
green light by Women's Conference
to choose its own campus beauties,
the Army has already hand-picked
its Belles, following careful selec
tion from a bountiful crop.
With the coordination of several
appointed committees, preparations
for the dance have been finally com
pleted after.much effort and weeks

I of planning by combined "A" and
I "C" Company personnel.
Music by Dick Tauber's Shoe
maker Field Band, featured last year
j at the Hellzapoppin' dance, will keep
i the Pavilion alternately romantic
and rocking with their sweet and hot
| music from 9 to 1.
| Decorations will deck the floor
j with streamers, Christmas trees,
; mistletoe and other wintertime ac
! cessories, in additions to a Royal
, Throne for the Snow King—all the
| handiwork of a committee headed by
| Pete Long, Jim Gibbs and Herman
Hansen.
Ted Farrell, in charge of Kii\g and
j Court, states that each ticket pur
; chased entitles each Rough and
| Smooth to a vote for King, and bal
| lot smay be placed in any of the nu
j merous ballot boxes scattered around
the dance floor. All votes must be in
| by 11 p.m. to enable the tabulation,
i and the climatic midnight coronation
[ ceremonies. Farrell adds that any
i student on campus is eligible for the
| crown and sceptre. Ken Hodge,
j heading "Sponsors and Chaperones,"
| announces a handsome gift for the
: King.
The dance is definitely semi-form
al, and a limited number of tickets
are on sale at the ASSU office. The
price is Si.so and they are going fast.

Ted Farrell, in charge of Kii\g and

i and the climatic midnight coronation
[ ceremonies. Farrell adds that any
i student on campus is eligible for the

j heading "Sponsors and Chaperones,"

: King.
The dance is definitely semi-form
al, and a limited number of tickets
are on sale at the ASSU office. The
price is Si.so and they are going fast.
Despite war conditions, the rough
campus shortage of Roughs, and
everything that goes with that,
feminine hearts will have an oppor
tunity to beat again at this Satur
day night's Snow Ball, rolled and
tossed by Stanford's G. I. incumbents
of Encina. Making their biggest so
cial bid of the quarter, they are cap
ping a gala affair with the night's
highlighted coronation of a ''Snow
King"—as chosen by popular ballot
ing by those present at the Pavilion
on that evening.
Due to Stanford rules regarding
the choice of an all-campus Queen
(an emphatic negative), the Army
Snow Ball Committee struck upon
the idea of an all-campus King in
stead, and somewhat paralleling the
famous Dartmouth College annual
snow carnival festivities, Stanford's
monarch will be surrounded by a
court of 16 Snow Belles. Given the
green light by Women's Conference
to choose its own campus beauties,
the Army has already hand-picked
its Belles, following careful selec
tion from a bountiful crop.
With the coordination of several
appointed committees, preparations
for the dance have been finally com
pleted after.much effort and weeks

I of planning by combined "A" and
I "C" Company personnel.

maker Field Band, featured last year
