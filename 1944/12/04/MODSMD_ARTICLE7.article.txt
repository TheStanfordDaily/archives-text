# GAIETIES REVIEW
## Success Rests on Fitts, Levinson. High 
### DICK BOWER 
Any success that the 1944 edition
of the Gaieties acquires rests upon
the magnetism and momentum of
its three mainstays — Peggy Fitts.
Jean Levinson and Johnny High
For it was by their bubbling exu~
berance that the Gaieties was
raised above the level of high
school entertainment.
A near - capacity house awaited
Friday night's first curtain, which
produced plenty of uncomfortable
moments for the restless stub-hold
ers. The opening number was a sad
little ditty bearing the title, "This
Time," which found the entire com
pany sprawled in various positions
over the stage.
Following an extremely awk
ward ballet and an uninspiring
tune appropriately titled "If I
Could Only Write a Song," the
first skit of the evening. "Joe On
The Row,' was presented to an
enthusiastic audience. Numerous
prwfaMe expressions aud the pres

ence of Mary Lou Patten in a
towel will be long remembered by
some Stanfordites.
Johnny High's first specialty, to
gether with a group of old Gaieties
songs, were the only redeeming fea
tures of a jerky and mechanically
imperfect first half which hit a piti
ful low in an obscene skit concern
ing the barbecue grounds. Whoever
was responsible for the latter item
needs a few lessons in good taste.
The second portion of the show
found a market improvement pres
ent, especially in the nostalgic
Fitts - Levinson duo, which pro
vided the evening's most enjoyable
moments for this reviewer.
The feature skit, "Time of Your
Libe," was concerned with the pos
sibilities of acquiring beer for the
library. It was far too lengthy and
much of the dialogue went unheard
by most of the audience. Only
Johnny High's penetrating voice
boomed to the vast recesses of the
upper balcony where thU reviewer
was perched.

i Other acts in the second stanza
included an accomplished magic
! show by Doug Dulac; the voices of
Jackie Cannon and Bob Gettys in
j "Reminiscing," sung against a
striking background that placed
j the scene's locale in this state:
, Johnny High again in his presen
< tation of a one-man opera; and
the excellent voice of Herb Wilson
as he swooned Claude Wilson's
"I ve Got So Much to Forget."
The musical accompaniment show
ed little practice, due no doubt to
necessary Army regulations. But
| there was little excuse for the glaring
I technical miscues committed thru
out the show.
Rain's Head is certainly not to be
i condemned for this year s Gaie
ties—it is probably the natural re
sult of present-day conditions. In -
i stead, we should be ({lad that this
integral part of Stanford life has
continued — and none of us will
ever forget Peggy Fitts and Jean
I a'vinsou with their "It's been a
hell of a long time."

school entertainment.
A near - capacity house awaited
Friday night's first curtain, which
produced plenty of uncomfortable
moments for the restless stub-hold
ers. The opening number was a sad
little ditty bearing the title, "This
Time," which found the entire com
pany sprawled in various positions
over the stage.
Following an extremely awk
ward ballet and an uninspiring
tune appropriately titled "If I
Could Only Write a Song," the
first skit of the evening. "Joe On
The Row,' was presented to an
enthusiastic audience. Numerous
prwfaMe expressions aud the pres

ence of Mary Lou Patten in a
towel will be long remembered by
some Stanfordites.
Johnny High's first specialty, to
gether with a group of old Gaieties
songs, were the only redeeming fea
tures of a jerky and mechanically
imperfect first half which hit a piti
ful low in an obscene skit concern
ing the barbecue grounds. Whoever
was responsible for the latter item
needs a few lessons in good taste.
The second portion of the show
found a market improvement pres
ent, especially in the nostalgic
Fitts - Levinson duo, which pro
vided the evening's most enjoyable
moments for this reviewer.
The feature skit, "Time of Your
Libe," was concerned with the pos
sibilities of acquiring beer for the
library. It was far too lengthy and
much of the dialogue went unheard
by most of the audience. Only
Johnny High's penetrating voice
boomed to the vast recesses of the
upper balcony where thU reviewer
was perched.

i Other acts in the second stanza
included an accomplished magic
! show by Doug Dulac; the voices of
Jackie Cannon and Bob Gettys in
j "Reminiscing," sung against a
striking background that placed
j the scene's locale in this state:
, Johnny High again in his presen
< tation of a one-man opera; and
the excellent voice of Herb Wilson
as he swooned Claude Wilson's
"I ve Got So Much to Forget."
The musical accompaniment show
ed little practice, due no doubt to
necessary Army regulations. But
| there was little excuse for the glaring
I technical miscues committed thru
out the show.
Rain's Head is certainly not to be
i condemned for this year s Gaie
ties—it is probably the natural re
sult of present-day conditions. In -
i stead, we should be ({lad that this
integral part of Stanford life has
continued — and none of us will
ever forget Peggy Fitts and Jean
I a'vinsou with their "It's been a
hell of a long time."
Any success that the 1944 edition
of the Gaieties acquires rests upon
the magnetism and momentum of
its three mainstays — Peggy Fitts.
Jean Levinson and Johnny High
For it was by their bubbling exu~
berance that the Gaieties was
raised above the level of high
school entertainment.
