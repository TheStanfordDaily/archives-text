As we are so close to final examinations —
happy thought—l think it only appropriate to say
something about them. This could be for the
benefit of the old students who are going
through the horrible routine again, or perhaps
for the enlightenment of the first-guarter fresh
men who are now looking forward to them.
Ah yes, finals! — the scourge of mankind.
Everyone has some sort of finals before their
life be over, be it biology, art appreciation, sex
hygiene or civil service. This is the period in
life when everyone goes to work. Joe Sher
and the rest of the "in group" have even been
known to give up their favorite pastime, which
isn't studying.
Every time the end of the guarter approaches
I can't help but think of a cartoon that Chaparral
once ran in their filthy mag. It was a picture of
a "Rasputin of the Classroom," and with a test
tube of bacteria in one hand and a pencil and
classbook in the other, and he was musing to
himself, "I wonder what I can cook up for the
little bastards this time." Yes, dear students,
finals are the period of the guarter when the
profs get their revenge for lecturing to empty
classrooms; the time for them to get even for
all the times during the guarter that you
"beefed" about being robbed by the reader on
your exams. It's certainly a small way to look
at it, but you know how professors are about
those things.
It is a custom at Stanford to have a "dead
week," preceding finals week, but the ironic
part of the whole thing is the fact that dead
week really is the week after finals. The cus
toms here are sometimes very confusing, as you i
may have already ascertained.
A short dialogue during finals might go some
thing like this: "Dammit, man! Don't drink all
that coffee. How do you expect me to stay up
all night without a drink?" "What a life those
profs lead! All they do is sit on their fannies and
give us these tests. The worst part of it is they
don't even have to read them." (Dear Profs: j
That's what the dialogue says—not me!)
The whole dialogue is ended with the har
assed person saying, 'To hell with the course!
I would have flunked it anyhow, as the prof
has a grudge against me. Let's go have a beer."
After they are all over, your worries are over
too—for two weeks. They come and go, and
pretty soon you get that old B.A. degree, and
no more finals. All you have to worry about
'hen is finding a job.

There has been a lot of publicity given on the

proposed plan of giving presents of books and
records to G.l.'s for Christmas, and as much as
I can gather, the response is very good from the
gals around here, but the "roughs" have been
a little lax.
Perhaps some of you male civilians will be
wanting a book or record yourself next year
when you are in an army hospital. It's not a
pleasant thought, but you will have to admit
that it is a plausible one, so GIVE YOU GUYS.
