# Campus Opinion

### 
December 4, 1944.
The Editor, Sir:
We, who directed the 1944 Gaieties, want to
go on record against the brutal, incompetent,
and unfair review of Gaieties which the Daily
published yesterday morning. It is by far the
most uniformly and emphatically unfavorable
criticism ever accorded a student show on this
campus.
Whether the Gaieties this year was actually
the worst student show to date is no longer ours
to judge. But as Mr. Bower reserves the right
to state his opinion of it in print, we reserve the
right to object to his opinion, not only because
it is badly written, and not only because of what
we consider its injustice to the show itself and
to all the students, particularly those in the
Army, who gave so much of their time and
fort to it, but chiefly because we do not believe
that it is representative.
In the first place, it was specifically arranged
with the Daily that the show was to be reviewed
from Saturday's performance, which has never
yet failed to be a one hundred per cent im
provement over Friday's performance. The
Daily's complimentary tickets were for Saturday
night; we do not know who used them, but it
was obviously not Mr. Bower. Mr. Bower, it
seems, bought his own ticket, a 55-center to
judge from his comments, and this may have
been in part responsible for the negative vio
lence of his reaction.
In the second place, we respectfully ask for
a second review of the same show, to be writ
ten by anyone, with the exception of Mr. Bower,
the Daily wishes to name and published, if pos
sible, before the end of this quarter. We want
nobody to receive the impression that we- can't
take it. Wo are fully as aware of the show's
faults as anyone who saw it, Mr. Bower includ
ed. They can be only partially excused by war
time conditions, necessary limitations as to time
and space and personnel, and the advent of the
Ballet Russe the night before our final dress re
hearsal.
We welcome criticism from any quarter when
it is constructive or when it is honestly and
capably expressed. And we do not want any
sort of comment, favorable or otherwise, that
we have not deserved.
We are trying to find out where we stand.
Since Mr. Bower is plainly too sophisticated to
derive any entertainment, admittedly unskilled
but none the less hopeful and sincere, of his
fellow-students; too delicate to withstand the
rugged humor of student-written skits, and too
absorbed in adjective-hunting to take in a good
part of the show he was reviewing, we would
like to see the published opinion of another
critic who, perhaps, has a more thorough un
derstanding of what student shows are and
must be, at Stanford or anywhere else.
Ram's Head is not satisfied with merely not
being "condemned" for putting on a bad show
in wartime. It wants to know whether it actu
ally was that bad a show, and whether there is
enouyh student interest still alive to justify
such shows in the future. It is the campus that
makes the Gaieties. We would like to know
what the campus thinks.
Thank you, (Signed)

The Editor, Sir:
We, who directed the 1944 Gaieties, want to
go on record against the brutal, incompetent,
and unfair review of Gaieties which the Daily
published yesterday morning. It is by far the
most uniformly and emphatically unfavorable
criticism ever accorded a student show on this
campus.
Whether the Gaieties this year was actually
the worst student show to date is no longer ours
to judge. But as Mr. Bower reserves the right
to state his opinion of it in print, we reserve the
right to object to his opinion, not only because
it is badly written, and not only because of what
we consider its injustice to the show itself and
to all the students, particularly those in the
Army, who gave so much of their time and
fort to it, but chiefly because we do not believe
that it is representative.
In the first place, it was specifically arranged
with the Daily that the show was to be reviewed
from Saturday's performance, which has never
yet failed to be a one hundred per cent im
provement over Friday's performance. The
Daily's complimentary tickets were for Saturday
night; we do not know who used them, but it
was obviously not Mr. Bower. Mr. Bower, it
seems, bought his own ticket, a 55-center to
judge from his comments, and this may have
been in part responsible for the negative vio
lence of his reaction.
In the second place, we respectfully ask for
a second review of the same show, to be writ
ten by anyone, with the exception of Mr. Bower,
the Daily wishes to name and published, if pos
sible, before the end of this quarter. We want
nobody to receive the impression that we- can't
take it. Wo are fully as aware of the show's
faults as anyone who saw it, Mr. Bower includ
ed. They can be only partially excused by war
time conditions, necessary limitations as to time
and space and personnel, and the advent of the
Ballet Russe the night before our final dress re
hearsal.
We welcome criticism from any quarter when
it is constructive or when it is honestly and
capably expressed. And we do not want any
sort of comment, favorable or otherwise, that
we have not deserved.
We are trying to find out where we stand.
Since Mr. Bower is plainly too sophisticated to
derive any entertainment, admittedly unskilled
but none the less hopeful and sincere, of his
fellow-students; too delicate to withstand the
rugged humor of student-written skits, and too
absorbed in adjective-hunting to take in a good
part of the show he was reviewing, we would
like to see the published opinion of another
critic who, perhaps, has a more thorough un
derstanding of what student shows are and
must be, at Stanford or anywhere else.
