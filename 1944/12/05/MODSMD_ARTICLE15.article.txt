Willi the Snow Bali drawing closer
every day and a beautiful court se
lected by the Army men, the selec
tion of the King has settled down to
a small group. The withdrawal of
the "Phantom" from the race has
left the field wide open for his chief
opponent, John "Sigh" Saini. The
loss of the Phantom has saddened
his supporters but the camp
is jubilant and support for their can
didate has increased to a tremen
dous proportion.

Bob, "the little Injuns' poppa"
Bieer, is in the Palo Alto hospital
recovering from an appendicitis op
eration. Bieer is doing as well as
can be expected, for as yet he is too
weak to chase any of the nurses. The
first symptoms appeared in the usual
form but were dismissed as the usual
after-effects of a hard night of study.
It was only when they became severe
that the doctor was called. Upon
taking a blood count and separating
the blood from the reeb, it was dis
covered that the count was several

I million over the normal figure, and
i this poor pain-wracked lad was has
i tened to the hospital where lie can
now be found by his friends and
creditors.
