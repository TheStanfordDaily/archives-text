# Arguello Ready to Test Company ‘C’ in Playoff
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Two top rate grid teams, both
coming within a point of claiming
an undefeated season, will meet in
the intramural playoff this after
noon at 4:30 on the varsity prac
tice field. Company "C", winner of
League I and Arguello AA, title
holders in League 11, will clash for
football supremacy in what promises
to be the climax to an action-packed
season.
Company "C," sparked by the sen
sational pass - catching of Gordy
Pyles, employs a sizzling passing at
tack with Ted Farrell at the hurling
post. The soldiers also boast ter
rific lineman in Pete Elliot who got
through the Nu Sigma defense to
block a punt in last week's final
fray. The expert passing may be the
key to victory against the compara
tively weak Arguello aerial defense.
Arguello Has Speed
A mixture of passes and ground
gaining off a modified "T" formation
is what the Arguello lads will throw

j at the soldiers. Jim Bradshaw, Argu
! olio's high-scoring quarterback, will
I lead the attack with the patt-catch
ing fingers of Morley Thompson
counted on to work overtime. Joe
Pickering and Bob Abrams, moun
i tain linemen, are priming for an in
teresting afternoon in their oppo
nents' backfield.
Crowd Expected
Stanford students who have been
whining for some athletic competi
tion are invited to watch the pro
ceedings at no extra cost. Regulation
touch football rules will prevail, with
modifications used during the re
cent season. Coach Elwyn Bugge,
head of mural sports, announced that
expert officiating will be employed in
order to protect both teams from un
fair advantages.
'lhrce Games Today
Three postponed games are to be
played off this afternoon, according
to Bugge. In League I, Sequoia plays
Med. I on Field 2; in League 11, Fire
house meets Med. II on Field 3 and
