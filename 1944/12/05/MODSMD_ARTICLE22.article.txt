# Drama Opens Tomorrow
## 
### 
When a simple group of peaceful country folk take the teachings of the
serious dramatists to their bosoms and conduct their lives upon the fatal
istic philosophies they learn, something is bound to happen. Something
does happen tomorrow night in the Little Theater, when that situation
arises in Lennox Robinson's comedy of Irish folk under the spell of earnest

Thespians, "Is Life Worth Living?"
In the higher drama, such as Che
kov's "Lower Depths," the futility of
life is expounded by the De la Mare
Stock Company, composed princi
pally of Sally Stocker, blonde drama
major who is becoming a redhead
for the production, and George
Crane. ex-Bull Sessioner. Judged by
the exalted standards of greater crit
ics such as the Daily boasts, their
productions might be considered
melodramatic, even "hamniy!" But
the citizens ol Inish are fascinated
by the babies murdered in the cellar,
the mothers split by cleavers, and
other such assorted bloody crimes.
And no one can tell just why Inish
is treated to a sudden wave of crimes
and attempted homicides. Everyone
is baffled by the fact that, ever since
the Stocker-Crane combine began
showing people to each other as. the
creepy, crawling, nasty mistakes of
nature that they really are, everyone
in the neighborhood develops a hor
rible past and an even more dismal
future. .
The advent of the De la Mare play
ers is caused by Mr. John Twohig,
"big shot of Inish, who is disgusted
with the superficial musical shows
and circuses previously considered
proper entertainment for a seaside
resort. Mr. Twohig is played by
Martin Nalder.
Eddie Twohig, played by Ed Ma
her, "Cabbages and Things" colum
nist, is the son of John Twohig, and
provides a bit of love interest with
his passion for Christine, handled by
Mary Cogswell.
Lizzie Twohig (Mary Higgins)
wanders through life without ever
realizing that she is unhappy, until
properly educated. Mary Martin,
playing Annie. Mr. Twohig's wife,
somehow just can't see the new
drama, however, and refuses to keep
attending.
