# LEAVE US GROUSE
## 
### 
Now that the Daily editorial policy has hit
a city paper in what is at once a misleading and
inaccurate account, we are forced to state a
sort of Apologia for our recent critical attitude.
We are not, as the Examiner might lead one
to think, plotting to blow the administration
from its foundations with bombs at midnight,
nor are we after reforming the world tomorrow
afternoon. It's not nearly so simple as that.
It is quite true, as many people have pointed
ouMor a long time, that it is easier to criticize
than to suppor.t. However, there is one thing
that is easier still and much, much more dan
gerous. And that is the acceptance of things
as they are because they are that way.
The world is NOT right and most probably
never will be. Those who claim it is are either
deluded or tired. It is only the old and the
weary who cease to grouse; who say the
world's good enough; that we'll get by.
We are the young. It is our business to
grouse. It takes energy to complain, to try to
change things. Maybe we don't get anywhere.
Maybe we don't know altogether what we're
talking about. But that is no necessary indica
tion that those too tired to try any more know
any more than we.
You of the young who hang onto the status
quo, insisting that ours is the best possible
world, that Stanford—its men and women —are
the best as is and, withal, feel contented and
even a little self-righteous that this is so, are
betraying your own youth.
We are not then attempting to revolt against
the administration or to sabotage student or
ganization. We make mistakes sometimes;
people do.
We only want to think a little, to criticize,
to keep ourselves from slipping into the easy
way of acceptance. We don't get very far, of
course. Nobody does. But leave us grouse
'cause that's our business. Nancy Tilden.
