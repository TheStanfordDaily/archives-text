# Bull Session

### Dick Crane 
This is a notice to all sophisticates, dancers,
patriots, partytime people, and to all people
who love to spend a good evening.
On Saturday evening of this week, the last
week before dead week, there will be held on
the campus the most tremendous affair of the
quarter. It is going to be a dance —why, yes,
I'd love to —, and what a dance! Beautiful girls,
handsome men, and in general, the body beau
tiful in all ways, shapes and manners.
East meets West, as from Dartmouth's "Win
ter Carnival" comes the basic idea for the theme
of the party. A Snow Ball King, with surround
ings of beautiful coeds. Of course, there won't
be any snow, but what the hell is the differ
ence? Anyway, you aren't allowed to have such
stuff as snow around here because the Califor
nia chamber of commerce won't allow this type
•)t propaganda even as a publicity stunt.
The dance is being promoted by the AST of
Stanford University, and is the first big shindig
hey have ever attempted on the campus. It is
a closed dance as far as any other official

functions on the campus are concerned, and
the students responsible for putting the affair
on have been working very hard to promote a
big success.
The princesses of the court have been espe
cially picked, and who should have a better
eye for beauty than servicemen. After all,
their rooms are known to be plastered with
pin-up girls.
The candidates for the Snow Ball King are
to be voted on at the dance. A very selective
group has been chosen, with a few "dark
horses" thrown in to make general excitement
and added zest to the contest (by "dark horses,"
I mean the Pelt).
For many of the G.l.'s here at Stanford it will
be their last remembrance of what gay life is
around here. From here, who knows? At least
no more beautiful coeds, with sergeants tell
holes instead of desks; canteens instead of
professors; rifles instead of fountain pens; fox
holes instead of desgs; canteens instead of
glasses, and many other things that aren't too
jnice.
For us, the last chance to have our fling be
fore exams start —our last excuse for going out
nights instead of studying, and for some, the
last chance to get that date you have been
wanting to get all quarter.
