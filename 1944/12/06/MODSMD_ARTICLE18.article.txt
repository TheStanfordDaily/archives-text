# OUR HASHER
## 
### JOE SHER 
Having devoted a full column to the explana
tion of the intercollegiate athletic situation as
we saw it after investigation, it would be foolish
to argue with and try to convince every indi
vidual on campus who saw differently than we
did (by "we," I mean your hasher and, accord
ing to the petitions circulated, the majority of
the student body); therefore, to waste space on
the uninformed prattle of the various members
of the student body, would be to stoop to their
level. The old adage of "ignorance is bliss" can
be applied here and modified to "lack of in
formation is bliss" and believe you me they are
awfully happy.
The ancient and venarable hack, the Doge
mobile, is being returned to the bond wars.
This '27 Buick has more than paid for itself and
now will be auctioned off for whatever is bid
(within a reasonable figure.) Purchased for
$12,000 in bonds last year, the "Doge" will be
the prize of the entire drive and is a prize worth
winning.
The "Doge" is swell for packing a large group
into and heading out for a picnic into the sur
rounding hills and countryside. Roomy and
big,, it can hold at least 50 people (if 38 of
them hang on the outside). The old heap—and
I say that with fondness—is good for any out
ing; it knows all the roads practically by heart.
Thursday night when High gets a bid from
someone, all you have to do is go Higher and
Higher (a la Frankie).
A little "constructive criticism constructively
and honestly expressed," as well as a word of
advice to the writers of a letter to the Daily.
The views of the Bower about the Gaieties are
the opinions of Bower and I feel that no one
else who saw the show will be in least bit
influenced one way or the other about the mer
its or lack of merit of the Gaieties.
Everyone saw the show on Friday or Satur
day and had already made up his mind about
it. As far as Bower swaying their opinion, he
has been slamming pictures all year (honestly,
I believe) and the local movie houses are still
doing a flourishing business.
For the directors of the show to write a letter
to the Daily and take a definite offense is, to
my mind, childish and not at all like the true
nature of the authors of the letter. I am sure
that we have received no letters from the mem
bers of the Ballet Russe, whose show was
panned plenty. I personally thought it was
very good, with Johnny High especially good,
but making a campus issue of the revue does
the memories of the Gaieties no good. I also
love to receive mail.

The ancient and venarable hack, the Doge
mobile, is being returned to the bond wars.
This '27 Buick has more than paid for itself and
now will be auctioned off for whatever is bid
(within a reasonable figure.) Purchased for
$12,000 in bonds last year, the "Doge" will be
the prize of the entire drive and is a prize worth
winning.
The "Doge" is swell for packing a large group
into and heading out for a picnic into the sur
rounding hills and countryside. Roomy and
big,, it can hold at least 50 people (if 38 of
them hang on the outside). The old heap—and
I say that with fondness—is good for any out
ing; it knows all the roads practically by heart.
Thursday night when High gets a bid from
someone, all you have to do is go Higher and
Higher (a la Frankie).
A little "constructive criticism constructively
and honestly expressed," as well as a word of
advice to the writers of a letter to the Daily.
The views of the Bower about the Gaieties are
the opinions of Bower and I feel that no one
else who saw the show will be in least bit
influenced one way or the other about the mer
its or lack of merit of the Gaieties.
Everyone saw the show on Friday or Satur
day and had already made up his mind about
it. As far as Bower swaying their opinion, he
has been slamming pictures all year (honestly,
I believe) and the local movie houses are still
doing a flourishing business.
For the directors of the show to write a letter
to the Daily and take a definite offense is, to
my mind, childish and not at all like the true
nature of the authors of the letter. I am sure
that we have received no letters from the mem
bers of the Ballet Russe, whose show was
panned plenty. I personally thought it was
very good, with Johnny High especially good,
but making a campus issue of the revue does
the memories of the Gaieties no good. I also
love to receive mail.
Having devoted a full column to the explana
tion of the intercollegiate athletic situation as
we saw it after investigation, it would be foolish
to argue with and try to convince every indi
vidual on campus who saw differently than we
did (by "we," I mean your hasher and, accord
ing to the petitions circulated, the majority of
the student body); therefore, to waste space on
the uninformed prattle of the various members
of the student body, would be to stoop to their
level. The old adage of "ignorance is bliss" can
be applied here and modified to "lack of in
formation is bliss" and believe you me they are
awfully happy.
