The Editor:
Publications on this campus arc
somewhat like an Irish family—we
bicker and scrap among ourselves,
but present a solid front to any out
sider who horns in. Permit us to
show that front now.
In the San Francisco Examiner
Tuesday morning there appeared an
article about Stanford and its stu
dents' protests against "regimenta
tion," as it called it. This article
quoted liberally from Daily editori
als of the past few weeks.
We have admired the Daily's stand,
as exemplified in those editorials,
and our blood rapidly reached the
boiling point when we read the in
terpretation the Examiner put on it.
They twisted and distorted the facts
those editorials mentioned; they
threw in additional facts, credited
in a backhanded manner to the Daily,
facts of highly emotional tone and
of extremely doubtful authenticity.
They quoted your editorials out of
context, so as to put the highest pos

sible emotional coloring on them.
We believe that the Daily has gone
to considerable trouble to try to be
intelligent and serious about a prob
lem on campus that needs solving.
The Examiner, by its unhallowed
meddling, has knifed the efforts of
the Daily and of anyone else of seri
ous intent, in the back.
As Stanford students we wish to
repudiate that article in its entirety:
as fellow campus publishers, our
condemnation knows no bounds.
Very truly yours,
The STANFORD CHAPARRAL.
