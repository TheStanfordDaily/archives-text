# Arguello Romps Over Co. C, 31-17, To Win Mural Grid Championship
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
In a fitting climax to the fall intra
mural season at Stanford, Arguello
A.A.'s speedy and efficient grid ma
chine yesterday swamped the bat
tling Company "C" team, 31 to 7. to
cop the mural football crown for the
year. Arguello, operating from a
T formation, scored three times on
passes and twice on interceptions.
The freshmen, League II cham
pions, began rolling right from the
opening gun, scoring within five
minutes on a pass from Bradshaw
to Levy in the end zone. The con
version was no good. After taking
the kickoff, a costly fumble put Com
pany "C" on their own I-yard line.
On the next play, quarterback B*iid
shaw intercepted a soldier pass on
the 5 and crossed the goal for the
second score. The conversion again
■'ailed.
Army Outplayed
The game then see-sawed back and
forth, with Arguello consistently out
playing the League I champs, until
shortly before the half, when an
other Bradshaw pass dropped into
the arms of Dick Jennings in the
end zone for the third touchdown.
Jennings himself added the extra
point, and the score stood 19 to 0 at
the half.
The soldiers came back strong in
the second half, and brought the ball
well into Arguello territory before
they lost it on downs. Arguello
failed to make the necessary yard
age, and Company "C" again took
over. This time the soldiers' threat
was only averted when Bush, suf
fering from a head injury, dropped
Klein's pass in the end zone. The

I two teams roared back and forth on
I a fairly even basis until end Pyles of
Company "C" made a sensational
, catch of a prayer pass on the 2-yard
i line and fell into the end zone for
j the Army's only score. Elliott add
j ed the conversion.
Bradshaw Sensational
The touchdown march seemed to
! burn out the soldiers, for the rest
of the game was all Arguelio's. Mor
ley Thompson caught another pass
near the 5-yard line and crossed the
stripe to score again for the fresh
j men. The final touchdown came a
j couple of minutes later when Brad
j shaw, who played a brilliant game
all afternoon, intercepted a despera
tion pass at mid-field and raced all
l the way to paydirt unmolested. The
| conversion failed,' and the final score
i stood at 31-7 as the gun sounded
1 shortly atferward.
1
Passing Prevails
Both teams used almost entirely
1 a passing attack, and it was intercep
-1 lions by Levy, Jennings and Brad
| shaw that put Arguello in scoring

| position so much of the time.
In other games of the afternoon,
Alpha Kappa Kappa defeated Se
| quoia, 25 to 0, and Tyler defeated
J Toyon, to whom they had previously
lost, 14 to 6.
All announcements by depart
! ments, clubs, or other groups of the
1 University to be printed in the Daily
should be in this afternoon if they
are to be published, as tomorrow's

In a fitting climax to the fall intra
mural season at Stanford, Arguello
A.A.'s speedy and efficient grid ma
chine yesterday swamped the bat
tling Company "C" team, 31 to 7. to
cop the mural football crown for the
year. Arguello, operating from a
T formation, scored three times on
passes and twice on interceptions.
The freshmen, League II cham
pions, began rolling right from the
opening gun, scoring within five
minutes on a pass from Bradshaw
to Levy in the end zone. The con
version was no good. After taking
the kickoff, a costly fumble put Com
pany "C" on their own I-yard line.
On the next play, quarterback B*iid
shaw intercepted a soldier pass on
the 5 and crossed the goal for the
second score. The conversion again
■'ailed.
Army Outplayed
The game then see-sawed back and
forth, with Arguello consistently out
playing the League I champs, until
shortly before the half, when an
other Bradshaw pass dropped into
the arms of Dick Jennings in the
end zone for the third touchdown.
Jennings himself added the extra
point, and the score stood 19 to 0 at
the half.
The soldiers came back strong in
the second half, and brought the ball
well into Arguello territory before
they lost it on downs. Arguello
failed to make the necessary yard
age, and Company "C" again took
over. This time the soldiers' threat
was only averted when Bush, suf
fering from a head injury, dropped
Klein's pass in the end zone. The

I two teams roared back and forth on
I a fairly even basis until end Pyles of
Company "C" made a sensational
, catch of a prayer pass on the 2-yard
i line and fell into the end zone for
j the Army's only score. Elliott add
j ed the conversion.
Bradshaw Sensational
The touchdown march seemed to
! burn out the soldiers, for the rest
of the game was all Arguelio's. Mor
ley Thompson caught another pass
near the 5-yard line and crossed the
stripe to score again for the fresh
j men. The final touchdown came a
j couple of minutes later when Brad
j shaw, who played a brilliant game
all afternoon, intercepted a despera
tion pass at mid-field and raced all
l the way to paydirt unmolested. The
| conversion failed,' and the final score
i stood at 31-7 as the gun sounded
1 shortly atferward.
1
Passing Prevails
Both teams used almost entirely
1 a passing attack, and it was intercep
-1 lions by Levy, Jennings and Brad
| shaw that put Arguello in scoring

| position so much of the time.
In other games of the afternoon,
Alpha Kappa Kappa defeated Se
| quoia, 25 to 0, and Tyler defeated
J Toyon, to whom they had previously
lost, 14 to 6.
All announcements by depart
! ments, clubs, or other groups of the
