Stanford students have been hand
ed the opportunity to give Christ
mas presents to those G.l.'s in hos
pitals around the Bay area â€” it's
"Gifts for G.l.'s" week on ihe cam
pus.
Records, record albums and books
are wanted to (ill the libraries for
wounded servicemen, according to

co-chairmen Jane Reynolds and
Sally Van Dyke. Contributions may
be made through representatives in
the various living groups, or placed
in boxes located in the library, the
Bookstore, and the Cellar.
"Don't give away books and rec
ords that are castoffs, or in poor con
dition,'" the co-chairmen cautioned.
"A list of those voted 'tops' by ser
vicemen will be printed in tomor
row's Daily."
Sponsored by Women's Confer
ence, the campaign was presented
to the group after several students
had hit upon the idea that Stanford
students would like to contribute
gifts to the hospitalized servicemen
of their own free will. All books will
have the name of the donor on the
Hyleaf.
