The fighting on the northern end
of the Siegfried line is going a little
bad, but the Allied offensive might
yet be put through by virtue of the
progress in the south.
The Seventh Army is a big factor
in what happens next. Its pincer at
tack launched against Belfort in the
midst of a snowstorm, levered the
Germans out and two armored arms
have stretched out to the Rhine, one
from Dasel to Colmar and the other
at Strassbourg.
Moves
Now these two pincers are trying
to snap shut in order to prevent the
retreat of the Germans to the Rhine.
After they meet, three things might
happen.
First, if the Germans have been
too badly mauled or else trapped,
the Seventh Army might push across
the Rhine and try to drive through
the mountain and forest defiles of
Baden before the Germans could
bring up reinforcements. Second, if
the Germans are strong enough to
hold the river, the Seventh Army
might leave a rearguard to cover
the newly gained left bank and then
drive north along the rail line from
Strassbourg to Mainz, joining with
General Patton's right wing and, by
sheer weight of numbers, pushing in
the opposing German left on the
Saare river line. Third, one of those
swatches that resulted in the break
through to Tunis and Bizerte in this
war as well as the successful Meuse-
Argonne offensive of the last war,
might result, the Seventh Army
being shifted to the north, except
for a rearguard, and thrust through
the enemy lines there.
• General Patton's success at the
Saare river line might influence
Allied plans for the Seventh, but the
battle here is in too embryonic a
stage to predict. For this reason, the
movement on the Mainz line might
be employed, as it could be decisive.
This depends on how much of a rear
guard the Seventh Army would have
to leave at the Rhine, and how much
of its strength would have to be
used to guard communications or
was lost during the offensive.
