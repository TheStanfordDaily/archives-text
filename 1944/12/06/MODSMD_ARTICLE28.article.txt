# War Fund Money Due Tomorrow
## 
### 
All pledges made during last
month's War Fund Drive must be
fulfilled today or tomorrow, Joan
McDonough said last night.
Any student who pledged a certain
amount to the fund may pay in cash
or by check from 1 to 5 p.m. today
and at the same hours tomorrow in
the War Board office on the second
floor of the Old Union.
"The unpaid money must be
turned in," Miss McDonough empha
sized. "Proceeds from the Stanford
drive will be distributed among five
charities."
