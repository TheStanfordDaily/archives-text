# Ratlin Explains War Crimes

### 
"The generation that exists now
lias no easy (ask before it at the end
of the War," Dr. Max Ratlin declared
in concluding his discussion of "War
Criminals" on the Tuesday Evening
Series program last night.
Dr. Radin, who is a professor of
law at the University of California,
discussed the legal aspects of the
trial and punishment of war crim
inals.
He began with a brief review of
what happened at the end of the last
war, when many war criminals were
turned over to Germany to be tried
in German courts. Few of these
were punished, and those who were
received very light punishment.
Professor Radin answered the
question of what constitutes a war
crime. Unfortunately, we are not
yet in a position to say that persons
who conspire to make war are crim
inals, though that is desirable in the
future.
A war crime is an act which would
be a crime in peacetime and which
cannot be construed as contributing
to military success. Such an act is
criminal even if committed under
orders, provided the accused cannot
prove that failure to commit it wÂ®uid
have meant his own death.
War criminals must be tried in a
specially constituted international
court, said Dr. Radin. There are
no real legal difficulties in doing
this. Lack of precedent is not a con
trolling factor.
The fundamental principle of the
legal attitude toward crime, accord
ing to Professor Rabin, is deterrence.
We must avoid punishment on the
principle of vengeance and "lynch
law," which often punishes the
wrong people.
