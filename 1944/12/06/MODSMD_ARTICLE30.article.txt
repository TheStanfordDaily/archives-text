### 
Stanford students will receive a
super-duper Christmas present from
the Chaparral staff on December 15.
It's the bigger-and-better-than-ever
Chappie, featuring a Yuletide theme
and a center spread on a pertinent
subject by former Old Boy Dovg
Hastings.
Gugel was counting the inches of
jokes when we walked in.
"Twenty?" we asked. "Thirty . . .
he murmured . . . "Forty . . . ?"
"'Fifty!—a helluva lot of jokes."
Grand total: 120 inches of jokes!
"Lots of other red-hot stuff, too,"
he mused. "Buy copies to send to
friends and servicemen." And one
for yourself, students, will pull you
out of that finals fatigue.
Barney was singing, so we left.
The song went like this:
"Lotsa gags bout old Chris Kringle,
He'll make yo' liver juices tingle.
The Xmas Chappie's really nice ...
25 cents is the regular price."
