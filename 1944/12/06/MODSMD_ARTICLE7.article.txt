## 
### 
''Is Life Worth Living?" gay Irish
comedy written by Lennox Robin
son, opens tonight at 8:15 in the Lit
tle Theater, and will continue
through next Monday night. Good
seats are still available, especially
for tonight and Monday, and may be
obtained in the box office.
The plot concerns the disastrous
effect a group of thespians have upon
the happy Celtic folk of Inish when
they descend with their interpreta
tions of the Russian and Scandina
vian dramatists concerned with the
futility of life. The difficulty comes
when the simple Irish citizens began
to believe implicitly everything they
saw acted by the De la Marc Stock
Company.
Constance Constantia, played by
Sally Stocker (a redhead for the
part) and Hector De la Mare, taken
by George Crane, form the nucleus
of the earnest players who descend
upon Inish with their terrible tales
of realism.
Martin Nalder, as Mr. John Two
hit;, is the proprietor of the Seaview
Hotel, where the action takes place,
and his wife, Annie (Mary Martin)
and his sister, Lizzie (Mary Higgins)
add to the confusion of the situa
tion.
Christine and Eddie team up to
form the love interest in this pro
duction, and Mary Cogswell and Ed
tnond Maher take these two parts.
Patricia Nielsen, taking the part
of Helena, the Seaview's little maid
with dramatic aspirations, rather
startles the cast with her amazing
talents.
Michael, the boot, is played by
Richard Moorsteen, and Milton Val
entine becomes an Irish politician
who too is also influenced by the
higher drama.
