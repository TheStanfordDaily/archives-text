In which 0 enlists your aid in filling a most urgent need
More Than Any Other—
This Gift Exemplifies the
True Spirit of Christmas
Th is Christmas, 1944, millions of our
young men and women are spending
the "holiday season" - fighting in
steaming Philippine jungles-slogging
through Italian mud-storming the bristling pillboxes of the Reich. Tough work. Bloody work. Costly in
human nerves, bodies, lives. One indispensable medical discovery has already saved thousands of lives—
the miracle of blood plasma—the miracle that you alone can give our fighting men. * * * This Christmas,
1944, with the speed-up tempo of the attack, enormous supplies of human blood plasma are needed.
Right now, in the Bay Area, for its weekly quota of 6,000 filled plasma units, the Red Cross must have
8,200 donors per week, to meet this critical need. * * * Part of this huge quota is the blood (from
certain type donors) being used for Type "O" (whole blood) which is effective in extreme cases, for seri
ously wounded beyond the help of ordinary plasma. So critical is the need for this Type "O" blood, thai
the Navy is now using refrigerator-equipped transport planes to fly it, in 48 hours, 7,000 miles into the
Pacific battle areas . . . valid proof of its urgency. * * ★ This Christmas, 1944, no gift is more fitting,
more in keeping with the warm,
unselfish spirit of Christmas, than
the gift of life itself-your blood for
a wounded man. Make your appoint
ment with the Red Cross Blood Donor
Service this week. Send your blood
to battle - that some soldier, some
where, may live to see peace on earth.
