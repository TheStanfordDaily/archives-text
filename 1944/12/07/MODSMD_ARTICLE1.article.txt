# River Crossed At Four New Points Today

PARIS, Thursday, Dec. 7 (UP).â€”
The U.S. Third Army captured two
thirds of the Saar factory city of
Sarreguemines Thursday after a 12-
mile march by its infantry, crossed
the river at four new points farther
west to outflank the Siegfried fort
ress of Merzig, and met German
armor in a ringing tank battle on
the cast flank of a 50-mile Saar
Basin front.
Nine divisions of Lt. Gen. George
S. Patton's army were pounding out
deep advances that had brought vir
tually the entire 726-square-mile
mining and manufacturing basin,
second only to the Ruhr as a source
of German war strength in the west,
within the Yanks' grasp.
Desjferate to break the strangle
grip on the vital basin, large Ger
man panzer forces challenged spear
heads of Major Gen. John S. Wood's
Fourth Armored Division in the
Rohrbach area, 12 miles southeast of
Sarreguemines, and a bitter battle
was reported raging in that sector
last night.
