# U.S. Reaction: Unity
## 
### 
In the racing minutes and hours that followed Pearl Harbor,
war correspondents all over the world recorded the reactions of
the people, and the scattered bits of news that filled in the com
plete picture of treachery and its wake.
The Daily reprints here excerpts from "December 7—The
First Thirty Hours," a book compiling the wires and cables filed
by Time, Life, and Fortune correspondents.
WASHINGTON, State Department, 2:26 p.m.—Wilmott Ragsdale.
The radio flash gave Roosevelt's statement that Pearl Harbor
had been attacked. The Japanese (envoys) had handed Cordell
Hull the reply to his "document" or principles issued last Nov.
26. Hull "carefully read the statement . . . turned to the Japanese
ambassador and with the greatest indignation said: . . never
seen a document more crowded with infamous falsehood and
distortions.' "
2:40 p.m.—Two Japanese masks walked out of Hull's office,
got their hats, and pushed through forty reporters to the elevator.
"Is this your last conference?" No reply.
"Have you any statement?" No reply.
"Did you reply to Mr. Hull's document?" "Yes."
WASHINGTON, White house—Ed Lockett.
