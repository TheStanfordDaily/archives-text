# U.S. Reaction: Unity
## 
### 
In the racing minutes and hours that followed Pearl Harbor,
war correspondents all over the world recorded the reactions of
the people, and the scattered bits of news that filled in the com
plete picture of treachery and its wake.
The Daily reprints here excerpts from "December 7—The
First Thirty Hours," a book compiling the wires and cables filed
by Time, Life, and Fortune correspondents.
WASHINGTON, State Department, 2:26 p.m.—Wilmott Ragsdale.
The radio flash gave Roosevelt's statement that Pearl Harbor
had been attacked. The Japanese (envoys) had handed Cordell
Hull the reply to his "document" or principles issued last Nov.
26. Hull "carefully read the statement . . . turned to the Japanese
ambassador and with the greatest indignation said: . . never
seen a document more crowded with infamous falsehood and
distortions.' "
2:40 p.m.—Two Japanese masks walked out of Hull's office,
got their hats, and pushed through forty reporters to the elevator.
"Is this your last conference?" No reply.
"Have you any statement?" No reply.
"Did you reply to Mr. Hull's document?" "Yes."
WASHINGTON, White house—Ed Lockett.
LOS ANGELES—Sidney James.
The hottest spot in this area is Los Angeles harbor, and spe
cifically, Terminal Island. Earliest radio broadcasts told of the
rounding up of all this area's 3,000 Japanese.
If you chance to take a cab the driver might tell you, "I live
next door to a Jap family, nice people, too. Hell, they're said to
give more tips than any 'white man."
MANlLA—Melville Jacoby.
The Philippines overnight assumed a war basis with censor
ships, roundup of aliens, rationing, continual blackouts, evacua
tion of populated areas.
The Japs have mixed altitude bombing, dive bombing, and
strafing round in all major attacks.
WASHINGTON, Chamber of the House of Representatives.
Down the line, without a break, the isolationists voted for
war. . . . Irving Swanson, the clerk reading the roll call, called
Rankin of Montana.
"No," Jeannette Rankin smiled.
"Ssssss." The hiss echoed through the House chamber and
Rayburn violently pounded the gavel until the razzing subsided.
Swanson proceeded with his roll call. . . .
At 1:32 p.m., 8 minutes short of an hour after the President
finished (his war message), Congress had voted war against
Japan—it was almost an anticlimax in the House and the Senate.
There was no prayerful silence such as when the roll was
called on amending the Neutrality Act, no days of debate, no
sguabbling, no back-biting. It was just the American Congress,
its neck bowed, its back arched, and itself buckled down to the
job of giving blood, sweat, and tears in any volume necessary
to defeat the most audacious attack of the aggressors.
Washington was recovering from Saturday night peacefully
enough on Sunday when the news came ... at approximately
2:20 the telephone rang in all these (press association) offices.
From the other end of the wire came these words: "This is Steve
Early. I'm calling from home. I have a statement here which
the President has asked me to read." Then Early read to the three
services the President's statement which told the United States
that Hawaii was being bombed. He closed up the brief conversa
tion with the remark that he was going directly to the White
House and "I'll tell you' more later."
Before Early could get out of his house, however, he had to
make another telephone call to the press associations—this time
again on the three-way hookup to advise that at 2:36 there had
also been an attack on Manila.
WASHINGTON, Japanese Embassy—Felix Belair.
Early in the afternoon the crowds began gathering across the
street from the Japanese Embassy . . . just before 3 o'clock in
the afternoon a couple of lackies were seen by local reporters
to carry out a half-dozen sguare five-gallon tins stuffed with
papers over which they poured an unidentified liquid. There
were a few whiffs of yellow smoke and, presumably, the papers
were gone.
WASHINGTON—Jerry Green.
Of all the government buildings seen in a quick survey of
downtown Washington, in only one were all lights flaring and
all offices obviously occupied, with all help moving at top speed.
That was the narrow, tall office building just to the north of the
Munitions Building . . . the headquarters of Selective Service.
j PITTSBURGH-Robert Hagy.
(A quotation from isolationist Gerald P. Nye speaking before
a group of America First members.)
"It sounds terribly fishy to me. Can't we have some details?
Is it sabotage or is it open attack? I'm amazed the President
should announce an attack without giving details."
BOSTON—John Durant.
For quotes of the man on the street, I like best the fellow who
said to me, "That settles it. We're united now." A waitress —
"There's been too much talk and not enough action—let's get
going." A schoolteacher, "Let them have it, they asked for it."
A sailor, "It's me or them—and I'll make damn sure it's not me."
A shopkeeper, "This is one war the United States will approve
of." Everywhere you went it was the same, united at last, go
out and get those Japs.
DETROIT—Robert Strother.
The reaction was an unsurprised, "Well, there it goes." It
was a clear crisp day after a succession of murky ones and an
unusually large number of people were out riding with their
I car radios turned on.
Men who called newspapers were generally both angry and
cheerful. "Here we go! Happy landings!" one said when told
the news was true. One fellow was good and mad. "Why, d
those Japs, sitting down in Washington talking terms and then—
whambo!" Some women callers burst into tears when the news
was confirmed. "Oh, gee gee. Now he'll probably get shot,"
! one said as she hung up.
CHICAGO—FiII Calhoun.
Someone just phoned to say that the Chicago Tribune has
revived its banner heading "My country, right or wrong."

war. . . . Irving Swanson, the clerk reading the roll call, called
Rankin of Montana.
"No," Jeannette Rankin smiled.
"Ssssss." The hiss echoed through the House chamber and
Rayburn violently pounded the gavel until the razzing subsided.
Swanson proceeded with his roll call. . . .
At 1:32 p.m., 8 minutes short of an hour after the President
finished (his war message), Congress had voted war against
Japan—it was almost an anticlimax in the House and the Senate.
There was no prayerful silence such as when the roll was
called on amending the Neutrality Act, no days of debate, no
sguabbling, no back-biting. It was just the American Congress,
its neck bowed, its back arched, and itself buckled down to the
job of giving blood, sweat, and tears in any volume necessary
to defeat the most audacious attack of the aggressors.
Washington was recovering from Saturday night peacefully
enough on Sunday when the news came ... at approximately
2:20 the telephone rang in all these (press association) offices.
From the other end of the wire came these words: "This is Steve
Early. I'm calling from home. I have a statement here which
the President has asked me to read." Then Early read to the three
services the President's statement which told the United States
that Hawaii was being bombed. He closed up the brief conversa
tion with the remark that he was going directly to the White
House and "I'll tell you' more later."
Before Early could get out of his house, however, he had to
make another telephone call to the press associations—this time
again on the three-way hookup to advise that at 2:36 there had
also been an attack on Manila.
WASHINGTON, Japanese Embassy—Felix Belair.
Early in the afternoon the crowds began gathering across the
street from the Japanese Embassy . . . just before 3 o'clock in
the afternoon a couple of lackies were seen by local reporters
to carry out a half-dozen sguare five-gallon tins stuffed with
papers over which they poured an unidentified liquid. There
were a few whiffs of yellow smoke and, presumably, the papers
were gone.
WASHINGTON—Jerry Green.
Of all the government buildings seen in a quick survey of
downtown Washington, in only one were all lights flaring and
all offices obviously occupied, with all help moving at top speed.
That was the narrow, tall office building just to the north of the
Munitions Building . . . the headquarters of Selective Service.

(A quotation from isolationist Gerald P. Nye speaking before

"It sounds terribly fishy to me. Can't we have some details?
Is it sabotage or is it open attack? I'm amazed the President
should announce an attack without giving details."
BOSTON—John Durant.
For quotes of the man on the street, I like best the fellow who
said to me, "That settles it. We're united now." A waitress —
"There's been too much talk and not enough action—let's get
going." A schoolteacher, "Let them have it, they asked for it."
A sailor, "It's me or them—and I'll make damn sure it's not me."
A shopkeeper, "This is one war the United States will approve
of." Everywhere you went it was the same, united at last, go
out and get those Japs.
DETROIT—Robert Strother.
The reaction was an unsurprised, "Well, there it goes." It
was a clear crisp day after a succession of murky ones and an
unusually large number of people were out riding with their
I car radios turned on.
Men who called newspapers were generally both angry and
cheerful. "Here we go! Happy landings!" one said when told
the news was true. One fellow was good and mad. "Why, d
those Japs, sitting down in Washington talking terms and then—
whambo!" Some women callers burst into tears when the news
was confirmed. "Oh, gee gee. Now he'll probably get shot,"
! one said as she hung up.

WASHINGTON, State Department, 2:26 p.m.—Wilmott Ragsdale.
The radio flash gave Roosevelt's statement that Pearl Harbor
had been attacked. The Japanese (envoys) had handed Cordell
Hull the reply to his "document" or principles issued last Nov.
26. Hull "carefully read the statement . . . turned to the Japanese
ambassador and with the greatest indignation said: . . never
seen a document more crowded with infamous falsehood and
distortions.' "
2:40 p.m.—Two Japanese masks walked out of Hull's office,
got their hats, and pushed through forty reporters to the elevator.
"Is this your last conference?" No reply.
"Have you any statement?" No reply.
"Did you reply to Mr. Hull's document?" "Yes."

WASHINGTON, State Department, 2:26 p.m.—Wilmott Ragsdale.
The radio flash gave Roosevelt's statement that Pearl Harbor
had been attacked. The Japanese (envoys) had handed Cordell
Hull the reply to his "document" or principles issued last Nov.
26. Hull "carefully read the statement . . . turned to the Japanese
ambassador and with the greatest indignation said: . . never
seen a document more crowded with infamous falsehood and
distortions.' "
2:40 p.m.—Two Japanese masks walked out of Hull's office,
got their hats, and pushed through forty reporters to the elevator.
"Is this your last conference?" No reply.
"Have you any statement?" No reply.
"Did you reply to Mr. Hull's document?" "Yes."

Down the line, without a break, the isolationists voted for
war. . . . Irving Swanson, the clerk reading the roll call, called
Rankin of Montana.

Rayburn violently pounded the gavel until the razzing subsided.
Swanson proceeded with his roll call. . . .
At 1:32 p.m., 8 minutes short of an hour after the President
finished (his war message), Congress had voted war against
Japan—it was almost an anticlimax in the House and the Senate.
There was no prayerful silence such as when the roll was
called on amending the Neutrality Act, no days of debate, no
sguabbling, no back-biting. It was just the American Congress,
its neck bowed, its back arched, and itself buckled down to the
job of giving blood, sweat, and tears in any volume necessary
to defeat the most audacious attack of the aggressors.
Washington was recovering from Saturday night peacefully
enough on Sunday when the news came ... at approximately
2:20 the telephone rang in all these (press association) offices.
From the other end of the wire came these words: "This is Steve
Early. I'm calling from home. I have a statement here which
the President has asked me to read." Then Early read to the three
services the President's statement which told the United States
that Hawaii was being bombed. He closed up the brief conversa
tion with the remark that he was going directly to the White
House and "I'll tell you' more later."
Before Early could get out of his house, however, he had to
make another telephone call to the press associations—this time
again on the three-way hookup to advise that at 2:36 there had
also been an attack on Manila.
