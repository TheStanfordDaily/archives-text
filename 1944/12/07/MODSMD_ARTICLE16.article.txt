# 'Doge' To Go On Auction 7:30 Tonight
## 
### 
Once more the D.G.-Monroe Hall
"Dogemobile" will take its place in
the auction spotlight, as students
gather in the Nitery at 7:30 in an
attempt to put Stanford over the
$27,500 top in the Sixth War Loan
Drive. Cardinals are sponsoring the
auction as a vital part of Stanford's
observation of Pearl Harbor Day,
according to Chairman Charlie
Clark.
Bidding for the Doge will begin
at $5,000, a total worthy of its
lengthy history. Last year's di
plomacy involved the Kappas, the
Chi O's, and ultimately the D.G.'s, as
the Monroe men plotted to capture
the auto that had been purchased
by three campus women the year
before for $30. McKinley had
raised $6,000 for bidding, the Chi O's
about $5,000 on the afternoon of the
auction. The D.G.-Monroe team
plunged into the bidding, however,
which quickly became intense be
tween them and the C'ri O's. The
winning bid was $12,500 —leaving
the victors about $700 short, ac
cording to a part-owner. The next
morning found the team soliciting
the remainder in Palo Alto, and
adding nearly $2,000 to their bid.
Like last year, the bidding will
be scored on an accumulative basis,
so that win or lose, the bidders must
pay the top amount they have called
out. Pledge bidding is in order.
The Dogemobile, a '27 Buick lim
ousine with a nameless passenger
capacity, is red and black and usu
ally resides in the driveway at
Monroe.
Dates with such campus notables
as Bobby Upshaw, Ric Supple, and
Joe Slier will be auctioned by Em
cee Johnny High. Hotel dinner
dance bids, thanks to the efforts of
Dick Fayram, will be offered, along
with passes to the Stanford Thea
ter. Kleenex and a carton of ciga
rettes are added attractions.
Entertainment, is being provided
by Martha Austin's hula, the songs
ol the Chalet Quartette, piano num
bers by, boogie arlist Herb Zimmer
man, and renditions by Scotty Al
len's "War Bond Boys."

attempt to put Stanford over the
$27,500 top in the Sixth War Loan
Drive. Cardinals are sponsoring the
auction as a vital part of Stanford's
observation of Pearl Harbor Day,
according to Chairman Charlie
Clark.
Bidding for the Doge will begin
at $5,000, a total worthy of its
lengthy history. Last year's di
plomacy involved the Kappas, the
Chi O's, and ultimately the D.G.'s, as
the Monroe men plotted to capture
the auto that had been purchased
by three campus women the year
before for $30. McKinley had
raised $6,000 for bidding, the Chi O's
about $5,000 on the afternoon of the
auction. The D.G.-Monroe team
plunged into the bidding, however,
which quickly became intense be
tween them and the C'ri O's. The
winning bid was $12,500 —leaving
the victors about $700 short, ac
cording to a part-owner. The next
morning found the team soliciting
the remainder in Palo Alto, and
adding nearly $2,000 to their bid.
Like last year, the bidding will
be scored on an accumulative basis,
so that win or lose, the bidders must
pay the top amount they have called
out. Pledge bidding is in order.
The Dogemobile, a '27 Buick lim
ousine with a nameless passenger
capacity, is red and black and usu
ally resides in the driveway at
Monroe.
Dates with such campus notables
as Bobby Upshaw, Ric Supple, and
Joe Slier will be auctioned by Em
cee Johnny High. Hotel dinner
dance bids, thanks to the efforts of
Dick Fayram, will be offered, along
with passes to the Stanford Thea
ter. Kleenex and a carton of ciga
rettes are added attractions.
Entertainment, is being provided

ol the Chalet Quartette, piano num
bers by, boogie arlist Herb Zimmer
