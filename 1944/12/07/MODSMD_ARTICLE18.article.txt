to sell rides for war stamps in jeeps,
and possibly a scout, car and "half

War Loan drive," Bond Chairman

and Gamma Phi hashers, $250, 8.33.
Pledges do not count on hasher

day to affect team standings, Mis.s
Edwards asserted. Hashers are
asked to turn in war bond money to
the War Board office today.
Soldiers who demonstrate jeeps
