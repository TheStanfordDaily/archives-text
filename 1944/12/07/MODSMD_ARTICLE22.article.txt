# DO WE REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR?
## 
### 
December 7, 1344 — three long and bloody
years after that insane Sunday in 1941; as we
examine the state of the nation, of Stanford, do
we "find it good?"
We find much in our society that is curious,
in view of our position as a nation at total war.
We find bitter racial conflict, economic warfare
between labor and labor, and between corpora
tion and corporation, a lack of faith in the pur
poses of the war, a lack of faith in the things we
are supposed to be fighting for—above all,
there is unreality in these, the "days of our
years."
Certainly we lack unity, the unity that
gripped us so intensely during the beginning
months of our war.
Perhaps our inability to understand what has
gone wrong with this, our land, is the plight of
every people at war. But there is a danger if
we do not find out what is wrong, for although
we will win the war—our internal disunity, lack
of faith in the purposes of the conflict, are de
stroying even the possibilities of a lasting
peace.
This is one world, but this is also one nation,
and unless there is a reconciliation of the ele
ments at war with one another in this country,
PEARL HARBOR will be written off as one of
history's bitter jokes.
