"If we are to progress as a democracy, the
people of the United Stales must make use of
raw human resources with the same devotion
and imagination used in developing material
resources. Mere color is not the gauge of abil
ity, nor the true test of superiority.
"The full power of the Republic cannot be
realized until racial minorities among our citi
zens achieve the same rights and means of edu
cation and development as other citizens. We
will set a poor example for the world if we
are unable to promote racial tranquillity at

eration to eradicate the germs of war if we can
not destroy the seeds of discontent and abolish
sub-standard citienship in our own land.
"The task must be started from the grass
roots, must not be abdicated to the whim of the
state —which already is tempted to legislate
equality of all kinds. The people themselves—
and this means first the majority whites—must
resist by enlightened action the efforts of Fas
cist or Communist to set race against race; must
promote by humanitarian example full accept
ance and practice of our fundamental demo
cratic principles.
"The principles are not divisible; they were
not intended to apply to some but not to all.
They supply for ihe edifice of our nation a cor
nerstone which if broken or removed would
bring the structure tumbling down upon major

"We in California have successively used

ated, it will ultimately result in incalculable
harm to our state; and in a definite loss in self
