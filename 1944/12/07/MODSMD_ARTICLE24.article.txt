						COMMITTEE IS A FUNNY THING

### 
A committee is a funny thing at Stanford. Or
maybe it's just a funny thing anywhere. It is
made up of a certain kind of people. You have
heard of the committee man and the committee
woman? Well, they're it.
There is nothing the matter with committee
work. In fact it is usually tedious, small, cook
and-bottle-washing sort of work that has got to
be done and that very few people really want
to do.
But there is something the matter with these
people who are everlastingly just on commit
tees without doing a lick of any kind of work.
Have you ever heard some poor, harassed ex
ecutive trying to get members for his commit
tee? That's the tip-off.
He gets them by asking, "Wouldn't you like
to be on my committee- You wouldn't have to
do much work, really. And we have lots of
swell Joes on it—just a party-time."
Sure that's how he gets them. And that's also
just about as much good as they are. You know
who does the tedious, small, cook-and-bottle
washing work that has got to be done, the same
harassed guy who needed a committee to help
him, of course, and he could have done it easier
without their help in all probability.
Which all comes down to one thing. There
are committee men and there are people who
actually work on committees. There are "lead
ers" and workers. There are "doers" and "be
ers."
In the Middle Ages it was counted a sin, not
an awfully big one, of course, to promise what
you could not do. In which case it is terrifying
to consider the tremendous load of sins carried
by those who are forever promising to "work"
on committees.—Nancy Tilden
