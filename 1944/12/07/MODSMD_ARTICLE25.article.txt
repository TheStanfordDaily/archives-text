Many editorials have been written this guar
ter on the loss of spirit of the students of this
University. The whole problem of the apathy
of the student body is being brought to the fore
by the Daily, and many leaders of student gov
ernment here at Stanford, and the whole prob
lem revolves around the guestion of the solu
tion to this.
The cause of the "Ivory Tower" attitude can
not be exactly determined, nor even can the
explanation of what it is be really known, but it
certainly is generally agreed that lack of spirit
is very prevalent on the Stanford campus at this
time.
What are we going to do about it? Do any
of you have any suggestions? If you do, would
you like to try them out?
This campus needs a lot of ideas, and a lot
of people who are interested in this University
for itself, and not merely coming here for their
own interests. I grant you that reaching your
objective in colege is the basic thing, but this
University cannot be expected to survive as a
great institution of higher learning without the
extracurricular activities of interested students
in such things, for example, as student govern
ment, the Daily, the Quad, the excellent lectures
given by talented men, which have been having
poor attendance.
All these functions help to organize and knit
together the students as one group. This is a
very small University as far as attendance is
concerned, and lack of organization among the
students shouldn't be noticeable at all, but it
is, which creates a difficult problem.
The students who are in the student organiza
tions, and the leaders of these groups, are in my
opinion highly incompetent. It isn't their fault,
and I admire them for their interest in Stanford,
but they just don't have it!
I could continue on this subject, and name
specific examples, but that isn't the case in
point. I merely want to bring out the fact that
we definitely need all you people who are
actually aware that Stanford is in the doldrums,
and we want you to get in and help us out.
A lot of you who have talents along this line
say, I wouldn't have a.chance, as all the mem
bers are picked by a cut and dried' proposi
tion. This is wrong, and although you don't
realize it, the leaders responsible for choosing
committee heads, and other campus function
aries, have a crying need for you now. So how
about everybody giving Stanford a break, and
really getting interested in the University.
There are concrete steps being taken right
now for curing our ills, but the students in
volved in this plan can't carry the whole load,
nor can the administration do too much. It is
Y° u an d you only, who can do the major part
in helping your own ailments.

about everybody giving Stanford a break, and
really getting interested in the University.
There are concrete steps being taken right
now for curing our ills, but the students in
volved in this plan can't carry the whole load,
nor can the administration do too much. It is
Y° u an d you only, who can do the major part
in helping your own ailments.
Many editorials have been written this guar
ter on the loss of spirit of the students of this
University. The whole problem of the apathy
of the student body is being brought to the fore
by the Daily, and many leaders of student gov
ernment here at Stanford, and the whole prob
lem revolves around the guestion of the solu
tion to this.
The cause of the "Ivory Tower" attitude can
not be exactly determined, nor even can the
explanation of what it is be really known, but it
certainly is generally agreed that lack of spirit
is very prevalent on the Stanford campus at this
time.
What are we going to do about it? Do any
of you have any suggestions? If you do, would
you like to try them out?
This campus needs a lot of ideas, and a lot
of people who are interested in this University
for itself, and not merely coming here for their
own interests. I grant you that reaching your
objective in colege is the basic thing, but this
University cannot be expected to survive as a
great institution of higher learning without the
extracurricular activities of interested students
in such things, for example, as student govern
ment, the Daily, the Quad, the excellent lectures
given by talented men, which have been having
poor attendance.
All these functions help to organize and knit
together the students as one group. This is a
very small University as far as attendance is
concerned, and lack of organization among the
students shouldn't be noticeable at all, but it
is, which creates a difficult problem.
The students who are in the student organiza
tions, and the leaders of these groups, are in my
opinion highly incompetent. It isn't their fault,
and I admire them for their interest in Stanford,
but they just don't have it!
I could continue on this subject, and name
specific examples, but that isn't the case in
point. I merely want to bring out the fact that
we definitely need all you people who are
actually aware that Stanford is in the doldrums,
and we want you to get in and help us out.
A lot of you who have talents along this line
say, I wouldn't have a.chance, as all the mem
bers are picked by a cut and dried' proposi
tion. This is wrong, and although you don't
realize it, the leaders responsible for choosing
committee heads, and other campus function
aries, have a crying need for you now. So how
about everybody giving Stanford a break, and
really getting interested in the University.
