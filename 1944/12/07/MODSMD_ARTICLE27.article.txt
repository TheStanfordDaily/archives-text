# Our Hasher Sez:

### Joe Sher 
Beware:
As the campus waits with bated
breath, the Old Boy, Barney Gu
gel, goes around peering into win
dows trying to make contracts to
sell copies of the rag, which will
come out next week.
This edition of the Chappie is ex
pected to create havoc on the cam
pus, filled as it is with more jokes,
more stories, and more pictures
than ever before. If one should
see students rolling around on the
ground clutching their sides it is
not a case of the D.T.'s but only in
mates of the Farm chortling over
a sample of the Chappie's ghoulish
humor.
King Nominations
Some of the leading lights who
have been overlooked in the search
tor the Snowball King are Pete (he
has cigarettes) Keesmaat, Norm
(the Mole) Muhlholland, Claude
(the bell ringer) Straus—no rela
tion to the writer of sweet songs,—
Elliot (war fronts) Epsteen, Dave
(I can write what I please) Davis,
and old Joe No Wheels, the Union
gardener. Any of these dignitaries
would make an excellent choice, so
let's keep them in mind when voting.
Daily Orgy
The Daily banquet will be held
at one of the local eating houses at
the end of this week. Every reporter
and member of the staff will be
there, or at least all of those who
can afford the two skins necessary
for the dinner.
A tremendous program has been
planned to entertain the group and
it has been planned to appeal to the
state of the staff. New officers and
old will slap each other on the back
and exchange little thoughts. The
incoming member will probably be
thinking, "He did a hell of a job I
can easily do better," while the out
going member will probably think,
a job as I did and I don't know why
"This turkey can never do as good
he is even going tc try."
Of course no one will say any of
this, for they will exchange little
witticisms and pleasantries, com
plimenting each other and them-

selves on a good job, which was well
| done and is well enough done. Put
| down that pistol, babe.
Over at Last!
This is the next to last edition of
Our Hasher lor this quarter (stop
those sighs of relief), and our read
ers will have an opportunity to recu
| pc-rate tor a tew weeks before they
I are subjected to more of the usual
| and the unusual.
The hashers' grapevine is becom
| ing withered and old, and it needs
| refreshing, so I believe the rest will
; do us both good. 1 feel, though, that
! the students will miss the Daily in
j the time it is gone. No longer will
■ they be able to use it for the many
j purposes to which it readily adapts
itself, but they will have to revert
to old standbys which are tough to
get nowadays with the paper short
age.
Nothing to gripe at, nothing to
laugh at, nothing to tear up for con
fetti, nothing to wipe up spilled
coflee with, in fact—nothing, the
life blood of the school which is al
ready plenty dilute, now will be
even more so, oh wo bo.
