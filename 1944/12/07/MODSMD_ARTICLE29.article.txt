# WAR FRONTS

### A. GARNEY BUGEL Chappie Cohort Elliot Epsteen 
Two prominent readers dropped
in yesterday. They said that they
had plenty of dope and wanted to
take the column over for once. When
you read the very last line, you'll
know they're just frustrated. So
here it is—hoping it does Chappie
sales some yood.

It is becoming more and more ap
j parent that the situation on all
i fronts is rapidly improving for our
| team. However, taking a quick look
at some of the other situations on
j some of the non-war fronts, it be
j comes obvious that things aren't
| going too well for all concerned, the
Japs and Germans for instance.
The soybean shortage which fol
lowed on the heels of a terrific ty
phoon may well cut Jap soybean
production in twain. Without soy
! beans the Japs may as well turn in
their sukiyaki bowls. The soybean
is to the Jap what wine, wimmen,
and song are to Stanford. Without
this small bean, the wheels of Jap
: industry will cease to turn, Jap
workers will starve, government
| will collapse, and the whole island
will revert to the silkworms. This
' situation will get even more tense
if the rice and fishhead crops fail.
| Tough typhoon, Tojo.
A late dispatch lrom Tass agency
claimed today that the German
economy is on the verge of collapse,
following the black potato short
| age, following on the heels of a
j severe cyclone, which may well cut
| potato production in twain. With
j out potatoes the Germans may as
| well turn in their beer steins. The
i potato is to the German what the
high collar is to Dr. Wilbur and
Herb Hoover. In short, it is the
staff of life. Without this large bean,
the wheels of German industry will
cease to turn, German workers will
starve, and Hitler will have to go
back to eating carpets. The whole
damn country will revert to the
I Lorelei. This situation will get even
| more tense if the hop crop stops.

A late dispatch from AP claimed
j today that the American economy

is on the verge of collapse as a result
of the cigarette shortage, which fol
lowed on the heels of the Novem
ber 7 landslide and may well cut
cigarette production in twain. With
out cigarettes the Americans may
as well turn in their lungs. The
cigarette is to the American what
gags are to the Chaparral. In short,
it is the staff of life. Without this
weed, the wheels oi American in
dustry will cease to turn, American
workers will get the d.t.s, the entire
populace will return to the snuff
box, and the whole country will re
vert to the buttalo, Mr. Chips. This
situation will get even more tense
if the marijuana and hashish crops
tail. And no more Dailies coming
out, yaaaaa!

Two prominent readers dropped
in yesterday. They said that they
had plenty of dope and wanted to
take the column over for once. When

here it is—hoping it does Chappie

It is becoming more and more ap
j parent that the situation on all
i fronts is rapidly improving for our
| team. However, taking a quick look
at some of the other situations on
j some of the non-war fronts, it be
j comes obvious that things aren't
| going too well for all concerned, the
Japs and Germans for instance.
The soybean shortage which fol
lowed on the heels of a terrific ty
phoon may well cut Jap soybean
production in twain. Without soy
! beans the Japs may as well turn in
their sukiyaki bowls. The soybean
is to the Jap what wine, wimmen,
and song are to Stanford. Without
this small bean, the wheels of Jap
: industry will cease to turn, Jap
workers will starve, government
| will collapse, and the whole island
will revert to the silkworms. This
' situation will get even more tense
if the rice and fishhead crops fail.

A late dispatch lrom Tass agency
claimed today that the German
economy is on the verge of collapse,
following the black potato short
| age, following on the heels of a
j severe cyclone, which may well cut
| potato production in twain. With
j out potatoes the Germans may as
| well turn in their beer steins. The
i potato is to the German what the
high collar is to Dr. Wilbur and
Herb Hoover. In short, it is the
staff of life. Without this large bean,
the wheels of German industry will
cease to turn, German workers will
starve, and Hitler will have to go
back to eating carpets. The whole
damn country will revert to the
I Lorelei. This situation will get even
| more tense if the hop crop stops.

A late dispatch from AP claimed

is on the verge of collapse as a result
of the cigarette shortage, which fol
lowed on the heels of the Novem

as well turn in their lungs. The
cigarette is to the American what
gags are to the Chaparral. In short,
it is the staff of life. Without this
weed, the wheels oi American in

workers will get the d.t.s, the entire
