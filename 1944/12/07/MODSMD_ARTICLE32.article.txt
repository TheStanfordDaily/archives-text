# Dowrie Says 'Must Pull Together' on Postwar Finance

(Editor's note: This is the eighth
in a scries of articles on the post
war world.)

"The United States is particularly
interested in the promotion of inter
national financial co-operation af
ter the war because our trade will
depend on it," said Dr. George W.
Dowrie, Professor of Finance in the
Graduate School of Business.
But workable arrangements de
pend on closely related world con
ditions, he believes. No great proj
ect for world financial co-operation
can succeed unless provisions are
made simultaneously for healthy
economic and political conditions.
Some persons advocate the post
ponement of financial co-operative
measure until such economic and
political security has been attained,
but it is not so much a matter of
horse and cart as it is a case of a
team of horses pulling together.
It has been proved that we cannot
work alone. "Everyone for him

self" has been a dismal failure. Now
while the world is enthusiastic and
wants to co-operate, we must launch
plans.for co-operative ventures.
America Undependahle
But the United States has a bad
reputation in such international
ventures. Too often we have spon
sored plans and then backed out at
the critical moment. Our represen
tatives have promised recklessly
without consulting leaders in and
out of Congress, and we have natu
rally rejected the unsatisfactory final
plan.
This time we must have a say as
to the plan being formulated, so that
when the final plan is presented, it
will be one that we can unhesitat
ingly ratify.
It is obvious that huge sums of
money will be needed by war-torn
countries for purposes of recon
struction and development. America
must be. the chief source of l'unds

for such enterprises, but neither our
; government nor our investors should
\ shoulder all the risk involved. We
| could refuse to make these loans on
the grounds that we need our capi
tal at home, but this would not be
a sound policy either from our own
selfish point of view or from that of
healthy international relations.
Sales Abroad
We need a prosperous foreign
market. We cannot maintain full
employment and adequate national
income unless we sell substantial
amounts of our products abroad.
Therefore it is both good business
and good foreign policy to see that
other countries get the capital they
need for their development.
How can we provide large sums
| to foreign borrowers and yet keep
! down the risk for our investors?
Bret ton Woods
In seeking an answer to that ques
j tion, the United States invited rep
resentatives of 44 countries to a
conference at Bretton Woods, New
Hampshire, in July 1944. From that
| Conference came a plan for two
great organizations.
First was the International Mone
tary Fund which has been discussed
more fully in the preceding article
of this series, and which is for the
benefit of short-term capital. It is
; mainly to stabilize international

I currency, and encourage the free
flow of international trade.
International Bank
Second was the International
Bank for Reconstruction and De
velopment to deal with long-term
j capital loans. It will have a capital
; of 10 billion dollars, of which the
I United States will contribute almost
a third. But the sum is not nearly
as staggering as it sounds, for only
! 20 per cent will be called in the be
j ginning, and of the remaining 80
! per cent only 1 per cent may be
| called in any one year to recover
j losses.
The Bank will first encourage pri
! vate loans by guaranteeing bor
rowers against loss. It will provide
loans from its own capital in cases
i where countries cannot get the
| money anywhere else at reasonable
, terms.
Bankers Protest
The main objections to the plan
j have come from bankers and the
I financial press. But it must be re
j membcred that they also fought our
national banking system, the Federal
Reserve type of central banking or
ganization, and federal insurance of
bank deposits.
One objccton is that the United
States will be supplying most of the
capital and might as well supply it
I all, thus keeping the job in the hands

lof the lending nation. Dr. Dowrie
emphasizes that this is the "each for
himself" policy which has already
failed so many times. Such a pro
cedure would give world co-opera -
i tion no chance.
A second objection is that some of
; the countries we regard as needy
have really made a large profit from
the war, and should use this rather
| than borrow. But Dr. Dowrie an
swers that this profit has only come
j to some countries, and even for these
! will not long suffice.
Varied Currency
A third objection is that three-
I fourths of the stock subscription
! payments can be made in a member
country's own currency which in
many cases is of questionable value.
But the great bulk of the money will
be s nd, and in ventures in world
wide co-operation we must accept
the best the several countries have
to oner.
Finally comes the fear that only
loans "not good enough" for regular
banking channels will go through
the World Bank. But the Bank has
no intention of taking "left-overs,"
emphasizes Dr. Dowrie. Their in
vestigations will be thorough, and
I they will service sound loans that
merely lack ready acceptability.
In a Bank owned by 44 or more
nations, both the responsibility and
the risk will be diffused.
