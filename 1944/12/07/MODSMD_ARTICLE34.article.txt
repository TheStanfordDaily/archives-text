# French Critic Tells Opinion Books, Nazis

### 
IMAGINARY INTERVIEWS — By
Andre Gidc (Alfred A. Knopf, $3).
This small book, now on sale at the
Bookstore—a collection of the recent
opinions of a famous French author,
is significant not only because it rep
resents Gide's decisive attitude about
modern French literature, but also
his equally decesive attitude about
modern French literature, but also
his equally decisive attitude about
the Nazi occupation of France.
Since all the articles in the hook
were written after the fall of
France, Gide uses literary criti
cism as a skillful and indirect
political criticism which could not
otherwise have been printed in
French newspapers without serious
consequcnees for the writer.
Good Translation
The translation is good, done by
a contemporary American poet, Mal
colm Cowley, and its clarity is espe
cially valuable in the discussions of
the use of the subjunctive and the
metrical accents in French poetry.
Besides (he imaginary interviews,
whose topics include Hemingway,
word distinction, modern art, the
novel form, and popular poetry,
the hook contains an introduction
to Goethe s dramatic works, and a

criticism of a book by Marc Char
don no, a French collaborationist
author, which is an implicit criti
cism of the man.
At the end, there are a few pages
from Gidc's journal, giving a small
but vivid picture of the deliverance
of Tunis, where he has been since
1942. Cowley has written a short
introduction, unusual in that it gives
concise philosophical as well as bio
graphical information about Gide.
Some of the interviews will be
interesting only to specialists in the
metrics and prosody of modern
French poetry, another only to dis
ciples of Goethe, but the whole
book has unusual interest for
everyone as a picture of a forth
right and conscientious critic, who
is as concerned about his country
as he is about its literature.
