# Introducing Snow King Candidates
## 
### T. Berry 
The Snow Ball, final semi-formal dance of
the season, packed and rolled by the Army
Student Council, will be thrown this Saturday
night from 9 to 1 in the Encina Pavilion to the
musci of the Shoemaker Field Band under the
baton of Dick Tauber.
Headlining the festivities will be the midnight
coronation of the Snow King, campus male of
outstanding attainments, who will be selected
during the dance by balloting of the dancers.
The Boys Themselves
And here they are: the formally announced
candidates for the Snow King with everything
worth knowing about them. Take your pick!
Ladies' Man
First on the list is William Snow, Arthur Hall,
whose academic major is electrical engineering,
and who is quite the ladies' man. Snow's cam
paign slogan is: "Snow for Snow King is even
more natural than Roosevelt for President!"
Sex is listed as his extracurricular activity at
Stanford (nice work), a football and basketball
player, his build is muscular, has brown eyes,
fair complexion, weighs 140, and has blond,
wavy hair.
Luke James Pitts, Cleveland Hall, hails from
Anaheim, California, his academic major is
engineering (are all these engineers good-look
ing?) has quite an established record in softball
(intramural) at Stanford, is a member of Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity, and is at present chairman
of executive committee of Cleveland Hall.
The vital statistics on this man are: hazel eyes,
ruddy complexion,' black wavy hair, age 22,
height nearly six feet (lacks little over inch),
with a magnificent build, and weighs on the
scales 165 pounds. Sold!
Oh, Those Engineers
The next slave, pardon, next contender for
the crown is Dick Fayram, who as the saying
goes needs no introduction. However, to you
uneducated people this man is the reason Stan
ford women buy war bonds, he hails from San
Leandro, California, hopes to be a mechanical
engineer, an excellent swimmer, member of
Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity, and represents
Washington Hall in the Snow King contest.
To give you some idea of what this fugitive
from a throne looks like we have the following
tabulated information: he is 23, 5 feet 10 inches
tall, weighs 170 pounds, has brown hair, blue
eyes, and a purple complexion to prove he is
a real blue-blood!
Harvey Caldon Small, another engineer (what
other courses do they offer here —do you have
to be handsome to get in?), represents Toyon
Hall in the Snow Ball coronation, hails from
Honolulu, is a track man, and is well known for
his appearance in "The over Road."
Maybe to women he is better known as the
hasher at Union, at any rate, a man who stands
an even six feet, weighs 160 pounds, has brown
hair, hazel eyes, and a fair complexion should
be known.
Sequoia Hall proudly presents as their can
didate for King, Tom Ashley, who hails from

San Diego. Now don't think this guy is an engi
neer top—because he is. He was a singer in
the Spring Show, president of Phi Psi, ex-stu
dent fireman, captain of Firehouse football team,
starred in baseball and football in High School,
was president of senior class in High School,
and is just an all-around BMOC.
Tom is a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
The vital statistics on Tom Ashley are: Height,
5 feet 10 inches; weight, 160; brown hair, hazel
eyes, dark complexion; build, sexy. Hmmmm.
A Soldier Bids
The next candidate is an AST candidate, but
I absolutely refuse to tell you what his major
is—we will just say that it is a military secret.
You can no doubt guess the academic major of
John H. G. Richards whose chief activity is be
ing a private in the U.S. Army. This man is a
member of the band, and a member of Co. A's
basketball team. Pvt. Richards hails from Berke
ley (we all know where that is). Dick stands
six feet tall (wearing one and one-half inch
stilts), weighs 155, has rusty hair, blue eyes,
and a ruddy complexion.
Tyler Hall presented its president, Jack Sie
mer, as candidate for King of the Snow Ball.
Jack blew in from San Anselmo, California,
formerly in the Navy V-12 at the Montana
School of Mines, and his academic major is
pre-med. (Doubtless he should have been an
engineer; how did he get in anyway?) The
measurements and stuff on this man are: height,
six feet plus one half inch; weight, 165; has
brown hair and blue eyes. His build is me
dium. His chances are good!
Campus Swingster
Jackie Herr, AST, pre-med, leader of the
famed "Dabblers in Swing," is from Sacra
mento, California, and is, quite naturally, a
member of the Stanford Band, and quite well
known to the frequenters of the Army Friday
Night all-campus dances throughout the past
two quarters.
Jackie has attended three universities be
sides Stanford, these being the University of
California at Berkeley, the University of Cali
fornia at Davis, and the John Tarleton College
at Stephenville, Texas.
Jack is a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho
Fraternity, and his athletic activities include
swimming, basketball, and track. Jackie Herr
is five feet and nine inches tall, weighs 145, has
brown hair, brown eyes, and a ruddy com
plexion.
A Reluctant AST
The last candidate is that reluctant AST, pre
med, Russell H. Toye, whose home is in Day
ton, Ohio. Russell lists his activities (all of
them) as a "hanger" and puts all his faith in
"hangers cream" that wonderful substance con
cocted in Dr. Ogg's chemistry class with the
aid of a cocktail shaker.
His motto: With "hangers cream" backing
me I can't miss! This man looks like the rep
resentative for the super-race, being a blue
eyed, blonde, light complexion, height five feet
ten inches, weight 160 pounds, and built like
that proverbial solid structure.
