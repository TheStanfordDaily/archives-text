# Here Are Your Stanford Snow Belles
## 
### 
Composing the Snow Court to surround the
King during the midnight coronation are sixteen
carefully selected Snow Belles from among the
loveliest of Stanford women. Here's a brief
sketch of the Snow Belles.
Winn Stratford, from Los Angeles, an angel,
she's lovely, she's lovely, she's lovely, she
doesn't use Ponds! Winn is a blueeyed blonde,
sophomore, nurse's aide, and a member of
Kappa Alpha Theta.
Betti Fraser, The Oaks, Pom-Pom Prom com
mittee, an art major who poses for own Petty
pictures, the perfect coed type, blonde, blue
eyed, petite, weighs 110 pounds, stands 5 feet
4 inches, and is nineteen years old.
Georgiana Patty, former "Chappie" gueen,
just as sweet as she looks and maybe sweeter.
She has wonderful blue eyes and is a "bawlout"
genius.
Barbara Upshaw, vice-president of A.S.S.U.,
secretary of Women's Conference, Excom, Delta
Gamma, all this and good-looking too!
Molly Shaw, Branner Hall belle, another
blonde, an aguatic star, has hazel eyes, and
weighs around 130.
Vee Hickman, The Chalet, Spring Show, and
member of Excom. In the sports line she likes
golfing and tennis.
Ruth Nyswander, another "Chappie" gueen,
is taking up social service. Ruth is 5 feet 7
inches tall, weight 120, has brown hair, blue
eyes, tan complexion, which all adds up to a
very alluring picture.

Ellen Ellery spent two semesters at Occiden
tal College before transferring to Stanford. At
Stanford she is a member of Orchesis, appeared
in "School for Husbands" during the spring
quarter, and is a member of Alpha Omicron Pi.
Vital statistics: hair — brown, eyes — brown,
complexion—fair, build—wheel
Shirley Pettit, Delta Gamma, business staff
of Daily, likes to swim and play basketball.
This girl is a blueeyed blonde, and we don't
mind admitting that she is beautiful.
Barbara Jean King, a King who is also a
queen, member of Kappa Kappa Gamma,
nurse's aide, major is pre-med (my, my!), an
other blonde, lias bluish-green eyes, and is 5
feet 4 inches tall.
Gail Irvine, hails from San Luis Obispo, hazel
eyes, brown hair, is a journalism major, and
interested in swimming and tennis in the sports
line. Gail is 5 feet and 6 inches tall and weighs
120 pounds.
Vivian Hypes, from Bell, California, which
makes her a typical selection for a Snow Belle
(we hope).
Dorothy Rieck, psychology major, member
of War Board, vicepresident and secretary of
Madrono.
Laura Supple, Roble Snow Belle, a City girl,
5 feet 7 inches tall, 120 pounds, and has brown
hair.
