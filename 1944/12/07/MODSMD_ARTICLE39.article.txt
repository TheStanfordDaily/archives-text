# Bandage Rollers Average 600 a Day
## 
### 
One of the most active of War
Board's committees throughout this
quarter has been the surgical dress
ings department, under the direction
of Marie Wagner.
Starting with an average of 600
dressings a day, the bandage rollers
worked up to a 900-bandage aver
age, slightly under the quota set for
Stanford, although allowance may
be made for time spent in instruc
tion.
Women have filled the Red Cross
room on the top floor of the Wom
en's Clubhouse Tuesday, Wednes
day, and Thursday of each week;
the program will be continued next
quarter.
Surgical dressings, going directly
to hospitals and war fronts, are a
vital material for war, Miss Wagner
said. All girls are asked to come
regularly to the surgical dressing
room at the times for which they
have sinned.
