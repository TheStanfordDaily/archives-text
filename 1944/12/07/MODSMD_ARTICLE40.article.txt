# Meet Dr. A.M. Espinosa 34 Years at Stanford
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
After 34 years of instruction, research, and leadership in the Stanford
community, Dr. Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa, for 14 years head of the
Romanic Languages Department, smilingly confesses that if lie were to
select a university all over again, at 28, he would still choose Stanford.
Throughout his years here, Dr. Espinosa has devoted a great proportion

of his time to research, particularly
in Spanish folklore and dialectology.
Having worked during the adminis
trations of all four of Stanford's
presidents, he expressed his appre
ciation for the time and individual
freedom that had always been al
lowed for research work in various
university fields.
| Author, Linguist
) Publications bearing Dr. Espino-
I sa's name—books, pamphlets and
| articles—have appeared in six coun
tries and three languages.
"I speak only four languages—
French, English, Italian, and Span
j ish," he said modestly, matter-of
factly, "but I read Latin, German,
■ Portuguese, a little Sanskrit . . ."
Spanish Majors Grow
j When the department began it.s
j autonomous existence, the propor
tion of Spanish majors as compared
to French was small, and advance
I work didn't amount to much. Span
ish majors increased until the out
break of the war; French was sur
passed by 1936, and "59 found French
majors in a decided minority.
Among the higher degrees given
! during the past 25 years, there have
been 88 Masters' in French, 104 in
1 Spanish; 12 French and 19 Spanish
j Ph.D.'s have been presented.
Oral Side of Learning
Of the 192 receiving Masters' de
grees, the majority are now high
school teachers or instructors in jun
ior colleges. University positions
are held by most of the doctors;
three are heads of departments in
other universities. As indicated by
statistics, most majors are training
for teaching.

In the summer before the war.
instructors from France and Spain j
came to Stanford as additions to the j
regular teaching stall's.
The department's teaching policy ,
has always stressed the oral side of
language learning; consequently,
with the advent of the war training
program at the Farm, conversion
was not difficult. In autumn and
winter quarters last year, 15 instruc
tors in French, Spanish and,Italian
were employed beyond the regular
staff in order to maintain three
classes of French for ASTP and one
for officers, three classes in Span
ish. seven Italian classes in autumn
and eleven in winter for the ASTP.
A new type of major within the
department—the regional major in
cluding geography- and history
classes—is being offered this year.
The bulk of the geography work is
given under Professor Ronald Hil
ton. Six students are this year en- !
listed under this major.
Other changes within the depart
ment include additional stress on
oral work, and the abolition of the
teaching assistant system. Whereas
formerly seniors, Masters' and Ph.D.
candidates taught classes, even the
elementary classes are now taught
by well-trained instructors.
In 1923 and '24, Dr. Fspinosa was
president of the American Folklore
Society. In addition, he was a cor
responding member of the Royal I
Spanish Academy and of the Real j
Academia Hispano - Americana de
Ciencias y Artes. He holds the title
of Comendador con Placa de la Real
Olden de Isabel la Catolica.
Dr. Espinosa predicts increasing
interest in South America after the
war, since there has been a marked
tendency toward the democratic
way of life in past years.
Because of the limitless national
resources and the relatively unex
plored commercial opportunities in
South America, much of our mate
rial and commercial expansion in
years to come will be directed to the
south, he said. The importance of
language in this development can
not be overlooked.
Even while Herbert Hoover was
yet Secretary of Commerce, he said
prophetically that Spanish has an
importance in this continent second
only to English.
