# War Board Statement
## 
### 
Today the United States is going into its fourth year of the
second World War, and it is time for us to stop and consider,
not as Stanford students but as Americans, whether or not we
' have sincerely done all in our power to back our armed serv
j ices.
Our contribution must be more than merely writing on a
war work sheet everything that we have done in the past week
which might be classified as war work.
Instead, at the beginning of each week we must set aside a
time to do something which will directly aid the war effort and
we must at all times help the government by observing wartime
I regulations and buying war stamps each week. These things
I are small and cannot be called "sacrifices," yet they are neces
: sary if we are to finish this war before another three years have
passed.
On December 7, Japan is launching a "Crush America" pro
gram, which the Japanese civilians will do all in their power to
carry out. What are we going to do to show our men that we
can give them as strong support as the Japanese will give their
I army and navy?
I am confident that we can outdo their effort if we remember
that they will be working at a time when we are apt to be lax;
that is, during the Christmas season. When we go home for
j vacation, we cannot use our two hours of war work a week dur
ing the quarter as an excuse for saying "I'm entitled to a rest,
I've done my part," for when we examine our consciences we
will see that no one of us has contributed as much as he could.
War Board appreciates the interest of those students who
have given us constructive criticism, for the War Board is a stu
dent association and can succeed only as long as it has the sug
gestions and aid of the campus as a whole.
Direct criticisms founded on fact, and the wholehearted back
ing of the student body will enable us to improve our organiza
tion in future quarters.
Some Stanford students have done as much to further our
war effort as was possible under present War Board. But
there are many who have shown little interest in making a con
tribution. Only twice during the past quarter has any living
group had every member doing his pledged two hours of work.
This shows that many of us have given our part of the burden
to someone else. We must work for the time when every student
will do his part. To those who have sincerely done theirs, we
give our thanks.
