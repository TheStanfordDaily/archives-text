# Autumn Quarter War Board Activities Summarized
## S.W.B. Seeks Student Aid in War Work 
### 
Stanford War Board, winding up its Autumn quarter, has released ;»
summary of work covered by its committees—work done by Stanford stu
dents helping to fight the war far from the front lines.
War Board itself was first organized as a standard committee of Excom
in February of 1942 in an effort to coordinate campus wartime activities

and to present to the University an
intelligent, efficient war program.
In a Daily article earlier this quar
ter, present WB Coordinator Jcan
nette Grimsley stated that "the War
Board was not set up as a separate
activity or committee . . . Our work
is only as important as each student
makes it by his co-operation and
realization of our aims."
The WB Coordinator today serves
as an ex-officio member of ex-com
mittee and Cardinals, has contact
with administrative offices and with
the YWCA, the Daily, the WAA, the
Army representatives, and many
other campus agencies.
This quarter's War Board, headed
by Miss Grimsley, and with the ad
dition of Men's Coordinator Milton
Levy, consists of 11 committees:
Blood Bank, directed by Coot Cof
fin; Crop Crew, Helen Gilson; Aux
iliary, Mary Lou Patton; Salvage,
Breen Ratterman and Quincy Brown;
Stamps and Bonds, Dorothy Rieck;
Posters, Dorothy Taggart; Surgical
Dressings, Marie Wagner; U. S. O.,
Lucy Vance; War Work Hours,
Jackie Cannon; Office, Carol Kel
logg, and Knitting, Pat Meyer and
Emily Metzger.
