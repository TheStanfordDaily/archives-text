# Girls Serve Lunch Tea at Allied Arts
## 
### 
Newest committee of War Board
Allied Arts, began functioning
summer quarter to procure Stan
ford women for serving Saturday
luncheon and tea at the Allied Arts
Guild in Menlo Park.
Al! profits from the Guild arc
given to the Stanford Convalescent
Home and time spent serving by
Stanford girls may be counted as
war work.
The committee, beaded autumn
quarter by Barbara Bcardslee, will
continue its program this winter.
