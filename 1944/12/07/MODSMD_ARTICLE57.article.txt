# Outstanding Players Named On Mural All-Star Squads
## 
### GORDON LEVY MORT COHEN 
Claiming three first-string berths,
the champion Arguello A. A. grid
I squad dominates the Daily's mythical
j all-star team of League 11. One man
| apiece was placed on the team by
1 the Med. School, Firehouse, and Dee
Gee Hashers to round out the com
bination. Here is the formidable six
as picked by the Daily staff of ex
perts:
End—Joe Pickering (Arguello)
End Phil Lee (Med. School)
Center—Bob Abrams (Arguello)
Quarterback—Jim Bradshaw, captain
(Arguello)
Half—Tom Ashley (Firehouse)
This imposing list of stars does not
go without a bit of explanation in
behalf of the choices. The end posts
were garnered by two stalwarts on
defense throughout the entire season.
Joe Pickering, noted for his hard
charging and vicious blocking, could
i not be overlooked by the selectors.
Neither could Phil Lee's all-around
playing ability, which displayed some
! great defensive work, be forgotten
when giving proper recognition.
Abrams at Center
No other center in the league could
compare with Arguello's Bob
Abrams, easily the hardest-charging
lineman seen in action. "Abe's" of
| fensive blocking and his powerful
i tactics on defense made him a
marked man in ' each opponent's
backfield.
Tom Ashley, leader of the Fire
house gang, grabbed a first-string
halfback spot by virtue of his siz
zling offensive talent, which was seen
!in his spectacular pass-catching.
Ashley's hard-fighting spirit kept the
I Firemen serious contenders to the
t very end.
Don Landale, the Dee Gees' good
back, grabbed the other half post
| after a close vote. Heads-up football
and his triple threat abilities gave
| Landale the nod.
Bradshaw Captain
Probably the easiest choice on the
entire squad put Jim Bradshaw at
! quarter, and he couldn't be denied
honorary captainship of the team.
Working from the "T" formation
j with excellence, Bradshaw held the
Arguello team together and used his
! defensive ability to the best advan
tage. A shifty runner and a triple
i threat once he had the ball, Brad
shaw was the championship spark of
his title team.
The staff of experts flipped coin
: after coin before they came up with
1 this second team:
End—Tom Egan (Tyler)
End—Motley Thompson (Arguello)
Center —Bob Howell (Firehouse)
Quarter — Norm Christiansen (Med.
School)
Half—P. G. Lee (Gerona)
Half—Joe Sher (Doe Gees)
Egan, a regular backfield man, was
placed at end because of his superb
handling of passes throughout the
season.
Honorable mention — Ends: Hall
(Toyon), Luce (Dee Gees), and
Forbes (Gerona). Center: Hanlon
(Gerona). Backs: Brown (Washing
ton), Castle (Washington), Rosburg
(Gerona), Levy (Arguello), Jen
nings (Arguello), Supple (Dee Gees),
Davis (Tyler) and Fox (Tyler).

The season's over; finals are about
!<> start, and all that is left is the
annual Intramural Team. This year,
as always, the race for the different
positions was close, but there were
outstanding players. This is our
choice for League I:
End—Dave Blown. Capt. (Nu Sig
[ ma Nu)
*
End—Gordy Pyles (Co. "C")
Center-—Bob Morris (Med. I)
Back—Bud Riehter (Buchanan)
Back—Jack Heald (Nu Simga Nu)
Back—Marty Bauman (Encina)
The men most able to fill the end
positions were never in doubt after
the first lew games: Dave Brown and
Gordy Pyles were always standouts.
Brown, the captain of the All Intra
mural team, was an all-Coast end
and former Stanford star. His great
pass-catching ability and fine defen
sive play made him everybody's
choice. For consistent play, Gordy
Pyles is also a unanimous choice for
the other end position. He was the
mainstay of the powerful Co. "C"
team and led them to many wins. He
was tall and fast and a stalwart on
I defense as well.
j Morris Versatile
Probably the most versatile man
on the team is Bob Morris. He could
play any position equally well; was
fast and tricky; was a good passer,
and was an above-average center.
On defense, he backed up the line
and made many almost impossible
saves.
In the backfield, where the compe
tition was much keener, are Jack
Heald, Bud Riehter and Marty Bau
man. Heald was the passer "par
excellence" of League I. His passes
were fast and led his men beauti
fully; very seldom were they inter
cepted. The top scorer of the Bear
cats and one of the most dangerous
men on the field was But Riehter.
Although he played most of the sea
son at the end position, his oppo
nents found that he could run and
pass as well as do everything else.
He scored on the average of at least
one touchdown a game and was also
brilliant on defense. Bauman was the
top man of a better-than-average
Flyer team. His duties consisted of
passing, running and playing safety
position. To him goes much of the
credit for the fine showing of his
team. He was also instrumental in
handing Nu Sigma Nu their only de
feat of the season.
Second Team
Here is the second team:
End—Hugh Cox (Arthur)
End—Bob Stoller (Co. "C")

Honorable mention: Ted Farrell

Lon Pierce (Toyon), Ed Maher
(Arthur).

Bradshaw Captain
Probably the easiest choice on the
entire squad put Jim Bradshaw at
! quarter, and he couldn't be denied
honorary captainship of the team.
Working from the "T" formation

Arguello team together and used his

The staff of experts flipped coin

End—Tom Egan (Tyler)
End—Motley Thompson (Arguello)
Center —Bob Howell (Firehouse)
Quarter — Norm Christiansen (Med.
School)
Half—P. G. Lee (Gerona)
Half—Joe Sher (Doe Gees)
Egan, a regular backfield man, was
placed at end because of his superb
handling of passes throughout the
season.
Honorable mention — Ends: Hall
(Toyon), Luce (Dee Gees), and
Forbes (Gerona). Center: Hanlon
(Gerona). Backs: Brown (Washing
ton), Castle (Washington), Rosburg
(Gerona), Levy (Arguello), Jen
nings (Arguello), Supple (Dee Gees),
Davis (Tyler) and Fox (Tyler).

The season's over; finals are about
!<> start, and all that is left is the
annual Intramural Team. This year,
as always, the race for the different
positions was close, but there were
outstanding players. This is our
choice for League I:
End—Dave Blown. Capt. (Nu Sig
[ ma Nu)
*
End—Gordy Pyles (Co. "C")
Center-—Bob Morris (Med. I)
Back—Bud Riehter (Buchanan)
Back—Jack Heald (Nu Simga Nu)
Back—Marty Bauman (Encina)
The men most able to fill the end
positions were never in doubt after
the first lew games: Dave Brown and
Gordy Pyles were always standouts.
Brown, the captain of the All Intra
mural team, was an all-Coast end
and former Stanford star. His great
pass-catching ability and fine defen
sive play made him everybody's
choice. For consistent play, Gordy
Pyles is also a unanimous choice for
the other end position. He was the
mainstay of the powerful Co. "C"
team and led them to many wins. He
was tall and fast and a stalwart on
I defense as well.
j Morris Versatile
Probably the most versatile man
on the team is Bob Morris. He could
play any position equally well; was
fast and tricky; was a good passer,
and was an above-average center.
On defense, he backed up the line
and made many almost impossible
saves.
In the backfield, where the compe
tition was much keener, are Jack
Heald, Bud Riehter and Marty Bau
man. Heald was the passer "par
excellence" of League I. His passes
were fast and led his men beauti
fully; very seldom were they inter
cepted. The top scorer of the Bear
cats and one of the most dangerous
men on the field was But Riehter.
Although he played most of the sea
son at the end position, his oppo
nents found that he could run and
pass as well as do everything else.
He scored on the average of at least
one touchdown a game and was also
brilliant on defense. Bauman was the
top man of a better-than-average
Flyer team. His duties consisted of
passing, running and playing safety
position. To him goes much of the
credit for the fine showing of his
team. He was also instrumental in
handing Nu Sigma Nu their only de
feat of the season.

placed at end because of his superb
handling of passes throughout the
season.
Honorable mention — Ends: Hall
(Toyon), Luce (Dee Gees), and
Forbes (Gerona). Center: Hanlon
(Gerona). Backs: Brown (Washing
ton), Castle (Washington), Rosburg
(Gerona), Levy (Arguello), Jen
nings (Arguello), Supple (Dee Gees),
Davis (Tyler) and Fox (Tyler).

The season's over; finals are about
!<> start, and all that is left is the
annual Intramural Team. This year,
as always, the race for the different
positions was close, but there were
outstanding players. This is our
choice for League I:
End—Dave Blown. Capt. (Nu Sig
[ ma Nu)
*
End—Gordy Pyles (Co. "C")
Center-—Bob Morris (Med. I)
Back—Bud Riehter (Buchanan)
Back—Jack Heald (Nu Simga Nu)
Back—Marty Bauman (Encina)
The men most able to fill the end
positions were never in doubt after
the first lew games: Dave Brown and
Gordy Pyles were always standouts.
Brown, the captain of the All Intra
mural team, was an all-Coast end
and former Stanford star. His great
pass-catching ability and fine defen
sive play made him everybody's
choice. For consistent play, Gordy
Pyles is also a unanimous choice for
the other end position. He was the
mainstay of the powerful Co. "C"
team and led them to many wins. He
was tall and fast and a stalwart on
I defense as well.
j Morris Versatile
Probably the most versatile man
on the team is Bob Morris. He could
play any position equally well; was
fast and tricky; was a good passer,
and was an above-average center.
On defense, he backed up the line
and made many almost impossible
saves.
In the backfield, where the compe
tition was much keener, are Jack
Heald, Bud Riehter and Marty Bau
man. Heald was the passer "par
excellence" of League I. His passes
were fast and led his men beauti
fully; very seldom were they inter
cepted. The top scorer of the Bear
cats and one of the most dangerous
men on the field was But Riehter.
Although he played most of the sea
son at the end position, his oppo
nents found that he could run and
pass as well as do everything else.
He scored on the average of at least
one touchdown a game and was also
brilliant on defense. Bauman was the
top man of a better-than-average
Flyer team. His duties consisted of
passing, running and playing safety
position. To him goes much of the
credit for the fine showing of his
team. He was also instrumental in
handing Nu Sigma Nu their only de
feat of the season.
Second Team
Here is the second team:
End—Hugh Cox (Arthur)
End—Bob Stoller (Co. "C")
Center—Pete Elliot (Co. "C")
Back—Charlie Clark (Sequoia)

Honorable mention: Ted Farrell

Tom Steege (Buchanan), Don Prince
(Buchanan), Jerry Goss (Toyon),
Lon Pierce (Toyon), Ed Maher
(Arthur).
Claiming three first-string berths,
the champion Arguello A. A. grid
I squad dominates the Daily's mythical
j all-star team of League 11. One man
| apiece was placed on the team by
1 the Med. School, Firehouse, and Dee
Gee Hashers to round out the com
bination. Here is the formidable six
as picked by the Daily staff of ex
perts:
End—Joe Pickering (Arguello)
End Phil Lee (Med. School)
Center—Bob Abrams (Arguello)
Quarterback—Jim Bradshaw, captain
(Arguello)
Half—Tom Ashley (Firehouse)
This imposing list of stars does not
go without a bit of explanation in
behalf of the choices. The end posts
were garnered by two stalwarts on
defense throughout the entire season.
Joe Pickering, noted for his hard
charging and vicious blocking, could
i not be overlooked by the selectors.
Neither could Phil Lee's all-around
playing ability, which displayed some
! great defensive work, be forgotten
when giving proper recognition.
Abrams at Center
No other center in the league could
compare with Arguello's Bob
Abrams, easily the hardest-charging
lineman seen in action. "Abe's" of
| fensive blocking and his powerful
i tactics on defense made him a
marked man in ' each opponent's
backfield.
Tom Ashley, leader of the Fire
house gang, grabbed a first-string
halfback spot by virtue of his siz
zling offensive talent, which was seen
!in his spectacular pass-catching.
Ashley's hard-fighting spirit kept the
I Firemen serious contenders to the
t very end.
Don Landale, the Dee Gees' good
back, grabbed the other half post
| after a close vote. Heads-up football
and his triple threat abilities gave
| Landale the nod.
Bradshaw Captain
Probably the easiest choice on the
entire squad put Jim Bradshaw at
! quarter, and he couldn't be denied
honorary captainship of the team.
Working from the "T" formation
j with excellence, Bradshaw held the
Arguello team together and used his
! defensive ability to the best advan
tage. A shifty runner and a triple
i threat once he had the ball, Brad
shaw was the championship spark of
his title team.

sive play made him everybody's
choice. For consistent play, Gordy
Pyles is also a unanimous choice for
the other end position. He was the
mainstay of the powerful Co. "C"
team and led them to many wins. He
was tall and fast and a stalwart on
I defense as well.
j Morris Versatile
Probably the most versatile man
on the team is Bob Morris. He could
play any position equally well; was
fast and tricky; was a good passer,
and was an above-average center.
On defense, he backed up the line
and made many almost impossible
saves.
In the backfield, where the compe
tition was much keener, are Jack
Heald, Bud Riehter and Marty Bau
man. Heald was the passer "par
excellence" of League I. His passes
were fast and led his men beauti
fully; very seldom were they inter
cepted. The top scorer of the Bear
cats and one of the most dangerous
men on the field was But Riehter.
Although he played most of the sea
son at the end position, his oppo
nents found that he could run and
pass as well as do everything else.
He scored on the average of at least
one touchdown a game and was also
brilliant on defense. Bauman was the
top man of a better-than-average
Flyer team. His duties consisted of
passing, running and playing safety
position. To him goes much of the
credit for the fine showing of his
team. He was also instrumental in
handing Nu Sigma Nu their only de
feat of the season.
