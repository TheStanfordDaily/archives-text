## 1944 Mural Football Season Comes to Close 
### DICK JENNINGS 
The fall intramural football sea
son blazed to a close Tuesday as
the Arguello A. A. grabbed the
championship laurels over the heads
of fifteen other fighting sextets. The
touch-tackle games, while scarcely
substituting for intercollegiate ath
letics, were successful in reviving a
touch of the ol' Stanford gridiron
file among the hundred - odd
"roughs" who took part in the pro
ceedings. Coaches Bugge and
Mumby expressed their approval of
the season, which was character
ized by fast, high-scoring battles and
sensational upsets.
Openers Good Preview
The league openers, played amid
November showers, offered a good
preview of things to come, for Co.
"C." the League I power, crushed the
Buchanan Bearcats cats 13-7, and
Arguello slapped a repeat on appa
Dee Gees 26-7. Gerona and Fire
house started on the victory trail,
as did Med !I and the Encina Fly
ers. Med 111 and Med I fought it
out to a 14-14 stalemate which was
to knock them both out of the
League I championship race.
The second round of tussles left
only Co. "C," Arguello, and Fire
house undefeated, while Gerona,
Encina, and Arthur joined the ranks
of the once-beaten, and Washing
ton and Toyons North and South
sank lower into the mire of defeat.
The Kappa Dee Gees struck back
with a vengeance against Tyler, 34-
6. This general trend of things con
tinued the next Tuesday as Co. "C"
slaughtered Arthur 40-0 and Kappa
Dee Gees walked away from Wash
ington 29-6. The fighting Firehouse
squad, after squeezing past a strong
Gerona outfit, succumbed to the
indefatigable Arguello boys 7-6,
which left Arguello the only unde
feated team in League 11. ffi
League 1 Struggle
Meanwhile, a struggle for the
League I championship seemed emi
nent between Med 111, led by Brown
and Heald. and Co. "C," sparked by
lanky end Gordon Pyles, as these
teams continued their steamroller
drives. Encina got knocked out of
the running by Buchanan, who were
beginning to roll after their first de
feats.
Med I suffered their first defeat
at the hands of Co. "C," 6-2, in the
fourth round of play, in which Med
111 strengthened their title hopes
with an impressive 18-0 win over

Buchanan. While this maddening
battle for the League I crown was
going on, Arguello A. A. and Jim
Bradshaw continued to bewilder
their opponents with a combination
of speed and power that downed
Med II. 7-6. Tyler upset a weak
ened Firehouse team in another 7-6
contest that definitely cooked the
smoke-eaters' goose, and Gerona
A. C. also took it on the chin from
the Dee Gees. Washington and Se
quoia got a thrill out of beating
Arthur and the Towon Dead-End
ers, 2-0 and 13-2 respectively.
Encina Whips Med III
As the season reached its crucial
phase, the Encina Flyers arose from
their lethargy and slapped down
the powerful Med III bunch in one
ol the season's greatest upsets; al
though trailing between halves, the
Flyers slugged over two tallies in
the second period against the sur
prised Meds. Arguello squeezed
past Tyler, 18-6. but almost dropped
the game due to the pass-snagging
of Tommy Eagan. Buchanan got on
the ball again by whipping the
Toyon Operators 28-7, and Kappa
Dee Gees stayed in the League II
second place position by a victory
over the Dead-Enders.
Champs Upset
In the sixth round of games, Co.
"C" and Arguello A. A. clinched
their titles of Leagues I and II by
massacring the Encina Flyers, 13-6,
and Washington, 24-0, and prepared
for the climax of a perfect season.
However, the high-riding champs
neglected to watch the sinister Ge
rona and Med III squads, who were
collecting unnoticed victories. The
blows fell on black December 1, when
the inspired Gerona congregation
short-passed to a 14-13 victory over
Arguello, and Co. "C" fell to the
Nu Sigma Nu's (Med III) to the
tune of 19-18, in probably the hard
est-fought fracas of the year. These
upsets had no influence on the
League championship play-offs, for
the Meds had lost one and tied one,
and Gerona had dropped two.
The 1944 Big Game took place
Tuesday on the obscure practice
field, where Arguello, cheered on
| by a dozen or so enthusiasts, un
leashed a tremendous attack on Co.
"C"; the soldiers were taken by a
31-7 score, and the season passed
on into sporting history.
