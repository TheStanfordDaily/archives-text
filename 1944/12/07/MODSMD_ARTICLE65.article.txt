# Xmas Chappie On the Way
## 
### THE OLD BOY 
"Only eight more days till Chappie!" So stated Henrietta Nussbaum,
Daily reporter, when interviewed by the Old Boy yesterday afternoon.
"The December Chaparral is going to be real peachy," she continued,
"and will feature piles of cartoons, jokes, stories and other goodies. I plan
on buying thirty or forty copies to send to friends and former Stanford

'students in the service."
Henrietta, who was discovered by
the Old Boy under a pile of sawdust
at Belt's, further explained that there
would be a full page of cartoons by
managing editor, Dick Fayram, and a
whole slough of them by Dick Dris
coll, who will be Old Boy next
quarter.
"I want my friends to know that
the December Chappie is just bub
bling over with sex and stuff like
that there," she said.
When asked about the prospects
of another story by Rene Zentner,
Miss Nussbaum confided that Zent
ner has written a very unusual
Christmas tale in the spirit of the
Christmas Carol and that anybody
who wants to reminisce over his
childhood Christmases should read
the story three or four times.
Henrietta admitted, after being
i bribed with a few quarts of b r
that the Christmas Chappie will be
32 pages, bigger and better than ever,
and that the mag will sell for the
new low price of 25 cents.
The interview was concluded when
Henrietta suddenly rushed out to
the press chanting the Bosnian mad
rigal:
"It'll make the Old Boy happy
It you buy a Christmas Chappie!"
