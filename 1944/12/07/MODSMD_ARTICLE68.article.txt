# 'Omar Khayyam's' Chej Gives Secrets of Trade
## 
### 
George Mardikian, widely known
chef and proprietor of the famed
"Omar Khayyam's Restaurant" in
San Francisco, will come to Stanford
tomorrow to speak at the Women's
Clubhouse from 3 to 5 in the after
noon. Students who have bought his
new book, "Dinner at Omar Khay
yam's," may have their copies auto
graphed by Mr. Mardikian after his
informal talk.
Of many people who have met and
spoken to him, all are impressed "by
his unbounded enthusiasm for the
United States, a patriotism that
amounts almost to a religion."
Mrs. Helen Stirling, head of the
j book department of the Stanford
I Bookstore, which is handling Mr.

Mardikian's book, said he is "a de- j
lightful speaker, with a slight, pleas- I
ing Armenian accent."
As is not unusual in foreigners I
who are grateful to the United States,
Mr. Mardikian is helping others
share the success he has earned in
this country. He is establishing an
unusual competitive scholarship for
students at the Armenian Junior
College in Beirut, Lebanon, to study
at an American college. He has said \
that he will pay all traveling ex- '
penses to the United States, and also j
living expenses up to $1,500 a year i
for four years to any student who j
wins the scholarship.
Remarking that most foreigners j
waste too much time when they j
come to this country by not learn- |
ing the language, Mr. Mardikian j
stipulates that the winner of his j
scholarship must learn English here, j
Another specification made by Mr. j
Mardikian is that the student, may |
not study medicine, dentistry or law,
since there are already too many J
members of these professions in j
Beirut.
Mr. Mardikian is a well-known I
radio and magazine personality, hav- j
ing appeared on three different na
tional hookups, and has been "writ- j
ten up" in "Look" magazine for No
vember 18, 1944, and in the "Ameri- j
can Weekly" of December 8, 1944.
