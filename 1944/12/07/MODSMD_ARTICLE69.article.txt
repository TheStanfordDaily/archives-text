# Hoover War Tower Inspired By Cathedral Architecture
## 
### GLORIA BROOKS 
Rising from the surrounding low,
; red-tiled Romanesque buildings like
an obelisk from the desert, the Hoo
ver Library of War, Revolution and
Peace is a 270-foot high architectural
landmark of Stanford.
From many miles away you can
see this tower which was designed
by Arthur Brown Jr., a Scifi Fran
cisco architect, who also did the
Tower of the Sun at Treasure Island.
Its dominant feature is its 14-story
shaft crowned by a belvedere and
surrounded on all sides by low wings.
The inspiration for the design, which
combines Byzantine and Roman
esque styles, was taken from the
Cathedrals of Salamanca and Mex
ico City.
Dedicated to Hoover Collection
Upon entering the monumental
! 40-foot square entrance hall you see
j inscribed on the opposite wall the
| dedication of the library to "the use
! and preservation of books and manu
j scripts on war, revolution, and peace
| gathered by Herbert Hoover. The
many contributors to the Hoover Li
brary fund are also listed on an
other wall. Off the entrance hall to
[ the right and left are the public
exhibition rooms, and farther back
are the offices of the directors and
the Ray Lyman Wilbur Collection
on the Social Problems of the United
States. The small reading room and
the conference room to the left have
become the headquarters of the Civil
Affairs Training School.
On the second floor you find many
i small research rooms, then story
j after story of library stacks, six
floors of which are completely filled
at present. The Hoover archives are
located on the ninth and tenth floors,
while Mr. Hoover and Dr. Wilbur
have offices on the eleventh, and
Dr. Lutz's office is on the twelfth.
Carillon Donated by Belgians
Tine famous carillon, which occu
pies the thirteenth and fourteenth
floors of the tower, was given to
| Stanford in 1!)40 by the Belgian
| American Educational Foundation at
the close of the New York World's
| Fair after being exhibited in the
! Belgian Favillion. Tht.'t are 35 bells,

the largest weighing 15.000 pounds
in this set which was cast in Tour
nai, Belgium. One bell bears the in
scription in Latin: "Because I am
Leopold. I ring only for peace over
the Atlantic."
The carilloneur who plays the in
tricate keyboard so skillfully each
day is James Lawson, a graduate
student. He came back here to play
these bells after practice as assistant
carilloneur at the Rockefeller Me
morial Chapel of the University of
Chicago.
Old With New In Tapestries
There are five Belgian tapestries
which were donated by the Belgian
Commission also, following the New
York Fair. They are extremely in
teresting, as they are an experiment
in carrying out a modern painting
in the old technique of tapestry.
Dealing with Belgian-American re
lations, these tapestries are entitled:
'American-Belgian Relations," "Dis
covery and Colonization of New
York by Belgium," "Work of Bel
gian Missionaries i . America," "Old
Belgium," and "New Belgium."
The tower construction is designed
for the purposes of special research
rather than for a general library
where large numbers of people can
be accommodated, according to Har
old Fish, vice-chairman of the direc
tors. Its many valuable collections
are of primary interest to specialists
in such fields as international rela
tions, history, economics and gov
ernment.
For Research Only
"The majority of the materials are
of value only to research workers
who have done work in a particular
field and who can use foreign lan
guages," Professor Fish stated. As
illustration he told of the famous
Italian historian, Professor Salve
mini, who found material here that
couldn't be duplicated elsewhere in
the world outside certain libraries in
Italy and, in one case, a library in
Florence.
He also told of just receiving a
telegram from Dorothy Thompson
asking for photostats of articles in a
certain magazine published in
Czechoslovakia and available in this

| country only in the Hoover Library.
The small staff and limited space
make it impossible for the library to
take care of many users at one time.
However, books there which are in
demand by some class are put on
reserve in the regular library. The
Hoover Library contains many books
which may be found in other large
libraries specializing in international
relations, history, or economics of the
Twentieth century.
The Civil Affairs Officers use the
library mainly for conferences and
for reading and study related to their
j courses. One reason Stanford was
I chosen as one of the six universities
for this program was because of the
Hoover Library and the number of
faculty experts in the fields of civil
affairs training.

From many miles away you can
see this tower which was designed
by Arthur Brown Jr., a Scifi Fran

surrounded on all sides by low wings.
The inspiration for the design, which
combines Byzantine and Roman

many contributors to the Hoover Li

[ the right and left are the public
exhibition rooms, and farther back
are the offices of the directors and
the Ray Lyman Wilbur Collection
on the Social Problems of the United

Carillon Donated by Belgians
Tine famous carillon, which occu
pies the thirteenth and fourteenth
floors of the tower, was given to
| Stanford in 1!)40 by the Belgian
| American Educational Foundation at
the close of the New York World's
| Fair after being exhibited in the
! Belgian Favillion. Tht.'t are 35 bells,

the largest weighing 15.000 pounds
in this set which was cast in Tour
nai, Belgium. One bell bears the in
scription in Latin: "Because I am
Leopold. I ring only for peace over
the Atlantic."
The carilloneur who plays the in
tricate keyboard so skillfully each
day is James Lawson, a graduate
student. He came back here to play
these bells after practice as assistant
carilloneur at the Rockefeller Me
morial Chapel of the University of
Chicago.
Old With New In Tapestries
There are five Belgian tapestries
which were donated by the Belgian
Commission also, following the New
York Fair. They are extremely in
teresting, as they are an experiment
in carrying out a modern painting
in the old technique of tapestry.
Dealing with Belgian-American re
lations, these tapestries are entitled:
'American-Belgian Relations," "Dis
covery and Colonization of New
York by Belgium," "Work of Bel
gian Missionaries i . America," "Old
Belgium," and "New Belgium."
The tower construction is designed
for the purposes of special research
rather than for a general library
where large numbers of people can
be accommodated, according to Har
old Fish, vice-chairman of the direc
tors. Its many valuable collections
are of primary interest to specialists
in such fields as international rela
tions, history, economics and gov
ernment.
For Research Only
"The majority of the materials are
of value only to research workers
who have done work in a particular
field and who can use foreign lan
guages," Professor Fish stated. As

teresting, as they are an experiment
in carrying out a modern painting
in the old technique of tapestry.
Dealing with Belgian-American re
lations, these tapestries are entitled:
'American-Belgian Relations," "Dis
covery and Colonization of New
York by Belgium," "Work of Bel
gian Missionaries i . America," "Old
Belgium," and "New Belgium."
The tower construction is designed
for the purposes of special research
rather than for a general library
where large numbers of people can
be accommodated, according to Har
old Fish, vice-chairman of the direc
tors. Its many valuable collections
are of primary interest to specialists
in such fields as international rela
tions, history, economics and gov
ernment.
For Research Only
"The majority of the materials are
of value only to research workers
who have done work in a particular
field and who can use foreign lan
guages," Professor Fish stated. As
illustration he told of the famous
Italian historian, Professor Salve
mini, who found material here that
couldn't be duplicated elsewhere in
the world outside certain libraries in
Italy and, in one case, a library in
Florence.
He also told of just receiving a
telegram from Dorothy Thompson
asking for photostats of articles in a
certain magazine published in
Czechoslovakia and available in this

| country only in the Hoover Library.
The small staff and limited space
make it impossible for the library to
take care of many users at one time.
However, books there which are in
demand by some class are put on
reserve in the regular library. The
Hoover Library contains many books
which may be found in other large
libraries specializing in international
relations, history, or economics of the
Twentieth century.
The Civil Affairs Officers use the
library mainly for conferences and
for reading and study related to their
j courses. One reason Stanford was
I chosen as one of the six universities
for this program was because of the
Hoover Library and the number of
faculty experts in the fields of civil
affairs training.
Rising from the surrounding low,
; red-tiled Romanesque buildings like
an obelisk from the desert, the Hoo
ver Library of War, Revolution and
Peace is a 270-foot high architectural
landmark of Stanford.
From many miles away you can
see this tower which was designed
by Arthur Brown Jr., a Scifi Fran
cisco architect, who also did the
Tower of the Sun at Treasure Island.
Its dominant feature is its 14-story
shaft crowned by a belvedere and
surrounded on all sides by low wings.
The inspiration for the design, which
combines Byzantine and Roman
esque styles, was taken from the
Cathedrals of Salamanca and Mex
ico City.
Dedicated to Hoover Collection
Upon entering the monumental
! 40-foot square entrance hall you see
j inscribed on the opposite wall the
| dedication of the library to "the use
! and preservation of books and manu
j scripts on war, revolution, and peace
| gathered by Herbert Hoover. The
many contributors to the Hoover Li
brary fund are also listed on an
other wall. Off the entrance hall to
[ the right and left are the public
exhibition rooms, and farther back
are the offices of the directors and
the Ray Lyman Wilbur Collection
on the Social Problems of the United
States. The small reading room and
the conference room to the left have
become the headquarters of the Civil
Affairs Training School.
On the second floor you find many
i small research rooms, then story
j after story of library stacks, six
floors of which are completely filled
at present. The Hoover archives are
located on the ninth and tenth floors,
while Mr. Hoover and Dr. Wilbur
have offices on the eleventh, and
Dr. Lutz's office is on the twelfth.
Carillon Donated by Belgians
Tine famous carillon, which occu
pies the thirteenth and fourteenth
floors of the tower, was given to
| Stanford in 1!)40 by the Belgian
| American Educational Foundation at
the close of the New York World's
| Fair after being exhibited in the
! Belgian Favillion. Tht.'t are 35 bells,

the largest weighing 15.000 pounds
in this set which was cast in Tour
nai, Belgium. One bell bears the in
scription in Latin: "Because I am
Leopold. I ring only for peace over
the Atlantic."
The carilloneur who plays the in
tricate keyboard so skillfully each
day is James Lawson, a graduate
student. He came back here to play
these bells after practice as assistant
carilloneur at the Rockefeller Me
morial Chapel of the University of
Chicago.
