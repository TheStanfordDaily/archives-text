# REVIEW
## Critics Pick Top '44 Movie 
### 
Yesterday afternoon Barney Gu
j gel, noted California humorist, and
! your reviewer got together and
| picked what we consider the ten best
| pictures of 1944.
Last year our c hoice for the top
picture was "Casablanca," which
later won the Academy Award.
I This time, after much discussion,
we agreed upon "Going IVIy Way"
as 1944's top picture.
Others in the top ten were: "A
I Guy Named Joe,' "Gaslight," "Dou
j blc Indemnity," "Lady in the Dark,"
I "Mr. Skeffington" (Gugel's idea),
j "Miracle of Morgan's Creek," "See
Here Private Hargrove," "Old Ac
quaintance" (another Gugel brain
storm), and "Wilson."
