"We woke up and they told us
that the Japanese had attacked Ha
waii . . . that Pearl Harbor had been
bombed . . . And so we were at war
and we tried to think that books and
classes were important and we kept
on with our work, only stopping now
_ and then to listen to the news re
worts . . . And from now on that is
the way it's going to be. For four
years we will hear sirens and hear
bombers and live in blackouts and
come close to death . . ." So wrote
Bull Scssioner Cheslic Snroyan in
the Stanford Daily for December 11,
1941. And he was doing no more
than echo the atmosphere of con
trolled emotion and excitement per

j vading the Stanford campus on that
I epochal Sunday in December.
j . • . Those From Hawaii
"We were in our rooms at Ruble
j waiting for dinner when we heard
i the news," one senior recollected.
| "Suddenly the halls were filled with
j screaming freshmen. We wont
down to dinner and the one notable
circumstance was the fact that it
, was the girls whose families were in
Hawaii and the Philippines who
| were the calmest and who bucked up
| the others." Another senior's recol
lection of the student reaction on
that day was quite different, "We
came down to breakfast and it was
surprisingly quiet. No one talked
about the news. We were too stun
ned—the full significance of it, came
only slowly."
. . . And We Sang Carols
It is the details and small events
of that week which stand out most
clearly to many students. "It was
! the night of the Christmas dinner,"
j one .senior recalled, "and we sang
: carols—but all the Christmas had
i gone out of it." Another remem
i bered "that was the week of finals.
|Wo had blackouts almost every
| night and some of the professors cut
i the length of the finals."
On the following Wednesday Dr.
j Wilbur delivered a memorable ad
: dress to the student body in which
j be emphasized that "You may not
| think it is important to graduate.
You may get hysterical and think
J you've got to do this or that, or your
I parents may, but be careful not to
| get dislocated or let somebody dis-
I locate you." And Dean Yost, in a
| message to the students, followed up
| Dr. Wilbur's appeal and added that
j "In the years that I have been at
j Stanford I have-never been so proud
I of tin* student body nor more hope
ful of its future than I am tonight,"
