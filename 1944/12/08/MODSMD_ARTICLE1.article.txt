# Crane Gives Deft Polish To New Role
## 
### 
Out of the shambles of a complex,
difficult farcical drama, one inter
pretation makes attendance at the
current Stanford Players' production
of "Is Life Worth Loving?" its own
reward: George Crane's Hector de
la Mare.
Hampered by a badly written play,
the character of De la Mare best
illustrates what point there is to be
found in the play even as far as the
rest of the characters are concerned.
Poor Irishman
De la Mare was born a relatively
poor Irishman, who grew up to in
terpret, to act, to believe in, the
serious drama most often presented
by repertory theaters of the period:
Chekhov, Ibsen, for example. The
drama was so real to him that he
confused it, or was intelligent
onough to associate it. with real life.
The resultant philosophy: Is life
worth living? De la Mare is a ham,
but like all hams is just a little bit
tragic because he really believes in
the affectations in mannerism, intel
ligence, and graceful living that
make him a ham.
The Crane development of the fine,
delicate balance between tragedy and
downright comedy shows a deft, ex
perienced knowledge of technique,
plus an appreciation of the dramatic
elements inherent in the role.
Country Bumpkin
Mr. Crane is followed closely by
the expert dramatics of Edmond Ma
her, as Eddie Twohig. Mr Maher
is caught in a mass of bad writing
in the opening scenes of the play
when he is forced to portray a ridic
ulous country bumpkin, shy at the
mention of romance. Eddie Twohig
actually, is all Irish and everything
that being Irish implies. Mr. Maher
only has a chance to display the per
sonality of Twohig in one of the last
scenes of the play—an attempted sui
sidc, he regrets his decision and
swims to shore; but is still deter
mined to do away with himself by a
more effective medium than cold wa
ter. Christine is somewhat too ma
ternal in her calming of Eddie, but
Mary Cogswell was properly re
strained.
Every actor and actress in the pro
duction evidenced hard work under
capable direction; they did the most
with the material, but the material
wasn't much. Their personalities are
well known to you and all will be
interested in seeing the following on
the stage of the Little Theater: Sally
Stocker, Mary Higgins, Patricia Noil
son, Martin Nalder, Mary Martin,
Milton Valentine, Richard Moor
steen, Murray Stilton and Herbert
Rubin.

Country Bumpkin
Mr. Crane is followed closely by
the expert dramatics of Edmond Ma
her, as Eddie Twohig. Mr Maher
is caught in a mass of bad writing
in the opening scenes of the play
when he is forced to portray a ridic
ulous country bumpkin, shy at the
mention of romance. Eddie Twohig
actually, is all Irish and everything
that being Irish implies. Mr. Maher
only has a chance to display the per
sonality of Twohig in one of the last
scenes of the play—an attempted sui
sidc, he regrets his decision and
swims to shore; but is still deter
mined to do away with himself by a
more effective medium than cold wa
ter. Christine is somewhat too ma
ternal in her calming of Eddie, but
Mary Cogswell was properly re
strained.
Every actor and actress in the pro
duction evidenced hard work under
capable direction; they did the most
with the material, but the material
wasn't much. Their personalities are
well known to you and all will be
interested in seeing the following on
the stage of the Little Theater: Sally
Stocker, Mary Higgins, Patricia Noil
son, Martin Nalder, Mary Martin,
Milton Valentine, Richard Moor
steen, Murray Stilton and Herbert
Rubin.


GEORGE CRANE . . . appearing in
"Is Life Worth Living?''
Out of the shambles of a complex,
difficult farcical drama, one inter
pretation makes attendance at the
current Stanford Players' production
of "Is Life Worth Loving?" its own
reward: George Crane's Hector de
la Mare.
Hampered by a badly written play,
the character of De la Mare best
illustrates what point there is to be
found in the play even as far as the
rest of the characters are concerned.
Poor Irishman
De la Mare was born a relatively
poor Irishman, who grew up to in
terpret, to act, to believe in, the
serious drama most often presented
by repertory theaters of the period:
Chekhov, Ibsen, for example. The
drama was so real to him that he
confused it, or was intelligent
onough to associate it. with real life.
The resultant philosophy: Is life
worth living? De la Mare is a ham,
but like all hams is just a little bit
tragic because he really believes in
the affectations in mannerism, intel
ligence, and graceful living that
make him a ham.
The Crane development of the fine,
delicate balance between tragedy and
downright comedy shows a deft, ex
perienced knowledge of technique,
plus an appreciation of the dramatic
elements inherent in the role.
