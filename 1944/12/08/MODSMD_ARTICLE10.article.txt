### LORRY I. LOKEY 
One of the outstanding medical schools of the country is Stanford Uni
versity's Medical School in San Francisco, said Mr. F. W. Weymouth, head
of the Physiology Department. "Originally the Cooper Medical College,
this school, consisting of the property and facilities, was deeded over to
Stanford on October .'>o, 1908.

"Ai Ihnl time the medical staff
consisted of about, fifteen instructors.
I In contrast today, there arc five or
| six times that number of Stanford
I medical instructors now serving with
| the armed .forces.
Lane Medical Library
"The Lane Medical Library, con
sisting of more than 102,000 volumes,
ranks as the finest and largest medi
cal library this side of Chicago. One
of the excellent collections in the
library is that on the history of medi
j cine, collected by the late Dr. Adolph
i Barkan. These 5000 books and
! pamphlets, donated by Dr. Barkan
to the Lane library, have received
favorable comment from many of the
distinguished scholars in the medi
cal field.
"Instruction began at the medical
school in the fall of 11)0!) when only
15 students were enrolled, while the
total Stanford population at that
time was 1,7(50. By the years of
IGI4-15, the medical school had a
total enrollment of 93 students.
Permanent Quota Set
"In recent years, however, a per
' manent quota has been set for the
â€¢ entering class. Since certain labora
i tories can seat only 60 students, the
j entire class is limited to this number.
"Of the three hundred qualified
applicants in normal times, the Com
! mittoe on Admission and Advanced
Standing must choose the top (>O.
j This amounth to a man-sized job,
; since the past records of each stu
dent must be checked and interviews
fciven. As a result of this careful
selection by the committee, the
I number of failures is very small.
"By having a limited enrollment,"
he said, "each medical student re
ceives more individual attention. The
training of each medical student lasts
for 12 quarters, five of which are
-pent on the campus.
