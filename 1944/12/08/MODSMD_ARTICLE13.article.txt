clude such outstanding campus

Siani, Jackie Herr, Russ Toye,

Pitts, Jack Siemer, and Harvey

"I have thrown my hat in the
ring," shouts Our Hasher, Joe
Sher, and he too is now cam
paigning with old - fashioned
mud-slinging fury for the title.
More Possibilities
William Snow, John Kirby,
John Richards, and Pink Tanner
are also prominent possibilities
for the post, but dark horses
loom on all sides, and the
Wielder of the Frigid Sceptre
will not be definitely known
until midnight tomorrow.
The Shoemaker band has
been playing Hollywood shows,
USO camp shows, and Bond
Drive rallies recently, and is
rated a smooth outfit. Dick
Tauber, baton wielder, is a New
York product, and is noted for
fine handling of the sax. Vo
calists with the band include
tall, handsome Chuck Daley,
just back from Saipan, and Jane
Curry, a beautiful redheaded
Wave who has appeared in sev
eral of Mickey Rooney's pic
tures.
