A crowd of students, somewhat depleted by impending midterms and
overdue term papers, rallied to the call of Auctioneer Johnny High last,
night and bid $6,911 on such wartime valuables as cigarettes, original
Chappie cartoons and masculine dates at the Cardinal-sponsored auction.
An anonymous Roble woman stirred the crowd by capturing such prizes

as Ric. Supple and Joe Sher for
highest totals of the evening, $1,000
and $.'>oo respectively. Said .she, "I
was all prepared to pay $1,000 for
Slier, too."
The amount of each bid was
pledged to a specific hasher team, i
to supplement their totals in the
inter-hasher contest. Men from the
hash teams al Roble came out ahead
with $1,55(1; Chalet hashers followed
closely with $1,401.
