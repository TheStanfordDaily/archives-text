I suppose farewell editorials should be concerned with the
rrreen of Stanford hills, the hum of distant aircraft, the famous
' tricky swivel chair," the green-topped desk, and a sentimental
qoodbye to the new editor. A farewell editorial should have a
lot < 112 stuff in it, and perhaps most of all it should not be written

hurriedly—as this is being written—in the usual
atmosphere of the busy, hectic Shack.
This farewell editorial should have been
v/ritten in the mountains, I think; it would have
been snowing outside, preferably, and there
would have been a very definite fire and a
bottle.
Or maybe it would have been a hot day in
California—when white is so white it is shatter
ing, and green is so green it is like the color of

a dream. There would have been an enormous pool, of course;
finite quiet, emphasized by maybe J. Hodges or C. Debussy.
Cut farewell editorials are never written under ideal condi
tions; they are always a stab in the dark, a grasp for that sudden
•understanding of humanity and its purpose—a suddenly re
leased shaft of intelligence that always, and quite humanly,
misses the mark.
Farewell editorials are usually too confined in scope, lacking
historical imagination or perspective; incurious of the future,
doubtful of the present, they usually fail to recognize the most
important thing in life; human beings. Maybe we only realize
that through the catalyst of war, but I think some of us do now,
end any hope we have for a peaceful world must lie in human
understanding.
Anyway, as far as the aily has been concerned, Volume 106
has made its contribution to the growth of Stanford. People—
Dick Crane, George Crane, Joe, Nancy, Eilers, Hodge and Ber
r >e, Skid, Mort, Bill, the back shop, the staff, from the Shack to
the rolling foothill:'—have made this volume, and made it one
to be remembered.
So, with all possible dignity, and much less, and much more
than sentiment, the brain sends the impulse, the fingers pound
the old Underwood, to write at last: 30.
