# Our Hasher Sez:

### Joe Sher 
The beginning of the end:
This is the kissoff. To those loyal supporters who read my
column and enjoyed every word of it (not at gun-point either)
1 send my thanks and my heart-felt appreciation. To the other
OS per cent I give the bird.
The one loyal per cent who explained my jokes and retold
the tales and yarns which I tried to relate suffered as I did for

they bore the brunt of the comments which the
unfeeling public hurled in my direction. I
could take it though, for didn't many other of
the great wits and writers of history suffer for
their efforts in the quest to bring a light to the
dark and dismal life of man?
Hashers, Who Know It All:
The hashers of the campus, the men who
know it all and tell it to everyone, have been
the chief source of my information on the ac-

t;vmes of the campus. The hashers are among the "in group"
and deserve special commendation for the girls in the respec
tive houses love their hashers and stick up for and praise them
to the sky, as well as mooching smokes and riding out for a
quick reeb.
7 he Dens of the Highways and the Byways
!he fun in the dens of the highways and the byways cannot
! '• overlooked. The good old games like hide and seek with the
B. of E. men were really fun. The old here's to tried and
I i.;e and various other little ditties were sung loud and joyfully.
I.ittle bouts with stop watches and bets livened the quarter,
i itimate and heartt-o-heart talks with Willie and Eddie enlight
' ned us about the facts of life, for we had heard about but had
i ever seen those before. Bologna sandwiches and reeb hit the
• pot on many a night and trying to get three elephants instead
of conjugating a verb wasted many anotner evening', to say
nothing of a lot of that old lettuce.
A Hose to the Phantom:
The Phantom deserves his share of the credit for this column
for when all else was dead and unexciting we could always
count on the Phantom to come up with some little incident or
activity that would keep the campus in stitches for a week or so.
The End of the End:
Don't sit back nonchalantly in your seats and think that now
that this quarter is over this turkey will settle back into his cage
- 'id try to go plus a few and here is where the bite comes in, I
v/ill be back next quarter to plague you again.
lust think of what your feelings would be if you should open
your morning Daily, while drinking a cup of the old Cellar mud,
' nd not see Our Hasher blazing out in front of you. I know that
you would probably sob hysterically and come forth with "We
< re saved at last, he has probably been run over by a car or
omething else equally unpleasant," but, no, for that is not to be
) our fate for I have a constitution of steel (outside of a litile
ojourn in the hospital) and I hope to be around.
The Daily in my estimation this quarter is the Daily and under
o sterling leadership of Dave Davis (I don't dare say anything
se for he will cut my salary) the Daily rose to heights never
'tained in many a year. We end this little blurb with a big six
o Dnve and a new pencil for the proofreaders. We end with a
l.aditional Daily signature, Snirly Seath.
