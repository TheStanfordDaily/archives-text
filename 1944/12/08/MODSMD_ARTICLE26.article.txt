# BULL SESSION
## 
### Dick Crane 
This is it! This is the "swan song" of your sessioner for this
column. Next quarter someone new will start to fill this column
daily, and all bouquets, pannings, plugs, and various and as
sorted things pertaining to the Bull Session of Vol. 106, will no
longer be remembered. According to the laissez-faire doctrine
of economics, this is as it should be, as in due course of time

maladjusted forces tend to equalize themselves.
In this last column, I could be humorous, but
I won't try; or I could be caustic, but I shan't; I
could be deadly serious, but I can't. In other
words, I'm going to write the damn thing with
out any objective, just the way I have longed
to do all quarter.
I'm going to start off by saying that things
won't be nearly the same next quarter here in
the Daily Shack. The very atmosphere will be

different. No more late conferences in the Editor's office, as Dave
is in there now pounding out his farewell, with tears rolling all
ever the place—where they are joyful or sorrowful, it is hard
to guess. Talking about the editor, I want to pay a sincere trib
ute to a fine fellow, and a damn good newspaperman. He has
been a major factor in the resurrection of the Stanford Daily as
a living part of this University.
Next, I want to mention the fact that the student body has
shown itself admirably able to snap out of some of its lethargy
by going overboard in regard to the Sixth War Loan. Thanks
very much, and I want you all to know some of my cynicism
has been removed regarding the patriotism of Stanford Univer
sity—along with other fighting alumni of Stanford.
Next, I want you all to know that "Our Hasher" and I are the
best of friends. I really think he is a good guy, and beautiful too.
You know, beneath all the sordid ugliness of a thing, there is
bound to be true beauty. For example, take the looks of a bull
dog. Our feud in reality was just a gag for entertaining reading.
An explanation is the next thing in order. In my many com
ments on various events, happenings, student government,
whether they were caustic, or sweet, I want you all to know that
the opinions and comments were merely reflections of my own,
and in no way did they represent anyone's but mine.
The last thing I want to say in regard to my writing this col
umn so appropriately called Bull Session, is that it is with a great
deal of nostalgia and sorrow that I quit writing this column. It
certainly gives a person a hell of a lot of satisfaction to shout
aloud, and have three thousand people listen.
So with hat in hand, a bottle of beer in each pocket, and my
typewriter under my arm, I slowly do a buck and wing out of
the door of the Shack, amidst a flourish of adieus (French for
goodbye), adioses (Spanish for "It's been swell"), alohas (Ha
waiian for so long), goodbyes (English for goodbye), and fin
nally—SEE YA (Stanford's own inimitable style).
