Tonight the last number of Voiume 106 will be filed, the
whole will be enclosed in a great leather cover to be closed and
shelved, and our competent editor, Dave Davis, will take his
place among those who have preceded him. He will be remem
bered well as an intelligent and diplomatic executive in a busi
ness where those qualities are essential and hard-bought. And,
following our system of administrative hierarchy, the underlings
! each advance a step into their respected deserved positions.
I chose this theme of the closing of the book because it is
physically symbolic of the quarter's end and of its achievements.
Within the book are recorded for an indefinite time all the move
ments, great and small, which the Daily saw fit to preserve. But
more important than the movements are the motivations for
ihose movements, the thinking or emotions behind them. In
these factors lie the value of a quarter and the characterization
of a class.
Fortunately, the Daily this quarter sponsored more column
ists and by-line writers than ever before within my experience.
Bull Sessionmaster Dick Crane and Hasher Joe Sher were the
principal spokesmen in this department of journalism, and if
their expressions be representative we may be able to divine
something of the stuff of which we are made.
Remember, Bull Session, merely by tradition and public ac
ceptance, has been a humor column, and Crane originally fol
lowed the pattern which was cut out for him. Good. Sher, doing
i revival, talked of this and that in a light vein, keeping us posted
on parties around and about as well as the activities of the Kappa-
Dee Gee intramural squad. All was as it should have been and
the only complaints were a few from students questioning the
fulfillment of the columnist's avowed functions.
But during the past ten days or so, the personal tone of the
Daily has changed radically. The meat in the editorials has be
come thicker, and the columnists have reverted from their al
leged humor to a manner which is definitely serious. Within
these days, bones of controversy were gnawed and tossed back
and forth with surprising vigor. Our writers have focused critical
eyes upon student government, questioning its efficiency and
potency; the recent Gaieties came in for a pummeling which may
or may not have been entirely deserved; the question of inter
collegiate sports has appeared again, and the answer still waits.
Is it that the stimulation of the Sixth War Loan drive has made
us realize that we are still a country at war? Is it merely the pe
riodic approach of finals and the anticipation of the Christmas
rush? Or is it just the termination of an omen-laden leap year
which has caused this sudden heat in our temperaments as dis
played by our columnists? There is anger in the air and it faces
all directions, but has it gotten us anywhere? Neither the stu
dents nor our elected leaders seem to know what to do, as evi
denced by a recent committee meeting; the Gaieties group coun
terattacked wtih an ineffectual missile, and neither camp is satis
fied; as for intercollegiate sports well, that bone is hardly rec
ognizable any more.
So endeth the year. It is not with irony that I close my brief
series with the seasonal greeting of Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year.
