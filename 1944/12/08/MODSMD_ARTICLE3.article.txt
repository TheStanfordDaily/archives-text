### 
ALLIED HDQ., Leyte, Philippines, Dee. 7 (U.R)â€”American troops landed
three miles below Ormoc in a daring amphibious thrust Thursday as the
Philippines campaign blazed into action again with the opening of a
knockout drive to clear the Japanese from Leyte.
General Douglas Mac Arthur also announced that American fliers had

riddled a 13-vessel Japanese con
voy and that 4,000 enemy troops
went down with the ships.
'"These operations," Mac-Arthur
said in a communique, "took place
on Dec. 7, the third anniversary of
the beginning of the war,"
Resistance to the surprise land
ing by the U. S. 77th Division was
"negligible," and there were "prac
tically no ground losses," the com
munique said.
The troops poured quickly ashore
under the protection of a naval
bombardment and rocket - spitting
landing craft.
A typical Mac Arthur maneuver,
the landing split the enemy's 30-
mile defense line running from be
low Limon to below Ormoc, even as
it bent under the pressure of other
American ground forces.
American airmen sighted the Jap
anese convoy approaching the west
ern shores of Leyte almost immedi
ately after the new landing and at
tacked. A swirling air battle broke
out over both the enemy convoy and
the American naval forces in Or
moc Bay, and when it was over the
13 enemy ships, which included four
large transports, two freighter trans
ports and seven destroyers or de
stroyer escorts, one American de
stroyer and one small American
transport had bee nsunk; 62 enemy
planes were shot down by American
fighter planes and anti-aircraft fire.
