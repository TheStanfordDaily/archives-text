# AST Echoes

And this is the last of the Echoes—
to which, I hope, not everyone will
breaths a sigh of relief. For me, the
Echoes have been an infinite source
of pleasure and a great time saver.
Instead of writing a letter to each
of my relatives, I merely steal a few
thousand —(prolific family—Dailies,
rip out my stuff and mail it, together
with a few touching words request
ing a few pictures of Washington as
painted by that superb artist, Henry
Morgenthau, Jr. Notice the grace,
the sublime simplicity, the balance,
of these designs: "$ $$"... Simply
aren't they?

Reminiscing on the past (almost)
quarter brings the thought of how
rough the date problem has been for
the Stanford woman. Even Sebastian
Bruno could get an occasional date
(seven times a week). On Sebas
tian's last furlough, which he spent
in Hollywood, he was spotted by
Jimmy Durante who stared at him a j
while, then rasped. '"And all these
years I thought I was a novelty!"
Bruno tried to get Hurricane in
surance from the Lloyd's of London,
but was turned down, as they tested
him in a wind tunnel and found that
he Hies like a bird in any gale, ap
proximately 100 miles per hour—not
that his ears are large. This gives
you an idea of how rough this rough
situation is—or does it?

The War Department has again be- !
come interested in the rough situa
tion at Stanford and has obliged by
sending in over one hundred (not
ten, not fifty, but one hundred) ad- I
vanced engineers. All these men
have had at least one year in en- ;
gineering as a civilian before the war.
These men are fresh from the j
troops—did I say fresh? Boy, do
these men look beat out. However,
with plenty of sleep, good food, the '
Stanford PT program, shaving and
washing facilities, and the "eye rest"
treatment of Stanford co-eds, they
should recover and resemble h man
beings by the Snow Ball Saturday.

Postwar plans: 1. Make sure there
IS a postwar. 2. Pursuit of the 4F's:
Fun, fame, fortune and females. The
latter will be pursued former. All
this prattle brings up the subject of
reconversion. It seems that no one
in Washington has considered any
thing about the terrific onslaught of
men returning after the war who will
be pursuing the latter former (wom
en to you) instead of the enemy.
The biggest problem in this recon
version is the fact that the present
plan is to bring the boys home in
ships and does not provide for any
plan whei'eby the men are safely
delivered home to the waiting wom
en before some designing dock fe- j
male makes him forget he had a
home. My plan involves parachuting
the men earthward over their own j
home towns, thus giving home town
women first choice at the returning
soldier, which is only fair. This will
be Sadie Hawkins Day Reconversion
Plan Z8955. Since congress is always j

overlooking brilliant plans, the only
solution to this tragic problem is,
"See ya at the docks!"

Who requested the "Nine-Twenty
Special" as recorded by Count Basie
on the early morning record pro
gram? It there something prophetic
in that title? Bruno was touched.
