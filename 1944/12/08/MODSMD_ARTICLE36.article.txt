"After winning the war our most
important problem will be setting
up an organization of United Na
tions to stop total war from becom
ing a recurrent cycle," said Dr.
Ralph H. Lutz, professor of history,
dean of graduate study.
The Dumbarton Oaks plan is an
excellent beginning, he feels, even
though it will present certain prob
lems to threaten our future security.
Treatment of Germany
Most urgent and immediate ques
tion will be our treatment of Ger
many. How can we best prevent her
from threatening world peace for a
third time in this century? The
question is being hotly debated in
London, Moscow and Washington
and by leaders of public opinion
throughout the United Nations.
German Occupation
First task of the victors, feels Dr.
Lutz, will be our joint military oc
cupation and administrative con
trol of the Rerman Reich within her
pre-1938 boundaries.
Leading nazis, as well as lesser war
criminals, must be tried and pun
ished. German armed forces must
be immediately demobilized and dis
armed until only a police force re
mains to keep internal order and
relieve our occupational forces of
minor duties. Moreover, disarma
ment must be thorough and perma
nent.
Armament and aviation industries
should be eliminated, and other key
industries such as chemical, steel,
synthetic oil, machine tool, automo
tive and aluminum should be care
fully controlled.
Fair Reparations
Germany's reparations should
definitely include (a) all loot from
occupied countries or its equivalent,
(b) labor to help restore devastated
areas and (c) German manufactured
products to be exported over a pe
riod of time. This plan provides no
such wholesale destruction of Ger
many as was envisaged in the so
called "Morgenthau plan," nor does
it provide for any maintenance of
cartels such as was proposed by cer
tain liberated nations, Dr. Lutz ex
plained.
By far the most difficult problem
of our dealings with Germany will
be the formation of a new and demo
cratic form of government. "In my
opinion," said Dr. Lutz. "any attempt
to impose a system of education, gov
ernment, or way of life upon the
Germans will only result in a recru
descence of nationalism. It must be
remembered that every educated
German will be conscious that the
Fatherland was defeated only by an
alliance of the three greatest pow
ers on earth."

Finally, Germany will probably
lose one-fifth of its "pre-1938 area as
forced territorial concessions to con
tiguous countries. These will be
mainly lands that have been disputed
for many years, belonging now to
one nation and then to another. It is
interesting to note at the end of
World War I, Germany gave up only
one-eighth of her pre-war area.
The defeat of Germany and Japan
is certain to be followed by the es
tablishment of a Union of Nations
which will eventually have the uni
versal membership and will be the
universal responsibility of all peace
loving nations, Dr. Lutz said. When
a readjusted Germany can be classi
fied as peace-loving, she too will
belong.
"When the states reach such ma
turity," he concluded, "it will imply
the establishment of a permanent
organization of all peace - loving
states, so dynamic that no rebel can
defy it."

many. How can we best prevent her
from threatening world peace for a
third time in this century? The
question is being hotly debated in
London, Moscow and Washington
and by leaders of public opinion
throughout the United Nations.
German Occupation
First task of the victors, feels Dr.
Lutz, will be our joint military oc
cupation and administrative con
trol of the Rerman Reich within her
pre-1938 boundaries.
Leading nazis, as well as lesser war
criminals, must be tried and pun
ished. German armed forces must
be immediately demobilized and dis
armed until only a police force re
mains to keep internal order and
relieve our occupational forces of
minor duties. Moreover, disarma
ment must be thorough and perma
nent.
Armament and aviation industries
should be eliminated, and other key
industries such as chemical, steel,
synthetic oil, machine tool, automo
tive and aluminum should be care
fully controlled.
Fair Reparations
Germany's reparations should
definitely include (a) all loot from
occupied countries or its equivalent,
(b) labor to help restore devastated
areas and (c) German manufactured
products to be exported over a pe
riod of time. This plan provides no
such wholesale destruction of Ger
many as was envisaged in the so
called "Morgenthau plan," nor does
it provide for any maintenance of
cartels such as was proposed by cer
tain liberated nations, Dr. Lutz ex
plained.
By far the most difficult problem
of our dealings with Germany will
be the formation of a new and demo
cratic form of government. "In my
opinion," said Dr. Lutz. "any attempt
to impose a system of education, gov
ernment, or way of life upon the
Germans will only result in a recru
descence of nationalism. It must be
remembered that every educated
German will be conscious that the
Fatherland was defeated only by an
alliance of the three greatest pow
ers on earth."

Finally, Germany will probably
lose one-fifth of its "pre-1938 area as
forced territorial concessions to con
tiguous countries. These will be
mainly lands that have been disputed
for many years, belonging now to
one nation and then to another. It is
interesting to note at the end of
World War I, Germany gave up only
one-eighth of her pre-war area.
The defeat of Germany and Japan
is certain to be followed by the es
tablishment of a Union of Nations
which will eventually have the uni
versal membership and will be the
universal responsibility of all peace
loving nations, Dr. Lutz said. When
a readjusted Germany can be classi
fied as peace-loving, she too will
belong.
"When the states reach such ma
turity," he concluded, "it will imply
the establishment of a permanent
organization of all peace - loving
states, so dynamic that no rebel can
defy it."
