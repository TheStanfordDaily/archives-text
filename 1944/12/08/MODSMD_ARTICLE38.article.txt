# T.H Boggs, Cosmopolite, Tells Past
## 
### RUTH GORDON 
Why is it that the quiet and un
assuming people always manage to
be the really interesting ones? That
is certainly the case with Dr. Theo
dore Bogg.s, acting executive head of
the Economics Department. After
assuring me that there was little in
terview material in his life, he kept
me fascinated for the whole course
of the interview.
The son of Canadian parents, Dr.
j Boggs was born in India while his
: father was president of a theological
college there. He saw his first snow
on Mount Rigi in Switzerland, and
remembers swimming in the Italian
naval port at Brindisi, which was re
cently featured in the news.
Dr. Boggs was brought to America
at the age of 9 to be educated and
went to school in New England and
Nova Scotia. After his graduation
from Yale, his first teaching job was
j at Dartmouth.
j He considers the five years from
1916 to 1921 at the University of Brit-
J ish Columbia as the most stimulat
ing and interesting teaching experi
ence in his life. When he arrived
there in 1916, Cnaada had already
been at war for two years and, as a
consequence, all the male students
were returned war veterans, some
with only one eye or one leg.
j "Those students in age were boys,
but in approach and attitude they
were men," Dr. Boggs explained.
"They didn't care about grades, units
or 'apple-polishing,' but preferred
| lengthy congenial 'bull-sessions' with
j their instructors, man-to-man over
! a mug of beer—vigorous discussions
I in which they insisted on being re
j garded as men!"
Dr. Boggs likes Stanford very
much and his primary interest is in
the field of international trade. Pie
said that whether deservedly or un

deservedly, the Stanford Economics*
Department seems to be held in high
esteem, and rightly or wrongly, it is
regarded as being extremely libetal.
As a result of the war, the Economics
Department has temporarily lost

Why is it that the quiet and un
assuming people always manage to
be the really interesting ones? That
is certainly the case with Dr. Theo
dore Bogg.s, acting executive head of
the Economics Department. After
assuring me that there was little in
terview material in his life, he kept
me fascinated for the whole course
of the interview.
The son of Canadian parents, Dr.
j Boggs was born in India while his
: father was president of a theological
college there. He saw his first snow
on Mount Rigi in Switzerland, and
remembers swimming in the Italian
naval port at Brindisi, which was re
cently featured in the news.
Dr. Boggs was brought to America
at the age of 9 to be educated and
went to school in New England and
Nova Scotia. After his graduation
from Yale, his first teaching job was
j at Dartmouth.
j He considers the five years from
1916 to 1921 at the University of Brit-
J ish Columbia as the most stimulat
ing and interesting teaching experi
ence in his life. When he arrived
there in 1916, Cnaada had already
been at war for two years and, as a
consequence, all the male students
were returned war veterans, some
with only one eye or one leg.
j "Those students in age were boys,
but in approach and attitude they
were men," Dr. Boggs explained.
"They didn't care about grades, units
or 'apple-polishing,' but preferred
| lengthy congenial 'bull-sessions' with
j their instructors, man-to-man over
! a mug of beer—vigorous discussions
I in which they insisted on being re
