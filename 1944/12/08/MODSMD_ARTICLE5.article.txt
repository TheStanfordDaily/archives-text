WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (U.R) —
Three super fortresses were lost due
to enemy action in today's raid on
Mukden, the War Department said
tonight, instead of only one as pre
viously reported.
Two intrepid American super fort
resses, primarily on a reconnaisance !
trip, showered Tokyo with bombs in
raids last night and early today, •
commemorating Pearl Harbor day, I
i while sister planes raided strategic i
military targets in Japaijese-occu- i
pied Manchuria, the announcement I
said.
The Manchuria attackers shot j
j down or damaged 63 Japanese fighter j
1 planes.
One Tokyo raider hit the capital
from a cloudless sky while the lights
of the city gleamed undimmed be- J
j neath them, and the crew saw the |
angry flames of seven fires streak j
up. The second plane bombed the
city today from an overcast sky. j
Both planes carried the heaviest
bomb loads yet carried by a super- j
fort in attacks on Tokyo. The planes !
' which hit Mukden were based in
China. The Tokyo raiders flew from j
Saipan and the Marianas.
