# BOND SALES HIT $40,000

### 
Stanford's Sixth War Loan drive skyrocketed over the top
of its $27,500 quota last night as war bond dollars from hasher
teams, bond booths, and auction pledges poured into the War
Board office, bringing the grand total to $40,250.
Still to be added to the University total is money coming from
bonds sold at last night's Cardinals auction, from late pledges,
and from the faculty bond drive.
Starting with a pitiful purchase of $37.50 in bonds Novem
ber 27, the Stanford drive worked up to a whirlwind climax when
sales for yesterday, the third anniversary of Pearl Harbor, hit
$13,925.
Hasher team competition, begun this week by War Board to
promote campus participation in the drive, ended last night with
the Alpha Phi hashers reporting $4,675 worth of bonds sold, an
average of 165.8.
Hasher teams were judged on a proportionate basis, which
gave the TriDelt hashers second place with $3900 and an aver
age of 130.0, according to Bond Chairman Mildred Edwards.
Third place went to Branner, $4,025, 31.2; Roble, $7,875, 25.9;
Lagunita, $5,175, 17.5; Theta hashers, $500, 16.6; Pi Phi, $475,
15.8; Kappa, $325, 10.8; Gamma Phi, $250, 8.3; Union, $2,300,
8.02.
Throughout the week auctions of wartime valuables at Bran
ner, Lagunita, and Union pushed the bond totals upward on the
thermometer indicator posted outside of the Old Union.
Jeeps, driven by military police from the Presidio of San
Francisco, careened over the campus yesterday as students
purchased rides to the gym, Palo Alto, and 1 o'clock classes for
$2.50 in war stamps, sold in front of the Bookstore by Jacqueline
Jardine. Soldiers were entertained at lunch at Theresa Russell
House and Jane Lathrop House. Milton Levy, men's WB co-or
dinator, arranged for the demonstration. An estimated $500 worth
of war stamps were sold.
War Board expresses its appreciation for the co-operation and
support of the student body in making the bond drive a success,
Co-ordinator Jeannette Grimsley said last night. Miss Edwards,
bond chairman, added her thanks to the persons who sold war
bonds and stamps in the booths and living groups.
The bond booth at the Cellar corner will be open today and
Monday to collect pledges not yet fulfilled. War Bonds will be
issued to purchasers in approximately two weeks, Miss Grims
ley stated.
