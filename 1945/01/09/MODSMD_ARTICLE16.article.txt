# Volume 107... a Precede
## THINGS TO TALK ABOUT 
### 
It is, perhaps, impertinent to outline an edi
torial policy for a volume of Dailies which will
record some of man's most momentous his
tory in even its smallest United Press Captions.
Knowing, however, that without a certain
amount of brashness we would hardly dare to
venture outside our own door into this complex
world, we are going ahead to try to find what
are "the things to talk about" of our time and
to seek the terms in which to meet them.
The comments which we offer in the editorial
columns of Volume 107 will be offered as the
ideas of students who cannot be expected to
know new and startling facts about the news
of the day. At most, we can be expected to
bring what we consider may be significant
facts to your attention, and to call for further
discussion and further facts, which we hope
we shall be able to do through out Campus
Opinion columns.
We hope the Campus Opinion column will
be used as more than a place to grouse and
groan, and will find, without embarrassment,
constructive and sincere discussion of any af
fairs of the world. Those dauntless souls seek
ing to ease their minds about Cellar coffee and
cringing Daily columnists will find their ac
customed sounding board all too ready, of
course.
Our policy will be to accept only those Cam
pus Opinion letters that are signed, though we
will withhold names upon request or inform
the writer otherwise.
The Bull Session of this quarter will continue
to feature the highlights and lowlights of the
news—campus and otherwise. Volume 107 is
introducing a new column, to run several times
a week, called "Seen from an Ivory Tower"
which proposes to be just the opposite of what
its name may imply to sensitive Stanford
people.
History, 1945 will attempt to interpret and
emphasize the significant in the news, espe
cially in the war, with a minimum of opinion
but some of the detail that our daily news dis
patches, of necessity, must forego.
Our Hasher will appear on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, conducted by the Hasher of Vol
ume 106, who developed a good-natured and
well - read column of just about everything
Stanford was saying and doing.
This column may become quite tiresome as
a result of the zeal with which we expect to
puisue the thought that Stanford students do
not pay enough attention to the extra-curricu
lar, non-unit, non-prestige-making activities
which are offered in the various Series lec
tures, group meetings, and bull sessions around
campus. We hope that we can encourage at
every opportunity students who attempt to re
vive and institute activities that have lagged
and disappeared because of the war.
It seems that Stanford has passed the first
self-conscious shock that we are without inter
collegiate sports competition and pots of gaso
line and in the year '44 '45 has already (1) re
sumed Men's Vocorn and smokers and dramatic
oral readings, (2) has attempted a Discussion
r Jnion which should not have failed perma
nently, (3) has started a Hot Jazz Society. Win
°r quarter is customarily a slow quarter, but

there is no reason why these activities, popular
on campus, should not receive support which
will further encourage such activities, any
more than there is reason why war work should
fall off.
Like most other campus organizations, the
example of a few "real" leaders has made the
Daily survive its most trying period, when the
advertising revenue hit bottom taking staff
morale with it.
We call attention to the fact that the campus
is now setting itself into gear for that time, not
indefinitely postponed, when "the big red ma
chine" will assume its post-war responsibilities
fully. We face the fact that it is now—and for us,
as well as anybody else, to determine what
this future will be.
There are enough people on campus now who
have made up their minds that there is much
of Stanford that we can do without, much that
has come from the reality of war that should not
be shoved aside. They are things for those here
now, before the curtain goes up for a second
act, so to speak, to decide and certainly to
think about.
The columnist to be opposite on the page puts
it this way: "From the height of an Ivory Tower
things do not always have the same aspect as
when viewed from the ground; many large ob
jects seem trivial, many small ones reveal them
selves in strategic positions, other things are
too far away to be visible."
Say what we may, our position as students
is to learn, to seek, to explore—that is the value
of an Ivory Tower, as we have come to call
this position which precludes making de, isions.
But neither is this position merely to postpone
the necessity of thinking to a decision.
We hope, therefore, that Volume 107 may
contribute, in any small measure, to bring a
proper focus upon the things looming large in
our world and others appearing now as only
ephemeral headlines outside. We are certain,
at least, that there is too much to talk about
these days everywhere to remain silent.
