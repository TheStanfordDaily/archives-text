## VACATION TO THE SOUTH 
### By--Well, read it find out 
"Flopum, flopum, flopum, wentabit the wheelos."
—Sinatra.
"The name's Crane—George Crane—isn't it?" he
volunteered after we had spent four silent hours on
the clean cut, good leaning — but nice—observation
platform on the Southern Pacific Daylight (adv.).
"Nope," I said at length.
"Dick, then?" he quizzed brilliantly.
"Naw," was my witty reply.
"Ichabod?" There was perseverance but restained
emotion written in his hemp-hued eyes.
Yes, they were,rather large eyes.
"Nuh-uh," I exhaled with care, .seeing that my
rapid repartee (Speech 417, MWF) had obviously
uneased him.
Above the cracking of my gum I heard snatches
of gutteral sanskrit which I translated:
"... name's Ford, Stanley Ford . . . call me Stan.
Then it was that I learned his secret.
There was no lacka tobacca—if I may corn a phrase
—in his high straight jacket* which was well padded
with Tijuana Tumble Weeds. You know the firm
. . . Want a Weed? You'll go for a Tumble.
I said to myself, "Neighbah Ford looks vogue on the
outside."
"Though vague on the inside," I answered myself.
A sudden "This is your Daylight Reporter" wheezed
through a filter caused our He-ro's hemp-hued eyes
to blind in accordance with the startle pattern. Neigh
bah dextrously adjusted the F.M. on his battery . . .
The Voice continued: "If you will turn left 2M
degrees over your light shoulder while dangling bv
your heels from the guard rail facing Jupiter, you
will see—Famous Horseshoe Turn."
Spurred on by his Sunny Santa Clara Valley up
bringing and his natural joie de vie, Neighbah clutched
his cartons of choice cheroots closer to his person
and prepared to follow directions. Note: luckily Stan
got there before the hoarders.
But—get a firm grip on your Dip . . . but due to
circumstances beyond his control his chute failed to
open and he landed with Bonga-like grace on a Burma
Slave shine.
"The name is Smith," 1 called with renewed inter -
est of at least 5 per cent. "Backwards it spells Htims."
The very first words to meet his now black-hemp
eyes restored his faith, in the Procter and Gamble
philosophy that Life Can Be Beautiful.
He read:
She's Enraged!
She's Lonely!
She uses 20 mule team Borax!
