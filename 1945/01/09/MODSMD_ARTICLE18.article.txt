### BILL ADAMS 
Perhaps it is a little late to bring
up football, now that the pigskins
and uniforms are all safely laid away
in mothballs for another year, but
there are a number of questions con
cerning that worthy sport which need
airing. It was the various bowl
games, and especially the East-West
Shrine game in San Francisco, that
particularly called these matters to
our attention.
In the first place, the East-West
game showed us one thing clearly:
that, on the whole, football players
from the Pacific Coast and other far
western conferences are every bit as
good as those from east of the Mis
sissippi. Before the Shrine game
started, the East term was a three
to-one favorite to cop the encounter.
This was due mainly to the fact that
the East roster contained the names
of many all-Americans and other
pigskin greats of the past season. The
western team, an the other hand, had
hardly a single player whose name
is known in football circles east of
the Rockies. There are two players
from the Coast Guard Pilots, a team
of which comparatively few people
even on the Coast have heard, on
West's first string. When East had
Horvath, Kelly, Dancewicz, etc., it is
no wonder that they were so highly
favored.
West Victorious
And yet the western team won the
game, 13 to 7. This was no fluke;
the statistics are enough to prove
that. Man for man, the westerners
consistently outplayed their eastern
rivals. Perhaps UCLA's sensational
Bob Waterfield did have a good day.
Perhaps Horvath and Kelly and the
rest were a little off their game that
day; that is hardly enough to ex
plain the play of a whole team.
All this goes to show one thing:
we have just as good players right
here on the coast as will be found
anywhere in the East: we just don't
have the same publicity machines.
Perhaps this goes a little way toward
explaining why so few western
names are found on the annual all-
America squads. It is our personal
opinion that Bob Waterfield and Jim
Hardy rank with the greatest backs
turned out this year, but who saw
their names on the all-American list?
Waterfield certainly looked a lot bet
ter than anything the East could
offer in the Shrine game.
More Publicity
If an eastern player looks good,
his name is broadcast all over the
nation in sport pages and on the air;
if a western man shows exceptional
promise his publicity is generally
confined to areas within his own
conference. Perhaps if this situation
were changed the Big Ten conference
might consider the Rose Bowl in a
different light.
And, incidentally, why don't we
have an official all-America? It
seems to us that more and more pop
up each year, until now there must
be at least ten major ones. The
NCAA ought to be able to compose
an all-star team that would be ac
ceptable io all.

might consider the Rose Bowl in a
different light.
And, incidentally, why don't we
have an official all-America? It
seems to us that more and more pop
up each year, until now there must
be at least ten major ones. The
NCAA ought to be able to compose
an all-star team that would be ac
ceptable io all.
Perhaps it is a little late to bring
up football, now that the pigskins
and uniforms are all safely laid away
in mothballs for another year, but
there are a number of questions con
cerning that worthy sport which need
airing. It was the various bowl
games, and especially the East-West
Shrine game in San Francisco, that
particularly called these matters to
our attention.
In the first place, the East-West
game showed us one thing clearly:
that, on the whole, football players
from the Pacific Coast and other far
western conferences are every bit as
good as those from east of the Mis
sissippi. Before the Shrine game
started, the East term was a three
to-one favorite to cop the encounter.
This was due mainly to the fact that
the East roster contained the names
of many all-Americans and other
pigskin greats of the past season. The
western team, an the other hand, had
hardly a single player whose name
is known in football circles east of
the Rockies. There are two players
from the Coast Guard Pilots, a team
of which comparatively few people
even on the Coast have heard, on
West's first string. When East had
Horvath, Kelly, Dancewicz, etc., it is
no wonder that they were so highly
favored.
West Victorious
And yet the western team won the
game, 13 to 7. This was no fluke;
the statistics are enough to prove
that. Man for man, the westerners
consistently outplayed their eastern
rivals. Perhaps UCLA's sensational
Bob Waterfield did have a good day.
Perhaps Horvath and Kelly and the
rest were a little off their game that
day; that is hardly enough to ex
plain the play of a whole team.
All this goes to show one thing:
we have just as good players right
here on the coast as will be found
anywhere in the East: we just don't
have the same publicity machines.
Perhaps this goes a little way toward
explaining why so few western
names are found on the annual all-
America squads. It is our personal
opinion that Bob Waterfield and Jim
Hardy rank with the greatest backs
turned out this year, but who saw
their names on the all-American list?
Waterfield certainly looked a lot bet
ter than anything the East could
offer in the Shrine game.
More Publicity
If an eastern player looks good,
his name is broadcast all over the
nation in sport pages and on the air;
if a western man shows exceptional
promise his publicity is generally
confined to areas within his own
conference. Perhaps if this situation
were changed the Big Ten conference
might consider the Rose Bowl in a
different light.
