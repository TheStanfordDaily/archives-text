# Lindskog Returns from Spectacular Season
## 
### MORT COHEN 
In the old days, the linemen
might have done great work, but
they would get very little glory.
This has changed a great deal
lately, what with spectacular line
men like Harry Smith of USC and
Don Whitemire of Navy, but the
chances for glory are still very
slight. And only once in a lifetime
does a lineman get the chance to
make his own glory by scoring a
touchdown on a spectacular run.
This great moment did come to Vic
Lindskog, boxing coach of Stan
ford, and he took full advantage of
it. In the Brooklyn game, while
playing for the Philadelphia Eagles
this last season. Lindskog inter

| cepted a pass and ran G5 yards to
J score.
That was only one of the many
instances when Lindskog proved to
j be the great all-American he was
; at Stanford. He, and seven other
1 coast players, helped lead the
1 Eagles to a second place in the
i Eastern League and an undefeated
| season, with the exception of a loss
('to the Chicago Bears. Although
Lindskog didn't play in the first few
j games because of injuries to his
foot and knee, he was well enough
to start in the final ten encounters.
In reference to the Chicago game,
Lindskog stated that half the field
was frozen over and the other half
was mud. The Eagles didn't have a
chance, for the heavier Bears

pushed them around all over the
iield.
But. a.s though playing center for
a top team wasn't enough, Lindskog
also helped coach a high school in
Philadelphia. His team was the only
high school team in the nation to
use the Shaughnessv T. The head
coach was also a Shaughnessy dis
ciple, having assisted him at both
Pittsburgh and Maryland. The team
didn't do so well in the beginning of
the season but won the last four out
of five games.
Other coast players on the Eagles
were Bruno Banducci and Loren
LaPrade of Stanford; Steele of
Washington; Banta and Bleeker of
USC, and Leroy Zimmerman of San
Jose State.
