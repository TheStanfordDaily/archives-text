# Germans in Ardennes Retreat
## 
### 
PARIS, Tuesday, Jan. 9 (UP).—The Germans began retreating
on a 30-mile Ardennes front Monday under grinding pressure by
the U.S. First Army, which captured nine more Belgian towns
and synchronized advances while the northbound Tlih-l Army
left the enemy only a six-mile-wide corridor through the bulge
ripped by thousands of American guns.
The First Army, in gains up to two miles, drove within five
miles of the Houffalice-St. Hubert road, and the Third Army,
gaining three miles at some points during the day, reached
within one mile of that vital artery at a point to the southwest.
Paradoxically, the two armies still stood ten miles apart due to
their separate routes of attack.
