# Terman To Return as Dean of Engineering
## 
### 
A new dean of the Stanford School of Engineering was announced De
cernber 26 by President Donald B. Tresidder with the appoinment of
Dr. Frederick E. Terman, on leave since 1942 from the Stanford engineer
ing faculty to serve as head of the government's radio research labora
tory at Cambridge, Mass.

Dr. Terman, who wiii assume his*
duties upon release from his present J
position, succeeds Samuel B. Morris
who resigned recently to become
general manager of the Los Angeles
Municipal Department of Water and
Power.
Tre*»idder Says
"Dr. Terman's scholarly contribu
tions in the field of electrical engin
eering and his administration of one
of America's largest war research
projects," President Tresidder said,
"place him among the outstanding
engineers in the country. Stanford
is very fortunate in securing his ser
vices as Engineering dean."
In February, 1942, Dr. Terman was
invited by Dr. Vannevar Bush, direc
tor of the Office of Scientific Re
search and Development, to organize
the Radio Research Laboratory un
der the auspices of the OSRD. To
day, several hundred scientists under
Dr. Terman's supervision are work
ing behind closed doors on counter
measures to protect the armed
forces agai.ist enemy radio and radar
devices. The War Department re
cently released news that the labora
tory had perfected a secret weapon,
used in the European invasion, to
drop strips of silvered paper from
American bombers to confuse enemy j
radar equipment.
National President of Radio Institute
In 1941, Dr. Terman served as na- i
tional president of the Institute of
Radio Engineers, first man to be
chosen for the position from west of
the Atlantic seaboard.
The new dean, who has been exe
cutive head of the Stanford Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering since
1937, is the author of five standard
texts on radio engineering. Son of
Professor Lewis M. Terman, Stanford
psychologist who made "I. Q." a
household word, Dr. Terman was i
granduated from Stanford as top man
in the class of 1920. He also holds
the electrical engineer degree from !
Stanford (15)22) and the doctor of'j
science degree from Massachusetts j
Institute of Technology (1924).
Skilling Acting Head Since 1941
Dr. Hugh H. Skilling, professor of j
electrical engineering at Stanford, !
was appointed executive head of the
Department of Electrical Engineer- j
ing to succeed Dr. Terman, President !
Tresidder announced. He has served ;
as acting head of the department \
since 1941.
Since Pearl Harbor, Dr. Skilling !
has supervised secret research proj- I
ects conducted in Stanford's engin- j
eering laboratories for the National '
Defense Research Committee, the j
Sperry Gyroscope Corporation, and
the Federal Telephone & Radio Lab- J
oratories of New York City. Re
search has been on radio propaga
tion. ultra high-frequency radio
measurements, and special problems*'
involving the "klystron."
Receives Degrees
Dr. Skilling received the A.B. de- '
gi ee from Stanford in 192fi; the Elec- ,
trical Engineer degree in 1927, and
the Ph.D. degree in 1931, having re
ceived in the meantime the M.S. de- '
gree from the Massachusetts Insti- !
tute of Technology in 1930.
On the Stanford faculty since 1931,
he is the author of two books on j
electric power transmission.
