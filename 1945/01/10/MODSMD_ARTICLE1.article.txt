### MELLON SHELTON 
Newly-appointed Mary Lou Me-
Clure assumed for the first time yes
terday her office of vice-president of
the A.S.S.U. Miss McClure, a third
quarter junior, was appointed to suc

body vice-president when Miss Up
shaw resigned at the end of last
quarter; in the vice-presidential
election race held spring quarter of
1944. Miss McClure came in second
to Miss Upshaw.
"We are anxious that living groups
a>id organizations apply for dates for
their social functions immediately,"
said Miss McClure; "we want to fill
the social calendar as quickly as pos
sible. to avoid confusion. Due to the
war," she added, "we are stressing
on-campus activities as much as pos
sible."
Tentative plans for all-campus
functions and activities included
hopes for community singing under
the direction of Dr. Jan Popper and
Dr. D. Sterling Wheelwright; con
tinuation of the popular Tresidder
hikes: barbecues at the pew barbecue
pit, and the Soph Cotillion, biggest
dance of the year.
Suggestions will be welcomed, said
Miss McClure. and must be submit
ted to the Social Committee which
was organized recently to fill in gaps
on the social calendar. 'We want,"
Miss McClure concluded, "to have
as full a social life on campus as the
war will permit; but war activities
come first."

(Ed. note: The following is a
statement by Barbara White, ASSU
president)

With 1C45 and the New Year, we
can make fresh starts and new plans.
At the same time we cannot leave
undone the work we have started
and that is, for this year—the build
ing of a postwar Stanford. We would
not go back if we could. This gla
morizing of the past is not for us
today as we are being rudely jolted
from our peacetime psychosis.
But looking to the future does not
mean that we are to merely mark
time until the war is over and things
become what is commonly called
"normal;" for normalcy, as it was
known then, will not return. This
is, then, a period for building. So it
is with our Stanford student govern
ment—a period of gradual transition
with the aim of constructing a better
student government.
Postwar Plans
This quarter, besides working on
the constitution and setup of the
postwar student government, Excom
will investigate and decide on the
questions of the scope of the Honor
Code, the nominating system, school
spirit, and more adequate represen
tation in student government. But
the ideas and opinions of every stu
dent are necessary to come to a both
sound and popular decision. The
meetings of Excom are open to all
students. The agenda is presented in
the Daily so that one can see what
is to be considered at each meeting.
All suggestions are welcomed. When
the Daily speaks with an under
standing and knowledge of the facts
and speaks for a number of students,
it is to be heeded.
There is one source of student
opinion. But it should be seen that
the representatives on Excom are the
best source and must speak and vote
for those who elected them. They
are there to hear your views and
opinions and vote accordingly.
Excom Members
Your upper division representa
tives are Ed Luce of Monroe Hall and
Helen Jones of Roble. The lower
division representatives are Jeanne
Soule of The Chalet and J. D. Wil
liams. who can be reached at 8.'<24.
The member-at-large is Betsy Bab
bitt of Jessie Jordan House, and"the
graduate member is Geraldine Fitz
gerald of Lagunita. Any suggestions
or ideas that you have about student
government or Excom decisions
should be made to ihem so that they
may be acted upon. Ex-officio mem
bers of Excom are also available and
anxious to relay any of your
opinions.
"A democratic student government
can only function effectively if each
individual takes part and voices his
opinions. It is only with everyone
taking part that we can realize our
goals and continue to build our stu
dent democracy to its highest peak of
efficiency.

"We are anxious that living groups

Tentative plans for all-campus

hopes for community singing under

With 1C45 and the New Year, we
can make fresh starts and new plans.
At the same time we cannot leave
undone the work we have started
and that is, for this year—the build
ing of a postwar Stanford. We would
not go back if we could. This gla
morizing of the past is not for us
today as we are being rudely jolted
from our peacetime psychosis.
But looking to the future does not
mean that we are to merely mark
time until the war is over and things
become what is commonly called
"normal;" for normalcy, as it was
known then, will not return. This
is, then, a period for building. So it
is with our Stanford student govern

student government.
