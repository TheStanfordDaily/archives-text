In welcoming students to our Farm we are
in the strange position today of addressing a
mixed audience. The problem of civilian stu
dents is the one we know best and today we
want to say "Hello" and the following to them.
Much of what these students come to think
abuut Stanford will be judgments of a Stanford
that has groaned and creaked under the trials of
its wartime existence.
Civilian students will be faced with a cur
ricula that has been curtailed as our professors
and students have gone to war. They know how
ever, or they would not have come, that there
is still a fund of knowledge and skill with which
they can become equipped here at Stanford
and a faculty group that has seldom hesitated
to discuss both individual problems and prob
lems of their field with students.
We are lucky in the extent to which we know
our professors and we hope new students will
become part of the friendly relationship which
has existed.
We hope too that you will be interested in
the ideas and work of your fellow students.
During the early part of the quarter many
campus organizations will ask you to attend
their tryout periods. We hope that you will
choose carefully and find the work and people
that will help you to be a part of the Stanford
life that you like best.
In choosing your courses you probably came
as all of us did, anxious to know, and yet
strangely self-assured that there are a few
things you have learned that do not permit
much room for doubt. If you sincerely seek
to know what your. subject matter "means"
as well as says, you will probably find many
of your most cherished beliefs were merely
prejudices, and many of the things you laughed
and jested at in high school are deadly serious.
We hope that you will take courage when these
things happen, because they are indications that
you are learning the lessons which this univer
sity is here to teach.
Some of your classes will disillusion your
expectation of many subjects you have felt must
be the key to great truths, others will startle
you when footnotes and side remarks from the
right person, are the answers you have sought
in vain in tomes and from verbose know-alls.
In all your problems we know you will find
that the guy across the hall, that inexplicably
goes plus a million, the BWOC that darts around
campus, the sulky superior in campus organiza
tions, all really have known the same thing and
welcome you with particular affection and con
cern as one of the Stanford Family.

During the early part of the quarter many
campus organizations will ask you to attend
their tryout periods. We hope that you will
choose carefully and find the work and people
that will help you to be a part of the Stanford
life that you like best.
In choosing your courses you probably came
as all of us did, anxious to know, and yet
strangely self-assured that there are a few
things you have learned that do not permit
much room for doubt. If you sincerely seek
to know what your. subject matter "means"
as well as says, you will probably find many
of your most cherished beliefs were merely
prejudices, and many of the things you laughed
and jested at in high school are deadly serious.
We hope that you will take courage when these
things happen, because they are indications that
you are learning the lessons which this univer
sity is here to teach.
Some of your classes will disillusion your
expectation of many subjects you have felt must
be the key to great truths, others will startle
you when footnotes and side remarks from the
right person, are the answers you have sought
in vain in tomes and from verbose know-alls.
In all your problems we know you will find
that the guy across the hall, that inexplicably
goes plus a million, the BWOC that darts around
campus, the sulky superior in campus organiza
tions, all really have known the same thing and
welcome you with particular affection and con
cern as one of the Stanford Family.
In welcoming students to our Farm we are
in the strange position today of addressing a
mixed audience. The problem of civilian stu
dents is the one we know best and today we
want to say "Hello" and the following to them.
Much of what these students come to think
abuut Stanford will be judgments of a Stanford
that has groaned and creaked under the trials of
its wartime existence.
Civilian students will be faced with a cur
ricula that has been curtailed as our professors
and students have gone to war. They know how
ever, or they would not have come, that there
is still a fund of knowledge and skill with which
they can become equipped here at Stanford
and a faculty group that has seldom hesitated
to discuss both individual problems and prob
lems of their field with students.
We are lucky in the extent to which we know
our professors and we hope new students will
become part of the friendly relationship which
has existed.
We hope too that you will be interested in
the ideas and work of your fellow students.
