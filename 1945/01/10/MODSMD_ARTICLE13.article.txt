# FAR CRY FROM BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Along with all the other rapidly changing
events that are taking place in the world today,
changes have come to the Stanford Daily.
There are new columnists, new reporters, a new
set of bosses, and even a new department
known as editorial writers. This heterogeneous
qroup, consisting of five members, will write

on various topics such as campus and world
affairs.
I am going to be a member of this group, and
it will be a far cry from writing Bull Session.
I will have to refrain from my usual profanity,
also from my attempts at humor, and last but
not least, refrain from writing anything in a
suggestive manner. But never fear, friends,
I do not have to stop criticizing. I can still
run up and down the walls of Stanford's famed
Ivory Tower, and shout to the multitudes. To
coin a phrase of a former editor, "heads will
roll!"
We are going to put our observations down
in writing, cynically but correctly, and through
this medium hope to change things for the
interest of the University as a whole. These
columns and their writers will try to be un
biased in their opinions, and our whole pur
pose is to try and enlighten you on topics
which will work for the ultimate in under
standing and progress.
The writing of an editorial column is an en
tirely new field for me, so I hope you will
bear with me until I learn.â€”Dick Crane
