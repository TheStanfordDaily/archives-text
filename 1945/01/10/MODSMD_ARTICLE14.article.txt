# Seen from an Ivory Tower
## FANCY MEETING YOU HERE 
### Walrus the Carpenter 
Editorial Note: Today Volume 107 introduces a
strange something to its ever-critical audience and to
day we devote an entire column by way of introduc
tion. Providence willing, it will appear thrice weekly.

At first glance it seemed as though some one had mis
placed the Hoover War Library during the night.
Obviously, we decided, this is the result of the com
bined efforts of the Physics and Mathematics Depart
ments—something hush-hush, an unmentionable prod
uct of Abstract Research. Or perhaps something pro
duced by a little dabbling with Abnormal Psych.
Over the door—a smallish, oak door, which had been
well weathered—hung a small sign: 'The WALRUS
and The CARPENTER.' Glancing up at the huge
structure which towered above us like an industrial
chimney crossed with a Moslem mosque, we noticed
a few small windows set deep into the thick walls. The
door opened meantime to reveal two strange figures:
a long and lanky Carpenter and a shorter figure, the
Walrus.
"Built in 1!)02" proclaimed a brass plate just beyond
the threshhold, "Department of the Interior, U. S. Govt."
"Yes," said the Walrus, "it used to he a lighthouse,
but somehow the light never worked. When Iloovcr
auctioncd it in the dismal days of '2!). we were the high
est bidders—with 5N.27, thirteen shares of Cal Packing
(preferred) and an autographed portrait of Marie
Dressier—and we have lived here ever since."
"And," added the Carpenter in a more practical strain,
"we have hot and cold running water, an unleakable
roof, and a self-cleaning spiral staircase."
But we had more serious intentions and, like the
ever-curious reporters from the New Yorker, we exam
ined and questioned and grilled and cross-questioned
and asked and observed and analyzed and psycho
analyzed and dissected and anatomized until we had
laid bare their very souls.
The Walrus and the Carpenter (we concluded) com
bine dissimilar but highly desirable qualities.
It will be remembered from "Alice Through the
Looking Glass" that the Walrus begs the oysters to
admire the view—proving bis sensibility and apprecia
tion of Nature. Nor is he a surly brute, ungrateful for
the pleasures of life: he politely thanks the oysters for
their companionship and rewards them with a testi
monial on their "nicencss." All of this speaks creditably
«»f his courtesy and good taste—of the quality known
as soul.
The Walrus is a philosopher and a gentleman, I'm
afraid that we must admit, however, that the Carpen
ter is no gentleman. He shows an indecent haste in his
anxiety to get the matter over with. In his reply to
the Walrus's fine sentiments he simply says: "Cut me
another slice"; his partner's display of sympathetic
emotion arouses no answer in his breast—even food
does not solten the inflexible sourness of his disposition.
His last complaint sounds odd in these days of ration
ing. but there is no mistaking the genuine grouse who—
when he can find nothing else to criticize—grumbles,
"The butter's spread too thick!"
These are the characters, gentle reader, who for this
quarter have unwisely been given charge of the column.
If there is anything here that raises your blood pressure
or makes you feel wobbly at the knees; anything ex
tremely stupid (the Walrus) or extremely dull (the
Carpenter), don't claim that you were not forewarned.
From the height of an Ivory Tower things do not
always have the same aspect as when viewed from the
ground; many large objects seem trivial, mail) small
ones reveal themselves as in strategic positions; other
things are too far away to be visible.
Consider a final advantage. Editorial writers in the
Daily will be robbed of their favorite cliche. By taking
the Ivory Tower seriously we hope to see the phrase
worked into the ground from which not even the
Daily editorials will dare resurrect it.
