# Fine Acting Marks Screen Version of ”Winged Victory”
## 
### 
WINDED VICTORY —Now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
Moss Hart's story of the Army Air
Forces, "Winged Victory," is one of
the lew stage plays that has \inder
gone a successful transition to the
screen. Fine acting performances by
a group of ex-Hollywoodites now in
the service are mainly responsible
for this pleasant surprise.
''Winged Victory" tells the story
of a group of heterogenous cadets
who eventually win their silver
wings. Pictured is that first day in
the service with everybody bleating
"'You'll be sorry," the many physical
and mental tests taken, the first solo
flight, and the commissioning exer
cises.
Included in the cast are Mark Dan
iels, Edmund O'Brien, Barry Nelson,
and Lon McCallister. O'Brien's per
formance as a drunk is one that
you'll probably remember for a long
while. Barry Nelson turns in a fine,
sincere job while Lon McCallister
scores again in another of his "I'm
so dumb it hurts" roles.
"Winged Victory" is perhaps too
emotional in spots, but remains
throughout a conscientious effort to
capture the spirit of America's air
men.
Returning to the screen after win
ning the coveted title, "Miss
Smudge-Pot of 1944,'' Jean Parker
turns detective in a bunch of tripe
dubbed, "The Adyentures of Kitty
O'Day," which masquerades as the
second feature. Miss Parker has ac

quired a new wig and her wardrobe
consists of old gunny sacks. Any
day now joltin' Jean will probably
appear at San Francisco famed Lib
erty Burlesque under the name
"Peaches" Parker.—Dick Bower.
