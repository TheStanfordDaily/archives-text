# Szego Emphasizes Math. Necessary to Sciences
## 
### RUTH BENJAMIN 
'"Without math one cannot very
well understand modern civiliza
tion," began Professor Gabor Szego,
head of the Department of Mathe
matics, School of Physical Sciences.
It is very important for mental
training, and is used in many
sciences*, notably physics, chemistry,
engineering and medicine."
Professor Szego received the de
gree of Doctor of Philosophy at the
University of Vienna in 1918. He
has instructed at Budapest, Hungary;
the University of Berlin; Washing
ton University, St. Louis, Missouri,
and has been at Stanford since 19">8.
Like most every mathematician, he
has a particular field of interest; but
is not too one-sided about it, dis
playing interest in all fields of math.
Special Field Analysis
Contributing to his special field
of interest, analysis, he has written
five books and SO papers on the sub
ject.
Stanford's standing in mathemat
ics is excellent, pointed out Mr.
Szego, the department being consid
ered one of the very best in the
country.
There are two full professors, four
associate professors and several in
structors in the department, although

| two men are engaged in important
war research work at present.
The department is contributing di
j rectly to the war effort. Several
hundred engineering and science
students are taking math, including
| about 150 ASTRP soldiers; but, of
1 course, this figure seems small com
pared with the l.liOO ASTP soldiers
! of last year.
"Some Like Math"
After the war, Professor Szego
I expects a great number of veterans.
! He even stated that there will be
| difficulty in obtaining enough good
| teachers.
''Some like math and some don't,"
i remarked Mr. Szego. However,
everyone should be able to get SOME
j kick out of it. Sometimes, though, it
is too late, since interest is killed by
bad teachers. A great deal depends
! upon the teacher and the way he
I presents the subject."
He stresses that math has impor-
I tance to all, including ordinary,
j everydoy people who can use it for
practical, commercial and financial
i purposes.
"Primitive Math"
It is necessary for such common
tasks as computing income tax, or
checking grocery bills, although Pro
fessor Szego remarked that one
doesn't need to come to Stanford
for THAT type of â€¢"primitive math,"
as he called it.
"Of course, students not particu
i larly interested in math or sciences
j don't need to take such a subject as
i calculus, except to understand eco
| nomics, for example," concluded Pro
| fessor Szego, "but it is a surprising
fac tthat some Stanford student don't
know the simple multiplication
, tables!"
