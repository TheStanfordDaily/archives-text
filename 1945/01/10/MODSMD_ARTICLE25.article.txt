"Aitists and writers are needed in
the worst way and will be welcomed
with open arms," stated Fayram

want women to do stuff around the
office too," he added.
Gilbert (widely known in France
as Guillame Guilbert) was quoted as
saying. "When it comes to ad-selling
jobs and office positions, we got
plenty of 'em. 112 want the entire
campus to show up at the Chappie
office tonight. And as for you, little
girl,—yuk-yuk—."
