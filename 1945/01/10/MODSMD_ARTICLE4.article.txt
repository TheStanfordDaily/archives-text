# Holsti Speaks On Diplomacy
## 
### 
Speaking with humor and empha
sis, and with some nostalgia, Dr.
Rudolph Holsti last night opened this
quarter's Tuesday Evening Series
with a talk on his "Memoirs of a
Diplomat." And he spoke with au
thority, for he spent the years from
1916 to 1941 serving his native coun
try, Finland, in various capacities as
a diplomat and statesman.
Dr. Holsti began his talk with an
apology for the word "memoirs" in
the title of his address, "because,"
he said, "diplomatic ethics do not
permit me to tell of some of my
memories which must still remain a
secret." 9
He wanted to correct some mis
taken impressions, ho said, by say
ing that from the time Finland was
given to Russia by Napoleon as a
grand duchy in 1804 until 1900 the
relations between Finland and Rus
sia were very close, until Russia
tried to trespass on Finland's right
to self-rule, and the rift became
greater until Finland finally gained
her independence in 1919.
Dr. Holsti's activities as diplomat
to the Allied powers in Paris and
London in 1918 were instrumental in
gaining their recognition of Finland's
declaration of independence. Dur
ing this time he worked closely with
Herbert Hoover and Lord Hardy of
England, and was the only Finnish
diplomat working with foreign na
tions at the time.
From 1922 until 1930 Dr. Holsti
served as Finnish representative to
the League of Nations. He worked
quietly in Finland until 1941, when
he was offered a post at Stanford
and seized the opportunity to come
to the country which he had so long
admired.
In reviewing his experiences Dr.
Holsti said he gained greatest satis
faction in remembering the great
personalities he had met and with
whom he had worked. They had al
ways been ready and willing to co
operate with him, he said, an& "if
your cause was a good one, they
would find means of helping it. They
are the true servers of humanity."
