ALLIED HQ., LEYTE, Jan. 10. (U.P.)—Veteran U. S. Sixth Army
troops invaded the main Philippine island of Luzon yesterday
from an 800-ship armada, establishing a 15-mile beachhead on
Lingayen Gulf against Japanese resistance so beaten down by a
three-day bombardment that., not a single American in the first
assault wave was reported killed.
The Americans, under the personal command of General
Douglas Mac Arthur who went ashore with his men, quickly
seized several coastal towns, among them San Fabian on the
Southeastern corner of the gulf, 100 miles northwest of Manila.
A headquarters spokesman said that some forces had reached
points within 107 miles of Manila on the south coast.
The Americans went ashore at 9:30 a.m. and encountered
only a few bursts of artillery and mortar fire. Front dispatches
said that there were so few Japanese on the beaches that only
a handful of enemy troops were killed.
"The Japs refused to fight," said one United Press dispatch
from the front.
Under protection of a thundering air and naval bombard
ment which had been in progress for three days, the landings
were made at four undisclosed points on the east and south
coast of Lingayen Gulf, where the main Japanese invasion force
drove into Luzon more than three years ago. The veteran Ameri
can troops had made deep penetrations inland at some points,
Headquarters spokesmen said.
