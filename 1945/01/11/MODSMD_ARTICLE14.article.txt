# WHAT ABOUT THE 4F?
## 
### 
Manpower Director Byrnes' proposal for 4F
draft caused more than a little worry here on
the Farm. A large percentage of Stanford 4F's
visited Dean Bunn as school reconvened; they
will learn the status of 4F's in college at tonight's
meeting when the Dean will explain the situa
tion in detail.
Meanwhile, here's a side of the question:
Stanford's physically-disqualified men are
more than willing to do their share in industry.
But they realize that well-trained young lawyers,
doctors, teachers, linguists, economists, political
scientists, journalists, and biologists, will be es
sential as postwar leaders.
Since they are unable to serve their country
in the armed forces, physically unfit men here
at home feel their war effort contribution should
be clear-cut, whether it be war work, college
skidy, or the numerous smaller unremunerative
activities.
There are jobs that are being done by civil
ians and women in the armed services that
many 4F's could feel proud to do. Why cannot
those 4F's find these uniformed jobs open to
them. It would be a fair position for Manpower
Commission to enforce, as their is no more rea
son to draft physically disabled boys to do
civilian work than their is to draft healthy young
women.
Most 4F's at Stanford have well-outlined pro
grams following a definite vocation. Many are
pursuing a four-quarter program to accelerate
graduation. Most of their objectives are pur
poseful and far-sighted. Certainly, these men
will be more valuable to their country in "win
ning the peace" and intelligently tackling peace
time readjustment.
It is doubtful, too, whether 4F's with hernias,
bad hearts, TB histories, asthma, and similar dis
orders could handle strenuous industrial assign
ments.
College 4F's don't want to get the jump on
returning soldiers. Nor are they trying to dodge
labor draft. They do want to be prepared to
meet inevitable problems of readjustment fol
lowing Axis defeat.
Should manpower and selective service ad
ministrators decide that college 4F's are more
essential to war industry, Stanford men will be
happy to serve in any capacity. We hape the
Government will consider college work for
4F's essential to a hard-earned peace.

Manpower Director Byrnes' proposal for 4F
draft caused more than a little worry here on
the Farm. A large percentage of Stanford 4F's
visited Dean Bunn as school reconvened; they
will learn the status of 4F's in college at tonight's
meeting when the Dean will explain the situa
tion in detail.
Meanwhile, here's a side of the question:
Stanford's physically-disqualified men are
more than willing to do their share in industry.
But they realize that well-trained young lawyers,
doctors, teachers, linguists, economists, political
scientists, journalists, and biologists, will be es
sential as postwar leaders.
Since they are unable to serve their country
in the armed forces, physically unfit men here
at home feel their war effort contribution should
be clear-cut, whether it be war work, college
skidy, or the numerous smaller unremunerative
activities.
There are jobs that are being done by civil
ians and women in the armed services that
many 4F's could feel proud to do. Why cannot
those 4F's find these uniformed jobs open to
them. It would be a fair position for Manpower
Commission to enforce, as their is no more rea
son to draft physically disabled boys to do
civilian work than their is to draft healthy young
women.
Most 4F's at Stanford have well-outlined pro
grams following a definite vocation. Many are
pursuing a four-quarter program to accelerate
graduation. Most of their objectives are pur
poseful and far-sighted. Certainly, these men
will be more valuable to their country in "win
ning the peace" and intelligently tackling peace
time readjustment.
It is doubtful, too, whether 4F's with hernias,
bad hearts, TB histories, asthma, and similar dis
orders could handle strenuous industrial assign
ments.
College 4F's don't want to get the jump on
returning soldiers. Nor are they trying to dodge
labor draft. They do want to be prepared to
meet inevitable problems of readjustment fol
lowing Axis defeat.
Should manpower and selective service ad
ministrators decide that college 4F's are more
essential to war industry, Stanford men will be
happy to serve in any capacity. We hape the
Government will consider college work for
4F's essential to a hard-earned peace.
