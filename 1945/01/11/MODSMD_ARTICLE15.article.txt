Dear Neighbah Clans:
I meant to write this "Thanx an Awful Lot" note Inst
veekend but, after I passed under the SRO (Standing
Room Only) canopy over Palm Drive, things have been
to use the vernacular —tufT. In fact, this is the first
ime that I've sat down since Reg morning.
I stood in line to see my adviser, to register, to get
<eat cards, to get into Folk Dancing (TThF 8 a.m.), to
nake all checks payable to Stanford (backward it
•;pells Drofnal; Diversity, to get out of Folk Dancing
still TThF 8 a.n to v,ot a bus to Alto Palto, to stand
ill the way down Escondido to Arguello. then left ofT

Argucllo to Serra, left on Serra to Galvez, to bid good
bye to our native driver, to get a table at the Bowl, to
get a menu, a dinner, and a toothpick at the same Bowl,
to flash my forged Brooklyn Racing Form Reviewer's
pass at the cashier, to see Jean Parker and Dick Bowfcr
fight it out for seven reels, to beerup at the Texas, to
hitch a ride back to the Fahm. to buy Cellah cigs from
my Cellah Fellah, to sign a lockout slip, to turn in a
ration book, to buy a pencil at the Bookstore, to fork
over my Room 'n Board, and to put in my application
for Encina sponsor.
But, as Moliere so cleverly put it in French 325:
" 'Nuff sed!"
Thank you first of all for the book. How did you
know I'd never owned one? The illustrations are lovely
and I haven't been able to put it down since it came. I
miss more classes that way. Yes, I've always wanted to
learn about the X-Ray Investigations of Fibrous Mat
ter in the Market Sense.
Then—but you really shouldn't have—the bound vol
umes of the Chaplin trial. As I probably won't have
time to read them (I'm so engrossed in my weighty
schedule of 13 units and the fibrous theories in the mar
ket sense) I will make a formal presentation of them
to Company C (dhur).
And thanks ve—e —ery much for the carload of
Bird's Eye Frozen Strawberries. There is really noth
ing better for those 10:30 spreads. Of course you had
no way of knowing about my allergy. Draping them
abo.ut my room should help counteract the rash, don't
you think?
Finally, that Cap and Gone calendar is just what I've
always wanted. I realize that your sending a 1935
copy was just an oversight. But. it will be hardly any
trouble at all to add five days to the lunar eclipse each
day and carry over a capital seven to the next month.
So—o—o Neighbah Claus, I nlust close. Thanking
you again ever so much for your most thoughtful, use
ful, but nice gilts, I remain your Civ Libe correspondent
who hopes that this epistle makes the 4 p.m. pickup. If
should, as the mail box is on the way to my Psychia
trists.

Dear Neighbah Clans:
I meant to write this "Thanx an Awful Lot" note Inst
veekend but, after I passed under the SRO (Standing
Room Only) canopy over Palm Drive, things have been
to use the vernacular —tufT. In fact, this is the first
ime that I've sat down since Reg morning.
I stood in line to see my adviser, to register, to get
<eat cards, to get into Folk Dancing (TThF 8 a.m.), to
nake all checks payable to Stanford (backward it
•;pells Drofnal; Diversity, to get out of Folk Dancing
still TThF 8 a.n to v,ot a bus to Alto Palto, to stand
ill the way down Escondido to Arguello. then left ofT

Argucllo to Serra, left on Serra to Galvez, to bid good
bye to our native driver, to get a table at the Bowl, to
get a menu, a dinner, and a toothpick at the same Bowl,
to flash my forged Brooklyn Racing Form Reviewer's
pass at the cashier, to see Jean Parker and Dick Bowfcr
fight it out for seven reels, to beerup at the Texas, to
hitch a ride back to the Fahm. to buy Cellah cigs from
my Cellah Fellah, to sign a lockout slip, to turn in a
ration book, to buy a pencil at the Bookstore, to fork
over my Room 'n Board, and to put in my application
for Encina sponsor.
But, as Moliere so cleverly put it in French 325:
" 'Nuff sed!"
Thank you first of all for the book. How did you
know I'd never owned one? The illustrations are lovely
and I haven't been able to put it down since it came. I
miss more classes that way. Yes, I've always wanted to
learn about the X-Ray Investigations of Fibrous Mat
ter in the Market Sense.
Then—but you really shouldn't have—the bound vol
umes of the Chaplin trial. As I probably won't have
time to read them (I'm so engrossed in my weighty
schedule of 13 units and the fibrous theories in the mar
ket sense) I will make a formal presentation of them
to Company C (dhur).
And thanks ve—e —ery much for the carload of
Bird's Eye Frozen Strawberries. There is really noth
ing better for those 10:30 spreads. Of course you had
no way of knowing about my allergy. Draping them
abo.ut my room should help counteract the rash, don't
you think?
Finally, that Cap and Gone calendar is just what I've
always wanted. I realize that your sending a 1935
copy was just an oversight. But. it will be hardly any
trouble at all to add five days to the lunar eclipse each
day and carry over a capital seven to the next month.
So—o—o Neighbah Claus, I nlust close. Thanking
you again ever so much for your most thoughtful, use
ful, but nice gilts, I remain your Civ Libe correspondent
who hopes that this epistle makes the 4 p.m. pickup. If
should, as the mail box is on the way to my Psychia
trists.
