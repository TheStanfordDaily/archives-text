# WAR FRONTS
## HISTORY—1945 
### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The "War Fronts" columns of the last two quarters
have come out of their militaristic rut to make a more
general survey of the significant aspects of the news,
and have become the traditional "History" columns. In
connection with political events, it will be our policy
to have several guest commentators in order to get
varied.viewpoints on the subject.
But the main factor in the recent news is the German
counteroffensive on the Western front. Thus we again
put on our gold-braided seer's cap in order to try to
see what is happening.
Beginning Stages
In order to fully understand this drive, it is neces
sary to go back to the last stages of our offensive to
ward Cologne. The left wing of the First Army was
not yet level with the Ninth Army, the latter having
reached the left bank of the Roer. Then General Hodges
attacked, and the German defense suddenly collapsed,
the enemy retreating across the river.
What obviously happened was that the German com
mander had seen that General Hodges' left had been
strongly reinforced, and, by prisoners captured from
new units, could name the divisions which had been
brought up. He thus fell back behind the stream where
he could make a better stand, and reported to von
Rundstedt's headquarters.
Von Runstedt realized that the new divisions had
formerly been on the First Army's left, down in Bel
gium and Luxembourg, and saw that this sector was
bein gheld with a dangerously light grip. Then he had
some luck; the weather was bad, and he could mass
200,000 men, probably his last reserve, in the forest
facing Hodges' right. The terrain and the weather
helped him do this.
Then he struck. He probably first decided to check
up with a fast-moving armored column on a fighting
reconnaissance, but this alone shattered our lines, and,
like Rommel when he first arrived in Africa, von
Runstedt turned a raid into an offensive. This probably
explains why, for so long a time, the German armor
was far ahead of its infantry support.
Americans React
Von Runstedt then split his forces and tried to fan
out behind us, but the two armies on his flanks—the
Third and the rest of the First—promptly drew back
their exposed wings and channeled von Runstedt's
drive straight ahead.
The next thing that happened was that the 101st
Airborne Division, under temporary command of Briga
dier General McAulifTe dug in at Bastogne, between
the German columns. This was a brilliant maneuver,
«nd it stopped von Runstedt.
Runstedt's Dilemma
II the field marshal continued operating with sepa
rated forces, we might reinforce the Bastogne pocket
before he could nip it off. and then fall on one of his
columns and destroy it before the other could render
aid. He thus had to stop and get his divisions well in
hand. True, he then went on and cut off Bastogne, but
General Eisenhower had time to wheel up reinforce
ments and relieved the place.
Von Runstedt probably realized that he couldn't hold
his bulge then. He didn't have enough manpower. But
ho had cut the highways by which our northern wing
could shift troops to support the southern one. and it'
he withdrew timidly, he would give up this great ad
vantage.
