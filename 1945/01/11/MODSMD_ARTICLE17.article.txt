# BUR HASHER
## 
### JOE SHER 
"The rush of registration, the sad
j ness of poor grades or the joy of
j good, cleaning, dusting, and straight
! ening rooms left in shambles in the
I hurry to get home, writing thousands
! of checks for old and new bills and
j hundreds of other miseries are not
enough punishment for the Stanford
student but, on top of it all, that
column, "Our Hasher," has returned
to plague our lives with unfunny
stories and news that everyone al
ready knows."'
These slandering and misguided
statements will probably run through
your mind as you catch your first
glimpse of the head in Stanford's
| most widely read publication — the
J Daily.
| However, since the sheet is small
| and you might have missed some
] thing, or have an extra minute
! throughout the day, we are going to
write this column again this quarter
—for your enjoyment.
We arrived along with the mass of
students who came on the Daylight
(safe this time from flying shells), on
the Lark, on the sturdy little Coaster
or pack train from Stockton, or on
skis from Yosemite.
This group is loaded with loot from
Christmas, alcohol from New Year's
! eve and lettuce from doting parents
whose patience is worn thin from
the unusual, or rather usual, grades
which appear with monotonous reg- \
ularity on our transcript as well as a
full set of cleats . . . '
Vacation is a lot of fun but it is 1
nice to be back on the Farm, where
we can rest and recuperate from va
cation with frequent inhalations of
clean Stanford air and stuff Pretty
good to be back where one can buy a
pack of cigarettes without waiting
for a day in a cigarette line
Everybody is loaded (no. not that
way, for it is too early in the quarter
as yet) with resolutions to make up !
i for the minus they went and to con- ;
tinue in the groove if they went plus <
at all.
Many of the prominent men !
around campus are still prominent
men but no longer around the cam
pus. It seems that many of them
failed to muster sufficient grade av
erages to maintain the standards of j
this Institution and are now in the !
defense plants or in that popular and
ever-expanding group, the Army.
That same old gag, the Reg Dance,
has been planned to allow the fresh
men and women to get acquainted,
and the BWOC to spot any new tal- I
ent in the freshman class. This must '
I work, for they try it year after year.
Skiing occupied much of the vaca
tion for many a happy student, or
lor those who had enough gas to
make the long haul (everyone saved
his A stamps for weeks). Skiing was
only a minor part of the activities
on Badger and ollior hills, as joyous
and number skiers drowned their
germs and sorrows of the previous
quarter in buttermilk and assorted
beverages. Sorta monotonous, climb
ing a little hill and then sliding down
on your skis . . . etc. (hard as hell
on your pants, besides).
