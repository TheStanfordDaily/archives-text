With basketball again taking the
limelight, we thought that it would
be a good idea if we looked over the
coast teams and gave them our un
biased opinion. Probably the hottest
of the Conference teams, and it hurts
us deeply to admit this, is California.
The Bears are built around the ex-St.
Mary's star. Gus Mota, and a much
improved high school graduate,
George Clyne. These two boys have
seen to it that Cal very seldom comes
in on the short end of the score.
Down south, the USC basketball
squad is continuing where the foot
ball eleven left off. They are leading
that section, but as yet have met
with very little competition. UCLA,
from all reports, is trying very hard.
As far as Service Teams go, there
have has nothing but upsets. The
leader is still a big question mark.
St. Mary's Preflight, minus the serv
ices of the-great Hank Luisetti, has
an above-average team. One of the
stars is H. B. Lee, ex-Stanford star
in Luisetti's days. He is considered
by many as one of the greatest prep
stars San Francisco has ever seen.
Sea Lions Hot
Vying for supremacy with the Fly
ers are the Coast Guard Sea Lions,
under the tutelage of George Ara
bian. In their only encounter with
the Flyers> the Sea Lions emerged
victorious and ended a four-game
losing streak. Starring for the Coast
Guard is Paul Napolitano, USF flash
of a few seasons back. It was only
recently that Napolitan got back his
eye and he was probably the main
factor in the upset of Preflight.
Another of the top Service teams
is the Presidio Lettermen. Tall "Bun
ny" Edwards, an old standby of the
Phillips Oilers and Twentieth Cen
tury Fox teams, is the main clog in
the soldier machine. Up to this date,
.Iwards has averaged about 14
points a game.
Armed Guard Strong
Another team playing in the Bay
area is the Armed Guard from Trea
sure Island. This team, though with
out the services of Dale Sears. USC
center, is still good enough to rank as
one of the best. Two other teams—
Borlo AC and SFAC—which are en
tered in the Northern California Bas
ketball Association, are the dark
horses of the Bay Area.
