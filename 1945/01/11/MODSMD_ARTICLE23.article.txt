# Kirkpatrick Explains Physics Services in War
## 
### JANE McENTIRE 
In his soft-voiced, friendly manner, Dr. Kirkpatrick, acting head of the
Physics Department, said that his department '"had probably contributed
more skilled men to the war effort than any other one in the University."
He explained his statement by pointing out that in addition to training
Army students—last fall the department's enrollment was three times the

♦■peace-time high, thanks to the A.S.-
T.P.—five physics professors have
either joined the service or are doing
special research for the government.
i Civilian Shortages
In fact, so many physicists left the
university to take active part in the
war that the campus was combed
I last year to find professors who
j could teach physics regardless of
I whether thier own departments
1 were biology or Romanic languages.
Right now, Dr. David Webster, per
manent head of the Physics Depart
ment is in the Army where he is
doing research on the rocket. He
will return to Stanford after the
war. *
X-ray Research
Dr. Kirkpatrick, who has been at
Stanford since 1931, was attracted
to this school because of the re
search being carried on here on X
rays. The position of department
head is not a new job for Kirkpat
rick because he has always man
aged departmental affairs whenever
Dr. Webster was absent on leaves.
Originally from Los Angeles, he
went to Alhambra High School and
Occidental College. Dr. Kirkpatrick
has done quite a bit of traveling in
the Orient.
He taught physics (with elemen
tary English on the side) in Hang
chow at a university which is now
probably being used to house the
Japanese army.
Part in World War I
After two years of teaching and
sight-seeing, Dr. Kirkpatrick came
back to the States to join the Army
in World War I. Later, he went to
Cal and Cal Tech for graduate study.
Dr. Kirkpatrick became particularly
interested in the X-ray field at this
| time.
In 1923, Kirkpatrick went to Ho
nolulu to teach at the University of
Hawaii. "This was just about the
only time we physicists got to com
bine our picnics and field-trips the
way the geologists do," smiled Dr.
Kirkpatrick as he confessed his
j envy of fellow scientists. The occa
-1 sion for the outdoor life was the
eruption of Mauna Loa in 1926 when
j physicists carried out their research
I problems near the crater's edge.
X-ray Called Tool to Atom Study
In 1931, Dr. Kirkpatrick came to
Stanford at the insistence of Dr.
Webster. The soecial project which
both Kirkpatrick and the Physics
Department as a whole have devoted
some time to is that of finding out
more about the X-ray.
