# Indian Finds Train Trip Interesting but Grueling

### CATHRYN OWEN 
January 6, G p.m.—
Oil". All's well. The green seat
covers match my brown suit. The
adjustable chairs please my curved
spine. The automatic windswipes are
keeping my eyes nicely defogged.
My third arm likes its ceiling sling.
I'm simple. I'm happy.
8 p.m.—
I fear I'll have to move. The
woman next to me has halitosis. I
don't mind that. The woman next
to me has 80. I don't mind that. The
woman next to me has thick ankles.
I don't mind that. The woman next
to me is chewing gum, and gawd, I
can't stand the flavor.
Indians Draw Navy
10 p.m.—
1 found a Stanford woman. She
found two sailors.. We disposed of a
snoring Hindu sitting next to the
Stanford woman. All's well again.
We're playing slap, a snappy little
card game in which all of, the players
hurl cards upon a common stack un
til two consecutive cards of the same
number appear. Then all of the
players slap the stack. The man be
hind us showed his ugly nature by
complaining when his ear was man
gled in the chaos of the last slap.

However, Sailor No. 1 locked the
man in the garbage box in the vesti
bule with the Hindu.
12 p.m.—
More slap. The garbage box in the
vestibule is becoming crowded with
complainers.
Navy Grows Sleepy
January 7, 2 a.m.—
This game is fascinating. However,
I wish that Sailor No. 2 would take
the toothpicks from between his eye
lids. It's giving some sort of a com
plex.
4 a.m.—
I'm back at my own scat. The
Hindu escaped from the garbage box
and threatened me with a knife. I
took the hint and moved. Sleep, oh
sleep, how can I find thee with
thoughts of slap pressing upon me.
Roble! Why'd I ever leave?
