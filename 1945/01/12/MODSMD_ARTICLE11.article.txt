# Play Contest To Continue
## 
### 
The Ram's Head annual play-writ
ing contest will continue throughout
the whole of Winter Quarter this
year instead of the first month only
as has been the rule. This new sys
tem will allow all Stanford authors
sufficient time to have their manu
scripts in good shape by the second
week in March. But if any students
have original manuscripts already
completed, they may turn them in
now to Corky Wollman at MAnzanita
or the Dramatic Manager's office,
Room 2 of the Old Union.
Any type of a play will be accept
able as there are no restrictions on
themes. The plays may be trage
dies, comedies, musicals, one acts,
two acts, or three acts. A play read
ing committee composed of Lois Wil
liams, Janice Shaughnessy, Rene
Zentner, Johnny High, Peggy Fitts,
and Corky Wollman will read the
submitted plays over spring vacation
and the winners will be announced
at the beginning of next quarter.
The authors of the prize winning
plays will receive automatic mem
bership in Ram's Head and will be
afforded the pleasure of seeing their
own writings presented on the stage
of Memorial Hall.
