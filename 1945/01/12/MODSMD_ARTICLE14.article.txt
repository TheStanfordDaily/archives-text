Old Stanford students from Bran

welcome, according to Patty Patten
and Bill Snow, chairman of the Pre-
Reg urogram.

dance music by the "best bands in
j the land" is promised.
"This is an opportunity for all new
students to become acquainted with
each other and with old Stanford
students," Miss Patten said. "We
hope you'll all be at the Nitery to
night."
Members of the Pre Reg Commit
