Peace-time Military Conscription
What a blessing is a closed mind at a time like
this. How nice it is to have a mother, father, or
anyone who can give us the right answers,
because witness the plight of most people these
days.
Last night two Stanford Veterans of World
War II and two Stanford professors were mem
bers of a panel discussion at the All Saints'
Episcopal Church in Palo Alto concerning post
war military conscription law; the President of
the United States has discussed a broad plan
for "some kind" of conscription; and the War
Department has approved a strictly military con
scription law.
It's clear that this law, for that strange time in
infinity—'peacetime"—is taking up the time of
a lot of people these days. A lot of off-hand
discussion about this matter is that "strictly mil
itary" training is perhaps a useful thing but
compulsory anything is bad to put in the hands
of politicians, especially in peacetime.
A student just back from working with wound
ed veterans, however, reveals that when a
bunch of wounded marines were told the na
ture of the opposition to military training, their
only reaction was to laugh—very grimly—and
'urn away.
Let's remember some things as this discussion
continues. Those who do not take time to fol
low the formulation and purpose of this "national
issue are not realizing a responsibility to young
men and their nation 10 or 15 years hence. If
that seems just too many years to worry about,
consider what it could have meant, if 10 or 15
years ago people had made the time and the
effort, as four of our number made last night,
to arrive at the right decision about the League
of Nations, the burden of German reparations,
and Russia's pleas for collective security.
The United States has dealt some hard blows
to isolationism with the war, but like intoler
ance it is a human attribute of the lazy or narrow
mind that will never be completely stamped
out. Stronger and stronger blows must be
dealt as the United States assumes a leading
role in financing and administering with other
responsible nations the means and programs for
world condition sthat will make peace possible.
These conditions necessarily include the
ability to enforce the decisions of nations that
we consider working in the interests of a just
peace. We must be strong to do this and it will
take exceptional training to make us so, as
technigues of warfare progress for another gen
eration.
When we realistically expect that we will
again be engaged in war, we must see the ne
cessity for going to the scene of disagreement
before it can again spread across the European,
Asiatic, and African continents and to the shores
•)f Pacific islands.
It is impossible to say that we can create a
'strictly military" program. There are always
social and educational aspects involved when
/oung men are trained on a huge scale. Cer
'ainly any man that you know who trained lor
his war was affected in his social attitudes,
and usually gained a broader and valued out
'ook, even if the immediate contacts were un
oleasant.
On this ground there is an argument that
raining that is "strictly" military in peacetime
s perhaps just what we do not want. The mili

tary can be forgiven lor sending Northern Ne- |
groes to Tennessee for training in wartime, but
could this and similar causes of friction be over- j
looked in peacetime?
Who then would assume the responsibility
for the training of an Army that has minds that
think as well as arms to shoot with. Of course
it's the federal government. And why is it not
possible to place this training under a non
political, independent body like those which
have made possible the achievements of the
Securities Exchange Commission and the Na
tional Labor Relations Board.
This is an issue on which we must be es
pecially careful to forget skeletons in the closet
and do effective thinking. This democratic j
country is young and its institutions can at- 1
tain great fairness when the decisions of the
people are known. This makes it imperative
that thinking people arrive at these decisions
and know about those who are trying to.
