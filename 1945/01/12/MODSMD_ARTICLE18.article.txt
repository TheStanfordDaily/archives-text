### Walrus the Carpenter 
It is not without trepidation that the average student 1
of the humanities approaches that august quarter of
the Quad which houses the mysteries of Physics. What
powerful and mysterious qualities of mind are com
bined in the frail form of the physicist, who arouses
feelings like those inspired by Goldsmith's village j
schoolmaster.
And still they gazed and still the wonder grew
That one small head could carry all he knew.
The genial Dr. Chapman is well known both to the j
freshmen and to the more advanced students. But j
perhaps the exciting nature of his latest researches is I
not as well known. The harmless drudge who writes ;
this column can make no pretense at knowing relativity !
or non-Euclidean geometry, without which Dr. Chap
man disdains to discuss his work, but he is at least able {
to describe what is plainly set in front of his eyes.
Dr. Chapman's laboratory is filled with weird appa
ratus and an impressive, collection of books. I found
the young scientist busy in a corner and rather in
clined to be abrupt.
"Would you mind removing your foot from what |
remains of my galvanometer?" he began.
"I am from the Daily ..." I blurted forth inad- j
visedly.
"That is an extenuating circumstance," he admit- j
ted, "but even a Daily reporter is expected to keep his i
eyes open to a certain extent; enough at least to avoid j
the ordinary hazards of everyday life." As he spoke he j
grasped me firmly by the arm and started walking j
toward the door.
"But wait a bit. The readers of my column in to
morrow's Daily are anxious to know about what is
going on around here. I have heard that you are get- |
■ting some interesting results in your researches."
"Don't mention it,"he groaned. "As you are prob
ably aware I am what is commonly known as a pure 1
scientist. A pure scientist deals only with ideas. The I
mere thought of anything practical or useful is anath- ;
ema to him. In spite of this, once in a while a practical 1
result turns up. Do you see this equation?"
He shoved a scrap of paper in front of me. It ap
peared to be covered with meaningless symbols.
"This equation," he continued gloomily, "is the j
result of a theory on the fourth dimension that has i
occupied my time for the last five years. I got it per
fected only two days ago when the students were away
and there was some blessed quiet on the campus. But '
look at it . . ." I looked at it. It seemed the same as j
before.
"When I substitute the proper dimensions I get an !
extraordinary result. Watch this!" Dr. Chapman
grabbed a slide-rule and started muttering to himself. ;
"Integrating from 1945 to 2000," it sounded like, "sub
stitute the dimensions of a book, say ten inches by
eight by three, buzz, buzz, buzz . . ." He suddenly j
snapped the slide-rule with a triumphant bang. At j
that precise moment I saw lying on the table a book j
that certainly had not been there before.
"See this book? That is the result of my equation. !
By substituting dimensions I find that I can pull books
right out of the Library of Congress."
My jaw dropped open! Dr. Chapman observed my
astonishment with grim amusement.
"Not only that," he said, "but books published in
the year 2000 A.D. By a transposition of space-time j
co-ordinates in x-phases . . ."
But I was no longer listening. Boy, what a scoop!
Dr. Chapman was scowling. "This sort of thing is
very disturbing. The librarian of Congress in the (
year 2000 is going to be as mad as a boiled owl. Be
sides the whole thing is only a toy, of no scientific
value."
With an abrupt gesture he tore his formula across
and threw it into the waste-basket.
I grabbed the book that he had brought out of the
year 2000. "May I have it?" He nodded moodily.
"And clear out of here!" he grunted.
This volume, expectant reader, is a volume of 1
memoirs. They at the memoirs of John Bell, the
forty-second Preside.:, of the United States. And 1
am proud to be able to announce that John Bell was
(or rather, is) a Stanford man. In this column, in ,
the near future, I propose to reprint those portions oi j
his memoirs that deal with his days at Stanford.

"Would you mind removing your foot from what |
remains of my galvanometer?" he began.
"I am from the Daily ..." I blurted forth inad- j
visedly.
"That is an extenuating circumstance," he admit- j
ted, "but even a Daily reporter is expected to keep his i
eyes open to a certain extent; enough at least to avoid j
the ordinary hazards of everyday life." As he spoke he j
grasped me firmly by the arm and started walking j
toward the door.
"But wait a bit. The readers of my column in to
morrow's Daily are anxious to know about what is
going on around here. I have heard that you are get- |
■ting some interesting results in your researches."
"Don't mention it,"he groaned. "As you are prob
ably aware I am what is commonly known as a pure 1
scientist. A pure scientist deals only with ideas. The I
mere thought of anything practical or useful is anath- ;
ema to him. In spite of this, once in a while a practical 1
result turns up. Do you see this equation?"
He shoved a scrap of paper in front of me. It ap
peared to be covered with meaningless symbols.
"This equation," he continued gloomily, "is the j
result of a theory on the fourth dimension that has i
occupied my time for the last five years. I got it per
fected only two days ago when the students were away
and there was some blessed quiet on the campus. But '
look at it . . ." I looked at it. It seemed the same as j
before.
"When I substitute the proper dimensions I get an !
extraordinary result. Watch this!" Dr. Chapman
grabbed a slide-rule and started muttering to himself. ;
"Integrating from 1945 to 2000," it sounded like, "sub
stitute the dimensions of a book, say ten inches by
eight by three, buzz, buzz, buzz . . ." He suddenly j
snapped the slide-rule with a triumphant bang. At j
that precise moment I saw lying on the table a book j
that certainly had not been there before.
"See this book? That is the result of my equation. !
By substituting dimensions I find that I can pull books
right out of the Library of Congress."
My jaw dropped open! Dr. Chapman observed my
astonishment with grim amusement.
"Not only that," he said, "but books published in
the year 2000 A.D. By a transposition of space-time j
co-ordinates in x-phases . . ."
But I was no longer listening. Boy, what a scoop!
Dr. Chapman was scowling. "This sort of thing is
very disturbing. The librarian of Congress in the (
year 2000 is going to be as mad as a boiled owl. Be
sides the whole thing is only a toy, of no scientific
value."
With an abrupt gesture he tore his formula across
and threw it into the waste-basket.
I grabbed the book that he had brought out of the
year 2000. "May I have it?" He nodded moodily.
"And clear out of here!" he grunted.
This volume, expectant reader, is a volume of 1
memoirs. They at the memoirs of John Bell, the
forty-second Preside.:, of the United States. And 1
am proud to be able to announce that John Bell was
(or rather, is) a Stanford man. In this column, in ,
the near future, I propose to reprint those portions oi j
his memoirs that deal with his days at Stanford.
It is not without trepidation that the average student 1
of the humanities approaches that august quarter of
the Quad which houses the mysteries of Physics. What
powerful and mysterious qualities of mind are com
bined in the frail form of the physicist, who arouses
feelings like those inspired by Goldsmith's village j
schoolmaster.
And still they gazed and still the wonder grew
That one small head could carry all he knew.
The genial Dr. Chapman is well known both to the j
freshmen and to the more advanced students. But j
perhaps the exciting nature of his latest researches is I
not as well known. The harmless drudge who writes ;
this column can make no pretense at knowing relativity !
or non-Euclidean geometry, without which Dr. Chap
man disdains to discuss his work, but he is at least able {
to describe what is plainly set in front of his eyes.
Dr. Chapman's laboratory is filled with weird appa
ratus and an impressive, collection of books. I found
the young scientist busy in a corner and rather in
clined to be abrupt.

result turns up. Do you see this equation?"
He shoved a scrap of paper in front of me. It ap
peared to be covered with meaningless symbols.
"This equation," he continued gloomily, "is the j
result of a theory on the fourth dimension that has i
occupied my time for the last five years. I got it per
fected only two days ago when the students were away
and there was some blessed quiet on the campus. But '
look at it . . ." I looked at it. It seemed the same as j
before.
"When I substitute the proper dimensions I get an !
extraordinary result. Watch this!" Dr. Chapman
grabbed a slide-rule and started muttering to himself. ;
"Integrating from 1945 to 2000," it sounded like, "sub
stitute the dimensions of a book, say ten inches by
eight by three, buzz, buzz, buzz . . ." He suddenly j
snapped the slide-rule with a triumphant bang. At j
that precise moment I saw lying on the table a book j
that certainly had not been there before.
"See this book? That is the result of my equation. !
By substituting dimensions I find that I can pull books
right out of the Library of Congress."
My jaw dropped open! Dr. Chapman observed my
astonishment with grim amusement.
"Not only that," he said, "but books published in
the year 2000 A.D. By a transposition of space-time j
co-ordinates in x-phases . . ."
But I was no longer listening. Boy, what a scoop!
Dr. Chapman was scowling. "This sort of thing is
very disturbing. The librarian of Congress in the (
year 2000 is going to be as mad as a boiled owl. Be
sides the whole thing is only a toy, of no scientific
value."
With an abrupt gesture he tore his formula across
and threw it into the waste-basket.
I grabbed the book that he had brought out of the
year 2000. "May I have it?" He nodded moodily.
"And clear out of here!" he grunted.
This volume, expectant reader, is a volume of 1
memoirs. They at the memoirs of John Bell, the
forty-second Preside.:, of the United States. And 1
am proud to be able to announce that John Bell was
(or rather, is) a Stanford man. In this column, in ,
the near future, I propose to reprint those portions oi j
his memoirs that deal with his days at Stanford.
