# Enemy Flees; La Roche Won

### 
PARIS, Friday, Jan. 12 (UP).—Al
lied armies Thursday drove the en
emy halfway back from the Ar
dennes bulge, captured La Roche,
to knock out the northern front of
the salient and cut off large enemy
forces trying to fiee the south flank
below Bastogne, killing or capturing
hundreds of enemy troops.
American airborne troops on the
north wing of the Allied pincer of
fensive also closed within one mile
of the German land escape road
through the waist of the salient and
the enemy withdrawals became a
full-fiedged retreat through the nar
row corridor.
Berlin admitted abandonment of
all positions west of the river Ourthe
representing a 30-mile pullback from
the peak of Marshal von Runstedt's
winter drive. The German flank
forces joined the retirement Thurs
day and this led to perhaps the big
gest single enemy loss of the cam
paign as Lt. Gen. George S. Patton's
Third Army manipulated a squeeze
play on enemy troops near Luxem
bourg.
With the Sixth Army division ex
erting heavy pressure from the
south and west, doughboys of the
35th Infantry crossed the enemy re
treat road near the Luxembourg
village of Doncols, six miles east of
Bastogne, and wiped out a large
enemy column. Many Germans were
killed and at least 400 captured.
As Panzers, mobile guns, and
truckloads of troops fled east and
northeast in mounting numbers
through the main part of the bulge,
American artillerymen laid down a
heavy, interlocking barrage across
the gap and airmen took advantage
of a rare burst of sunlight to attack
the packed enemy columns.
