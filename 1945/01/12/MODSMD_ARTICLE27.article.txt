# OUR HASHER

### JOE SHER 
Supposedly safe from the trials
and rigors of war, many of the men
who are remaining on campus to
maintain the remnants of a fair ratio
are hearing reverberations from the
Potomac in regard to their future
work and play.
Should some of the proposed legis
lation go through, the Stanford male
remnants will pack up and be off,
not to the fight and action of war,
but to the defense plants and ditches
of the labor battalions.
From Reading to Rivets
They will be exposed not to the
bullets and shells of battle, but to
the sweaters of women aircraft
workers and the points of the torches
of the welders and riveters of Lock
heed. They will be equipped not
with a trusty rifle, but with the
handy old pick and shovel, which
will enable them to get down to
earthâ€”with vim and vigor.
Of course, the sudden increase of
blindness and physical disability has
nothing to do with (his news; for
the lads who were 4F before were
always this way, but only hid their
injuries and bore up bravely under
the terrific strain of the spots of the
highways and the byways.
Rustles?
The shuffling noise heard around
the campus is not some one dealing
a bridge hand but new leaves being
turned over by many a citizen of
the Farm in a silent resolution to do
much better.
The loudest part of this noise is
emanating from the Monroe Coke
and Bridge Club which now has been
renamed by its remaining members
as the "Monroe Book in the Hand Is
Worth Two in the Closet Club."
Defeat's Admitted
This column is getting harder to
write all the time, for in the back of
my fertile mind there are a lot of
good ideas, only the censorship is so
darn still that I can't put them into
print. I wish something would hap
pen.
I would write about Charlie and
the failure of blood tests, but then
nobody is interested in that type, of
stuff, so that is out.
Even the Daily
The Daily staff itself is sending our
urgent calls for help. I wish I knew
where they are getting their news,
for they want plenty of reporters and
copyreaders to handle the work. The
pay is very good and the hours not
too long. Pay is nothing and the
hours about d couple a day. The
chief difficulty is whether one is al
lergic to long whips and hot pokers.
Not that the editors would drive
one, but they have gentle little ways
of persuasion, such as the rack and
the iron boot. Basically, they're nice
boys and girls. I put that "boys" in
for the benefit of the few on the staff
who are so outnumbered that they
are developing neurosis of one sort
or another.
I should rack up, but the editor
said that I should fill up space and,
besides, my mother was frightened
by a typewriter and I have never
gotton over it. Not that the editor
has me bluffed, but when I get this
column completed I get this big chain
taken off my leg and my Orphan
Annie decoder pin given back.
