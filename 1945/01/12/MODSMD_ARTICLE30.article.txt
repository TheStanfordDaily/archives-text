# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL GILBERT 
Well, now, the Daily has asked a Chappie man to write a
guest Bull Session. As if that weren't peculiar enough, they
didn't ask that it be "comical." So, grasping the consequences
in both hands, here goes.
We hear lots of talk about the Stanford Spirit, and how it
waned. I have been sort of kicking the thought around for
some time; herewith is what gave out.
To me, the spirit that makes Stanford great is a spirit of
hardihood, of strength, of manhood. When I came here (the
memory of man runneth not so far), I first got a feeling of chal
lenge; here were men of real intellectual accomplishment, pre
pared to show me what cooked in any field I chose. And yet,
wonder of wonders, none of them tried to ram knowledge of
any kind down my throat. The idea was that here was a defi
nitely superior community of people, willing to help anyone
who could come in in with them, but equally willing to drop him
if he didn't care to do most of the work on his own. It was at
once a new, heady freedom from the necessarily coercive sort
of education by parents and grammar school, and a challenge to
use that freedom to make a man of myself. And anyone who
couldn't assimilate the freedom or accept the challenge was
quietly, and totally without rancor, "dropped off the edge of
the campus." This spirit prevailed in every possible University
activity. . \
A very great modern teacher and anthropologist (E. L. Hew
ett) in a recent monograph says, "To me the ideal teacher is an
explorer, a good scout, who says, 'If we don't know, we'll go
and find out.' He is simply a leader in the endless quest for the
truth about things . . . going to nature ... to find the way of
life that is free from prejudice and personal opinion." That
theory of education is, I think, the main ingredient of the Stanford
Spirit; it must have been what Senator Stanford meant when he
promised "a University of high degree."
The opposite philosophy of education (and of all social life)
is expressed by Dr. Hewett this way: "an age-old method of
guiding the human mind has been by mandate . . . The authori
tative statement, backed by the power of great organizations,
supported by man's normal tendency to adhere to tradition—
these forces have induced a type of mind impervious to reason,
immovable under changing conditions, intolerant of opposition,
atisfied with dogma." It is an interesting comparison.
These are firiles of emotional and physical instability. I hope
J may be forgiven for using the privilege of the soon-to-depart,
and admonish the University to do anything and everything to
maintain the Stanford Spirit unchanged. "lust here I wish to
denounce the idea that we are living in a whirlwind of change,
that whether we like it or not, everything is changing—must
change—family life, economics, government, morality . . ." (I
hope Dr. Hewett won't mind my quoting so much.) I hope the
clouds of war won't obscure, or be used to obscure, departures
from the basic Stanford tenets of freedom, research and chal
lenge. If such departures come, Stanford will cease to be a
University of high degree, and become just another college.
And that is enough for the moment.

To me, the spirit that makes Stanford great is a spirit of
hardihood, of strength, of manhood. When I came here (the
memory of man runneth not so far), I first got a feeling of chal
lenge; here were men of real intellectual accomplishment, pre
pared to show me what cooked in any field I chose. And yet,
wonder of wonders, none of them tried to ram knowledge of
any kind down my throat. The idea was that here was a defi
nitely superior community of people, willing to help anyone
who could come in in with them, but equally willing to drop him
if he didn't care to do most of the work on his own. It was at
once a new, heady freedom from the necessarily coercive sort
of education by parents and grammar school, and a challenge to
use that freedom to make a man of myself. And anyone who
couldn't assimilate the freedom or accept the challenge was
quietly, and totally without rancor, "dropped off the edge of
the campus." This spirit prevailed in every possible University
activity. . \
A very great modern teacher and anthropologist (E. L. Hew
ett) in a recent monograph says, "To me the ideal teacher is an
explorer, a good scout, who says, 'If we don't know, we'll go
and find out.' He is simply a leader in the endless quest for the
truth about things . . . going to nature ... to find the way of
life that is free from prejudice and personal opinion." That
theory of education is, I think, the main ingredient of the Stanford
Spirit; it must have been what Senator Stanford meant when he
promised "a University of high degree."
The opposite philosophy of education (and of all social life)
is expressed by Dr. Hewett this way: "an age-old method of
guiding the human mind has been by mandate . . . The authori
tative statement, backed by the power of great organizations,
supported by man's normal tendency to adhere to tradition—
these forces have induced a type of mind impervious to reason,
immovable under changing conditions, intolerant of opposition,
atisfied with dogma." It is an interesting comparison.
These are firiles of emotional and physical instability. I hope
J may be forgiven for using the privilege of the soon-to-depart,
and admonish the University to do anything and everything to
maintain the Stanford Spirit unchanged. "lust here I wish to
denounce the idea that we are living in a whirlwind of change,
that whether we like it or not, everything is changing—must
change—family life, economics, government, morality . . ." (I
hope Dr. Hewett won't mind my quoting so much.) I hope the
clouds of war won't obscure, or be used to obscure, departures
from the basic Stanford tenets of freedom, research and chal
lenge. If such departures come, Stanford will cease to be a
University of high degree, and become just another college.
And that is enough for the moment.
Well, now, the Daily has asked a Chappie man to write a
guest Bull Session. As if that weren't peculiar enough, they
didn't ask that it be "comical." So, grasping the consequences
in both hands, here goes.
We hear lots of talk about the Stanford Spirit, and how it
waned. I have been sort of kicking the thought around for
some time; herewith is what gave out.
