To the Editor:
During the two-week period between last quarter and this, I worked
in a gas station in Phlo Alto. It opened my eyes to a great many attitudes
people in that locality have toward the rationing of gasoline.
I remember one incident in particular. A man drove in the station one
day with a shiny, black Buick—a 1942 model. The car had a nice *iet of
tires all the way around, and it looked as if it got excellent care. I filled
the tank for him and on ringing up the sale on the cash register he pulled
out two ration books filled with "A" and "C" coupons and gave me some
tickets. He then proceeded to tear the government apart, ci 'ming that
it was made up of a bunch of "nigger lovers" and "Jew lovers" and that
rationing only benefited them. The gall of this guy was that he wasn't
suffering himself and yet he was griping.
The thing that burned me in particular was his race prejudice—the
same old intolerant rationalization of making minority groups take the
brunt of his destructive criticism of the government.
There were other cases when drivers with plenty of gas stamps, good
tires, and nice looking cars came in cussing the O.P.A. But the outstanding
thing to be noticed was that most of the criticism came from those having
the most. Other people with far less allotted to them would often make the
remark: "I guess I am pretty lucky with what I have."
Maybe the O.P.A. has made many mistakes with gas rationing, but I
hate to think what it would be like if there wasn't any. The present
shortage of cigarettes is an example of what no rationing means, a few
people taking all.
