# New History Professor Tells of Mexican Life
## 
### USA EBBERTS 
In 1928 Dr. Rufus Kay Wyllys went to Mexico for quiet historical re
search. That same year President Obregon was assassinated, and respect
able Mexicans stayed prudently in their homes. In spite of disturbances.
Dr. Wyllys went ahead with his research and was one of the first Califor
nians to study in the Mexican state archives.

This year Dr. Wyllys is visiting
Stanford as Acting Assistant Pro
fessor of History, having just come
from Arizona Slate College where he
is Professor of History and Head of
the Department of Social Studies.
For two quarters he will lecture here
on Latin-American history.
Holder of Degrees
He has studied that subject exten
sively, holding a series of degrees
from Hillsdale College, University of
Michigan, and the University of Cali
ornia.
He has supplimented classroom
study by traveling through Latin
America a great deal, beginning with
a traveling fellowship from the Uni
versity of California in 1928.
Nor has all his research been in
libraries and archives, for he believes
in "getting the feel of a country"
through the people. He has traded in
their mercados, traveled on their
river boats, visited their ruins, and
spoken with them in his limping
Spanish. He likes the people's sim

plicity and friendliness when met
half way.
Favors Mcxico
He feels this is especially true in
Mexico, which is his favorite of all
the countries he has visited. And he
has been to a great many nations in
both Central and South America and
Europe.
Writer of Books
Dr. Wyllys has already published
two books, "The French in Sonora,"
in 1932, and "Pioneer Padre" in 1935.
A third is now in press, "A History
of the American West."
His Latin - American trips have
been strenuous, but he was well pre
pared for them by his Sierra hiking
and mountain-climbing and by his
numerous Canadian fishing trips.
"Most of all," he chuckled, "by the
waterfront beat I once covered as a
Toledo reporter."
Since the war, Dr. Wyllys has not
traveled so much, but when peace is
declared, he intends to take the first
train io Mexico.

study by traveling through Latin
America a great deal, beginning with
a traveling fellowship from the Uni
versity of California in 1928.
Nor has all his research been in
libraries and archives, for he believes
in "getting the feel of a country"
through the people. He has traded in
their mercados, traveled on their
river boats, visited their ruins, and
spoken with them in his limping
Spanish. He likes the people's sim

plicity and friendliness when met
half way.
Favors Mcxico
He feels this is especially true in
Mexico, which is his favorite of all
the countries he has visited. And he
has been to a great many nations in
both Central and South America and
Europe.
Writer of Books
Dr. Wyllys has already published
two books, "The French in Sonora,"
in 1932, and "Pioneer Padre" in 1935.
A third is now in press, "A History
of the American West."
His Latin - American trips have
been strenuous, but he was well pre
pared for them by his Sierra hiking
and mountain-climbing and by his
numerous Canadian fishing trips.
"Most of all," he chuckled, "by the
waterfront beat I once covered as a
Toledo reporter."
Since the war, Dr. Wyllys has not
traveled so much, but when peace is
declared, he intends to take the first
train io Mexico.
