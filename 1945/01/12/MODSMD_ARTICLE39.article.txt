"Paintings from the studio of Clar
ence Hinle of Southern California are
now on exhibition at the University
Art Gallery," according to Pedro de
Lemos, director of the Museum and
Art Gallery.

He explained that the paintings
are produced with varying mediums,
mainly with oil paint, but tempera
paint is combined in several of the
subjects permitting a more sponta
neous technique. "The results," he
commented, "of these combined me
diums have attracted much atten
tion among the art public as well as
among artists."
Clarence Hinle's paintings have
been nationally exhibited and
awarded many prizes. The Pennsyl
vania Academy, National Academy,
New York; Museum of Modern Art,
New York; Albright Gallery; Buf
falo Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg,
and the Chicago Art Institute are
among the prominent galleries which
have exhibited his paintings.
The exhibition will be shown every
day in January from 10 to 5, and
the admittance is free.
