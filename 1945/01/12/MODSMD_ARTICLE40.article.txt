Pictures and documents of Senator
Lelancl Stanford's famous stockfarm
for breeding of horses are on display
in the library this week, affording
students and faculty an opportunity
to become acquainted with the Stan
ford Farm's picturesque history, pre
vious to the founding of the Univer
sity. Senator Stanford was pro
foundly interested in the breeding of
good horses, for in the day when
horses were the only motive power
for travel, he believed that more
work-efficiency from the animal
could be realized if a better grade
were bred.
Bought Mayfield Grange
In 187(5 he purchased the Mayfield
Grange farm of 650 acres adjacent to
San Franeisquito Creek, which was
to be the nucleus of Stanford Uni
versity; and he purchased neighbor
ing ranches during the next few
years until there were over 8.000
acres of land with magnificent build
ings and stables. Trotters, world
renowned in his day, were bred un
der the careful guidance of ranch
personnel.
Included in the library exhibit are
a map of the ranch as it was in Sena
tor Stanford's day; pictures and doc
uments of the Frenchman's ranch,
including Escondite cottage, French
man's Lake, the ranch itself, and the
Frenchman, Peter Coutt; Senator
Stanford's famous Muybridge motion
pictures, and pictures and documents
of Senator Stanford's ranch as it used
to be.
Made Movie Experiments
The Muybridge motion picture ex
periments were particularly interest
ing, for Senator Stanford proved that
a horse while in motion can lift all
of its feet from the ground at one
time. A battery of 12 cameras was
placed in a line beside the horses and
strings, attached to the shutters were
stretched across the tracks. The
horses in motion broke the strings
operating the cameras and took pos
sibly the first motion pictures ever
made.
Mission Planned
Few people are aware that the
Spanish missionaries under Father
Palau attempted to found a mission
on the Farm. While passing through,
he observed the beauty and peace
of the landscape under the purple,
cloud-flaked hills and decided that
here would be an ideal place for a
mission, so he sent a party of soldiers
to Father Serra at Monterey to in
form him of this plan. An expedition
was sent to this site from Monterey.
However, when the party arrived,
the landscape had become dry, bar
ren and less pleasant. The project
was abandoned as a result, and Mis
sion Santa Clara was established in
stead.

strings, attached to the shutters were
stretched across the tracks. The
horses in motion broke the strings
operating the cameras and took pos
sibly the first motion pictures ever
made.
Mission Planned
Few people are aware that the
Spanish missionaries under Father
Palau attempted to found a mission
on the Farm. While passing through,
he observed the beauty and peace
of the landscape under the purple,
cloud-flaked hills and decided that
here would be an ideal place for a
mission, so he sent a party of soldiers
to Father Serra at Monterey to in
form him of this plan. An expedition
was sent to this site from Monterey.
However, when the party arrived,
the landscape had become dry, bar
ren and less pleasant. The project
was abandoned as a result, and Mis
sion Santa Clara was established in
stead.
Pictures and documents of Senator
Lelancl Stanford's famous stockfarm
for breeding of horses are on display
in the library this week, affording
students and faculty an opportunity
to become acquainted with the Stan
ford Farm's picturesque history, pre
vious to the founding of the Univer
sity. Senator Stanford was pro
foundly interested in the breeding of
good horses, for in the day when
horses were the only motive power
for travel, he believed that more
work-efficiency from the animal
could be realized if a better grade
were bred.
Bought Mayfield Grange
In 187(5 he purchased the Mayfield
Grange farm of 650 acres adjacent to
San Franeisquito Creek, which was
to be the nucleus of Stanford Uni
versity; and he purchased neighbor
ing ranches during the next few
years until there were over 8.000
acres of land with magnificent build
ings and stables. Trotters, world
renowned in his day, were bred un
der the careful guidance of ranch
personnel.
Included in the library exhibit are
a map of the ranch as it was in Sena
tor Stanford's day; pictures and doc
uments of the Frenchman's ranch,
including Escondite cottage, French
man's Lake, the ranch itself, and the
Frenchman, Peter Coutt; Senator
Stanford's famous Muybridge motion
pictures, and pictures and documents
of Senator Stanford's ranch as it used
to be.
Made Movie Experiments
The Muybridge motion picture ex
periments were particularly interest
ing, for Senator Stanford proved that
a horse while in motion can lift all
of its feet from the ground at one
time. A battery of 12 cameras was
placed in a line beside the horses and
strings, attached to the shutters were
stretched across the tracks. The
horses in motion broke the strings
operating the cameras and took pos
sibly the first motion pictures ever
made.
