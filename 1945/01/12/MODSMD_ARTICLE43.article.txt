## 
### 
"Just to the right inside of the
Shack; the time is 1:30 Sunday after
noon, and you of the Daily Biz Staff
had *!&â™¦'! well better be there," ac
cording to Nancy Tilden, acting busi
ness manager.
"We gotta get organized or I shall
go mad," continued Miss Tilden,
tearing hair quietly from her head.
Business staff members include
advertising managers, circulation,
classified and billing managers, as
well as office workers and advertis
ing salesmen.
"We particularly want to see those
of you who have forgotten us of late,"
she went on, shuffling through the
blue cards, with the names of dozens
of people she had never seen before.
As an afterthought she added in a
very small voice indeed, "Please
come, won'tcha?"
