# Chemists Face New Possibilities

(Editorial note: This is another
in a series on heads of Stanford
departments.)
By JIM JACKMAN
Dr. George Sutton Parks, acting
head of the Chemistry Department,
has been at Stanford the longest of
anyone in his department. Dr. Parks
came to the Farm as professor of
hemistry in 1920 and has been here
ever since, 25 years.
In peace times, Dr. Parks is in
charge of undergraduate physical
chemistry and he is acting as head
of the department in the absence of
Philip A. Leighton, who is a lieu
tenant-colonel in the Army Chemi
cal Warfare Division.
Washington Grad
Parks received his Bachelor of
Science degree from the University
of Washington in 1915 and his Mas
ter's there the following year. At
Cal in 1919 he earned his Doctor's
degree, after working during World
War I at the Hercules Powder Com
pany.
He was instructor in chemistry at
the California Institute of Technol
ogy from 1919 to 1920, when he came
to the Farm. He was born and
raised outside of Tacoma, Wash.
Guggenheim Fellow
From 1927 to 1931 he acted as di
rector of the American Petroleum
Institute Research Project 29, and
later, in 1932, received the Guggen
heim Fellowship for study in Europe.
"After the war, the Chemistry De
partment has plans to complete a
chemical engineering section," Dr.
Parks said. This project was begun
just before the war, and the Army
sent 15 advanced chem engineers to
study in the embryo division. The
Board of Trustees appropriated
$7,000 to "get going on." However,
â– hen the ASTP was largely dis
solved last spring, these men were
removed, and it remains for the
post-war period to develop the
chemical engineering department
fully.
Stanford Opportunity
"There is a real opportunity for
Stanford in this field, as Cal has no
chem engineering curriculum ei
ther, and chemical industries will
be increased tremendously after the
war. Men trained in the engineering
aspect will be in large demand,"
said Dr. Parks.
Chemistry itself is becoming in
creasingly important during the war,
and will be more so after the war, he
said. "Man is still competing with
nature, and finding that many of his
synthetic products are better than
the product they substitute for. No
table examples are synthetic rubber
and plastics.
"And in gasoline, for instance,
whereas a decade ago we could only
utilize a comparatively small part of
petroleum for this fuel, today we
can convert most of the raw prod

uct into gasoline. There is a gen
eral tendnecy to realize, through
eral tendency to realize, through
tentialities of raw materials," Dr.
Parks said.
Big Things" in Chemistry
Also in organic and biochemistry,
big things are on the way, and in
the fields of dehydration and vita
min research possibilities are al
most unlimited, according to Dr.
Pafks.
The Stanford Chemistry Depart
ment has alumni in war chemical in
dustries all over the country.
Among the department's more di
rect contributions to the war effort,
five important government research
projects are being conducted in
Stanford laboratories, and two have
already been completed, Parks dis
closed. They concern such vital
subjects as malarial control and
blood plasma. Other research prob
lems are military secrets, dealing
with aspects of chemical warfare, he
said.
A project has been completed
dealing with vitamins from shark
liver and a number of years have
been spent studying the virus of
poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis).
Stanford has received national rec
ognition and grants for this study.
A Busy Chem Department
The Chemistry Department itself
is staffed by 12 faculty members.
This is somewhat less than the
peacetime staff, and "everyone is
kept busy," Dr. Parks said.
There are only about 20 graduate
students enrolled now, compared
with the 50 that have been regis
tered in pre-war years. Normally
there would be about 60 chemistry
majors, but these have shrunk to 12.
Dr. Parks said. However, there are
about 200 students in "starter"
courses; the chemistry division is
partly a service department for
medicine, engineering, physics, and
biology, he said. Graduate students
help teach these elementary courses
and advise in the labs.
Also, there are 97 pre-med Army
students taking advanced chemistry
courses, and 110 17-year-olds in
starter courses. Last year, however,
the department had 1500 chemistry
students, according to Dr. Parks.
"Although the department has few
civilian students now, we expect
even larger enrollments after the
war," said Dr. Parks.
