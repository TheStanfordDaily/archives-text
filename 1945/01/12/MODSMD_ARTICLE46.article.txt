# Casabamen Ready To Begin Season
## 
### OEWEY VIASTICK 
Three more teams today were add
j ed to the intramural league which
! will swing into operation next week:
j Sequoia Hall, Arguello Cardinals,
| and Arguello Whites being the new
| teams. The league is shaping up
I nicely thus far, and it looks as if a
successful season is in preparation,
j As yet nothing is known as to the
j merit of the teams represented.
Saturday will be the deadline for
j all signups, the sheet being on the
bulletin board in Encina Gym. All
living groups and functioning or
ganizations are eligible for play and
j are urged to sign up so competition
can be campus-wide.
All games will be played in the
pavilion or Engina gym, according
Ito the schedule. Regulation rules
will be enforced, and the newly
! adopted rule of the AAU—five per
! sonal fouls for dismissal from the
j game —will be followed. Time of
j contests has not been settled as yet,
j but probably the 30-minute standard
will be used, with 15 minute halves.
Anyone wishing to officiate at
those contests should get in touch
! with Mr. Harry Wolter, intramural
I director, before Saturday. One dollar
| per hour will be paid to those sign
ing up for the job.
According to Mr. Wolter, basket
ball will be the only intramural
j sport vhis quarter.
