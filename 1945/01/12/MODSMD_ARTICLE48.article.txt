# Cage Team of Stanford Men Entered In NCBA League
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
Although Stanford is no longer
i represented on the basketball courts
of California, former Cardinal fans
! were recently given something to
i cheer about for the first time in a
| long time with the formation of Palo
j Alto Independents' cage squad. The
| independents, composed entirely of
j Stanford students, are an official
member of the Northern California
Basketball Association and have been
playing since the end of last quarter,
j They were organized and are now
[ being coached by med. students Dave
J Brown and Jack Heald, who last
j season entered Pacific Coast compe
! tition wearing the blue and'gold of
UCLA. Brown and Heald are also
co-captains of the squad.
At present the first string consists
i of: Morley Thompson, forward; Don
Bower, forward; Jack Heald, center;
Dave Brown, guard, and Red Pres
! eott, guard. Prescott is a member of
the AST unit. The team is also well
| stocked with reserves, including
! Chandler, forward and center; Pitts,
I guard; Ashley, guard; McDowell,
j forward; Fox, forward, and Rosburg,
, guard.
Good Record
So far in league competition the
Independents have split even, drop
ping their opener to the powerful
j Fleet City, 40 to 28, and then defeat
! ing Fort McDowell, itself one of the
I more potent cage outfits, 45 to 35.
! The Palo Altans have also won both
their non-league contests. In their

first appearance of the season the
Farm boys deleated Santa Clara to
the tune of 39-33, followed by a 43
to 42 victory over Auten's a previ
ously undefeated independent team
from Palo Alto.
HiÂ«h scorers for the season so far
are the sensational Dave Brown, with
20 points and Alorley Thompson with
11. Brown was last week named on
the San Francisco Chronicle's all
week-end NCBA team, an all-star
squad composed of the best players
in cage competition each week. His
consistent brilliance ranks him as
one of the best guards in NCBA com
petition. Thompson himself is no
slouch, and might be highest scorer
were it not for his absence from the
Auten's game, which was played
during the Christmas holidays.
Play Armed Guard
The Independents' next scheduled
opponent is the Treasure Island
Armed Guard, whom they play Sat
urday night in Kezar pavilion. The
Armed Guard is currently leading
the Navy "A" league in San Fran
cisco and is rated one of the tough
est teams on the coast.
The Palo Altans are currently try
ing to arrange a game with Califor
nia, but as yet no definite arrange
ment has been made.
