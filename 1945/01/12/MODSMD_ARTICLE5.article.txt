# Bunn Clarifies Draft Issues For Students
## 
### 
Although opportunities for fur
ther college education for 17- and
18-vear-olds have been slashed,
prospects that 4-F's attending Uni
versity will be allowed to continue
are good, according to a report to
Stanford men last night by Dean of
Men John Bunn.
"The only interest at present is in
those who have left their jobs since
December 12, 1944—n0t those who
are following work in education,"
the dean said.
Army and Navy college training
programs have been closed to ci
vilians except for the Eddy Radar
technician program, occasional op
portunities in the Naval Air Corps,
and the Merchant Marine Cadet pro
gram.
Advice to men of limited classifi
cation offered by Dean Bunn was
"if you are intex-ested in going on in
school and doing a good job, this is
the thing to do. If you feel you can
do something better—more impor
tant in your mind to your country's
future —you should do that."
In the discussion the Dean brought
out that speculation shows a Na
tional Service Act has little or no
chance of being passed, although
some phases of one may be ap
proved. Reason for present pressure
on 4-F's. Dean Bunn concluded, was
the attitude of war workers who
thought that the European war
would be over last year, and were
returning to non-essential work.
According to information obtained
by the Dean, there is no intent to
recall 4-F's for immediate re-exami
nation. The directive is aimed only
at "job-jumpers."
Little chance is held that Army
and Navy officials will approve a
lowering of physical standards as
the dominant opinion is that the
military has sufficient numbers of
this group.
Suggested for those now in war
industry planning to attend college
was the fact that they should ar
range approval through their local
boards before leaving industry.
