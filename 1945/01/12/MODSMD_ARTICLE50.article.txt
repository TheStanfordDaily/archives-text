# Top Feature Rates Bottom
## 
### 
A rather unorthodox double bill is
presented at the Stanford Theater
this week-end, in which the so
called second feature is decidedly
superior to the main attraction.
Abbott and Costello's newest bit
jf mugging, "Lost in a Harem," holds

top billing. This
time the two
roustabouts tear
around MGM's
Arabian Nights
lot in a new
and worse-than
usual assortment
of smaltz and
corn.
The pair, along
with peroxide
blonde Marilyn

Maxwell, become stranded in a Tar
iff land known only to Hollywood,
and delight certain elements of the
audience in their attempts to escape.
Their rough-house humor just didn't
jliek, however, with this reviewer,
vvho spent 89 minutes waiting for
'he thing to end.
Jimmy Dorsey and his band also
parade around and are featured in
one good tune, something about
'John Silver."
Paramount comes up with the in
eresting and engrossing second pic-

ture, "The Man
in Half Moon
Street," which,
in spit e of an
unknown cast
and a low budg
et production, is
excellently pre
sented.
''The Man in
Half M o on
Street" is a psy-

chological and at times a horror pic
ture which achieves its tense atmos
phere without relying upon the
usual Hollywood tricks. Nils Asther
has the title role of the man who
thinks that he has found the secret,
of everlasting life.
Coming Sunday to the Stanford is
charming Jean Parker in an appro
priately titled picture, "One Body
Too Many." Be sure and miss it.—
