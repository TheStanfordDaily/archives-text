# Geology Head 22 Years at Stanford
## 
### TED DRENTON 
Professor Eliot Blackwelder, pro-
Lessor of geology and head of the
Geology Department, has been
teaching at Stanford for 22 year's and
is continuing in instruction and re
search.
More students from this depart
ment than from any other institution
have been selected for work in the
United States Geological Survey,
\ principal branch of government con
j cerned with geology, because field
work is emphasized instead of mere
book knowledge, states Professor
Blackwelder. These men have done
very well in positions they have held.
Emphasis on Grad Work
Work in the department during
' earlier years was done largely by
undergraduate students, however,
during later years graduate work
has been increasingly emphasized
and twenty to thirty-five students
have been doing graduate work
every year.
The department specializes in sev
eral fields of instruction, namely
paleontology, which is a study of
fossils, and petrology, which is a
study of rocks. Seven men are asso
ciated with the staff at present.
In earlier years Professor J. C.
Branner covered the entire field of
geology before the department was
separated into different branches.
Dr. Branner Early Head
The department staff is closely
associated with the United States
Geological Survey, and this year
three members are doing work on
the survey, or are doing war work.

Professor Branner was associated
earliest with the organization and
Professor Blackwell was associated
with it for 12 years.
He has published a number of re
search papers, one book entitled "Re
gional Geology of the United States,"
and has collaborated in three other
books entitled respectively: "Report
of the Committee on Petroleum,"
"Elements of Geology," and "Re
search in China."
Blackwelder From Illinois
Before he came to Stanford in 1922
he instructed at the University of
Wisconsin, was head of the depart
ment at the University of Illinois, and
taught for short intervals at Harvard
and the University of Chicago.
He has done field work during
summers in Nevada, Wyoming, Utah,
Alaska, and other western states and
has spent a year in North China ex
ploring with a Carnegie Institution
research expedition.
He likes Stanford, for it is an in
stitution of high standards, though
of moderate size, and, of particular
interest, the school is located in an
excellent spot for geological field
work.
