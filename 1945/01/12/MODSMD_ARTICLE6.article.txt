Cardinals will present the first all

music has been guaranteed by the
contribution of an unusual collection
of records.

lice, has issued the call for men to
patrol the dance. Pay will be 60
cents an hour. Those interested
should phone Jenkins at 8771 or see
him at Washington Hall.
Tickets, at GO cents per couple, are
now on sale at the ASSU office, and
may also be purchased at the door
Saturday evening.
The following four patrons and
patronesses have been announced by
Chairman Carol Hurwitz:
Miss Rosamonde Clarke, Professor
Harold Bacon, Mr. and Mrs. Dayton
Phillips, and Mr. and Mrs. Richard
A. Ogg. Jr.
The Reg Dunce, traditionally the
first dance of each quarter, formerly
was presented registration night, and
is considered one of the biggest ac
tivities of the quarter, both for stu
dents and for Cardinals.
