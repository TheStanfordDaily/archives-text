# Peace Draft Divides Panel
## 
### 
Opinion on the value of peacetime
compulsory military training for
American youth was sharply divided
at a panel discussion held Thursday
evening at the All Saints Episcopal
parish house in Palo Alto.
The panel included two Stanford
students who of World
War llâ€”Solomon Dublin and George
Murphy. Dublin favored compulsory
training on the grounds that national
security was the only real issue.
Murphy opposed the plan as being
contrary to democratic procedure.
He said that the men fighting in the
South Pacific felt that their sacrifice
was being made to end the necessity
for conscription.
Several Palo Alto High School
students were on the panel. The dis
cussion was sponsored by a local
group made up of residents of the
Palo Alto-Stanford area.
