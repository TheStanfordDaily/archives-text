# MEASURE UP

We saw her watching the crowds outside the
postoffice at noon. She was one of the girls
you always see at 10:30 in the Cellar, or at the
Boathouse steps in the spring, or at Omar's in
the city. But today she looked a little uncer
tain, a little bit wondering of the Stanford stream
of life that went by and passed her on its way
to get the mail.
When we asked her, she said she had lost
her Measuring Stick. "Measuring Stick we
queried.
We talked for awhile and it seemed that she
vas in doubt, suddenly, as to what her status
vas compared to that of persons of her own
ige in other parts of the world . . . how her
life stacked up beside the lives of others. We
hink we've found her a Measuring Stick, and
orint it now. The excerpts concerning Chinese
students were taken from the November issue
it Asia mazagine.
CHINA . . . 500 male students of the National
Szechwan University petitioned the school
nuthorities last spring to allow them "to repair

and build the roads outside of class hours and
consider the labor more or less a part of our
extracurricular program," on condition that their
collective wages should be used as a supple
mentary food fund for the student body.
STANFORD . . . During the first week of
Winter Quarter only seven women students
volunteered to fold bandages at the Red Cross
Work Room in the Women's Clubhouse on cam
pus, an average of almost one woman per day.
Although the room is open for business every
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday until 4 1
p.m., six of the students were recruited at the
last minute by a residence director.
Here's your Measuring Stick.
