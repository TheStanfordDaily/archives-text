# Bull Session

### 
DID JA KNOW . . .

, . . That today's session (Reading Time: 20 sec.) in at
tempting to "scoop," as they say in celluloid pressrooms, '
the Stanford Daily on many items of worldwide interest j
and importance will probably cost me my bread and oleo ;
allotment for this week. But here goes.
. . . That the erupting hours of the Union Fountain are j
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. daily, including Sundays.
. . . That there are only 23 more days till Chappie.
. . . That Doug Dulac, campus spirit man, and Nakomas,
local Indian chief, are devising blueprints of a scheme to j
"spirit away" the Bender Room to the Mark Hopkins.
Authoritative sources reveal that should this earthshaking
feat be accomplished, the unprecedented popularity of
the new Bender Room of the Mark would threaten the in- \
come of the Wedgewood Room of the Waldorf-Astoria.
. . . That my roommate may she rest in peace went
plus thirty last guarter.
That P. O. Box 1551 has been condemned by the Sani- S
tation Board as well as by the Better Business Bureau as
a hygienic hazard. Reason: lack of incoming mail has j
caused a weighty dust, fibre, and amoeba collection to set- ;
on the combination (3 turns right to 9; 2 left to 30) j
and thus endanger the health of innocent letter readers in
the lobby.
I can't imagine what has happened to that Mary Roy ad
and my Bank Statement of Overdrawal
. . . That Stanford students are still smoking on their
Quads, inner, outer, and middle.
. . . That the new Sunday serial is "Phantom Empire," j
starring Gene (Don't Fence Me In) Autry. Can hardly
wait for Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Hope to save 20 cents by j
then.
. . . That the lake is filling. The lake is filling. We must j
go and tell Excom.
. . . That Roos Bios, the other Shack on Campus is !
supplying customers and Culbertsons with book covers
FREE.
. . . That Folk Dancing TThF at 8 a.m. is not so bad
after all.
. . . That Dick Bower, Daily Movie Reviewer, has prom- j
ised to venture out of his permanent box where he is now I
playing in the Varsity long enough to pen a guest Bull
Session later in the week.
. . . That Pounce double solitaire game is so lascin- j
ating as it's played by the Hurlburt gals.
. . . That the Committee of 23 has just passed on a spe
cial late leave to be used by seventh guarter Fiosh ex
clusively.
. . . That the Daily's circulation, although it tolals 4,900,
is still somewhat under that of the New York Daily News,
which boasts and very broadly so of 2,000,000 readers.
. . . That my window box should yield approximately
three opium drags per square inch of planted poppy seeds, j
And that's a lot of Poppy Crop!
