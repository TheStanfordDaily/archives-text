Military events still dominate the news, and one of the ;
main ones is the invasion of Luzon.
The island is shaped roughly like an egg, with a nar
row, boot like peninsula projecting from the southern end.
The battle on Luzon is. still in a formative stage, and
it is hard to say whether General Mac Arthur will make
new landings or be content with the foothold he has.
However, some new maneuvers on the Pacific front as a
whole are now distinctly probable.
These will center about the island of Formosa, which
cannot be ignored because it is a base for aircraft on our
rear. It is too difficult to invade directly because its coast
is unsuitable for landing craft and its interior is overrun
with headhunters.
It can be neutralized, however, by seizing one of the
Ryukyu islands in its rear. This might not have been
possible when we invaded Leyte, since the enemy, by !
massing his land-based aircraft on China, in his home j
islands, and on Formosa, might have overcomo his naval i
inferiority and beaten us. Now we have large land masses |
in the Philippines from which to c<* <â–  the operation with
aircraft, and the Japanese eet has bewn so far reduced that i
the move might be attempted.
