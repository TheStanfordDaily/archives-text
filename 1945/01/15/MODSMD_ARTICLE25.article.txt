the shower room high point man of
the night with 14 digits to his credit.
Art Burris, the Guard's powerful
! center, tanked 12 points to lead his
j team to victory, mostly on follow
shots and setup plays.
Guard Starts Fast
Armed Guard, dazzling with speed
and perfection, sizzled in the first
. half until the score began to look
| like a walkaway for the victors. In
fact, the Guard had its second team
playing in the waning minutes of the
: first half when Ed Douglas, flashy
! Independent guard, sank four points
| to make the halftime count read
;23-14.
However, Player - Coach Dave
j Brown called for long shots after the
| rest period, and the Independents
| closed the gap to 28-23 in the third
j quarter. Burris, and Bobby Anet
took the score up for the Guard be
fore Thompson and Douglas began
j swishing the netting again.
Brown Fouls Out
The Navy squad put together fast
| breaks and sensational long shots to
j pull 11 points ahead of the Palo Alto
j club before Thompson and Jack
| Heald found the hoop from pivot
I and follow shots.
With but three minutes to play,
j Brown was ejected on five fouls by
j the stern reffing duo. Thompson rang
the basket for two points as the buz
! zer sounded, the Guard winning,
j42-36.
The Independents, composed of
j Stanford players, showed sparks of
Rood basketball, but had trouble
I stopping the speedy Navy offense.
Yet the Palo Allans did mighty well,
for the Guard offense hasn't been
| stopped yet in NCBA play.
