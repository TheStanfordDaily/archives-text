# Bulge Flattened 40 Miles
## 
### 
PARIS, Monday, Jan. 15 (UP).—
Allied forces, collapsing the Ar
denne bulge to one-third its origi
nal size, trapped thousands of Ger
mans Monday and rolled back Carl
Gerd Von Rundstedt's surviving
panzers 40 miles from the high tide
of their winter drive, battered by
swarms of planes.
More than a score of towns fell as
Americans and British troops forged
ahead up to four and one-half miles.
The U.S. First Army cut the enemy
escape artery east of Houffalize and
moved within three and one-half
miles of a junction with the Third
Army at what had been the waist of
the salient, now the apex of the
shrinking German front.
British troops driving in from the
western end of the bulge and Third
Army forces attacked on an eight
mile front from the south to spring
two of the traps joining forces at
points roughly five and eight miles
west of Houffalize.
The third and largest pocket was
formed around Houffalize itself, the
German headquarters in the first
phase of the Ardennes campaign,
when tanks of the U.S. First Army's
third armored division smashed
three miles southward and cut the
St. Vith escape road.
Favored by the best weather of
the 12-day-old Allied counter-offen
sive, Allied pilots made 4.000 flights
against the Germans, ripping enemy
troops, tanks and transports pulling
northeastwards in packed targets,
and ranging deep into Germany to
blast enemy transportation and com
munications targets.
The westernmost pocket, centered
on the village of Cens, was expected
to yield only a handful of prisoners,
but the one just to the east had
caught sizable German forces in
cluding 25 tanks, which had been
counter-attacking the Third Army
around Bertogne, six miles south
west of Houffalize.
