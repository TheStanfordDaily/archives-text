# Trustees Name Architect To Plan for Expansion
## 
### 
An exhaustive survey of Stanford University facilities and possibilities
for their postwar expansion has been started on campus, under the super
vision of E. T. Spencer, San Francisco architect, who has been named
director of planning by the Trustees.
Duties of (he new director, according to Frank F. Walker, financial vice-

â™¦president, will be to determine "how
we are today" and secondly, "where
we want to go from here."
Will Take Inventory
Mr. Spencer will make a complete
inventory of the. Stanford physical
plant, including status of the lighting
and steam heat systems and the con
dition of the roads.
, Upon the basis of his findings, the
planning director will define a pro
gram for new facilities that will be
required to carry out the plans of
| Stanford for the postwar period, after
| they have been proved and adopted,
j Several possibilities for postwar
j building expansion will be reviewed,
I including a new Law School build
ing, additional residences and dining
rooms, and a completely modern
Student Union.
Site Plan To Be Made
In addition, a site plan is to be
developed for the campus as a whole,
] based upon circulation, buildings,
I and facilities now existing 01 project
ed for the future. The flow of auto
mobile traffic and relocation of park
ing areas will be taken into consid
eration in blueprints for new, prop
erly planned roads, parking spaces,
and for widening of the traffic lanes
currently in use. Larger traffic ar
teries are to be directed outside the
! immediate classroom area; the Quad
! and outlying academic region will be
| completely closed to automobiles.
Mr. Spencer will coordinate and
j work in consultation with an admin-
I istrative Advisory Planning Com
' mittes, consisting of Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder, Stanford president; Frank
F. Walker, financial vice-president,
| and Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, academic
j vice-president.
Action Started Before
i At a meeting in June, 1941. the
Board of Trustees first initiated a
plan calling for a complete study of
i the University's physical plant. It
i included the development* of future
I building projects on the campus.
: Steps taken in this direction were
I abruptly halted, however, after De
j ccmber 7, 1941.
The Board of Trustees in October
I of 1944 authorized $10,000 for the ad
i ministration to take appropriate steps
i toward reviving the study.
