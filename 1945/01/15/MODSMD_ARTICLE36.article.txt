j TOGETHER AGAIN now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
-Due to travel restrictions Charles
Boyer and Irene Dunne couldn't
make it to the Casbah but. neverthe
less, they both do what Hollywood
and the public expects of them in
"Together Again," a sprightly bit of
comedy that has its share of fun.

The story con
cerns the efforts of
Miss Dunne, may
or of a small Ver
mont town, io se
cure the services
of Sculptor Boyer
for a statue of her
dead husb a n d.
This takes Miss
Dunne to New
York, where,
a mone other

things, she is arrested as a strip
j teaser in a supper club raid.
Eventually Boyer follows Mayor
| Dunne back to Vermont and you all
I can guess what happens then.
Blessed with good casting and a
| delightful music score, "Together
I Again'' provides acceptable escapist
I entertainment.
Much of the humor is of the
tongue - in - cheek variety which
heightens the merriment at times.
Fluffy as it may be. "Together Again"
does garner many hearty laughs.
This reviewer didn't have the time
to sit through the second feature,
"One Body Too Many," which stars
Jean Parker and Bela Lugosi (maybe
! Jean has found the right leading man
a tlast). Anyway, the editors of this
paper have told me that I mustn't
say anything more bad about Miss
Parker because she might sue us or
something like that. All I'll say is
that as I left the theater, the Palo
Alto Fumigating Company was going
in.—Dick Bower.
