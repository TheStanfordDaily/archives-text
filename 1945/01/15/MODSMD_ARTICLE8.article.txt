# Cossacks Sing January 28
## 
### 
Dorothy Granville, manager of
California Concerts, announces the
appearance of the Original Don Cos
sacks on Sunday afternoon, January
28, at the San Francisco Opera
House.
The Don Cossack Chorus is cele
brating two anniversaries. This will
be the organ-voiced Russians' fif
teenth American tour. It will also be
the 25th anniversary of the founding
of this aggregation of musical giants
by the diminutive Serge Jaroff.
In 1920, a troop of bedraggled Rus
sian soldiers dreamed of homeâ€”a
thousand miles away in the Don
River Valley. Inevitably, being Rus
sians, they sang of home. Lieutenant
Jaroff realized then that others be
sides himself would enjoy the deep
throated choruses of his comrades.
Now, 25 years later, the Don Cos
sacks have traveled a million miles;
have entertained Americans in more
than 100 cities, beginning their sea
son before sold-out audiences at the
Metropolitan Opera House.
Tickets for the January 28th per
formance at the Opera House are ob
tainable at California Concerts' Box
Office: Sherman Clay's, telephone
GArfield 4061. In Oakland, Hlgate
8575.
