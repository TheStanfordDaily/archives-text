# Reporter Kept Busy Counting Quad Smokers
## Professors And Law Students Greatest Violators 
### 
Monday was a typical Stanford day, with typical offenders
blissfully smoking on Quad. They didn't know that this day
they were making statistics. For two Daily observers were
counting their violations.
The figures these two observers gathered speak for them
selves. In the two hours from 9 to 11 they watched a grand
total of 35 people smoking on Quad, including five professors.
And it was professors and law students who led.

From 9 to 10 a.m., there were 12 offenders,
including two professors, five law students
and five miscellaneous students. Violations
were even heavier from 10 to 11 a.m., with
13 smoking on Inner Quad alone. One of these
was a professor, and several were students
sitting in front of the Law School, obviously
guite at home. At the same time, ten people
were nonchalantly smoking on Outer Quad.
Most of them could easily have walked outside

Quad or could have gone to one of the nearby
rooms where it is permissible to smoke.

Nor can these typical 35 plead ignorance, for this tradition
has been widely publicized. Certainly the law student must
have heard of it many times. And it was a well known and
highly respected professor who hid his burning pipe under
one hand as he talked to a colleague on Quad. Certainly, it
seems to be our freshmen who have most carefully observed
Mrs. Stanford's famous reguest.
Perhaps some of the students do not realize that Outer
Quad is included in this tradition. They watch older students
smoke there and think it must be legal. But, in reality, only
the outer steps are excepted. The moment a Stanfordite comes
under the roof on Outer Quad his cigarette should be extin
guished.
Our traditions are enforced only by the "Stanford spirit."
Beginning with the Honor Code and including the reguests of
Mrs. Stanford, they have been faithfully kept through earth
guake and war.
As Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur said in referring to the tradition
of not smoking on Quad: "In a way it is not so significant as
are some other traditions, but is one of those things that, if
maintained, help to keep up the Family morale."
