# Broader Campus Experience Offered To Daily Tryoutees
## 
### 
There is an extra special anticipa-
I tion put into every morning when
you know that you did something the
day before which will be enjoyed or
at least endured by seven points of
} publicationâ€” r the readers of the Stan
lord Daily.
i You will find a new zip to the
j Cellar coffee, perhaps; a new enjoy
, rnent to your 8 o'clock, ah-ha, if you
j can se secure in the knowledge that
j Stanford students are appreciating,
discussing and thinking about the
I articles you and other reporters
spend time to procur.
i Part of Stanford
Stanford strives to give its students
something more than mere scholar
' ship; it strives to give them the
I means of beginning a full, interest
ing, well-balanced life. The best way
for both new and old students to
become an integral part of Stanford
j life is to interest themselves in the
activities and organizations which
j control the public opinion of the
University. Keep up the grades, yes;

but become a part of another type of
living also.
The literary organizations of the
campus offer this opportunity per
haps better than any other activity
on campus.
Chappie, Intellectual?
However, while the Chappie pro
vides a certain amount of intellectual
recreation, it only comes out once or
twice or three times a quarter, and
is, therefore, rather limited in its
scope.
To proceed even further, the Quad,
estimable as it is, only comes out
once or twice or ten times a decade.
Bargain Offer
Consequently, to get the most for
your money, you arrive at the Stan
ford Daily, where they allow you to
work the skin off your feet, the nails
off your fingers, the A's, B's, and C's
off your report card, not once or
twice but five t# les a week.
The tryouteee meeting will be held
at 5 p.m. today in the Daily shack
and the traditional black whip will
be served.
