# TRADITION
## 
### 
This morning Daily reporters took note of the
people that can be seen on Quad daily, flouting
a tradition which Stanford has fought hard,
though spasmodically, to maintain from its
founding.
It was obvious that most of the people who
were smoking on Quad did so wittingly —a
negligible few may not know of the tradition,
a few may not know how much it means. We
hope that the present evidence, that there are
some who are incapable of knowing what it
means, can be refuted.
The Stanford student body, especially in war
time, has lost many of the opportunities it used
to have to act, to think, and to do things to
gether. And everything we can think and feel
together is and will be an important thing to
all of us. The institution where we are spending
approximately four years of our life should be
more than a place where we can "get by" on
a minimum of courtesy and respectful behavior.
We owe a lot to a lot of people because we
are at Stanford today. We owe a lot because
we are free to shout about the things we don't
like and that we want to change. Let the vast
majority then protest the reckless few who find
no better match for their rugged individualism
to flout a tradition which enforcement would
defame.
We value our space too much to direct an
appeal to people who smoke on Quad, but we
ask most students, and grad students and pro
fessors who observe the tradition, to mention
its meaning to people who do not deserve to
wittingly bear the implications of degenerated
sensibilities which smoking on Quad, in the
final analysis, implies.
Let us enforce the observance of one of Stan
ford's most honored family traditions as a token
of mutual respect for each other, for all Stan
ford people who have observed it, and who will
observe it in respect to our wishes.
". . . . In a way it is not so significant as are
the other traditions, but it is one of those things
that, if maintained, help to keep up the Family
morale."—Dr. Wilbur.
