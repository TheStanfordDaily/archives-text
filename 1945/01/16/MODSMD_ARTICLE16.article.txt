Editor's Note—Because columnists inevitably are
accepted as reflecting the policies of a paper, we are
appending a note that (his column presents an argu
ment contrary to the sincerest convictions of the edi
tors of Volume 107; it is presented, however, in the
interests of sound journalism.
"There is no more fundamental characteristic of free
lomless governments than their compulsory service
laws . . .
"II peace time conscription is effected and-I am tin
fortunate enough to be killed in the war against mili
tarism yet to be finished. I can't help but feel I shall
have died in vain. Should I be fortunate enough to live,
I will fight it with all the power one small voice can
muster, inspired only by a sincere love of freedom."
This view of a Serviceman on peacetime conscription
was printed in Time last week; it contrasts strangely
with the Daily editorial ol last Friday on peacetime
•onscription.
Of those who have thought little about our responsi
bilities as a nation, and who know little of the necessity
for action in the international crisis, some oppose peace
'ime conscription; some support it.
Many of those who have just awakened to the very
•ritical nature of our present position and see that we
MUST assume some sort of active and effective respon
sibility in the world, support peacetime military con
•ici iption.
Then there are those who see not only the immediate

situation, but sec the surroundings and shadows, the
vastness and depth of the suffering and turmoil going
on in the world, the amount of fear and hate and hope
lessness in men's souls. Some, desperate and knowing
not which way to turn, place their last hope in the pos
sibility that militarism might mix with Democracy;
others believe that conscription and military force are
not merely unpleasant alternatives, but are desperately
and dangerously inadequate for our problems.
It has become all too apparent that our participation
in this war is an act of desperation by a people who
have nearly lost faith in the purposes and processes of
Democracy. We saw that the world in which we were
living was completely unstable and unsound, and as
it collapses in revolution, although many of us would
wish for something less horrible and less destructive,
we are only able to struggle for our own survival.
We were either not willing or not able to solve the
problems that caused this war; and it seems often that
we shall not be able to solve the problems that will lead
to the next war. As the time for peace draws near, the
whole system that breeds suspicion, distrust and dis
honesty between nations and races is being reinstated.
The return of a belief in military forcc—as outmoded
and inappropriate today as magic and witchcraft—on
the part of honest and sincere people is more than
tragic: it is disastrous. A reliance on military force, as
for instance a belief in the value of a postwar peacetime
draft, is unrealistic and ineffective.
It is unrealistic and ineffective because our problem
today is not one of power, but of perspective. There is
more force available today than there ever has been
before, but no one knows how to use it; no one has
the courage to trust others to use it. Russia, for exam
ple, at first seeking to become a government of the
people has become an inhuman, an opportunistic dic
tatorship. No one trusts Russia; Russia trusts no one.
But to criticize the policy of reliance upon military
force is only meaningful if we can suggest some other
way by which we can solve the problems of war, and
the problems that follow war. We must find answers to
these problems, and answers that are both practical and
possible. There is no hope of balancing power with
power; sooner or later we must abandon dependence
on power, and the sooner the better. We must balance
power with a feeling of responsibility and obligation.
We must make ourselves and others so acutely aware
of the bonds and ties between human and human that
we can never again forget our responsibilities.

on in the world, the amount of fear and hate and hope
lessness in men's souls. Some, desperate and knowing
not which way to turn, place their last hope in the pos
sibility that militarism might mix with Democracy;
others believe that conscription and military force are
not merely unpleasant alternatives, but are desperately
and dangerously inadequate for our problems.
It has become all too apparent that our participation
in this war is an act of desperation by a people who
have nearly lost faith in the purposes and processes of
Democracy. We saw that the world in which we were
living was completely unstable and unsound, and as
it collapses in revolution, although many of us would
wish for something less horrible and less destructive,
we are only able to struggle for our own survival.
We were either not willing or not able to solve the
problems that caused this war; and it seems often that
we shall not be able to solve the problems that will lead
to the next war. As the time for peace draws near, the
whole system that breeds suspicion, distrust and dis
honesty between nations and races is being reinstated.
The return of a belief in military forcc—as outmoded
and inappropriate today as magic and witchcraft—on
the part of honest and sincere people is more than
tragic: it is disastrous. A reliance on military force, as
for instance a belief in the value of a postwar peacetime
draft, is unrealistic and ineffective.
It is unrealistic and ineffective because our problem
today is not one of power, but of perspective. There is
more force available today than there ever has been
before, but no one knows how to use it; no one has
the courage to trust others to use it. Russia, for exam
ple, at first seeking to become a government of the
people has become an inhuman, an opportunistic dic
tatorship. No one trusts Russia; Russia trusts no one.
But to criticize the policy of reliance upon military
force is only meaningful if we can suggest some other
way by which we can solve the problems of war, and
the problems that follow war. We must find answers to
these problems, and answers that are both practical and
possible. There is no hope of balancing power with
power; sooner or later we must abandon dependence
on power, and the sooner the better. We must balance
power with a feeling of responsibility and obligation.
We must make ourselves and others so acutely aware
of the bonds and ties between human and human that
we can never again forget our responsibilities.
