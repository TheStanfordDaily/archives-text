### MARY AL SMITH 
El-how Incident
May this incident which occurred in the stacks of
the Law Libe renew in you the same joie de Stanford
that it has renewed in me.
It all began while I was reading the bound volumes
of the "Shaky versus Dick Tracy" case.
"Do you believe in fairies—boo fairies?" a voice
wheezed. And as this voice dressed in blue wheezed,
the air was filled with that rare yet ever-popular es
sence—Lucky Strike number seven.
"I didn't oughter ... er ... I shouldn't usedta . . ."
My retort showed that already 1 was falling under its
smoky spell.
At this dramatic moment it drawled, "L.S.M.F.T.
Leland Stanford Means Fine Traditions." And at the
same time an ameboid arm showed me an "age dated"
copy of the Frosh Bible.
Opening the Bible to a page entitled "Five Little
Traditions and How They Grew," the boo fairy read,
"It is written in the book that Stanford students shall .
not smftke on the Quad; they shall not ride their
kill-o-cycles down the steps of the History corner; •
they shall not . . ."
A thorough search of 10 seconds revealed that there
was just one affirmative tradition in a host of negative
ones.
"If you will put your hand on a stack of Frosh
Bibles and swear to never smoke on the Quad, I'll tell
you the tradition."
I did and it did.
And so this little incident renewed my joie de
Stanford. What—l'm forgetting something? If you
promise to give up fag flaunting on the Quad, I'll let
you in on the most pleasant of traditions.

Have you ever run out of ink—in the middle of a
quiz? in the middle of a lecture? in the middle of
a letter? in the middle of the night? You have? Well,
then, join the many students who fill their thirsty pens
at the fountain <tf Quink in the Civ Libe.
Even though you may have two consecutive classes
in the 8.A.C., dash over between them, fill your pen,
ch.tl with your friends, and dash back to class.
Even though you may be forging checks in a Paly
bank when your pen gives out. dash to the Libe, fill 'er I
up, chat with your friends who are playing bridge in
the Independent Room, and dash back. See how simple
it is?
In addition to being simple, it is a tradition, it is <
FREE, and it is B(s.r> proof.
See ya in the Civ Libe—but don't forget your
promise.
P.S.—To Daily leaders both paid and unpaid:
After a successful week of dodging tomatoes and old I
Acme bottles on Quad, I feel sure enough of my sprint
ing abilities to wiite under a by-line and take public
blame for having penned paxt and present of this quar- ,
ter s sessions.
