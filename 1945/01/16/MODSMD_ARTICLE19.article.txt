# Mural Casaba Starts Tonight
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
With all the speed of a housewife I
asking for a pound of butter, intra- .
mural basketball swings into its first
set of games tonight in Encina Gym ;
and the Pavilion. Head Mural King
Harry Wolter indicated late yester
day as he was completing plans for
ati efficient mural casaba league.
Eleven hoop teams have been en
tered in the league which will com
plete two complete rounds of games !
before the final winner is determined i
on a percentage basis. Med. School,
Chinese Club, and the Phi Psi's loom
as the pre-season favorites to do most j
of the winning.
Managers Report •
Managers of all teams are expected j
to report to Wolter's gym office im
mediately before their games in j
order to receive balls, whistles. |
score cards, and other equipment.
Wolter emphasized that games must j
begin on time, since 8:15 games can- ,
not be delayed for tardy openers, j
Games will consist of two 15-minute j
halves, with the new rule of five per- i
sonal fouls ejecting guilty players j
holding sway.
Keferees will be provided by the i
gym. Wolter said. There is still a I
drastic need for more refs, however,
at the $1 per hour rate.
