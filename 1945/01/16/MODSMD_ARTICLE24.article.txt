# Women's Housing Group Works With Dean Yost
## 
### 
A motion for a Committee of fif
teen to work with Dean Mary Yost's
office in solving the women's housing
problem for next year was carried at
the first meeting of Women's Con
ference at 3:15 p.m. yesterday in the
Women's Clubhouse.
The committee will be appointed
at Conference next Monday from
names suggested at house meetings
last night. Next year the sorority
houses will no longer have a select
group. Also, there will be an excep
tionally large Sophomore Class to
(ind housing for. The committee will
work with the Dean's office in work
ing out a system that will be agree
able to all Stanford women. It will
consist of a member from each house
and class.
Miss Yost Speaks
Miss Yost spoke to Conference
members about the duty of Stanford
students to the war effort and the
way in which they can arrange stud
ies and activities to allow time for
war work. "Students are beginning
to realize their individual insignifi
cance. but they are doing very little
about it." Miss Yost said. "They only
do war work when it is convenient
for them."
Miss Yost suggested that students
studj' hard and work on activities
during the week and use their week
ends for relaxation and for fun. If
less time were spent on bridge games
and movies during the week, stu
dents could accomplish studies, ac
tivities. and war work during the

I week and have time for their fun on
i week-ends.
Praises Sponsors
| She also complimented the spon-
I sors on their fine work this last
; quarter. Because of wartime condi
i tions, freshmen were not as well
prepared for college work as before,
and consequently there was a slump
I in their academic work.
"The sponsors did a fine job in pre
paring these freshmen for their col
lege work," Miss Yost said. "Aca
i demic work is the best thing for
trained minds and discipline for life
! after this war."
A committee of three will be
chosen at the next conference meet
ing to select books for the Allene
Thorpe bookshelf in Dean Yost's of
fice. This bookshelf contains books
| about women and by Women. Miss
Yost thought it would be helpful if
! girls who are interested in books
would help her select new books for
I the shelf.
