# All ‘Y’ -Function Set For Friday
## 
### 
Following the YWCA membership
drive last quarter, "Y" president
Marian Johnson signed and distribu
ted 1,055 tokens of membership to
Farm women—an all-time high at
Stanford and a higher percentage of
women than that attained by any
university in the country. Friday
evening at 7:15 each individual in
this record membership is invited to
attend the 'Y's' 1945 Open House in
the lounge of the Women's Club
house.
Part of the hour will be turned
over to Miss Carol Levene, Red Cross
staff worker who has recently re
turned from two years' service over
seas. Her experiences in Iceland—
converting barren huts into Red
Cross amusement centers, providing
a merry Christmas for men thou
sands of miles from home—and her
adventures in England before and
after the invasion, will provide a
narrative worthwhile and entertain
ing, according to executive secretary.
Miss Pat Davidson.
This is the first all-membership
meeting of the 'Y' in the '44-45 aca
demic year. All members are cor
dially invited to drop in for at least
part of the program.
