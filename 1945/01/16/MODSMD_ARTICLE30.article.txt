The Russians are finally starting
their offensive through Poland,
j There are so far two significant facts
to note about it. First, the main
i progress is being made on the south
i ern end of the front—the line from
j south of Warsaw to the Carpathians.
Second, this comes shortly after a
I repulse of a German relief column
! sent to break through to the garrison
in Budapest.
There was quite a bit of specula
! tion, lor awhile, as to where the en
i emy got enough forces to muster
such a column. The recent offensive
seems to answer it, however. The
i German high command robbed the
southern sector of the Polish front—
the nearest at hand to the Hungarian
theater—for its creation.
Criticism
This was a questionable move,
! since the enemy could best hold his
1 southern line in the narrow gap be
tween Italy, and the Bohinerwald
Mountains on the Czechoslovak fron
tier. Yet he made the gamble any
way, and in doing so he left a gap in
southern Poland.
The Red Army is attacking all
along the line of the Vistula, .hoping
to "iix" the rest of the German front,
or prevent the enemy from reinfprc
j ing a weak sector at the expense of a
. stronger one.
Thus the only thing the enemy can
do is to hope that his counteroffen
sive in Belgium has so hurt our plans
for a winter campaign that he can
drastically reduce his forces on the
1 western front in order to add to those
| on the east.
