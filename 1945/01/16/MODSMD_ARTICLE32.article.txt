Men students who are puzzled by

cused, and witnesses.
Assign Penalties
I The Council may expel a student
| from school, subject to the approval
| ot Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, or may
assign a student work hours in the
Convalescent Home. The trial goes
on the student's record and is a mark
against him if found guilty; however,
if found innocent, the record is not
held against him.
The Council is the judicial body
J for University men and receives
; complaints of violation of the honor
j code. If a complaint is received, a
i preliminary investigation is held and
if the charges are considered suffi
| ciently important they are presented
i before the Council for consideration.
I Charges are then preferred and the
student is summoned. He may have
witnesses or may present a written
J brief for his defense. If the student
i objects to a decision he may appeal
1 to Dr. Tresidder.
