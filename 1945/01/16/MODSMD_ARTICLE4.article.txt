### 
PARIS. Tues., Jan. 16 (U.R)â€”Amer
ican First Army tanks drove into
the stronghold of HoufTalize in the
heart of the Ardennes bulge Monday
and joined forces with the Third
Army near the town, while to the
east Lieut.-Gen. George Patton's
troops resumed their advance across
German soil, moving one and a half
miles through the Moselle valley.
Opening a new drive towards St.
Vith along the base of the bulge,
two veteran divisions of Lieut.-Gen.
Courtney Hodges' Army gained more
than one mile the first day, captured
pivotal Faymonville and struck
within six miles of St. Vith itself,
road bottlenecks for Marshal Karl
D. von Runstedt's retreating panzers.
A task force of the First Army's
Second Armored Division was the
first unit to enter HoufTalize, battling
within one-half mile of the town's
exact center in house-to-house
fighting.
