## ‘City’ Film For Tonight 
### 
Tonight (he Tuesday Evening Se
ries will present, for its second pro
gram of this quarter, two documen
tary films of wide interest. "The
River" and"The City" are considered
among the greatest films of this type
yet produced in America.
The film, "The River," traces the
I course of the mighty Mississippi and
j shows the great effect its ever
j changing mood has on the life of the
! people who live along its shores and
are dependent upon it for their liv
j ing. The picture tells the tragic tale
| of the periodical floods in the Missis
| sippi Valley, and how they leave
j their mark of erosion, poor farming
| conditions, and deforestation. Add
ing to the interest of the film is a
commentary by Pare Lorentz.
The second film, "The City,'' con
cerns the entirely different, but
equally absorbing, problems of city
planning and decentralization in our
modern cities. The commentary is
written, in a manner touched with
human detail, by Lewis Mumford,
professor of Humanities at Stanford,
who is now on a leave of absence. It
is delivered by Morris Carnovsky,
and is directed by Ralph Steiner.
Aaron Copeland's musical score
| might well be called an important
i addition to the art of the film.
The public is welcome, without
charge, to this program which begins
at 7:30 p.m. and is held in the Me
morial Auditorium.
