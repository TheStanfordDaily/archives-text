### 
Carole Carpenter, former North
Palo Alto Advertising Manager, was
named Business Manager of the
Daily at Publications Council meet
ing Monday, following the resigna
tion of Bill Conley a week ago due
to illness.
Her first official act was to call
for Business staff tryoutees. "The
first tryoutee meeting of the quarter
will be this Thursday at 5," said Miss
Carpenter. "All old or new students
interested in selling or office work
should be sure to see us then."
Miss Carpenter went on to say that
there are a number of paying posi
tions to which Biz Staff members
can work up and that work on the
Business staff is excellent experience
for those interested in advertising
work after they leave school.
The Business staff plans to hold a
series of three or four meetings to
train incoming members in office
procedure, advertising policy and
deadlines.
"We really aren't so bad when you
get to know us, honest," she went on.
"So head for the Shack and turn
to the right just inside that squeaky
door Thursday at 5 and we will be
plenty glad to see you," she con
cluded.
