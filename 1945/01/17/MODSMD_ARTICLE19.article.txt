# AND NO PLACE TO GO
## 
### 
At the beginning of the war, we promised our
selves that the best policy was to stick to down
to-earth, down-on-the-Farm social activities; we
attempted, at lease, to change our social code
and round it to fit the square hole of a world at
war. Then we discovered that although we
were willing to change over to on-campus ac
tivities we could get "all dressed up" any eve
ning of the week and still find no place to go;
even the Cellar was closed.
A committee of students who believed that
the Cellar, favorite spot of the 101 crowd, could
not only provide Stanford men and women with
chocolate shakes and white coffees, but was es
sential as a center for informal companionship,
inquired about the possibilities of keeping the
Cellar open during evening hours, and they
were given their answer, "It's up to Stanford
students."
To provide after-show and after-dance snacks,
the Cellar will need a regular crew of about
eight workers nightly, waiting on tables, wash
ing pots and cleaning, drying, and operating the
dish machine. To act as a much-needed place
where students of various class years can meet
and become acquainted, the Cellar must have a
crew of three or four to work from 7:30 to 8:15,
and of three or four to work from 9 to 11:30 at
night.
A method may be used by which crews of 16
work on alternate nights. Cellar officials ask, in
all fairness, that the hashers be reliable, experi
enced, and prompt.
One dozen students, by volunteering to do
paid work at the Cellar during these hours, can
make the largest contribution to on-campus so
cial life that the Farm can provide. If you want
to be among those students, inform your house
president; Barbara White, ASSU president, or
Mary Lou McClure, ASSU vice-president, as
soon as possible.â€” Nada Skidmore.
