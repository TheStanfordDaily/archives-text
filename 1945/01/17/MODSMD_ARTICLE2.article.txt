"The River" traced the life of the
Mississippi River and its adjacent
valleys, showing how indiscriminate
farming methods have reduced to
waste millions of acres of land, caus
ing floods, erosion, and poverty and
misery for the people of the Miss
issippi River Valley.
Although less widely advertised,
"The City" was accompanied by an
excellent musical background and

healthy atmosphere of country living
and planned communities with the
harum-scarum monotony of life in
the modern big city, bitterly and ef
fectively satirizing the so - called
"advantages" of modern machines,
factories, and improvements.—Shel
