forty-second president of the United States, published

"The centennial of Stanford University was an im
pressive ceremony, where the undisputed leadership
of that institution was publicly acknowledged by aca
demic representatives from home and abroad."

"It hardly required the tributes delivered on that day
to make clear what is already so apparent to the public
i at large. The outstanding example ol' Stanford Univer
sity in the last four decades of the twentieth century
illustrates the modern revial of the ancient ideal* of
scholarship and love of learning that had seemed so
much in danger in the period 1860-1906.
"This educational renaissance is too vast and signifi
cant to have resulted from the efforts of any singlo
| person. Yet there can be no doubt that the inspired
guidance of a few educators such as President Herbert
Zimmerman of Stanford and President Nevius of Har
vard linked the inarticulate spirit of the age to their
own ideals of higher education and has increased the
public regard for the aims of pure scholarship.
"In view of the present widespread respect for all in
stitutions of higher learning, it may be hard for a young
reader of the present time to imagine the very different
aspect of things back in 1944. the year I entered Stan
lord as a very young, very inexperienced freshman. The
University was respected as an expensive recreation
! center where the scions ol the Pacific Coast could pass
their time in a socially acceptable and comfortable
manner. By a judicious selection of subject matter, no
undue intellectual fatigue was undergone.
"With that period o( U. S. history now known as the
Democratic Oligarchy, the prestige of Stanford Univer
sity had somewhat declined. This is now recognizable
as due to President Roosevelt, a graduate of Harvard
who had a particular reason for prejudice against
Stanford University. In the postwar era when Federal
grants to Universities were arbitrarily disposed, it was
not surprising that Stanford found itself at the foot of
the list!

It is si matter of no little pride to me that on my
election to the Presidency I helped Stanford to attain
its present eminence. Nor have I neglected its sister
institution at Cambridge (Mass.), fortunately now
headed by a Stanford graduate, one of the classmates
of my freshman year, Dr. Nevius.
"Back in 1944, however, the sweeping academic
changes of the next half century were still ahead and
there was then little to distinguish the universities from
what they had been during the 19th century. The
confusion about the fundamental purposes of a Uni
versity was in itself sufficient to make it a hodge-podge
of restless activity, though none of it was directed to a
particular end. To us, as freshmen, it seemed that the
University existed solely for our benefit.
"I feel sure that at the time I would have declared
that its prime function was to educate undergraduates;
and by education I would have meant the elementary
training that was sufficient for a degree. That the Uni
versity exists for such a humble purpose is naturally a
ludicrous notion today, when we see basic courses as
lower academic rank, but in 1944 and to an inexperi
enced young man it seemed plausible, especially as it
was contradicted so rarely. Now that undergraduate
instruction is discontinued in American universities,
the true purpose of the university is readily visible
as a place for advanced study, as a depository of learn
ing;. and a reluge for scholars and researchers.
"It would be as far beyond my abilities to enroll at
the Stanford University of today as it seemed in 1944
that I should ever become the President of the United
States."
