"Things are really not so tough"
. . . Cicero in his Catalinarian Orations.
So far the Daily Californians, Berkeley chapter, have
managed to keep their ratio a secret. But,—and this is
no hull—their secret is out at last.
Bonga, campus favorite and Daily foreign corre
spondent, was sent on a special mession on a special
Berkeley Bound fog-cutter. Here are some of the start
ling, revealing—but right—facts and figures which he
has reported in his hourly thought waves back to the
little green shack.
"Dere Editer:
"As you know by Inglish wocabularies am not so
good as Mr. Beatty was two busy outstanding lyons and
tigres to taught me enny United Stakes.
"Civilian mens to civilian womens, the Drofnats
(backwards it spells Stanford) ratio is 1:1.9.
Civilian mens to civilian womens, the Cal ratio is
almost 1:3.
"All ways yers, BONGA."
This communique is the result of many days of tire
less and gasolineless work on the part of Bonga. It is
to him that we owe cur deepest thanks for proving that
"Life Can Be Beautiful" and that, as Cicero says,
"Things are not really so tough at Stanford."
Poor Cal.
