PARIS, Jan. 16.—Allied armies, striking perhaps the first
blows from the west in the long-awaited grand drive to crush
Germany in synchronization with the Russian surge from the
east, launched attacks today on both flanks of the far flung
western front.
In the Ardennes bulge, tanks of the U. S. first Army cap- i
tured Houffalize and joined the Third Army there to form a
strong front that promised speedy elimination of the remaining
stump of the salient which two weeks ago imperiled Liege.
In the north, Field Marshal Sir Bernard L. Montgomery's
tanks and infantry went over to the attack at the Dutch fron
tier only 25 miles from the Rhineland industrial Munchen- |
Gladbach, seeking to reduce the long-standing German salient
reaching into Holland between Geilenkirchen and Roermond.
In the south, Lieut,-Gen. Alexander M. Pit's U. S. Seventh
Army in Alsace struck to wipe out the German's Rhine bridge
head above Strasbourg and immediately cut it by two miles.
