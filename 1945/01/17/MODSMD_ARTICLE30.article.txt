### DICK JENNINGS 
The 1945 intermural casaba season opened with a bang last night as ten
eager quintets went through their paces on the shiny hardwood of the
Men's Gym. Coming out of the first round tussles victorious were the Chi
nese Club, Tyler, Med. 11, and Phi Psi.
The snappy Tyler Hall group, paced by dead-eyed Turn Egan, squeezed

through to a 32-30 triumph over the
Legal Eagles in the most thrilling
battle of the evening. Tyler led at
the half 20-16 due to the accuracy ol
Egan, MacDowell, and Slobe—these
three accounted for 30 of the 32 Tyler
digits—but the Eagles almost copped
the duke in the second period from
their tiring opponents. Hartman tal
lied 12 markers for the Eagles.
Arguello A. A. failed to convert
their championship football squad
into a workable basketball aggrega
tion, for the Cardinals were nosed
out by the Med. ll's, 27-23, and the
Whites made a pitiful showing
against the Chinese Club, 27-7. The
Medicos set up an unconquerable
lead in the first few minutes of play
as Larry Corley sank five baskets in
rapid succession. The half-time score
was IG-10, and it stayed in that ratio
until the final whistle.
The Chinese Club unleashed an
unexpectedly overwhelming on
slaught on the faltering Arguello
Whites, the C. C.'s smooth-working
team play making possible a mad
scoring rampage by Wu, who copped
high-scoring honors for the night
with his total of 10 points. The high
riding Phi Psi's tamed the Buchanan
Bearcat in a rough tussle that saw
the Ashley, Hood, Pitts combo be
wildering the Buchanan boys.
