David E. Faville, professor of mar- '
keting of the Graduate School of |
Business, will outline the results of a
research project in products and
markets of the 11 western states in
a talk tomorrow afternoon, at 4:15, |
for the American Studies Sympo- j
sium.
First in the series of lectures ar- |
ranged by the School of Humanities j
to promote better understanding of j
American civilization, Professor Fa- j
ville's talk will report on recent phe- ,
nomenal industrial and business de- 5
velopments in the West and will also \
discuss the markets, both domestic j
and foreign, that will be available j
when those dependent upon the war !
are removed.
The steel, aluminum, plastic, and
wine industries, to name a few, now
have major centers in the western
states and the sports apparel indus- '
try, of which California is the cen-
ter, and the tourist trade are expect
ed to increase tremendously.
Professor Faville will discuss the j
problem of reconversion for the West !
and the filling of new needs created
by Army life. He has spoken on the j
results of the research in many Cali- I
fornia cities since the studies were j
completed in November, 1944, and i
was chairman of the committee. The j
talk will be given in the lower lounge 1
of the Women's Clubhouse.
