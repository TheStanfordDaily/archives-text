# RESPONSIBILITIESâ€”FOR YOU

### 
It's just one of those things, no doubt, that
once people complained that the size of the
Stanford student body was expanding too
greatly and we were no longer the boasted
Stanford Family. Then, as with all other things,
came the war, and a decrease in size to what
might once have been considered an ideal
student body where every one could obtain
his share of BMOCing, and have a voice and
an interest in campus events that were nestled
in their alley.
If that had been the way things happened,
of course, there would be no necessity for this
edit. The necessity is here, however, and last
night Excom announced that efforts need to be
made to bring a majority of Stanford students
into the activities of the student body.
Practically every organization on campus is
running short-handed and the discouraging
thing is that it is mostly in positions that do
not reguire any particular talent or even a great
deal of time. Stanford today has too many
people who are unwilling to step forth and
assume even small responsibilities for student
activities.
It seems that we are too v/ell trained in the
academic pursuits of criticizing, analyzing, and
grousing to get out and risk a few of the jibes
and keep campus organizations active.
Excom is now going to publish in the Daily
information about current positions in planned
activities that need filling. Students should not
hesitate to phone the people mentioned about
the job or the activity. House presidents and
sponsors ought to make use of these announce
ments to get people interested in activities that
they would like.
There are a great many of us who could find
the value of our college life doubled and tripled
and made an inspiring and thought-provoking
experience if we decided to make our college
life prove or show something while we were
here.
The books and lectures are mere skeletons if
our convictions about them are not tempered
with enforced experience. The faculty tea and
house meeting are false indications of what
people and things are.
Let's find the way things tick now, or be
prepared to take half measures the rest of our
lives.
