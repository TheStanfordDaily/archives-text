LOVE TO HAVE YOU
About 2 in the afternoon the place is a mess,
we'll admit. Just to get from the door to Carp's
exclusive inner office is something like getting
to the counter in Macy's bargain basement.
There are people making up the dummy and
people arguing over tomorrow's advertising and
people taking subscriptions and people just
reading magazines in the corner (we never have
figured out where these boys come from).
And all because the edit staff insists it must
have a dummy by 3. And a dummy for a big
paper, too, they say. Oh, sure, simplest thing
in the world, that dummy for a big paper, they
think. All they have to do is dummy it, don't
they?
We'd hate to call 'em narrow-minded, that
edit staff, especially right here in their own
edit column, but the fact remains that they
simply don't know what goes on, that's all. The
complex matter of making up ads and then,
then, persuading people to pay for them is just
a little too much for them.
However, if you'd like to be let in on a few
of these deep and well-guarded secrets as to
how the Daily manages to come out every day
(because it's the biz staff that does it in the end
and noJ the edit staff really, though I say here
where I shouldn't ought), come see us today
at 5 and, well, we're sure you'll enjoy being
among those pushing their way in and out
comes that 2 o'clock deadline time.
And if we can interest you in nothing else,
why not join the ranks of magazine readers in
the corner? Love to have you. —Nancy Tilden
