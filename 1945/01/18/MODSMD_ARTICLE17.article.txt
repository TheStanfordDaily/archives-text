Red Cross Benefit
The work the Red Cross is doing on the battle fronts
of the world is so great that it. has received the com
mendation of all nations. Through thick and thin, in
every national and local emergency their banners are
conspicuous and helpful. To try to build up the Red
Cross would be futile, for their record speaks for itself.
Now the real issue before us is the Red Cross drive
which will take place some time in the month of
February. Many ideas for the impetus to set the drive
in motion have been suggested and I have one that I
think will sort of help.
I think that having a basketball game between the
Palo Alto Independents and some strong service team,
such as the Armed Guard, Fleet Citv or St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, would draw a tremendous crowd, especially if
the game were played as a Red Cross benefit.
No first-class athletic competition has been held on
the campus since Stanford officially abandoned ath
letics, and an event of this caliber would draw many
supporters.
The game could be held in the newly resurfaced
pavilion, thus nullifying the cost of a playing court,
and only minor expenses wuold be entailed in the
matter ol tickets and handling of the event, thus mak
ing it possible to turn over the bulk of the proceeds
to the Red Cross.
The entire affair could be handled through the War
Board as a regular part of the drive, and I feel that
the Stanford student body would be there en masse to
help make the entire affair a success.* The game could
be followed by an after-the-game dance, with a nomi
nal charge for the dance to add greater support to the
proceeds from the dance.
"You're Welcome, Girls"
An open invitation to members of the student
body to watch the semi-weekly intramural basketball
games has been extended by the players and the offi
cials of the league.
Games are played on Tuesdays and Thursdays and
everyone from one end of the campus to the other is
invited to attend. The games are played in the pa
vilion and the men's gym, starting al 7:15 and finishing
at 9:15.
The former hesitancy of the feminine members of
the student body to attend the athletic events which
remained should rapidly disappear as more and more
attend.
If you feel that you should not ,<Â«r> alone, gather up
a group of your friends and tn i iwn toward the gym,
for an evening of fast and well-played basketball.
