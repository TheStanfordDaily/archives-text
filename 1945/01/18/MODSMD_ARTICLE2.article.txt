# Bicycles Ruled Off Palo Alto Sidewalks
## 
### 
Bike pedalers must stay off side
walks or Palo Alto police will find
a place for the stray bicycles in
Llieir collection.
The new law outlawing bicycles
oiÂ» Palo Alto sidewalks was passed
by the City Council and enforced
for the first .time last Friday. A
former law mentioned only "vehi
cles," not bicycles specifically.
Bicycles are kept two days the first
time, a week the second time, and
a third offense means no bicycle
for a month.
