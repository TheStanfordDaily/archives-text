'"The chief purpose of the Stanford
Alumni Association is to keep all
alumni iti contact with the Univer
sity," Alumni director Neal Van
Sooy, '28, remarked.
The association is independent of
the University and operates on mem
bership dues. Of the 42,000 total
Stanford alumni, 8,000 are members
of the Alumni Association. The asso
ciation sends the official alumni pub
lication "Stanford Alumni Review,"
to all members and to former Stan
fordites now in the service.
13th Conference
The association has planned and is

now preparing for the 13th Annual
Alumni Conference to be held Feb
ruary 17th in San Francisco and Feb
ruary 25th in Los Angeles. The as
sociation has branches in 50 Stanford
clubs throughout the country which
hold meetings regularly of Stanford
alumni. These clubs aid the Uni
versity by raising scholarships and
by encouraging schooling here.
The association was organized in
1892, the date of the first graduating
class. Mr. Van Sooy, '28, former
newspaper publisher, began as direc
tor in October of 1943. He also pub
lishes the Alumni magazine and re
plies to numerous letters from alum
ni every day.
Address Wanted
Many letters are received daily

asking for a colleague's address or a
list of Stanford alumni in a town
where the writer has just moved.
One letter requested a list of Stan
ford alumni now in the WAVES liv
ing in the Bay area, so the writer
could give a party. A typical service
man's letter would be this V-mail
letter: "I received your New Year
greetings and they were sure appre
ciated. It is gratifying to learn that
although one is almost lost (as I am
in this hole) his Alma Mater remem
bers him. I want to wish you a happy
1945 in return and I hope that I can
come back to Stanford before this
year is over. My main postwar am
bition still is to finish my last two
years for my degree."—A former
