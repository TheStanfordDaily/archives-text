While reading about the continu
ous success of Howie Dallmar, we
decided to reminisce a little. We
thought of the glorious days in Stan
ford's history when our school led
all others in sports and when our
school not only had the best basket
ball team on the Pacific Coast, but
also the best basketball team in the
nation. These were our thoughts,
and it is not surprising that we im
mediately turned to some old Dailies
and looked up some information on
that 1942 basketball team. We felt
that it would be a good idea if we
went back and took stock.
Everett Dean was the coach in
1942, and in the beginning of the
season expected a fairly good squad.
There were only two returning vet
erans, Don Burness and Bill Cow
den, but the sophomore prospects
were great. Burness and Cowden
weer elected co-captains. Both of
them were stars of the previous
years. They towered well over six
feet and were rugged.
The other members of the team
were sophomores Ed Voss, Jim Pol
lard, and Howie Dallmar. All of
these boys measured over six feet
four, and all were great prep stars.
.Pollard, who is rated as the only
player ever to come near Luisetti,
played on a Golden State five that
won a championship back East. At
the time he was playing, Pollard
was still in high school. One of the
oddities, if you can call it an oddity,
was that Dallmar also came from
the same high school—Lowell High
in San Francisco—that Burness and
Cowden came from.
In their first conference encoun
ter, the Indians slaughtered Cal 51-
35, with Pollard and Voss doing most
of the scoring. By that game, they
moved right into the lead of the
P.C.C.; they never lost that lead.
From then on, they were the team
to beat, or so thought all the other
colleges. But thinking of that did
not do anyone any good, for, except
lor one loss to U.S.C., the Indians
went through the season undefeated.
For the first time in years, they
swept the entire Cal series, winning
four straight games from the Bears.
After they had .sewed up the south
ern division of the P.C.C., they met
Oregon State for the championship
of the Coast. The poor Oregon State
five was spanked, and spanked hard,
and the Indians prepared for the
N.C.A.A. tourney in Kansas City.
When they hit Kansas City, the
Indian five were given very little
chance of getting into the semi
finals, but they surprised everyone,
except perhaps Everett Dean. They
dumped Rice, 52-47, and then
slaughtered Colorado, 4(>-35. Then
the big day came. The game with
Dartmouth would decide the na
tional champion. In a short time
that was decided, for Dartmouth was
never in the game; Stanford won,
53-38.
For his outstanding play through
out the season, Don Burness was
unanimously chosen on the All-
American five.
And as far as most people were
concerned, every member of that
1942 championship five was an All -
American.

of the Coast. The poor Oregon State
five was spanked, and spanked hard,
and the Indians prepared for the
N.C.A.A. tourney in Kansas City.
When they hit Kansas City, the
Indian five were given very little
chance of getting into the semi
finals, but they surprised everyone,
except perhaps Everett Dean. They
dumped Rice, 52-47, and then
slaughtered Colorado, 4(>-35. Then
the big day came. The game with
Dartmouth would decide the na
tional champion. In a short time
that was decided, for Dartmouth was
never in the game; Stanford won,
53-38.
For his outstanding play through
out the season, Don Burness was
unanimously chosen on the All-
American five.
And as far as most people were
concerned, every member of that
1942 championship five was an All -
American.
While reading about the continu
ous success of Howie Dallmar, we
decided to reminisce a little. We
thought of the glorious days in Stan
ford's history when our school led
all others in sports and when our
school not only had the best basket
ball team on the Pacific Coast, but
also the best basketball team in the
nation. These were our thoughts,
and it is not surprising that we im
mediately turned to some old Dailies
and looked up some information on
that 1942 basketball team. We felt
that it would be a good idea if we
went back and took stock.
Everett Dean was the coach in
1942, and in the beginning of the
season expected a fairly good squad.
There were only two returning vet
erans, Don Burness and Bill Cow
den, but the sophomore prospects
were great. Burness and Cowden
weer elected co-captains. Both of
them were stars of the previous
years. They towered well over six
feet and were rugged.
The other members of the team
were sophomores Ed Voss, Jim Pol
lard, and Howie Dallmar. All of
these boys measured over six feet
four, and all were great prep stars.
.Pollard, who is rated as the only
player ever to come near Luisetti,
played on a Golden State five that
won a championship back East. At
the time he was playing, Pollard
was still in high school. One of the
oddities, if you can call it an oddity,
was that Dallmar also came from
the same high school—Lowell High
in San Francisco—that Burness and
Cowden came from.
In their first conference encoun
ter, the Indians slaughtered Cal 51-
35, with Pollard and Voss doing most
of the scoring. By that game, they
moved right into the lead of the
P.C.C.; they never lost that lead.
From then on, they were the team
to beat, or so thought all the other
colleges. But thinking of that did
not do anyone any good, for, except
lor one loss to U.S.C., the Indians
went through the season undefeated.
For the first time in years, they
swept the entire Cal series, winning
four straight games from the Bears.
After they had .sewed up the south
ern division of the P.C.C., they met
Oregon State for the championship
of the Coast. The poor Oregon State
five was spanked, and spanked hard,
