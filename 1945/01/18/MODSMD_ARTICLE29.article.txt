## Independents Schedule Two Games Here Sat. 
### BILL ADAMS 
Playing their first games in "some" territory since the start of winter
quarter, the Palo Alto Independents basketball squad swings into high
gear over the week-end with three nearby games scheduled. On Friday
night the Stanford boys engage the reincarnated Santa Clara Broncos,
whom they previously defeated, 39 to 33, on the Santa Clara hardwood.

On Saturday night a double-header' 1
is scheduled for the Palo Alto High
School gym; the first game between
the Independents' reserves and Men
lo J.C. at 7:00 or 7:30 o'clock, and the
feature affair between the Independ
ents and Auten's to follow the first
fray. The Farm boys previously de
feated Auten's, an independent Palo
Alto team, 48 to 42.
Reserves Start
No information is available at
present concerning starting time or
price of admission to the Santa Clara
game. Coaches Dave Brown and
Jack Heald will probably start the
Independents' reserves against the
Broncos, according to Bob Rosburg,
Independents' spokesman.
Rosburg stated that the price of
admission to the two Saturday night
encounters will probably be 50 cents.
The "second string" will play the
entire preliminary game. Nothing
seems to be known of the collective
| merits or weaknesses of its oppo
nent, Menlo Junior College.
Auten's Good
The feature encounter with Au
| ten's should prove to be a thriller,
I according to information received
i from Rosburg. The Palo Alto team
I was undefeated previous to its last
I game with the Independents, and is
| still rated mighty good. It has since
| been strengthened by the addition
j of several top-flight cage men, in
| eluding forwards Norm Keeler, a
! former Paly High star, and Ted
Halmes, of Santa Clara; and guard
\ Mark Moyer.
| Starling Lineup
j The starting lineup for the Inde
i pendents in the Auten's game will
probably be: Motley Thompson and
I George Bower, forwards; Jack
| Heald, center; and Tom Brown and
jEd Douglas, guards. Luke Pitts,
j guard; Tom Ashley, guard; and per
: haps one or two other reserves will
' probably also see action in the sec
.ond game.
As this will be the first opportu
nity most Stanford men and women
have had to see their fellow students
play, a large crowd may be expected.
The Independents are also trying to
arrange other games to be played in
Palo Alto throughout the season. An
exhibition game with Borlo A.C. of
San Francisco has been planned for
sometime next month.

nite details as to time of games and

j The starting lineup for the Inde
i pendents in the Auten's game will
probably be: Motley Thompson and
I George Bower, forwards; Jack

jEd Douglas, guards. Luke Pitts,
j guard; Tom Ashley, guard; and per
: haps one or two other reserves will
' probably also see action in the sec

As this will be the first opportu
nity most Stanford men and women
have had to see their fellow students
play, a large crowd may be expected.
The Independents are also trying to
arrange other games to be played in
Palo Alto throughout the season. An
exhibition game with Borlo A.C. of
San Francisco has been planned for
sometime next month.
See the Daily tomorrow for defi

Playing their first games in "some" territory since the start of winter
quarter, the Palo Alto Independents basketball squad swings into high
gear over the week-end with three nearby games scheduled. On Friday
night the Stanford boys engage the reincarnated Santa Clara Broncos,
whom they previously defeated, 39 to 33, on the Santa Clara hardwood.

On Saturday night a double-header' 1
is scheduled for the Palo Alto High
School gym; the first game between
the Independents' reserves and Men
lo J.C. at 7:00 or 7:30 o'clock, and the
feature affair between the Independ
ents and Auten's to follow the first
fray. The Farm boys previously de
feated Auten's, an independent Palo
Alto team, 48 to 42.
Reserves Start
No information is available at
present concerning starting time or
price of admission to the Santa Clara
game. Coaches Dave Brown and
Jack Heald will probably start the
Independents' reserves against the
Broncos, according to Bob Rosburg,
Independents' spokesman.
Rosburg stated that the price of
admission to the two Saturday night
encounters will probably be 50 cents.
The "second string" will play the
entire preliminary game. Nothing
seems to be known of the collective
| merits or weaknesses of its oppo
nent, Menlo Junior College.
Auten's Good
The feature encounter with Au
| ten's should prove to be a thriller,
I according to information received
i from Rosburg. The Palo Alto team
I was undefeated previous to its last
I game with the Independents, and is
| still rated mighty good. It has since
| been strengthened by the addition
j of several top-flight cage men, in
| eluding forwards Norm Keeler, a
! former Paly High star, and Ted
Halmes, of Santa Clara; and guard
\ Mark Moyer.
