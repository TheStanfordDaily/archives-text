# Howie Dallmar Leading Scorer
## 
### 
Howard Dallmar, ex-Stanford star
basketball player and guard in the
1942 Cardinal national championship
team, is currently the leading scorer
of the University of Pennsylvania,
which is tied for first place in the
Eastern Inter-collegiate League race.
In six games, Dallmar swished
through 51 points, on 21 field goals
and nine foul tips. But his scoring is
only part of the valuable work that
he does for his team, for he is still
controlling the backboards, as he
did at Stanford and later on at St.
Mary's Pre-Flight. Also, his han
dling-out of assists marks him as
one of the best players in the East
this season.
V-7 Student
Dallmar is a V-7 naval student
taking refresher courses before en
tering midshipmen's school. In a
recent game, he not only scored 17
points but played a brilliant floor
game as well.
Dallmar is no novice at the game,
having been a star ever since his
junior high days. While he played
in San Francisco, Dalmar was rated
as one of the greatest centers in the
history of the league. While only
a sophomore at Stanford, Dallmar
was a regular member of the great
1942 team, where he took over the
guard berth. Usually, the guard Is
a very low-scoring player, but Dall
mar was the exception. In a crucial
U.S.C. game in which the Pacific
Coast championship was at stake,
Dallmar scored 18 points.
Most Valuable Player
Probably the greatest honor in his
career was after the final game of
the N.C.A.A. championship, when
Stanford had beaten Dartmouth 55-
20. For on that day, Dallmar was
voted as the most valuable player of
the game.
Further Glory
While playing with Hank Luisetti
for St. Mary's Pie-Flight, Dallmar
kept up his terrific record. During
the season he was one of the high
est-scoring guards on the Coast, and
also one of the best players in the
nation.
