# Howie Dallmar Leading Scorer
## 
### 
Howard Dallmar, ex-Stanford star
basketball player and guard in the
1942 Cardinal national championship
team, is currently the leading scorer
of the University of Pennsylvania,
which is tied for first place in the
Eastern Inter-collegiate League race.
In six games, Dallmar swished
through 51 points, on 21 field goals
and nine foul tips. But his scoring is
only part of the valuable work that
he does for his team, for he is still
controlling the backboards, as he
did at Stanford and later on at St.
Mary's Pre-Flight. Also, his han
dling-out of assists marks him as
one of the best players in the East
this season.
V-7 Student
Dallmar is a V-7 naval student
taking refresher courses before en
tering midshipmen's school. In a
recent game, he not only scored 17
points but played a brilliant floor
game as well.
