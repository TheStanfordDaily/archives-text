# Mural Hoopsters Resume League Battles Tonight
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Off its convincing showing against
Buchanan's Bearcats Tuesday night,
the Phi Psi mural basketball squad
is a top-heavy favorite to hang up
its second win in as many starts
against the Argucllo A.A. Cardinals
in tonight's resumption of league
play in Encina Gym and the Pa
vilion.
Sparked by Luke Pitts, Tom Ash
ley, and Tom Hood, the Phi Psi's
look to be the team to beat by virtue
of the combined experience and
speed of which the entire team can
boast. The Arguello bunch, still far
from organized, point to Woody
Hansen, Don Rouillard, Horace
Chandler, and Don Murphy as their
nucleus.
Betas vs. Tyler
The Beta quintet, featuring the
point-getting eye of Morley Thomp
son, comes up against Tyler Hall in
what proves to be a tight contest.
Tyler, led by Tommy Egan and Alan
MacDowell, are expected to finish
close to the top, and have a good
chance of winning tonight. The
Betas, untested in league play, are
an unknown threat with Joe (Our
Hasher) Sher, Ric Supple, and Doug
Tuck teaming up with Thompson.
Med. School, paced by sharp
shooting Larry Corley and victors
over Arguello, face the Legal Eagles,
a squad that showed fairly well in
its debut against Tyler. These two
teams are potentially strong, and a
flip of the coin would be useless to
pick the favorite.
Gerona to Play
The traditionally strong Gerona
A.C. club comes up against Ar
guello's Whites, who showed piti
fully against the Chinese Club in the
opener. Gerona, victors by a de
fault over Sequoia, aren't expected

to face too much opposition against
the Arguello "B"' outfit.
Buchanan Hall meets Sequoia's
Roughs and Chinese Club draws a
bye, according to the mural sched
ule posted by Mural Head Harry
Wolter.
