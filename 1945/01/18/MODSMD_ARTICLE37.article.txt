## 
### 
"Toyon men, who are on campus
for their first year, are attempting
to show the campus what a good
formal is really like," says Toyon
Club prexy Bob Stephens in regard
to Toyon's February 3 formal —
"Sweetheart Time."
"All of Toyon is helping with some
phase of the dance to help make it
the best school formal of the year
(Sophomores take note!)," Stephens
went on to say.
Arrangements are now being made
for either a San Francisco orchestra
or a Bay Area service band to play
for the dance.
Decorations emphasizing the love
love-love theme will be predominant
at the dance and are being made now
by Jack Gilliland and his committee
consisting of Bob Kincaid, Bill Pil
cher, Tom Slater, Jerry Goss,
"Judge" Lewis, Jerry Matin, and
Modesto Giordano.
Ironing out details for ticket sales

Berry and Tom Winters. Arranging
publicity for the dance are Bob Peck
and an art committee consisting of
Eddie Lundquist, Gil Wheat, and
Coyt Hackett.
