# Biz "Board," Calls Tryoutees
## 
### CATHERINE OWEN 
Once upon a time in a shack on
the Stanford campus lived an office
named "Biz." Biz himself was noth
ing but a stack of boards, so he hired
a manager to give him life.
Now Biz's manager was given a
private plot of land within Biz. In
this plot the manager made schemes
for bringing in more people, for cre
ating more activity, for making Biz
more and more happy. So Biz's man
ager papered the walls of his plot
with L'il InJun cartoons, invited peo
ple in to look at the cartoons, locked
the door, and thus the department
heads were created.
Make M ore Happy
This still didn't create enough ac
tivity for Biz, so the department
heads set out to bring in more peo
ple, for creating more activity, for
making Biz more and more happy.
Biz no longer was board. His in
nards were in a happy state of con
fusion. He was happy. Biz's mana
ger created a slight stir with his
chucklings at the adventures of L'il
InJun. The department heads cre
ated a definite breeze with the lash
ing of their whips; and the third
group of more people caused a deep
rumble in Biz as they caught their
fingers in the addressing machine,
built bonfires with ad blanks, and
threw glue bottles at each other.
Yes, Biz was happy.
But that was once upon a time.
Biz is 'Board.' Biz's innards are no
longer in a state of confusion. Biz's
manager still chuckles at Lil InJun,

the department heads still lash their
whips, but no longer is the third
group of more people around to carry
on their activities. Biz is no longer I
happy. Biz is once more board.
In fact, Biz has reached such a
crucial state of happiness that his
very life is in danger. Surely you're
willing to cheer Biz by forming the

third class of more people. If you
can't build bonfires, throw glue bot
tles, or catch your fingers in ma-
I chines, Biz'sÂ» manager will drape a
I blanket around you, stick a feather
j in your hair, and set you in the cor
ner for atmosphere.
Biz staff tryouts are to be held to
day at 5 in Biz's office.
