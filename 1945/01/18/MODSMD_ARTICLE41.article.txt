The European war is going into its !
most critical stage—much more criti- j
cal. perhaps, than that during the j
days of the suspense-filled news of j
von Rundstedt's counteroffensive. j
The German general staff might at
last be meeting the problem of simul- j
taneous attack on all sides, some
thing which it has never really faced
in this war.
The first thing that lias happened
is the Russian offensive. The rela
tion of it and the abortive effort of
the Germans to break back into
Budapest has been discussed in the
iast column of this series. Yet the
tactical form of this great battle is
beginning to focus and thus it can be
discussed in greater detail.
The southern end of the Vistula is
in the shape of an arc, the concave
face toward Germany. The Russians !
have two bridgeheads at the end !
points, one just south of Warsaw,
and the other near the Carpathians ■
and almost to the gates of Krakow.
The first blow was struck from the
latter. Instead of mounting an of
fensive due west, as was done be
fore, the commander of the Russian
army group here moved to the
northwest, threatening to knife be
hind the Germans in (lie curve of
ihe arc.
The enemy then seems to have
sent reserves from the Warsaw sec- :
tor in a useless effort to block the .
progress. Then the Red armies in
the northern bridgehead started an
offensive toward those moving up
from the south. The drives form a I
pair of pincers that might lever the
German right wing onto the Polish [
plains where it can be destroyed.
If the German don't try to hold j
with their right in the open, they j
will be forced to fall back all the !
way to the Oder, bringing the Rus- ,
sians to within a few miles of Berlin.
Tli is leaves the enemy with a couple
of very unpleasant alternatives.
Their only hope is to shift troops
from the west.
However, an attack by the Allied
armies there might maul this hope, I
but at least will worry them for a 1
time. The British Second Army is
moving against a bulge in its lines
north of Aachen, and we don't know ■
yet whether this is a major drive or |
a minor operation. However, it is I
pinning down German reserves on
the western front.
We know that von Rundstedt's of- I
fensive had a great disruptive effect

on our plans. However, there are
four other significant facts:
1. The northern plain that is be
yond the British lines is undefen
siblc and leads straight to Berlin. An
Allied break-through here would be
disastrous.
2. The Germans have been con
ducting many minor attacks in this
sector lately. It could just possibly
be that they were designed to give a
false impression of strength, German
reserves having been shifted from
here to other sectors.
15. As (he German Belgian bulge
retracted, our lines shortened and
troops were released for battle in
new locations.
4. After von Rundstedt had cut
the lateral communications at the
high water mark of his Belgian of
fensive between our northern and
southern wings, he shifted troops to
try an ill-fated attack on General
Patch's over - extended 7th Army.
Patch stopped it by quickly concen
trating between Strassbourg and his
junction point with the Third Army.
The German armor clown here is now
100 far away from the northern sec
tor of the enemy lines to reinforce
them.
Von Rundstedt, then, has cause for
worry.
