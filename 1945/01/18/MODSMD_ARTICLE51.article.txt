# Stanford Shoe Shop Limited to Repairs
## 
### 
"We don't do any more shining or
dyeieg — just repairing shoes," said
Albert and Maurice Delyon, owners
ol the Stanford shoe shop since 1912.
There is such a rush for shoe re
pairing that the Delyon's uncle and
nephew, are always behind in their
work. Everyone who comes into the
shop wants to be waited on first and
have his shoes ready first.
Shoes Poorly Made
"The shoes nowadays give you
more work because they aren't built
light. Many of the soles are made
out of fabric and the new soles have
to be cemented on instead of nailed
on as before," commented Albert
Delyon. "Also, we have three pairs
of women's shoes to one pair of
men's, and the women's shoes take
much more time and are much hard
er to work on.'" So far the two men
have been able to get the best leather
there is to work with.
A native of Martinique, Albeit
Delyon is now a United States citi
zen. Repairing shoes has always
been his business and out of 35 years
of work, he has only missed two
days. His first shoe shop at Stan
ford was on the site of the present
Union. Since that time he has moved
hi.s shop five times, and the shop is
now located behind the Stanford
bookstore.
Shoes Keep Ilim Busy
"I work from 8 a.m. to (J p.m. every
day, so shoes take up most of my
time. When I go home, I always go
right to bed," Albert laughed. How
ever, Maurice said that in his spare
time his uncle raises rabbits and
chickens and takes care of his
garden.
Maurice likes to ice-skate occa
sionally and is a regular attendant
of the Wednesday night dances in
Palo Alto.
Like Stanford
The Delyon's think Stanford is the
best place they could possibly work.

They like all the boys and girls
(mostly girls, as evidenced by the
number of women's shoes in the
shop), and wouldn't leave Stanford
!'or anything.
