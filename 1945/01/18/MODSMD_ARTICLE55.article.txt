Do you want to become a better
dancer? If you do. then come to the
Music Room of the Art Gallery to
night at 9:15 for your first lesson.
The classes will be conducted by
Henry Elsasser, who was formerly
director of a dancing academy in
London.
Foundation steps of the foxtrot
and Viennese waltz will be taught at
the first class. The lessons will be
short and concentrated, so that the
student may learn to dance well in a
short period.
These classes are an extension of
the Army dancing classes which
have been held on campus for the
last few quarters, and all students
and faculty, both civilian and mili
tary, are cordially invited lo attend.
Future lessons will be held from
8:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. in the
Women's Clubhouse.
