# U.S. Forces Open Manila Road

### 
American forces breaking open the road to Manila after landings on
the Gulf of Lingayen are forging ahead on the great central plains of Luzon,
one of the most populous and normally productive areas of the Philippines.
Many small farms spread a mosaic over the face of the land, which is
settled chiefly by Tagalog-speaking Filipinos, who. together with the

Visayans, make up the dominant
racial group of the islands.
From the Lingayen Gulf port of
Dagupan, a doorway used by the
Japanese in their 1941 invasion, the
air distance to the Philippine capital
of Manila is a little more than 100
miles.
40-Mile Corridor
Intervening country is a broad,
open corridor averaging 40 miles
across and hemmed in on both sides
by mountains. On the west, the
highlands rise in spots to peaks of
5000 and GOOO feet. Southwest of the
central plainc stretches rugged Ba
taan Peninsula, scene of the stub
born American - Filipino defense
during the early Japanese triumphs.
The only elevation within the
plains corridor itself is isolated
Mount Arayat. in the south-central
section, nearly 4,000 feet high. In
the neighborhood, east and south to
Manila Bay, are also found Luzon's
only extensive swamplands, delta
country of the Pampanga and other
rivers.
Two Great Rivers
Two great river systems drain the
central plains of Luzon —the Agno
on the northwest, emptying into Lin
gayen Gulf, and the Pampanga on
the southeast, flowing into Manila
Bay. In peacetime these and other
river valleys produce a large share
of the Philippine food supply.
Some 40 per cent of the rice pro
duction came from this region, as
well as considerable sugar for ex
port. After the Japs took control, it
was reported that much of the
sugar-growing land had been turned
over to cotton cultivation, with one
or two of the remaining sugar mills
converted to industrial alcohol out
put.
Largest City—lG.3so
Chief settlement of the Luzon
plains is the town of Tarlac, with a
pre-war population of 16,3.50. Situ
ated in the west-central region, it is
the main rail and highway junction
of the corridor.
The fact that both railroads and
main highways run along the east
ern and western edges of the plains,
with connecting links crossing in
the north but avoiding the southern
swampy regions, is an indication of
the problems of rainy weather trans
port. In the wet season, most of this
central Luzon lowland has been de
scribed as a sponge, with troop
movements forced to stick to the
roads or the foothills of surrounding
uplands. National Geographic
