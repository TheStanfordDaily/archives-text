### MARION MORROW 
STANFOKD, Wednesday, Jan. 27,
1045, (P.O.) —Students of Stanford
University held a rally yesterday to
award medals, ribbons and "A's" to
members of the student body for
their meritorious service as hashers
in the Stanford Cellar.
In his presentation speech, "No"
Chocolatetoday, Cellar head hasher,
remarked, ". . . Never before in
Stanford history have students so
deserved recognition and reward as
these men and women who have
formed a regular crew of about eight
workers; three or four working from
7:30 a.m. to 8:15 a.m.; the same num
ber working from about 9 to 11:30 at
night . . . waiting on tables, washing
pots, and cleaning, drying, and oper
ating the dish machine. Il was a true
gesture of patriotism to make it pos
sible for Cellar fans far and wide to
purchase their after-dinner 101's. . .
Various other speakers related
stories of the Cellar's successful night
opening. "Macßeth" Are. a Cellar
gal from way back, told how sHe
had been going to the library nigrt
after night for two quarters, sittijnu
across from the nicest bov who lyad

never seemed able lo say one word
to her.
The nighl the Cellar opened, how
ever, he blurted out enthusiastically
'Wouldja lika Coke?" She said yes,
and now he's doing her "Daily"
headlines for her every night, of
which she has many—headlines, not
nights.
Many other situations resulting
from the romance-conducive Cellar
opening were brought to light.
The Cellar, it was said, when
opened at night is a regular party
time at 9:30 p.m., providing an ex
cellent relaxation period after a seri
ous nitfht of study. The most familiar
and pleasant harmony of the Stan
ford campus, it was continued, is the
phrase "Cellar-Time!"
The Daily would like very much
»o print an article like the above in
the next few weeks, but whether it
can or not depends on the spirit and
cooperation of the Stanford students
in providing a regular and perma
nent crew of Cellar hashers. The
work is fun. meeting the variety of
people interesting, and those medals
will come in handy for the scrap
drive.
