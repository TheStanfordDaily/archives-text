# HEY, FROSH ... A CHALLENGE!
## 
### 
"The frosh class is Stanford's largest class
. . . yet what has it got to unify its members
who are spread the length and breadth of the
campus?" This is the argument was very
effectively made before Excom by frosh lads
who wanted to bring Henry Busse's band to the
campus for roughly $1200.
Excom, of course, reaffirmed its stand that the
campus should refrain from unnecessary ex
penses and elaborate diversions during the
course of the war.
The freshmen seemed to challenge Excom's
position, as on the one hand there is a problem
of getting more students to participate in ac
tivities, and on the other they refuse to let the
freshmen throw a first-class activity that would
interest the whole r mpus.
There, is no argmucint that explains this para
dox; the only answer is that Excom and Stan
ford students are committed to a war policy
that is a basis for a realistic attitude that will
accomplish what is the Indian's small enough
share in war work, war contributions, and the
personal training in discipline and skills that
are public duties especially difficult at this time.
You frosh made an excellent showing for
your argument. Besides the spokesmen, there
v/as evidence that the affair as a whole was
pretty well thought out. Best of all, you seem
to have the desire to go somewhere as a class.
If this is the case, the Henry Busse affair will
not be a setback to you. You've come out of
high school more recently than any of us, and
high school doesn't indicate what war does to
society as a university does.
Many of you feel that you will be going into
the Army soon and it's good to have a fling
while you may. Well, as strange as it may
seem, the student body is carrying out its re
sponsibility to you by maintaining this policy.
The spirit and organization that was aroused
over this thing is what really counts, and if the
class of '48 is out for a lasting "good time,"
here's a little challenge.
Take that spirit into the campus organizations,
bring more ideas to Excom and your student
representatives. Organize as a class for the
coming Red Cross drives, the Con Home drive,
and Cardinal-sponsored all-campus affairs.
Stanford likes to see its freshmen throw a
little weight around, throw it in the right direc
tions. Hey, frosh?
