# IS THIS STANFORD?
## 
### 
Is this really Stanford? At times certain
things come up that make one wonder. We
have a definite code to follow at Stanford, but
it seems that certain individuals choose to laugh
at it, rather than accept the very foundation
upon which this University is based.
A concrete example of the violation of this
code came to us in the form of a plea to have
us notify the student body not to be dishonest.
Now this is quite an accusation to make but, sad
to relate, it is quite true.
John Jenkins of the Nitery mentions that in
the past it has been virtually impossible to keep
people from stealing everything but the walls
of that favorite night spot of Stanford Univer
sity. Two of the most popular things that have
been missing are radio tubes and ash trays. It
is certain that the Nitery doesn't hold enough
sentimental value for any student to become
so attached to certain inanimate objects that he
has to possess them for nostalgic reasons; so
I guess the answer is downright dishonesty.
The Nitery is managed by the A.S.S.U., and
the funds for operating come right out of our
pockets. You are being rationally unsound, if
you think that you are increasing your eco
nomic status by stealing from yourself.
The only place on the campus where the stu
dents can gather in the evening and have a
few moments of relaxation is the Nitery, and it
will open tonight.
It is too bad that certain people will try to
ruin something that is a benefit for the whole
group by merely trying to gain something for
themselves, even by stealing if necessary.
In closing, we again wish to inform you that
the Nitery cannot continue as a campus func
tion if these unfortunate happenings continue.
