### DICK BOWER 
Up with the alarm clock . . . there's fog spill
ing over the Coast Range onto your brain . . .
whistling "Marching Along Together" on the
way to breakfast ... in the Cellar, Merritt pour
ing coffee from a shiny thermos and wrapping
up sweet rolls.
A mad scramble to the eight o'clock and
you're late at that . . . smoke-time . . . your pen
runs dry in the nine o'clock and you should
have stayed in bed.
Coffee and chatter again in the Cellar . . .
snatches of conversation drift your way through
Bing Crosby's "Sweet and Lovely" . . . "Is he
really like that?" . . . "He must be a Psych
major" . . . "When the prof asked me what I
was doing in cqllege I replied, 'I was about to
ask you the same question'."
It's raining,outside and you don't make your
eleven o'clock . . . wading through puddles on
the way to lunch.
Lab's a sleepy affair . . . your drawings are
too diagrammatic . . . but who cares beside your
lab assistant and he's paid for it . . . you can't
see the seminiferous tubules . . . you curse
yourself for not taking that snap course.
Dinner . . . the fish is full of bones . . . the
ice-cream is a sticky mess . . .what did they
put into this coffee?
A letter to the folks . . . "Am really studying
this quarter" . . . "running a little short" . . .
"please send twenty-five" . . . "hope you are
all well."
A French test tomorrow . . . the imperfect
tense of "donner" . . . sometimes the French
book stays open at page 169.
The coke's a little green but Benny Moten's
record of "South" on the juke box more than
makes up for it . . . time to leave . . . well, just
one more.
Home again . . . some trivial talk . . . the
alarm's set for seven and you've had a tough
day . . . there'll be time to study tomorrow . . .
wind in the pines . . . rain on the roof . . . "Will
you guys please shut up? I'm a tired little
man." s

have stayed in bed.
Coffee and chatter again in the Cellar . . .
snatches of conversation drift your way through
Bing Crosby's "Sweet and Lovely" . . . "Is he
really like that?" . . . "He must be a Psych
major" . . . "When the prof asked me what I
was doing in cqllege I replied, 'I was about to
ask you the same question'."
It's raining,outside and you don't make your
eleven o'clock . . . wading through puddles on
the way to lunch.
Lab's a sleepy affair . . . your drawings are
too diagrammatic . . . but who cares beside your
lab assistant and he's paid for it . . . you can't
see the seminiferous tubules . . . you curse
yourself for not taking that snap course.
Dinner . . . the fish is full of bones . . . the
ice-cream is a sticky mess . . .what did they
put into this coffee?
A letter to the folks . . . "Am really studying
this quarter" . . . "running a little short" . . .
"please send twenty-five" . . . "hope you are
all well."
A French test tomorrow . . . the imperfect
tense of "donner" . . . sometimes the French
book stays open at page 169.
The coke's a little green but Benny Moten's
record of "South" on the juke box more than
makes up for it . . . time to leave . . . well, just
one more.
Home again . . . some trivial talk . . . the
alarm's set for seven and you've had a tough
day . . . there'll be time to study tomorrow . . .
wind in the pines . . . rain on the roof . . . "Will
you guys please shut up? I'm a tired little
man." s
