### Walrus the Carpenter THE WALRUS THE CARPENTER

With (he fundamental purposes of the University
so much in question, it is not surprising that the same
confusion of purpose existed among the students.
Needless to say, the war put a temporary end to the
more wasteful and vexatious student activities during
my first two years, but on its conclusion the former
cycle of purposeless student diversions came back into
vogue.
Fraternities were revived: freshman hazing became
a menace; college football and other sports, released
after so long a period, swept the country in a flood of
enthusiasm that was out of all proportion to their un
importance, and the growth of that unlovely insularity
known as "college spirit," so antagonistic to any ideal
of true education, resulted in a series of inter-Uni
versity punitive expeditions.
It was only then, rendered so unmistakably clear
by those follies, that serious people awoke to the fact
that something was radically out of order with higher
education everywhere in the world.
I shall not write about the student escapades of the
post-war period, amusing as they seem now in retro
spect. They were chiefly valuable in allowing a strong
contrast to be drawn between their violent excesses
and the relative simplicity of the student life during
the war years. This contrast was perhaps one of the
greatest factors in the reform of the Universities. It
provided a picture of what was actually possible.
It was no longer difficult to conceive the gilded
Stanford youth as incapable of any constructive social
action. During the war years the students had had to
do things for themselves; they had been forced to act
as their own chambermaids, gardeners, janitors, wait
ers and even farm-helpers. They had had to learn to
do without convertibles, ice-cream, off-campus dates,
mad frolics at the beach, and other pre-war amuse
ments.
The University too had partaken of this hardier at
titude. Young men who were disqualified were told
to leave and not to come back. The Army stood ever
ready to snatch the lower fringe of every class, and
this helped make even dull studies seem more attrac
tive. The extra discipline, even when self-imposed,
seemed occasionally a little harsh.
In the student dormitories, where a closer control
of student activities began to be exerted, some com
plaints were heard. But in the wild post-war period
the more serious and deliberate way of thinking that
had been current during the war looked very good in
retrospect.
My own most vivid memories are of those war years
at Stanford. I can still remember my feeling of awe
when I enrolled as a freshman. I was ready and willing
to learn; all learning seemed my province and I could
hardly be patient while waiting for the professors,
those privileged beings already acquainted with the
mysterious ways of Man and Nature, to introduce me
to their store of knowledge.
It took a long time before I saw my mistake. What
I learned, and I learned a great deal, was only slightly
derived from lectures and classrooms; it came chiefly
from student and faculty associations conducted some
times far away from the actual walls of the University.

that something was radically out of order with higher
education everywhere in the world.
I shall not write about the student escapades of the
post-war period, amusing as they seem now in retro
spect. They were chiefly valuable in allowing a strong
contrast to be drawn between their violent excesses
and the relative simplicity of the student life during
the war years. This contrast was perhaps one of the
greatest factors in the reform of the Universities. It
provided a picture of what was actually possible.
It was no longer difficult to conceive the gilded
Stanford youth as incapable of any constructive social
action. During the war years the students had had to
do things for themselves; they had been forced to act
as their own chambermaids, gardeners, janitors, wait
ers and even farm-helpers. They had had to learn to
do without convertibles, ice-cream, off-campus dates,
mad frolics at the beach, and other pre-war amuse
ments.
The University too had partaken of this hardier at
titude. Young men who were disqualified were told
to leave and not to come back. The Army stood ever
ready to snatch the lower fringe of every class, and
this helped make even dull studies seem more attrac
tive. The extra discipline, even when self-imposed,
seemed occasionally a little harsh.
In the student dormitories, where a closer control
of student activities began to be exerted, some com
plaints were heard. But in the wild post-war period
the more serious and deliberate way of thinking that
had been current during the war looked very good in
retrospect.
My own most vivid memories are of those war years
at Stanford. I can still remember my feeling of awe
when I enrolled as a freshman. I was ready and willing
to learn; all learning seemed my province and I could
hardly be patient while waiting for the professors,
those privileged beings already acquainted with the
mysterious ways of Man and Nature, to introduce me
to their store of knowledge.
It took a long time before I saw my mistake. What
I learned, and I learned a great deal, was only slightly
derived from lectures and classrooms; it came chiefly
from student and faculty associations conducted some
times far away from the actual walls of the University.

With (he fundamental purposes of the University
so much in question, it is not surprising that the same
confusion of purpose existed among the students.
Needless to say, the war put a temporary end to the
more wasteful and vexatious student activities during
my first two years, but on its conclusion the former
cycle of purposeless student diversions came back into
vogue.
Fraternities were revived: freshman hazing became
a menace; college football and other sports, released
after so long a period, swept the country in a flood of
enthusiasm that was out of all proportion to their un
importance, and the growth of that unlovely insularity
known as "college spirit," so antagonistic to any ideal
of true education, resulted in a series of inter-Uni
versity punitive expeditions.
It was only then, rendered so unmistakably clear
by those follies, that serious people awoke to the fact
that something was radically out of order with higher
education everywhere in the world.
