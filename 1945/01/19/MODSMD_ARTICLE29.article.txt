"FOLKLORE <N THE
THIRD PLATOON"
Six weeks have passed since the 1
termination of our training in the j
wilds of Florida. It was with deep j
•regret that we were forced to aban
don our field research on "Folklore
in the Third Platoon," a thesis which
we were preparing for our T.S. de
grees in infantry training. Therefore
in the interests of science and for the
advancement of culture, we have di
gested our copious notes and will re
port a few of the highlights of our I
findings.
A conversation between a Geor
gian and a Tennessean would pass
like 'this:
"Hey, Hank, yo'll know I just saw
Ned?"
"Sho' 'nuff—where?''
"Down yonder."
"You did?"
"Sho' 'nuff."
Evidently Hank knew where "yon
der" was. To us it still means any
direction within 360 degrees.
The most popular answer to the
question "When?" is "Directly,"
which is used to mean any time of
the day. And if Hank tells you he'll
see you this "evening," he means
he'll see you between noon and G
p.m., and not this evening because
"evening" means this afternoon and
not tonight. Also, he insists that
"thisaway" and "thataway" are ab
breviations for this way and that
way.
Now for the lads from the City of
Culture, where only the King's En
glish is spoken. These Bostonians
would be heard saying "Flip the pel
let" in place of "Trow da ball,"
which a resident of that unmention
able place across the river from
Manhattan would say. Also these
same Bostonians were falsely ac
cused of malapropism when one was
heard saying, "I think I'll give up
smoking. It irrigates my throat."
We were very fortunate in having
with us some of the Pennsylvania
Dutch. They have the unfamiliar
practice of using a question where a
statement would suffice. Instead of
saying "You shouldn't do that," they
would ask "Must you do that?" And
they never answer "Yes" to a ques
tion. It is always, "I believe it."
And so it goes on, each section of
the country claiming it speaks the
standard English.
Lest it be said that, as a result of
our studies, we have become biased,
we want it to go on record that "we"
| speak the standard English. Who
are we? We are members of the
Third Platoon.

Many times while staggering across
the Quad in a customary daze, some
young coed in disti'ess has stopped
us. Only yesterday one young damsel
flashed her dark eyes, (Evening at
Lagunita Mascara — a bargain at
$2.50) and murmured softly "Pardon
me, buddies, but whatsa goldbrick?"
For the benefit of this young lady
and the rest of questing humanity,
I we have asked Dr. I. C. Ssinkalot,
the noted lexicographer, to define a
number of military terms. After
weeks of diligent research, he offers
the following:
Goldbrick—B7.s3% of enlisted per
sonnel
Goof off—To enjoy life.
Goon—Potential officer.
Eager Beaver—A goon who tries.
Section Leader — An overeager
beaver.
Section eight — Studies on free
time.
Gig—Colossal' injustice.
Detail—Supercolossal injustice.
Restriction—"ls Life Worth Liv
ing?"
Obstacle course—The trail to Ro
ble.
O. D.—The Biggest Obstacle.
Bayshore—The never, never land.
T. S.—Life in general.
