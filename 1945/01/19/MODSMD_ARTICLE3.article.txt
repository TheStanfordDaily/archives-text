### 
LONDON, Jan. 18 (UP). Terming the great Ardennes battle
an "ever-famous American victory . . . likely to shorten this war,"
and praising the punctuality of the Red Army, Prime Minister
Winston Churchill today dramatically demanded the immediate
unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan.
Speaking on behalf of the United Nations in the first direct
surrender demand of any "Big Three" leader, Churchill told
Germany and Japan:
"If you surrender now nothing you will have to endure after
the war will be comparable to what you otherwise are going to
suffer during the year 1945."
The surrender demand was the unexpected climax of a two
hour speech in Parliament in which Churchill painted a highly
optimistic picture of the military situation around the world,
lavishly praised American military accomplishments, disclosed
that on the western front the American war effort is more than
double that of Britain, and told the world the "Big Three" military
alliance was stronger than it had ever been. On the political
side Churchill admitted minor "misunderstandings and difficul
ties" among the Allies which he hoped the coming conference
would erase.
