# Independents To Offer Twin Bill at Paly High
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
When the Palo Alto Independents
hit Redwood City's compact Sequoia
High School gym tonight at 8:00, they
will face what is being appropriately
tabbed the Bay Area's top cage
squad, namely, the San Bruno Navy.
Tomorrow night in the Palo Alto
High gym, the second half of a dou
bleheader will find the Independents
tackling Auten's a top civilian cage
.squad from Palo Alto. The opener
at 6:30 will pit the Independent re
serves against Menlo J. C.
Stanford basketball fans are thus
afforded the heaviest week-end of
hoop entertainment of the present
season, both nights bringing together
some of this area's most sensational
stars.
Santa Clara Game Off
A previously scheduled Santa
Clara game for tonight has been can
celled, according to Player-Coach
Dave Brown of the Palo Alto crew,
who arranged for the San Bruno
contest. Little did Brown know that
San Bruno had just ridden over St.
Marys Preflight. 46-42, in the sea
son's most startling upset.

The Navy outfit features John
Abromavic of Salem (W. Va.) Col
lege, who held the national colle
giate one-year scoring mark a few
years back. Against Preflight he
racked up 17 points. Blown plans
to start his affirmed first string with
Morley Thompson and George Bower
at forwards, Jack Heald at center,
and Ed Douglas and Brown, himself,
at the guard posts.
Thompson, the high-scoring PAI
threat, will face a former coach of
his, Carl Gustafson, who taught Mor
ley the rudiments of the game at
S. F.'s Lincoln High not so long ago.
Tonight's battle will tell whether the
coach or the student is supreme.
Thompson, incidentally, is the Palo
Altan's leading point-getter.
Menlo Unknown
The power of the lads from Menlo
Park is an unknown quantity, but
the Independents' reserve strength
will get a chance to test it in tomor
row night's curtain-raiser. Brown
named Rob Rosburg and Dick Mar
quette to start at forwards, Horace
Chandler at center, and Alan Mc-
Dowell and Dennis Fox at guards.
All these men have been steadily im
proving throughout the season.
Against Auten's, the Palo Alto club
will field the same starting lineup as
tonight in their 8:00 nightcap. Heinie
Hartwell, Tom Ashley, Luke Pitts
and Bobby Rowe are apt to see
plenty of action with the first team
on both nights. Rowe, a former In
dian frosh player, has looked good
in his recent appearances at the for
ward spot.
Tonight's Clash Free
The Independents beat the Auten
bunch, 48-42, in their last meeting,
but that was before the Autens
signed Norm Keeler, a former Paly
High ace. Tonight's game in Red
wood will be free, with 50 cents the
price of admission for tomorrow's
doubleheader. A large group of the
Stanford family is expected to view
from ihe sidelines.

lege, who held the national colle
giate one-year scoring mark a few
years back. Against Preflight he
racked up 17 points. Blown plans
to start his affirmed first string with
Morley Thompson and George Bower
at forwards, Jack Heald at center,
and Ed Douglas and Brown, himself,
at the guard posts.
Thompson, the high-scoring PAI
threat, will face a former coach of
his, Carl Gustafson, who taught Mor
ley the rudiments of the game at
S. F.'s Lincoln High not so long ago.
Tonight's battle will tell whether the
coach or the student is supreme.
Thompson, incidentally, is the Palo
Altan's leading point-getter.
Menlo Unknown
The power of the lads from Menlo
Park is an unknown quantity, but
the Independents' reserve strength
will get a chance to test it in tomor
row night's curtain-raiser. Brown
named Rob Rosburg and Dick Mar
quette to start at forwards, Horace
Chandler at center, and Alan Mc-
Dowell and Dennis Fox at guards.
All these men have been steadily im
proving throughout the season.
Against Auten's, the Palo Alto club
will field the same starting lineup as
tonight in their 8:00 nightcap. Heinie
Hartwell, Tom Ashley, Luke Pitts
and Bobby Rowe are apt to see
plenty of action with the first team
on both nights. Rowe, a former In
dian frosh player, has looked good
in his recent appearances at the for
ward spot.
Tonight's Clash Free
The Independents beat the Auten
bunch, 48-42, in their last meeting,
but that was before the Autens
signed Norm Keeler, a former Paly
High ace. Tonight's game in Red
wood will be free, with 50 cents the
price of admission for tomorrow's
doubleheader. A large group of the
Stanford family is expected to view
from ihe sidelines.
When the Palo Alto Independents
hit Redwood City's compact Sequoia
High School gym tonight at 8:00, they
will face what is being appropriately
tabbed the Bay Area's top cage
squad, namely, the San Bruno Navy.
Tomorrow night in the Palo Alto
High gym, the second half of a dou
bleheader will find the Independents
tackling Auten's a top civilian cage
.squad from Palo Alto. The opener
at 6:30 will pit the Independent re
serves against Menlo J. C.
Stanford basketball fans are thus
afforded the heaviest week-end of
hoop entertainment of the present
season, both nights bringing together
some of this area's most sensational
stars.
Santa Clara Game Off
A previously scheduled Santa
Clara game for tonight has been can
celled, according to Player-Coach
Dave Brown of the Palo Alto crew,
who arranged for the San Bruno
contest. Little did Brown know that
San Bruno had just ridden over St.
Marys Preflight. 46-42, in the sea
son's most startling upset.

The Navy outfit features John
Abromavic of Salem (W. Va.) Col
lege, who held the national colle
giate one-year scoring mark a few
years back. Against Preflight he
racked up 17 points. Blown plans
to start his affirmed first string with

at forwards, Jack Heald at center,
