## Tyler Edges by Betas, 17-16; Legal Eagles Dump Medics 
### 
Thrilling games characterized the
second round of intramural basket
ball last night as all teams showed up
for the appointed encounters. Two
of the earlier games were won by a
single point and only one team
scored more than 17 points during
the evening. Because of the lateness
of the hour at which they are played,
we are unable to report any account
of the late games except the scores,
as they do not end until after our
deadline.
One of yesterday's best games was
that in which a fighting Tyler de
feated the Beta team, 17 to 16. Paced
by Slobe, with 6 points to his credit,
the Hilltoppers took an early lead
and were still ahead at the half-time.
In the waning minutes of the game
the frat boys came to life, and were
within two points of victory when
the final gun cut short their efforts.
Ric Supple was a virtual one-man
blitz for the Betas, scoring ten of his
team's 16 digits to walk off with scor
ing honors for the afternoon.
Coming unexpectedly from be
hind in the closing minutes of the
contest, the underdog Legal Eagles
quintt'. upset the favored Med School
cage outfit, 15 to 14. With four min
uses to go in the game, the Medics
led 12-9, when two quick goals by
the Law School quintet and a free
throw by the Meds brought the
score to a 13-13 deadlock. After a
prolonged time-out. the teams went
back into play and the Meds once
again temporarily captured the lead
with a foul shot a moment later. With
less than a minute of play left, a
bucket from the fingers of Keller
from about three feet out cinched
the Eagles' victory. The game was
extremely rough, with both teams

exhibiting unusual spirit. The Meds
showed the much smoother defense
of the two, but could not seem to hit
the bucket.
Gerona, led by the sensational
Reische, completely swamped the
battling Arguello Whites, 30 to 17.
Reische scored 12 points to be high
scorer among all teams for the night.
Levy led the losers with six digits.
In late games, Buchanan overcame
an 8-0 Sequoia half-time lead to de
feat the Roughs, 14-10; and the high
ly regarded Phi Psi outlit, led by
Luke Pitts, completely swamped the
Arguello Cardinal team, which seems
unable to be unable to maintain the
reputation it gained during grid sea
son. The score was 30 to 18. The
Cards led at the half, 10-9.

for the appointed encounters. Two
of the earlier games were won by a
single point and only one team
scored more than 17 points during
the evening. Because of the lateness
of the hour at which they are played,
we are unable to report any account
of the late games except the scores,
as they do not end until after our
deadline.
One of yesterday's best games was
that in which a fighting Tyler de
feated the Beta team, 17 to 16. Paced
by Slobe, with 6 points to his credit,
the Hilltoppers took an early lead
and were still ahead at the half-time.
In the waning minutes of the game
the frat boys came to life, and were
within two points of victory when
the final gun cut short their efforts.
Ric Supple was a virtual one-man
blitz for the Betas, scoring ten of his
team's 16 digits to walk off with scor
ing honors for the afternoon.
Coming unexpectedly from be
hind in the closing minutes of the
contest, the underdog Legal Eagles
quintt'. upset the favored Med School
cage outfit, 15 to 14. With four min
uses to go in the game, the Medics
led 12-9, when two quick goals by
the Law School quintet and a free
throw by the Meds brought the
score to a 13-13 deadlock. After a
prolonged time-out. the teams went
back into play and the Meds once
again temporarily captured the lead
with a foul shot a moment later. With
less than a minute of play left, a
bucket from the fingers of Keller
from about three feet out cinched
the Eagles' victory. The game was
extremely rough, with both teams

exhibiting unusual spirit. The Meds
showed the much smoother defense
of the two, but could not seem to hit
the bucket.
Gerona, led by the sensational
Reische, completely swamped the
battling Arguello Whites, 30 to 17.
Reische scored 12 points to be high
scorer among all teams for the night.
Levy led the losers with six digits.
In late games, Buchanan overcame
an 8-0 Sequoia half-time lead to de
feat the Roughs, 14-10; and the high
ly regarded Phi Psi outlit, led by
Luke Pitts, completely swamped the
Arguello Cardinal team, which seems
unable to be unable to maintain the
reputation it gained during grid sea
son. The score was 30 to 18. The
Cards led at the half, 10-9.
Thrilling games characterized the
second round of intramural basket
ball last night as all teams showed up
for the appointed encounters. Two
of the earlier games were won by a
