BERKELEY, Jan. 18 â€” Learning
that the Trojans are notorious on the
backboards offensively and defen
sively. Coach Nibs Price named Cali
fornia's tallest players to the travel
ing squad for Saturday's tilt with
Southern California in Los Angeles.
In previous games the southern
ers, averaging over 6.3, have gar
nered most of their points on follows
and tip-ins. On defense they have
used their unusual height to close
the board and force their opponents
to depend on long shots for scoring.
Price has named three men who
are 6 ft., 4 in. to the ten-man squad
that leaves tonight; Jim Farrel, first
string center; Ed Honnan, reserve
forward, and Stu Bartholomew, fast
improving reserve center moved up
from the jayvee squad. These three,
along with/forward Gus Mota, 6.1,
and Guard Jack Leonard, 6.1, may
be the combination to beat the Tro
jans.
The game will be a crucial in the
southern division race as the Trojans
are picked to win the title, while
California is defending champion.
Troy is a definite favorite, having
defeated UCLA 53-25, which in turn
jolted California last weekend, 37-26.
The complete traveling squad in
cludes Gus Mota, George Clyne, Ed
Honnan, Rob Rutherford, and Ray
Lucas or Merrill Callow, forwards',
Jim Farrel 1 and Stu Bartholomew,
centers; and Bob Hogeboom, Jack
Leonard, and Leland Arth, guards.
