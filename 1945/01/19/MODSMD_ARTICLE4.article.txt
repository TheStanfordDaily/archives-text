# Op en House To Feature 'Y' Speaker
## 
### 
j For the first time since the
; Y.W.C.A. netted itself a record inem-
Ijership of 1,055 campus women last
! quarter, all "Y" members will have
â™¦ho opportunity to meet together, at
the 1915 Open House at 7:15 tonight
in the Women's Clubhouse.
In the hope that all new women
on campus may become acquainted
with the "Y," its members, and its
functions, Secretary Nancy Banning,
in charge of tonight's affair, particu
larly invites them to attend.
Miss Carol Levene, recently re
turned from overseas duty with the
j Red Cross, and momentarily expect
| ing to again go overseas, has agreed
' to speak tonight, despite a full
schedule, because she has a message
of special interest to Stanford wom
en. according to Miss Banning. All
j other talks which she had previously
; scheduled outside of San Francisco
have been canceled.
Miss Levene helped the enlisted
men in Iceland enjoy Christmas by
I converting barren huts into recre
! ation centers. She also had many
| harrowing experiences while work
i ing in England before and after the
! invasion.
A graduate of Lowell High School
in San Francisco, Miss Levene at
tended the University of California
; until 1935, whore she was active on
! the Daily Californian. She was state
; supervisor of training for recrea
i tional leaders in the San Francisco
WPA before she began doing Red
i Cross work.
It. is hoped that all "Y" members
will attend the affair, but new wom
| en on campus are especially desired
i in order that they may become ac
quainted with the officers, members,
I and facilities of the "Y."
