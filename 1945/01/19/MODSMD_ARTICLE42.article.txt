Perhaps we are a little late with
this, having been scooped by Your
Hasher. Joe Sher, but we really did
intend to bring up the subject of
attendance of students at mural
sports events. We are all in favor of
having our intramural basketball
games viewed by the students in
general. In as much as mural sports
are the only official form of athletics
on the campus, one would think that
a large number of the local men and
women would temporarily abandon
their books to watch the boys give
their all for the team. We would like
to suggest this, especially to the
large number of people hereabouts
who are continually raising the roof
because Stanford has no intercolle
giate athletic program.
Students would have gotten more
than their money's worth if they had
bothered to journey down to the

football practice fields on Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons last quarter
when mural grid was in full swing.
The large crowd which turned out
for the championship playoff between
Arguello and Company C did not
seem to think that their time had
been wasted. Nor did the group of
enthusiastic women who watched the
Cellar-dwelling Buchanan Bearcats
slaughter the Lagunita All-Star
baseball team at the end of Spring
Quarter.

Yours truly believes sincerely that
he has set a record with today's
sports page, on which he wrote every
single article, except the one bearing
Gordon Levy's by-line and the wea
ther forecast. That comes to about
48 column inches, which ain't hay.
Don't be surprised if you don't hear
from us again for the next month, as
i we will be at home in bed.
