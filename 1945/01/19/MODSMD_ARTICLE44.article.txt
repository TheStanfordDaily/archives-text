## 
### 
Six more teams have been added j
to the winter quarter intramural j
basketball league, rounding out the
total of teams participating to 17,
Harry Wolter, intramural director,
announced yesterday. The six teams
are all composed of Army men from j
Company A and Company C of the
ASTU. They have not as yet been
officially admitted to the league, as
none have chosen names to distin
guish them.
The regular intramural schedule
of games on Tuesday and Thursday
nights will be followed, Mr. Wolter
stated. There will be four games
each in the Pavilion and Encina Gym j
at 7:15 and four more in each at
8:15, or a total of 16 games per night.
This will require several more offi- |
cials for the contests, and persons j
interested in this work are urged to i
see Mi - . Wolter at once. Mr. Wolter
has not yet decided how to enter
the teams into league competition j
without upsetting schedules, inas- !
much as there have already been
two rounds of official play.
Mr. Wolter urged that all teams
in the league show up promptly for |
scheduled games, since referees are
provided by him for the contests; j
and they, as well as the night watch- !
man and Mr. Wolter himself, are !
unnecessarily detained by lateness '
or defaults.
