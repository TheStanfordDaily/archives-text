# Goldman, Levinson, Nielsen, Sadler Tell Experiences at Vocom Program
## 
### 
Sallic Van Dyke last night re
signed as vice-president of Wom
en's Conferencei, leaving vacant
her position in the forthcoming
election. Women wishing to he
come candidates should follow the
prescribed procedure.

Telling of their experiences in
new jobs, four Stanford graduates
entertained a group in the Women's
Clubhouse last night at 7:15 p.m.
Sponsored by Women's Vocom, un-

der Chairman
Sybil Harrison,
the four were
Marianne Gold
man, Jean Lev
inson, Marian
Nielsen, and
Barbara Sadler.
Marianne Gold
man, who is now
working for the
San Francisco
Chronicle, said
(hose expecting

newspaper offices to be "nothing but
cigarette butts and men with their
feet on desks with their hats pushed
back" would be disappointed in the
Chronicle and its "calm, collected at
mosphere."
Interviewing a JRe'l Cross worker
just back from 18 months overseas
was one story Miss Goldman told.
Miss Levinson works in an adver
tising agency, helping with radio ac
counts. She told of pounding pave
ments for lack of specific experience.

A variety of work from writing radio
shows to "following a producer
around and giving him a pencil when
he wants it." But she adds, "No sing
ing commercials!"
In discussing how her education
had benefited her. Miss Levinson de

clared that the experience gained in
the Stanford Radio Institute had
helped. She also stressed the prac
tical application of extracurricular
activities such as working for the
Daily and in theater productions. She
decided that perhaps had she taken
an art course it would help in
sketching a layout. Shorthand can
just as easily be learned at Stanford
as in a business course. Above all,
she said, know what you want to do.

Miss Nielsen is
now working
with a chemical
firm. Because it
is a fairly small
business she was
able to get a va
ried experience,
secretarial work,
purchasing, jug
gling priorities,
and some adver
tising. She also
stressed the
prestige of a
master's degree

in Business Administration.
Ensign Sadler, who is in the
Waves, told of her work as a re
cruiter. At the present time her
work as cable censor is secret.
