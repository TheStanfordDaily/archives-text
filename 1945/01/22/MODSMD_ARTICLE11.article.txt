# Bridge Dubs, You Can Win
## 
### 
Have you trumped your partner's
ace lately?
Do you always bid four on a jack
high hand?
You do?
Cardinals is this week offering you
the opportunity to win the mysteri
ous booby prize being offered for
lowest partners in the all-campus
bridge tournament. Beginning Fri
day, the tournament is also open to
more confident players who wish to
aim at the first and second prize sets
donated by Roos Bros., or for the
bonds to be given to the winning
partnership.
Entry blanks, contributed by Roos
Bros., appear in today's Daily, so that
students who have already selected
their partners may be among the first
to notify Chairman Margery Troy
i of their intent to play.
Playoffs, once the entrants have
reached a manageable number
\ through elimination, will be held in
the Nitcry over a two-week period,
I ending with the finals February 9.
i As players approach the finals, a 25-
I cent defense stamp will be charged
| for every playoff to pay for the two
! prize bonds.
Entries must be made by Wednes-
I day at 5 p.m., according to Miss Troy
and may be made by stuffing the
j filled-out entry blanks into the boxes
j on History Corner and in the Cellar.
According to Miss Troy, the pur
i pose of the tournament is to encour-
I age greater student participation,
l and to provide relaxation for harried
students before midterms. Rumor has
j it that the sign-up is already large.
