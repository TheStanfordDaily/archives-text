To most persons the why of the preferential
system of voting is no more than a mysterious
and bothersome procedure. It takes much less
thought to mark merely your first choice than
it does to figure out which candidates you would
see hold the office if your favorite should lose.
And as for the advantages of the system or the
method of countingâ€”only Einstein could hope
to understand such a problem.
But actually the preferential system is neither
mysterious nor bothersome; it just takes a little
more time and thought, a little more interest and
curiosity on the part of the voter, and the meth
od of counting ballots is at first confusing but
becomes simpler after a time.
When there are only two candidates running
for one office, the preferential isn't necessary
since it is assumed that the candidate other than
the one indicated by the voter is that voter's
second choice. (He obviously has no other.)
But when there are more than two candidates
the picture is different. For example, let's say
there are five candidates running for the office
of campus cleanup chairman. Candidate "A" is
backed by one group, candidate "B" by another
etc. Each group wants a certain candi
date and each group tries to get as many in
between voters to choose its candidate.
And so when the votes are tallied, candidate
"A" has 150, candidate "B" 151, candidate "C"
146, etc. No one candidate receives a majority.
Under the preferential system, a candidate
has to reach a majority before he is elected. Tak
ing the same groups and candidates as ex
amples it would work out like this:
The group supporting candidate "A," the
group backing "B," and the group backing "C"
all want to see their man win. Suppose candi
date "A" had the biggest group behind him,
and the balloting was not done according to
preferential; he would win.
But if voting were done under the preferen
tial system, a few other facts might come to
light. Suppose "A" did get the highest number
of first choices. But then suppose that the group
supporting "A" thought that "B" was a good
guy, and they gave him their second choices.
All of the group supporting "C" thought "B"
was good, too, and so he got their second
choices.
In this case "B" would win and rightly so
since most of the voters wanted him next to
their particular favorite. No one faction could
take over and no one faction could push their
candidate into office. It merely means that the
best all-around man is the winner.
