# HISTORY -1945

### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Both the Western and the Eastern theaters of war
are in full action. With Allied intentions in the West
still threatened, with the Russians advancing 25 to 50
miles a day on some sectors of their front, the German
general staff is being called upon to make its biff de
fensive effort of 1945.
Their countermeasures in the East are beginning
to become apparent. First of all, Hungary has sur
rendered. The enemy took a gamble in fighting as long
as he did in that country; he lost, and. under the pres
sure of events, he is changing his strategy.
He is trying to shorten his lines, so it might not be
surprising to see the Russian army rolling across the
Austrian border, through Vienna, and then to the gates
of southern Germany without too much opposition.
The Germans will probably fall back for as much as
100 miles to the narrow, 30-mile-long corridor between
the Alps and the Bohmerwald mountains on the
Czechoslovak frontier. This line, on the Bavarian fron
tier, is broken and mountainous, and its front is cov
erad by the Inn river. It can be held much more lightly
than the former Hungarian front, and the withdrawal
to this point will thus release new reserves for the
North,
The second thing of interest is the rapid German
retreat in Silesia. The geography of Germany in
this sector and the mobility of modern war industry
are two factors governing enemy strategy here.
The checkmate of the Russian armies along the Vis
tula for the better part of last year might have given
the enemy crucial time. Before the war, he could lose
Silesia and still fight on. Later, because of Allied aerial
action, he moved his heavy industry into the province.
Now he might have shifted it back again, and will thus
be ready to sacrifice Silesia for the geographical reason.
A look at the map will show that Silesia is a narrow
finger sticking out from southeastern Germany, and
thrusting in between Poland and Czechoslovakia. Thick
forests and high mountains run across the knuckle
bone, and these are highly defensible.
Since the Germans are giving ground much more
rapidly in the northern end of their Polish front than
on the southern, their big try might be to contract
their southern front to a line running from the Alps,
up and behind the Bohmerwald mountains (their
double retrograde movement in the Balkans and in
Silesia uncovering Czechoslovakia) to the Silesian
knuckle; then to shift as many reserves as possible to
the North to at least hold these anil possibly to launch
counteroffensive, aimed at Warsaw and at cutting
the Russians off from their bases on the Vistula. The
latter is admittedly a rather optimistic plan if il is in
existence, but a Napoleonic stroke is necessary to Ger
man survival, and the Russians have been advancing
so rnj ' that they might soon find dangerous need to
consolw ' . Then the enemy would have an opening, if
lie is strong enough to take it.
