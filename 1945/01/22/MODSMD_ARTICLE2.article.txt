### 
GEN. MacARTHUR'S HDQ., Monday, Jan. 22 (U.R)â€”U. S. Sixth Army
troops have captured the big communications center of Tarlac and struck
on beyond it to within 58 miles of Manila, it was announced today.
Tarlac was taken Saturday after a 13-mile advance. The Americans
also seized Lastaz, ten miles to the southeast, and 58 miles north of Manila.

Lastaz is only 14 miles west of High
way No. 5, the last link between the
Japanese in northern and southern
Luzon.
Two airdromes at Tarlac, a town
of 17,000, also were captured.
A drive carried the American lines
44 airline miles into Luzon from Lin
gayen beaches where the Yanks
stormed ashore two weeks ago on
the last lap of their march back to
Bataan, Corregidor and Manila.
Tarlac is at the junction of sur
faced highways No. 3 and 13 along
which the Americans had struck
southward along the shortest routes
to Manila.
Only 21 miles south of the Ameri
can tank and infantry spearhead
surging towards Manila against light
enemy resistance, lay the Clark air
field, battered almost ceaselessly
during the past month by American
bombers.
