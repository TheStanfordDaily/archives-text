team, composed almost exclusively
of Stanford students, enrolled in
Coach Ted Mumby's wrestling class,
fought to a overwhelming victory in
the Northern California YMCA
wrestling tournament held on the
mats of the Berkeley YMCA gym
last Saturday. Despite the inexperi
ence of the group, some of whom had
never competed in the sport, the
Farm boys scored 30 points to the 17
of the runner-up Sequoia High

11 digits marked up by a pitiful Cali
fornia squad.

class, Charley Clark and Bob Miller,
both of Stanford, were pitted against
each other in the finals. Clark's vic
tory netted 7 points for the Y team
and Miller garnered 3 for second
place. Donn Kellesheim and Bob
Pitsker, who were jumped up from
the IGS-lb. class to the heavyweights,
were overpowered by the sheer mass
of their huge opponents.
In the 145-lb. weight, two Stanford
boys again reached the final round
to sweep all the points for this event;
Henry Pansford registered a win
over Sheldon Butt, who was making
his debut on the mats. George Bevier
took the 13G-lb. class for the Paly
team.
Oscar Thompson and Joe Martinez
reached the semi-finals in the 165-lb.

thusiasts entered. Thompson lost out
in an overtime bout, which was given

struggled to two wins before he was
nosed out in the third round of the
finals.
