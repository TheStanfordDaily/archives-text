## 
### GORDON LEVY 
With nearly 600 spectators looking on, half of them enthusiastic Stanford students, the Palo Alto Independ- |
ents, fresh from their startling win over San Bruno Navy the night before, dropped a nip-and-tuck basketball
tussle to Auten's, 50-44, in the Palo Alto High "house of hoop" Saturday night. In the curtain-raiser, the Inde
pendent reserves lost to Menlo Junior College, 45-35.
As previously billed, the Auten game turned into a duel between the PAl's Morley Thompson and Auten's

; Bruno is rated one of the Buy's finest
' squads by virtue of its 48-42 win over
I St. Marys Preflight last week.

Norm Keeler, a former Paly High â™¦
sensation. Thompson dumped in 14
points against Keeler's effort of 13.
But high point honors of the eve
ning went to Monk Moyers of the
winners, who sent seven field goals
and three free throws through the
netting for a total of 17.
Knot Score
The Independents, coached by !
Dave Brown, trailed all the way
through the initial half, with Auten's
holding a 25-22 advantage at the
rest period. Buckets by Thompson
and Ed Douglas, flashy guard, knot
ted the score at 28-28 early in the
second half, but the Palo Altans were
unable to thwart the surging Moy- I
ers, who once again began to find
his eye.
With scarcely six minutes left to
play, the Independents looked as '
though they were off to a last-min
ute victory after Douglas, who scored j
12 for the night, and Brown began
hitting the hoop. A tight Auten de
fense kept the margin intact until
the final gun.
The Reserves, after leading 25-15
at the half, bowed before a sharp
Menlo offense in the final quarter,
with Andy Rosehill of Menlo scor
ing 21 points to take high honors.
Bobby Rosburg counted 8 for Palo
Alto with Center Horace Chandler j
dumping in 7.
San Bruno Tilt Close
Against San Bruno in the Sequoia |
High gym in Redwood City, the In- |
dependents, behind 34-16 with 10 I
minutes to go, pulled everyone of the
few onlookers o(T his seat with a ter

in a 44-43 victory for Brown's team.
The last-minute rally, which was
nothing short of sensational, found
Douglas, Thompson, and Brown all
swishing the net with every attempt.

Brown grabbed scoring honors j
with 15 points, but Douglas bucketed
ten points in the last quarter. San I
