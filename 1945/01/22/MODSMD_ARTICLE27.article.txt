# Californians Button Up

### 
Nine out of ten people interviewed
Saturday admitted that it was colder
than usual. The only exception, a
Northerner from Portland, boasted
that it gets so coid up there that holes
must be chopped through the ice in
the Willamette River in order to al
low the sewage to infiltrate through
the water molecules of the river.
"Nevertheless," he said, as he shook
some excess Portland rain from his
coat, "I must admit it was cool to
day."
Another teller of tall tales who
must hail from Phoenix, said the fol
lowing about Saturday's 34 mini
mum, "Now I know what it is to be
a stifT."
Any relation to the above "inter
views" that might have occurred if
there had been interviews in the
first place, is secondary, inconse
quential, and impossible.
Since very few students were up
early enough Sunday morning to
freeze in the 33 temperature, it
has been difficult to form any opin
ion as to whether it was as cold as
Saturday morning 34 \
