(Ed. nolo: This is another in the series of articles 011 department heads.)

Philosophy ought not to be shelved in wartime, but should be used to
evaluate scientific findings and to coordinate all our university work for the
sake of a truly liberal education, according to John R. Reid, acting head
of the Philosophy Department.
Returning to the campus after a year's leave of absence on a Guggen-

heim Fellowship, the Georgia-born
professor considers that college
courses in philosophy ought not to be
merely '"philosophy for philosophy's
sake."
"Good philosophy," Dr. Reid
claims, "is not speculative moon
shine; it is not 'up in the clouds.'
On the contrary, it is a set of effective
methods for getting down and stay
ing down to earth and for making
progress in directions that critical
evaluation show to be desirable."
Kit-h Background
Professor Reid has had a rich
background of study. He attended
Columbia University, receiving his
Ph.D. at the University of California-
He has been awarded several fellow
ships and recently taught one sum
mer at the University of British Co
lumbia.
"I first became interested in phi
losophy when I went to Columbia,"
Dr. Reid recalled. He was very much
impressed by the teachings of John
Dewey and George Santayana.
Even during wartime, the annual
enrollment in the department has
averaged between 350 and 400 stu
dents.
Wide Interests
In addition to philosophy, Dr. Reid
is very interested in modern French
painting, the theatre, and music. Not
the least of his accomplishments is
writing. He is the author of "A The
ory of Value," published in 1939, as
well as of numerous articles dealing
with problems in ethics, semantics
and theory of value.
From wartime thinking, Dr. Reid
takes an example to show the need
of logic and philosophy in everyday
thought. "The Japs," even our 'ex
perts' told vis, "are near sighted and
cannot shoot straight." But we have
learned the hard way that their gun
nery is excellent and that U. S. ob
servers were naively deceived in the
open practice sessions. A good
course in logic would have raised the
critical threshholds of even a dull
person to the point that he would
not have been taken in by this mix
ture of lies, propaganda, and wish
ful thinking."
Quotes Stimson
In his support of his belief that
philosophical study is necessary
even in wartime, Dr. Reid quotes
Secretary of War Stimson, saying
"emphasis should be put on basic
understanding and thoroughness
rather than on a superficial smatter

ing in a multitude of so-called
fense' courses."
Students in wartime are rightly
intent on acquiring technical skills
and scientific information immedi
ately useful. But Dr. Reid believes
that there will be an increased in
terest in the study of philosophy
after ihe war.
