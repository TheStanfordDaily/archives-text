# Flying Enthusiasts To Meet Tomorrow
## 
### 
There will be a meeting Tuesday
evening at 7:30 in the Nitery for
those people interested in organizing
a flying club. Everyone is invited,
whether they have had previous fly
ing experience or not. The ban on
coastal flying should be lifted before
the end of this month which would
make flight instruction again pos
sible, and it would be wise to organ
ize a club now and purchase a plane
while they are still available, ac
cording to Ray H. Elsmore, who can
be reached at Tyler Hall, 8644.
