# THE 						SOCIAL WHIRL
## 
### 
People are still running around campus these days trying to
give student activities that "shot in the arm" that has been the
cry during wartime. The prime astonisher among the proposals
yet offered was presented to Excom not so long ago.
Blossom Parke, speaking for Cardinals, wondered, appar
ently in vain, if perhaps just a few less "shots in the arm" might
not give the reeling social calendar of the ASSU a chance to
get hold of itself.
Big-name-bandless, football-team-less, and most-definitely
manless Stanford students are confronted with more than a half
dozen all-campus dances (kinds: with men,, get-your-own-man,
formal, informal, anti-formal, and just plain folk dancing).
The intellectuals are confronted weekly with a Tuesday
Series lecture, a YWCA lecture, International Club lectures, and
the newly created snare, the Faculty Forum, bi-weekly.
This fare is sprinkled liberally with open houses, .firesides,
exchange dinners, and a daily entertaining issue of the Daily.
This furore of activity is notable in one respect—a few are busy
planning and attending all, while bridge holds the many in its
deathly grip.
It seems only sensible that the way to help the student body
get together, as it no longer does, is to discard the business of
every living group and coterie filling every idle moment with
lime-consuming nonsense, each pulling against the other, while
the bewildered student gives up trying to decide belween a
dozen scattered affairs and his econ notes.
The increased extent and responsibility of studying in war
time means that campus events be fewer, more extensive and
diverting. Now is the time to work hard and now is the time to
play hard.
Why can't every group do thoroughly one part of each large
activity that will turn out practically every student on campus?
Two or three activities a quarter on the scale of the Con
Home Drive would be an effective social program for us. The
idea may be catching hold that minor date-fillers can be dropped
even this quarter and Cardinal's Tradition Week, The Ram's
Head Dramatic Skits, or the Red Cross Drive can pull every liv
ing group class and organized activity into some ALL-CAMPUS
fun that will stick with us for awhile.
We have been pursuing the hectic business of filling every
date for too long, and still have no successful social program.
Let's make a few things bigger and better and especially, with
everybody who can navigate attending.
Who'll surrender their sovereignty first? They'll get a three
foot headline!

The intellectuals are confronted weekly with a Tuesday
Series lecture, a YWCA lecture, International Club lectures, and
the newly created snare, the Faculty Forum, bi-weekly.
This fare is sprinkled liberally with open houses, .firesides,
exchange dinners, and a daily entertaining issue of the Daily.
This furore of activity is notable in one respect—a few are busy
planning and attending all, while bridge holds the many in its
deathly grip.
It seems only sensible that the way to help the student body
get together, as it no longer does, is to discard the business of
every living group and coterie filling every idle moment with
lime-consuming nonsense, each pulling against the other, while
the bewildered student gives up trying to decide belween a
dozen scattered affairs and his econ notes.
The increased extent and responsibility of studying in war
time means that campus events be fewer, more extensive and
diverting. Now is the time to work hard and now is the time to
play hard.
Why can't every group do thoroughly one part of each large
activity that will turn out practically every student on campus?
Two or three activities a quarter on the scale of the Con
Home Drive would be an effective social program for us. The
idea may be catching hold that minor date-fillers can be dropped
even this quarter and Cardinal's Tradition Week, The Ram's
Head Dramatic Skits, or the Red Cross Drive can pull every liv
ing group class and organized activity into some ALL-CAMPUS
fun that will stick with us for awhile.
We have been pursuing the hectic business of filling every
date for too long, and still have no successful social program.
Let's make a few things bigger and better and especially, with
everybody who can navigate attending.
Who'll surrender their sovereignty first? They'll get a three
foot headline!
People are still running around campus these days trying to
give student activities that "shot in the arm" that has been the
cry during wartime. The prime astonisher among the proposals
yet offered was presented to Excom not so long ago.
Blossom Parke, speaking for Cardinals, wondered, appar
ently in vain, if perhaps just a few less "shots in the arm" might
not give the reeling social calendar of the ASSU a chance to
get hold of itself.
Big-name-bandless, football-team-less, and most-definitely
manless Stanford students are confronted with more than a half
dozen all-campus dances (kinds: with men,, get-your-own-man,
formal, informal, anti-formal, and just plain folk dancing).
