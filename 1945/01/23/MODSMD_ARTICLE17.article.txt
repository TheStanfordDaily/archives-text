election by preferential ballot.)
DON'T vote carelessly tomorrow, just paying attention to your
first choices and then marking the rest of the ballot diagonally
or because you like the sound of a certain candidate's name.
This morning's paper gives you the names of all those in the
running. Ask your friends about the persons you don't know.
Why all this trouble? Because your second, third, and
fourth, etc., choices can pack as big a wallop as your first.
Here's how the preferential is counted:
First-choice votes are counted and tallied, and the ballots
are arranged in piles so that each pile contains the first choice
ballots of a single candidate.
If no candidate receives a majority of first choices, the one
receiving the lowest number of first choices is dropped from
the voting list and the votes credited to him are scratched from
'he tally sheet.
The second-choice votes on the ballots of this candidate are
rounted and the ballots placed in the piles of those receiving
•hese second choices. These are tallied and counted and the
-andidate having a majority of the total votes cast is the winner.
If still a majority has not been reached, the candidate with
he lowest number of votes is scratched out of the race. The
stx jnd-choice votes on the ballots of this candidate are counted
:nd the ballots placed in the piles of those receiving these second

choices. However, if these second choices are for the candidate
already disqualified, the third choice is counted. If a majority
vote has been reached after this tally, no further counting is
necessary.
If no election has resulted, the procedure is repeated until a
majority vote is reached. In doing this, preference for candidates
already dropped is ignored and the next preference for a name
still on the voting list is counted.
And that is the preferential system. If Stanford voters vote
intelligently, it works as it should, with that candidate who is an
all-around favorite emerging victorious. *
