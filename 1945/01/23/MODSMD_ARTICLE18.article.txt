### Walrus the Carpenter 
AFTER THE DELUGE . . .
A description in a recent TIME tells what happened where
the path of war has passed: "Warsaw has a deathly stillness.
In the whcle panorama from Poniatcwski Bridge to Kierbedz
bridge (both wrecked) there was not a single sign o/ human
life. The buildings are not all flattened—some walls still stand,
but they are shells. . . ."
Damaged buildings can be destroyed or replaced, but what
can be done for the millions of human beings who suffered
through the years of destruction? We do not know how to re
pair the vast damage that has been done to men's minds and
souls. Europe lacks hope, faith, and courage; and without these,
why live?
The vast upheavals of the social, political, and economic revo
lutions have upset and undermined the principles and customs
that people take for granted as permanent and unchangeable.
Uncertain of themselves and their future, they are ready
for the dictator who takes all responsibility, answers all ques
tions, and assures all minds. Some 'men will have been crip
pled from loss of limbs or senses. Some will have their minds
deranged, others their emotions unbalanced or their charac
ters affected.
And everywhere there will be the memory of war, hate, fear,
hunger, and suffering: things that don't pass easily from the
mind or leave it unaffected.
What has happened, and what is now happening in Europe
is brutal and to exaggerate the picture would gain nothing, but
to avoid the picture, to refuse to face it, is callous and unfor
giveable escapism.
Somehow, and from somewhere, must come strength, cour
age, and the faith to solve the problems this world presents, after
the deluge has ceased.
