The German action on the Western
front has abruptly ceased. Twenty
divisions with which Von Rundstedt
fought his Belgian battle have disap
peared. The enemy counterattack
around Strasbourg has halted of its
own accord.
The Germans might be doing one
of two things. Either they are mass
ing for a new counteroffensive in
order to completely break up any
plans for attack that we might have,
or else they are shifting everything
to the East.
The latter seems most likely. We
already have heard that four divi
sions, three infantry and one arm
ored, have made the trip across Ger
many. So far, the enemy is bolster
ing his eastern line by parts, sending
in a new division to cover the retreat
of a mauled army corps, or some
thing like that. He undoubtedly Real
izes that his opportunity for any sort

of stand or countermeasure is not
yet at hand. With this fact in mind,
it is dubious that he would have
drawn his units from the West in
stead of the few in central reserve
inside Germany if lie intended to
strike in the West. Yet this is quali
fied by the question: "Does he have
any central reserve?"
The second alternative is that the
German high command is shifting
its weight now.
If it is, then it is counting on the
Belgian Bulge Battle to have so
mauled our offensive plans that we
cannot strike for the present. Should
further events prove them to be
right, then that battle, though a tac
tical defeat for Von Rundstedt, was
one of his greatest strategical vic
tories.
