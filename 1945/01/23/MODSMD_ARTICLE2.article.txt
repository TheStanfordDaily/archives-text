LONDON, Tuesday, Jan. 23 (U.R)-
Unconfirmed reports from neutral
Stockholm said today that Germans
had started mass civilian evacua
tion of Berlin as Russians swept to
within IGS miles of the capital and
Nazi propagandists said that the
"great hour of our most severe test
has come."
The Stockholm newspaper Afton
bladet quoted neutral diplomats ar
riving in Bern, Switzerland, from
Berlin as saying they saw long col
umns of heavily laden trucks driven
by Nazi storm troopers leaving the
Reich, indicating that important
archives were being evacuated.
Russian armies attacking on an

800-mile front yesterday advanced
38 miles across the base of the Polish
corridor and captured the East Prus
sian fortress cities of Insterburg and
Allenstein, and struck the Nazi lines
in the southeastern tip of German
Silesia.
Five Soviet army groups, which
Berlin estimated at 3,500,000 men,
captured more than 1,750 towns and
settlements on the eleventh day of
the great winter olfensive.
Unconfirmed reports accredited to
the Berlin radio said that Adolf Hit
ler had gone to the eastern front to
assume personal command and Swe
dish newspaper dispatches reaching
the OVVI said the Germans were
building defenses outside Berlin.
