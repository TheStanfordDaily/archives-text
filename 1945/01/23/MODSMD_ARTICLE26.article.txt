# New Teams Enter Cage-Play Tonite
## 
### 
The entrance of six new Army
teams into (he intramural basketball
league throws an element of mystery
into the third round of play tonight
as the new squads attempt to win
their spurs against the more "ex
perienced" teams which have already
played two rounds. Previous sched
ules have had to be abandoned, with
the result that all but five of the
original quintets in the league are
booked for tilts with the unknown
Army outfits tonight.
Addition of the new teams brings
10 17 the total of eage squads in the
league. Under the new schedules,
there will be eight games per night;
two each in the Pavilion and Encina
gyms at 7:15 and two in each again
at 8:15. There will be one bye each
time.
Tonight's card finds Gerona, Chi
nese Club, the Meds, Buchanan, the
Phi Psi's, and Tyler, all booked for
games with the Army teams, which
have chosen some original names for
themselves. These teams are, listed
in the same order as their opponents
above, the Strangers, the Cougars,
the Grizzlies, the Oilers, the Clubs,
and the Royal Flush.
In the two all-civilian battles of
the evening, the red hot Phi Psi's
face the Legal Eagles while the two
Arguello outfits, the Cards and the
Whites, both winless, fight it out for
•he cellar championship.
The Betas have another bye.
