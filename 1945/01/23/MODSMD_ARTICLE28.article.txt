### GORDON LEVY 
. . . This Is a Story of Loyalty . . .
This little episode concerns a dar
ing band of 25 loyal supporters who
set out for nearby Redwood City last
Friday night, with only their cause
to keep them happy. They were
planning to watch Dave Brown's
Palo Alto Independents get slaugh
tered by the powerful San Bruno
Navy cage squad, but at least they
wanted to say that they watched.
The expectations of these support
ers were coming true to form, re
gardless of all the efforts of 25 cheer
ing throats. The Palo Altans were 18
points behind with only ten minutes
remaining for the Navy It) enlarge
the score. Then the reward for loy
alty broke loose. Ed Douglas, Mor
ley Thompson, Dave Brown. Jack
Heald, and Bob Rowe exploded all
over the place with an incredible
flurry of points that gave the Palo
Altans a 44-43 victory over one of
the Bay's top teams.
Those 24 pair of eyes witnessed
what may not be witnessed again on
any basketball floor for many a
moon â€”a team scoring 28 points in
less than ten minutes. Spectators
and coaches alike agreed that this
was one of the most sensational fin
ishes in their hazy memories, bar
none. That band of loyal rooters
were far from disappointed with
their actions. That, friends, is our
story of the week!
Colorful Game
No one could be disappointed with
the turnout at Paly High Saturday
night for the Independent-Anton's
game which made us think of the old
days when gyms used to rock with
screaming voices. The Palo Altans, a
little worse for wear, showed that
they rank right up there with any
other squad of the same caliber.
An interesting feature was the
personal duel between Auten's Norm
Keeler and PAl's Morley Thompson,
with Thompson scoring 14 points
against Keeler's 13. Keeler was all-
PAL choice two years straight, while
Thompson was all-S.F. center for
the same number of years. In their
first meeting, this writer would ven
ture to say that Thompson outclassed
the Paly flash with his work on the
offensive backboard and aggressive
ball-handling.
Hitting the High Spots
San Bruno shouldered expenses
for the gym and officials in Redwood
Friday night just to give the Inde
pendents a chaice to play the game
. . . Dave Brown's wife gives the
team some moral support, acting as
'official scorekeeper" . . . we get
quite a kick out of those yellow jer
seys that Bobby Rosburg purchased
for the. team; at least no other team
will be wearing the same colors . . .
there just couldn't be any other
squad with the same taste for yellow.
