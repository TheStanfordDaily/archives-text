# Books deeded By Army, Navy
## 
### 
Stanford students have been asked
to contribute at least G5O books this
week to the Service Library, an or
ganization which supplies books and
magazines to the Army and Navy
posts in the South Pacific area.
The Stanford Bookstore has agreed
to act as a collection agency and all
books and recent magazines may be
left there.
One of the requests is for a library
of books to be taken to a Pacific
outpost by a group of young men,
most of whom are college graduates.
They have especially requested
biographies and current fiction. A
minimum of mysteries is desired.
The other request is for a large
number wf books to serve as a foun
dation for a library at one of the
most important harbors in the South
Pacific. This harbor is also a port
of call for our Allies: Dutch, French,
and Norwegian.
Books written in these languages
will be appreciated by those officers
and seamen who have not had a
chance to enjoy their native litera
ture for many years.
Funds are needed for the purchase
of magazines and new books: checks
may be sent to the Service Library,
Bryant Street and Hamilton Avenue.
