PARIS, Tuesday, Jan. 2?> (U.R) -
American flyers wrecked or dam
aged more than 4,000 enemy vehicles
fleeing the Ardennes bulge Monday
in the greatest aerial blow of the
war against a retreating army — a
blow that assumed catastrophic pro
portions for Marshal Karl Gerd von
Rundstedt's legions as they tried
desperately to fall back to the Scig
fried line.
Offsetting this probable Allied big
gest victory of the Ardennes cam
paign was a German report—uncon
firmed from Allied sources—that the
Wehrmacht had scored a new break
through up Northern Alsace, pierc
ing the Maginot line on a 25-mile
front and recapturing Hagenau.
