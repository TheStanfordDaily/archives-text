# Farm Flyers Meet Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford flying enthusiasts are in
vited to meet at the Nitery tonight
at 7:30 to begin organization of a
club which will make plans for the
purchase of a plane.
The meeting tonight is not that of
the Stanford Flying Club, however,
said Ray Elsmore, who is planning
tonight's meet.
Norma Trevorrow will announce
the first meeting of the Stanford
Flying Club as soon as its organiza
tion has been passed by the faculty.
The reason for these plans is that
the ban on coastal flying is expected
to be lifted before the end of this
month and would make flight in
struction again possible.
