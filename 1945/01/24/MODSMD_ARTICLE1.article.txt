en's Council and Conference. More
over, only Freshmen may vote for
the Freshmen Class officers.
Students are especially reminded
to present their student body cards
at the election booths, otherwise they
cannot be considered eligible to vote

with those problems affecting the
entire women student body, and its
officers legislate the social regula
tions which are enforced by the
members of Women's Council.
