# A 						CIVILIZED GERMANY
## 
### 
Miss Dorothy Thompson, in one of her recent
columns, has said some things about universi
ties that are of profound significance to us as
university people, and we write this with the
feeling that Miss Thompson's column should
not go by unobserved by our own press here
at Stanford.
The columfi in guestion is Miss Thompson's
second of a series on "Freedom for Germans."
As one of three general problems, she discusses
the role of the university in building a postwar
Germany. Our purpose is not to enter into the
guestion of the future of Germany per se, but
rather to acknowledge the significance of Miss
Thompson's opinion of the role of the univer
sity today and tomorrow.
* Miss Thompson points out that once Nazi
terrorism and bureaucracy are liguidated there
will be the utmost need to create "a new confi
dence around a new idea." She discusses the
problem under three main heads: First, to
maintain a production and distribution system;
second, to establish confidence-inspiring courts;
and . . . "third, and most important in the long
run, is education—the re-establishment of pri
mary, secondary and university education in
harmony with civilized standards. For that we
shall need an education commission."
She argues that . . . "we can draw some thou
sands of anti-Nazi scholars (for these commis
sions). Hundreds of them are in the United
States; others are in Britain, Switzerland and
Turkey. Commissions of these scholars could
go into every German university and find out
who is reliable.
"These, combined with Americans from the
Germanic faculties of our own universities, are
the only persons who can conceivably do this.
"As we see it, a civilized Germany can only
be created from the universities, which in many
of the faculties will prove to have held to civil
ized standards through all these terrible 12
years (italics ours).
"There the tradition is deepest. Through
generations before Hitler, no universities were
more dedicated to freedom of thought and
search after truth than were those in Germany."
These opinions of Dorothy Thompson should
be of more than mere academic interest to
Stanford University. Regardless of whether we
agree or disagree with Miss Thompson's gen
eral views about the future of Germany, we
should not overlook the significance of her
statements about the place of the university in
the postwar world.
This expression of a public opinion which
conceives the university to be a constructive
and dynamically effective force in society
should, we believe, provoke comment on this
campus. The Stanford Daily would like to give
expression to the opinions and convictions of
the members of its administration, faculty and
student body on this matter — a matter most
/i/ai to the postwar university and the postwar
world. — Ray Wissler.

Miss Dorothy Thompson, in one of her recent
columns, has said some things about universi
ties that are of profound significance to us as
university people, and we write this with the
feeling that Miss Thompson's column should
not go by unobserved by our own press here
at Stanford.
The columfi in guestion is Miss Thompson's
second of a series on "Freedom for Germans."
As one of three general problems, she discusses
the role of the university in building a postwar
Germany. Our purpose is not to enter into the
guestion of the future of Germany per se, but
rather to acknowledge the significance of Miss
Thompson's opinion of the role of the univer
sity today and tomorrow.
* Miss Thompson points out that once Nazi
terrorism and bureaucracy are liguidated there
will be the utmost need to create "a new confi
dence around a new idea." She discusses the
problem under three main heads: First, to
maintain a production and distribution system;
second, to establish confidence-inspiring courts;
and . . . "third, and most important in the long
run, is education—the re-establishment of pri
mary, secondary and university education in
harmony with civilized standards. For that we
shall need an education commission."
She argues that . . . "we can draw some thou
sands of anti-Nazi scholars (for these commis
sions). Hundreds of them are in the United
States; others are in Britain, Switzerland and
Turkey. Commissions of these scholars could
go into every German university and find out
who is reliable.
"These, combined with Americans from the
Germanic faculties of our own universities, are
the only persons who can conceivably do this.
"As we see it, a civilized Germany can only
be created from the universities, which in many
of the faculties will prove to have held to civil
ized standards through all these terrible 12
years (italics ours).
"There the tradition is deepest. Through
generations before Hitler, no universities were
more dedicated to freedom of thought and
search after truth than were those in Germany."
These opinions of Dorothy Thompson should
be of more than mere academic interest to
Stanford University. Regardless of whether we
agree or disagree with Miss Thompson's gen
eral views about the future of Germany, we
should not overlook the significance of her
statements about the place of the university in
the postwar world.
This expression of a public opinion which
conceives the university to be a constructive
and dynamically effective force in society
should, we believe, provoke comment on this
campus. The Stanford Daily would like to give
expression to the opinions and convictions of
the members of its administration, faculty and
student body on this matter — a matter most
/i/ai to the postwar university and the postwar
world. — Ray Wissler.
