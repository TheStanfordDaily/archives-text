A clatter of hooves, a roar of six-shooters, a ring
ing "to the rescue," as the latest group to be organized
on campus sweeps into the new season on the bi
monthly battle with blindness, the "Wardlaw Winners,"
inaugurating a new quarter in this little series.
The special little bit of entertainment which is ex
pected to take the place of "Kit Carson," and "In Dark
est Africa," is called "The Phantom Empire," starring
that man with the golden voice, the heart of steel, bul
lets of silver, and lead in his—no, on second thought,
he couldn't have, for he keeps jumping on and off of
his horse, much in the same manner of Kit and his
little Indian buddy, who had such a tough time with
the English A exam, and since this is true if his pants
were he would be too heavy to make those death
defying leaps. Gene Autrey. (Whew; finally got to it!)
The little gnomes (thanks, Sig) who play the juve
nile leads in the opus are SO good. Now that they
are 45 they can look back on their childhood careers
and think of what fun they had wearing the old wash
bucket on their heads and one of mother's favorite
curtains draped over their shoulders, as the Junior
Thunder Riders ride to the rescue.
This Junior Thunder Riders Club has taken the cam
pus by storm and in every house students are busily
engaged in destroying university property, in order
to make the necessary equipment to be full-fledged
members, as frustrated house managers moan about
the walls and curtains and all of the waste baskets
which are disappearing with monotonous regularity.
You, too. can become a member. All you have to do
is promise to aid someone in distress (there are plenty
of people on campus who are) and have a loud voice
as well as the aforementioned bucket, helmet, and
cloak.
Fortunately, the lights (boy. what a joker) are worse
in the first part of the "Winners," and one does not
have to struggle through as clear a picture of the serial,
but in the struggle for sight in the old audit would
really be nice to see the characters without having a
huge guessing contest as to what character is doing
what.
Crowning part is the little notice about the presence
of the 40 m.m. machine and the timing at which it is
flashed on is a masterpiece.
In fact, about the only time it happens is when the
frustrated hero is about to gain the upper hand, and
this little bit of devil's literature flashes across the
darkness to completely refrustrate a frustrated au
dience.
The audible sigh as his brawny arms (the hero, of
course and not some freshman in the back row) en
velope the heroine sweeps across the aud like a waving
sea of malt and then absolutely nothing, as the 40-
second pause for rewinding (or whatever they do)
goes on,
If Belt's was any closer, I might suspect the pro
jectionist of a tremendous thirst.
However, in spite of all of the frailties of the equip
ment. the "Wardlaw Dimmers" have made an auspi
cious start and even it Christmas is past, the Santa
Claus ending was teirific (you should sc»e my new
suit- only 11 more months to wait).

inaugurating a new quarter in this little series.
The special little bit of entertainment which is ex
pected to take the place of "Kit Carson," and "In Dark
est Africa," is called "The Phantom Empire," starring
that man with the golden voice, the heart of steel, bul
lets of silver, and lead in his—no, on second thought,
he couldn't have, for he keeps jumping on and off of
his horse, much in the same manner of Kit and his
little Indian buddy, who had such a tough time with
the English A exam, and since this is true if his pants
were he would be too heavy to make those death
defying leaps. Gene Autrey. (Whew; finally got to it!)
The little gnomes (thanks, Sig) who play the juve
nile leads in the opus are SO good. Now that they
are 45 they can look back on their childhood careers
and think of what fun they had wearing the old wash
bucket on their heads and one of mother's favorite
curtains draped over their shoulders, as the Junior
Thunder Riders ride to the rescue.
This Junior Thunder Riders Club has taken the cam
pus by storm and in every house students are busily
engaged in destroying university property, in order
to make the necessary equipment to be full-fledged
members, as frustrated house managers moan about
the walls and curtains and all of the waste baskets
which are disappearing with monotonous regularity.
You, too. can become a member. All you have to do
is promise to aid someone in distress (there are plenty
of people on campus who are) and have a loud voice
as well as the aforementioned bucket, helmet, and
cloak.
Fortunately, the lights (boy. what a joker) are worse
in the first part of the "Winners," and one does not
have to struggle through as clear a picture of the serial,
but in the struggle for sight in the old audit would
really be nice to see the characters without having a
huge guessing contest as to what character is doing
what.
Crowning part is the little notice about the presence
of the 40 m.m. machine and the timing at which it is
flashed on is a masterpiece.
In fact, about the only time it happens is when the
frustrated hero is about to gain the upper hand, and
this little bit of devil's literature flashes across the
darkness to completely refrustrate a frustrated au
dience.
The audible sigh as his brawny arms (the hero, of
course and not some freshman in the back row) en
velope the heroine sweeps across the aud like a waving
sea of malt and then absolutely nothing, as the 40-
second pause for rewinding (or whatever they do)
goes on,
If Belt's was any closer, I might suspect the pro
jectionist of a tremendous thirst.
However, in spite of all of the frailties of the equip
ment. the "Wardlaw Dimmers" have made an auspi
cious start and even it Christmas is past, the Santa
Claus ending was teirific (you should sc»e my new
suit- only 11 more months to wait).
A clatter of hooves, a roar of six-shooters, a ring
ing "to the rescue," as the latest group to be organized
on campus sweeps into the new season on the bi
monthly battle with blindness, the "Wardlaw Winners,"
inaugurating a new quarter in this little series.
