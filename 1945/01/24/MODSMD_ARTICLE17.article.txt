# Cougars Beat Chinese Club
## 
### ;VIQRT COHEN 
Continuing the intramural parade
with the usual vim, vigor, and up- i
sets, the boys of Stanford have again ;
shown their worth in basketball, as I
Med. 11, Buchanan, Cougars, and ,
Gerona emerged victorious in their
evening encounters.
Probably the top game of the eve- ;
ning was played by the Cougars, a :
newly formed Army team, and the
Chinese Club, previously undefeat
ed. With the shopting of Woo and
Prescott of the Cougars, the Chinese ;
Club didn't have a chance, as they j
took the long end of a 28-15 score.
\\oo was high with IG.
Buchanan Wins
With Bob Pitsker and Frank Hoff- ,
man scoring 16 and 14 points, respec
tively, the Buchanan Bearcats :
spanked the Oilers, 42-17. In the j
first half, Buchanan was hot and j
took a very good lead, but the Oilers J
came back beautifully and had the
Bearcats bottled up until midway in j
the second half, when they again
went on a scoring spree.
The Strangers, although they j
scored 18 points in the last few
minutes of play, still could not take '
Gerona, as Parker Riechie went all
out with 21 points. Modestly, Riechie
stated that he was lucky, but nobody
else would attest to that fact.
Med. II Again
Med. 11, with Corley again paving
the way, dumped the Grizzlies, 25-11.
The game was close all the way.
