# 'World Power For U.S.'-Wells
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
In startling contradiction to the
majority of Tuesday Series speakers
of the last two or three years, Car
veth Wells, noted engineer, explorer,
author and lecturer, came out last
night for what would constitute a
United States policy of world rule
in the postwar years.
Under the topic of "East and West
ot Suez," Mr. Wells said that the
United States would have a choice
either joining an effective world
League of Nations which ought to
follow the principle of majority rule,
or of going "her own sweet way."
Mr. Wells said he personally hoped
the United States would "choose the
latter course, and take the place of
the British Empire" through her
possession of the largest navy in the
world.
Mr. Wells gave himself personal
credit for having contributed to the
fall of Singapore, having been sent
to Malaya in 1918 by the British
government to supervise the build
ing of a railroad through the Malay
States. This railroad, he said, was
the main thing that ultimately al
lowed the Japanese to penetrate the
dense jungles of Malaya and strike
at the undefended back door of
Singapore.
He touched briefly on the political
lives of China and India, defending
both Chiang Kai-Shek's policy of
non-cooperation with the Chinese
Communist guerrilla fighters—"if he
were to supply them with arma
ments, he knows they would take
over the government"—and Britain's
position in India by pointing out the
tremendous differences in the lan
guages, religions, and political ideas
of India's 390 million people. He sar
castically flayed the leaders of In
dia's move for independence, saying
that Indians are as politically free
as the American people.
