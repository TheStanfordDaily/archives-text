ANNIE ARMSTRONG—Junior, vice-president of
Casa Eucalypto, Daily Business Staff and Quad work.
I feel that it is a privilege to live under our Honor
Code here and a ijreater privilege to help in its func
tioning.

I offer you my enthusiasm for this work and my
sense of its meaning to Stanford.

SYLVIA DAVIS-—I feel that from my participation
in the YWCA and sponsoring, I have gained much ex
perience that has better equipped me to become a
member of Women's Council.

.JOAN FULLINWIDER — Since I've been a Roble
sponsor for the oast three quarters and feel that I have
a good knowledge of the actions and policies of Wom
en's Council, if I am elected to a position on the Council
I will do all in my power to maintain the standards of
previous councils.

INEZ KERR—I have the time and interest and would
like to participate in the important work of Women's
Council. I worked on a similar post last summer at
Northwestern University.

MARY SUMNER—As Council representative from
my living group, I am familiar with the management
and responsibilities of Women's Council. If I am elected,
I will do my best to maintain the tradition and the
standards which Women's Council has upheld in the
past, and will strive to aid in the development of future
policies for Stanford women.

JEANNE WHISENAT —Through my work as a
Council representative from my living group, I have
become acquainted with the work of Women's Council.
With the recent increase in the number of Stanford
women, the capable functioning of this body has be
come extremely important. If elected, I shall attempt
to act in the best interests of the women students in
participating in this work.
