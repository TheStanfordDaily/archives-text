CRANE HONEYSETT—The present study of taw,
plus past experience, including two years in the Army
and one year with the War Manpower Commission,
will help me to understand better the questions and
problems that, may come to my attention as a member
of Men's Council. I also believe that I have sufficient
time to carry out the duties of this office.

FRIT/ KOENIG—In my opinion, it is the function of
Men's Council to insure fair play. To do this it. must
obtain all the facts before rendering a decision, and
it must discriminate between deliberate and accidental
violations of our rules and standards. Above all, it
must think for itself.

WAYNE STURGIS—More than three years at Stan
ford qualify Wayne Sturgis for Men's Council, not
only because of his familiarity with Farm traditions,
but also because of his judgment and impartiality.
Aiming to secure a greater respect and cooperation
with the Council by a better understanding of Stan
ford ideals, outstandingly suit him for the job.
