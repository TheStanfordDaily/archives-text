FOR PRESIDENT:
PAUL BERG—A s Freshmen we are a large and dis
organized group—but alert, intelligent, swell people
to know. I%m just another member of that class, per
haps a little taller, perhaps a little dumber. As your
president I would try to use my experience in debut
ing. publications, ROTC, orchestra and committee work
and as a campus house officer to develop an active,
well-organized Freshman Class.
DALE COVVGILL—The main problem of the Fresh
man Class is class unity. To achieve this aim we need
strong leadership and everybody's interest in coopera
tion in class activities.

WILLIE I)AVIES — Every class wishes to leave a
I good name with its Alma Mater. I am sure the class
iof "48" is no exception. Why don't we start aiming
for the goal during our Freshman year? We have the
! largest class in the school. Let's make it the best. IT
CAN BE DONE.

GORDON LEVY—Our Freshman Class—the largest
single body in Stanford today, has in its power a chance
to revive the traditional Stanford spirit in the light of
BOTH WAR AND STUDENT NEEDS. In my opinion,
this problem can be influenced by combining our ef
forts and promoting widespread activity participation
so that Stanford men returning from the battlefronts
will find the class of '48 carrying on the Stanford they
left behind.

MOIILEY THOMPSON—Our class of '48 has the op
portunity to lead in the promotion of campus spirit
and activities. It is my hope that I might be able to
aid '48 in a revival of the "Spirit of Stanford."

FOR SECRETARY

MARY ELLEN RICE—Now, when unity is so neces
sary, the class of '48 has the opportunity to elect their
officers. It will be through the sincere efforts of these
officers and the cooperation of their fellow classmen
that the desired unity will be attained. To this soli
darity I pledge my cooperation.

MARY STAFFORD — The class of '48 can have a
really big year in 1945! We're spread over the campus
—yes —but by sticking together we can make this year
one to remember! I'd like to try to help make this year
— and the class of '48 —the best.

MARY LESNETT—Because 1 have held offices in
| high school; because I have held positions here as
chairman of committees and am therefore familiar with
the functions of the ASSU, and because I have time to j
devote to the office, I feel that I am capable of being j
secretary of the Freshman Class.

EMILY ANGLE —I believe that the class of '48 has ;
the opportunity to take a more active part in student j
government than has heretofore been'given any Fresh- j
man Class and, through efficient organization, to be- j
come an influential part of the student body. If elect- j
ed, I will do my utmost to further these aims by co
operating with the class president.

CAROL HULL—I consider it a privilege to be nomi- j
nated by Casa Ventura as a write-in candidate for the j
ofiiee of secretary of the Freshman Class, and would j
be very happy to serve Stanford's largest class in this
capacity.
Our Freshman spirit has already amazed the other j
classes, and I feel that with unity we can establish !
ourselves as the most outstanding group to enter Stan
ford under the strain of war.

ILLII'I COSTIGAN—I appreciate very much the op
portunity to run for secretary oL the Freshman Class.
Because I have had previous experience along this line
and have extra time this term, I feel that by doing' my
best I would be able to capably carry out the responsi
bilities of this office.

nated by Casa Ventura as a write-in candidate for the j
ofiiee of secretary of the Freshman Class, and would j
be very happy to serve Stanford's largest class in this
capacity.
Our Freshman spirit has already amazed the other j
classes, and I feel that with unity we can establish !
ourselves as the most outstanding group to enter Stan
ford under the strain of war.

ILLII'I COSTIGAN—I appreciate very much the op
portunity to run for secretary oL the Freshman Class.
Because I have had previous experience along this line
and have extra time this term, I feel that by doing' my
best I would be able to capably carry out the responsi
bilities of this office.
FOR PRESIDENT:
PAUL BERG—A s Freshmen we are a large and dis
organized group—but alert, intelligent, swell people
to know. I%m just another member of that class, per
haps a little taller, perhaps a little dumber. As your
president I would try to use my experience in debut
ing. publications, ROTC, orchestra and committee work
and as a campus house officer to develop an active,
well-organized Freshman Class.
DALE COVVGILL—The main problem of the Fresh
man Class is class unity. To achieve this aim we need
strong leadership and everybody's interest in coopera
tion in class activities.

WILLIE I)AVIES — Every class wishes to leave a
I good name with its Alma Mater. I am sure the class
iof "48" is no exception. Why don't we start aiming
for the goal during our Freshman year? We have the
! largest class in the school. Let's make it the best. IT
CAN BE DONE.

GORDON LEVY—Our Freshman Class—the largest
single body in Stanford today, has in its power a chance
to revive the traditional Stanford spirit in the light of
BOTH WAR AND STUDENT NEEDS. In my opinion,
this problem can be influenced by combining our ef
forts and promoting widespread activity participation
so that Stanford men returning from the battlefronts
will find the class of '48 carrying on the Stanford they
left behind.

MOIILEY THOMPSON—Our class of '48 has the op
portunity to lead in the promotion of campus spirit
and activities. It is my hope that I might be able to
aid '48 in a revival of the "Spirit of Stanford."

FOR SECRETARY

MARY ELLEN RICE—Now, when unity is so neces
sary, the class of '48 has the opportunity to elect their
officers. It will be through the sincere efforts of these
officers and the cooperation of their fellow classmen
that the desired unity will be attained. To this soli
darity I pledge my cooperation.

MARY STAFFORD — The class of '48 can have a
really big year in 1945! We're spread over the campus
—yes —but by sticking together we can make this year
one to remember! I'd like to try to help make this year
— and the class of '48 —the best.

MARY LESNETT—Because 1 have held offices in
| high school; because I have held positions here as
chairman of committees and am therefore familiar with
the functions of the ASSU, and because I have time to j
devote to the office, I feel that I am capable of being j
secretary of the Freshman Class.

EMILY ANGLE —I believe that the class of '48 has ;
the opportunity to take a more active part in student j
government than has heretofore been'given any Fresh- j
man Class and, through efficient organization, to be- j
come an influential part of the student body. If elect- j
ed, I will do my utmost to further these aims by co
operating with the class president.

CAROL HULL—I consider it a privilege to be nomi- j
nated by Casa Ventura as a write-in candidate for the j
ofiiee of secretary of the Freshman Class, and would j
