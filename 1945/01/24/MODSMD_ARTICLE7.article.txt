# Freshman Offices

FOR PRESIDENT:
PAUL BERG—A s Freshmen we are a large and dis
organized group—but alert, intelligent, swell people
to know. I%m just another member of that class, per
haps a little taller, perhaps a little dumber. As your
president I would try to use my experience in debut
ing. publications, ROTC, orchestra and committee work
and as a campus house officer to develop an active,
well-organized Freshman Class.
