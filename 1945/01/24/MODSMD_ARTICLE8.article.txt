# Card Sharks Sign Up Today
## 
### 
This is it —the last day in which
Farm men and women may enter
the Cardinals bridge tournament.
Students who have been practicing
their skills to alleviate the pain of
a lock-in or to postpone the inev
itable study-time, have at last a
higher goal toward which to aim—
bonds for the winning partnership,
Roos Brothers gifts for the runners
up ,and a booby prize, as yet un
named, for the team whose score
from the very beginning of the tour
nament is lowest.
Drawings for opponents will be
held in the Nitery at 4:30 tomorrow
afternoon, with Cardinals president,
Dick Fayram, officiating. Entries
must be in today at 3 p.m.—in the
boxes on History Corner or at the
Cellar.


DICK FAYRAM, Cardinals President
