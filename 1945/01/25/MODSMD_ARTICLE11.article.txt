## 
### 
With plans for the Soph Cotillion's
"Showboat" sailing smoothly along
comes the announcement from ticket
chairman Nancy Norton that bids are
now at the printer's, and will cost $3
a couple. They are not expected to
be ready for sale, however, until
shortly before the dance, according
to Miss Norton.
Benny Glassman and his orches
tra, who will furnish the music for
Toyon's dance, have been tentatively
procured to make with the tunes for
the "Showboat" on the night of
February 10. The dance will be held
iu the basketball Pavilion, and will
last from 9 to 1.
Stanfordites anxious to have their
pic appear in the Quad will arrive
at the dance in best formals or tux,
according to the chairmen, for Quad
photographers will be on hand to re
cord the event for the 1945 issue of
that publication.
