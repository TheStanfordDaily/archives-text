JAPANESE INTOLERANCE
As Western papers scream with articles
headed "Nisei intimidation" much tongue
chucking goes on around campus because, of
course, we know that racial intolerance is a
low form of life. It may be noted also that it
is a hard way of life and in those areas where
it occurs there are harsh economic frictions
that provide its basis rather than simple rea
sons of misguided patriotism.
To have some idea of the reality of racial
intolerance we have to realize that we have
not, and probably never will have, direct con
tact with its sources. We cannot therefore be
excused from its practice for merely "being"
tolerant, broadminded and tongue-chucking.
What we will do when we leave college is
manage businesses, teach other Americans,
write, talk, and influence some people. We
must be equipped with sound reasons for es
tablishing the conviction that Americans can
believe in America and be assured that its
doctrines of equality are the sanest rules to
live by.
We must know the realities that face people
who turn to placing sticks of dynamite in their
neighbor's barns. They need wisdom and un
derstanding, not righteous indignation, to be
lieve that there are alternatives which will
achieve their most far-sighted ends.
Let us make sure that while we are in a
position to be aloof from the turmoil, we are
gaining the equipment in ideas and knowledge
to do something about it in our future vocations
or avocations.
