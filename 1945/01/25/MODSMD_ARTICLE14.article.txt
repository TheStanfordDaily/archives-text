### Walrus the Carpenter 
(These are excerpts from the Memoirs
of John Bell, forty-second President of the
United States, published in 2000 A.D.)
During the war years the Stanford fraternities
had been turned into University dormitories,
each one in charge of an older student or
younger faculty member, under the control of
the Dean of Men.
It was my good fortune to be assigned to
Dne known as Tyler Hall, the name derived from
some obscure Western character, I believe, who
was instrumental in establishing the first cable
rars in San Francisco.
The temporary disappearance of these fra
einities was an excellent thing for the stu
ients. A more serious purpose, befitting the
period of wartime effort and strain, was thereby
infused into the student life. The presence of
he residont assistant afforded a contact with
i more mature mind and inculcated a spirit of
nutual help and consideration in the dormi
ories.
There were, of course, some exceptions. The
person in charge of Tyler was an Englishman
named Scott, or Ross, or Smith; let us call him

Smith. This Smith set himself up as a petty
tyrant. He regarded American students as "a
lesser breed without the law," and put into
practice the training that every Englishman
appears to have received in colonial adminis
tration.
British colonial policy has been, and still is,
extremely effective. It is composed in a large
measure of bland assurances, high-sounding
promises and politely expressed regrets. No
body can find a fault with its manner, unless
it is an unconscious assumption of superiority
that no Englishman is ever able to lose. Despite
its smugness this last guality is so native to
the English character that it has to be over
looked, as one overlooks the deformities that
certain African tribes practice on themselves.
What the average American finds so intoler
able is the essentially autocratic aspect of this
personality.
Smith had these British gualities to a high
degree. When he wished his own way, and he
would tolerate no other way, his initial method
was a series of apparently sound arguments —
the appeal to reason. If the students remained
stubborn he would blandly promise some favor
that he had no intention of providing—the
appeal to cupidity.
If he still met hostility Smith expressed sur
prise so exguisitely well-bred and reasonable
that his interlocutor felt like an uncouth boor
who had forgotten to touch his cap to the pil
lage sguire. Smith's final appeal, regretfully
but firmly urged, was to force. The authority
of the Univesrity was invoked and opposition
was either at an end or summarily dealt with.
In this way Tyler Hall v/as conducted like
an English boys' school, a very surprising oc
currence in an American University. Quiet was
strictly enforced. Lights were turned out at
10:30. The highway and even Palo Alto were
"out of bounds." At 7:00 a.m. Smith came
around and turned every student out of bed,
whether he liked it or not, in order to get break
fast ancT make an eight o'clock class. If the
student had no eight o'clock classes he got
his breakfast anyway.
