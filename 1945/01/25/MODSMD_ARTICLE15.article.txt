Volcanic occurrences 011 the Eastern Front have so
I far kept down the attention to the action 011 Luzon,
j Our main progress so far is south from Lingayen Gulf,
I but not north.
The proper line of defense for the island should be
j somewhere in the rugged north country. By using the
i port of Aparri, 011 the northern tip. as a base, the enemy
I army could Keep in touch with Formosa and should
have somewhat of a chance of being able to evacuate
to that point.
General Mac Arthur, however, tried to draw him
south by taking the islands of Samar and Mindoro,
bases for an invasion of the southern plain. Heathen
swung around to the north and landed at Lingayen
Gulf, placing himself between the plain and the north
ern end of the island.
The question now is, did his plan work? We know
that Lingayen Gulf was not defended, and if he caught
the enemy by surprise, then he has either split their
army or else has bottled it up in the south.
However, the Japanese tacticians made a wise de
cision when they adopted their apparent policy of not
disputing attempts to establish a beachhead. A coun
terattack under these conditions might, indeed, catch
the invading force off balance, but it would have to
face the terrific and highly accurate fire of a naval
flotilla's guns.
Kesselring, ;it the battle of Salerno, was defeated,
despite heavily superior striking power, because of this
1 factor. \
Then it is highly possible that the Japanese have
concentrated in the north, #nd deliberately will let us
take Manila with only light resistance.
Their abortive counterstroke into the northern flank
of our beachhead somewhat confirms this, since at its
time Mac Arthur's flying columns were moving rapidly
southward, and the enemy possibly hoped to catch u.s
with our forces divided and break up our northern
i wing before the southern could reinforce it.
However, the enemy, if he was caught by surprise,
I might have been trying to re-establish communications
with forces trapped in the south.
The net result of his offensive seems to have been
thai a lot of our strength has been drawn from the
mi' 1 ' and thrown into the north and the center. Our
fly in , columns thus could pot push forward too far.
Thus, the battle of Luzon might develop in the north
' in hills, and the quick way in which Mac Arthur shift
j ed hi> forces might have gotten him out of trouble. So
Â».ir, Manila will be left alone.
