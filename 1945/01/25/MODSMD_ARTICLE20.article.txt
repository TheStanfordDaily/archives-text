truly representative of student opin
ion, Excom last night, proposed i
reet contact with students and opin
ions before voting on vital mea
sures, through conference, inter-hall
council, .and early publication and
circulation of Excom agenda.
In order that students be better
acquainted with issues before Ex
com and better understand the func
tions of student government, it was
suggested that Excom members talk
informally with living-room groups
\nd stimulate, particularly amon<?
■he freshmen, greater attendance at
Excom meetings.
At President Barbara White's
suggestion, each Excom member
will submit on Wednesday a list of
15 names of students recommended
for committee heads, to guarantee
greater representation in student
activities.
Sally Breuner pointed out that
Women's Conference as it now func
tions channels information TO the
living groups, rather than receiving
complaints and suggestions FROM
them. It was suggested that 15 min
utes of each Conference meeting be
devoted to active discussion of issues
brought up by members or implied
in the Excom agenda.
Suggestion that Excom's organi
zation be revised—in the words of Ed
Luce, "Eight voting members cannot
possibly be representative of student
opinion" — will be discussed next
time.
In order that Excom come to
meetings better informed, agendas
will be circulated on Tuesday and
contact with student ideas encour
