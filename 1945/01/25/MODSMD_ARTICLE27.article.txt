### SERVET DURAN 
(Editor's note: The following is
a review of International Club
activities written for the Daily by
Servet Duran.)

How does life in European univer
sities compare with that of the
United States? One of the Club
members who has attended some
European universities answers the
question and leads the Club in a
lively discussion on the pros and
cons of foreign schools.
Many questions of this sort are
answered by the guest or speaker of
the evening, a professor or promi
nent authority on foreign affairs.
Thus, the I. Club carries on its pol
icy of bringing together American
and foreign students to discuss their
mutual problems and subjects of
interest to all.
Meets In Paly
The I. Club is composed of equal
numbers of foreign and American
students who meet every other Sun
day at the home of Mrs. Edwin J.
Thomas, 365 Lincoln Avenue in Palo
Alto. This homelike atmosphere is
appreciated especially by foreign
students who have not had the op
portunity to visit American homes.
The I. Club not only holds in
formal meetings but also encourages
the foreign students to participate in
campus social functions. The mem
bers have held dances, barbecues,
and parties, many of which were
open to all campus.
First Meeting Sunday
Sunday, January 28, at 7:30 p.m.
the club will hold its first get-to
gether of this quarter. Besides the
election of new officers, plans for the
barbecue to be held on February 11
wlil be discussed. The speaker of
the evening will be Dr. Eliot G.
Mears, professor of geography and
| international trade, and his talk will
be based on his experiences abroad.
The club has extended a special
invitation to the members of the
Klahoya Club, and again renews its
invitation to all students and faculty
members whether American or for
eign, to participate in all of its func
tions.
