# Frost Puzzle Explained; Better Weather Promised
## 
### LORRY I. LOKEY 
Several of the four or five regular readers of the weather forecasts in
the Daily have asked me why the temperature is recorded as above freez
ing when frost and even ice appear in the early mornings.
Well, benig a Portlander and a subscriber of the Oregonian, I will quote
the following from the Dec. 26, 1944, editorial page of that paper:

'"On a clear, comparatively still
night, with but little or no wind to
keep the air mixed, the ground loses
heat by radiation faster than does
the atmosphere.
"Under such conditions the tem
perature at the surface of the ground
may be several degrees lower than
the temperature a few feet above the
surface. A contributing factor, of
course, though not a determining
one in the instance, is that cold air
settles to the surface."
So, dear reader(s), there is your
answer. My thermometer, being
about twenty feet off the ground, is
just high enough to record the tem
perature a few degrees higher than
that of the ground.
Incidentally, these weather discus
sions are no relation to those of a
well-known San Francisco paper. It
so happens that they began in the
newspaper business before I did.
Minimum yesterday 37°
Maximum yesterday 55°
Barometer at 4. p.m 30.14 in.
Forecast: Overcast today, but warm
er this morning.
