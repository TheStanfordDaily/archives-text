# Roos Bros. Shack--All But a Mother To Shaggy Indians
## 
### ELAINE WOOD 
Do your sweaters have that baggy,
j worn-out look? Do they trip you up
| when you're dashing to classes? Do
! they unravel when you nervously
; pull that lonely piece of yarn? Are
; they moth-resistant? Unless you
can answer these questions in the
i affirmative, you'd better start re
plenishing your wardrobe right now.
Start at Shack
And where do you start this great
project? Why, at the Roos Brothers
Shack on campus, of course . For at
the shack you will find all sorts of
sports apparel for both men and
women, and it is conveniently lo
cated right next to the Bookstore.
Students may browse through the
shack any time from 10 a.m. to 5:30
p.m.
Look Rehi n (I Trees
This store has been on campus for
about a year—so even if you haven't
noticed the shack (which is partially
hidden by trees) you now know
where to find it.
Some time when on your way to a
10 o'clock class, drop in to the shack
and take stock—or if your budget
will allow it, buy the stock—of what
Roos Brothers has to offer you. For

you, too, can be a BMOC—or BWOC
as the case may be. You, too, can
wear those clothes that make people
stop dead in their tracks and say, "I
wonder who that was?"
Chatters Provided
Then, too, if you have time on
your hands, you can always drop
into the shack and chat with youi
friends who work there. Some ot
the girls who help out at the store
are Phyllis Sutherland, Elaine
Woodin (not to be mistaken with
another almost identical name), Pal;
Tapscott, and Charmian Kolar.
In the future, therefore, remem
ber—you don't have to venture all
the way into Palo Alto for that "'cer
tain something" that will make you
the life of the party. Instead, trip
over to Roos Brothers' shack and.
take your choice of the many stylet;
they have to offer.
