# Flying Club Plans To Purchase Plane
## 
### 
Stanford flying enthusiasts who
met Tuesday evening in the Nitery
and organized under the leadership
of Ray Elsmore, will take to the air
as soon as flying restrictions are re
laxed.
Of the 25 students who gathered
in the Nitery, 13 will form the actual
membership of the club, for which
the name "Lucky Thirteen" has been
suggested. Members will contribute
$200 apiece toward the purchase of
an Army surplus two-seater plane,
which, said Elsmore, can be obtained
from the Belmont Airport, where the
club is to have its headquarters..
Elsmore, a freshman from Salt
Lake City, who has 55 hours in the
air to his credit, expects the civilian
ban to be lifted by next month. Un
til then, the club will concentrate on
its organization and the buying of
the plane, which is to be used jointly.
If a sufficient number of students
show interest in the newly formed
club, a second plane may be pur
chased, concluded Elsmore.
