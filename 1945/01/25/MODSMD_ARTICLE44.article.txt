## 
### TED DRENTON 
Stanford students are the friendliest and healthiest I have ever met,''
declares Professor James A. Work, acting professor of English and new
member of the English department. A native of the Midwest, he has been
exceptionally impressed with the beauty of the Farm during winter and
has enjoyed the pleasant mildness of California weather.
"The scholarship and vitality of the English deportment here are out-

standing," he declares, expressing-*
particular enthusiasm for the reor
ganized English program instituted j
this quarter. Chaucer and the eight
eenth century novel are the fields of '
study which especially interest him
and' he is presenting courses in these |
subjects in the undergraduate and
graduate divisions of the English de
partment.
Likes Tennis, Music
The lighter side of his personality j
is evident in his hobbies of tennis 1
and record - collecting. American
folk-music, as well as medieval and
Renaissance music, are unusual fea- j
tures of his record collection.
He has spent several summers I
traveling in England and Europe.
He worked his way across the At
lantic in a cattle boat on one occa
sion, and traveled steerage in an
other. "I am a good sailor," he de
clares.
Attended Grinnell
Mr. Work received his A.B. from
Grinnell College in 1926, with majors
in speech and philosophy. As an un
dergraduate his chief extracurricu
lar interests were journalism and
public speaking, and he was elected
ot membership in Sigma Delta Chi,
national journalistic fraternity, and
Phi Beta Kappa, national honorary
scholastic organization.
His graduate work in English he
did at Yale University, where he
was Yale Scholar and Yale Fellow.
He instructed in public speaking at
Brown University and in English at I
Northwestern and Wayne Univer
sities. Last fall he began instructing
at Stanford.
