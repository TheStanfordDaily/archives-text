We were just looking at an article
about the University of California
basketball team and how they got
dumped by USC by some atrocious
score, and then we noticed a small
article, hidden away like all small
articles, about the Palo Alto Inde
pendents. It said something to the
effect that the Independents upset
a highly touted San Bruno Navy
five, 44-43. Those two articles set
us to thinking, and instead of wast
ing our time on the merits or de
merits of Einstein and F. D. R., we
decided to waste our time on a little
idle (?) speculation.
We followed-up the story on Cal
and noticed how they had started off
the season with one upset after an
other, and then how they cooled off
and didn't win a game in a long
time. The record of the Independ
ents seems to tell a completely dif
ferent story—a story of how a few
fellows got together and, after los
ing their initial encounter, steadily
improved until they became one of
the best teams in their league, or for
that matter, in anyone else's league.
Then our minds became active,
and we thought of how these two
teams would stack up against each
other, and which one was the belter.
We looked over Cal's squad and no
ticed that Gus Mota was the center,
the leader, the pacemaker of the
team. We noticed that as Mota went,
so went Cal; and we also noticed
that Mota had been stopped more
than once. But there are others on
the team. George Clyne, who is the
second leading scorer over in Berk
eley, is considered above average.
And then Jim Farrell, Bob Hoge
boom, and Jack Lerond, are also
around. All of these boys are tall
and rugged, but none of them is
spectacular.
And then we thought of Dave
Brown, Jack Heald, Morley Thomp
son, Ed Douglas, and George Bower.
We thought of the experience that
Brown and Heald could gather up
and display at any time, for they
are no novices to the game; both of
them played for Stanford and for
UCLA. While we were wandering
in their glory, a tall, black-haired
individual came to our minds, and
we decided that we couldn't fox-get
Thompson. Morley is just out of
high school, but he is rated as one
of the top players in the Bay Area.
He possesses a beautiful eye and is
terrific on rebounding. But think
ing of Thompson made us think of
Douglas, who scored 10 points in the
last few minutes of the San Bruno
game, and Bower, who has continued
to play steady ball.
Yes, a game between these two
teams would be pretty good. The
way it looks to us. Cal would con
tinue its losing streak. Can't you
just picture Dave Brown, Morley
Thompson and Co. smothering the
Blue and Gold? Can't you just pic
ture Jack Heald, who is potentially
the best player on the team, hitting
his stride and swishing through 20
points? Can't you just picture a
group of Stanford students getting
behind the Palo Alto Independents
and watching a team of their own
choosing beat the Blue and Gold of
Cal?

ture Jack Heald, who is potentially
the best player on the team, hitting
his stride and swishing through 20
points? Can't you just picture a
group of Stanford students getting
behind the Palo Alto Independents
and watching a team of their own
choosing beat the Blue and Gold of
Cal?
We were just looking at an article
about the University of California
basketball team and how they got
dumped by USC by some atrocious
score, and then we noticed a small
article, hidden away like all small
articles, about the Palo Alto Inde
pendents. It said something to the
effect that the Independents upset
a highly touted San Bruno Navy
five, 44-43. Those two articles set
us to thinking, and instead of wast
ing our time on the merits or de
merits of Einstein and F. D. R., we
decided to waste our time on a little
idle (?) speculation.
We followed-up the story on Cal
and noticed how they had started off
the season with one upset after an
other, and then how they cooled off
and didn't win a game in a long
time. The record of the Independ
ents seems to tell a completely dif
ferent story—a story of how a few
fellows got together and, after los
ing their initial encounter, steadily
improved until they became one of
the best teams in their league, or for
that matter, in anyone else's league.
Then our minds became active,
and we thought of how these two
teams would stack up against each
other, and which one was the belter.
We looked over Cal's squad and no
ticed that Gus Mota was the center,
the leader, the pacemaker of the
team. We noticed that as Mota went,
so went Cal; and we also noticed
that Mota had been stopped more
than once. But there are others on
the team. George Clyne, who is the
second leading scorer over in Berk
eley, is considered above average.
And then Jim Farrell, Bob Hoge
boom, and Jack Lerond, are also
around. All of these boys are tall
and rugged, but none of them is
spectacular.
And then we thought of Dave
Brown, Jack Heald, Morley Thomp
son, Ed Douglas, and George Bower.
We thought of the experience that
Brown and Heald could gather up
and display at any time, for they
are no novices to the game; both of
them played for Stanford and for
UCLA. While we were wandering
in their glory, a tall, black-haired
individual came to our minds, and
we decided that we couldn't fox-get
Thompson. Morley is just out of
high school, but he is rated as one
of the top players in the Bay Area.
He possesses a beautiful eye and is
terrific on rebounding. But think
ing of Thompson made us think of
Douglas, who scored 10 points in the
last few minutes of the San Bruno
game, and Bower, who has continued
to play steady ball.
Yes, a game between these two
teams would be pretty good. The
way it looks to us. Cal would con
tinue its losing streak. Can't you
just picture Dave Brown, Morley
Thompson and Co. smothering the
Blue and Gold? Can't you just pic
ture Jack Heald, who is potentially
the best player on the team, hitting
his stride and swishing through 20
points? Can't you just picture a
