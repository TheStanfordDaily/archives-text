# Gerona Meets Cougars In Intramurals Tonight
## 
### DICK JENNINGS 
Intramural basketball goes into its fourth round of play tonight with
a full card featuring two important contests a.s the Betas attempt to avenge
their previous defeat at the hands of sure-shooting Tyler and undefeated
Gerona A.C. comes to grips with the new Cougar quintet, the sparkling
army squad which humbled the strong Chinese Club Tuesday in its league
debut.
Beta is handicapped by the absence of stellar Morley Thompson, who

is unable to make the Thursday
nijiht games; it will be up to Douy
Tuck. Ric Supple, and Joe Sher to
prevent a repetition of last week's
tame,..when the Tyler-men squeezed
by to a 17-16 win, primarily due to
the work of Bob Slobe.
The Cougars boast a well-manned
team headed by Red Douâ€”oops!
Prescott, whose fine contributions in
both offense and defense might well
be enough to overthrow the Gerona
A.C. attack, which proved too much
for the Strangers last Tuesday.
Parker Riechie will be the Gerona
man to watch.
Another game that will undoubt
edly prove exciting will be the Med.
School II vs. Royal Flush. The Med
ics have come through their first
three games unscathed, but might
meet more than their match in the
Flushers, who are a hard-fighting,
aggressive army five.
Buchanan's Bearcats meet the
Strangers in an unpredictable game.
Both teams are potentially strong,
and Gumby's Bearcats show well
on a short course, as was evidenced
by their victory over the Oilers
Tuesday.
The Phi Psi's are favored over the
army Grizzles, who made a pitiful
showing against Med. 11. Arguello
Cardinals should also take the Oil
ers without much trouble, but the
Whites will probably be crushed by
the Legal Eagles. Sequoia Hall plays
the Cubs at 8:15. and the Chinese
Club is slated for a battle with Med.
I, a darkhorse team making its de
but tonight.
Coach Harry Wolters wishes to
warn the basketball enthusiasts that
rough playing will be clamped down
on in the games tonight. He also
announces that Co. C has formed six
teams to play Wednesday night in
their own league.
