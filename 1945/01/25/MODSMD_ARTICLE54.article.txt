# Fulton To Test Hagg In Mile
## 
### 
A challenge for someone to push
Sweden's great distance runner,
Gundar Hagg, to new heights in his
American indoor tour this winter
has not gone unheeded. Stanford's
great middle distance runner, John
ny Fulton, has decided to forego his
shorter races for a whack at the
mile event and Hagg.
In his first mile race in competi
tion when he ran against the same
Hagg in San Francsico back in 1942,
Fulton ate the Swede's cinders. But
Johnny claims that he may have
more experience and stamina now
than before. Fulton is now living in
New Rochelle, New York, working
out daily for his mile efforts, after
leaving Stanford a fortnight ago.
In his first trip East last winter,
Fulton took the Millrose 600 and
the Boston 1000-yard events in
stride. The Madison Square Gar
den season opens on February 3 with
the Millrose affair, at which Johnny
will make his 1945 debut.
Fulton thus will go into his mile
attempts with a three-year memory
to spur him on. Some people in the
East contend that it will be another
case of "Fulton's Folly," but Stan
ford supporters expect Fulton to
make good like his namesake Rob
ert, and race on to sensational vic
tories.
