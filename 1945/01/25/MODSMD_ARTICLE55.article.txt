# Dance Lessons For All Tonight In Clubhouse
## 
### 
Dancing lessons in the fox trot
and Viennese waltz will be given at
the second meeting of the Henry
Elsasser dance group tonight from
8:30 to 10:15 p.m. in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Elsasser is former director of a
dance studio in London. He will
concentrate and shorten tonight's
lesson in order that the student may
learn as much as possible in a short
time.
All students are invited.
