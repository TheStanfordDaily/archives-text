Harry Wolter, head Â«112 mural
sports, late yesterday indicated
that the present 17-team basket
ball league may he divided into
two separate leagues next week.
Each team would thus play one
game on a full court each week.
Wolter said that pleas from sev
eral of the teams have brought
about these new plans and that if
put into elTect all games played
thus far would he counted as
merely practice contests.
Teams with objections to the
new |iiaii should tile their com

games.
