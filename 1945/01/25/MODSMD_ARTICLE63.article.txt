# Russian Army Troops Capture Oppeln, Oder River Fortress
## 
### 
LONDON. Jan. 25 (U.R)—Red army
tanks and infantry yesterday cap
tured the prize Oder river fortress
city of Oppeln, capital of Upper
Silesia, and smashed to within four
miles of panic-stricken Breslau,
chief industrial city of eastern Ger
many.
Soviet forces were fighting in the
streets of the Silesian mining city

of Gleiwitz, Berlin said, and the at
tack on East Prussia and its capital
city of Konigsberg was increased by
another . Red army drive that re
portedly has narrowed the escape
corridor to about 20 miles for some
200.000 Nazi troops.
In Poland, Russian armies won the
fortress cities of Kalisz and Rawicz,
the latter only 148 miles southeast
of Berlin and the closest approach to
the German capital announced by
the Soviet high command. But Ber
lin said Poznan was under siege
from the east and south and Poznan
is only 136 miles east of the Nazi
capital.
All the coal and steel areas of
Silesia were threatened with envel
opment by the swift Soviet advances
into the "'Ruhr of the East." Berlin
said the Russians already had
crossed the frozen Oder river north
and south of captured Oppeln.
Breslau, eighth city of Germany,
with a population of 615,000 persons,
and largest German city yet im
periled by an Allied army, was in
imminent danger of capture. Out-
Hanked on the northwest, its main
communications with Berlin cut, it
was approached last night by Soviet
spearheads which captured Marga
reth, on the east bank of the river,
and only a few miles away.
Berlin broadcasts said Adolf Hit
ler ordered the city defended to the
last man and all males 10 to 00
drafted into the home guard.
Moscow's nightly communique an
nounced that the Red Army forces
had driven to with 44 miles north
east of the free city of Danzig,
capturing Reisenburg.
