PARIS, Thursday, Jan. 25 (U.R> —
Hritish Second Army troops, reach
ing ten miles in.side the Reich,
stormed into the Siegfreid fortress
ol' Heinsburg Tliursday against thin
ning enemy resistance, and it was
disclosed that for three days Ger
man railroads had been jammed
with men and weapons shifting from
the west to the eastern front.
At Heinsburg, Field Marshal B. L
Montgomery's Tommies were withir 4
15 miles of the twin Rhineland in
dustrial centers of Munchen-Glad
bach and Rheydt— extreme artillery
range—and were j List 29 miles from
the metropolis of Dusseldorf on the
Rhine.
Desperate to hold the west wall
while their eastern ramparts were
cracking, the Germans fought back
hard against Montgomery's spear
head. The effective house-to-house
resistance which characterized the
battle of Aachen was missing as the
British advanced as much as four
miles across "wholly German" soil.
Fighter bombers of the Second
Tactical Air Force attached to Mont
gomery s 21st Army Groups, have
since Monday been pounding Ger
man troop trains traveling eastward
to Hanover, junction point of the
railways to Berlin.
First and Third Army troops
socked out gains from one to three
miles from the base of the punctured
Ardennes bulge on a 35-mile front,
meeting resistance mostly from Ger
man rearguards stranded near the
German frontier by the Ninth Tac
tical Air Force's record onslaught
Monday and Tuesday.
Field Marshal Karl Gerd von
Runstedt tried to erect a buffer line
along the Klerf river in northeast
ern Luxembourg against the hard
charging U. S. Third Army and sent
his troops into four fruitless coun
terattacks against the First Army in
St. Vith. northern anchor post of
