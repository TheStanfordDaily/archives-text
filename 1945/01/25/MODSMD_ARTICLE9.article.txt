# Bandage Rollers I've Seen: A Psycho-illogical Study
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
No one, not even a wound, appre
ciates the personality of a bandage.
It's just a hunk of gauze to everyone
but the creator. To her the bandage
is packed with emotion ranging from
purple passion to a deep parental
loathing, depending, of course, upon
the temperament of the creator.
Bandage room type No. 1 is of
the Nightingale speries. She ar
rives at the scene of action with
her "Tiny Tot Nursing Kit" tucked
underneath her arm and grabs the
only outfit not labeled "Los An
geles Gunny Sack Corporation."
She's the type who regards roll
ing bandages as American wom
en s l>eautifiil sacrifice, and sends
her folks a service flag to hang
in the window. She doesn't get
much work done, but gawd, she's
impressive.
Type No. 2 is the bandage roller
who's her darndest to get in
her war work hours and the details

on the latest campus murder at the
same time. The threads in the gauze
keep falling out. though, and she
thinks that they'd look a lot cuter
lied in bows. To her. life is a trap.
She doesn't name her bandage, be
cause when she's mad enough to do
so. the attendant is hovering over
her, and after that—well, the cam
pus murders arc more interesting
anyway.
The third type is the eager hea
ver, or the roller who really rolls.
She sits in a corner, her headhand
slipping down over her eyes and
her feet knitting for lielgiun relief,
as she keeps one eye oil the clock
and the other oil her stack of
rolled bandages — awkward, isn't
it?
Now you know what the bandage
room attendants put up with. You
can chew on a piece of gauze if
you're hungry, just so that a band
age eventually turns out. Stanford
mast fill its quota.
