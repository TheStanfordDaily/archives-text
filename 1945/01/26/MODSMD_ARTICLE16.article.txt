# HENRY WALLACE
## 
### 
Every once in a while something happens
on the national political scene which demon
strates that The People aren't so dumb, after
all. The dramatic impact of Wendell Willkie
upon the country is an example of this.
The tremendous popular support of Henry
Wallace for Vice Presidential candidate last
Fall is another such case. In both cases, the
American people emphatically showed their
judgment of a man for what he is—for his
viewpoint and capabilities — rather than for
what he is made out to be by the forces that
oppose him.
In both cases, the political machines were
too well organized, public sentiment too poorly
organized for effective expression of the public
will. But it was heartening, at least, to know
that The People do have a will and haven't
given up hope of expressing it.
Now Henry Wallace comes to public notice
again, but this time The People don't have
much chance to make their opinions felt. Those
who are opposing Wallace fear his tremendous
popularity and the unguestioned integrity upon
which that popularity rests. In the attempt to
discredit him they are trying to fuse and con
fuse several distinct issues which they have
dragged into the current appointment wrangle.
One aspect of this squabble is the question
of splitting and reorganizing the functions of
the office of Secretary of Commerce, and this
aspect is being pushed into the general fracas
instead of being treated as a separate problem.
The question of reorganizing the functions of
this Cabinet post has no real bearing on the
question of the appointment of a Secretary.
A second aspect is Jesse Jones. Perhaps
some valid questions can be raised about the
method by which Jones was removed in favor
of a new Secretary. Such sympathy as we may
feel for Jones, however, is tempered by Jones'
action in making public the President's letter
to him. Evidently Jesse Jones can take care of
hemself pretty effectively without benefit of
our sympathy. Jesse Jones is, actually, "ex
traneous matter." He presents an emotional
factor which is being used by Wallace's oppo
nents to discolor the real question: the qualifi
cations of Wallace for the Cabinet Post of Sec
retary of Commerce as that office now stands.
As to the fitness of Henry A. Wallace for the
post, we can quote Senator Pepper (D., Fla.)
who observed that Wallace "has run the De
partment of Agriculture with its thousands of
employes, and that department has made loans
probably aggregating hundreds of millions of
dollars. He was elected Vice President by the
people of the United States, which meant he
was considered capable of becoming President
if the President were incapacitated."
Also, we can point to the statement of Sena
tor Langer (R., N.D.) who considers Wallace
'in every way qualified for the position," and
predicted that he would be a leading member
of the Cabinet in opposing monopolies and
cartels. He called the appointment "a real
break for the small businessmen and farmers."
We call it a real break for the people of
America; for Henry A. Wallace, besides having
'he qualifications for filling this particular Cab
inet post, has a more important qualification
for high office. He is a man who really believes
in democracy and has a real conception of
what is required to make democracy work in
the worlJ today and tomorrow- flay Wissler.
