"AND Wlll'Ki: DO YOU WAR WORKA. JOHN?"
So, Stanford student, you iiave pledged to do at least
two hours of "war" work ouch week; 24 hours for each
quarter; 9(J hours per year; 57,600 minutes per decade,
and so on; your pledge depending on your prospective
length of residence in your living group or upon your
term of office as a Cellar Dweller.
To fulfill these pledges we feel it necessary to sug
gest certain activities which .should be counted as war
work on the campus.
Crop Crews: Besides (he campus poppy crops which
should be ready for the scythe whenever this frost lilts,
the picking of oranges from round-shouldered trees
around the Farm should be included as war work.
Both time spent working and travel time are to be
counted.
Ilall Maintenance: That quarterly cleaning and
monthly dusting which you give your cell should count.
The weekly emptying of ash-trays, however, will con
stitute only 20 minutes of the two-hour pledge.
Departmental and Y.M.C.A. work: As many stu
dents have offeredâ€”and will prboably offer to mimeo
graph quizzes and finals for professors, we feel that
solely because of the amount of time involved this work
should be included as essential to the war effort. About
the Y.M., il has been suggested by student leaders
whose loyalty has been cfi'awn to the Y.M. on Univer
sity, that hours should be credited according to the
number of pool games shot in an hour. This ruling is
designed to increase the"run" of the players as well
as their w.w. hours. Or as we say in English 25, it is
"twicet bleset."
An Allied Art: Because the directions for scoring
war work hours for spending "footsie" time in the Main
Libe are more complicated, we have saved them till
last.
1. Thirty minutes' credit will be given for each mis
placed lib: 45 minutes for previously floating ribs
which have been sunk or scuttled.
2. Five to 10 minutes for minor cuts and bruises
depending on severity and frequency of appearance.
3. A full quarter's exemption from war work for
each brain concussion.
If this method of tallying proves too difficult for be
ginners, please don't hesitate to ask the librarian for
help. That is what he is there for.
