### Walrus the Carpenter 
(These arc extracts from the Memoirs of John
Bell, forty-second President of the United States,
published in the year 20(H) A.D.)
The nicknames that great men bear are frequently
no less an indication of their own character than of the
temper of the times. That I have been known as "The
Sailor President," a term used in no derogatory sense,
is equally due to my own passion for sailing as it is
to the power of the American Navy and (be consequent
growth of interest in nautical matters among the
people.
During the war I passed some months as an ap
prentice seaman in the U.S. Navy, though without the
opportunity at that time of setting foot on a ship of
any description. My tenure of the Presidency made me
the titular head of that Navy in which 1 once bold the
lowest rank. This fact has seized the wayward imagi
nation of the public, who display in such matters an
infallible instinct for emphasizing the wholly irrele
vant.
Needless to say my political interests could not
allow an advantage to pass without being used. But
now that my retirement from public in'e makes candor
possible, I here express my unmitigated contempt for
(be poltiical support given me for reasons criminally
sentimental and unthinking. 1 owe it to my conscience
to made this admission sometime before my death.
The hobby of sailing has, nevertheless, been a real
factor in my life. No other sport is as capable of taking
the mind away from the anxieties of office. When all
attention is needed to concentrate on the balance of the
ship, the play of the wind, the set of the sails, the
direction of # waves or tide, there is no room left for
other considerations.
My introduction to sailing for pleasure came during
my years at Stanford and after I bad left the Navy.
At Tyler Hall the disciplinarian Smith, resident as
sistant, relaxed lis stringent rules in favor only of those
lads who acted as his sailing crew. A few miles from
the University campus are the waters of South San
Francisco Bay. The city of Palo Alto provided a yacht
harbor and other facilities; too little known, unfortu
nately, to the students of the University.
Smith had a connection with Sea-Scouting and en
rolled some members of the dormitory in bis Palo Alto
troop. On board the Sea Scout ketch, sailing expedi
tions provided the thrills that adolescents naturally
crave, without the concomitant mischicvousness that
too frequently is indulged in at the expense of others
and degenerates finally into a brutal thoughtlessness
of habit and coarseness of mind.
On this boat we learned the channels and I'm
marks ol the South liar, came to know the prevail
winds, the character ol each season of the year and.
by dint nl sitting on top of them, the position of each
shallow mud flat near the Palo Alto yacht hat-tor.
