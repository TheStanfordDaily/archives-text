THE DECISION ABOUT
GERMANY

The Editor. Sir:
It was recently brought to my at
tention an editorial appearing in
Wednesday's Daily concerning oui
postwar aims in Germany. Such os
tentatious intellectualism on the part
of Mr. Wissler, and the editorial in
compatibility of the paper deserves
clarification. That, in my own ob
streperous and calumnious way, I
will attempt to do.
I was deeply interested in the
author's proposal of the re-educa
tion of Germany along American
academic lines. This on the surface
seems a senile and diplomatic solu
tion ol' solving our age-old troubles
with outlaw nations, but let's take

the cover from this learned sugges
tion. Here we would find the seeth
ing, the revolution and the discon
tent that is all too prevalent in the
world today.
For example: Suppose the Japa
nese had overrun this country and
had tried to indoctrinate us with the
spirit of our honorable ancestors and
with those of Hirohito. A wave of
righteous indignation would sweep
the country, probably one of simi
lar intensity that would rage
throughout Germany if your pro
posal, Mr. Wissler, should be forced
to its unjust end. II such is the*
case, and your proposal is found fit-"
ting, to the philosophical problems
of dealing with Germany, he should
send our learned professors and
teachers to Germany armed with
copies of Mein Kampf.
Why Mein Kampf, you should
ask? Because the Germans will hate
everything we should try to teach
them so they might as well get ac
customed to hating Mein Kampf.
While we are introducing such aca
demic reforms in the Reich maybe
we can imbue the German student
with our almighty love of the sheep
skin and our own inimitable way of
sliding through school via the social
ladder. No, Mr. Wissler, here our
own institutions of higher education
can take some pointers from the
schools of Europe.
On the other hand, I think it un
likely if our reforms and policies
will even be considered, so for my
part this may be only a waste of
paper and typewriter ink. The amaz
ing advances of the Russian armies
on the eastern front is a matter of
no small importance.
It is quite evident from military
policy of the Germans, i.e., placing
their best-qualified field command
er, the massing of precious troops
and dwindling equipment •on the
western front, that the Germans
themselves would rather have the
Russians in Berlin before the armies

j of the United States, Britain, and
I France.
Let us analyze this situation. The
; Russians plan on making the
; strong, although dominating her in
dustry and other economic busi
nesses, because they want to utilize
j her manufacturing power, and her
independence and strength is a
! necessary problem to this end.
On our side, we have various pro
posals of making the Reich an agra
rian state, and another irrational
| idea is to re-educate the peoples of
I Germany. I think, and I don't con
j sider myself too far wrong, that we
j will have little to say about what
j will happen to Germany when the
■ peace does come.—Dave Rust (Type

THE DECISION ABOUT
GERMANY

The Editor. Sir:
It was recently brought to my at
tention an editorial appearing in
Wednesday's Daily concerning oui
postwar aims in Germany. Such os
tentatious intellectualism on the part
of Mr. Wissler, and the editorial in
compatibility of the paper deserves
clarification. That, in my own ob
streperous and calumnious way, I
will attempt to do.
I was deeply interested in the
author's proposal of the re-educa
tion of Germany along American
academic lines. This on the surface
seems a senile and diplomatic solu
tion ol' solving our age-old troubles
with outlaw nations, but let's take

the cover from this learned sugges
tion. Here we would find the seeth
ing, the revolution and the discon
tent that is all too prevalent in the
world today.
For example: Suppose the Japa
nese had overrun this country and
had tried to indoctrinate us with the
spirit of our honorable ancestors and
with those of Hirohito. A wave of
righteous indignation would sweep
the country, probably one of simi
lar intensity that would rage
throughout Germany if your pro
posal, Mr. Wissler, should be forced
to its unjust end. II such is the*
case, and your proposal is found fit-"
ting, to the philosophical problems
of dealing with Germany, he should
send our learned professors and
teachers to Germany armed with
copies of Mein Kampf.
Why Mein Kampf, you should
ask? Because the Germans will hate
everything we should try to teach
them so they might as well get ac
customed to hating Mein Kampf.
While we are introducing such aca
demic reforms in the Reich maybe
we can imbue the German student
with our almighty love of the sheep
skin and our own inimitable way of
sliding through school via the social
ladder. No, Mr. Wissler, here our
own institutions of higher education
can take some pointers from the
schools of Europe.
On the other hand, I think it un
likely if our reforms and policies
will even be considered, so for my
part this may be only a waste of
paper and typewriter ink. The amaz
ing advances of the Russian armies
on the eastern front is a matter of
no small importance.
It is quite evident from military
policy of the Germans, i.e., placing
their best-qualified field command
er, the massing of precious troops
and dwindling equipment •on the
western front, that the Germans
themselves would rather have the
Russians in Berlin before the armies

j of the United States, Britain, and
I France.
Let us analyze this situation. The
; Russians plan on making the
; strong, although dominating her in
dustry and other economic busi
nesses, because they want to utilize
j her manufacturing power, and her
independence and strength is a
! necessary problem to this end.
