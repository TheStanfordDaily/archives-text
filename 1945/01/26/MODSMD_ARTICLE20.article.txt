# Squabbling May Block Peace---Bailey
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
(Editorial note: This is another
in our series of artciles about post
war problems.)
"Indifference and squabbling
among ourselves are two of the most
dangerous obstacles to a lasting
peace," believes Dr. Thomas A. Bai
ley, professor of history, and author
of "Woodrow Wilson and the Lost
Peace."
These dangers are well illustrated
in our own Senate, where partisan
ship and misunderstanding are con
stantly stirring up friction among
its members and between them and
the President. This is the Senate
which must be two-thirds united to
approve any treaty. •
The Senate is on record as favor
ing world collaboration, but only in
broad general terms that bind it to
nothing specific. Senators Wheeler,
Taft, and Johnson are the nucleus of
a partisan isolationist bloc which is
encouraged by every serious squab
ble among its opponents. If a formal
treaty is sent to the Senate this bloc
is almost certain to fight it bitterly.
If they fail to stop it by the neces
sarye one-third plus one, they can
still try to take out its teeth with
numerous reservations such as those
which weakened the Versailles
Treaty.

Allied Friction
Misunderstanding and friction are
appearing openly among the Allied
nations, just as they did at the close
of the last war. As we become more
confident of winning, the binding
force of a common foe disappears.
We cling to our allies less desper
ately and squabble with them more.
The Polish and Greek situations il
lustrate this point Well enough.
Our own people are war weary,
tax burdened, and disillusioned with
our allies. We want to get rid of
rationing and go back to peace
quickly and easily. Many returning
soldiers will want to turn back the
hands of the clock to the good old
days without any permanent change.
These facotrs will help form a "do
nothing" bloc that will drift with the
current instead of helping to control
events actively.
All these are discouraging singly,
and Gallup polls already indicate
that many people expect another
war. Our own government is sug
gesting peacetime conscription, "just
to make sure."
Grounds for Optimism
But there are encouraging indi
cations, too, according to Dr. Bailey.

i In many ways our situation is much
I better than at this point in World
: War I.
Now we are less naive. Many an
| "America Firster" was shocked by
I the robot bomb. Isolationists can no
j longer argue that America is safe
J because of her distance from Eu
j rope. Hard facts of modern warfare
I are converting many of them. They
realize that now we are in the same
boat with Europe and that we must
work if we want peace. Senator
Vandenberg's recent spectacular
shift from isolation may be attrib
! uted to this.
Presidential Policies
The Senate is more apt to stick to
j gether than in 1918 because it is
now controlled by the President's
j own party, and as a result it will
I probably back him in passing a
treaty. Roosevelt is a skilled ploi-
I tician who is more diplomatic than
I Wilson, also more experienced, for
j he went through similar days in 1920
j as Wilson's Assistant Secretary of
| the Navy. He has learned from his
| predecessor's mistakes.
! One of the most encouraging signs
I that we may succeed this time, be
' lieves Dr. Bailey, is the committee

containing senators which has re
cently been set up and which if
meeting periodically with the Sec
retary of State It) learn what is go
ing on. The 14)18 Senate never did
quite know our State Department's
plans and was naturally suspicious
of them. But this time as far as pos
sible the Senate is being made a
partner in the peace.

If they fail to stop it by the neces
sarye one-third plus one, they can
still try to take out its teeth with
numerous reservations such as those
which weakened the Versailles
Treaty.

Allied Friction
Misunderstanding and friction are
appearing openly among the Allied
nations, just as they did at the close
of the last war. As we become more
confident of winning, the binding
force of a common foe disappears.
We cling to our allies less desper
ately and squabble with them more.
The Polish and Greek situations il
lustrate this point Well enough.
Our own people are war weary,
tax burdened, and disillusioned with
our allies. We want to get rid of
rationing and go back to peace
quickly and easily. Many returning
soldiers will want to turn back the
hands of the clock to the good old
days without any permanent change.
These facotrs will help form a "do
nothing" bloc that will drift with the
current instead of helping to control
events actively.
All these are discouraging singly,
and Gallup polls already indicate
that many people expect another
war. Our own government is sug
gesting peacetime conscription, "just
to make sure."
Grounds for Optimism
But there are encouraging indi
cations, too, according to Dr. Bailey.

i In many ways our situation is much
I better than at this point in World
: War I.
Now we are less naive. Many an
| "America Firster" was shocked by
I the robot bomb. Isolationists can no
j longer argue that America is safe
J because of her distance from Eu
j rope. Hard facts of modern warfare
I are converting many of them. They
realize that now we are in the same
boat with Europe and that we must
work if we want peace. Senator
Vandenberg's recent spectacular
shift from isolation may be attrib
! uted to this.
Presidential Policies
The Senate is more apt to stick to
j gether than in 1918 because it is
now controlled by the President's
j own party, and as a result it will
I probably back him in passing a
treaty. Roosevelt is a skilled ploi-
I tician who is more diplomatic than
I Wilson, also more experienced, for
j he went through similar days in 1920
j as Wilson's Assistant Secretary of
| the Navy. He has learned from his
| predecessor's mistakes.
! One of the most encouraging signs
I that we may succeed this time, be
' lieves Dr. Bailey, is the committee

containing senators which has re
cently been set up and which if
meeting periodically with the Sec
retary of State It) learn what is go
ing on. The 14)18 Senate never did
quite know our State Department's
plans and was naturally suspicious
of them. But this time as far as pos
sible the Senate is being made a
partner in the peace.

"Indifference and squabbling
among ourselves are two of the most
dangerous obstacles to a lasting
peace," believes Dr. Thomas A. Bai
ley, professor of history, and author
of "Woodrow Wilson and the Lost
Peace."
These dangers are well illustrated
in our own Senate, where partisan
ship and misunderstanding are con
stantly stirring up friction among
its members and between them and
the President. This is the Senate
which must be two-thirds united to
approve any treaty. •
The Senate is on record as favor
ing world collaboration, but only in
broad general terms that bind it to
nothing specific. Senators Wheeler,
Taft, and Johnson are the nucleus of
a partisan isolationist bloc which is
encouraged by every serious squab
ble among its opponents. If a formal
treaty is sent to the Senate this bloc
is almost certain to fight it bitterly.
If they fail to stop it by the neces
sarye one-third plus one, they can
still try to take out its teeth with
numerous reservations such as those
