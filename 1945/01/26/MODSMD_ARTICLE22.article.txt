# Farm Voters Keep Orderly
## 
### ROD BROWNING 
That great Stanford tradition of
voting wihtout bloodshed was main
tained yesterday with very little
gun-plya involved. The students
turned out in full force to vote for
their favorites.
Several dyed-in-the-wool Repub
licans were observed quietly cam
paigning for Dewey. One dear sweet
thing gave a thrilling list of her
qualifications to a small group of ad
mirers. The Republican party im
mediately snatched her up to be the
Republican candidate for President
in '48.
No Poll Tax
One Southerner made quite a
scene when he found out that there
was no poll tax to be paid.
While observing a group of girls
at the polls, a gentleman of the
world was heard to say, "They never
should have given women the right
to vote in the first place."
Expressions Varied
The expressions upon the voters'
faces were of a wide variety. Some
looked pleased, some looked solemn,
but most of them looked very unde
cided. One jovial voter commented
on what a pretty geometric design
he had made with his X's on the
ballot.
Enthusiastic campaigners were
very busy around the polls, giving
out vocal propaganda and confiden
tial advice on the candidates.
Boys Nice, Too!
A certain freshman girl looked
over the list of boys running for
president of the freshman class and
said, "The names all sound so won
derful."
And so the voting is over with,
and everyone is contentedâ€”except
the ones who forgot to vote.
