### JOE SHER 
The Stanford Row, where frater
nity men (at present a minus quan
tity practically) and sorority women
' (this group is really gone, and if
you don't believe it, ask the nation
als) live together in joy and peace
ful harmony.
Here under the spreading chest
nut trees( thanks, Longfellow, old
boy) stands not the smith (although
some that stand under these trees
make that smith look like the 90-
pound weakling who became the
world's most perfectly developed
man), but gay little groups playing
their little games, such as football
and volleyball, while watchful doc
tors stand by and listen to the sound
of breaking bones and snapping gir
dles. It is all in clean fun and every
one has plenty of insurance, besides
hell isn't half full, yet.
It Ain't the Same Old Farm
The houses which once had Greek
letter names and many four-letter
names are now known by such af
fectionate callings as the Chicken
Coop, where all the old hens hang
out, and Rustle Inn, plenty of girls
at home.
The men on the row, are a good
part of the remaining civilian con
tingent on the campus. Where once
brawny fullbacks roamed, 17-year
olds flex their underveloped biceps
and plan ways to dodge the draft for
one more quarter, so they can fool
their boards into thinking that they
should be in college where they
study so very, very hard.
Here saddened 4F's adjust their
trifocals and walk cautiously down
stairs to make things a little easier
for that heart murmer that sounds
like the old mill stream, and dream
of the days when they could drink
gallons of reeb instead of the usual
short one.
Where once snappy convertibles
rode rough shod over the lawns and
street (in an always-to-be-remcm
bered number), battered old jalopies
snort and puff as they hurtle up and
down the Row, doing a wide-open
15. These cars arc usually so fast
that Jess and Gordy are using bicy
cles instead of automobiles to catch
up with them.
Instead of lavish parties and
dances, the fireside and the open
house have become the traps and in
ducements, while frustration reigns
supreme.
But Not Forgotten
Though the good old days in which
so many nostalgically live, have gone
there is still life in the old place yet,
as sophomores pull their sneaks
(you should see what they took
with them), seniors have their par
ties, and the remnants of the fra
ternity men go out and hang one on
once in a while.
In fact, it is rumored that some
of the living groups have added new
property to their houses by annex
ing one of the local ice cream and
potato chip parlors, where, for a
nominal sum, one can get a snoo
oops-scoopful.
Thus, though the days of active
life are gone for Pi Kappa Omi
eron, Gussie Throwberlyussel will
carry on for the duration, fortified
by the men of Monroe, Tyler and
Toyon.

man), but gay little groups playing
their little games, such as football
and volleyball, while watchful doc
tors stand by and listen to the sound

one has plenty of insurance, besides
hell isn't half full, yet.
It Ain't the Same Old Farm
The houses which once had Greek
letter names and many four-letter
names are now known by such af
fectionate callings as the Chicken
Coop, where all the old hens hang
out, and Rustle Inn, plenty of girls
at home.
The men on the row, are a good
part of the remaining civilian con
tingent on the campus. Where once
brawny fullbacks roamed, 17-year
olds flex their underveloped biceps
and plan ways to dodge the draft for
one more quarter, so they can fool
their boards into thinking that they
should be in college where they
study so very, very hard.
Here saddened 4F's adjust their
trifocals and walk cautiously down
stairs to make things a little easier
for that heart murmer that sounds
like the old mill stream, and dream
of the days when they could drink
gallons of reeb instead of the usual
short one.
Where once snappy convertibles
rode rough shod over the lawns and
street (in an always-to-be-remcm
bered number), battered old jalopies
snort and puff as they hurtle up and
down the Row, doing a wide-open
15. These cars arc usually so fast
that Jess and Gordy are using bicy
cles instead of automobiles to catch
up with them.
Instead of lavish parties and
dances, the fireside and the open
house have become the traps and in
ducements, while frustration reigns
supreme.
But Not Forgotten
Though the good old days in which
so many nostalgically live, have gone
there is still life in the old place yet,
as sophomores pull their sneaks
(you should see what they took
with them), seniors have their par
ties, and the remnants of the fra
ternity men go out and hang one on
once in a while.
In fact, it is rumored that some
of the living groups have added new
property to their houses by annex
ing one of the local ice cream and
potato chip parlors, where, for a
nominal sum, one can get a snoo
oops-scoopful.
Thus, though the days of active
life are gone for Pi Kappa Omi
eron, Gussie Throwberlyussel will
carry on for the duration, fortified
by the men of Monroe, Tyler and
Toyon.
The Stanford Row, where frater
nity men (at present a minus quan

' (this group is really gone, and if
you don't believe it, ask the nation

ful harmony.
Here under the spreading chest
nut trees( thanks, Longfellow, old
