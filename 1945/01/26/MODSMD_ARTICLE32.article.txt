A fairly small but militant group
of cage fans has long contended that
basketball is America's most popu
lar sport, not football or baseball as
people not too well acquainted with
the world of sports are apt to be
lieve. For a long time we ourselves
laughed at this contention, but after
feing the tremendous support
which the cage game is receiving at
Stanford this season, we arc inclined
to view the matter in a different
light. Twenty-four teams have en
tered intramural basketball this
quarter, the largest percentage of
the Stanford male population to
compete in athletics since peacetime
days. In addition, the students have
produced an unofficial league bas
ketball team, the first student- I
managed aggregation since the Farm 1
dropped athletics.
National Popularity
A glance at the sports scene 1
throughout the nation shows every
where the same enthusiasm for ca
saba play. It is estimated that more
people participate in official and
semi-official basketball each year
than in any other sport, while it is
a proven fact that this same sport
draws more spectators per game an
nually than any other. Especially in
the East, huge crowds congregate to
watch intercollegiate tilts.
A number of theories are advanced
to explain basketball's populraity.
It certainly must be conceded that
the game requires less time in prep
aration and far less capital than
docs football, and gymnasiums are
far easier to find than are baseball
diamonds, gridirons, or tracks. In
addition, the game itself occupies
less time than do contests of other
popular sports. All this makes pos
/>le participation of a greater num
ber of persons in a greater number
of games.
Spectator Appeal
Nevertheless, the spcetator appeal
of the sport is not so easily ac
counted for. Perhaps the truth is
that, because of the aforementioned
factors, basketball has not been
materially weakened by thewwavr v
Money better used for other things
during wartime does not have to be
diverted to basketball to so great an
extent as it does to other popular
sports. Perhaps people watch bas
ketball because there is so much
more of it than of other athletic
competition.
Or perhaps it is the game itself
that appeals to the public, and the
present trend will continue after the
war. In that case, basketball may
well call itself "America's most pop
ular sport."
