## 
### 
The intramural league swung in
to another session last night 011 the
Pavilian and Encina Gym courts.
The local cage teams put up some
terrific contests, with Phi Psi, Bu
chanan, Tyler, and the AST Cougar
teams coming through with spar
kling wins.
The Phi Psi outfit, paced by Tom
Hood, rolled over the Grizzles; Hood
scored 20 as the Grizzlies were com
pletely outclassed 51-18. The snap
py ball-handling of Dick Marquette
and Bob Nesbit gave the Phi Psi's a
terrific advantage.
The Cougars, led by Red Press
cott, steamrolled the Gerona A.C.
into submission. Presscott bewil
dered the Gerona boys with a dead
eye; his efforts for the evening,

bringing him 25 points. Gerona, up
to this game, had shown great prom
ise.
Buchanan extended its win streak
to 3 tonight, rolling up a 28-23 vic
tory over the Strangers, another
AST organization. McClung of Bu
chanan tallied 10 to lead the scoring
in that game. The game was close all
the time and could have gone either
way, until successive baskets by Mc-
Clung put the game in the bag.
Tyler again took the measure of
the Betas. The game was just as
close as before, with a single point
separating the two teams. The Hill
toppers came out with a 19-18 score
