Latest battlefield report of the
outstanding accuracy of American
heavy artillery comes from France
where a force of Germans, sur
rounded in a stone building, was
putting up strong resistance. De
spite danger to themselves, Ameri
can troops, only 300 yards away from
the German-held building, called
for heavy artillery. An eight-inch
howitzer more than seven miles
away answeredâ€”the first shell fall
ing only 30 yards from the building
and Ihe next three hitting it
squarely.
