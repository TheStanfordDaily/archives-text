# Barber Cuts It Short for Roughs
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
"A semi-military haircut is what most of the boys want now —that is,
clipped up the back with the sides left fairly long," Jim Pennington, owner
of the Stanford Barber Shop, said.
Pennington has owned the shop for 27 years. He has only one assistant
now, Ben Fowler, who has been in the shop for seven years. The first

barber shop at Stanford was lo
cated at Encina. In 1917, the pres
ent shop was established near the
present cigar stand in the Cellar,
under the ownership of Jack Myers,
wno died in ICIB.
Shop Moved
In 1919 the shop, then owned by
Pennington, moved to its present
site in the Union Building.
Mr. Pennington has a record post
ed of all the football games Stanford
has played since 1919, under such
coaches as Andy Kerr, "Pop" War
ner, Tiny Thornhill, and Clark
Shaughnessy. The records line the
walls of his shop. "Many times old
grads come back to see me and have
an argument as to who won a cer
tain game," he said. "All they have
to do is look on the wall to find out.
Saved Razor Strop
"Many old grads have signed the
old razor strop which I have had in
the shop since 1922," he said. One
of the first names on the strop is
Joe Murphy who left Stanford,
passed the Nevada bar examination,
practised law in Nevada for a while
and finally became state senator. He
was later killed in an automobile
accident.
Bob Armstrong and Orm Lewis,
also signers of the strop, are now
practising law together in Phoenix,
Ariz. Oke Miller was a quarter
miler in 1919. He held the Stanford
track record then.
Grads Write Him
"Before the war I got letters from
all over the world from old Stan
ford students. I received letters from
Japan, the Philippines, Ger
many and China," he said. Many
grads still come back to see him
when they visit Stanford, and he
still gets letters from some of them.

When Pennington first owned the
| shop, he gave mostly long haircuts
1 (Hollywoods). A few years ago crew
| cuts were exceedingly popular, but
| he doesn't give many of those any
I more. Strange as it seems, the Mon
roe Scalpers helped his business be
cause the fellows with their shaved
heads had to have their hair shaped
every few days as it was growing
out.
Does Little Shaving
"We don't do much shaving any
more," Pennington - commented.
"Mast men use electric razors, and
the kids don't have much of a beard
: anyway. We don't do many girls'
haircuts, either. Most of them cut
their own hair."
In his spare time, Pennington does
i garden work and improves his prop
erty. Last summer between hair
-1 cuts and shaves, he built himself a
house and claims to be a most effi
cient carpenter.
"Stanford has changed a lot since
i the day I first came here. There
were few cars at first and those that
there were were mostly cutdown
i Fords. I remember, too, when the
Toonerville Trolley used to run up
by the University Press. During the
big game weeks, the boys would
load on the trolley, both inside and
out; and if it wouldn't stop for them,
they would pull it down and even
roll it over on its side."
Fowler thinks that Stanford stu
dents are exceptionally nice to work
on. They insist upon good work and
appreciate it when good work is
done. They are also very faithful to
the shop. They usually get their
haircuts before and after vacations
instead of getting one while they
are home.

when they visit Stanford, and he
still gets letters from some of them.

When Pennington first owned the
| shop, he gave mostly long haircuts
1 (Hollywoods). A few years ago crew
| cuts were exceedingly popular, but
| he doesn't give many of those any
I more. Strange as it seems, the Mon
roe Scalpers helped his business be
cause the fellows with their shaved
heads had to have their hair shaped
every few days as it was growing
out.
Does Little Shaving
"We don't do much shaving any
more," Pennington - commented.
"Mast men use electric razors, and
the kids don't have much of a beard
: anyway. We don't do many girls'
haircuts, either. Most of them cut
their own hair."
In his spare time, Pennington does
i garden work and improves his prop
erty. Last summer between hair
-1 cuts and shaves, he built himself a
house and claims to be a most effi
cient carpenter.
"Stanford has changed a lot since
i the day I first came here. There
were few cars at first and those that
there were were mostly cutdown
i Fords. I remember, too, when the
Toonerville Trolley used to run up
by the University Press. During the
big game weeks, the boys would
load on the trolley, both inside and
out; and if it wouldn't stop for them,
they would pull it down and even
roll it over on its side."
Fowler thinks that Stanford stu
dents are exceptionally nice to work
on. They insist upon good work and
appreciate it when good work is
done. They are also very faithful to
the shop. They usually get their
haircuts before and after vacations
instead of getting one while they
are home.
"A semi-military haircut is what most of the boys want now —that is,
clipped up the back with the sides left fairly long," Jim Pennington, owner
of the Stanford Barber Shop, said.
Pennington has owned the shop for 27 years. He has only one assistant
now, Ben Fowler, who has been in the shop for seven years. The first

barber shop at Stanford was lo
cated at Encina. In 1917, the pres
ent shop was established near the
present cigar stand in the Cellar,
under the ownership of Jack Myers,
wno died in ICIB.
Shop Moved
In 1919 the shop, then owned by
Pennington, moved to its present
site in the Union Building.
Mr. Pennington has a record post
ed of all the football games Stanford
has played since 1919, under such
coaches as Andy Kerr, "Pop" War
ner, Tiny Thornhill, and Clark
Shaughnessy. The records line the
walls of his shop. "Many times old
grads come back to see me and have
an argument as to who won a cer
tain game," he said. "All they have
to do is look on the wall to find out.
Saved Razor Strop
"Many old grads have signed the
old razor strop which I have had in
the shop since 1922," he said. One
of the first names on the strop is
Joe Murphy who left Stanford,
passed the Nevada bar examination,
practised law in Nevada for a while
and finally became state senator. He
was later killed in an automobile
accident.
Bob Armstrong and Orm Lewis,
also signers of the strop, are now
practising law together in Phoenix,
Ariz. Oke Miller was a quarter
miler in 1919. He held the Stanford
track record then.
Grads Write Him
"Before the war I got letters from
all over the world from old Stan
ford students. I received letters from
Japan, the Philippines, Ger
many and China," he said. Many
grads still come back to see him
when they visit Stanford, and he
still gets letters from some of them.
