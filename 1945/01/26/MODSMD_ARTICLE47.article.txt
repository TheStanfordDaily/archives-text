The Army is composed of a num
j ber of distinct personality types. The
! best known of these is the so-called
! "goof-off." To give the reader a
! chance to view the inner workings
jof the goof-oil's mind, we have
I risked our lives in an interview with
a certain private, whom we shall
simply refer to as George.
Slipping quietly into George's
room at O'JoO one moruing we
, found him sprawled across his
: sack (G.I. for hunk), the air being
| filled with assorted nasal sounds.
W'th a cup of water, we aroused
George from his gentle slumber.
He raised a heavy eyelid, murmur
ing, "Gwau! I got up for reveille
yesterday,"and then dropped
quickly back to sleep*
George is a goldbrick. He is simply
' the type of guy who will stick his
foot in a revolving door, so that he
j can sleep more regularly (all the
time) at Dibble, and ride a bicycle
lo classes.
No, we would never slander
George's good name, for actually
he is quite prominent. lie is a
charter member of the "Bayshore
Brigadiers," and regularly assumes
the responsibility of taking roll
call at Burke's — "Sir, all MEN
present." He gives marching an
original twist by chanting a syn
copated cadence all his own. But
don't get the idea that he is not
intelligent, for he is very scientifi
cally inclined, and eager to experi
ment in biology. Only last week he
received a bottle of "Honeymoon
Love Perfume," which, if we are
to believe advertisements, women
cannot resist.
The goof-off is an inhabitant of
"Roble Woods," but during the win
ter migrates into "Branner Canyon."
and is sometimes seen as far south
as ' •The Row." This report is con
firmed by Robert (Blackball) Kelly,
whose book, "The Nocturnal Habits
oi the Goof-ofi." is soon to be pub
lished.
But, alas, the age of the goof
olT is rapidly ending, and he is
most often found in the fossilized
states. Yes, the AXE has fallen.

The incident of the week took
place in our own P. A. One of three
anonymous privates, in a slightly
dazed condition, observed a uni
formed figure aprpoachiijg in the
distance. "Better straighten up,
boys," he whispered. "It's a three
striper." They offered a ceremonious
salute. This is probably the first
time in history that such an honor
was accorded a Greyhound bus
driver.
