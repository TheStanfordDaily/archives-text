One of the top box office attrac
tions at the Metropolitan Opera,
Lauritz Melchojr averages some 25
appearances there a season. It is
estimated that at least 80,000 per
sons a year hear him there.
Melchoir is the last of the great
heroic tenors, but lately he has even
enlarged his public. His frequent
appearances on such radio programs
as Jack Benny's, Fred Allen's, and
Milton Belles' have caused people to
say that he is a wonderful comedian.
They have also made his name a
household word to millions. His
fame will also be extended by his
forthcoming movie, "Thrill of a Ro
mance."
His favorite role is "Tristan," be
cause, as he explain, "You never get
to the bottom of it." Few people
realize that he has also sung many
Italian roles to crowded houses in
South America.
Among his best-known and best
liked records are albums of operatic
arias—mostly from the Wagnerian
operas like "Parsifal," "Lohengrin,"
"The Flying Dutchman," "Siegfried,"
"Tannhauser" and "Tristan and Isol
de." Another of his albums, which
is not so well known, is "Scandina
vian Songs." Some of his finest rec
cords have been collected together in
an album titled "Scenes From Wag
ner Operas," which will be released
by Victor in February.
