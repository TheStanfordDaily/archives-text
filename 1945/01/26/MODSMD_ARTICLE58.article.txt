# Miss Pat Seeks Sizzle in Leaflet's
## 
### MARION MORROW 
"Its the sizzle," smiled Miss Pat Davidson at the Y.W.C.A. discussion
! of leadership yesterday afternoon, "that sells the steak and not the cow."
i"And, she continued, "to quote a brilliant saleswoman, 'if 1 can't find a
j sizzle in this thing called leadership, then I'm a fizzle.'"
i Miss Davidson, executive secretary of the Y.W.C.A., said, "Girls want

to be leaders for two reasons—to -
serve, and to spend leisure time. At
Stanford these motives can be com
bined.
"Leaders can attempt to satisfy
immediate needs, or can take the
long-range view—for certainly peace
will create great demand for lead
ers.
"More Than One Type"
"There is more than one type of
leader. There is the type like a mu
sician or artist who achieves emi
nence by himself, and there are
those who assume leadership in
groups. Most of the leaders of this
latter group start out with drudg
ery jobs."
There is a big difference between
a commander and a leader. A leader
guides the group, develops the indi
vidual. The leader sacrifices for the
individual, while the commander is
interested only in the organization,
Miss Pat commented.
"If the members on a committee
are not happy, it is the leader's fault.
It is up to her to draw out the indi
viduals who need help.
"Short Term Leaders"
"I think it is true that there are
short term leaders and long term
leaders and subtle leaders. Often
times the girls who like to do short
jobs are misunderstood, and are
not called leaders. I think this is
too bad. Subtle leaders, the type
who are very valuable, draw out
girls without anyone knowing.
"No one is a born leader, but ev- i
everyone must learn by hard work, 1
acquiring the qualities necessary be
cause you want to.
"You get to be a leader by stretch
ing your mind, by having flexibility, i
variety, imagination, faith, patience,
and enthusiasm. It is a quality I
which cannot be created, but can be j
recognized and helped. When you
are a leader you can recognize it
in someone else.
"Look at Your Neighbor"
"If you want to discover what !
leadership is, don't look at yourself
—look at your neighbor. If you must i
look at yourself, look in the mirror
and laugh; because you won't see J
what you want to see, you'll see
yourself and then you'll have to go !
out and find what you're looking j
for.
"In times of crisis leadership is j
particularly needed. College pro
vides an ideal opportunity to gain
such leadership.
"Certainly one of the most valu- J
able attributes a leader can have

or develop is a sense of humor. He'll
need it in order to do what he has
to do, know how to do himself, and
be able to show other people.
"Thing Called Tact"
"Another important necessity is
that little thing called tact. To quote
a friend of mine, 'Tact is something
that when you ain't got it everybody
knows you ain't, but when you have
it nobody notices it.'
"The tests of a good leader are the
ability to face the issue, take a few
risks in people, to put yourself in a
position to make a few blunders, and
to be able to give and accept praise
and blame."
"The thing that bothers me about
Stanford leaders and girls is that
they're hoarders. They have talent
and they don't use it. They push off
the job to someone else. Talents are
just like ration points—if not used
they'll be frozen," she concluded.

who are very valuable, draw out
girls without anyone knowing.
"No one is a born leader, but ev- i
everyone must learn by hard work, 1
acquiring the qualities necessary be
cause you want to.
"You get to be a leader by stretch
ing your mind, by having flexibility, i
variety, imagination, faith, patience,
and enthusiasm. It is a quality I
which cannot be created, but can be j
recognized and helped. When you
are a leader you can recognize it
in someone else.
"Look at Your Neighbor"
"If you want to discover what !
leadership is, don't look at yourself
—look at your neighbor. If you must i
look at yourself, look in the mirror
and laugh; because you won't see J
what you want to see, you'll see
yourself and then you'll have to go !
out and find what you're looking j
for.
"In times of crisis leadership is j
particularly needed. College pro
vides an ideal opportunity to gain
such leadership.
"Certainly one of the most valu- J
able attributes a leader can have

or develop is a sense of humor. He'll
need it in order to do what he has
to do, know how to do himself, and
be able to show other people.
"Thing Called Tact"
"Another important necessity is
that little thing called tact. To quote
a friend of mine, 'Tact is something
that when you ain't got it everybody
knows you ain't, but when you have
it nobody notices it.'
"The tests of a good leader are the
ability to face the issue, take a few
risks in people, to put yourself in a
position to make a few blunders, and
to be able to give and accept praise
and blame."
"The thing that bothers me about
Stanford leaders and girls is that
they're hoarders. They have talent
and they don't use it. They push off
the job to someone else. Talents are
just like ration points—if not used
they'll be frozen," she concluded.
"Its the sizzle," smiled Miss Pat Davidson at the Y.W.C.A. discussion
! of leadership yesterday afternoon, "that sells the steak and not the cow."
i"And, she continued, "to quote a brilliant saleswoman, 'if 1 can't find a
j sizzle in this thing called leadership, then I'm a fizzle.'"
i Miss Davidson, executive secretary of the Y.W.C.A., said, "Girls want

to be leaders for two reasons—to -
serve, and to spend leisure time. At
Stanford these motives can be com
bined.
"Leaders can attempt to satisfy
immediate needs, or can take the
long-range view—for certainly peace
will create great demand for lead
ers.
"More Than One Type"
"There is more than one type of
leader. There is the type like a mu
sician or artist who achieves emi
nence by himself, and there are
those who assume leadership in
groups. Most of the leaders of this
latter group start out with drudg
ery jobs."
There is a big difference between
a commander and a leader. A leader
guides the group, develops the indi
vidual. The leader sacrifices for the
individual, while the commander is
interested only in the organization,
Miss Pat commented.
"If the members on a committee
are not happy, it is the leader's fault.
It is up to her to draw out the indi
viduals who need help.
"Short Term Leaders"
"I think it is true that there are
short term leaders and long term
leaders and subtle leaders. Often
times the girls who like to do short
jobs are misunderstood, and are
not called leaders. I think this is
too bad. Subtle leaders, the type
who are very valuable, draw out
girls without anyone knowing.
