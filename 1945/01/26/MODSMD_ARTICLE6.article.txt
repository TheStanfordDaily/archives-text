# ASSU Sets Re-Election

A re-election for the positions on
Men's and Women's Council will be
held Tuesday, Jan. 30, because of a
confusion in the methods of ballot
ing and counting, according to Bar
bara White, ASSU president.
There were two positions vacant
on both councils, but the preferential
ballot provided for only one first
choice. Therefore, in tabulating the
returns, the first and second choices
were given equal weight.
