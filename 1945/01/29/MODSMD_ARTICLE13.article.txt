# TEACHING A WORLD
## 
### 
Some thinking people who believe in the
potentialities of learning and second-hand ex
perience found in the printed word, point to
universal education as the cornerstone to world
understanding.
For a long time this idea has been tossed
about, but—educators often being unassuming
dreamers—few of its proponents have given out
with solid plans backing their theories. One
of these few is Grayson N. Kefauver, dean of
the University's School of Education, who is
now on leave as State Department consultant
on cultural cooperation.
After six months of study and consultation,
Dr. Kefauver recommended this week in an
interim report that the United Nations set up
an educational and cultural agency. Aims of
the agency would include organizing educa
tional programs on Axis nations, restoring
schools and colleges in ravaged countries, re
placing valuable books looted from occupied
nations with similar ones from Axis libraries,
and establishing a global-circulation library of
rare and valuable books.
Now we recognize the necessity for uni
versal, complete education. The next step, per
haps not too far away, is to realize the power
it ran pack, and ponder a while on the determi
nation of its course.
Teaching the world will take many grains of
wisdom and not a few of homely, real horse
sense.—N. S.
