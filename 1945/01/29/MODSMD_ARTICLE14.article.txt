CAMPUS SHORT CUTS
Do you have an impossible schedule which
leaves you just three minutes in which to clash
from Cellar booth No. 7 to room 100? You do?
It does?
Well, today's session is designed to orient
to the Farm both new and old students, profes
sors, ASTudents, especially members of the
Third Platoon which has more than its share of
problems. Say . . . what is the Scheineman
Strut?
No. 1 Problem: to get from the Choir Loft
of Memorial Church to the Sunken Diamond in
four or five minutes when you are no place near
the Church in the beginning.
No. 1 Solution: Starting from the P. 0., which
is an island entirely surrounded by bicycles,
you may take either the direct or the indirect
method to reach Memorial Church. As there
has been much discussion on the value of either,
we suggest a combination of both methods.
Credit for this ingenious method goes to Dr.
Beetsom, noted cartographer and mapmaker,
foimerly of the scientific city of Murvania.
Cut back 32 degrees to the West toward
sleepy Lagoon-ita hake, stopping at the Boat
house (unless you have the bad habit of walking
through walls). The purpose of this backtrack
is to give you a running start when you dash
around Union, leap over the Corp Yard fence,
and bound down the steps by Military Tactics
buildings. This start saves hours and hours be
cause, according to foremost authorities, run
ling is almost always faster than walking. From
the Choir Loft, a flight of stairs leads atop the
Uhurch to a heliocopter station, the existence
of which is practically unknown. Little green
tieliocopters leave this station on the half hour;
'hey are propelled by little green native drivers,

obviously. A student body card and a slight
flight fee will seat you in a heliocop, as we say
in the Stanford Flying Club vernacular.
Although, and here is a slight inconvenience,
the heliocops have to refuel at Burke's. Stu
dents not entraining and detraining at this sta
tion must remain in their seatsâ€”with safety belts
fastened. Life is a trap.
From Burke's to the Sunken Diamond how
ever, there are few air pockets and the trip is
oh-so scenic.
Now, you may feel that this ingenious short
cut is rather hectic, roundabout, or just plain
stupid. You may think that it takes more time
than other possible short cuts. Well, it is and
it does. But to make Dr. Beetsom of the under
ground kingdom happy in his new life with sur
face people, we must follow his advice and use
his plan to maintain our happy, normal Stan
ford family.
See ya in Napa.
