flicting campus function will be permitted.

To the Editor:
After reading the two articles in the Stanford Daily
about the counting of the Men's and Women's Council
ballots in the election, I feel that the action of the
Election Board needs further explanation.
As the ballots were made out preferential, they
were counted in the same manner as the other ballots,
except that the top two people were considered winners
instead of only one person as two positions were to be
filled. Later, a second way of counting preferential
votes in an election for two positions was brought to
light.
I didn't trust my own judgment as to which method
was better, so decided to bring the matter before Exec
utive Committee. On presenting the election report,
before any names or figures of winners were given, I
brought up the two ways of counting, asking Excom
to determine which method they thought, mathemati
cally, would give the fairer results.
During the discussion, a third method for counting
was suggested. A motion was made and approved to
count the ballots according to the third method; then,
if the results differed from the first counting, a new
election was to be held.
After recounting the ballots. Men's Council's dif
fered, but Women's Council's remained the same. There
was further discussion, and then a motion was made
and approved to hold another election for both Men's
and Women's Council.
Had the first motion not been made and approved,
Excom could have investigated the three methods of
counting, all of which, according to members of former
Election Boards, have been used in elections at Stan
ford. They could then have decided which of the three
was fairest, and taken a recount before any results
were given. In this way, the trouble and expense of a
second election would have been avoided. However, as
it is necessary now, many thanks no to Sybil Harrison
for giving more time which we of the previous Elec
tion Board cannot afford.
