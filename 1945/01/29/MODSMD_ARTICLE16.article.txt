# Series Topic 'Geopolitics'
## 
### 
How geography is used to deter
mine national policies will be ex
plainde by Dr. C. Langdon White,
professor o! geography, in a lecture
entitled "Geopolitics and the Global
War" tomorrow night at 7:150 in the
Memorial Auditorium.
In conjunction with the lecture, a
sound film, "Geopolitics — Hitler's
Plan for Empire," will be shown,
which reveals Hitler's scheme for
world domination, as based on the
research of Dr. Karl Haughoffer,
German geopolitician and Hitler's
"brain trust."
The German brand of geopolitics,
which gears a nation's full strength
and resources for war, is brought out
in the film. There are two kinds of
geopolitics—this German kind, and
the American kind which plans just
as fully for mankind's development
during peacetime, according to Dr.
White.
White came to Stanford in 194!}
from Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, where he was director of
the Cleveland Council of Inter-
American Relations. Last summer
at Stanford he directed the Latin-
American program. He has traveled
extensively in South America, Eu
rope, Africa and the Near East, and
is author of two books on geopoli
tics.
