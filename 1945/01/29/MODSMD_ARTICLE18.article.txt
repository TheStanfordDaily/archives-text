# Official Mural Casaba Season Opens Tuesday
## 
### DICK JENNINGS 
The official mural basketball com
petition will start this week as the
new two-league schedule goes into
effect and the 18 teams comprising
the Lagunita and ftohlc leagues be
gin their battle lor the campus
crown.
The new set-up divides the multi
tude of enthusiasts into nine-team
leagues which will play only once
a week. The Lagunita league, playing
on Tuesday nights, consists of the
Betas, Med. 11. Royal Flush, Phi
Psi's, Oilers, Cougars, Arguello

Cards, Buchanan, and Med. I. The
Roble, or Thursday night league, in
cludes Tyler, Legal Eagles, Chinese
Club, Gerona, Cubs, Grizzlies
Strangers, Arguello Whites, and Se
quoia.
Judging from the four rounds of
practice games that have been played
in the last two weeks, we can safely
predict an exciting season of intra
mural play, which will bring out a
lot of hidden basketball ability. The
Lagunita league appears to be slight
ly tougher than the Roble; so the
ployoff between the individual
league winners would probably see
a Lag. squad taking the campus
honors. -
The Beta, Royal Flush, Phi Psi,
and Cougar teams seem the chief
contenders for the Lagunita league
championship, but are so evenly
matched that it is impossible to fore
cast the winner.
The Betas have not been successful
in their preliminary games, being
humbled twice by one-point margins
by Tyler in tight, low-scoring games.
But they will now be augmented by
the services of Morlcy Thompson,
who will he able to play in the Tues
day night games.
The Royal Flush is a rather un
known Army squad, which showed
its worth in its first two games last
week; the R. F.'s boast both aggres
siveness and sharpshooting. Another
Army team which has great potent
ialites is the Cougars, who have been
sparked by Prescott to wins over
Gerona and the Chinese Club.
The Phi Psi's have a terrific com
bination in Marquette, Hood, Pitts,
Ashley, and Nesbit, and make up
for their lack of height with superb
ball-handling. Med. 'II also has a
strong team in the running.
The outstanding aggregations in
the Rohlc league are Tyler, Legal
Eagles, Chinese Club, and Gerona
A. C. Tyler has the only unmarred
record to date from the practice
tilts, hut the Tylermen's victories
have all been close, one-or-two
point noseouts.
The Legal Eagles were squeezed
out by Tyler, but recently have
demonstrated great power by de
feating Med. II and slaughtering the
Arguello Whites. The Chinese Club
and Gerona share the distinction of
being strong clubs that have been
beaten by the Army Cougars.

ployoff between the individual
league winners would probably see
a Lag. squad taking the campus
honors. -
The Beta, Royal Flush, Phi Psi,
and Cougar teams seem the chief
contenders for the Lagunita league
championship, but are so evenly
matched that it is impossible to fore
cast the winner.
The Betas have not been successful
in their preliminary games, being
humbled twice by one-point margins
by Tyler in tight, low-scoring games.
But they will now be augmented by
the services of Morlcy Thompson,
who will he able to play in the Tues
day night games.
The Royal Flush is a rather un
known Army squad, which showed
its worth in its first two games last
week; the R. F.'s boast both aggres
siveness and sharpshooting. Another
Army team which has great potent
ialites is the Cougars, who have been
sparked by Prescott to wins over
Gerona and the Chinese Club.
The Phi Psi's have a terrific com
bination in Marquette, Hood, Pitts,
Ashley, and Nesbit, and make up
for their lack of height with superb
ball-handling. Med. 'II also has a
strong team in the running.
The outstanding aggregations in
the Rohlc league are Tyler, Legal
Eagles, Chinese Club, and Gerona
A. C. Tyler has the only unmarred
record to date from the practice
tilts, hut the Tylermen's victories
have all been close, one-or-two
point noseouts.
The Legal Eagles were squeezed
out by Tyler, but recently have
demonstrated great power by de
feating Med. II and slaughtering the
Arguello Whites. The Chinese Club
and Gerona share the distinction of
being strong clubs that have been
beaten by the Army Cougars.
The official mural basketball com
petition will start this week as the
new two-league schedule goes into
effect and the 18 teams comprising
the Lagunita and ftohlc leagues be
gin their battle lor the campus
crown.
The new set-up divides the multi
tude of enthusiasts into nine-team
leagues which will play only once
a week. The Lagunita league, playing
on Tuesday nights, consists of the
Betas, Med. 11. Royal Flush, Phi
Psi's, Oilers, Cougars, Arguello

Cards, Buchanan, and Med. I. The
Roble, or Thursday night league, in
cludes Tyler, Legal Eagles, Chinese
Club, Gerona, Cubs, Grizzlies
Strangers, Arguello Whites, and Se
quoia.
Judging from the four rounds of
practice games that have been played
in the last two weeks, we can safely
predict an exciting season of intra
mural play, which will bring out a
lot of hidden basketball ability. The
Lagunita league appears to be slight
ly tougher than the Roble; so the
ployoff between the individual
league winners would probably see
a Lag. squad taking the campus
honors. -
