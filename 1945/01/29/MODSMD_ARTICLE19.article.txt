# Electron Microscope Explained

### JANE McENTIRE 
Slightly to the rear of the Stan
ford Museum and in the same pre
earthquake yellow plaster, but mi
nus the lions, stands the Anatomy
building. Like the museum, the
Anatomy Department also has a
treasure which draws interested vis
iotrs from many other fields to see
it—the electron microscope.
To a person who knows almost
nothing about microscopes, the
phrase "electron miscroscope" has
an intriguing sound, but it does not
overflow with meaning .... so Dr.
Greulich of the Anatomy Depart
ment who has used this instrument
a great deal in his research on the
human sperm cell, drew out his pipe
and began to unravel the tangled
differences between an electron mi
croscope and the ordinary micro
scope, so familiar to second quarter
freshmen at this point.
Greater Magnification
Like all aids to man's vision, Dr.
Greulich explained, the election mi
croscope was designed to help hitn
see beyond the limits of the conven
tional high-power microscope. Up
until the development of this new
type of microscope all magnification
was based on the principle of bend
ing light rays through curved lenses
and mirrors so that the distorted
rays would focus on the object in
such a way that it gave the appear
ance. of being many times larger
than it really was. But light rays
will not bend indefinitely, and when
scientists found that the limit of
magnification was about 2.000 diam
eters, and that they hadn't seen the
most important -viruses, they began
to develop another medium foY vi
sion beyond the range of the micro
scope. The result was the electron
microscope.
Machine's Structure
An electron microscope is a gro
tesque machine, large enough to oc

cupy a small room; it is hardly rec
ognizable as kin to the familiar in
struments so beautifully pictured in
health insurance advertisements. In
stead of having the light focused by
glass lenses as it passes through the
barrel of the microscope, the elec
tron microscope has electrons which
are shot from electrodes at the top
of the barrel, thorugh a series of
electromagnets that "focus"' the
stream of electrons before it illu
minates and magnifies the object.
The virus (it can't be more than 1
micron thick!) or whatever is being
examined is placed on a fluorescent
screen so that its structural outlines
stand out like an X-ray photograph.
Biology 2 students will sigh with
envy as they recall hours spent chas
ing pararnecia, and then find out
that research workers who use this
microscope don't have that problem
because they are forced to use dead

, material. The use of this dead ma
! terial is requisite because the oxy
; gen in living matter destroys the
] vacuum which is necessary for the
' electronic principle to work.
Statistically, the electron micro
scope enlarges objects from 50,000 to
! (50.000 diameters easily.

Slightly to the rear of the Stan
ford Museum and in the same pre
earthquake yellow plaster, but mi
nus the lions, stands the Anatomy
building. Like the museum, the
Anatomy Department also has a
treasure which draws interested vis
iotrs from many other fields to see
it—the electron microscope.
To a person who knows almost
nothing about microscopes, the
phrase "electron miscroscope" has
an intriguing sound, but it does not
overflow with meaning .... so Dr.
Greulich of the Anatomy Depart
ment who has used this instrument
a great deal in his research on the
human sperm cell, drew out his pipe
and began to unravel the tangled
differences between an electron mi
croscope and the ordinary micro
scope, so familiar to second quarter
freshmen at this point.
Greater Magnification
Like all aids to man's vision, Dr.
Greulich explained, the election mi
croscope was designed to help hitn
see beyond the limits of the conven
tional high-power microscope. Up
until the development of this new
type of microscope all magnification
was based on the principle of bend
ing light rays through curved lenses
and mirrors so that the distorted
rays would focus on the object in
such a way that it gave the appear
ance. of being many times larger
than it really was. But light rays
will not bend indefinitely, and when
scientists found that the limit of
magnification was about 2.000 diam
eters, and that they hadn't seen the
most important -viruses, they began
to develop another medium foY vi
sion beyond the range of the micro
scope. The result was the electron
microscope.
Machine's Structure
An electron microscope is a gro
tesque machine, large enough to oc

cupy a small room; it is hardly rec
ognizable as kin to the familiar in
struments so beautifully pictured in
health insurance advertisements. In
stead of having the light focused by
glass lenses as it passes through the
barrel of the microscope, the elec
tron microscope has electrons which
are shot from electrodes at the top
of the barrel, thorugh a series of
electromagnets that "focus"' the
stream of electrons before it illu
minates and magnifies the object.
The virus (it can't be more than 1
micron thick!) or whatever is being
examined is placed on a fluorescent
screen so that its structural outlines
stand out like an X-ray photograph.
Biology 2 students will sigh with
envy as they recall hours spent chas
ing pararnecia, and then find out
that research workers who use this
microscope don't have that problem
because they are forced to use dead

, material. The use of this dead ma
! terial is requisite because the oxy
; gen in living matter destroys the
] vacuum which is necessary for the
' electronic principle to work.
