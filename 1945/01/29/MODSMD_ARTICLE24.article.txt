## 
### 
| A large crowd, a new band, and
j sweet music marked the ASC-
I sponsored Army Dance given last
j Friday evening at the Encina Pavil
lion. This affair was the first of the 1
j new Army Dances to be held on Fri
{ day evenings whenever possible. The i
! next dance will be Friday evening, '
I February 2.
With only four rehearsals to their
credit, the new band, which is com*
; posed of both civilians and Army j
! men, rendered sweet music. The
vocals were by Miss Barbara Lang J
of Casa Ventura.
During intermission, the pianist,
the trumpet-player, and the bull j
fiddler, along with one of the sailor
guests, gave out with some lag-time
jazz.
Bigger and better plans are brew
ing for future dances according to
Roy Hansen, dance chairman. Han
sen expressed the hope that these
future affairs will be attended by
as large and appreciative an au
dience as was at last Friday's dance.
