# Love, War, Van Johnson --—All in the Same Movie
## 
### 
This reviewer saw "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" at a local cinema
house which, on Sunday afternoons, is not to be confused with a youth
rally, but only a weekly affair in which Palo Alto mothers break open the
piggy bank, arm the kids with its entrails, and push them out the door to
see a movie. Wearing an old Palo Alto Military Academy uniform and

carrying a lunch box, by way of
guise, I felt reasonably safe once the 1
box office and the portals were be-

hind me, but there
were mo m en t s
when the cries of
the first few rows
brought expeeta
, lion of a personal
appear anc e
of Gene Autry or
Superman. The
picture, what I re
member of it, is a
Hollywood adap-

tation of Jimmy Doolittle's bombing
of Japan; literally, all the title im
plies, and, as usual, there is the love
element and the war neurosis. An
emotional climax occurs when the
leading actor (Van Johnson), crash
landivhis plane along the China coast
(after the bombing of Japan), and
with a ghoulish expression with rain
running down his face says,"I lost
my ship.' 'In spite of various and
conflicting difficulties the hero or
leading man makes his way through
China and back to the states where
Hollywood again injects some
charming pulchritude and the pic
ture ends.
