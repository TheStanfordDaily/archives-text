# Re-Election Scheduled
## 
### 
Because of a confusion in the
methods of balloting and counting
in the recent election, there will he
a re-election tomorrow, January 30,
to fill the four positions open on
Men's and Women's Council, ac
cording to Barbara White, A. S. S. U.
president.
This time there will be only one
election booth which is to be placed
on Engineering Corner and voting

will take place
between 9 a. m.
and 2:30 p. m.,
accor d in g to
Sybil Harrison,
chairman of the
special election.
In tabulating
the returns from
last Wednesday's
election, first and
s e c on d choices
were given equal
weight because
the preferential
ballot provided

for only one first choice despite the
tact that there were two positions
open on both councils.
The final results did not tally,
however, when investigated by Ex
com, Therefore, a re-election will
be held, run on the direct-voting
system. Thus, this time students will
vote for their two choices of candi
dates on each council and no second
or third choices are to be polled.
Despite the fact that the A. S. S. U.
constitution provides for the 'pre
ferential system to he used in all
elections, the direct method lias been
used customarily when two or more
positions were to be filled on th*
same executive or judicial body.
Candidates running for the posi
tions on Women's Council are Inez
Kerr, Jeanne Whisenant, Sylvia
Davis, Mary Sumner, Anne Arm
strong, and Joan Fullinwider. Men
running for the offices on Men's
Council are Wayne Sturgis, Jess
Telles, Crane Honeysett, Herb Zim
merman, and Fritz Koenig.
