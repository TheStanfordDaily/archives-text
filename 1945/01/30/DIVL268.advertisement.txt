"The Lift thai never lets you down"
4) For figure loveliness . . . there's real American beauty
with Perma&Lift. For a miracle, happens at the base
of the bra-cup where a soft cushion inset softly lifts your
bosom, holds that firm rounded contour, never becomes
limp or lax through seasons of washing and ivear. ICiss
the bras good-bye that put red ridges on your preity shoul
ders. There's neither bone, bulk nor pull in Perma&LifCs
gentle support. Bra and Bandeau styles $1.25 to $2.50.
