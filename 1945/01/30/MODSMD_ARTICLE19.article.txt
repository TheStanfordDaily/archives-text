# THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD
## 
### 
In the column opposite us today you win
read some thoughtful consideration of our edu
cation. Last week we had some pros and cons
about education in Germany after the war. Yes
terday we had some more.
These things have come to our attention be
cause events have brought education into the
spotlight.
Stanford has been foremost among universi
ties that have produced technicians with a capi
tal "T" .... its engineers, doctors, and chemists
. . . are its pride and joy, even though most of
what we regard as college life in confined to
other sections of the Quad where the liberal
arts ... at Stanford called humanities . . . reign
supreme.
Students know the conflict in attitudes that
these "sides of the fence" have produced. It's
not an easy thing for our political scientists to
get the scientifically inclined campus ac
tivities, because, besides their lab imprison
ments, they can't see the value of "bothering
about" the transient and ephemeral affairs of the
college world.
Likewise the scientifically-inclined have never
been able to abide by much of the intellectual
sloppiness of our "great thinkers.
It has therefore always been a futile subject
to urge one side or the other to see any common
ground as educated people. However we are
strengthened by some words in the Scientific
Monthly of December which deals with this
question in a manner that is both surprising and
encouraging.
Our generation is going into adulthood under
a passing philosophy that science will ultimately
solve all the "whys" as well as the "hows" of
our existence. Scientists themselves are already
changing their outlook on this question argued
at length here at Stanford last year by an edu
cator and a biologist.
Science will never be able to tell us why we
exist or the values of the things that we pursue,
and who should? Each man will always have to
find that in his study.
It speaks of the failure of education during
the war . . . "the feverish, frantic activity of
reconstruction committees considering "means,"
not "ends," and producing technicians, not
educated people." This article goes so far as to
predict "another national crisis and international
catastrophe."
This may be overstating the case, but the
salient idea is the recognition by science itself
that the means have begun to outrun the ends,
and "destruction outrun construction."
The reconsideration of the role of the techni
cian is not a triumph for the fellows on the other
side of the fence. Honest examination of the
liberal arts ought to make us realize that sound
research and consequent painstaking thought
.vhich all scholars can well afford to borrow
:rom the scientist is being replaced by reckless
ads in thinking and types of inspirational
jourses that merely entertain the student
hrough their college years.
Shortcuts in education have characterized the

war period and there has been little indication
of a change for the future. In the words of our
scientist friend, "Let the pendulum swing back
toward guality . . . we crave something substan
tial something fundamental, that we may help to
educate our poorer brothers."
"Our philosophy is the result of our larger
education, and the universities if they properly
fulfill their function will, not merely by their
instruction but also by their values, establish
the quality of that education and hence of all
the things that stem from it."

terday we had some more.
These things have come to our attention be
cause events have brought education into the
spotlight.
Stanford has been foremost among universi
ties that have produced technicians with a capi
tal "T" .... its engineers, doctors, and chemists
. . . are its pride and joy, even though most of
what we regard as college life in confined to
other sections of the Quad where the liberal
arts ... at Stanford called humanities . . . reign
supreme.
Students know the conflict in attitudes that
these "sides of the fence" have produced. It's
not an easy thing for our political scientists to
get the scientifically inclined campus ac
tivities, because, besides their lab imprison
ments, they can't see the value of "bothering
about" the transient and ephemeral affairs of the
college world.
Likewise the scientifically-inclined have never
been able to abide by much of the intellectual
sloppiness of our "great thinkers.
It has therefore always been a futile subject
to urge one side or the other to see any common
ground as educated people. However we are
strengthened by some words in the Scientific
Monthly of December which deals with this
question in a manner that is both surprising and
encouraging.
Our generation is going into adulthood under
a passing philosophy that science will ultimately
solve all the "whys" as well as the "hows" of
our existence. Scientists themselves are already
changing their outlook on this question argued
at length here at Stanford last year by an edu
cator and a biologist.
Science will never be able to tell us why we
exist or the values of the things that we pursue,
and who should? Each man will always have to
find that in his study.
It speaks of the failure of education during
the war . . . "the feverish, frantic activity of
reconstruction committees considering "means,"
not "ends," and producing technicians, not
educated people." This article goes so far as to
predict "another national crisis and international
catastrophe."
This may be overstating the case, but the
salient idea is the recognition by science itself
that the means have begun to outrun the ends,
and "destruction outrun construction."
The reconsideration of the role of the techni
cian is not a triumph for the fellows on the other
side of the fence. Honest examination of the
liberal arts ought to make us realize that sound
research and consequent painstaking thought
.vhich all scholars can well afford to borrow
:rom the scientist is being replaced by reckless
ads in thinking and types of inspirational
jourses that merely entertain the student
hrough their college years.
Shortcuts in education have characterized the

war period and there has been little indication
of a change for the future. In the words of our
scientist friend, "Let the pendulum swing back
toward guality . . . we crave something substan
tial something fundamental, that we may help to
educate our poorer brothers."
"Our philosophy is the result of our larger
education, and the universities if they properly
fulfill their function will, not merely by their
instruction but also by their values, establish
the quality of that education and hence of all
the things that stem from it."
In the column opposite us today you win
read some thoughtful consideration of our edu
cation. Last week we had some pros and cons
about education in Germany after the war. Yes
terday we had some more.
