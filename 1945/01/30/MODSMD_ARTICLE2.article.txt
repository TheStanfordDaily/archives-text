leaves to mean some kind of special
date; or to have five 2 o'clocks per

of a floater or Saturday 1:30 leave.
Students having suggestions to
make on the subject should attend

so students should feel free to bring
up anything that concerns women
students at Conference, their execu
tive body," Miss Breuner said.
