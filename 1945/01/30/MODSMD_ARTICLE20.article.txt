### Walrus the Carpenter 
The news of the death of a friend, a former Stanford
student, makes one look with altered eyes at the frivol
ities of the present students. Bill was no different from
the typical student in gaiety of disposition, charm of
companionship, or willful thoughtlessness of the mor
row.
Bill failed in his medical course and was promptly
.sent to basic training and to (he Western front where
he was killed in action. The shock of liis passing is
rendered more acute by the reflection that his pre
vious life had done little to prepare him for the
roughness and inexorable finality of his wartime ex
periences.
There is a tendency among our younger students to
gaze on the face of their future and see it as something
too harsh and terrible for further contemplation. They
are not unaware of the grimness of war and even of
the possibility of death, but they prefer to forget this
unpleasant topic, dismissing it as morbid and apt to
unman their resolution.'
Yet by staring straight at it and by the exercise of
the proper thought they can go far towards lightening
its ugly aspect and even towards making the worst
possibilities less probable.
First of all it is imperative to form an idea of
why we are at war and the ends for which we are
fighting. These questions will he answered differ
ently according to the degree of experience and the
temperament of each person, yet a little reading on
th subject is surely not amiss. I recommend two
books. "The Battle Is the Pay-Off" by Ralph Inger
soll and "How New Will the Better World Be?" by
Carl Becker.
Every young man who expects soon to be in the
services owes it to himself to read these volumes with
care. The first will show him the necessity of getting
the utmost out of his military training; the second will
preserve him from a too easy optimism and subsequent
cynicism about the post-war world.
While held in the gentle bonds of (he University
it would be well for our freshmen to reflect on the
woeful lack of preparation (hat most of them bring
to face the rigors of war. If emotional maturity can
be obtained by any conscious means, by taking
thought or even by ""aping the external aspect of
sobriety and calm, let them try to acquire it.
Unfortunately the habits of their contemporaries
lead the average young man along the path of reckless
pleasure, protected by the walls of the University from
the noise of the strife outside. The University itself
would probably do what it could to discourage those
pleasant frivolities,
"If damned custom had not braz'd them so
That they are proof and bulwark against sense."
This leaves it to the individual student. It takes
manly resolution to stand against the press, but even
at that, less manliness and resolution than they shortly
may be called upon to display. Now is the time for
mental preparation for the trial that lies ahead.
