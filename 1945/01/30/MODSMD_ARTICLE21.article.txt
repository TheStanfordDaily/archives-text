LET'S GET ON THAT DIME

Franklin Roosevelt
Washington 7, D C.
Dear Prexy: •
Congrats on your . . . let's see, from Jan. 30, 1945,
take away 1882 except February which has only 28 and
we have log sin of 12 degrees, bring down a capital
seven, carry the common denominator, shove over the
cipher, knit two together, shove back the cipher and
bake in 350 oven for twenty minutes . . . birthday.
We thought you would like to know that we mem
bers of the Jun-i-Or Thunder Riders. Inc., have solidly
backed a campus "cut that class" day as a way of
celebrating Your Day.
We have dispatched our Riders to remote corners
of the Quad, Cellar and Encina Store. Here these grim
acing gremlins will whisper sweet somethings in the
batteries of local DrA.R.'s, 8.M.0.C.'5, and W.C.T.U.'s,
sending them from the classroom to the cinema. Natch.
But, Mr Prexy, it is in these theaters that we have
set a trap for these weaker associated students of Stan
ford. In the middle of a gag or a clinch, the lights will
suddenly flare up, and Salvaged beer cans will walk
up and down the aisles waiting to provide a home for
wayward dimes, quarters, and slugs, campus minted.
So-o-o, we Thunder Riders feel that we have done
our part in putting over the March of Dimes as well as
the Arch of Crimes.
Sincerely,
Future Voters of the Bender Room
