### 
Students still playing in the Cardi
nals all-campus bridge tournament
must play off rounds two and three
and post the results on the Nitery
chart by Wednesday morning, ac
cording to Chairman Margery Troy.
Fourth round begins at 7:30 p. m.

three rubbers will determine win
ners.
Because of confusion in the meth
ods of collecting the 25-cent war
stamps for entry fees, all students
who have not turned in the stamps,
or who did not leave them at the
Bond Booth are asked to bring a
stamp or 25 cents to the ASSU of

will be distributed to prize winners
in the tournament.
