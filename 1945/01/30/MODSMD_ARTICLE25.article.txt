# Service Men Need Books This Week
## 
### 
A request for 150 books to be
denoted this week has been received
from the Palo Alto Service Library.
These books will be taken to a Pa
cific outpost by a group of service
men. The library is continuing its
weekly work of supplying the new
est magazines for Hospitality Mouse,
Dibble General Hospital, and many
units at Moffett Field,
Another request for 500 books to
be sent to one of the most important
harbors in the South Pacific was also
announced by the library. This har
bor is a port of call for Dutch, Nor
wegian, and Fi ench ships, and books
in those three languages are being
sought.
Contrary to popular opinion, the
service men want a minimum of
mystery stories and a generous sup
ply of biography and current fiction.
Book donations should be either
taken to the Public Library or left
at any book shop in Palo Alto. Maga
zines may be left at the California
Avenue Pharmacy, at 1080 Bryant
street, the Southern Pacific Depot,
or in the collection boxes in front
of Larsen & Co. and the Camera
Shop.
