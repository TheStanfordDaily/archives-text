As the hands on the old Ingersoll
neared 4 p. m., we aroused our sense
of curiosity, picked number "4" as \
good as any, and delved into the j
dusty Daily files to find out what |
the sports p;rge of January 30, 1941, '
had to offer for interesting sidelights, i
A full eight-column page, much ,
larger and blacker than the January
30 issue of 1945, showed that Stan- !
ford sports were still in their pre- !
war glory, with everything from
bowling to varsity baseball claiming
stars that were truly sensational. i
Main news of the day was Johnny !
Ward's sensational boxing win over 1
Vic Lindskog which gave him the
all-University boxing championship. I
Over 3,000 fight crazy fans had
watched in the Pavilion the night
before as Ward decisioned Lindskog j
with terrific rights to the head. Little j
lid those 3,000 fans know that today, !
four years .later, Lindskog would be
teaching his boxing tactics to eager
PE students who have idolized Vic J
since they first heard of him on the
1940 champion grid machine.
In column two. Stanford's varsity
baseball nine was given credit for 1
a convincing 2 to 1 win over Keneal
ly's Seals, a team made lip of major

and minor league all-stars boasting
such names as Dario Lodigiani, Babe
Dahlgrcn, Ted Jennings, and Lloyd
Christopher. Interested fans would
recognize su c h famous Stanford
names as Ray llammett, Hal Costello,
and Bolt Ditlevsen on that '41 dia
mond roster.
The Indian hoop squad was trek
ing to Westwood to engage the UCLA
Bruins in a two-game series. The
Deanmen, fresh from a 35 to 31 win
over Cal the previous weekend and
a 44 to 41 victory over Santa Clara
a few nights later, were leading the
PCC southern division with three
wins in as many starts.
This was the year that the entire
Card squad was named on the all
southern division team â€” Kenny
Davidson, Don Williams, Don Burn
ess, Fordy Anderson, and Bill Cow
den. The Indians were nosed out by
Washington State for the Coast title,
too. Little did Burness and Cowden
know then that only one year later
they would be pacing the '42 squad
to a NCAA title in Kansas City.
Still on January 30. the frosh cage
squad was prepping for a twin hill
against Modesto J.C. and San Jose
High. A fellow by the name of Jim
Pollard, who eventually became a
challenger to the inimitable Hank
Luisetti, was leading the yearlings.
Four Years Later
Four years later, on January 30,
we look back with pride upon the
days when Stanford had sports of
the pre-war vintage. To the day
when Stanford once again fills an
eight-column sports page, the Daily
looks ahead.
