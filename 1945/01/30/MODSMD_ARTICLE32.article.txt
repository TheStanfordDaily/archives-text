# Roble League. Starts Tonight
## 
### 
President Roosevelt might be cele
brating his birthday today, but even
that grand occasion cannot take
away the spotlight from Stanford;
for at 7:15, the Roble League will be
inaugurated, with the Beta's vicing
with Sequoia, and Phi-Psi tangling
with the Arguello Cards. And to top
the evening off, at 8:15, Royal Flush
will play Buchanan, and The Oilers
will meet the Strangers.
From past performances, the Beta's
shouldn't have too much trouble
putting away Sequoia. In the prac
tice games thus far, the Beta's took
it on the chin twice in a row from
Tyler, each time by a one-point
decision, but now they have the
services of their top star, Morley
Thompson. With Thompson playing,
the Beta's will be definite title con
tenders.
The Phi-Psi-Arguello game looks
like another one of those affairs in
which Pitts, Ashley, and Hood run
wild over their opponents. If the
Phi-Psi's can keep it up, and from
ail indications they will, it will take
a better team than Arguello to tum
ble them.
In the only other games of the
evening, Royal Flush will attempt
to hold on to its unblemished rec
ord by knocking off the Buchanan
Bearcats. However, the Bearcats
have improved tremendously, and
might be able to do the tumbling.
The Strangers-Oilers encounter is a
toss-up.
