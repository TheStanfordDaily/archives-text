### Elliot Epsteen 
The Oilier Side of the Wallace Affair
The election is not very far back
in time, but it is still behind us, and
with it the congratulatory telegrams
promising support that stem from
the loosing side to the victors. Na
tional issues have again come up,
and the opposing political factions
have, in the best and most healthy
traditions of the parliamentary (or
congressional) system, something
new to collide about.
This time an individual is caught
between the conservative hammer
and the slightly-farther-left anvil.
He is, of course, former Vice Presi
dent Wallace, whom President
Roosevelt has nominated to succeed
Jesse Jt/nes as Secretary of Com
merce. His appointment has caused,
bluntly, quite some bitterness in the
Senate. Some of it is due to the cir
cumstances involved, and some of
it to plain partisanship, but Mr. Wal
lace is being considered for a posi
tion that is at least slightly more
important than Washington pound
keeper, and thus the statesmanship,
or lack of it, that his success would
show on the part of his choosers.
Tlie knotty problem that the issue
turns on is the tremendous financial
power of the RFC. The committee
discussing him was somewhat afraid
of what he would do with it. It al
ways had trusted Mr. Jones; he was
a banker of sound experience, ideas
and integrity, but Mr. Wallace's
economic programs have been in all
circles a cause for controversy.
Mr. Wallace certainly didn't allevi
ate the senatorial fears with his
speech. It was the typical Wallace
oration; he came forth for an eco
nomic bill of rights designed to pro
duce more jobs by national works,
increased markets for private enter
prise, and expanded foreign trade
(the latter to be multiplied three
times).
The great question is: how does
he intend to do this? If Mr. Wallace
could accomplish it by sound busi
ness methods, he would be the great
est statesman that this country has
ever had. But the general plan seems
to be to simply give the produced
goods away, abroad and over here.
That is no solution to unemploy
ment. It is undoubtedly the cause of
greater social ills than economic re
adjustment. The student of history

! must remember that the two greatest
revolutions of the world, the French
and Russian upheavals, came when
the particular countries involved
I were bankrupt.
And this is what the program
j would lead to. The goods have to
! be paid for somewhere. The states
jof Europe probably will not buy
three times as many goods as they
did after the last war because they
| don't have the money.
They will of course give us 1.0.U5.
It would be better if they gave us
nothing; at least their honesty
remain intact. They won't redeem
1 them, and why should they? There
| has yet to be an effective interna
tional bill collecting agency.
Tht> net result is that Mr. Wallace's
plan would put a drain on our na
tional economy that might be dis
asterous. It could possibly lead to
that state of affairs described by the
overworked phrase: "State Social
ism."
Still, putting the argument of the
soundness of Mr. Wallace's methods
aside, there is still one other salient
, point:

They will of course give us 1.0.U5.

Tht> net result is that Mr. Wallace's

that state of affairs described by the
overworked phrase: "State Social

Still, putting the argument of the
soundness of Mr. Wallace's methods
aside, there is still one other salient
, point:
The Oilier Side of the Wallace Affair
The election is not very far back
in time, but it is still behind us, and
with it the congratulatory telegrams
promising support that stem from
the loosing side to the victors. Na
tional issues have again come up,
and the opposing political factions
have, in the best and most healthy
traditions of the parliamentary (or
congressional) system, something
new to collide about.
This time an individual is caught
between the conservative hammer
and the slightly-farther-left anvil.
He is, of course, former Vice Presi
dent Wallace, whom President
Roosevelt has nominated to succeed
Jesse Jt/nes as Secretary of Com
merce. His appointment has caused,
bluntly, quite some bitterness in the
Senate. Some of it is due to the cir
cumstances involved, and some of
it to plain partisanship, but Mr. Wal
lace is being considered for a posi
tion that is at least slightly more
important than Washington pound
keeper, and thus the statesmanship,
or lack of it, that his success would
show on the part of his choosers.
Tlie knotty problem that the issue
turns on is the tremendous financial
power of the RFC. The committee
discussing him was somewhat afraid
of what he would do with it. It al
ways had trusted Mr. Jones; he was
a banker of sound experience, ideas
and integrity, but Mr. Wallace's
economic programs have been in all
circles a cause for controversy.
Mr. Wallace certainly didn't allevi
ate the senatorial fears with his
speech. It was the typical Wallace
oration; he came forth for an eco
nomic bill of rights designed to pro
duce more jobs by national works,
increased markets for private enter
prise, and expanded foreign trade
(the latter to be multiplied three
times).
The great question is: how does
he intend to do this? If Mr. Wallace
could accomplish it by sound busi
ness methods, he would be the great
est statesman that this country has
ever had. But the general plan seems
to be to simply give the produced
goods away, abroad and over here.
That is no solution to unemploy
ment. It is undoubtedly the cause of
greater social ills than economic re
adjustment. The student of history

! must remember that the two greatest
revolutions of the world, the French
and Russian upheavals, came when
the particular countries involved
I were bankrupt.
