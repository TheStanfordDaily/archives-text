# Flyers to Meet Tonight in Nitery
## 
### 
There will be another meeting
tonight at 7:30 in the Nitery for
those who attended the flying club
meeting last Tuesday. Olher per
sons wishing to join are also invited
to attend.
It was decided last Tuesday that
the club should consist of 13 mem
bers and that each member will
furnish $200 toward the purchase of
the airplane. When a member wishes
to leave the club he will sell his
membership for $200, and in this
way no one will lose money, but
merely invest in the airplane while
he is using it.
