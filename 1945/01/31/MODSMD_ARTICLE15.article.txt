# HUBBA, INJUN

### 
This all-campus pow-wow looks like the event that,
may pull the campus together once again in some good
old fun that will be informal, unfussy, and plenty of
chance for the local gags to get an airing.
Rams Head is operating the affair on a Cardinal's
date, but this is really a chance for the students as
a whole to strut the stuff that makes their living group
"unquestionably" the funniest place on campus. In
fact, if you think yours isn't, let this be the thing that
pulls the little nest together with some blood, sweat,
and tears over a "drahma" for the campus.
The pow-wow is backing the right idea about what
the campus can do these days on little gas, less rallies,
and a fair amount of war tension.
Making the Red Cross drive week one of the biggest
weeks of the sclTool year climaxed by this all-campus
event ought to make this a memorable quarter in itself.
In instances such as this it seems that the campus is
getting over the nostalgia of the "used to be" and
making something of the days that are ours around the
quad.
Nothing can be too hammy for this spectacle, nothing
can be too amateurish if there is a spirit behind it that
comes from every group participating and every last
man backing his group by helping and attending
March 2.
