... in the Civ Libe, a combination torture chamber
and date bureau. About the torture—just ask any frosh;
about the blind dates—ask the matron. That's what
she is there for.
... in the Stock Farm—long a favorite of Econ majors
who probably confuse it with the Stock Market, which
is, obviously, a place where you buy and sell cattle.
... in Cellar booth No. 7 —here your little tete-a-tete
will be undisturbed if you remember that "someone
else is waiting for a place from which to bus his own
dishes."
... in the Lake, around which those so athletically
inclined can dash madly.
... in the Quad Corners by moonlight. You can't
depend on the moon to beam but you can depend on the
Hoover Tower.
... in the Museum -a perfect place in which to spend
those cultural late loaves.
Of course, these are only a few of the campus ron
levzous; others are known to sponsors, professors and
\STudents. However, there is one spot on the Fahm
vhich is fast replacing Kingsley Coaching (not quite a
nother, but dearer than a friend to me) as a social
•enter. Even the Cafe Cellar Society rates the Barbecue
° t as number one on their "hit parade."
So won't you . . .
Come with me to the bahbecue pit
And undah the muhmuhing oaks we will sit
Theah we will folic w the bihds and the beet
And muhnuih I ok .>1 those gawd d tree.-.
