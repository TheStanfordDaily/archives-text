GERMAN EDUCATION
The Editor:
January 29, 1945
As a student at the University of California, it is
probably irregular that I write a letter to your paper
with the hope that it will appear in print.
However, by way of explanation, I should say that
a member of my family, who attends Stanford Uni
versity, brings home the Stanford Daily, which I read
with interest. My present letter is in support of an
editorial which appeared in your January '4 issue,
written by Ray Wissler, and which, subsequently,
brought forth a rather bitter reply from one Dave
Rust.
I hoped to see further opinion of the subject of Re
education in Germany in later issues of the Daily, and
still hope that more will be forthcoming, but in the
meantime, I am impelled to write my own feeling re
garding the controversy that has been started by Mr.
Wissler's article.
POINT OF THE ARTICLE
It seems to me that Mr. Rust entirely missed the
point of the article. In the first place, the opinions ex
pressed in the column were stated by Mr. Wissler
expressly, to be those of Miss Dorothy Thompson. I
gathered that his object, in quoting her at such length,
was to stir up opinion and interest among the faculty
and student body concerning the whole question of the
PLACE OF" EDUCATION in the post-war world, rather
than to didactically state what that place should be.
As such, the content of the article cannot be as lightly
tossed aside as Mr. Rust seems to believe. In the second
place, Mr. Rust ponderously discards Mr. Wissler's
thoughtful comments as being "ostentatious intellectu
alism" in that patronizing manner of one who does not
fully understand his subject. Obviously Mr. Rust fails
to grasp the significance of the question at hand, and
dubs it "ostentatious" simply because it is over his head.
POST-WAR GERMANY
The question is hot "What Shall Wo Do With Ed
ucation in Post-War Germany," but, rather; "What
CAN Be Done," period. In this connection one para
mount fact cannot be overlooked: namely, that in pre
war Germany it was, more than any other single fac
tor, the educational system in that country that fostered
and nurtured the Nazi philosophy and made it the force
that it subsequently became.
It was education of the youth of the country that was
responsible for their later fanaticism with the tragic
results we see today. It was the fact that the German
schools and universities pounded the doctrine of State
Socialism into the heads of their students day after
day and year after year that molded the whole thinking
of those students and produced the uncritical, sheep
like mentality of the German people.
MINDS OF THE YOUNG
And it is, therefore, equally true that it will be post
war education in Germany that will continue to mold
the minds of the young. The question is not one. of
sending to Germany American scholars armed with
propaganda to try to "reform" the German youth, it
is simply a question of reorganization from within (as
expressly stated by Miss Thompson) the German
schools, along lines that will create and develop the
critical faculties of Germany's youth.
My interpretation of the editorial by Mr. Wissler was
simply that the place of the university in Germany
would continue to be as important as it has already
shown itself to be there, and that this problem must be
recognized by educators throughout the world.
REALIZATION OF PROBLEM
At your university and mine, at Harvard and Prince
ton and Podunk University, as well as in the high
schools and grammar schools throughout the United
States and all the nations of the world, there must exist
the realization that the problems of readjustment in
post-war Germany will, by their very nature, hinge
around the direction taken by its schools and uni
versities.
Neither Miss Thompson nor Mr. Wissler advocate
the marching into Germany of scholars bent on in
stilling new forms of propaganda in the educational
system, but it is blatantly apparent that with the fall
of Nazism there must come a great change in the ed
ucational system in Germany from what has been their
system over the period of the past 12 years.
Perhaps a little more of the "intellectualism," so
high-handedly discredited by Mr. Rust, is indicated,
these*days, on the part of our own educational system.

results we see today. It was the fact that the German
schools and universities pounded the doctrine of State
Socialism into the heads of their students day after
day and year after year that molded the whole thinking
of those students and produced the uncritical, sheep

MINDS OF THE YOUNG
And it is, therefore, equally true that it will be post
war education in Germany that will continue to mold
the minds of the young. The question is not one. of
sending to Germany American scholars armed with
propaganda to try to "reform" the German youth, it
is simply a question of reorganization from within (as
expressly stated by Miss Thompson) the German
schools, along lines that will create and develop the
critical faculties of Germany's youth.
My interpretation of the editorial by Mr. Wissler was
simply that the place of the university in Germany
would continue to be as important as it has already
shown itself to be there, and that this problem must be
recognized by educators throughout the world.
REALIZATION OF PROBLEM
At your university and mine, at Harvard and Prince
ton and Podunk University, as well as in the high
schools and grammar schools throughout the United
States and all the nations of the world, there must exist
the realization that the problems of readjustment in
post-war Germany will, by their very nature, hinge
around the direction taken by its schools and uni
versities.
Neither Miss Thompson nor Mr. Wissler advocate
the marching into Germany of scholars bent on in
stilling new forms of propaganda in the educational
system, but it is blatantly apparent that with the fall
of Nazism there must come a great change in the ed
ucational system in Germany from what has been their
system over the period of the past 12 years.
Perhaps a little more of the "intellectualism," so
high-handedly discredited by Mr. Rust, is indicated,
these*days, on the part of our own educational system.

GERMAN EDUCATION
The Editor:
January 29, 1945
As a student at the University of California, it is
probably irregular that I write a letter to your paper
with the hope that it will appear in print.
However, by way of explanation, I should say that
a member of my family, who attends Stanford Uni
versity, brings home the Stanford Daily, which I read
with interest. My present letter is in support of an
editorial which appeared in your January '4 issue,
written by Ray Wissler, and which, subsequently,
brought forth a rather bitter reply from one Dave
Rust.
I hoped to see further opinion of the subject of Re
education in Germany in later issues of the Daily, and
still hope that more will be forthcoming, but in the
meantime, I am impelled to write my own feeling re
garding the controversy that has been started by Mr.
Wissler's article.
POINT OF THE ARTICLE
It seems to me that Mr. Rust entirely missed the
point of the article. In the first place, the opinions ex
pressed in the column were stated by Mr. Wissler
expressly, to be those of Miss Dorothy Thompson. I
gathered that his object, in quoting her at such length,
was to stir up opinion and interest among the faculty
and student body concerning the whole question of the
PLACE OF" EDUCATION in the post-war world, rather
than to didactically state what that place should be.
As such, the content of the article cannot be as lightly
tossed aside as Mr. Rust seems to believe. In the second
place, Mr. Rust ponderously discards Mr. Wissler's
thoughtful comments as being "ostentatious intellectu
alism" in that patronizing manner of one who does not
fully understand his subject. Obviously Mr. Rust fails
to grasp the significance of the question at hand, and
dubs it "ostentatious" simply because it is over his head.
POST-WAR GERMANY
The question is hot "What Shall Wo Do With Ed
ucation in Post-War Germany," but, rather; "What
CAN Be Done," period. In this connection one para
mount fact cannot be overlooked: namely, that in pre
war Germany it was, more than any other single fac
tor, the educational system in that country that fostered
and nurtured the Nazi philosophy and made it the force
that it subsequently became.
It was education of the youth of the country that was
responsible for their later fanaticism with the tragic
results we see today. It was the fact that the German
schools and universities pounded the doctrine of State
Socialism into the heads of their students day after
day and year after year that molded the whole thinking
of those students and produced the uncritical, sheep
like mentality of the German people.
