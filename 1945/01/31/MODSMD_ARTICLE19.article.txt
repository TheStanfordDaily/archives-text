# Letter Sent To Roosevelt
## 
### 
The following is a joint letter from
12 university presidents to the Presi
dent of the United States:
"In your annual message to Con
gress you stated that you were per
sonally convinced of the necessity
for universal military training after
the war and intended to send a spe
cial message to Congress dealing
with this subject.
Wait For Victory
"We as citizens venture to express
the hope that you will delay initi
ation of the debate on this highly
controversial question, at least until
complete victory over Germany is
achieved. We have engaged in dis
cussion of this problem with many
persons during the past few months
and have heard no argument which
convinces us of the necessity for
action at this time.
"A continuing program of public
education as to the requirements of
national defense is certainly in order;
but we challenge the necessity of
urging the American people to act
under the tensions of war psychology
in order to bring them to a decision
which, it is said, they would not
reach under more normal Conditions.
High Hope Prevails
"The American people are fighting
the war with high hope it will
eventuate in an enduring peace. If
Congress should now prescribe a
year of compulsory military train
ing. the action together with the
necessary accompanying measures
for mobilizing industry and science
would be interpreted as meaning
that we must continue to live for an
indefinite period in an armed camp.
"Until the post-war international
situation is clarified, it seems to us
extremely unwise and even dan
gerous to commit the nation to such
a revolutionary change in national
policy as the establishment of future
compulsory military training."
