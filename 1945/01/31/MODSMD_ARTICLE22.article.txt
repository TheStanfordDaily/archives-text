intervention of gamblers and
book-making snydicates into organ
ized athletics has long bsen one of
the problems which coaches, man
agers, and owners have had to face.
This bogey has popped up from time
to time for the last 25 years, caus
ing panic in the ranks of coaches
and friends of sports.
It all started hack in l!M!) with the
well-remembered "Black Sox Scan
dal" when the Chicago White Sox,
probably one of (he best professional
baseball combinations of all time, j
arranged to "throw" the World
Series to the lowly-regarded Cin- i
einnati Reds for $100,000. The deal
was made with a loosely organized
group of gamblers, who could not i
raise hall the sum they had named. |
Although the players and gam- j
biers involved were acquitted in the
ensuing fraud trial when the deal j
was discovered, it was this action
which led directly to the establish
ment of the Landis office, which has
been effective in keeping the sport
in line ever since. Upon its creation,
this office immediately banned all
the dishonest members of the White
Sox from baseball for life.
After this disgraceful incident
baseball sank so low in the public
esteem that, according to tradition, ;
it took Babe Ruth to revive it.
Since the present war, the bogey 1
has appeared again. This time bask
etball also seems to be a victim of
its deadly touch. A few months ago
a controversy involving Pliog Allen ;
of Kansas U., dean of American cage
coaches, came out concerning wheth
er or not gamblers had attempted
to bribe his team when it was ap
pearing in Madison Square Garden
last year. Allen stated that some of
his team had confessed to him that '
they had been approached by book- !
makers before the game in question,
while Garden officials, attempting to
defend their reputation, held that
this was impossible. Whatever the
truth of Allen's contention, it is
enough to start friends of sports
thinking.
Yesterday morning we read of
three Brooklyn cagers who confessed
to accepting a bride of SI'.OOO to al- j
low their opponents, Akron U., to :
win the scheduled game. Fortunate- 1
ly the players confessed the deal be- :
fore the game, partially forstalling j
an ugly situation.
Baseball has again been hit. Dutch ;
Leonard, Washington Senators pitch- ;
er, recently revealed that someone >
had attempted to bribe him to throw
that all-important last game to De- [
troit last year. The score of the game |
demonstrates Leonard's integrity: \

Washington 4, Detroit 1. There were
also rumors that "the St. Louis
Browns were intentionally throwing
away their American League lead
for cash in September. The outcome
of the American League pennant
chase disproves this theory, especial
ly as fans of the St. Louis club will
recognize the September slump as
a perennial Browns habit.
The point is: what can he done
about gambling? Shall we have a
Landis office for every sport? Shall
we employ official police forces in
more frequent and strict crack
downs on book-makers? Or shall we
continue to rely on the integrity of
players to expose attempts at brib
ery? With horse racing officially
banned, a lot of loose money is bound
to be looking for new fields in which
to increase itself at the expense of
others. Gambling is a problem which
deserves a lot of serious attention
if athletics are to continue on the
high level they have attained today.

This bogey has popped up from time
to time for the last 25 years, caus
ing panic in the ranks of coaches
and friends of sports.
It all started hack in l!M!) with the
well-remembered "Black Sox Scan
dal" when the Chicago White Sox,
probably one of (he best professional
baseball combinations of all time, j
arranged to "throw" the World
Series to the lowly-regarded Cin- i
einnati Reds for $100,000. The deal
was made with a loosely organized
group of gamblers, who could not i
raise hall the sum they had named. |
Although the players and gam- j
biers involved were acquitted in the
ensuing fraud trial when the deal j
was discovered, it was this action
which led directly to the establish
ment of the Landis office, which has
been effective in keeping the sport
in line ever since. Upon its creation,
this office immediately banned all
the dishonest members of the White
Sox from baseball for life.
After this disgraceful incident
baseball sank so low in the public
esteem that, according to tradition, ;
it took Babe Ruth to revive it.
Since the present war, the bogey 1
has appeared again. This time bask
etball also seems to be a victim of
its deadly touch. A few months ago
a controversy involving Pliog Allen ;
of Kansas U., dean of American cage
coaches, came out concerning wheth
er or not gamblers had attempted
to bribe his team when it was ap
pearing in Madison Square Garden
last year. Allen stated that some of
his team had confessed to him that '
they had been approached by book- !
makers before the game in question,
while Garden officials, attempting to
defend their reputation, held that
this was impossible. Whatever the
truth of Allen's contention, it is
enough to start friends of sports
thinking.
Yesterday morning we read of
three Brooklyn cagers who confessed
to accepting a bride of SI'.OOO to al- j

an ugly situation.

also rumors that "the St. Louis

recognize the September slump as

The point is: what can he done

we employ official police forces in
more frequent and strict crack
