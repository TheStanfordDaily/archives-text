# Gordy Davis Troubled By Bikes, Pedestrians
## 
### MARION MORROW 
' Six hundred and three bicycles,"
said Gordy Davis with a grin, "which
have been lost, have been located
for the owners by the Stanford Po
lice Department in the last three
years."
Gordy has been at Stanford for
15 years, and has been chief since
1941. He was born in Spring City,
Tenn., but came to California early
in his youth.

According to him. on an average of
four bicycles a day are borrowed
from students who "have come out
from their dorms with only 3 minutes
| till class, only to find that some one
else had 4 minutes and has con
i fiscated their bike."
Most of the bikes, he continued,
i are found again, in Palo Alto, on
Quad, at the Cellar, or at one of the
dorms. There is a "Hot File," how
ever, that contains information con
cerning a few bikes that have never
been located. This is due probably
in part to the fact that the owners
sometimes finds his own bike and
does not notify the police. The Police
Department has two bicycles now
with Los Angeles license plates
which have never been claimed.
No Prunefaces Here
Gordy mentioned that on the
; whole "serious offense is on a holi
( day here at Stanford," and that "the
I student body is always more than
| willing to give full cooperation to
| any reasonable request." He con
| tinued to say that it has been a long
1 time since any serious vandalism has
| occurred, and even since professional
j burglars have attempted fraternity
or house robberies.
One problem according to Gordy
is caused by students attempting to
j get a ride on Palm Drive by walking
| up or down rather than standing at
j either end of the drive. "The point
I is," says Gordy, "we don't want any
â–  one run over as so often happens
j when there is consistent hitchhiking.
! Something is certain to happen un
less people use the adequate side-
I walks on either side."
