# Tuesday Series
## While discusses Global Geopolitics 
### 
"Germany developed the way of
thinking and seeing on a global
scale," declared Dr. C. Langdon
White last night when he spoke to
a large Tuesday Evening Series au
deince on the topic "Geopolitics and
the Global War."
Under the supervision of Dr. Karl
Haushofer, leading authority on geo
politics today, and Hitler's "brain
trust" and author and originator of
German's plan for world-wide con
quest, Germany has developed an
Institute for the Study of Geography
in Munich.
In this institute are thousands of
technicians, scientists, geographists,
political scientists, and spies, who,
by fastidiously collecting information
about every country in the world,
have dictated nearly all Hitler's
moves in the first years of the war.
He also told of the theory of "who
commands the heart land commands
the world island and therefore, the
world." which originated with Mc-
Kinder, noted British geopolitician.
McKinder believed that the region
from the Rhine to the Amur River,
and from the Himalayas to the Arctic
was the "heart land" of the world as
it contains two thirds of the world's
land area, seven tenths of its popula
tion, and nearly all its resources.
How Haushofer adopted this the
ory in his plan for German world
domination, and nearly saw it to
completion, was ably illustrated in
an accompanying film, "Geopolitikâ€”
Hitler's Plan , for Empire." Made
when Germany was at the zenith of
her power in the Mediterranean, the
film shows with frightening clearness
how closely Hitler came to realizing
his ambition of global conquest.
But, said Dr. White, "we must not
condemn geopolitics because of the
Germans." Trimmed of its German
propaganda, geopolitics contains
much that is valid, and can be turned
to great advantage in the peacetime
development of the United States
and the whole world.
