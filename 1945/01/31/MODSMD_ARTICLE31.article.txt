"If you cife one of the five early
j risers on campus who rushed over
ito Quad to read the Dippy this
morning, you still may be able to
beat the crowd to the ASSU office
I to purchase one of the five remain
ing bids to the Toyon Sweetheart
! Formal for $2.40."
"Get the ticket first and then
| worry about whom you are going to
ask. There are packs of women on
j campus who are praying to be
asked," said Bob Stevens, president
of Toyon Club.
As each boy takes his "sweetheart"
I through cupid's heart he will bestow
a kiss upon her. Also the Toyon Club
j members are working on other dec
i orations which will be in keeping
â–  with the love theme.
The highlight of the evening, ac
i cording to Bob Gettys, member of
the dance committee, will be the
J entertainment at intermission. Free
