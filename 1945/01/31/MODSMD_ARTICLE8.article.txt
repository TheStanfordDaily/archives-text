# Postwar Conscription Debated by Students
## 
### 
Interest in the question of post
war compulsory military service is
being shown by students, as evi
denced by the audience participation
in the Monday night debate on that
subject, according to Carol Newton,
debate manager.
Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder attended
the debate, and following the re
buttal, Dr. Tresidder summarized

the main issues
of the conflicting
arguments. "The
squad's work on
the Pe a c etime
Conscript ion
question was
given added im
petus by the in
terest shown by
Dr. Ties idder
and the lucid
summary which
he made follow
ing the clash,"
said Miss New-

Members of the affirmative, who
supported the idea of a large reserve
Army culled from annual conscrip
tion of youths for a year's military
service, were Marilyn Dey, Ed
Maher, and Dick Jennings.
Those opposing the plan in favor
of other methods of insuring national
security were Robert Adams and
Gordon Levy.
The local debates on the Peace
time Draft question are being held
in preparation for three debates to
be held with Cal teams, one of which
will take place before the town
council of San Leandro sometime
in March.
Plans are going forward for the
all-campus tournament from Febru
ary 19 to March 9, and students are
still invited to leave suggestions for
a topic in room 20.') C, according to
Miss Newton.
