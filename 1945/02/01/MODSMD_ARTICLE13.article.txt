# Excom Discusses Farm Apathy to War Work
## 
### 
Reporting on the autumn quarter
j activities of War Board at Excom
j meeting last night, Jeannette Grims
| ley pointed out the evidence of a
j general apathy and lack of aware
ness concerning the war and its ac
j tivities among Stanford students.
During the six major weeks of
last quarter a total of 83X7 war
work hours were turned in to
Miss Grimsley, a disappointing
total compared to the two-hours
a-week voluntary pledge of wom
en at the beginning of the quarter.
Salvage drives in University liv
ing groups were notably unsuc
cessful, she said. Aside from the
money contributed during the
bond drive, only $125 in hotids
were purchased throughout the
entire quarter.
Miss Grimsley requested sugges
! tions from Excom to bolster not only
the turnout for activities but the
general attitude of men and women
toward the war.
''There is little to do in the field
! of war activities which we can
present for direct and immediate
accomplishment," she said. "The
activities for which there is a
need—Red Cross courses, depart
nintal work—all require prepara
tion and steady participation on
j the part of students."
Gene Burton, newly appointed
I Men's Co-ordinator. was then intro
-1 duced, and he announced that rep
! resentatives in each men's hall were
1 being appointed through the Men's
Interhall Council.
"If the men would buy stamps
| regularly, contribute blood, volun
teer for collecting salvage, 1 would
j be satisfied. As it is, the minimum
| isn't being done."
Suggestion was trnde tliat a

victory garden bo planted behind
the Row. in which every living
group would have a plot to care
for. Joe Sher suggested steve
dore work in the area for men.
Bernadette Giannini was appoint
ed head of a committee to investi
gate the advisability of changing the
representation and number of vot
ing members on Excom to afford a
better cross-section of student opin
ion. Miss Giannini requested that
all students interested in the ques
tion get in touch with her at the
Daily.
