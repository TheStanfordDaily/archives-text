# LATE LEAVE LAMENT
## 
### 
The "late leave lament," after being squelched
last year by a Women's Conference ruling for
2 o'clock culturals, is again heard in house
meetings, bull sessions, and Cellar conversa
tions as Stanford women discuss the rumors of
regular 2 a.m. late leaves, suggested at Confer
ence this week. And general opinion brought
'o the Daily's attention is "We're all for them!"
Hitting a mid-point between the "no-social
-estrictions-at-aH" school and the "absolute
1:30" advocates, we hang our hopes on a Con
ference suggestion for five 2 o'clock late leaves
to be taken in place of a floater or Saturday 1:30
leave.
Present transportation schedules, which al
low a Stanford woman to see all but the last
act of the current San Francisco play, coupled
with the relaxation of dimout and blackout reg
ulations, lead to one point—the necessity and
desirability of later lockout hours.
Present uncertainty, obscurity, and indecision
Dn the late leave subject, when winter quarter
is already in its fifth week, lead to a more im
portant point—the necessity of making the
tacts and reasons behind each proposed late
leave plan available to all University women for
discussion, decision -for the right to make up
their own minds.—H. D.
