### Walrus the Carpenter 
These are extracts from the Memoirs ot
lohn Bell, forty-second President of the United
States, published in the year 2000 A.D.
The recent publication of Richard Reinhardt's
Autobiography has already made the public
well aware of his Stanford days, the fellowship
at Tyler Hall and the distinguished company
of young men who were later to reach positions
->112 eminence in the fields of politics, theology
and belles-lettres.
My account of those days may well start with
deinhaxdt, who none of us then expected would
oecome the acknowledged Grand Old Man of
\ nerican letters. Those who gaze today on
he kindly, bearded face of Reinhardt, with the
evidence of worldly wisdom and cynical ma
i rity so plain to read in its features or who
enow his subtle intellectuality and pen; rating
visdom from His books, may find it hard to
rredit that he was once a lithe, dark eyed
youngster whose callow innocence had not yet

been destroyed by the activities of an inquiring
mind.
In 1945 there was little to distinguish the
young Reinhardt from his fellows. In social
matters he wasted fully as much time and vital
energy as any other, yet he could perhaps have
been separated from the crowd by his keen
curiosity in matters philosophical and abstract.
I have long been an avid reader of Reinhardt's
books as well as of the monographs that now
more and more frequently appear dealing with
his life and contributions to modern thought.
And it seems to me that even his most pene
trating biographer, Sir Robert Jackson-Hildreth,
Regius Professor, of History at Oxford Univer
sity, has failed to stress adequately the forma
tive influence of his Stanford days on Rein
hardt's mind.
This factor of greatest influence on Rein
hardt's thinking was a survey of the History of
Western Civilization that he attended as a
freshman student. The underlying idealism and
optimistic tenor of this course set many young
minds afire with hope and the prospect of soon
establishing God's kingdom on earth.
The routine of mundane life chased such
giddy notions out of normal minds. But as is
too often the case more brilliant minds are un
able to escape from situations that present no
difficulties or dangers to lesser minds. Rein
hardt's inflamed and roseate views, when they
inevitably met their refutation in later life (out
side University classrooms), aroused in him a
rooted cynicism and despair. This attitude, con
forming as it does so closely with the temper
of the later twentieth century, has made Rein
hardt the seer and the spokesman of our age.
Alas, the torch that burns so brightly to light
the way for others is itself destroyed as a result.

deinhaxdt, who none of us then expected would
oecome the acknowledged Grand Old Man of
\ nerican letters. Those who gaze today on
he kindly, bearded face of Reinhardt, with the
evidence of worldly wisdom and cynical ma
i rity so plain to read in its features or who
enow his subtle intellectuality and pen; rating
visdom from His books, may find it hard to
rredit that he was once a lithe, dark eyed
youngster whose callow innocence had not yet

been destroyed by the activities of an inquiring
mind.
In 1945 there was little to distinguish the
young Reinhardt from his fellows. In social
matters he wasted fully as much time and vital
energy as any other, yet he could perhaps have
been separated from the crowd by his keen
curiosity in matters philosophical and abstract.
I have long been an avid reader of Reinhardt's
books as well as of the monographs that now
more and more frequently appear dealing with
his life and contributions to modern thought.
And it seems to me that even his most pene
trating biographer, Sir Robert Jackson-Hildreth,
Regius Professor, of History at Oxford Univer
sity, has failed to stress adequately the forma
tive influence of his Stanford days on Rein
hardt's mind.
This factor of greatest influence on Rein
hardt's thinking was a survey of the History of
Western Civilization that he attended as a
freshman student. The underlying idealism and
optimistic tenor of this course set many young
minds afire with hope and the prospect of soon
establishing God's kingdom on earth.
The routine of mundane life chased such
giddy notions out of normal minds. But as is
too often the case more brilliant minds are un
able to escape from situations that present no
difficulties or dangers to lesser minds. Rein
hardt's inflamed and roseate views, when they
inevitably met their refutation in later life (out
side University classrooms), aroused in him a
rooted cynicism and despair. This attitude, con
forming as it does so closely with the temper
of the later twentieth century, has made Rein
hardt the seer and the spokesman of our age.
Alas, the torch that burns so brightly to light
the way for others is itself destroyed as a result.
