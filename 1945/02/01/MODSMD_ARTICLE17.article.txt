The rapid progress of ihe Russian army in the
north will soon meet its test. Its strategic measures and
its momentum have prevented the German reaction so
far, so no duel has developed. But. when the Red Army
reaches the lower Oder, the enemy might stabilize his
line.
The Russian progress on the southern end of the
Polish front so dislocated the enemy center that Mar
shal Zhukov's First Ukrainian Army succeeded in
sledgehammering its way along the highway and rail
line leading from Warsaw to Berlin. The troops in the
south reached the upper Oder at Breslau, and then
stopped. Stalin's armies in Hungary launched an offen
sive that seemed designed to feel out German lines and
abruptly halted.
What seems to have happened is that the Russian
high command realized that the best opening they had
was along the central road, and thus shifted troops
from all other sectors and fronts to reinforce Zhukov.
Yet Zhukov's position was and is tricky, since the
army to his north moved away from his line of march,
curving behind East Prussia to cut off the German force
in that province. âœ“
This Red army, the Second White Russian, headed
out northwest, while Zhukov made his progress due
west. In between there is, relatively speaking, a gap.
If the Germans could thrust a large enough force into
it, a little more than equal to either of the two Red
armies, it might fall on one before the other could
reinforce it and cause considerable trouble. Thus, the
decision to put the main power into Zhukov's drive,
probably based on the assumption, borne out by in
formation gained in the Hungarian and Silesian action,
that the enemy was not strong enough on either sector
to cause much trouble, was wise. For this reason,
though, the enemy could stabilize his southern front
without the drastic retreats that this column men
tioned as probably necessary.
But the northern gap Is still there, and the enemy's
only chance lies in taking advantage of it. He would
first have to engage both Zhukov and the Second White
Russian Army in order to prevent either from inter
fering with the maneuver. He has succeeded in the
latter by deliberately letting himself be cornered in
East Prussia, and thus tying it down with a battle of
annihilation. He tried to stop Zhukov at Poznan, a
highly defensible city, but Zhukov bypassed it, and
the next place he can make a stand is Frankfort, a
key rail junction on the river Oder.
Zhukov, meanwhile, is moving to his north, toward
Stettin. Seizure of this port would open a new supply
line for him along the Baltic coast, would deprive Ber
lin of port facilities, and would give the Red Marshal
a long line, slightly concave, thus confusing the enemy
as to his line of approach. This is all the more reason
why the Germans will have to hold Frankfort. With
this bulge in his line, he wouldn't dare overextend it.
Thus the battle of Berlin, and possibly the last of the
war, will be fought at Franklort-on-Oder. If the Ger
mans can hold, they might counterattack. Ii the Rus
v.ans win, they can keep their avalanche going.
