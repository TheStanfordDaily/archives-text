# Squaw Tries Knitting; No Belgian to Wear It!
## 
### CATIIRYN OWEN 
The following story is a simple
tale of a Stanford woman who knit
ted for Belgian Relief. We'll call her
"Squaw" in order to preserve her
anonymity.
Squaw had gone to Dean Mary's
home the first Tuesday afternoon in
the quarter and had brought back

four balls of blue
yarn and a sheet
of in s (ructions,
ing vi n usual
about that
though — every
room in Roble
had its four balls
of blue yarn. But
Squaw was un
usual. No one
heard of the
trials of her size
eight sweater —
the size of all
normal Belgian
sweaters. In fact,
Squaw was nev-

or seen after, the first day of the
quarter.
One night several weeks later,
when I was harvesting oranges on
the Quad, someone tapped me on
the shoulder and whispered that she
had something to show me. I rec
ognized the girl as Squaw, since I
had been introduced to her that first
day, but was startled at her haggard
appearance.
She had looked bad enough the
first time I'd seen her, but that night
she looked particularly ghastly with
whisker-like thorns covering her
nose and her eyes lost in two black
chasms.
However, since she was my room
mate I felt it my duty to befriend
her, and followed her back to her
sanctified portion of our suite at
Roble. Once behind her locked door,
the thorns on Squaw's nose bristled
with delight and she brought forth
her knitting.
It wasn't like any Belgian sweaters
that I had ever seen, but I painfully
nodded my approval, as Squaw
fiendishly twisted my arm. In the
first place, the sweater was of gigan
tic proportions. Besides that, a vivid
red heart was embroidered on the
front.
Squaw confessed that the sweater
was a size 40 that a size eight Bel
gian would be of no use to her—and
that she thought that she was en
titled to get a decent sized man after
knitting a whole sweater. I gasped.
Squaw choked me.
She had written a note proposing

marriage to whomever might get
the sweater and had tacked it on
the inner sleeve. Gasp. Choke.
The next day Squaw once more
invited me into her room. This time
she showed me her trousseau. She
was so obviously thrilled, that I con
descended to congratulate her if
she'd stop gnawing on my ear. She

had made a raft and was ready to
sail for Belgium as soon as her
sweater was sent and her size 40
Belgian answered the note.
And then the sweater was rejected
by the Belgian Relief.
