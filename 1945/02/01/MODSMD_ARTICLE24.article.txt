# Hubert C. Heffner Tells About Dramatics at Stanford
## 
### 808 PECK 
"There always has been a keen
and alive dramatic interest on the
Stanford campus; in fact there is so
much interest that the Eastern col
leges hardly believe it when I tell
them that the students of Stanford
partly financed the Memorial The
ater," said Hubert Heffner, head of
the Speech and Drama Department,
in an interview yesterday.
Mr. Heffner went on to tell how
various people had contributed to a
fund to create a memorial for the
dead of the first World War, and
how Stanford students had decided
to build the Memorial Theater with
this money plus some donated by
the students themselves.
"Twelfth Night" First Play
Mr. Heffner, incidentally, directed
the first play ever produced in Me

morial Theater, "Twelfth Night," in
the summer of 1937. The production
was done under the most adverse
conditions imaginable: the theater
was not completed on time; rehear
sals were impossible; but when the
production went on, it was one of
the best ever presented at Stanford.
Other productions which Mr. Heff
ner rates among the best given in
Memorial Theater are: "The War
rior's Husband," incidentally a play
selected by a contest in the Daily;
"The Bartered Bride"; and "Marco's
Millions," possibly the most ambi
tious production ever undertaken at
Stanford.
Came in 1939
Stanford is the sixth school Mr.
Heffner has taught at. Before com
ing to the Farm in 1939 as head of
the Speech and Drama Department,

he taught at Wyoming, Arizona,
North Carolina, Northwestern, and
California. Mis undergraduate work
was done at North Carolina, and he
received his doctorate at Chicago.
Among his pupils who have made
names for themselves in the dra
matic world are John Sheppard, who
starred in the Broadway production
of "Both Your Houses," and Anna
Lee, who was in Ihe roadshow com
pany of "Lady in the Dark."
While at North Carolina, Mr. Refi
ner was director of the Carolina
Playmakers, who during the summer
toured all of the Eastern states from
Florida to Boston.
Future Plans Uncertain
"Dramatics in a war-time Stan
ford is just hanging on by the skin
of its teeth," Mr. HefYner said. "Lost
at least temporarily to the war are

Mr. Charles Vantz, now with Mac-
Arthur in the Philippines, who was
co-director of the plays; Miss Hazel
Brain, who was chief costumer and
is now with the Red Cross in India; J
and Mr. W. Johanson, formerly chief j
technical director, who is at present
at the Santa Ana Air Base.
Future plans for the spring quar
ter besides the already announced
"The Show-Off"' are uncertain. Mr.
Heffner wants to do a musical on the
order of "Knickerbocker Holiday"
and "Of Thee 1 Sing,"' but it is un- \
known at this time whether such
an ambitious production can be un- j
dertaken.
Son Attended Stanford
On the private side of his life Mr.
Heffner is married and has one son,
now at O.C.S. in New Jersey. Hu
bert Jr. attended Stanford until his

junior year when he entered the
service. Shortly before leaving the
Farm he was elected to Rani's Head,
of which his father is an honorary
member.
Some of the most interesting work
Mr. HefTner has been involved in
concerns the work he did at the
Huntington Research Library in
Huntington Park. Calif. He was
awarded an International Research
Fellowship which enabled him to do
his work there.
Interest in Library
Mr. HefTner is extremely proud J
of the interest created by the Dramaâ„¢
Library at Stanford. It contains out
standing collections of American
theater material, a large section on
American plays, musical dramas,
and books on theater production.
Again in conjunction with this. HefT
ner emphasized the interest which
students and friends of Stanford
alike have taken in the library and
in dramatics on the Farm as a whole.
