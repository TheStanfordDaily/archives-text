# Koenig To Speak at Studies Symposium Today
## 
### 
That the American spirit of inde
pendence in the years following the
American Revolution was exhibited
in the desire to make achievements
in a comparatively unexplored field
of science—that of natural history—
and the work of two outstanding
men of that period, John James Au
dubon and Alexander Wilson, will
be discussed by Professor Frederick
Otto Koenig of the Chemistry De
partment this afternoon on the
American Studies Symposium.
A study of the history of science,
not only American, is one of Pro
fessor Koenig's interests, although
his main one is electro-chemical
thermodynamics. He has been at
Stanford since 1931.

In his talk, beginning at 4:15 p.m.
in the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse, Professor Koenig will
discuss American scientific activity
between the years 1790 and 1830, but
since the main achievements were
the ornithological work of Audubon
and Wilson he will elaborate on
these two men.
Wilson's work, consisting of 265
paintings of native birds, was pub
lished from 1808 to 1813. He was a
Scot who, having failed in every
profession he entered, turned to
painting American birds. John
James Audubon began his series of
bird paintings after he had failed in
many other kinds of work.
He went into the then unexplored

| territories of the states and made
j lifesize sketches of birds that were
j superior in craftsmanship and num
ber to those of Wilson. After his
| death His Admirers formed the Au
dubon Society, devoted to the study
I and protection of birds.
Professor Koenig's talk is the
| second in the American Studies
| Symposium sponsored by theJSchool
| of Humanities, the first and third
Thursdays of each month. A special
evening program discussing govern-
I mental agencies will be on Febru
; ary 21, Arthur Bestor, Jr., of the
I Humanities department, chairman
| of the Symposium Committee,' an
