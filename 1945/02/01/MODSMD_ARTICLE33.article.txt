### B> GLORIA BIIOOKS 
Speaking before an audience of 500
AWVS representatives at the first
meeting of the annual AWVS con
ference at the Fairmont Hotel Mon
day night, Professor Ernest Hilgard,
head of the Psychology Department,
and James Forsyth, Stanford vet
eran, gave their opinions on the
problem of the returning veteran
from the general public, and from
veteran viewpoints.
"Is the Public Ready?" was Mr.
Hilgard's topic, to which he an
swered in the negative. There is
much to be done in accepting the
veteran as a member of the com
munity and understanding how the
particular problem of the million
and a half veterans who will return
during the war differs fx-om the
problem of those who will come
back afterwards.
Both Face Disadvantages
There are advantages and disad
vantages in both cases, Mr. Hilgard
believes. "The man coming back now
will have the disadvantage of physi
cal handicaps which may make him
feel awkward, but he has the ad
vantage of finding self reliance in
holding down a paying job, whereas
the man coming back afterwards
may be physically fit but unable to
find a job."
In speaking of the public attitude
at present, Mr. Hilgard said, "We
aren't at ease, we don't know how
to act, and because of this we tend
to over-react," for example we look
away when we notice a man has a
disability instead of mentioning it.
The "Handicap of social opinion" is
secondary only to the actual physical
handicap of the man, according to
Mr. Hilgard.
Speaking briefly on the problem
of post-war employment, he ques
tinoed the idea of a whole-sale dis
placement of civilian workers so
that the veterans might have the
jobs just because they were vet
erans. "If we can, we must create
jobs for all," he concluded.
The Veteran Speaks
Forsyth spoke on behalf of the
many veterans whom he has ques
tioned at Stanford and elsewhere,
including ihe opinions of such vet
erans on campus as Jim Reynolds,
Jim Valentine, Howard Campbell
and William Middleton. What the
veterans want upon return to civilian
life, what kind of civilian attitude
they expect and what they hope to
contribute to the post-war world
were the three questions he attempt
ed to answer.
"The veteran is not looking for an
abundance of material things to
justify the hardships and sacrifices
he has suffered . . . but a sense of
responsibility. This responsibility
must be carried by all, and the vet- 1
eran is skeptical that the people
who talk and plan and organize will
actually see their plans translated
into action. He is skeptical that he

will be able to find a place to work
and live in with self-respect."
"Sincerity and respectful toler
ance are the two qualities the vet
eran wants most in civilians,"
Forsyth stated. "Offering a veteran
a drink with the remark, 'It's the
least I can do' is dynamite, for he
can't believe people who make re
marks like that are really grateful.
Respectful tolerance can be shown
by letting the veteran 'blow off
steam,' for he feels he has earned the
right to speak the 'hard way.' "
Above all, veterans don't want to
be thought of as a 'thing apart'," in
sisted Forsyth. "Most of the men
with whom I have talked admitted
that they felt closer to America than
ever before in their lives . . . and
they can't understand some civilians
treating them as separate groups."
To the question "What does the
veteran hope can be his contribution
for a better world?" Forsyth gave a
composite answer: "Give us honest
leadership that will translate our en
ergies and ideas into workable forms
. . . and we will follow."
Plea lor Friendship
Concluding his speech with a plea
for friendship between the civilian
and the veteran, Forsyth explained,
"That's what he wants and needs,
your friendship in the finest sense of
the word, in its fullest meaning of
respect and esteem and responsibil
ity."
There were three other speakers
on the program.
Mrs. Chester Nimitz, wife of the
Pacific Fleet's commander in chief,
gave a few ideas to the AWVS on
how they could help war wives,
whose problems she is in touch with
at the Navy Hospital in Oakland.
Dr. Herbert Chamberlain, psychi
atrist, and Captain J. P. Owen, com
manding officer, U.S.N. Hospital at
Mare Island were the two other
speakers.
Dean Mary Yost addressed the
conference Wednesday morning on
"The Senior Citizen's Responsibility
to the Junior Citizen."
