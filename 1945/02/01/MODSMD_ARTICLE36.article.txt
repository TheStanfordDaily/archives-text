# Tresidder Warns of New World Crisis
## 
### 
Warning that "civilization has
reached a perilous point of crisis,"
President Donald B. Tresidder of
Stanford University said last night
at a joint dinner meeting of the
Stanford and Harvard Business
School Alumni Clubs of Northern
California in San Francisco that:
"For the last 50 years our revolu
tionary world has been trending
steadily toward collectivism. If not
checked, this increase in the power
of the state will progress to (he
point where the right to make one's
own decisions will be abrogated
entirely."
Speaking to the Stanford and
Harvard Alumni Clubs at their first
joint meeting since 15)33, the presi
dent warned that "Pearl Harbor
created only a temporary lull in the
urgent problems confronting our na
tional economy. As peace looms on
the horizon, the same old problems
reappear and demand a solution.
Dr. Tresidder then outlned a six
point program to preserve democracy
and free enterprise in America
against the "onrushing tide of col
lectivism." He defined democracy as
"that system where the people are
the source of all power; where the
voters are all equal under the law;
where they choose their own rep
resentatives; and where they have a
court of popular opinion before
which most of their elected rep
resentatives pass for judgment."
The program which the Stanford
president proposed is, as follows:
"Business and government must
get together and stop sparring at
each other like two angry, suspicious
prize fighters. They must develop
confidence in each other and attack
some of our national problems from
a common point of view. If business
expects government to have confi
dence in its ability, it must act the
way it talks and eliminate deceit
and petty tyrany.
"Basic to any planning is a prompt
return to the people of the vast pow
er and liberties we so cheerfully
surrendered to the government as
a vital part of winning the war.
"We must act promptly to revi
talize and support local self-govern
ment if we are to restrain the ex
tension of federal power over our
affairs. Government leaders should
be thoroughly trained at the local
and state levels before they assume
responsibility for management of
national affairs.

"To preserve the largest possible !
measure of free enterprise, manage- |
ment and labor must exercise a high
degree of self-discipline and self
imposed restraint. If they fail to
cope with their own problems or to
deal fairly with the people they arc j
serving, then government will in
tervene.
"Government and business must !
try to articulate their post-war plans I
in such a manner that both will
operate most effectively and not de- [
feat each other by working at cross- |
purposes.
"It is vitally necessary to the sue- I
cess of our plans that we take an |
alert and continuing interest in j
America's greatest future resource—
her youth. Youth is my greatest hope j
for maintaining a free society for J
free men—free to make mistakes i
and free to benefit from the advan- j
tages which we ourselves can |
create."
Dr. Tresidder told the alumni !
groups that he was opposed to col- |
leetivism because "it presupposes a I
group of men at the top who are so I
all-wise, so strong, so omnipotent ]
that they can grasp a thousand dif- j
ferent issues and grind out a single i
policy that will be best for every- '
body."

voters are all equal under the law;
where they choose their own rep
resentatives; and where they have a
court of popular opinion before
which most of their elected rep
resentatives pass for judgment."
The program which the Stanford
president proposed is, as follows:
"Business and government must
get together and stop sparring at
each other like two angry, suspicious
prize fighters. They must develop
confidence in each other and attack
some of our national problems from
a common point of view. If business
expects government to have confi
dence in its ability, it must act the
way it talks and eliminate deceit
and petty tyrany.
"Basic to any planning is a prompt
return to the people of the vast pow
er and liberties we so cheerfully
surrendered to the government as
a vital part of winning the war.
"We must act promptly to revi
talize and support local self-govern
ment if we are to restrain the ex
tension of federal power over our
affairs. Government leaders should
be thoroughly trained at the local
and state levels before they assume
responsibility for management of
national affairs.

"To preserve the largest possible !
measure of free enterprise, manage- |
ment and labor must exercise a high
degree of self-discipline and self
imposed restraint. If they fail to
cope with their own problems or to
deal fairly with the people they arc j
serving, then government will in
tervene.
"Government and business must !
try to articulate their post-war plans I
in such a manner that both will
operate most effectively and not de- [
feat each other by working at cross- |
purposes.
"It is vitally necessary to the sue- I
cess of our plans that we take an |
alert and continuing interest in j
America's greatest future resource—
her youth. Youth is my greatest hope j
for maintaining a free society for J
free men—free to make mistakes i
and free to benefit from the advan- j
tages which we ourselves can |
create."
Dr. Tresidder told the alumni !
groups that he was opposed to col- |
leetivism because "it presupposes a I
group of men at the top who are so I
all-wise, so strong, so omnipotent ]
that they can grasp a thousand dif- j
ferent issues and grind out a single i
policy that will be best for every- '
body."
Warning that "civilization has
reached a perilous point of crisis,"
President Donald B. Tresidder of
Stanford University said last night
at a joint dinner meeting of the
Stanford and Harvard Business
School Alumni Clubs of Northern
California in San Francisco that:
"For the last 50 years our revolu
tionary world has been trending
steadily toward collectivism. If not
checked, this increase in the power
of the state will progress to (he
point where the right to make one's
own decisions will be abrogated
entirely."
Speaking to the Stanford and
Harvard Alumni Clubs at their first
joint meeting since 15)33, the presi
dent warned that "Pearl Harbor
created only a temporary lull in the
urgent problems confronting our na
tional economy. As peace looms on
the horizon, the same old problems
reappear and demand a solution.
Dr. Tresidder then outlned a six
point program to preserve democracy
and free enterprise in America
against the "onrushing tide of col
lectivism." He defined democracy as
"that system where the people are
the source of all power; where the
voters are all equal under the law;
where they choose their own rep
resentatives; and where they have a
court of popular opinion before
which most of their elected rep
resentatives pass for judgment."
