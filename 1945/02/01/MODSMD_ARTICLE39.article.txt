# University Switchboard Answers Odd Questions
## 
### JOHN LARSON 
"Stanford." That is the sweet,
cheery salutation you will hear by
phoning 9411, the University switch
board, better known as a general in
formation bureau which knows ev
erything about everything.
At least it is supposed to be an
encyclopedia of all knowledge, to
be able to answer questions asked
them such as the history and life
story of a California senator Avho
went to Stanford.
A typical nerve-wracker common
near registration is a call such as
this: A woman phones from Palo
Alto frantically asking if her son
has arrived yet; where he is; and if
he is all right. The operator calmly
asks how long ago the boy left; and
on hearing the answer "15 minutes
ago," says something unprintable
under her breath.
Job Interesting
But in spite of, or maybe because
of, these numerous peculiar inqui

ries, the operators still like the job;
mainly, they claim, because it is al
ways interesting and the time passes
quickly. The operators are: Muriel
Gagan, head operator; Beverly
Crothers; Beth Kinder; Katherine
Lightner; and Frances Shambaugh.
A few of the oh-so-numerous
questions asked of them daily are:
"My aunt is visiting the campus to
day; can you locate her?" A pro
fessor's wife: "I think my husband
dropped dead over (here. Will you
go see?" A police investigation
showed he hung up from boredom.
"The willow tree in my front yard
is falling down and looks sick; what
shall I do?" "Would you like to
buy some white rats?" This type of
caller is usually connected with the
Anatomy Department. "Is Profes
sor in his office? I don't
want to talk to him; I just want to
know if he's in."
Oh, for the life of a Stanford tele
phone operator!
Slang Causes Trouble
Two significant troubles are the
new and unknown names attached
to ex-sorority houses and the com
mon use of abbreviated, slang words
for popular campus places.
The switchboard is open from 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. on week days and from
8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays. With
a constant crew of two or three op
erators, approximately 80 outgoing
long-distance calls and 20,000 total
calls are put through daily.
