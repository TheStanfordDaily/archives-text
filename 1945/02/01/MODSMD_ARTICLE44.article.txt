Stanford Players will present "The
Show Off" by George Kelly in a
five-day showing starting Wednes
day, February 7, at 8:15 p. m. in the
Ltitle Theater of Memorial Audi
torium.
This play has been hailed by critics
as the "great American Comedy."
Heyward Broun said, "The Show Off
is the best comedy which has yet
been written by an American."
Is 1924 Play
"The Stanford Players have decid
ed to produce it as a period piece
complete with costumes. This is be
cause the leading character of Aub
rey Piper who seemed so authentic
and so typical to the audiences of
1924 now seems 'dated'F. C.
Strickland, director of the play said.
"The early twenties were pre
depression days and almost everyone
believed that he might be rich to
morrow. But the great Wall-street
crash brought down Aubrey Piper
along with all the other Aubreys of
which he was the symbol." Strick
land said.
Original Setting Necessary
"This does not mean that the play
is any less real or less funny today
as the day when it was first pre
sented, but the play must be seen
in its own setting of time and place
to be fully enjoyed."
Although the play was a great
success in its day, it has not been
widely done, mostly because of the
difficulty of casting the leading role.
This part was originally played by
Louis Bartess, a relatively unknown
actor who became famous overnight,
and then never found another part to
suit him.
John High Takes Lead
"Johnny High will play Ibis part
of Aubrey here, but he does not run
the risk of being discovered and for
gotten in the one part since he has
already been seen in many parts,"
Strickland said.
The three women's roles are larg
er than that of Aubrey. The biggest
role is that of Mrs. Fisher, Aubrey's
mother-in-law, with whom he comes
to live. This will be played by Mary
Higgins. Margaret Morgan will play
Amy, the wife, and Lorna Robert
son .new to Stanford dramatics, will
play Clara, the sister-in-law.
