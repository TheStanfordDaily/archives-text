# Independents Resume League Play Saturday
## 
### 
After a lull of three weeks, Dave
Brown's Palo Alto Independents re
sume league competition in the

i Northern California Basketball As-
I sociation at Kezar Pavilion Satur-
I day night against Chapel of the
! Oaks.
The Independents will be pointing
I for their second win in four starts,
: having lost to Fleet City and Armed
| Guard and beaten Fort MacDowell
in previous contests. The Chapel of
the Oaks team is not rated any too
] strong by virtue of their dismal won-
I loss record, but the combination of
[ Bay Area players have provided some
rough competition for such teams as
Alameda Seftlions and Coast Guard
! Pilots before going down to defeat.
Starters Unchanged
Brown admitted that a lack of
j recent practice sessions might hani
! per his squad's chances for victory,
1 but named his usual starting lineup
j for the San Francisco appearance. A'
forwards will be George Bower and
Morley Thompson, at center Jack
j Heald. and at the guard positions
Ed Douglas and Brown.
Thompson hits consistently been
the sparkplug of the team, and
should be up to expectations in his
hometown pavilion where he played
| high school ball for three straight
I years. Also expected to perform gal
: lantly is Ed Douglas, whose gradual
I improvement has been sensational
jin the recent games against San
: Bruno Nitvy and Auten's.
Brown counts on Luke Pitts,
j guard, to see plenty of acton in the
next games as an alternate on the
first team. Because of the end of
i Bobby Rowe's furlough days, the In
j dependents are without his services
i for the remainder of the season. In
his play at forward, Rowe displayed
some of the expert ability which won
him a berth on the Indian l'rosh team
I a couple of years ago.
This week's resummation of league
play will find the Independents
! heading into the final half of their
j season with numerous games on the
I schedule for the near future. Their
NCBA competition will close against
• St. Marys Preflight early in March.
