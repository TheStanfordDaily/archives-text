Every time we look in a paper,
any paper, we fnd everybody choos
ing some Eastern or Mid-Western
team for the national championship,
or for the outstanding team of the
year, or for that matter, of the cen
tury. Once in a while, the Eastern
writers condescend to give a fair
rating to a Pacific Coast team, and
usually that is because they can
think of no other names to fill their
columns. The same thing holds true
when the Ail-American teams are
being chosen; very seldom is a Coast
player mentioned. Now this has been
going on since the days of Walter
Camp, who chose the first All-
American football team. It was all
right in those days, for Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton were the only
colleges that had teams.
But those days have passed for
ever. and it is about time that the
East and Mid-West have awakened
to that fact. There isn't room in this
paper, or in a volume of papers, to
site the upsets (or so the writers
would have you believe) that have
taken place. We still remember the
time that Stanford's football team
under "Tiny" Thornhill had just
finished a very unsuccessful season.
In comparison to the other Coast
teams, Stanford was not too sharp;
so the writers placed the Indians
down at the bottom of all (he other
teams, for they felt that even the
' st team in the Pacific Coast is
. -i much better, if better at all, than
the weakest team in the other sec
tions.
For a post season game, Dart
mouth traveled out to Palo Alto to
visit the Indians. Dartmouth was
rated as one of the best teams in
the East, which meant that they
were considered one of the best
teams in the nation. "Lowly" Stan
ford beat Dartmouth; the game was
never even close.
And then think of basketball.
Luisetti was a great star every time
that he played, but the East would
not believe it until they saw him in
Madison Square Garden. He made
their favorites look so sick that they
had to admit the fact that Luisetti
was good. Before that time, the
Easterners thought that the one
hand push shot, which some "crazy"
Westerners were using, was a big
fake. Ever since that memorable day
at Madison Square Garden, the East
teams have been slowly changing
over to the one-hand push shot as
their main offensive weapon.
Not to be forgotten either is the
1912 basketball team. They weren't
given a chance before they entered
the national tournament, but that
didn't stop them from winning. In
fact, Stanford beat the favorites.
Dartmouth, by a 53 to 38 score.
or further proof, we add this:
every year, with but one or two ex
ceptions. the East team, in the Shrine
game at San Francisco, had come out
with a cluster of All-Americans and
lias been continually favored, by
odds running as high as 5 to 1. And
every year, with but one or two ex
ceptions, the West has won. Last
year was the payoff, for a bunch of
Westerners, not one of whom had
even been heard of outside the
Coast, dumped an Eastern team load
ed with their traditional All-Ameri- j
cans.
We can't understand how those !
writers can be that stubborn. It is l
probably because they are too lazy I
to check the Pacific Coast teams and {
would rather rest on their laurels
than find out which teams were 112
really the best. We oft. this one
solution: why don't they come out ,
and sec for themselves? We are
pretty sure that they will be con- \
vinced of their error.
