# Mural Cagers Play Tonight
## 
### 
Mural basketball teams will blow
the lid off the brand new Lagunita
League tonight in both the Encina
Gym and Pavilion, according to head
man of mural sports, Harry Wolter.
Tonight's featured game finds the
Legal Eagles tangling with Med. No.
2 in the Encina opener, both teams
favorites to take the league.
The Eagles, off their practice game
triumphs, are likely choices to take
the contest, paced by the high-scor
ing lieinie Hartwell. Med. No. 2 is far
from counted out, however, and
plans to give the Eagles a run for
iheir money.
Aided by Baron Luwe and Faunfty
Ho, the powerful Chinese Club is ex
pected to dump the hapless Arguello
Whites in their bid for league hon
ors. Gerona meets the Grizzlies in
a rematch of the contest which

Gerona nabbed last week.
Two Army squads, the Cubs and
the Grizzlies meet in what should
be a ioss-up fracas.
