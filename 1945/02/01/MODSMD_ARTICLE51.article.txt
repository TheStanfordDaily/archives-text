# Dr. Savelle Tells Importance Of Teaching American History
## 
### VICKY SELLENS 
''The life of a people is like the
life of an individual, and reading the
people's national history for the first
time is like a man getting acquainted
A'ith himself," states Max Savelle,
history professor.
Asked to discuss the importance of
leaching American history in the
high schools, Dr. Savelle spoke of
the study being made of this prob
lem by the Stanford Institute of
American History, of which Profes
sor Edgar E. Robinson is chairman.
Should Appreciate History
At a meeting of the institute Dr.
Savelle said, as quoted by Henry
Pringle in an article, "Why Not
Teach American History," appearing
in the January 20 Saturday Evening
Post, "we require students to go to
.school, and that's not undemocratic.
We require them to read and write,
and that's not undemocratic. If it
is just as important for them to ap
preciate our history, and if we be
lieve in it educationally, we ought
o require it."
The apparent controversy between
historians and professional educators
as to the place of American history
in the schools was precipitated by
a survey published by the New York
Times in April, 1943, according to
Dr. Savelle.
Survey Shows Ignorance
This survey, participated in by
7000 college freshmen, revealed
either ignorance or flippancy on the
part of the majority of tested.
Some of America's most prominent
jitizens were revealed by the test's
answers to have played hitherto un
disclosed roles in the nation's his
tory. Thomas Jefferson became the

President of the Confederacy, Theo
dore Roosevelt was a forest ranger
who "walked on a big stick with a
soft voice," and Abraham Lincoln
achieved immortality for having
emaciated the slaves.
Teach High School iHstory
"It is unfortunate that not all the
states require that students study

history in high school, as the major
ity of students will have no other
opportunity to do so," said Dr.
Savelle, who pointed out that only
one tenth of the nation's high school
graduates attend college.
According to Dr. Savelle, the
study of history has a three-fold
purpose. First, for the enrichment
of the student's own personality by
broadening his cultural horizon and
deepening his understanding of the
problem of human life.
Learn From History
Secondly, for the cultivation in
the student of the attitude of criti
cism and tolerance without which
the democratic way of life cannot
exist, and finally, for the possible
inspiration which some students may
derive from the examples of great
men.
"The nation, like the individual,
must look back on its history to learn
how it reached its present status,
and if the required study of the
growth of the country we are fight
ing for today is nationalism, then
it is nationalism in the best sense."
"For just as the individual," con
cluded Dr. Savelle, ''must have an
understanding of his own back
ground in order to contribute to
the growth of the nation, likewise the
nation as a whole must understand
its own progress n order to contrib
ute to international development."

leaching American history in the
high schools, Dr. Savelle spoke of
the study being made of this prob
lem by the Stanford Institute of
American History, of which Profes
sor Edgar E. Robinson is chairman.
Should Appreciate History
At a meeting of the institute Dr.
Savelle said, as quoted by Henry
Pringle in an article, "Why Not
Teach American History," appearing
in the January 20 Saturday Evening
Post, "we require students to go to
.school, and that's not undemocratic.
We require them to read and write,
and that's not undemocratic. If it
is just as important for them to ap
preciate our history, and if we be
lieve in it educationally, we ought
o require it."
The apparent controversy between
historians and professional educators
as to the place of American history
in the schools was precipitated by
a survey published by the New York
Times in April, 1943, according to
Dr. Savelle.
Survey Shows Ignorance
This survey, participated in by
7000 college freshmen, revealed
either ignorance or flippancy on the
part of the majority of tested.
Some of America's most prominent
jitizens were revealed by the test's
answers to have played hitherto un
disclosed roles in the nation's his
tory. Thomas Jefferson became the

President of the Confederacy, Theo
dore Roosevelt was a forest ranger
who "walked on a big stick with a
soft voice," and Abraham Lincoln
achieved immortality for having
emaciated the slaves.
Teach High School iHstory
"It is unfortunate that not all the
states require that students study

history in high school, as the major
ity of students will have no other
opportunity to do so," said Dr.
Savelle, who pointed out that only
one tenth of the nation's high school
graduates attend college.
According to Dr. Savelle, the
study of history has a three-fold
purpose. First, for the enrichment
of the student's own personality by
broadening his cultural horizon and
deepening his understanding of the
problem of human life.
Learn From History
Secondly, for the cultivation in
the student of the attitude of criti
cism and tolerance without which
the democratic way of life cannot
exist, and finally, for the possible
inspiration which some students may
derive from the examples of great
men.
"The nation, like the individual,
must look back on its history to learn
how it reached its present status,
and if the required study of the
growth of the country we are fight
ing for today is nationalism, then
it is nationalism in the best sense."
"For just as the individual," con
cluded Dr. Savelle, ''must have an
understanding of his own back
ground in order to contribute to
the growth of the nation, likewise the
nation as a whole must understand
its own progress n order to contrib
ute to international development."
