Horace Britt, 'cellist, Viola Was- j
terlain, violinist, and Conrad Held,
piano and viola player, will give
performances of three works tomor- !

which are not often heard although
they were written by famous com

are played much more often than j
their chamber music.

is: Trio in G Major by Beethoven; ;
Serenade, Opus 10, by Dohnanyi, j
and Trio in C Minor by Brahms.
The program will start promptly
at 8:15, and the ushers will close the
door until the end of the first num- j
ber as soon as the music begins.
A few tickets are still available
at the Concert Series office in the
Old Union buildingâ€”they will be on '
sale this afternoon and Friday from t
1 to 5 and Friday evening, just be- j
fore the performance, at the box i
office of the Memorial Theater. ;
Prices are 51.20, $1.80. $2.40. and
$3.00.
