# Press Adds New Books to Series
## 
### 
'"Ships of the Redwood Coast," by
J. C. McNairn, and a book on stage
coach transportation by Oscar O.
Winther will be added this fall to
the Stanford University Press series
on books dealing with early-day
transportation in California.
'"This colorful series has been ex
tremely popular," commented Stan
ley M. Croonquist, sales manager of
the Press. "Paddle-Wheel Days in
California," the story of the river
boats and ferries published last fall,
is now in its third large printing.
Two printings of the revised edi
tion of "Cable Car Days in San
Francisco" have already been neces
sary (six printings in all since pub
lication), and three printings of "Bo
nanza Railroads," the story of the
early narrow-gauge railroads.
