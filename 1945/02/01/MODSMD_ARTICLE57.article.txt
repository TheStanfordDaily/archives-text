# Meat-Hungry Indians Foiled

Have you ever been snipe hunt
ing? No? Well, hear the tale of some
gals who did the other night.
Snipe, it seems, was food for the
gods, nothing tasting quite like hot,
savory snipe. Lured by these words
and enticed by the thought of meat,
two Stanford women treked up into
the hills past Lagunita Lake, famed
resting place for snipe—up—up
climbed the weary hunters.
Armed with sticks and a bag, the
nimble Nimrods were prepared to
flush a covey of snipe from the brush
into the waiting bag. Those who had
gone snipe hunting before were to
frighten the snipe into the open. The
other two were to hold the bag—
but literally.
Much sound of activity came from
the brush and then none. Still the
two held the bag. Night descended.
Darkness fell. The two began shiver
ing. Perhaps this wasn't the season.
Whatever the reason, the gals were
led on a wild goo—l mean snipe
chase. Anyway, happy hunting, all
you snipe-happy people. In fact, let's
have a snipe dinner, you bring the
snipe.
