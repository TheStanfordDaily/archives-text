ALLIED HQ.. Luzon, Friday, Feb.
2 (UP).—U.S. Eighth Army troops,
in their third amphibious operation
this week, have landed on the Bata
nangas coast of Luzon 41 miles
southwest of Manila and placed the
Philippines capital inside a two
army pincers whose jaws were only
GG miles apart, it was announced
today.
The Eighth Army's eleventh divi
sion swarmed ashore without the
loss of a man at Nasugbu, 20 miles
south of Corregidor, and began
striking up the coast toward a junc
tion with elements of Lieut. Gen.
Walter Krueger's Sixth Army which
pushed southward along Highway
No. 3 to within 22 miles of Manila's
northern outskirts.
General Douglas Mac Arthur an
nounced that the goal of the twin
drives was Manila and field dis
patches said the tall of the capital

] was now a matter of days. However,
officers were concerned lest the Jap
anese destroy the city before the ar
rival of the fast-moving Americans.
The new landing, closely following
| two others in the Subic Bay area
j Monday and Tuesday, "largely fields
' off the possibility of enemy troops
! south of Manila joining those to the
I north and definitely outflanks the
j enemy's defense line in southern
• Luzon," Mac Arthur announced.
By landing at Nasugbu, just below
the mouth of Manila Bay, the Amer
i icans followed the same strategy
! used by the Japanese in their con
! quest of Manila more than three
| years ago. The main Japanese force
had landed at Lingayen Gulf and a
secondary force drove ashore at Na
' sabbu on Dec. 24, 1941, to place the
| capital in a pincers similar to that
| now being developed by the Ameri-
I cans.
