# Britt String Trio To Play At Concert Series Tonight
## 
### JANE McENTIRE 
I When the lights dim in Memorial Hall tonight and the artists of the
Britt Trio take their places on the stage, we in the audience will see three
j well-poised musicians whose personalities are bound together by the music
' they play. But as the red curtain falls and the house-lights' glare reminds
| us that the fantasy of the evening is over, we will begin to wonder what

j the performers are like as people,
j where they came from, and how they
1 got their iraining.
I Horace Britt, who organized the
' Trio a year ago, was born in Paris.
When he was 7 year old, he began
!to play the cello—it must have been
j considerably bigger than he was
! then. Later, when Britt was 11, he
| went to the Paris National Conser
' vatory of Music where he was a
i pupil of the French music teacher,
Jules Delsart. By the time he was
14, Horace Britt had been playing j
the cello for seven years. As proof j
that he was an outstanding pupil, I
! he won first prize that same year |
| for his artistry on the cello.
Conductor Too
Since his student days, Britt has I
toured the United States, Canada, I
and South America, both as per
former and conductor.
He is also an honorary professor of
music at the University of Mexico.
Horace Britt doesn't confine his j
hunting talents to unearthing ob
scure but melodious compositions of
famous composers; he has also hunt
| ed big game in French-Indo China,
an illustration of the fact that he
1 is not only a fine musician but also
an expert marksman and fencer.
Violinist Praised
Viola Wasterlain has the distinc
tion of being one of the few women
violinists to receive high praise from
those music critics who very often
give new artists a dour reception in
the press.
Miss Wasterlain is an American of
Spanish and Belgian descent who has
studied with some of the greatest
contemporary violin masters, Gregor !
Cherniavsky, Paul Kochanski, and i
Caesar Thompson.
Native of U. S.
While all the members of the Trio
are American citizens, Conrad Held
is the only one who was born, bred,
and trained in the States. He gradu
! ated from the Institute of Musical
: Art in New York

He has mastered, as the result of
j a childhood crisis, the viola, an in—
] strument some people consider more
difficult to play than the violin. Until
Conrad Held was 12, he had never
played this instrument. But one day
! as his friends were practicing a quar
' tet number, they discovered that no
one knew how to play the viola part,
so the adventurous seventh-grader
promptly volunteered to learn it; he
played the viola part in Beethoven's
' C Minor Quar.tet less than a week
i later.
; Furniture Hobby
For the last several years, Held
j has played chamber music both in
I Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague CooLidge's
' South Mountain Quartet, and on the


HORACE BRITT. 'cellist; CONit AD HELD, piano and viola player,
and VIOLA WASTERLAIN, composing the Britt Trio which will pla\
here tonight.
