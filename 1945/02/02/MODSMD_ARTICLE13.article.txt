# TAKE THE TOUGH ONES

### 
The winter quarter calendar is standing on
its own two feet now and the latest good news
is that the Debate Society is asking for campus
topics to debate.
This can be a great service to the campus.
Ideas aren't as scarce as we sometimes cyni
cally say, and as some Campus Opinion let
ters have indicated lately. We must remember,
however, that as students, most of us are just
learning to think in an effectively responsible
way, and forums between students and pro
fessors are not encouraging to aspiring orators.
Debate therefore can provide a genuine im
petus to the effective solution of many campus
problems.
It is our earnest hope that the debaters will
not hesitate to tackle the most formidable of
these problems. In the first place, because only
the most formidable will arouse the confidence
and interest of the student body, and secondly,
because most of the campus problems are only
formidable because they have not been suffi
ciently and openly discussed among the stu
dent body factions.
Suggestions from Excom were "third person
responsibility" and other phases of the honor
code. We might add further that this is a topic
that not only needs further discussion and some
courageous decisions, but which will find a
strong, interested following among the students.
Nothing is more deserving and needful of
student effort and interest than honor code in
erpretation. Right now interest seems to be re
newed and vigorous, and reconsideration of
he enforcement and theory is essential to
strengthening and adapting it to the college
i f e we anticipate and hope to find after the
vrir.
Suggested questions for debate and support
rom the student body can make this new plan
jl Debate Council a forceful influence in mold
ng the post-war student organization that is
Dossible and attainable if we utilize such op
oortunities as these available to us.
