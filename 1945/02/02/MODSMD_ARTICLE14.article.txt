### Walrus the Carpenter 
The following is an extract from"The Memoirs of
John Bell," forty-second President of the United
States, published in the year 2000 A.L). (editorial
note—and is disowned by the editor).
A student newspaper publication was the miniature
arena where youthful journalistic gladiators received
their training. It is only rarely, however, that promi
nent journalists are produced by this method. The taU
ents that would make a great journalist prove useful
in other directions, more socially preferential or likely
to be passed among more agreeable companions.
The outstanding exception to this general trend is
Miss B. G., who started as editor of the Stanford Daily
in 1945 and suffered no setback throughout a long
career and an unusual one for a woman. At a presen
tation banquet, on her retirement from the editorial
chair of the Podunk Gazette, she recalled the old Stan
ford Daily in a series of reminiscences.
"Columnists were the bane of my life," she said. '"It
was almost impossible to get them to write on time or
to get them to stop squabbling in the pages of the
paper. If Ray Wissler (now the president of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce) wrote something one day, it
would be sure to be contradicted the next day by Elliot
Epsteen (now unheard of).
"On one occasion a eoluitm was shared by two writ
ers, who described themselves, for some unknown rea
son, as a walrus and a caterpiller. About half-way
through the quarter they had a fight on the fourth
floor of Sequoia Hall.
"It all started," she confessed cowly, "over a certain
girl ... In my younger days I was sometimes called,
well . . . ," she said.
"But they continued this ridicuolus fuss in the
columns of the newspaper, to the disgust of their read
ers, who were invited on Tuesday to take sides against
the Walrus and on Thursdays and Fridays to side
against the Caterpillar. As the Walrus had twice
the opportunity that the Caterpillar had, he soon gained
more partisans.
"But I preferred the Caterpillar," said Miss G. "He
was less able to express himself than the Walrus, who
was a student of the humanities, but in his slow, sullen
way he had a grasp of the right principle.
■ "The pen may be mightier than the sword but it was
the Caterpillar who won the fight, on the fourth floor of
Sequoia.
"He was a manly man," sighed Miss G. reminis
cently.
