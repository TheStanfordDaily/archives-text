Dear Editor:
I wish to express a rather tardy but very emphatic
approval of the Carpenter's article on peacetime con
scription. He certainly expressed his ideas better than
I could, but I still have a point to make.
It is certainly true that peacetime conscription in
itself will not prevent war or provide security: witness
the sad results of 150 years of European militarism. In
fact, there is a strong case for the view that such a
program will create a false feeling of security within
America, thus starting us down the rocky road of iso
lationism; or perhaps the reverse reaction of a pcace
which is "enforced by Uncle Sam"â€”which is a dis
guise for American imperialism.
Neither must we forget the effect of peacetime con
scription on the faith in American good will which has
been painfully built up in many foreign countries.
In short. I can see no easier way to insure another
war in the next generation than acceptance of the doc
trine that "an armed America is a free America."
Sincerely,
Kenneth Schug
