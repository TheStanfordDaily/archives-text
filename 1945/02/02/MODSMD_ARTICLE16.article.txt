Editor:
It is quite evident to us that the self-styled movie
critic who wrote the review of that epic, "Thirty Sec
onds Over Tokyo." was not long returned from an ex
tended sojourn at Bayshore or some similar place,
which would leave him in no position to comprehend,
much less review, a picture.
We feel that this show is a masterpiece of produc
tion. There was not one miscast part; and all players
turned in excellent performances. The photography,
close-up, and especially the aerial photography were
among the best of any taken last year; all this putting
aside the fact that the film portrays the actual expe
riences and sacrifices made by (he personnel involved.
Your critic's apparently distorted impression has
brought him wide disfavor; and, in our opinion, the
majority of his comments were entirely uncalled for.
Yours,
