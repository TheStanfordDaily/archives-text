ALLIED HQ., Luzon, Feb. 1 (UP).
—American Rangers and Filipino
guerillas struck 25 miles through
enemy lines Tuesday night, wiped
out the entire garrison of a Japa
nese prison camp in five blazing
minutes, and rescued 510 men of
Bataan, Corregidor and Singapore.
Gaunt men with deep lines etched
on gray faces, many too ill to walk,
and others clad only in their under
wear, were snatched from the filthy
prison stockade near Cabantuan, 60
miles north of Manila, at a time
when one rescued American officer
said the Japanese were about to vise
them as hostages.
Twenty-seven of the i-aiders were
killed and three wounded but they
killed 523 Japanese soldiers and de
stroyed 12 enemy tanks in a savage
battle with Japanese reinforcements
along the road home.
