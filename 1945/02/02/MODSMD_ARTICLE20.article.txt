# On the Discs
## 
### 
This week we're not discussing
musicians, just records, old, new and
those not even in the record stores
yet. Those to come are in this col
umn, so you can grab them when
and if they ever arrive on University
avenue.
First on our record list is the jazz
department and here we mention
the ones to come. Victor will release

sometime in
February eight
hot iazz albums,
featuring such
great musicians
and bands as:
Lionel Hampton,
Jelly Roll Mor-

ton. Louis Armstrong and McKin
ney's Cotton Pickers. The Morton
album will contain "Dead Man
Blues" and "Sidewalk Blues." You'd
better put your name down for one
now, or you'll still be hunting in
secondhand shops and scrap piles.
In the classical section we've
picked "Schererazade" by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra un
der Pierre Monteux (Victor), and
"The Peer Gynt Suite No. 1" by the
London Philharmonic under Sir
Thomas Beecham (Columbia). If
you're interested in Sir Thomas, this
week's issue of Life magazine con
tains a very interesting and informa
tive biography of him.
For swing addicts two great al
bums have just been reissued: Dcc
ea's "Five Feet of Swing" which in
cludes records by Bob Crosby, Dor
sey brothers, Glen Gray and the
Casa Lonia Band. Chick Webb and
Jinuny Dorsey; and Victor's "Sym
posium of Swing" featuring Tommy
Dorsey, Fats Waller, Bunny Berri
gan and Benny Goodman. Both are
available now so you'd better hurry,
or else.
For all bobby-soxers, Frankie's
latest is "I Dream of You" and "Sat
urday Night." Both of them show
Frankie at his best, if you like him.
Another record for sighing swoon
ers is "Don't You Notice Anything
New" and "What a Difference a Day
Makes" by Andy Russel (Capitol).
Last of the records of the week is
"Moonlight in Vermont" and "There
Goes That Song Again" by Billy But
terfield (Capitol). Margaret Whit
ting's vocal on "Vermont" is excep
tionally well done.
