# Strathairn from Hawaiian School
## 
### 
She was born in Hilo, Hawaii, at
tended Punahou School, will be
graduated from Stanford in June,
just three years after her arrival.
Last week she was elected president
of Women's Conference. Her name
is Pam Strathairn.
For three quarters a sponsor, Miss
Strathairn was president of Roble
summer quarter. Both in this ca
pacity and as president one quarter
of Casa Olivo in Lagunita, she has
attended Women's Conference, is
now auditing its meetings before
she takes office in spring.
On the theory of Conference
meetings, she says, "As much time
as possible should be devoted to dis
cussion at meetings—in this way
members will be truly representative
of the groups from which they come.
Wherever possible a balance should
be worked out between announce
ments and discussion. Perhaps house
meetings will pep up accordingly."
Similar suggestions have been made
by Sally Breuner, now Conference
president.
Of sponsoring, she said, "Not only
are sponsors valuable to the frosh;
sponsoring is of great value to up
perclassmen. More and more women
should try out for it."
When asked her reason for com
ing to Stanford, she said:
"My brother was in Stanford when
I came—but I always wanted to
come anyway."
