# Costigan Elected New Secretary
## 
### 
She's brunette, she's vivacious, and
she knows there is no place like
Stanford. She is Illie Costigan, new
ly elected secretary of the Freshman
Class.
This tiny, attractive girl hails from
Cal's doorstep. She has lived in
Berkeley all her life, but she has al
ways planned to attend Stanford.
Comparing Cal to the Farm, Illie
emphatically puts the Bears' spirit
behind the Indians'. "I like Stanford's
friendliness," she asserted.
Although Illie has not yet decided
on a major, her interests include art,
Spanish, and biology. At Berkeley
High School she won several draw
ing contests. She was also vice-presi
dent of the Girls' Association. Dra
matics is another field which has
entertained the versatile freshman.
She had a leading role in Berkeley
High's senior play and acted in other
productions as well.
Although Illie laughs a great deal
and shows a lively sense of humor,
she is very serious about the duties
of her office. "The class of 1948 is
large and has real possibilities; how
ever, it lacks unity," the new secre
tary declared. She pointed out that
this fault was clearly shown at the
first freshman rally of this quarter
which only a few members of the
class attended. Illie intends to work
for lively functions and better spirit.
