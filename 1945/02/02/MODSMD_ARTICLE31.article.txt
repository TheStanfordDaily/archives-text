j "Whether you're vice-president of
Conference, or a Roble sponsor, or a
worker on a comparatively insignifi
cant committee, it all comes down
to one thing—working for the Stan
ford spirit." Eleanor Marks, newly
elected to Women's Conference as
vice-president, was explaining her
program as an officer.
"Conference meetings, I think,
should be devoted to discussion of
current problems, suggested im
provements, and whatever gripes
living group representatives want to
bring up." "Marksie" had just re
turned from auditing Conference,
agreed with Sally Breuner that an
nouncements should be mimeo
graphed or printed in the Daily to
save Conference time for active dis
cussion.

majoring in poly sci, minoring in
I sponsoring. At present ensconced in 2
I Center, Roble, she confessed that
! sponsoring had been a half-dream
i ever since her freshman year.
"Sponsoring is wonderful—makes
you stop and remember all the
things about Stanford you've for
gotten since your freshman year."
J Before sponsoring, Marksie lived
! in Upper Eucalypto, Lagunita Court.
She plans to return in spring "if
there's a cubbyhole to put me in."
