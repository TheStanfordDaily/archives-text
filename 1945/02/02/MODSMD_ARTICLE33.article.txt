# Independents Favorites Over Chapel Tomorrow
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Out for their second win in North
ern California Basketball Associ
ation play, the Palo Alto Independ
ents will be slight favorites over
Chapel of the Oaks tomorrow night
in Kezar Pavilion at San Francisco.
The Oaks team, yet to win a game
in the N.C.B.A. tourney, are resting
in the circuit's cellar spot at the
present, but hope to leave that posi
tion with a win over the Independ
ents.
Dave Brown's team still possesses
the same individual stars that have
brought the squad through their re
cent successes. Starting at forwards
will be George Bower and Morley
Thompson, at center, Jack Heald,
and at guards Ed Douglas and
Brown.
Against San Bruno Navy and
Auten's, the Palo Altans relied on
Thompson and Douglas to do most
of the scoring. In those two games
they scored 47 points between them,
no mean feat. If these two boys are
hitting the hoop, the Independents
will be apt to run up quite a huge
score.
Brown and Heald Sturdy
Even though they do not contin
ually lead the scoring honors, Brown
and Heald appear to be the defensive
nucleus of the squad, Heald playing
superbly in front of the basket from
his pivot post. Both were mentioned
in the recent issue of the N.C.A.A.
basketball guide as the mainstays of
the "44 U.C.L.A. outfit.
Bower, a bit inactive in the last
few games, will find his opportunity
to show his typical brand of steady
playing, now that Bobby Rowe has
returned to active duty with the
Navy. Bower, a tall, good-looking
forward, is a capable partner for
Thompson at the other forward spot.
Reserves May Get To Play
The P.A.l.'s reserve strength may
ice again get a chance to show it
self if the proceedings are favorable.
Luke Pitts, Alan MacDowell. Horace
Chandler, Bob Rosberg, and Dick
Marquette form the second squad.


DAVE BROWN
. . . number two?
Several games in the Palo Alto
High gym are on tap within the next
few weeks, Brown said. He said that
the response of supporters for the
Auten's game was indication that
Stanford students want to see big
time basketball in this area.
