## 
### 
BERKELEY, Feb. 2.—California's
varsity cagers make their last home
appearance of the 1945 season tomor
row in the men's gymnasium in a
southern division return contest with
Southern California. The Bears, stag
ing a comeback after a mediocre
start, hope to stay in the title race
by defeating the league-leading
Trojans. Despite the 52-25 shellack
ing Troy dished out two weeks ago
in Los Angeles, Coach Nibs Price
figures his boys have a chance.
Price does not intend to repeat his
strategy of attempting to match S.C.'s
great height as he did last time; for
this combination proved totally in
capable of stopping the rampaging
Trojans. Instead, the Bear mentor

fast-breaking team that Saturday
night pasted College of the Pacific,
54-33.
Scoring Duel
The game may well become a scor
ing duel between S. C. center Jack
Nichols and Gus Mota, Cal's leading
scorer. Mota so far has the best aver
age of the two, averaging better than
13 points per game against Nichol's
nine per game.
Latest word from L. A. indicates
that Trojan Coach Bobby Muth has
adopted the unit system of substitu
tions, starting his tall team and send
ing in his smaller, fast-breaking
squad at crucial moments.
The varsity tipoff is scheduled for
8:30. Probable starting lineups ai-e:
S. C. Pos. Cal
Jack Morley F (ins Mota
Fred Moy F... George Clync
