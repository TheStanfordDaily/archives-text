## 
### 
Ted Mu m by's Palo Y.M.C.A,
wrestling group, composed mainly of
Stanford men, will enter inter-chap
ter competition again this Saturday,
when it meets a group of 10 Univer
sity of California service trainees
in the Jordan Jr. High gym in Pale
Alto at 2 p. m.
Representing Palo Alto will be
Bevier in the 13G-p oull d class;
Ponceford, Fox, Butt, Winter, Emer
son, Dickman, and Marquez in thi
155-pound class; Martinez, Kessel
heim, and Oscar Thompson in the
165-pound class; and Pitsker and J
C. Thompson in the heavyweight
class.
Since the California group, repre
senting the Berkeley "Y," has the
smaller squad, some of its best men
will wrestle two matches. Berkeley's
best men, according to Mr. Mumby,
are Ed Stanford at 136 pounds and
John Laughlin at 148. Stanford, a
winner in the Junior tourney in
Berkeley last month, will be opposed
by Bevier; while Laughlin reputed
I to be the Cal group's best, will fact
! Ponceford, Fox, or Butt. Best match
|of the afternoon will probably bt
that between Elrath and Oscar
Thompson of Stanford, Mr. Mumby
said. Elrath also won the junioi
tournament in Berkeley.
The meet is open to the public and.
there is no charge. Mr. Mumby and
i the Berkeley coach will probably
[ referee alternately.
