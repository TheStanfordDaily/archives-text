# Parlez-vous Francais? Query Lagunita Girls
## 
### BEV FRENCH 
International spirit and good cheer abound at Lagunita, particularly on
Wednesday, which is "language table" day.
Liigunita guests have been heard to exclaim when such phrases as
'"Passez-moi le cafe" and "Se hable Espangnol?" are tossed about with the
reckless abandon characteristic of the true lingiust.

* This amiable banter carried on in
a foreign language, frequently punc
tuated with a truly literate "Si" or
"Non," was begun last quarter by
the sponsors in response to a request
to revive the language table custom
.at "Lag."
Idea Acclaimed
The revival idea generated great
enthusiasm, and girls in each casa
were asked to sign sheets telling
what language they spoke and how
long they had spoken it.
Thene were those who signed, feel
ing confidant of their linguistic
prowess. Still others, however, af
fixed their signatures timidly, won-
I deling if they remembered enough
j high school French or Spanish to
' put one whole sentence together.
| Girls Approve
In spite of this trepidation, how
| ever, girls who have been at one of
I the tables agree with almost agres
sive unanimity that it's "great."
Claire Tolnay and Vicky Sellens,
in charge of the tables, appointed
! hostesses who keep the conversation
| going and admit no digressions into
j English.
At one table, an agreement was
1 made that any girl who spoke Eng
j lish would be forced to eat her des
! sert under the table. The plan
; worked, and French was spoken ex
clusively that day.
Hashers Get Confused
Jo Green and Barbara Beardsley,
hostesses, have little trouble main
taining conversation but are often
amused at the plight of hashers when
j confronted with drink slips bearing
! I's instead of m's ('"milk" equals
"lait" in French).
Disconcerted hashers have also
j been known to speak French at the
! Spanish table and Spanish at the
French tab 1 e, thereby confusing
: themselves more and adding to the
j general amusement of the table-sit-
I ters.
Portugese Confuses Girls
i Susan Webster, a Spanish-speaker
from way back, says that only once
! did the conversation get out-of
j hand and that occurred when Davie
| Keller, sitting at the Spanish table,
I began spurting Portuguese at an
1 alarming rate. General furor result
ed with bewildered girls wondering
"what (he heck she was talking
about." (One girl admitted that she
| Had immediately decided oit a quick
| Spanish refresher course.)
So far, says Davie, she has not
been invited to sit at another Spanish
table.
The language-tablers have dis
cussed plans to extend their activities
j and soon hope to be able to invite
I some language professors to sit with
them (they have a little brushing
j up to do) according to Vicky Sellens.
