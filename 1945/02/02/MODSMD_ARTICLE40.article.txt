# Koenig Lectures On Bird Sketches
## 
### 
Professor Frederick O. Koenig,
professor of Chemistry, yesterday
discussed the ornithological work
done by Alexander Wilson and John
James Audubon in its relation to the
American scientific activity carried
on in the years following the Ameri
can revolution at the American Stu
dies Symposium meeting.
He pointed out the American de
sire to be independent in scientific
achievement and the advancements
in the knowledge of birds made by
Wilson and even more notably by
Audubon. Wilson's work consisted
of several volumes of bird sketches
with which he flooded the market.
In Philadelphia Audubon had dif
ficulty marketing his lifesize water
colored sketches until they realized
the superiority of his craftmanship.
Professor Koenig's talk was the
second in the American Studies
Symposium being sponsored by the
School of Humanities. The next talk
will be given February 15 when
Desmond S. Powell, assistant profes
sor of Humanities, will speak on
American folklors. A special sym
posium meeting on governmental
agencies will be held the evening of
February 21.
