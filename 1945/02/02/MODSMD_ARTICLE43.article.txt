piece which the costume committee
bought for $1 at a clothing shop. "It
was a necessity in the play that she
wear a fox fur, so we had to get one
some way," Miss Wattenberger
laughed.

Johnny High is supposed to be a
fancy dresser. Every night he has to
have a fresh carnation for his but
tonhole. He also wears an overcoat

mittee bought a number of $1 Inger

Make-up will also be very pecu

liar. Instead of painting the usual
! big mouth, the women will have little
| rose-bud mouths.

Fur Neck Piece
Lorna Robertson who plays Clara,
the sister-in-law, wears a fur neck
piece which the costume committee
bought for $1 at a clothing shop. "It
was a necessity in the play that she
wear a fox fur, so we had to get one
some way," Miss Wattenberger
laughed.
Aubrey, the show off, played by
Johnny High is supposed to be a
fancy dresser. Every night he has to
have a fresh carnation for his but
tonhole. He also wears an overcoat
which has a huge fur collar'.
Since men in those days used
pocket watches, the costume com
mittee bought a number of $1 Inger
solls as a substitute.
Make-up will also be very pecu

liar. Instead of painting the usual
! big mouth, the women will have little
| rose-bud mouths.
