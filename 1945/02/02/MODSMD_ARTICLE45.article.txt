Folkmusic in the Third Platoon
It was as members of The Third
Platoon that we realized the versa
tility of music as a means of self-ex
pression. It soon became apparent
that each section of the country had
its own type of song for this self
expression.
It seems that for Dixie, every
mood of the day, every routine duty
had its counterpart in song. To best
illustrate this we will outline a typi
-1 day as we saw it.
On rising, the chief concern was
the latest war news. Bleary-eyed
and half-dressed, our buddies from
Georgia would chant, "Turn Your
Radio On, Turn Your Radio On."
With the morning preparations com
pleted the members of the company
were ready to move out for practi
cal work. And as they took off like
an R.D.. their destination became
quite obvious when all let out with
the ditty, "Way Down Yonder."
As noon approached, happy faces
anticipated mail call, the most im
portant event of any day. When
mail call was over, we could easily
guess each one's luck. The "forgot
ten" ones would wail the heart
rending refrain, "No Letter Today
Dear, I Waited So Long." The anxi
ous lovers, minus a reassuring letter,
would take pen in hand and while
writing, proclaim in song:
'Tin walking the floor over you,
I can't sleep a wink that is true.
I'm a-hopin' and a-prayin'
As my heart it breaks in two.
I'm walking the floor over you."
The majority, with beaming faces
and a letter from Patty Lou, would
harmonize "You Are My Sunshine,
My Only Sunshine."
As the boys inarched in from a
night problem, the full moon brought
back memories of pre-war night
problems, so enjoyable behind the
steering wheel instead of on foot,
;t they gave full vent to their feel
ings with the song "When My Blue
Turns to Gold Again."
Just before retiring, all thoughts
would turn homeward, and the last
sounds of the evening were the
strains of "Take That Night Train
to Memphis."
The lads from Brooklyn were dis
tinguished by their "gay" songs. One
of their favorites, which they thought
appropriate for any occasion was
"Many's the Night I've Spent With
Minnie the Mermaid Down at the
Bottom of the Sea."
Contrary to popular belief, the
men from Boston did consume 3.2.
They joined their pals from their
sister City of Culture, Philadelphia,
in the cultured adaptation, "Indicate
the way to my abode, I'm fatigued
and desire to retire." While on the
subject of the intelligentsia, we must
not forget the Engineers of the com
pany. who could always be heard
singing, "Casey Jones,"â€”"the story
of a brave engineer." In common
with all college men. they also in
cluded in their repertoire such songs

as "My Girl's From Vassal*, None
Can Surpass Her."
And so it goes on, each section of
the country claiming its songs typify
the American Youth. But extensive
research in the field enables us to
claim this honor for ourselves. Who
are we? We are members of the
Third Platoon.

Song of the week: "My Heart Be
longs to Manzanita."
* r.t *
A certain doctor at Dibble had
been pestered for many days by an
impatient G.I. who wanted to return
to the pleasant life at the "Farm".
Finally his patience snapped. After
the G.I. had asked the usual "Why
can't I go home, doc?" he turned with
a weary sheep-dog look and mut
tered, "Life is a trap."
