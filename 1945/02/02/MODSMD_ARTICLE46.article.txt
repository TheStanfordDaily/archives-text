# Meet the Men in The Daily Backshop
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
Bzzzz! Bzzzz! "Oh, it's 3:45," says
j the night editor as she rushes out
i to the backshop with copy. Then the
setting up of another day's Daily is
ready w begin.
The copy as it is turned in by the
| reporters and sent out to the back
i shop is set up on the linotype ma
chine. The Daily has a new linotype
j operator who has only been at Stan
[ ford for a few days. He is Lester
J Slaback who has just come from
working on the Portland "Journal"
eight years. When he is not working
i madly on his shift from 4 to 12 p. m.
| trying to get late stories set, he is
| pursuing his other interests, mainly
! golf and tennis.
Jones Foreman
M. E. Jones, composing-room fore
: man on the Daily, sets up the ads,
which are sent out earlier than the
! editorial copy. He also sets the hand
i set headlines, those which cannot
be set on the linotype machine. The
ads are set on the linotype and lud

low machines. The large display type
is the work of the ludlow machine.
Jones has one fourth of an acre
back of Menlo Park where he raises
pears and walnuts. He has four wal
nut trees and 25 pear trees, which
were once part of a large pear or
chard. "I have a lot of fun pruning
and spraying them and just looking
after them in general," Jones said.
Son in South Pacific
Jones' son. Lieutenant (j.g.) Wil
liam D. Jones, is a supply officer on
a destroyer somewhere in the South
Pacific. "He graduated from Cal!"
Jones laughed.
His wife operates a soda fountain
at Dibble Hospital for the patients
out there. Jones spends a lot of time
there when he is not on "duty" at
the Press.
The Daily unit is a separate unit
of the University Pr€>ss. Jones will
have worked on the Daily two years
this April.
When copy straggles in a little late,
Jones saves the Daily pocketbook

from a late issue by putting on Wil- j
bur Bailey at another linotype ma- ;
chine, setting up more headlines and
stories. He has been with the Uni- j
versity Press since 1925 and works
on the Daily only when extra help
is needed.
Bailey from Palo Alto
Bailey lives in Palo Alto. He likes
to read and study most everything, |
but especially likes to translate some j
of the Spanish plays (reading pro- j
ductions) that have been produced
here in the past.
Around 8:30 p. m. Mr. Jones starts
making up the pages. Although he
works under a serious handicap of
night editors, head copy editors and
associates continually asking him
questions or kidding him about his
new mustache, he doesn't seem to
mind it. And he always seems to
make the deadlines—lo:3o p. m. for
a small paper, and 12 midnight for a
large one.
Putting Baby to Bed
After the staff on duty has kissed

| the page proofs good-night, the
; paper is known as '"put to bed." The
| press men usually arrive at 1 or 2
! a. m., and the paper is printed some
where between 2 and 6 a. m.
Fred Jordan is in charge of the
[ newspaper press and is assisted by
j Frank Hellems. "It is a modern, up
| to-date press," Jones said, "and is
an eight-page Duplex newspaper
| press, the kind that is used by lots
of Dailies in the United States."
Berg Distributes Daily
Paul Berg of Buchanan and the
Business stall' distributes the papers
j every morning about 7 a. m. He
drives six miles every day to do this
j job so consequently gets a "B" card
i Tor it.
Jones, who is originally from Ohio
| and worked for a number of years
on the Toledo "Blade." said. "Natur
| ally the Daily is the best gotten-up
and printed college Daily I've seen."
However, he wouldn't say how many
! he'd seen.
