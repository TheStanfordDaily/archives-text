# New Thurber Anthology Promises To Be Popular
## 
### 
You might have planned to go to the Civ Libe, to Mrs. Tresidder's tea,
or to the Vocom meeting until you picked up the most seditious treatise
against organied enterprise published this year, the Thurber Carnival.
Now James T. is a nice man who means well, but his characters get
out of control. They wander right out of the pages of his book and beckon

j you, the reader, to follow, which you
j clo because you are drawn after
| his bewildered Walter Mittys just
j like a little boy stumbling after a
| lovable but pathetic puppy.
After you've read a couple of these
. stories you will tenderly remember
! certain friends of yours who were
not created for modern life—a friend
j of mine used to collect extracted
teeth from his dentist, touch them
up with niercurochronie and carry
them around in his vest pocket so
that when things got dull at the
gatherings society forced him to at
tend. he would unobtrusively drop a
bloody tooth into his hostess's tea
cup, purely for the servants' glee.
There is a story patterned after the
I "Will to Conquer Life," called "De
structive Forces in Life," which
calmly points out a few holes in
| modern psychology. Bert Scursey
I would make an interesting research
| problem for psych majors. His story
starts with a telephone call which
goes this way: "But for some strange
| reason, when Louise Connor an-
I swered, Scursey found himself pre
| tending to be, and imitating the voice
of a colored woman . . ."
Even though you don't exactly
hate biology, the lab periods may
give you the same mysterious troub
les that Thurber poignantly describes
in "University Days." He had trouble
in ccon, too.
If a faculty wile who thinks she
j has had maid trouble should glance
: down this column, I think it would
! be nice if she turned to page 207 and
met Dora Gedd, the mousey type
i who recited Shakespeare, after shoot
j ing the man who intruded upon the
privacy of the servant's quarters—
And Gertie Straub, a robust girl who
! collected pints of rye between rounds
of dusting.
The Stanford Bookstore is offer
ing a complete antidote for all its
textbooks in this one volume of short
stories, verse, and drawings by
James Thurber, some of which have
never been published before.
