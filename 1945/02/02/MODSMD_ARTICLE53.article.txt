# New Student Honeysett Takes Law with Humor
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
Interesting, humorous typifies one j
of the Law Department's graduate
students, and assistant to Jordan
Peckham, head of Men's Vocom, !
Crane Honeysett. Honeysett is new
*o the campus, this being his second i
quarter, and he lives in San Mateo j
with his wife.
Before San Mateo he lived in San
Francisco and received his degree in
Public Administration at Berkeley
in 1941. Then, after leaving the Uni
versity of California, he became a
cadet in the Air Corps. Just prior
to his arrival at Stanford he was

employment representative to the
War Manpower Commission in San
Francisco.
Hom-Kimmcd Glasses
An object of immediate curiosity
about this personable gentleman is
his tremendous pair of horn-rimmed
glasses, which, according to Honey
sett, not only aid him in delving
into the cost complicated law annals,
but hold up in intramural basket
ball as well.
Some of Honeysett's hobbies are
fiction writing and an interest in
playing the races. With philosophy
as his mam hobby, he states his in
terest in "the philosophy of law,"
and in the "applications of these
principles involved."
Discussing the subject of law as a
profession, one of Honeysett's col
leagues, Stanley Keller, observed
that "Law is always trying to keep
up with changing customs and eth
ics"â€”and then, as a humorous after
thought, "But you have to be crazy
to be a lawyer."
All Kidding Aside
Keller, an ardent law student, and
a character of no slow wit himself,
remarked that Honeysett "voted for
Roosevelt and was a champion of
the underdog." Honeysett would di
vulge little else on his law opinions,
saying that he "didn't want to ap
pear as thrust in front of the public";
to which Keller replied that "it
would look more like he tripped."
Both Keller and Honeysett, along
with their classmate associates, have
termed themselves the "Junior Gen
iuses," and further attributing to
their humorous attitude, Honeysett
claimed that Jarvis, another law
student, "had the greatest collection
of erroneous information in the
United States."
