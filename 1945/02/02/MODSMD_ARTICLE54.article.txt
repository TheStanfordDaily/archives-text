# Mrs. Sterling Discusses Best Sellers at Bookstore
## 
### GRETA SIEMENS 
Getting Mrs. Helen C. Sterling,
manager of the book department of
the Stanford Bookstore, to show us
this week's book list was not as dif
ficult as we first imagined it would
be. After dashing from the Cellar to
the Bookstore three afternoons in a
row and finding a vacant chair as
the only evidence of the existence of
such a person, we were at last re
warded by not only meeting Mrs.
Sterling, but also hearing the "sto
ries behind the stories" of several
of the newest—or eventual—addi
tions to the store's supply of "best
sellers."
Heading her list of non - fiction
editions was "Black Boy," the auto
biography of Richard White, negro
author "Native Son." Mrs. Ster
ling praised it by saying that this
book is "one of the greatest auto
biographies I have ever read—black
or white." She added that it is
"powerfully written ... it doesn't
pull punches; yet, it is so exquisitely
beautiful in parts that it is almost
like a negro spiritual."
Also highly recommended by Mrs.
Sterling are two books that will be
published in March, "Boats of Mel
ody" and "Ancestor's Brocades."
"Boats of Melody" is Harper's col
lection of six hundred fifty poems of
Emily Dickenson's that have never
before been published. "Ancestor's
Brocades" explains the reason for
the delay in the publication of these
poems, which Mrs. Sterling, in turn,
explained to us.
Upon the death of Emily Dicken
son, her sister and a friend, Mrs.
Todd, selected the poems of Miss
Dickenson's to be used for publica
tion. In 1890 these poems appeared
in print. In the meanwhile, Miss
Dickenson's brother, Austin, dis
agreed with his sister over the lit
erary inheritance, and prevented the
printing of some of her poems until
now. Recently, Mrs. Todd and her
daughter got access to those poems
that had never been published, and
these are the six hundred fifty that
will appear next month in "Boats of
Melody."
Feeling that we had intruded upon
the private feuds of the famous, but
at the same time knowing a "scoop"
when we hear it, we efficiently and
stealthily gathered up our notes
and chewed pencils and started to
ward the door. Just then. Mrs. Ster
ling found another item of interest.
It seems that another great piece
of literature that will be available
this month is H. L. Mencken's "Sup
plement to the American Language."
Mrs. Sterling explained that only
10,000 copies of this book would be
printed, and then the plates would
be destroyed. The reason for this is
that since Mr. Mencken does not
wish any possible errors on his part
to be perpetuated, no more copies
of the book should be in circulation.
In fact, there is a great possibility
that the whole work may be revised
and republished.
Before we finally tore ourselves

away from the interview, Mrs. Ster
ling mentioned Edna Ferber's latest
book, "Great Son," as being "some
thing slightly different—for Ferber—
and good."
And then, as a final triumph, Mrs.
Sterling let fall the immortal words
that a former Stanford student has
written a book which will be pub
lished this month. Mrs. Shelley
Smith Mydans, a student at Stanford
between 1932 and 1934, has written
a book about her treatment in a
Japanese internment camp entitled
"The Open City." Mrs. Mydans and
her husband Carl are correspond
ents and photographers to Life and
Time magazines and were confined
several years ago by the Japanese
in the Philippines.
And so, staggering under the
weight of such knowledge as we now
had, we hurried to get to a type
writer so that we could tell you that
all these books are, or soon will be,
in the Stanford Bookstore. Look for
them!
