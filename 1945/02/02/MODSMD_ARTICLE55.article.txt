# Mist Migrates, Saturates Farm
## 
### LORRY [illegible]LOKEY 
Everyone shook in their beds early
yesterday morning as a result of the
37-mile-an-hour wind.
Insult was added to injury when,
as everyone got up and prepared to
leave for their classes, a light mist
began the process of thoroughly
saturating the campus —• with the
help of the gentle wind.
Ben Bok, the mad drummer of
Toyon, claimed that there is nothing
sickly about any ill wind that wakes
him from his beauty sleep.
Asked if he had ever seen more
rain anywhere at any time, Pat Phil
lips said, "Show me the way to L.A."
It is unknown as to what happened
to the far-sighted student who rris
took the Lake for another puddle
and tried to wade through it. On the
other hand, two broken legs were
the result when a near-sighted stu
dent mistook a puddle for the Lake,
donned the proper swimming attire,
and jumped in.
Aside from these tall-tales for a
moment ,now for an interesting fact.
Many of you probably saw the ex
cellent rainbows yesterday morning
and afternoon—or at least you saw
one half of them.
If you were to consult Wonders of
Science, Simplified ($1.98 and two
Wheaties box tops), you would read
the following:
"When the horizon does not get
in the way, a rainbow is seen as a
full circle of color. But from an air
plane high above the clouds, the
rainbow can be seen as a large circle
of color. The plane's reflection, more
over, is seen in the center of this
circle." (No wonder Superman hasn't
a pocket mirror.)
