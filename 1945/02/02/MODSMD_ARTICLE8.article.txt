# Entertainment, Soft Music at Toyon Formal
## 
### 
Final plans for the Toyon formal,
Sweetheart Time, were being com
pleted today in preparation for the
dance tomorrow at 9 p. m. All the
available bids for the formal were
sold out Tuesday, and Toyon Club
has announced that there would ab
solutely be no tickets sold at the
door.
Playing for the dance is Benny
Glassman and his 16-piece San Jose
orchestra. Benny's orchestra features
sweet and soft music according to
reports from the Garden City.
Refreshments will be served
throughout the evening, and a prom
ised feature will be the intermission
entertainment.
With the Sweetheart Time theme
being highly emphasized, decorations
will feature large cupid's hearts and
soft blue lights. A large cupid's heart
completely covering the main en
trance to the dance floor, will be a
feature of the decorative scheme.
Responsibility for the planning of
the dance lies in the hands of Jack
Pearson and his seven-man commit
tee consisting of Jack Gilliland, Bob
Ayres, Bill Keeler, Gordon Levy, Pat
Phillips and Dave Saunders.
