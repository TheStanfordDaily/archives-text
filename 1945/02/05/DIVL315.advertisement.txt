TOUR HEALTH
9 The purity and uniformity of the
drugs and chemicals we use in com
pounding your physician's prescription
are ensured by the vigilant chemists of
Control Laboratories. Even during the
manufacture of a simple product a score
or more of exacting tests for purity are
made. Thus, we compound prescription*
with full confidence in the reliability of
the ingredients your physician prescribes.
