# ‘Road Back'—Yanks in Manila

### 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, LUZON, Monday, Feb. 5 (UP)—
General Douglas Mac Arthur's avenging American troops re
turned to Manila Saturday night, freeing thousands of Ameri
can and British internees at the Santo Tomas concentration
camp and smashing into the heart of the city to capture the
Philippines' presidential palace.

Mac Arthur established temporary headquarters on the
northern outskirts to direct personally the complete liberation
of the city. A strong force of Japanese soldiers and marines
was expected to make a suicidal defense of the lower half of
the city, south of the wide Pasig river.

But the American flag flew over the Philippines' capital
today and Japanese resistance in the northern or modern part
1 of the city was limited to harassing and sniping fire.
Major General Vern D. Mudge's veteran First Cavalry regu
lars won the race for Manila which began 26 days before on
in Lingayan Gulf beachhead 107 miles to the north. In a
dramatic envelopment maneuver climaxing a 100 mile advance
in 36 hours, they streaked into the city from the east in dark
ness and raced through the modern city to the Pasig river
which flows through the center of the capital.
At the same time, Major General Robert S. Beighler's 37th
Division, moving from the northwest, broke into the northern
suburbs. The 37th and First cavalrymen seized the great air
drome on Manila's outskirts.
On the south, Major General Joseph Swing's Eleventh Air
borne Division in its first parachute operation of the Philippines
campaign, seized Tagaytay municipality, 28 miles south of Ma
nila, and moved swiftly northward.
