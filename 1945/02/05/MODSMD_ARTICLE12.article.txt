# Pow-Wow Offers Prizes
## 
### 
Best chance of winter quarter for
an all-Stanford get-together is be
ing offered by Ram's Head in its
Pow-VVow Talent Show, according to
Show Supervisor Peggy Fitts. Set for
March 2 in Memorial Auditorium, it
is open only to Stanford students
and faculty, presented by whatever
groups have submitted their names
and ideas to Miss Fitts before Feb
ruary 16.
Already declaring themselves as
entries in the race for the three
Ram's Head prizes—for best done,
funniest, most original—, students
are anxious for faculty groups to
volunteer their talent for the gen
eral entertainment.
Suggestions for groups as entries
are: members of campus clubs, hash
er groups, living groups, poly sci
classmates, dinner table cliques.
Suggestions for acts: impersona
tions of famous people (remember
Frank Sinatra in last year's Gaie
ties?) take-offs on various phases
of campus life, original songs, dance
displays, dramatic and comedy skits.
Entertainment of each group is
limited to 8 minutes; costumes and
props are restricted to those that can
be carried on and off-stage with the
act.
Lines are already forming to the
telephones — Miss Fitts may be
reached at 22151, and appointments
for rehearsals in the Memorial Audi
torium whenever necessary may be
arranged by calling Mary Lou Pat
ton at Jessie Jordan House.
