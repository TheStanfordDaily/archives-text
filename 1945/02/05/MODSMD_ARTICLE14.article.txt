# Zimmerman-Schein Grand Slam To Victory in Bridge Tourney
## 
### 
Herb Zimmerma n and Jerry |
Schein breathed a simultaneous sigh
of relief, collected two Roos Broth
er's boxes from Marge Troy, and
walked out of the Nitery—victors in
the Cardinal's all-campus bridge
tournament. Opponents Leonard Low
and Jim "I've been misquoted"
Weinberg congratulated the winners
and withdrew, already trying to
trade second prizes.
Climax to the five-rubber final
play-off was the grand slam in dia
monds made by julnerables Zim
merman and Schein, shoving them
from their position 1700 points be-
Uind into a 400-point lead. From then
until Low flung his cards resignedly
on the table during the last rubber,
the winning combination surged
steadily ahead, piling up 5070 points
to their opponent's 3000.
Throughout the finals, a motionless
ring of kibitzers was heard com

menting in whispers at the close bid
ding, or betting with conviction on
who would win. The players volun
teered each card with caution, and
four pairs of eyes, above four pairs
of glasses, watched the tricks pile up
on the table. None of them spoke,
except occasionally to check their
progress with scorer Johnny High.
The winners, upon opening their
prizes — for Zimmerman a wind
breaker like the one he was wear
ing, for Schein a girl's raspberry
Braemer sweater —were overheard
making a date to exchange them at
Roos Brothers. "Really fine prizes,"
they said, "just a little inappro
priate."
Low made off with a tan sports
shirt from Phelps-Terkel, while j
Weinberg stuffed a gold key-chain '
from T. C. Christy Co. and a leather
key-case from Wideman's in his j
pocket. *

Stanford's women, eliminated from
the tournament before the semi
finals, could not even claim the
booby-title which went to Chuck
Letts and Lin Miller. As they opened
the two pairs of gay Roos Brother's
suspenders. Lin said. "They're ex
quisite" for the benefit of the press.
Marge Troy, chairman of the
I tournament, was surprised that no
women reached the finals. "All the
beautiful prizes, intended for the
women, had to be exchanged." Long
hours of playing in women's living
j groups apparently doesn't bring on
expertness at bridge, although it's
undeniably useful in postponing
study-time, she commented.
Semi-finalists were Marvin Sha-
I piro and Jim Burnell, who lost to
j the tournament winners, Bill Aik
| man and Ralph Buffington, who
I conceded the finals spot to Weinberg
i and Low.

Marge Troy, chairman of the
I tournament, was surprised that no
women reached the finals. "All the
beautiful prizes, intended for the
women, had to be exchanged." Long
hours of playing in women's living
j groups apparently doesn't bring on
expertness at bridge, although it's
undeniably useful in postponing
study-time, she commented.
Semi-finalists were Marvin Sha-
I piro and Jim Burnell, who lost to
j the tournament winners, Bill Aik
| man and Ralph Buffington, who
I conceded the finals spot to Weinberg
i and Low.
Herb Zimmerma n and Jerry |
Schein breathed a simultaneous sigh
of relief, collected two Roos Broth
er's boxes from Marge Troy, and
walked out of the Nitery—victors in
the Cardinal's all-campus bridge
tournament. Opponents Leonard Low
and Jim "I've been misquoted"
Weinberg congratulated the winners
and withdrew, already trying to
trade second prizes.
Climax to the five-rubber final
play-off was the grand slam in dia
monds made by julnerables Zim
merman and Schein, shoving them
from their position 1700 points be-
Uind into a 400-point lead. From then
until Low flung his cards resignedly
on the table during the last rubber,
the winning combination surged
steadily ahead, piling up 5070 points
to their opponent's 3000.
Throughout the finals, a motionless
ring of kibitzers was heard com

menting in whispers at the close bid
ding, or betting with conviction on
who would win. The players volun
teered each card with caution, and
four pairs of eyes, above four pairs
of glasses, watched the tricks pile up
on the table. None of them spoke,
except occasionally to check their
progress with scorer Johnny High.
The winners, upon opening their
prizes — for Zimmerman a wind
breaker like the one he was wear
ing, for Schein a girl's raspberry
Braemer sweater —were overheard
making a date to exchange them at
Roos Brothers. "Really fine prizes,"
they said, "just a little inappro
priate."
Low made off with a tan sports
shirt from Phelps-Terkel, while j
Weinberg stuffed a gold key-chain '
from T. C. Christy Co. and a leather
key-case from Wideman's in his j
pocket. *

Stanford's women, eliminated from
the tournament before the semi
finals, could not even claim the
booby-title which went to Chuck
Letts and Lin Miller. As they opened
the two pairs of gay Roos Brother's
suspenders. Lin said. "They're ex
quisite" for the benefit of the press.
