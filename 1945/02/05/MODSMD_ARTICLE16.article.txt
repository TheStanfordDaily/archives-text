# THREE UNITS OF FLUFF

### 
There is more to be said about education in regard to
'.ho article we quoted last week from the Scientific
Monthly, concerning the slow recognition by scientists
themselves of the fact that science can never supply
answers about values and ends, while weaknesses in
the liberal arts continue to stand in the way of sound
learning.
Another aspect of current tendencies is expressed in
an idea from the same article:
' The broader reaches of any subject under heaven
can be intelligently discussed by intelligent people;
and when the specialist resorts to jargon, he is proving
his own lack of education and arousing suspicion as
to the essential value of his subject, for it is notorious
that the most specious subjects in the curriculum are
most riddled with technical jargon and tools."
Any thoughtful student has discovered this sort of
tendency in his college experience; some even like it
because mastery of the jargon provides an inside tract
on a brand of "knowledge" that fools a few people.
An even worse tendency students tolerate is, how
ever, the new hypnotized-by-own-ideas type of in
struction. Interpretation is one thing, but amateur "im
pressions" as substitutes for scholarly criticism are a
body blow at an institution of higher learning.
Vacuous words pass too easily for learning because
it is true that scholars who spend their lives doing
research have expected the resulting facts to speak
for the subject without need of emotional appeal. Con
sequently, the emotional individualism recently intro
duced into teaching has won undue consideration as
something new and different.
Scholars in many instances have allowed this to
happen by indulging in the attitude that their hours
>112 research are more important than hours spent in
structing students of supposedly inferior intelligence.
The fact remains that although no soap company will
subsidize them or tooth powder support their graduate
students, the liberal arts will remain a vital part of
•very man's education. In addition, the private institu
ion will be called upon to face a "vigorous survival
>112 the fittest" in the tax-burdened years after the war.
It will not be able to slide by on counterfeits and sub
•ututes.
This business of being educated takes too many years
>t our lives, what we must determine in it is true and
raise, and then say something about it. We all influence
>ur friends concerning their courses and their worth;

we must also remember the responsibility that we now
have in establishing the kind of education on which
our "alma mater" will base its reputation after we
leave.

body blow at an institution of higher learning.
Vacuous words pass too easily for learning because
it is true that scholars who spend their lives doing
research have expected the resulting facts to speak
for the subject without need of emotional appeal. Con
sequently, the emotional individualism recently intro
duced into teaching has won undue consideration as
something new and different.
Scholars in many instances have allowed this to
happen by indulging in the attitude that their hours
>112 research are more important than hours spent in
structing students of supposedly inferior intelligence.
The fact remains that although no soap company will
subsidize them or tooth powder support their graduate
students, the liberal arts will remain a vital part of
•very man's education. In addition, the private institu
ion will be called upon to face a "vigorous survival

There is more to be said about education in regard to
'.ho article we quoted last week from the Scientific
Monthly, concerning the slow recognition by scientists
themselves of the fact that science can never supply
answers about values and ends, while weaknesses in
the liberal arts continue to stand in the way of sound
learning.
Another aspect of current tendencies is expressed in
an idea from the same article:
' The broader reaches of any subject under heaven
can be intelligently discussed by intelligent people;
and when the specialist resorts to jargon, he is proving
his own lack of education and arousing suspicion as
to the essential value of his subject, for it is notorious
that the most specious subjects in the curriculum are
most riddled with technical jargon and tools."
Any thoughtful student has discovered this sort of
tendency in his college experience; some even like it
because mastery of the jargon provides an inside tract
on a brand of "knowledge" that fools a few people.
An even worse tendency students tolerate is, how
ever, the new hypnotized-by-own-ideas type of in
struction. Interpretation is one thing, but amateur "im
pressions" as substitutes for scholarly criticism are a
body blow at an institution of higher learning.
