## WHY DON'T THEY. . . ? 
### MARY AL SMITH 
. . . change Folk Dancing T. TH. F. at 8 a. m. to Folk
Dancing T. TH. F. at .10 a. m.
. . . raise the ceiling on the little green bus. Maybe
the government could do something about this. They've
raised the ceiling on everything else.
. . . muzzle the frogs in Lagunita Lake. The muh
muhing oaks are complaining about the competition.
. . . tell us what goes on in the Hoover Tower besides
the light^,
. . . have Jean Parker and her construction crew mend
some of the campus roads. Especially that bad stretch
between 395 and 397 Salvatierra.
. . . abolish pop quizzes.
. . . have more meetings of the Jun-i-or Thunder
Riders. We have so few all-campus functions.
. . . abolish all quizzes.
. . . install a network of rafts which would run down
the Row totheP.O.where it would connect with a raft
escalator from Lagunita and Roble. Well-equipped with
water repellant awnings and cigarettes, these rafts
would leave every 10 minutes for the History corner;
those students and professors bound for inner Quad
stations could enraft and deraft along the route. An
Encina extension could also be built by slave labor
imported from Cal. Of course, this project must be kept
very hush-hush, as the Alto Palto Chamber of Com
merce isn't aware that it does rain in California.
. . . serve three meals on Sundays in most University
dining halls.
. . . take down those blackout bonnets on the lights
in the Main Libe. It would make it easier to tabulate
"footsie" scores.
. . . restore the pre-war status of the cinch course.
. . . distribute copies of the Daily—the Farm's Only
Home-grown Newspaper—in each P. O. box. Then no
one would have to go "mail-less."
. . . put cartoons in Contemporary Source Books.
Howsabout it, '48? This is one way to go "down" in
History.
. . . offer a more complete coverage of the Ding-Dong
Daddy case. .
. . . change Folk Dancing T. TH. F. at 8 a. m. to Folk
