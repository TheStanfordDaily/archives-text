Manila has been entered, and this should not be much
of a surprise. We have been on a victory march, un
opposed, in the south, but the fighting is still hard in
the north.
As was mentioned in this column, the Japanese prob
ably concentrated everything they had in the rugged
north country. The south was left devoid of troops,
since it was undefensible and useless.
General Mac Arthur seems to have started his in
vasion with three Army corps. Two were pinned down
by enemy action in the north, while the third was able
to push south after an enemy counterattack was broken
up.
Yet, the battle of Luzon is still only a matter of time.
General Yamoshito weakened its garrison too much
to defend Leyte. If he had looked on Leyte as a flank
guard bastion, to be held lightly and long enough to
move everything north to Luzon, he might have been
able to hold out for a much longer period, but he tried
to fight his big battle on Leyte with disastrous results.
The Japanese Navy has tried to reorganize itself and
open a supply line with Formosa, but its attempt seems
to have been broken up near its ports in Indo-China.
Thus the weak Luzon garrison can only fight to the
bitter end. If it had been really strong enough for a
rousing defense, it could have put so much pressure on
the northern end of Lingayen salient that General Mac-
Arthur wouldn't have dared go south to Manila after
a full scale battle.
It is very likely that Luzon can be written off now,
but the fighting in the north will be very long and very
bitter, possibly even very bloody.
