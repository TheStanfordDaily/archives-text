To the Editor:
I should like to make a suggestion which I believe to I
be of vital interest and importance 1o the education
and morale, not only of myself, but also of many others
of the Stanford student body.
Having recently gotten stuck, due to no fault of my
own, in the Cactus Gardens on a rainy night, resulting
in: (1) a lockout, the third by the way; (2) muddy tires. j
pants, skirls, and a certain red coat; (!5) considerable :
embarrasment on the part of us both; and (4) the dis- j
turbance of the blissful slumbers of a certain House
mother—l wish to suggest, even to beg, that all roads |
in the vicinity of the Cactus Garden lie paved immedi- '
ately. (At least before Friday night). R.T.T.C.G.
Sincerely yours,
Jack Siemer, Tyler Halt. '
