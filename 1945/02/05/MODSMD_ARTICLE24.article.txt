# Independents Lose To Chapel of Oaks
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Paced by Ken Leslie, an all-city basketeer in San Francisco last year,
the Chapel of the Oaks squad racked up its first win in Northern Cali
fornia Basketball Association play yesterday afternoon with a last-minute
victory over the Palo Alto Independents, 41-38. The contest, previously
billed for Saturday night, was played before a genial crowd in San Fran-

Cisco's Kezar Pavilion, and saw the'
Independents lead until the last 2
minutes of play.
It was Leslie who broke up the tie
with two successive free tosses, and
it was Leslie who walked off with
high point honors, tallying 18 points
throughout the afternoon. Dave
Brown and Morley Thompson, the
latter a member of last year's all-S.
F. mythical team, led the Palo Altans
with 11 digits each.
Lead at Half
The Independents found them
selves on the long end of the score
soon after the game began, after
Thompson had swished the netting
for four points. With Brown and
George Bowers, forward, popping
them in, the Independents led 19-15
at the rest period.
With the beginning of the second
half, Joe Thurston, at present star
ring for Lowell High in San Fran
cisco, found his eye and counted
nine points for the Chapel. Leslie,
an alumnus of Lowell also, kept hit
ting the bucket, and paid off with
his last-minute points.
Brown's Independent squad found
the Chapel sharpshooters a bit too
hard to handle even though center
Jack Heald found the range for
eight counters in the second half.
Thompson, usually a last-half play
er, could only shove one field goal
and two free throws through the
rim in the second stanza.
In his usual rough-and-tumble

style, Brown was ejected on five
personals by the stern reffing of Art
j Free, who called 2G fouls in the game.
This was the third loss for the
j Independents against one win in the
1 NCBA tourney. It marked the
j Chapel's first league win to date.
