# Matmen Whipped By Berkeley ‘Y’
## 
### BY BERKELEY ‘Y’ 
Coach Ted Mumby's Palo Alto Y.
M.C.A. wrestling group, composed
mostly of Stanford men, lost out to
the University of California squad in
their second inter-chapter meet held
at the Jordan Junior High gym last
Saturday afternoon. The California
group, representing the Berkeley
"Y", was made up almost entirely of
naval trainees, who managed to turn
the tables on the Paly matmen who
had beaten them in the initial en
counter last week.
Tom Winter, in the 13G-pound
class, and Oscar Thompson, in the
165-pound class, were the only win
ners from the local group. Because
the Berkeley squad was the smaller
of the two groups, their stars, Laugh
-1 in, Elrath, and Stanford, fought
twice.
Stanford men who participated in
the meet were: Ponceford, Fox, Butt.
Winter, Emerson, Dickman, Marquez,
Martinez, Kesselheim, O. Thompson,
Pitsker, and J. C. Thompson.
