# Britt Trio Is Contrast In Style, Performance
## 
### 
Providing contrasts both in their methods of presentation and in their
selections, the Britt String Trio, second offering of the Concert Series'
1944-45 season, played Friday night in Memorial Hall to a large audience
anxious to see how this relatively unknown group would acquit itself.
An experienced and accomplished cellist, Horace Britt, best known of

of the three and organizer of the
trio a year ago, delighted the audi
ence with the beautiful tone of his
instrument. Britt has played with
the San Francisco Symphony and
has toured the United States, Cana
da, and South America both as a
performer and conductor.
Play Less-Known Pieces
Carrying out their promise to play
less well-known pieces of famous
composers, the trio delivered Bee
thoven's "Trio in G Major," Opus
9, No. 1; "Serenade" Opus 10 by
Dohnanyi; and Brahms' "Trio in C
Minor" Opus 101.
The "Trio in G Major" was typical
Beethoven, and seemed inferior to
his better known chamber music.
Viola Wasterlain's violin in this
number was outbalanced by the
wer-loud cello and viola; and her
touch was not firm enough, giving
her delivery a fuzzy, even out-of
tune effect. This was somewhat com
pensated for in the last movement
which was very well done and had
more body than most trios.
Vague Melody
The Dohnanyi "Serenade," second
selection on the progra m, was
marked by a vague, wandering

melody in the second movement
which proved a little light. This
movement, with its pizzicato accom
paniment was somewhat inferior;
but the latter movements were ac
complished with technical and melo
dic finesse.
Completing the program was the
Brahms number, by far the most
outstanding of the three. The f trio
seemed to enjoy playing and this
spirit found itself in their delivery.
Conrad Held substituted the piano
for his viola in this piece and per
formed with credit, as he had
throughout the evening. Britt's cello
was particularly outstanding here,
although violin again seemed to be
off tune.
Encores Inferior
As encore numbers the trio offered
a couple of semi-classical pieces
which they played with spirit and
bravado; although relatively diffi
cult the encores were inferior com
positions and detracted from the fine
impression of the Brahms selection.

touch was not firm enough, giving
her delivery a fuzzy, even out-of
tune effect. This was somewhat com
pensated for in the last movement
which was very well done and had
more body than most trios.
Vague Melody
The Dohnanyi "Serenade," second
selection on the progra m, was
marked by a vague, wandering

melody in the second movement
which proved a little light. This
movement, with its pizzicato accom
paniment was somewhat inferior;
but the latter movements were ac
complished with technical and melo
dic finesse.
Completing the program was the
Brahms number, by far the most
outstanding of the three. The f trio
seemed to enjoy playing and this
spirit found itself in their delivery.
Conrad Held substituted the piano
for his viola in this piece and per
formed with credit, as he had
throughout the evening. Britt's cello
was particularly outstanding here,
although violin again seemed to be
off tune.
Encores Inferior
As encore numbers the trio offered
a couple of semi-classical pieces
which they played with spirit and
bravado; although relatively diffi
cult the encores were inferior com
positions and detracted from the fine
impression of the Brahms selection.

Providing contrasts both in their methods of presentation and in their
selections, the Britt String Trio, second offering of the Concert Series'
1944-45 season, played Friday night in Memorial Hall to a large audience
anxious to see how this relatively unknown group would acquit itself.
An experienced and accomplished cellist, Horace Britt, best known of

of the three and organizer of the
trio a year ago, delighted the audi
ence with the beautiful tone of his
instrument. Britt has played with
the San Francisco Symphony and
has toured the United States, Cana
da, and South America both as a
performer and conductor.
Play Less-Known Pieces
Carrying out their promise to play
less well-known pieces of famous
composers, the trio delivered Bee
thoven's "Trio in G Major," Opus
9, No. 1; "Serenade" Opus 10 by
Dohnanyi; and Brahms' "Trio in C
Minor" Opus 101.
The "Trio in G Major" was typical
Beethoven, and seemed inferior to
his better known chamber music.
Viola Wasterlain's violin in this
number was outbalanced by the
wer-loud cello and viola; and her
touch was not firm enough, giving
her delivery a fuzzy, even out-of
tune effect. This was somewhat com
pensated for in the last movement
which was very well done and had
more body than most trios.
