Conference me m be r s discussed

Stanford's system of war work and
will discuss it further next week
when Jeannctte Grimsley, Stanford
War Board Coordinator, can attend.
Hospitals for wounded servicemen
greatly appreciate having girls go
out and entertain their men. "The
girls seem to enjoy doing this too,"
Sally Breuner, president of Women's
Conference said.
Knitters and Nurses Aides do the
most war work on the campus. There
is a great lack of enthusiasm for
jobs such as surgical dressings. Sug
gestions were made that Stanford
do away with war work pledges
completely and have all war work
voluntary.
Washington's birthday, February
22, will be a holiday, but February
2.'5 will be a regular school day.
Two guides for tours of the Hoover
War Library are needed every
other-week on Friday from 3 to 5
p. m. The job consists mainly of
running elevators. Anyone interested
should call Barbara White, ASSU
president.
