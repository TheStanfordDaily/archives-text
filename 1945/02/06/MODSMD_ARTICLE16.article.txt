# Whither Are We Drifting?â€”or-This Does It!

Occasionally in the august realms of scholar
ship beyond the proletariat, such bewitching
gcings-on go on that even the hoi polloi of stu
dent circles must take note and marvel at the
marvels of science.
Such an event occurred, as related by Time
Magazine of January 8, when discussing the
work of Mr. Arnold Gesell of Yale; it probes
in its bumptious way into the studies he has
done on the human mind before birth. Liberal
minded people that we are, we are willing to
grant Mr. Gesell freedom to pursue the study
of fetuses, if he feels so inclined and makes
the proper arrangements with the Board of
Health.
However, in recording these studies for pos
terity, Time winds up with the following quo
tation from Mr. Gesell in the words of Samuel
Coleridge:
"This history of a man for the nine months
preceding his birth would probably be far more
interesting and contain events of far greater
moment than all the three-score and ten years
that follow it."
We don't know what was ailing Samuel Col
eridge, and Mr. Gesell's business is his own, . . .
but we just can't see it that way. Frankly, our
own history, probably due to the often-attrib
uted dullness we are acused of, is very vague
in this "historical" period of our life. And prob
ing into the time since the age of four, we have
grown rather fond of it.
We suppose that one might assume that Ham
let, Don Quixote, and Tony Galento could all
have had astonishingly similar experiences dur
ing this time. And even if they didn't, our own
reaction is that it wouldn't have improved
Shakespeare, Cervantes, or 'Mike Jacobs very
much if all the details were known.
Whatever point there may be to this would
indicate that we oppose anyone trying to in
vade this field of activity as opposed to the
normal range of experience, and sincerely rue
the day that Mr. Coleridge's sentiments are in
public favor, or Mr. Gesell convinces some
body.
