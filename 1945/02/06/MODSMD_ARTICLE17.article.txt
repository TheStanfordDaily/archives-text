### Walrus the Carpenter 
The following is an extract from the Memoirs of John
Bell, 42nd President of the United States, published in
the year 2000 A. D.
It is perhaps too much to expect of a young man that
he will have a lively interest in matters beyond his ex
perience. Yet so pervasive is the influence of political
affairs on the common life of mankind that it is surpris
ing to find University students apathetic or ill-informed
concerning them.
In my student days social and political reforms were
topics of widespread discussion. The euJightened social
regulations of the greater Roosevelt (as he is now called
to distinguish him from an obscure relative who pre
ceded him in the Presidency) had disposed of many
of the aspects of free economic enterprise that were a
serious threat to the common welfare.
The great and sustained effort made necessary by the
war inclined people to think that it could not be, it must
not be, solely for the purpose (if destruction. A new and
better world must arise from the ashes of the old. As
i result plans for the post-war were made with the wild
flush of enthusiasm and the unconscious assumption
hat there was no substructure on which to build. "Let
us start anew" was the catchword.
The error of this state of mind became obvious as
soon as the post-wai settlements were drr.wn up. but

during the war years men seemed to breathe a purer
air of hope and encouragement for the future.
There were two groups of persons exempted from
this general optimism. The smaller group contained
those who, to their credit, saw the unsubstantial basis
of any hope that disregarded real situations. The other
and larger group was composed of those completely
indifferent to abstract ideas of any kind, and who
escaped errors not by superior judgment but solely
from apathy and inactivity.
In this latter group were to be numbered my student
friends. Il is amusing to see some of them today pose
as seers, pointing to their record of inactivity and non
participation as evidence of their freedom from popular
fallacies.
It is true that the disappointment of hopes, even
though unfounded, led to a cynicism and despair equal
ly as unjustified, and that from this the happy, vacant
minds of my student contemporaries were also pre
served.
Nevertheless the construction of society comes only
from minds occupied with such matters. Wrong they
may be, swinging from one extreme of error to an
other, yet they are stabilized by experience and correct
ed by more sober spirits. But from minds occupied by
nothing, nothing can be derived. Their partnership in
society has been lacking and they are unworthy of its
benefits, unworthy even to bear the name of that crea
ture who alone of all beings dares to raise his eyes
heavenwards.
