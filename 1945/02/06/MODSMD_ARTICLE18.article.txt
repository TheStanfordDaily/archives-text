The perennial problem of the 19th and 20th centuries,
the Eastern Question, is arising again. This is very vital
since it has caused several wars before and might pos
sibly cause several more.
Interests Involved
The Balkan states are again the pawns for two op
posite set of interests. One is the Russian, represented
l}y a Red, rather than a Romanoff, Czar. The first in
terest that Russia has is to keep friendly states on her
borders. This might actually be for the reason that
Moscow claims it is—to prevent future aggression—but
there is also the danger that it might be for spring
boards to aid future Red imperialism. Russia has hardly
been the most conciliatory member of the United Na
tions of late.
Secondly comes Great Britain. Russian expansion
to the Mediterranean would threaten her supply route
to India. That would be the first step in the province's
conquest.
Stalin has often compared himself to Peter the Great,
or at least his propaganda machine has done it for him.
Peter planned that Russia should push its expansion on
to India, but he didn't live to carry his designs through.
Comrade Stalin*seems to be good for quite a few years
yet, and Mr. Churchill thus feels some cause for worry.
Moves
The first maneuver of the present conflict was in
Greece. Mr. Churchill landed a British ai'jny, and, since
Russia and Britain are allies, Russia didn't dare inter
vene against it.
However, the government of Greece was a rightist
minority, representing a sterile, outdated and unpopu
lar monarchy. The Communist elements decided to try
to bluff both it and the British, and, while the govern
ment could be frightened, the British couldn't.
The drama was crystallizing. Mr. Churchill realized
that he couldn't hold the northern Balkan states, but
he could at least try to combine Greece and Turkey,
keeping Russia from the seacoast.
But this would only lead to new wars, and to an at
tempted balance of power between Russia and Britain
by which Germany might again profit. The American
state department undoubtedly realized the situation
and acted. A note was sent to the British government
by which we censured its action strongly. Mr. Churchill,
realizing that he could get no support from us, termi
nated the Greek Civil War and put in a government
much- more popular than either the nerveless right or
the loud-mouthed left. The people of Greece were
probably the beneficiaries, since neither of the warring
factions was a majority.
We became justly unpopular in Britain for awhile,
but then our policy became clearer. Our State Depart
ment is undoubtedly determined to have both Russia
and Britain give up power in the Balkans, to make a
strong and self-sufficient unit out of this area which
will not be a pawn but a block to aggression.
Pressure was put on Tito. He had so far held all the
cards in his country, since his opponent, General
Mikhailovich, had not tried to filter through to the coast
where the British could have helped him but just sat
in the mountains, hoping that his inactivity would re
lease enough German troops to annihilate Tito for him.
But the brave and intelligent young King Peter was
still popular, and he couldn't be shifted aside by force
of arms. Tito assembled a hand-picked parliament and
a hand-picked regency with the probable intent of
framing an election which would put him in. However,
we possessed goods—medical supplies, etc., —which
Russia does not have and which he needs. By using
Lend-Lease as a weapon, we forced him to modify his
government and put in a more legitimate regency rep
resenting the young king's interests—not Tito's.
But, if we really are to succeed, the Balkans must
be ( /onomically revived. Industry must be given to
them, and the best way it can be done is through a
Danubiari Economic Unit based on hydroelectric pow
er from thi- Danube I! we can accomplish this, it will
1-e a diplomatic vi ti for us and for peace in Europe.
That might well be .he issue of future maneuverings
in the Balkans.
