# Books to Include Fraternity Songs
## 
### 
Determined to make their organi
zation a success, members of the
recently-formed Music Council have
already embarked on a project which
they hope will prove the Council's
worth. The project consists of col
lecting songs for the publication of
an all-campus songbook which will
be ready for sale early next quarter,
v In conjunction with this plan, Bob
"Miller, council chairman, has sent
requests to all living groups to com
pile a list of their favorite songs and
to turn them in to him at Washing
ton Hall, P.A. 8771. "Although quite
a list has already been compiled, it
is by no means complete," said Miller
yesterday. "We are very anxious that
living groups who haven't already
done so turn in their song lists as
soon as possible."
The songbook will include frater
nity and sorority songs, and Miller
issued a special plea to fraternity
men on campus to turn in the songs
they know. As a special feature, the
songbook will include old Stanford
songs, "as they were sung by our
parents when they were here," said
Miller. In addition to these, miscel
laneous songs that might be suitable
are wanted to make this an all
round, all-Stanford collection.
