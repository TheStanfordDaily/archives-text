### MARIAN MORROW 
"We discovered termites," laughed
Miss Tibby, "and we figured the
Women's Clubhouse must be older
than we thought. It must be at least
25 years old."
Miss Dorothy Tibby is in her fifth
school year at Stanford as hostess of
the Women's Clubhouse, although as
she puts it, "since the war I have
just been a little of everything."
Makes Club llome-Like
She has certainly been responsible

I for the home-like atmosphere of the
clubhouse. Many graduates like it
so much they often try to rent
permanently the little guest room
i which is available only for short
i periods.
Lived in Paly
The main function of the club
house, said Miss Tibby, is to make a
j home for off-campus women. Lock
i ers are available, and the lounges
1 and pianos are used by women on
i campus as well as off.

| Miss Tibby, "our favorite cookie
maker," was born in Salt Lake City
j but lived in Palo Alto for .years,
never suspecting that she would
; someday live on the nearby campus
i she liked so much.
She came to Stanford originally in
a temporary status and now says,"I
j really seem to be one of the old
j timers. I guess it must be because
j so many of the students I knew when
I first came have graduated and are
' now coming back on visits."

; I've had many busy years, she
i continued, but last year was the
i busiest. We ran during the winter
with no help, and students did all
the cleaning up. Of course, it was
; partly because we had so many
dances, due to the many AST's and
| Wacs.
This quarter is just right, well
| balanced with meetings, dances, leas,
| and so on, she added.
Finds Farm Different
The main difference between now

, and before the war. she concluded,
is that refreshments were formerly
much more lavish, and there was
I scarcely a time when the clubhouse
kitchen wasn't in use. •
Miss Tibby wants to stay at Stan
| ford for a long time. With that
charming way, she commented, "112
never go down town and ride back
without being thrilled—l've never
gotten over il. I'm thrilled that I'm
a part of Stanford."
