# Med. I Meets Betas Tonight
## 
### DICK JENNINGS 
The powerful teams of the Roble
intramural basketball league go into
action for the second time tonight
in a schedule which sees Med. I
playing Betas, Phi Psi playing Se
quoia, the Oilers against Buchanan,
and the Cougars playing the Argu
ello Cards.
Probably the best game of the eve
ning will be the Med. I-Beta battle,
but the fratmen are favored over
the Medics because of their unstop
pable Morley Thompson. The Betas
won their first game of the official
season last Tuesday by whipping the
Sequoia Roughs 39-20, while the
Meds had a bye.
Phi -Psi and the Cougars are ex
pected to rack up easy victories
against Sequoia and the Arguello
Cards, but there are~always chances
for an upset. The Phi Psi proved
their mettle by winning all their
practice games and dumping the
Cards in the first round last Tues
day by a score of 38 to 18. They are
rated on a par with the Betas, and
should beat the Roughs by a similar
score.
The Cougars and Prescott should
run over the Cards, who rely solely
on hotshot Don Rouillard to keep
them in the running, and Buchanan's
Bearcats should defeat the Oilers
for their first official victory.
