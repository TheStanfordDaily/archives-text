# Lights Blink While Scuttlebut Rages

Last night as house and corridor
meetings were ending, lights all over
campus broke into a 5-minute blink
ing period. Though screamed ex
planations in women's living groups
ranged from suspected air raids to
calmer suppositions, such as "the
manganese in the globes just has the
hiccoughs," the power station on
campus revealed that the cause of
the blink-out was purely technical.
