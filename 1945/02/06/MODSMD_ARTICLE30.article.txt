GEN. MacARTHUR'S ADV. HQ., I
Manila Area, Tues., Feb. 6 (UP). —
American troops surrounded the
doomed Japanese garrison in Manila
today and Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur,
proclaiming the fall of the Philip
pines' capital, announced: "Our mot
to becomes 'On to Tokyo.'"
Dismounted cavalrymen and in
fantrymen closed in on the Japanese
from the north, and paratroopers of
the 11th airborne division, cut off
their escape route to the south in an
amazing overnight advance of 35 |
miles into the capital.
The enemy troops vainly tried to 1
cut connections over the Pasig River |
between the north and south sections
of the city. They blew up the Que
zon and Ayala bridges, but two more
remained.
Pockets of enemy troops, trapped
hopelessly, held out in their strong J
points and the streets were cluttered
with bodies of Japanese troops, Fili
pino guerillas, and civilians.
But it was now a mopping up job '
and Mac Arthur said of the enemy
garrison, numbering into the thou- j
sands, '"Their complete destruction is
imminent." I
Infantrymen of the 37th division
captured the Bilibid prison near the
Santo Tomas internment camp and ;
freed 800 war prisoners and about j
550 civilian internees.
