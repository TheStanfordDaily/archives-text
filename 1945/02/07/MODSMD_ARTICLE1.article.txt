GENERAL MacARTHUR'S HEADQUARTERS, Feb. 7 (UP). â€”
House-to-house fighting is raging in Manila and the trapped
Japanese garrison, engaging in wanton sabotage, have fired the
downtown business district, General Douglas Mac Arthur an
nounced today as his troops went through the city mopping up
enemy resistance pockets.
Mac Arthur's communique, covering operations up to Mon
day night, disclosed a frenzy of senseless destruction by the
Japanese soldiers and marines, estimated to number into the
thousands, who sought to destroy where they could not hope to
survive.
Front dispatches said the flames spread for a one-mile area
northward from the river to Bilibid prison, forcing Ihe Americans
to withdraw from positions they had won earlier on the north
bank of the Pasig.
