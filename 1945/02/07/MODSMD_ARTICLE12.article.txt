Curtain will go up tonight on "The Show Off" by George Kelly, a 1924

â™¦"his father-in-law and mother-in
! law with whom he lives. Herbert
Rubin will play Mr. Fisher, and
Mary Higgins, Mrs. Fisher.
Margaret Mor g a n will play
Aubrey's wife Amy. Lorna Robert
son will be seen as Clara, the sister
| in-law; Stewart Harrison as Frank
Hyland: Newton Arnold as Joe; Mar
tin Nalder as Mr. CJill: and Howard
Campbell as Mr. Rogers.
One of the most unusual features
of the comedy will be the costumes,
all in the style of the 19205, which
i the costume committee under the
I direction of Betty Wattenberger has
prepared.
The 1920's dresses were long
waisted, with the waist where the
hip line is today. They were quite
| short and had straight unbecoming
necklines. The men wore detachable
collars which were high and round.
Some of their most fancy shirts were
of striped silk.
Many of the costumes have been
; donated by local people.
After opening night tonight, there
will be four more performances of
this comedy: Thursday, Friday, Sat-
I urday, and Monday nights.
