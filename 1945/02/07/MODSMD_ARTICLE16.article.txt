# MILESTONE IN HISTORY
## 
### 
American flags wave again in Manila. First
Cavalry regulars under Major General Vern D.
Mudge won the race to the city 26 days after
our troops landed on Lingayen Gulf 107 miles
northward. Thousands of British and American
internees suffering from lack of food were lib
erated from Santo Tomas concentration camp,
scarcely able to comprehend their freedom.
Public buildings, including the Malacanan,
the president's palace, were swiftly occupied
and only scattered Japanese garrisons were able
to continue resistance in the city. Our soldiers
walk proudly down the famous Dewey Boule
vard facing Manila Bay and lined with pleasant
modern apartments, homes, wide lawns and
palm trees.
Historic Square
They pass Luneta, square where Jose Rizal,
Philippine patriot, was assassinated and face
the Japanese, making the last stand by the an
cient walled city, located in the heart of Manila.
They see Fort Santiago and the mossy churches
which date from the sixteenth century. They
stride down Pier 7, largest structure of its kind
in the world, and gaze upon the vast harbor and
the blue waters of Manila Bay.
Significance of Victory
Let us hope that this significant American
victory bodes the doom of Japanese imperial
ism and prophesies imminent realization of a
better world in which people will enjoy free
dom of thought and action, and where the worth
and dignity of each human being will be rec
ognized. This victory has refreshed our spirits
and renewed faith in our country's destiny,
which we hope lies in opposition to injustice
and inhumanity wherever it is manifest, plan
ning a fairer world for an independent Philip
pines.â€” Ted Drenton
