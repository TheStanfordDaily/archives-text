It Ain't the Same Ol' Farm . . . Potpourri
The Rest Homes are filling, fag sales are
mounting, the whole campus has been plunged
Kr.ee-deep into aspirin. Reason: worry and
mxiety over the fate of Gene (fellow Thunder
Rider) Autry who has been falling from a cliff
n the Sunday serial for more than two weeks.
As you remember, chapter one left Gene

heading straight down with little regard for
existing speed limits. As a Farm favorite Gene
was expected to fall for at least two weeks, but
to ask him to continue falling for more than
two weeks may prove a strain even for a
Thunder Rider.
Everyone Disturbed
Not only has this prolonged plunge disturbed
students, professors, and ASTudents, but it has
also thrown the Jun-i-or Thunder Riders off»
schedule. Not having Gene's example to fol
low, their current lab project, "Lessons in Ledge
Leaping," cannot be completed. The possibility
of receiving cinch notices is especially feared
by local P.E. (Phantom Empire) majors..
An instance of this campus hysteria was
seen Monday night in the Power House. Just
as he raised his little hand to the generator at
7:45 p.m. the little man suffered another attack
of the jitters.
Result
Result—a campus blink-out which continued
for five minutes before the little electrician
could pull himself together.
Yes, everything is topsy-turvy. Members of
the Third Platoon are even falling in with men
of the First Platoon.
Bow Ties
Have you seen the flashy bow ties which
the Cubberley gals have been sporting? Can
it be the return of the Stanford Rough?
