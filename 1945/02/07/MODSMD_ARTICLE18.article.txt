### JOE SHER 
BAYSHORE BACKGROUND'
In the dim, smoke-filled room, with only a few
incandescent bulbs almost obliterated by the smoky
haze, roughly dressed individuals sprawl in varied
postures and sip at their drinks, gulping as the bitter
liquid tears its fiery way down their esophagus (biology
I students take notice and explain to ccon and poly sci
majors that it's only a gullet) and conversing in low
tones about how wet it is outside and how it hampers
moving, especially if one has no wheels, while the white
clad bartender dispenses drinks and waiters move soft
ly around the room, carrying glasses and assorted
drinks.
IT'S HERE TO STAY
The muffled strains of a juke box blend into the noise
of the group as one of the big spenders in the room
staggers up to the machine and drops in a nickel. Amid
cheers and bravos he wends his way through the tables
back to his seat and resumes his conversation with a
seductive blonde, upon whom he has spent a fortune
and time (dime for a coke and a week of carrying her
books to the civ library to say nothing of three evenings
in the lobby of Roble) and resumes his smooth line
with:
"Babe, I am mad about you, will you say that you
will be mine and wear my High Y pin," or "All my
life I have waited for you and now in the prime of
life (this big mover is 17 and a frosh) I have found
you, besides I love the way you can make bubbles
with your gum."
The blonde, a worldly women (having been here a
quarter), comes back with a snappy:
"Oh yea, you just love me for my bicycle and my
new yo-yo."
All around the room scenes of this sort are going on as
brilliant minds discuss current problems and the inter
national situation (synonym for stuff).
'NITE LIFE OF THE QUADS'
The crowd at tlie bar becomes noisier and larger as
the evening goes along, people getting higher and
higher as Che time marches on. The bartender, a jangled
mass of nerves, scurries back and forth and at last in
desperation he tries one of his own drinks and drops
unconscious as the liquid freezes his very lungs.
'RECOGNIZE THESE?'
As the crowd grows more and more boisterous there
is a sudden lull as two men in suits and top coats with
hats drawn down over their eyes enter into the room
and look slowly around.
"Jiggers, gasps a frantic 17-year-old as he hastily
searches for his identification card that says he is 18.
After a close survey the two B of E men (Board of
Education men) slowly walk out and the tension sub
sides.
In this little den which is so well patronized by
thousands, millions of checks change hands and for
tunes are dropped without a murmur. Patrons arc the
famous and the infamous characters of Stanford life
and the Cellar is their haven and mecca in time of need
and shelter from the trials and tribulations of the world.
♦THE STELLAR CELLAR'
This has been a long buildup to tell that the Cellar
is piing to be open week nites, but I hope one gets the
idea and drops around during the week from 9 to
10:30 p. m.
It is fun in the evening and not as sad in the morning.
No one needs a i o glass of tomato juice, but they
have sat around an< relaxed a little, talking to the light
of their life, and saying "hello" to the mob.

brilliant minds discuss current problems and the inter

'NITE LIFE OF THE QUADS'
The crowd at tlie bar becomes noisier and larger as
the evening goes along, people getting higher and
higher as Che time marches on. The bartender, a jangled
mass of nerves, scurries back and forth and at last in
desperation he tries one of his own drinks and drops
unconscious as the liquid freezes his very lungs.
'RECOGNIZE THESE?'
As the crowd grows more and more boisterous there
is a sudden lull as two men in suits and top coats with
hats drawn down over their eyes enter into the room
and look slowly around.
"Jiggers, gasps a frantic 17-year-old as he hastily

In this little den which is so well patronized by

♦THE STELLAR CELLAR'
This has been a long buildup to tell that the Cellar
is piing to be open week nites, but I hope one gets the
idea and drops around during the week from 9 to
10:30 p. m.
It is fun in the evening and not as sad in the morning.
No one needs a i o glass of tomato juice, but they
have sat around an< relaxed a little, talking to the light
of their life, and saying "hello" to the mob.
BAYSHORE BACKGROUND'
In the dim, smoke-filled room, with only a few
incandescent bulbs almost obliterated by the smoky
haze, roughly dressed individuals sprawl in varied
postures and sip at their drinks, gulping as the bitter
liquid tears its fiery way down their esophagus (biology
I students take notice and explain to ccon and poly sci
majors that it's only a gullet) and conversing in low
tones about how wet it is outside and how it hampers
moving, especially if one has no wheels, while the white
clad bartender dispenses drinks and waiters move soft
ly around the room, carrying glasses and assorted
drinks.
IT'S HERE TO STAY
The muffled strains of a juke box blend into the noise
of the group as one of the big spenders in the room
staggers up to the machine and drops in a nickel. Amid
cheers and bravos he wends his way through the tables
back to his seat and resumes his conversation with a
seductive blonde, upon whom he has spent a fortune
and time (dime for a coke and a week of carrying her
books to the civ library to say nothing of three evenings
in the lobby of Roble) and resumes his smooth line
with:
"Babe, I am mad about you, will you say that you
will be mine and wear my High Y pin," or "All my
life I have waited for you and now in the prime of
life (this big mover is 17 and a frosh) I have found
you, besides I love the way you can make bubbles
with your gum."
The blonde, a worldly women (having been here a
quarter), comes back with a snappy:
"Oh yea, you just love me for my bicycle and my
new yo-yo."
