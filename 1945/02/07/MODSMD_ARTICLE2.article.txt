### 
LONDON, Wed., Feb. 7 (UP).â€”The Red Army yesterday
broke through Germany's Oder River defense line by establish
ing a 50-mile-wide bridgehead on its western bank 180 miles
southeast of Berlin and, the Germans said, by seizing three
smaller ones 33 to 44 miles east of the imperiled Nazi capital.
Between the lower and upper Silesian capitals of Breslau and
Oppeln, Marshal Ivan S. Knev's First Ukrainian Army crossed
the Reich "river of destiny" on a 22-mile front and advanced 12
miles in a drive that ultimately may outflank Berlin from the
south.
Nazi broadcasts said the Russians had secured another bridge
head northwest of Breslau where they captured the transport
center of Steinau 133 miles southeast of Berlin.
