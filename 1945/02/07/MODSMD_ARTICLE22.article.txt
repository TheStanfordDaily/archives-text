# Torrid Betas Lick Meds 33-6, Oilers Stopped By Bearcats
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
The sensational Betas all but
walked over a hapless Med. 1 team
by a score of 33-1(5. With the Betas
dominating both backboards, it was
all their opponents could do to get
the ball. Morley Thompson, stellar
guard for the "fratmen," duplicated
his feat of last Tuesday night by
swishing 14 points through the hoop.
A recent addition to the team,
George Bower, chalked up a of
11 digits and countered with almost
every shot he took. Forced to resort
to long shooting all evening, Sugar
of the Meds tallied 10 points.
Betas Improve
After a few defeats in pre-season
practice games, the "Reds" look as

i though they will go on to top the
Roble League with only slight op-
I position from the Cougars and Royal
Flush, both Army teams.
Bearcats Win
In what proved to be a slow game,
the Buchanan Bearcats eked out a
close victory over the Oilers, the |
score being 18-16. Although the
. Oilers were leading at the half, 10-8.
the "Cats" came back to cop the j
1 decision through the sharpshooting j
' of Christy and McClung, who scored j
; 8 points and 6 points respectively.
' Marsh seemed to be the only man !
who could hit the hoop for the losers,
plunking through four buckets for
a total of 8 digits.
Both of these teams are compara- j
; tively weak, the Oilers having lost
i a previous game to the Cougars I
; 3i-3.
