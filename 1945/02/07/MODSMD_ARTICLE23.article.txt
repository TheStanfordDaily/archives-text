Why do the high scoring basket
ball players gain the most recogni
tion in the papers and on all-star
teams? More than just a few recent
examples have brought this matter
to our attention, and we can't help
wondering why the good defensive
player and the main offensive cogs
don't gain proper recognition for
their hard, but low scoring, work.
Any enthusiastic sports fan knows
that over half of the members of
all-star football teams are selected
on their showings as good defensive
players. Half of the All-Americans
never scored a single point under
game conditions.
Baseball, too, runs on this same
assumption. The fact that a player
such as Vernon Stephens of the St.
Louis Browns is a poor hitter does
not keep him from winning con
tinual glory as one of the game's
top shortstops. The greatest pitchers
of all time, barring freaks, have
been the poorest hitters and run
producers in the game.
Why, then, are the tributes for
basketball wins dumped on the high
est scoring player? It is true that in
basketball, the team that puts the
most points on the scoreboard will
win. Because of that, the game has
been diverted from a defensive game
into a offensive one. some scores
heading way up into the 7(t's.
This past week-end contributed
splendid examples for this argument.

Newspapers gave most of the credit
! for Cal_'s 53-37 win over USC to
| high-scoring Gus Mota, who tallied
i 20 points. No mention was made of
I the fellows who took the ball off
I the backboard, brought it down the
I court, and fed it to Mota.
The Coast Guard Sealions also got
! a well-warranted victory over St.
Marys Preflight, but in the head
lines were the tales of "Sensational
Kevin O'Shea" of the Lions. True,
that the sparkling O'Shea made 2'.i
points, but what about the fellows
| who kept the Preflight score low
and bottled up the St. Marys of-
I lense?
We would venture to say that
nearly every player pickcd on an
All - American basketball team is the
highest scorer of his own squad.
! "Hank" Luisetti would never have

become Stanford's greatest of al?
time if lie had been a low-scoring
guard.
Why not give more credit to the
fellows who rightly deserve it? A
team is no stronger tjian its weak
est man. Therefore, a good team
must have five good men, all work
ing and fighting equally hard. The
other four men must be good, too.

never scored a single point under
game conditions.
Baseball, too, runs on this same
assumption. The fact that a player
such as Vernon Stephens of the St.
Louis Browns is a poor hitter does
not keep him from winning con
tinual glory as one of the game's
top shortstops. The greatest pitchers
of all time, barring freaks, have
been the poorest hitters and run
producers in the game.
Why, then, are the tributes for
basketball wins dumped on the high
est scoring player? It is true that in
basketball, the team that puts the
most points on the scoreboard will
win. Because of that, the game has
been diverted from a defensive game
into a offensive one. some scores
heading way up into the 7(t's.
This past week-end contributed
splendid examples for this argument.

Newspapers gave most of the credit
! for Cal_'s 53-37 win over USC to
| high-scoring Gus Mota, who tallied
i 20 points. No mention was made of
I the fellows who took the ball off
I the backboard, brought it down the
I court, and fed it to Mota.
The Coast Guard Sealions also got
! a well-warranted victory over St.
Marys Preflight, but in the head
lines were the tales of "Sensational
Kevin O'Shea" of the Lions. True,
that the sparkling O'Shea made 2'.i
points, but what about the fellows
| who kept the Preflight score low
and bottled up the St. Marys of-
I lense?
We would venture to say that
nearly every player pickcd on an
All - American basketball team is the
highest scorer of his own squad.
! "Hank" Luisetti would never have

become Stanford's greatest of al?
time if lie had been a low-scoring
guard.
Why not give more credit to the
fellows who rightly deserve it? A
team is no stronger tjian its weak
est man. Therefore, a good team
must have five good men, all work
ing and fighting equally hard. The
other four men must be good, too.
Why do the high scoring basket
ball players gain the most recogni
tion in the papers and on all-star
teams? More than just a few recent
examples have brought this matter
to our attention, and we can't help
wondering why the good defensive
player and the main offensive cogs
don't gain proper recognition for
their hard, but low scoring, work.
Any enthusiastic sports fan knows
that over half of the members of
all-star football teams are selected
on their showings as good defensive
players. Half of the All-Americans
never scored a single point under
game conditions.
