# 'Hollywood Canteen' Is Majestic Bore
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN — Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
If anything good at all could be
about "Hollywood Canteen," it
could only be that it is not in Techni
color. In the words of W. Gibbs. New
Yorker Reviewer, "it is certainly one
of the most majestic bores ever im
posed on the American people." Al
beit, one thing the people of Holly
wood must be commended for is the
time they have spent in fox-holes,
in the mud of Italy, in the camps
and the canteens. In the present
'epic" Hollywood commends itself,
and makes a little cash to boot.
The picture has itself to do with a

corporal named Slim (Robert Hut
| ton), who has been wounded in the

Pacific and sud
denly finds him- :
self losing his
head ov e r thej
beauties of Hol
-Iywo o d, and,
meeting famous
screen personali
ties. Joan Leslie j
coid p 1 etes the |
romantic situa- j
tion. The corpo- j
ral, as fate would

I have it. is the one-millionth man to
| enter the Canteen, and by this virtue
! is rewarded with a week-end date
with his favorite star —Miss Leslie.
He carries on a bit of a luke-warm

, love affair, but it soon breaks up.
This dilute plot affords opportunity
for presenting a monstrous east of
: old favorites: Bette Davis, John Gar
field, Jack Benny, Joe E. Brown,
j and, as you probably know, many,
i many, others.
j The appearance of John Garfield
j without a neurosis (nor even a ma
! chine gun) was as much a surprise
| as seeing Helmut Dantine without
j his Nazi arm band, an unfortunate
J situation which was an obvious over
sight. Best of all was the appearance
of a personality of considerable
talent. Roy Rogers' horse, Trigger, a
j delightful bit of horse pulchritude,
| white, and resplendent in silver.
