### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
Shouldering her way through the
flea-bitten crowd, your reporter
burst into the sumptuous Chaparral
Office to get the glad tidings from
new Old Boy, Dick Driseoll. that
the Winter edition of the Chaparral,
one of the nation's leading maga
zines, will be out sometime in the
next two weeks.

"This issue will be the verra
thing," he said, "Everyone on cam
pus should buy at least 200 copies

to send to friends
and relatives. In
i'act, the Chap
pies will consider
anybody who
buys less than
that number a
complete chintz."
Leaving the
Old Boy to fight
off a mob of Se
quoia Roughs
who had invaded

the Press Building, your reporter
made her way out to the back shop
where she found business manager,
Bill Gilbert, Men's Council tyrant,
and Barney Gugel. managing editor,
tearing at each other's throats.
"I'm going to put an ad on page 31,
whether you like it, or not," shouted
Gilbert.
"Over my dead body," was the
answer.
Eyeing Gilbert's 300-pound jewel
studded mace (presented to him as a
token of esteem by campus traffic
violators) Gugel withdrew the state
ment. and as A result, an advertise
ment will appear on page 31. As a
matter of fact, there may be seven
or eight ads appearing on page 31.
As your reporter hurriedly left the
Press, she heard Gugel and Gilbert
chanting the famous Palistrina ma
drigal, "Listen to the good news, pal.
Just 12 more days til Chaparral!",
with Driseoll and Breer in on the
baritone obligato.


Dick Driseoll
