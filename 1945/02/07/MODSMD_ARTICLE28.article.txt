# Second 'Labor' Debate Today
## 
### 
Debaters Mary Westeott and Gor
don Levy will meet a visiting Cal
team in the second Home-Home de
bate on the labor arbitration ques
tion, to be held today at 4 p. m. in
the Women's Clubhouse.
"As the question of the govern
ment's right to compulsory arbitra
tion of labor disputes has been
brought to the nation's attention,
we are expecting considerable local
interest in the debate," said Carol
Newton, debate manager.
Miss Westeott and Mr. Levy will
speak in defense of the proposition,
"Resolved, that the federal govern
ment should enact legislation for the
compulsory arbitration of labor dis
putes where voluntary means have
failed."
A Stanford team consisting of
Dorothy Willner and Marshall Small
upheld the opposite stand in the first
of the Home-Home debates, held
yesterday at Berkeley.
Tomorrow's debate will not be
judged, but will be followed by a
discussion of the case in which the
audience will be invited to partici
pate, according to Miss Newton.
Tryouts for participation in the
Valentine's Day debate began last
Monday night with speakers debat
ing by candlelight the pros and cons
of the peacetime conscription ques
tion, according to Miss Newton, who
added that tryouts will continue next
week.
