i In a highly unique program Mrs.
I Laura Bolton, noted explorer and
j world traveler, last night exhibited
' to the Tuesday Evening Series audi
j ence two films on the people of
Canada, accompanied by an explana
tory talk and by recordings of the
music of the different types of na
tionalities settled in Canada.
"The American people know less
about Canada than they do about the
countries of South America," said
Mrs. Bolton in a short introductory
talk. Canada is a land of physical
contrasts, she added, "ranging from
J tundra, to rugged mountains, to roll
| ing prairie land."

''It is a land of contrasting people
as well," she continued, and her film
illustrated briefly the lives of the
aboriginal Eskimos, the Indians of
Northern Canada, the French set
tlers of Quebec and the Gaspe penin
sula, the Scots of Nova Scotia, and
the Ukranians of South Central
Canada.
In the first picture, entitled "Cana
da," Mrs. Bolton took the audience
with her on a walrus hunt along the
icy shores of the South Arctic Sea.
The walrus is the chief sustenance
of the hardy Eskimos, and they put
it to every conceivable use. The
movie depicted some of the Eskimo
customs, and brought with it the
strange, mournfu tones of their
primitive music.
The audience next traveled to the
other side of Canada where the
French preserve a culture brought
across the Atlantic more than 300
years ago. Their music, and that of
the Scots of Nova Scotia, retains the
remarkably primitive flavor of the
old French and Gaelic music.
