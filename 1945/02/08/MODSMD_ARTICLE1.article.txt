## 
### 
PARIS, Thurs., Feb. 8 (UP).- -The American First and Third
armies broke through the Siegfried Line in four places yester
day as Lieut. Gen. George S. Patton's troops exploded a new
attack that drove a mile deep into Germany along a 24-mile
stretch of the German Luxembourg river border.
Four new divisions of the Third Army—the fifth and eightieth,
seventeenth airborne and sixth armored—breached the Germans'
Our and Sure river defenses at ten points north of Ecchternach,
extending the blazing American drive to a 75-mile front that
reached within 27 miles of the Rhine.
Patton's troops that have fighting into and through the Eifel
mountains for the past ten days broke completely through the
West Wall at three new points west and northwest of Preum,
capturing four towns in bitter, half-mile advances through the
last of the pillbox belt.
These new gains put the Third Army completely across the
forested, snow-choked ridges of the Eifel range and set the stage
for the three-mile downhill drive along good roads to Preum,
main key to the enemy's defenses along Patton's entire 40-mile
front.
