# Excommittee May Revise Election Rules
## 
### 
In a report on elections and nomi
nations prepared by Joanne Soule
and J. D. Williams and presented

to Excom last
night, a recom
mendation was
made that the
sole function of
Nominating Com
mittee be to fill
out the ballot for
any office for

! which an insufficient number or me- I
! diocre candidates had petitioned to ;
I run.
That present membership of Nom
! mating Committee be revised to in
' elude one member from each class.
| one member from Conference and
' Inter-hall Council, and one A.S.S.U.
! official; that the committee no longer
i be a function of Conference; that
| petitioning be the sole mode of be
| coming a candidate for an office,
j were further recommendations of
i the report.
Bill Gilbert challenged the de- I
mocracy of a system wherein a com- j
mittee could, as does the present j
| committee, prevent any person from I
; running for an office as the result j
;of an interview before it. Further !
' question was made of the advisa- :
[ bility of having a committee which |
i could determine arbitrarily, from
prepared lists, what persons should
i fill out the ballot, as the Soulc-Wil- i
| liams report recommends.
Education of potential candidates j
| could be undertaken by a revised j
j Leadership Institute program, ac- i
j cording to Marylou McClurc, so that j
function of the present Nominating \
j Committee could be dispensed with, j
Discussion of these and further j
points was tabled until next week, ,
so that Excom members may read j
and question more fully its implica- j
i tions and problems.
Report was made by newly ap- !
j pointed men's co-ordinator, Gene
i Burton, on the progress of the war
| work program which he has begun
j in the men's halls. A stamp drive,
j lasting from Feb. 12 to 23, will at
j tempt to raise a $2.50 quota from I
I each man; a salvage drive under the !
chairmanship of Bob Abrams is be- j
j ing organized; stevedoring gangs arc
! being sent, to work in Redwood City; j
| and a survey of the work already
j being done is getting under way I
under Bob Aiken's supervision.
