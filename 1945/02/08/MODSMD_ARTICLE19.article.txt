Loss than two weeks remain be

all-campus Pow-Wow, according to
general chairman Peggy Fitts. Sug

by Ram's Head, the show is open to
all groups, formal or informal, on
the campusâ€”faculty, students; de
partment majors and hasher crews;
clubs, basketball teams, and bridge
foursomes.
All groups wishing to enter will
be in the running for three prizes,
supplied by Ram's Head, for the best
done, most original, and funniest
acts. To be judged by representa

Head, the skits arc unrestricted as
to subject matter.
Originally Required
Only qualification will Le origi
nality, time limit of from one to
eight minutes, props and costumes
restricted to what, can be carried on
and off-stage with the players.
Groups who are already muttering
behind their hands about the March
2 event, to be held in the Memorial
Auditorium, have planned skits de
picting campus traditions and pit
falls; take-offs of famous acts of
stage, screen and radio; original
songs, dances and melodramas. Sug
gestion at one lunch table: a take
off on a Dick Tracy strip, with such
famous personages as Gravel Gertie
and Prune-face.
May Be Tradition
Designed solely for participation
and entertainment of Stanfordites,
the Pow-Wow, if successful, may
become a traditional show under the
sponsorship of Ram's Head, similar
in its competitive nature to the all
campus Spring Sing, under Cardi
nals' leadership.
Student groups who wish to re
hearse in the Memorial Auditorium
may arrange times with Mary Lou
Patton at the Jessie Jordan House.
Blossom Parke, Cardinal in charge
of publicity, reminds us: "Watch for
the Pow-Wow tepee!"
