# All-Campus Dance At Nitery Friday
## 
### 
Following up his program as
Nitery manager, Johnny Jenkins an
| nounced an all-campus no-date
I dance Friday evening from 8 to 11:30
I p.m., to fill in a blank space on the
J Farm's social calendar.
Committee appointed to aid him
! throughout the quarter is as follows:
j Ellon EI lory, in charge of patrons
i and patronesses; Ray Sanders, tcch
j nical arrangements; and Jim Enicr
j son, adviser.
Jenkins added that cards, news
j papers and games arc being pur-
I chased for the Nitery on an experi
| mental basis. "If the students approve
| of having cards and magazines in
the Nitery, they will leave them
| there; otherwise we will assume that
' the students would just as soon have
| us remove the games and cards, and
; cancel all our subscriptions."
The Nitery dance is informal.
