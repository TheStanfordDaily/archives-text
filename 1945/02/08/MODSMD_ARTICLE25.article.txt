# A 						Lease on a New Stanford
## HOUSING COMMITTEE 
### 
A h; If -dozen years of possible bitterness and
or a new unity among Stan
ford women can be accomplished by the work
of the new Housing Committee which will de
cide this year how Stanford women will live
after next fall.
The most pressing problems are the actual
transition of the sororities into University resi
donces, the selection of people to fill vacancies
in the old sorority houses, and the breaking up
of ihe huge class of freshman women now in
Branner, Ventura, and Roble.
Actually the most difficult problem of the
committee will be to overcome the bewilder
ment, prejudices, and actual bitterness that a
year of indecision and misinformation has cre
ated.
The Daily is going to insist upon the most
complete coverage that it can give. We are
fully convinced th t most of the alarm over
the present problem, and its only excuse for
being a "hot potato," is the lack of responsible
fact, and lack of faith among the women of
Stanford in themselves.
With a full presentation of the possible solu
tions, the authority of the committee, and the
opposition, Stanford students ought to be able
io make an intelligent and acceptable decision
lor the majority of women.
The President's office is currently investigat
ing the financial phases of the situation and with
Dean Yost will set down the essential admin
istrative bounds within which the committee
can work.
There is a wide scope to the committee's au
thority; and within the extremes of direct se
lection of people to fill the houses, by either
the living groups or the authorities, this com
mittee should be able to work out a reason
able plan.
Whatever the plan, we must insist on open
meetings and frankness on the part of all in
volved. The Daily will be pleased to receive
opinions from anyone about the actions to be
taken, especially while the decisions are being
made.
The committee—for the sake of full repre
sentation is overlarge to achieve effective ac
tion, but the people on it seem well qualified
and exceptionally fair.
We have every hope that with care and con
sistent effort to air the facts for everyone's con
sideration, this group can give the campus some
of the encouragement and unity which it re
quires for the transition years during and im
mediately after the war.

year of indecision and misinformation has cre
ated.
The Daily is going to insist upon the most
complete coverage that it can give. We are
fully convinced th t most of the alarm over
the present problem, and its only excuse for
being a "hot potato," is the lack of responsible
fact, and lack of faith among the women of
Stanford in themselves.
With a full presentation of the possible solu
tions, the authority of the committee, and the
opposition, Stanford students ought to be able
io make an intelligent and acceptable decision
lor the majority of women.
The President's office is currently investigat
ing the financial phases of the situation and with
Dean Yost will set down the essential admin
istrative bounds within which the committee
can work.
There is a wide scope to the committee's au
thority; and within the extremes of direct se
lection of people to fill the houses, by either
the living groups or the authorities, this com
mittee should be able to work out a reason
able plan.
Whatever the plan, we must insist on open
meetings and frankness on the part of all in
volved. The Daily will be pleased to receive
opinions from anyone about the actions to be
taken, especially while the decisions are being
made.
The committee—for the sake of full repre
sentation is overlarge to achieve effective ac
tion, but the people on it seem well qualified
and exceptionally fair.
We have every hope that with care and con
sistent effort to air the facts for everyone's con
sideration, this group can give the campus some
of the encouragement and unity which it re
quires for the transition years during and im
mediately after the war.
