## EDUCATION FOR GERMANY 
### 
Tlie Editor, Sir:
If Mr. John Parks of the University of California and
J were engaged in a debate on the subject, "How can
we educate Germany after the war," with his rebuttal
of January 29 we would have arrived at a vacuum.
In my letter of January 4, I argued the point that we
(ould not and therefore should not attempt to educate
(lermany after the war. Mr. Parks replies that the
Germans must be educated, period. Agreed. Of course
the Germans must be educated to new ways of life and
I eace. And so must we all. And we might begin by
not being too scornful of the "uncritical, sheeplike
mentality of the German people" to which Mr. Parks
refers. Thf<re is mote, brother, in our own eye.
Each to Each
The German scholars will educate Germans; the
French scholars will educate Frenchmen; the Indian
scholars will educate Indians; the American scholars
will educate Americans—all in the ways of peace—that
i: providing the militarists keep their noses out of the
matter and leave education to the educators. And in
this connection it i- reassuring to note the steadfast
opposition of the k. dors of education, including our
own president of Stanford, to peace-time militarism.
Will Youth Rebel?
In closing it might he well to note that we are dealing
here, more or less, in abstractions; for while educators
speak of reeducating Germany along the lines here
discussed, the existing governments have no such
i ' lion. They actually are preparing to send foreign
Uicators" into Germany to "educate" the German
; Miilh. It : against this proposal that I protested and
t ->nlinue to protest.
A. the Christian Century has well said concerning

I their proposal, "The more the schoolmaster teaches
according to the demands of Germany's conquerors, the
! more the heart of German youth will rebel . . . Imposed
education of the kind which some would attempt in
post-war Germany never works. Circumventing its
efforts becomes a patriotic expression for the elders
and a glorious adventure for the young."
