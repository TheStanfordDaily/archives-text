# HAVE FAITH, DEAR FANS

### 
The Editor. Dear Sir:
It seems that Gene Autry has caused a dilemma in
the minds of the "Phantom Empire" fans. The trouble
was caused when Chapter Three arrived from the film
company instead of Chapter Two! But think it through
carefully, fans and have faith in Geneâ€”you knew he'd
pull himself together at the bottom of that cliff, any
way, didn't you? Just to prove it for you doubtful ones,
he's gone over another cliff.
