# Seen from an Ivory Tower
## 
### Walrus the Carpenter 
I am a patient man, and not easily roused to passion.
For the most part, since I am quite ignorant of the
goings-on in the great world outside this Ivory Tower,
I have remained tolerant and affable before, during,
and even after reading The Daily's Editorials.
Today the worm turns, the caterpillar capitulates no
longer—for the secred realm of Science has been in
vaded, the sanctified altars upturned, the altar cloth
besmirched by the disrespectful, incomprehending
presence of a layman. I speak—and my soul is chilled
with horror—of the Editorial of Tuesday morning.
Long have I tolerated the submission of my column to
the irresponsible scissors and pencils of Sub-Editors
and Over-Enthusiastic Copyreaders who, under the
guise of paring the column down to a printable size,
have also succeeded in mangling my carefully polished
literary efforts. Long have I suffered under the crass
insensibilities of these hewers and choppers of words,
these unhappy animals who have been forced to under
go some sort of intensive desensitizing process whereby
all sense of style or literary good judgement has been
utterly destroyed. I can stand it no more.
Every night, before I clamber into my cozy bed, I
have said a brief but heart-felt prayer for the salvation
of their souls from the evil desire to be journalists.
Alas, as I gaze over the tragic Tuesday editorial, I see
that my prayers have been in vain. The Forces of
Darkness have been too great for me in this bitter
struggle.
Last week my dear friend the Editor wrote two edi
torials belaboring Science and Scientists for attempting
to discuss man and his nature, without adequate knowl
edge of his nature. Today the Editor launches into a
patronizing attack upon Dr. Arnold Gesell, who dares
to be interested in and imaginative about the nature of
man.
Perhaps to the Editor a baby is no problem: but if
she had attended a lecture Dr. Gesell gave here about
two years ago, or had peeked into a text on child
psychology, she would have seen that there is far far
more to a baby than even the fondest of mothers could
imagine. A baby is more than a struggling, squalling
mass of bumptious protoplasm; it doesn't "just grow,"
like a rubber balloon. It follows a distinct pattern ol
development, both physical and psychological; and
these patterns of development are important in de
termining the sort of person it will be when it grows up.
Dr. Gesell's work indicates that there is a complicated
pattern in pre-natal development, perhaps even more
important in determining later life.
Cruelly, we suggest that some sinister event early
in the development of the embryo, some minor error
of nature predetermines before birth the fate of those
journalists who err in practicing the facetious criticism
of science.
