The European theater of war may, at present, be
divided into five m.iin sectors. These are the Western
front, the northern and southern ends of the Russian
front, the Balkan front, and the Italian sector. Four are
in action, and the battles now going on might possibly
fit tightly into a picture of German defensive strategy.
The crucial front for the enemy is the northern Polish
sector. The Red Army is very strongly concentrated
here, and a breakthrough would mean the loss of Berlin
and the carrying of the war to the industrial centers
behind the Elbe. He can stand a Russian conquest ol
Silesia since it would have to overcome many natural
barriers in order to keep on going. He can draw out of
Italy behind the Alps, out of the Rhineland to behind
that river, and out of the Balkans to a line between the
Bohmerwald mountains and the Alps.
Shift to the North
Thus, as the Russians reached the Oder, both they
and the enemy started shifting north to the Berlin
theater. But the Germans had the advantage in this
game, because they had fallen back to their homeland
where communications are good, and had wrecked the
railways and bridges in Poland as they retreated.
Thus he is now building up his strength in the north,
and the Russians, unable to reshuffle their heavier
masses of men with such facility, are now doing the
only possible thing—advancing in the south.
The enemy might also be drawing out of Italy in
oyder to shift troops to Russia. Since all of Jugoslavia
is practically gone anyway, uncovering the Istrian
peninsula would be no tragedy. At any rate, the Ger
man line ai'ound Bologna is beginning to cave in.
Italy Line Moves
The conduct of operations in Italy has reduced in
significance since the great battles in Poland and
France started, but still it presents some interesting
tactical operations, and thus is certainly worth men
tioning.
After his retreat from Rome, Kesselring drew himself
up in the Gothic line. This was a good position except
that the Apennines, in the center of his front, curved
| around to the Mediterranean and boxed up his light
1 flank.
General Alexander, then in charge, made excellent
use of this flaw by feinting at Kesselring's right and
suddenly lunging into his left.
Kesselring reacted well. He shifted all oi his units
out of the box, and stopped the British armies advanc
ing along the Adriatic. General Clark's Fifth Army
succeeded in occupying the box, but then Kesselring
stabilized a line south of Bologna, completely reversing
the situation. Now our left instead ol his right was
penned up.
New Attack Launched
Then we launched a new attack on his left. He un
doubtedly calculated that we had weakened our own
I to do it, and thus counterattacked over on the Medi
terranean end of his line. He was stopped, but opera
tions ceased on both sides.
Now they have started again, and the enemy might
be terminating this classic little campaign by falling
; back behind the Alps.
' As for the Western front, the enemy seems to have
! denuded it long ago. We are breaking into the Siegfried
Line, and the enemy might have to fall back behind
j the Rhine in order to release enough troops to stop the
' Russians.

theater. But the Germans had the advantage in this
game, because they had fallen back to their homeland
where communications are good, and had wrecked the
railways and bridges in Poland as they retreated.
Thus he is now building up his strength in the north,
and the Russians, unable to reshuffle their heavier
masses of men with such facility, are now doing the
only possible thing—advancing in the south.
The enemy might also be drawing out of Italy in
oyder to shift troops to Russia. Since all of Jugoslavia
is practically gone anyway, uncovering the Istrian
peninsula would be no tragedy. At any rate, the Ger
man line ai'ound Bologna is beginning to cave in.
Italy Line Moves
The conduct of operations in Italy has reduced in
significance since the great battles in Poland and
France started, but still it presents some interesting
tactical operations, and thus is certainly worth men
tioning.
After his retreat from Rome, Kesselring drew himself
up in the Gothic line. This was a good position except
that the Apennines, in the center of his front, curved
| around to the Mediterranean and boxed up his light
1 flank.
General Alexander, then in charge, made excellent
use of this flaw by feinting at Kesselring's right and
suddenly lunging into his left.
Kesselring reacted well. He shifted all oi his units
out of the box, and stopped the British armies advanc
ing along the Adriatic. General Clark's Fifth Army
succeeded in occupying the box, but then Kesselring
stabilized a line south of Bologna, completely reversing
the situation. Now our left instead ol his right was
penned up.
New Attack Launched
Then we launched a new attack on his left. He un
doubtedly calculated that we had weakened our own
I to do it, and thus counterattacked over on the Medi
terranean end of his line. He was stopped, but opera
tions ceased on both sides.
Now they have started again, and the enemy might
be terminating this classic little campaign by falling
; back behind the Alps.
' As for the Western front, the enemy seems to have
! denuded it long ago. We are breaking into the Siegfried
Line, and the enemy might have to fall back behind
j the Rhine in order to release enough troops to stop the
' Russians.
The European theater of war may, at present, be
divided into five m.iin sectors. These are the Western
front, the northern and southern ends of the Russian
front, the Balkan front, and the Italian sector. Four are
in action, and the battles now going on might possibly
fit tightly into a picture of German defensive strategy.
The crucial front for the enemy is the northern Polish
sector. The Red Army is very strongly concentrated
here, and a breakthrough would mean the loss of Berlin
and the carrying of the war to the industrial centers
behind the Elbe. He can stand a Russian conquest ol
Silesia since it would have to overcome many natural
barriers in order to keep on going. He can draw out of
Italy behind the Alps, out of the Rhineland to behind
that river, and out of the Balkans to a line between the
Bohmerwald mountains and the Alps.
Shift to the North
Thus, as the Russians reached the Oder, both they
and the enemy started shifting north to the Berlin
theater. But the Germans had the advantage in this
game, because they had fallen back to their homeland
where communications are good, and had wrecked the
railways and bridges in Poland as they retreated.
