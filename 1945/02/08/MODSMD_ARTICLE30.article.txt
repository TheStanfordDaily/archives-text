# French Government Analyzed By Dr. Guerard, Noted Author
## 
### 
(Editorial note: This article on
the postwar world will deal with
the problem of France.)
The French provisional govern
ment is "the most legitimate on the
face of the earth today," feels Dr.
Albert Guerard, noted author and
authority on France.
"Technically, it is one of the most
illegal," he continued, "without even
a written constitution; but it has no
toriously more popular backing than
our own government."
Its leader, de Gaulle, was sup
ported not only by his own Free
French in England and the French
colonies, but by the other source of
resistance within France itself.
Frenchmen support him as a states
man who knows what he wants and
offers a hopeful program for get
ting it.
Shrewd Leader
He is a patriot who wants France
to be great. He will work for French
recognition and equality, but he is
shrewd enough not to work blindly.
He realizes that France cannot go
back to her old isolated nationalism,
but must support a world peace or
ganization. Because of her central
geographic position she cannot help
but be the nucleus of European
unity. Any disturbance in Europe
is reflected in France.
This does not mean that France
will approve the postwar organiza
tion offered by the Dumbarton Oaks
plan, for this distributes main power
among the Big Four, England, China,
Russia, and the United States; with
France included later as the Fifth
Big Power.
But the Dumbarton Plan is only a
preliminary draft, and the French
government will have ample chance

to bid for more recognition in the
finished plan.
Chance for Leadership
They can do this in one of two
ways. (1) They can make the most
of their position as Fifth Bit; Power.
(2) They can lead the smaller coun
tries in asking for complete equality
for all. rather than privilege for the
stronger nations (and this is their
best chance for leadership, believes
Dr. Guerard). As the mouthpiece of
some 45 nations they would have
tremendous prestige, and de Gaulle
is shrewd enough to use it.
I m persona I Viewpoint
Dr. Guerard emphasizes that he
is not speaking from a French point
of view, but merely as an observer.
He speaks first as a citizen of the
world, second as an American, third
as a European, and only fourth as a
man with great sympathy for
France.
When asked about French terri
torial plans, he quoted George Bi
dou, minister of foreign affairs.
''France has no desire for foreign
territory." But Dr. Guerard agrees
with de Gaulle that for security's
sake, France must control the left
bank of the Rhine. This would not,
include French settlement, but mere
military control.
Watch on the Rhine
As long as we show any distrust
of Germany, someone must keep a
"watch on the Rhine," and only
France has the vital interest to make
it effective. Neither England nor
the United Slates wants the job
and they will probably not deny it
to France.
Such a system would be far from
ideal, admits Dr. Guerard, and it
would certainly not be good for cen
turies. But there can be no half

way measures in distrust of Ger
many. Only when real peace dis
places mere stopping of hostilities
could this armed watch be removed.
What Then?
France's provisional government
will probably carry her through the
first months of peace as well as the
last of war. Alter her most urgent
foreign problems are solved, she can
turn to the home front. When the
refugees and prisoners return, her
people can elect a permanent gov
ernment, probably containing many
of the same men as the present one.
Then they will work to rebuild
France into a social democracy.
