# Eagles Battle Tyler Tonight In Basketball
## 
### 
Continuing with the second week
of official intra-mural play, the La
gunita League is going all-out to
night, as the Legal Eagles take on
Tyler, Gerona battles Med. 11, the
Cubs and the Arguello Whites have
it out, and the Grizzlies vie with the
Strangers.
The top game of the evening should
be the Legal Eagles-Tyler encounter.
Both of these teams are strong, and
the game is a toss-up. Anything can,
and probably will, happen. The
Gerona-Med. II will be another game
of the same type, in which there is
very small margin to choose from.
The Cubs and the Arguello Whites
should be a hot contest, with the
Cubs rated a little above their op
ponents. However, the Whites have
risen to the occasion before and
might be just the team to start the
upsets. Both the Grizzlies and the
Strangers are still unknown; neither
of them has yet been on the ball,
but both are potentially strong.

Tyler-Legal Eagles 7:15
Gerona-Med. II 8:15
