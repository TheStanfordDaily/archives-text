# Morgan, High Excellent In 'Show Off' Opening
## 
### 
Maggie Morgan as Amy and John
ny High as Aubrey Piper, better
known as the "Show-off," gave the
outstanding performances in a well
timed, carefully directed first-night
performance of George Kelly's "The
Show-oil"' last night in the Little
Theater.
The general comments of "Well
done," "That was good" of the first
night audience, as it chuckled out
of the theater, were an excellent re
flection of the thought-provoking
play that alternated strangely be
tween straight comedy and tragi
comedy.
Although the apparent intention
of author and cast is to present a
comedy, certain hints in the first act,
and a seenc in the second act be
tween Aubrey, the "Show-off," and
his wife Amy (which is easily the
best in the play) carry a painful,
foreboding note reminiscent of the

Porter scene in Macbeth.
However, woosh. in the last act.
all implications of tragedy arc
turned off and we settle down to
be funny in earnest with only a hint
which High's effective but highly
stylized acting failed to bring out,
that, the solution of the whole lay
in the underlying good faith and
affection—reciprocated by the fam
ily though they'd scarcely own it—
of that nauseating bore, "The Show
off."
Space does not permit an ade
quate appreciation of Mary Higgins
as Mrs. Fisher. She had the figure,
the business, the walk, and particu
larly the lines to make her charac
ter, as character, carry more clearly
perhaps than anyone's on the stage.
However, a tendency to rush her
lines and occasionally to shout them
marred the general effect.
Credit for general excellence also
clearly goes to Lorna Robertson as
"Clara" in a difficult role, to the cos
tume crew for digging up those hi
larious 1928 costumes, but above all
to Maggie Morgan whose presence
was noticeable in every scene for
its calming, intensifying effect on
her fellow actors as well as on the
quality of the play itself. — Nancy
