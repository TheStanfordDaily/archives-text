### MORT COHEN 
It looks like we're not the only
ones who are looking around for
something to do in the field of sports,
for we have just read where a couple
of the boys, an Oregon coach on
leave and an ex-bridge expert turned
sports fan, have decided to add a
little to the game of basketball. At
least, they are sincere in their be
liefs.
All that they want to do. and they
have already talked Columbia and
Fordham into trying it out tonight,
is to change the system of scoring a
little. They feel that a person who
scores from more than 21 feet out
deserves an extra bonus, and that he
should receive three points instead
of the usual two. They have nothing
else against basketball and feel that
the game might survive if only one
other change were made; they want
to give the player taking the foul
shot the option of taking a chance
from 21 feet out and scoring two
points, or taking a shot from 12 feet
out (the foul line is now only six
feet from the basket) and registering
one point. And that is what they call
adding a little to the game.
We are sincerely surprised, al
though one could expert anything
from a bridge fiend. First of all, that
new scoring system would complete
ly change the concept of an offense.
In the last years, the offense has been
built around getting the hail in close
and taking a shot from there; it is
the genera! belief that a player's
chance of connecting varies indirect
ly with the distance from the basket.
Now if they change the scoring so
that two shots from 21 feet out are
worth three shots from anywhere
inside thai area, the old percentages
will he completely off. The coaches
then will have to teach their players
to take long shots and not to worry
about anything else.
The defense will also have to be
radically different. Many teams are
now using a tight zone-defense. This
works in stopping plays from getting
in. but has no effect from over 20
feet out. All the teams will have to
shift into a man to man defense, and
the V>ld team play and coordination
will diminish.
Also, (he thrills whi c h make
basketball such a great sport will go
out. No longer will there he boys like
Ilank Luisetti. who have the skill to
elude the defense and go in for a
lay-up; no longer will there be spec
tacular plays in which a man out-of
nowheres breaks free to score. In
stead. two or three men will stand
out about 21 and a sixteenth feet
(to allow for the natural error of
the sight of the special referee who
watches for the spot from which a
shot is made) and pepper the basket.
And if our coach on leave and ex
bridge expert turned sports fan were
of the consistent type, they would
also see to it that all shots made from
beyond the center line were given
an extra bonus. Maybe our ex-bridge
expert turned sports fan could really
come to the front then. He could
score the ascending order of points
in the same ratio as down-two, dou
bled and vulnerable.
However, that might prove to be
a little confusing, and our boys would
want nothing like that. As we said
before, they just wished to change
the game a wee-bit.
Well, as the old saying goes, "Win
a few, lose a few."

Now if they change the scoring so
that two shots from 21 feet out are
worth three shots from anywhere
inside thai area, the old percentages
will he completely off. The coaches
then will have to teach their players
to take long shots and not to worry
about anything else.
The defense will also have to be
radically different. Many teams are
now using a tight zone-defense. This
works in stopping plays from getting
in. but has no effect from over 20
feet out. All the teams will have to
shift into a man to man defense, and
the V>ld team play and coordination
will diminish.

out about 21 and a sixteenth feet
(to allow for the natural error of

watches for the spot from which a
shot is made) and pepper the basket.
And if our coach on leave and ex

of the consistent type, they would
also see to it that all shots made from
beyond the center line were given
an extra bonus. Maybe our ex-bridge
expert turned sports fan could really
come to the front then. He could
score the ascending order of points
in the same ratio as down-two, dou

However, that might prove to be
a little confusing, and our boys would

before, they just wished to change
the game a wee-bit.
Well, as the old saying goes, "Win

It looks like we're not the only
ones who are looking around for
something to do in the field of sports,
for we have just read where a couple
of the boys, an Oregon coach on
leave and an ex-bridge expert turned
sports fan, have decided to add a
little to the game of basketball. At
least, they are sincere in their be
liefs.
All that they want to do. and they
have already talked Columbia and
Fordham into trying it out tonight,
is to change the system of scoring a
little. They feel that a person who
scores from more than 21 feet out
deserves an extra bonus, and that he
should receive three points instead
of the usual two. They have nothing
else against basketball and feel that
the game might survive if only one
other change were made; they want
to give the player taking the foul
shot the option of taking a chance
from 21 feet out and scoring two
points, or taking a shot from 12 feet
out (the foul line is now only six
feet from the basket) and registering
one point. And that is what they call
adding a little to the game.
We are sincerely surprised, al
though one could expert anything
from a bridge fiend. First of all, that
new scoring system would complete
ly change the concept of an offense.
In the last years, the offense has been
built around getting the hail in close
and taking a shot from there; it is

chance of connecting varies indirect
