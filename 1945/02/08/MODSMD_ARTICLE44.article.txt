# Bill Conley Tells Of Manila, 1940
## 
### 
Bill Conley, ex-Biz manager of
The Daily, lived and worked in Ma
nila as assistant merchandising man
ager for the largest and most modern
department store in the Far East
I from 1939 to 1940.
He arrived at work only a few
days after the eight-storied building,
the largest of the H. E. Heacock con
cern which had five branches
throughout the Philippines, had re
opened. It had been closed and re
! built due to fire and earthquake
damage done in 1936.
Native Frightened
It was rebuilt with every modern
convenience possible—air-condition
ing, magic eye doors, and so on. It
was so modern, related Bill, that
when a Philippine woman came in
from the provinces to do her shop
| ping, she stuck out her hand to open
| the door, the door flew open, and
she dropped on her knees and began
praying. She thought the world had
come to an end.
On the top floor of the building
was station KZRH. the Philippine
I radio station affiliated with NBC.
I Also on the top floor was the Ameri
can Chamber of Commerce. The store
was even more modern than any
I that could be found in San Francisco,
! added Bill.
Bargain Basement
Located on the "Great White Way"
of Manila, the Escolita, the building
I typified the showy Fifth Avenue
shops and the American interests
| and was the first store to introduce
I to the Far East the favorite Ameri
j can "bargain basement."
There were more modern theaters,
j too, continued Bill, in Manila than
| in San Francisco. There were five
| first run theaters, and about 35 sec
ond run, only three of which showed
Philippine movies.
Fur Coats Popular
The Philippines go for American
! movies, especially cowboy pictures.
; They attend the affairs with fur coats
! slung over their arms, wait till they
get in the lobby of the theater, then
j put the coats on. When they leave
; the theater, they take them off again,
i The theaters are air-conditioned and
! cool, outside it's hot and humid. "Just
backwards from San ' Francisco,'
| laughed Bill.
Modern Pier
Manila's harbor has one of the

world's greatest piers—modern, and
well equipped. It was large enough
to service the cargo of five average j
I size ocean-going vessels at one time.
Along the busy water-front also
lies the Far East's most luxurious
hotel, the Manila, which undoubted- j
ly was used by the Japanese high 1
command during their occupation of !
the town.
Buildings in Flames
Today the Heacock building, the
Manila Hotel, Pier 7. and the Escolita
are in flames, left to burn by Jripa- j
nese suicide squadrons as the soldiers
dashed to the south side of the Pasig 1
River to take cover in the old city
j of Manila.
The old city is walled in, and used
to have within its fort the slums, the
native quarter of the town, when
Bill was there. It was surrounded by |
' the golf course, park, and aquarium. 1
Harbor Useless
The sad part of all the destruction
is when it is all over the Americans !
j will be faced with the same problem
that the Japs had when they first
captured Manila. They will be unable
to use the harbor as Corriggdor is
in the hands of the Japs.
"There's no doubt," continued Bill,
"that industries in the Philippines, as
far as manufacturing or processing i
are concerned, will have to begin
from the bottom because all ma
chinery and factories have been de
stroyed and most American and
Philippine engineers who were at
Manila or in the Philippines during
the declaration of war joined either i
American or Philippine troops and
were either captured or killed.
There's a new frontier, with great
openings and very few employment
problems, opening up in the Philip
pines."
