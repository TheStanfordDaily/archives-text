# Stricken Campus Sees Return of Candle Light
## 
### 
Lust Monday night, while Stan
ford's temperamental kilocycles were
dueling at the power house, the en
tire campus got a taste of what
granny must have gone through
when she had to use grade C kero
sene in her lamp.
When the lights began to blink,

granny would merely have cussed
Lincahn and his mob of damyankees
for starting this heah wah anyhow,
and thrown the lamp out the win
dow. Stanford operated through the
entire blink-out, however.
Confusion resulted from the first
few blinks. In the freshman women's
dorms, groups of girls huddled in
shivered silence in the halls, while
their sponsors gave them courage by
telling tli e m what Little Annie
Rooney would do in a similar case.
Strength returned and they played
bridge in the best of Rooney form
by the light of candles in well
dripped brown and green bottles.
Those more studious individuals
who were at the civ libe when the
lights went out were the envy of the
campus—they screamed in the dark
with all their fiendish strength.
Work at the Daily Shack went on
by dramatic torch-light. The com
bined effect of the torches and blink
ing lights was quite convincing—one
emotional person was caught try
ing to climb inside the coke machine.
Then there was the Roble girl who
was taking a shower when the lights
went out. She was half drowned by
the time her roommates rescued her.
And the little glowworm just laughed
and laughed.
