# Barton Exhibit At Art Gallery
## 
### 
Paintings by Loren Barton now at
the Stanford University Art Gallery
1 are an unusual collection of her
work, having a directness and clarity
of vision in the use of color, and yet
j often giving an appearance of care
lessness and melodrama.
Of the 21 paintings which comprise
j the exhibition, the subject most
! prominent is Mexico and the Mexican
| people, a theme that Miss Barton
handles beautifully. She seems to be
able to portray the strong character
istics of the Mexican peasants with
' far more competence than she treats
j the several other subjects in the ex
| hibition.
Although most of the work in this
exhibition is done in water-color,
there are a few oils represented; they
j lack any individuality, however, and
| are rather theatrical in composition.
While her subject matter is often un
inspired, Miss Barton's sense of color
is evident in her watercolors espe
i cially. Her "Santa Paula Spring" re
veals the effect of graduated color,
while in "Storm Over the Desert" she
! uses harsher combinations to create
! the desired effect.
The present exhibition, which came
j to Stanford on February 5, is from
the Dalzell Hatfield Collection of
| Los Angeles, and will remain here
1 through February 25, from 10 a.m. to
1 5 p.m. daily, without charge to visi-
