Great universities can never be
established "so far from the centers
of civilization and culture." This
statement was characteristic of the
general opinion expressed when Le
land Stanford announced his plan for
converting his Palo Alto Ranch into
a college.
The entire story of how this op
position was changed to acclamation
for the new Stanford University and
its founder is unfolded in the exhibit
now being shown in the main library-
Photographs, newspaper clippings,
and old publications tell the pic
turesque history of the Farm.
Grant Drawn Up in ISH(>
Leland Stanford requested Gen
eral Francis A. Walker, an educator
of the last century, to inspect uni
versities throughout Europe and the
United States. The original plans of
the new institution were changed
several times. F. L. Olmsted, a sur
veyor who planned the layout of
Central Park in New York, chose
the site for the university. In 1886
Leland Stanford drew up the found
ing grant which is now kept in a
safe on campus.
Cornerstone Contains Souvenirs
On May 14, 1887, the cornerstone
was laid. In future years, if it is
opened, many interesting souvenirs
of the Stanford family and of the
history of the Farm's founding will
be discovered. The stone contains,
among other things, a photograph of
Leland Stanford Jr., one of each type
of the coins issued in 1887, and a
small box of keepsakes known only
to Mrs. Stanford.
Now that the university was
actually being built, newspapers ran
long articles on Leland Stanford,
"the leading man of California." Re
porters outdid themselves with ad
jectives describing Senator Stanford.
He was "aggressive, progressive,
traveled, studious, generous." Cali
fox-nia was proud of the new uni
versity and its founder.
465 Students Enrolled
At last the great day, October 1,
1891, arrived. With 465 students, a
faculty of 14, and David Starr Jor
dan as president, Leland Stanford
Jr. University opened. The excercises
of the opening day included a speech
by the founder who said that the
aims of the institution were to give
a rounded education, to promote free

scholarships, to insure co-equality
of the sexes, and to encourage re- |
ligious activities by the building of I
a chapel.
The inner quad did not yet contain j
Stanford's famous church. New;> j
papers all over the state devoted en
tire editions to the new university.
One of these papers, the San Jose J
Daily Mercury, is now on exhibit at |
the library.
Stanford Family
Besides depicting the founding of |
the Farm, the exhibit contains inter- j
esting sidelights on the Stanford i
family. Their personal scrapbooks of
newspaper articles which tell about
concerts and visitors at the Palo Alto
Ranch are on exhibit. Several books
written about Stanford and those
written by David Starr Jordan are
being displayed. Added to these fea
tures are pictures showing the actual j
building of the university. The ex- I
hibit is scheduled to last about three ;
' weeks.

statement was characteristic of the
general opinion expressed when Le
land Stanford announced his plan for
converting his Palo Alto Ranch into
a college.
The entire story of how this op
position was changed to acclamation
for the new Stanford University and
its founder is unfolded in the exhibit
now being shown in the main library-
Photographs, newspaper clippings,
and old publications tell the pic
turesque history of the Farm.
Grant Drawn Up in ISH(>
Leland Stanford requested Gen
eral Francis A. Walker, an educator
of the last century, to inspect uni
versities throughout Europe and the
United States. The original plans of
the new institution were changed
several times. F. L. Olmsted, a sur
veyor who planned the layout of
Central Park in New York, chose
the site for the university. In 1886
Leland Stanford drew up the found
ing grant which is now kept in a
safe on campus.
Cornerstone Contains Souvenirs
On May 14, 1887, the cornerstone
was laid. In future years, if it is
opened, many interesting souvenirs
of the Stanford family and of the
history of the Farm's founding will
be discovered. The stone contains,
among other things, a photograph of
Leland Stanford Jr., one of each type
of the coins issued in 1887, and a
small box of keepsakes known only
to Mrs. Stanford.
Now that the university was
actually being built, newspapers ran
long articles on Leland Stanford,
"the leading man of California." Re
porters outdid themselves with ad
jectives describing Senator Stanford.
He was "aggressive, progressive,
traveled, studious, generous." Cali
fox-nia was proud of the new uni
versity and its founder.
465 Students Enrolled
At last the great day, October 1,
1891, arrived. With 465 students, a
faculty of 14, and David Starr Jor
dan as president, Leland Stanford
Jr. University opened. The excercises
of the opening day included a speech
by the founder who said that the
aims of the institution were to give
a rounded education, to promote free

scholarships, to insure co-equality
of the sexes, and to encourage re- |
ligious activities by the building of I
a chapel.
The inner quad did not yet contain j
Stanford's famous church. New;> j
papers all over the state devoted en
tire editions to the new university.
One of these papers, the San Jose J
Daily Mercury, is now on exhibit at |
the library.
Stanford Family
Besides depicting the founding of |
the Farm, the exhibit contains inter- j
esting sidelights on the Stanford i
family. Their personal scrapbooks of
newspaper articles which tell about
concerts and visitors at the Palo Alto
Ranch are on exhibit. Several books
written about Stanford and those
written by David Starr Jordan are
being displayed. Added to these fea
tures are pictures showing the actual j
building of the university. The ex- I
hibit is scheduled to last about three ;
' weeks.
