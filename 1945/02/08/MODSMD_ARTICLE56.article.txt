# Speech 9 Is 'Inevitable'
## 
### ROD BROWNING 
Offering a key for future Barry
mores and Cornells, prospective poli
ticians and Chicago ward bosses, and
hopeful business students, the Speech
9 course is one of those inevitable
subjects every student ends up tak
ing before graduating.
Some enter the course with a shin
ing picture of themselves explaining
their own fifth dimensional theory to
the rest of the class. Fate and the
Speech Department however, have
planned something better for this
type of Pericles-in-the-rough.
Breath control, voice quality and
variety, relaxation, and posture are
the usual problems; and they can be
solved only by intensive practice.
One of the breath control exer
cises consists of counting aloud as
far as possible on one breath. For
relaxation they do a "rag doll act."
There are also many chances for
individual talks during the course.
For the first speech the usual stu
dent gives a description of his home
town. The professor then comments
on any defects, which may include
the following: too breathy, an er
ratic lisp or a tendency to overlook
the l's entirely.
By the end of the quarter the
average member of the flock finds
himself able to hold his audiences
spell-bound.
