# Gas Man Says We Are Honest
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
An interesting campus personality
and a man well liked by his cus
tomers, is Walter Heinecke, manager
of our own service station here on
the campus. Walt has had the station
for about eight years now, and runs I
it independently, whereas it once
was subordinate to the Fire House
next door.
Having previously controlled the
Stadium Service Station on the high
way, Walt makes a complimentary
comparison for the students between
that and his present Stanford sta
tion.
"In all my years here nothing has
ever been stolen or even missing."
Walt likes student trade and enjoys
working for the students more than
for anyone, and in days past he even
used to cash checks for adventurous
students just preparing to depart on
a long weekend trip (having stocked
it up first with that rare stuff).
He claims he never lost a dime on
these last minute financial deals,
but was always recompensed the
next week or so, if the fellahs didn't
have any money in the bank.
But those good old days are gone,
at least for the present, and Walt
says the students now are more
conscious than ever of their tires
and batteries, and although his gas
sales are just about half of what
they were before the war, he still
does the same amount of main
tenance work.
At least the war, with all its draw
backs, has entirely eliminated "those
bothersome 10 and 15 cent gas sales,
so common years ago when one of
the partners who owned a car would
buy just enough gas to get him to
town and back. But now, customers
have to buy at least a tickets' worth.
Right now Walt has two student

assistants who work in the after
noons, "Rusty" Gates and Marshall
Hjelte.
Walt is a Stanford man, from the
class of '31. He was an Eton major
and he played Frosh football, and
then Varsity three years as center.
He also played in the Rose Bowl
against Pittsburgh in 1928.
