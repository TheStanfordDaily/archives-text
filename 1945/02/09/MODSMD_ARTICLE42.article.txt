# THE
						"BIG THREE"
## 
### 
In 1995 in Stanford's History of Western Civ
ilization some bricj-t young frosh will know
more than we can say today about the location
and the significance of the meeting of the "big
three," Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt, in the
Black Sea area.
The drama of having the three most power
ful men in the world conferring about the means
to secure a lasting peace has been intensified
by the crash of a plane carrying ten of Mr.
Churchill's aides, killing all of them. Realizing
the risk that these meetings incur, the effec
tiveness of the meetings must justify them.
The purpose to be served by these meetings
is, in the final analysis, a cold-blooded one of
political forces. Britain and Russia are con
flicting political forces in the Balkans. If the'
United States can exhibit its intent to be an ac
tive force in the world after the war it may be
able to effect the necessary compromises there.
The United States and Russia seem to be at
conflict over whethei or not the central coun
cil of the postwar organization outlined at
Dumbarton Oaks must act only by unanimous
vote of first-rate powers. In this conflict Brit
ain is the influence to bring a working com
promise or at least lend its weight toward its
decision, and it is said that the situation looks
very hopeful of compromise.
Again in the issue of the future of the Pacific
lands decisions by all three powers, if not by
more, are necessary for securing the peace.
As the collapse of Germany seems imminent,
problems of occupation and punishment, though
much discussed, do not seem to be carefully
planned. It should be the basic hope for con
siderations of the long-range effect of this peace
that all treatment of Germany should breed as
few scars as possible, real or psychological,
that will impede the justice and sanity of the
German people's post-war existence.
The force of tradition, respect, and knowledge
of the potency of Anglo-Saxon law should be
introduced as much as possible in occupied
territories. In the hot spots of the Balkans the
local sympathies in many countries seem
clearly to be with Russia, and in France there
seems to be considerable intolerance for the
early hesitancy of the United States and its slow
recognition of De Gaulle. If the United States
and Britain wish to modify Russian influence
they will do well probably to contribute and
insist upon the careful observation of their
conservative law. Both the newly improvised
system of Russian government and Russia's
immediate proximity to Fascist recklessness
will tend to create a reciprocal recklessness
that would surely impair our hopes of a useful
world citizenship for the German nation.
It is one of the most deplorable things that
a "just peace" and a "soft peace" are being
considered synon/mous.
The presence of lames Byrnes at the confer
ence is the hope of Americans that the Senate
will feel that the work of the conference will
be brought back to them by some one who
understands their interests in it. The unreason
able political conflicts and bitterly fought side
issues of the last v/ar's peace undermined our
own and European confidence in Uncle Sam.
The work of these leaders can certainly make
a balanced and sane policy in the war as well
as clarify certain broad policies to dispel rumor
and confusion. Their apparent confidence and
consistent discussions should be a hopeful sign
for the effectiveness of fair and democratic
processes to solve the most grave and far
reaching problems.
