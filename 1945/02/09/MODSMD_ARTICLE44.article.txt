' Dear Editoi':
For the benefit of certain adolescent elements of
our local dance police, belter known as the Junior Ges
tapo, I wish to enlighten said same on the subject
"Wearing of Uniform by Retired Army Officers."
If they can, and are willing to read the following,
perhaps some other struggling student whose aim is
not to deceive, but to save a scoot here and there, may
be spared the embarrassment and humiliation my wife
i and I suffered last Saturday night at the Toyon Formal,
! known by me as the Toyon Terror!
I quote from A.R. (Army Regulations) 600-40, para-
I graph 23, b, 1: "Reserve officers, not on active status,
I within the continental United States and possessions,
{ may wear the uniform at (1) ceremonial occasions of a
military character, (2) social functions. (3) informal
gatherings of a military nature."
Certainly, last Saturday night's fiasco filled all three
of these requirements before the night was over. I not
only could see the gleam in their eyes as they followed
me around the dance floor, but also could feel their
hot breath (haly) on my neck as they gathered in
groups to discuss the capture.
Undoubtedly they could see the headlines "Junior
G-men Catch Student Impersonating an Officer." I am,
and will remain, an officer, until by direction of the
President I am relieved of that obligation.
As for the practical question, "Why do I wear the
uniform?" my answer is relatively simple. Why in
(censored) should I put out good dough for a tuxedo,
when I have already invested about $200 in my uni
form? Besides, I hate to wear a tuxedo.
However, forewarned is forearmed, and next week
I will come amply provided with a small briefcase,
containing my commission, orders, retirement proceed
ings, dog-tags, identifying pictures (front and side
view), and perhaps even my GI 45 Colt automatic.
(Sidearms for dismounted officer's, AR 600-40.)
In the words of the immortal Tiny Tim, my wife
and I emphatically repeat, "What guts!"
