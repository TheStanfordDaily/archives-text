Dear Editor:
The war has killed isolationism, it has been said.
Co-operation is the watchword of the dayâ€”co-opera
tion between democratic nations to win the Four Free
doms for the whole world. Never would America wish
to sit in smug prosperity, deaf to the pleas for help
from distant shores.
The true spirit of our country is expressed by the
inscription on the Statue of* Liberty. And, while our
nation was founded as a refuge for the oppressed of
other lands, we cannot forget those left behind, both in
Europe and Asia.
"We must not lose the peace," we are frequently
warned. This spirit of co-operation must extend after
the war, if we are to be truly secure. Already at Dum
barton Oaks, tentative plans for world government
were made. China has a still better plan for the estab
lishment of a "just and durable peace."
Yet now, before the peace is consummated, it is
proposed that Congress act, without regard to the
plans of any other nation, to pass a permanent peace
time conscription bill. How could we commit so ruth
less an act of isolationism?
A few years ago, when we found ourselves being
called the "Colossus of the North" by the South Ameri
can republics, we eagerly sought to remedy that un
pleasant and unprofitable situation by adopting the
Good Neighbor policy. Do we wish now to become an
armed Colossus, feared and hated by the whole world,
or shall we not rather extend the "good neighbor"
policy to a universal scale, and in the spirit of Lincoln,
"bind up" humanity's "wounds."
Very truly yours,
Elsie R. Renne
