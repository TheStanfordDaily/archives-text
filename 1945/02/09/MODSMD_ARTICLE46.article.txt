For some weeks now I have been reprinting in this
column extracts from a book entitled "The Memoirs ol
John Bell." forty-second President of the United States.
This volume claims to be printed in the year 2000 A.D.
I have lost patience with this stuff. In fact I now
strongly suspect a hoax. It seems probable that these
alleged Memoirs are not what they appear.
Let us take for example the style in which they are
written. Anguished readers of the Daily have entreated
me to explain what it is about. The words are too long,
according to Jim Brannerman (Toyon freshman). The
style is pedantic, according to Bill Gilbert (Chappie
business manager).
They are perfectly right. I will go further than they
do—l seriously doubt if the language is English at all.
I have not come across anything like it in my reading,
and I have a wide taste in reading too. I read Bull
Session, the editorials and the impassioned exhortations
of my co-columnist, the Caterpillar. John Bell doesn't
write in a style like these.
Then take the errors in fact. John Bell, himself, for
example. John Bell is a real person. He is a freshman
at Tyler Hall. I asked him if he was going to be the
forty-second President of the United States and pub
lish his memoirs in (he year 2000 A.D. He said he
wasn't. He said there would be no point in writing his
memoirs, since they were already published. The
whole thing is very confusing and suspicious.
There are other matters too. Ray Wissler was de
scribed as a future president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. When I asked Ray about this, he threw a
book at me. It was called "Das Kapitnl" by Karl Marx.
I took this as a sign indicating a negative answer.
In another place these alleged Memoirs refer 1o
Elliot Epsteen as "now unknown." I asked Epsteen it
he was going to be unknown. He assured me in the
strongest possible terms that he was destined for a
brilliant future, that his abilities assured him of a place
in history and that his name would be both known
and respected. He saijJ a great deal more along the
same lines, but that is enough to throw further doubt
on the accuracy of "The Memoirs of John Bell."
Finally I asked Bob Hildreth (remember Sir Rob
ert Jaekson-Hildreth?) if he was going to be a Regius
Professor of History at Oxford University. In reply
Bob pointed to his Bawl-Out average and assured me
that History was ihe subject that had brought it to its
present shocking position (look it up for yourself, dear
reader).
In spite of these glaring errors of fact I am willing
to give "The Memoirs of John Bell" a fair hearing.
I'll reprint some more extracts but I want my public
to know that I for one don't believe a word of it.
