# War Time Comedy Called Drab Story
## 
### 
THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU—
now playing at the Stanford The
ater.
Former Daily Editor Dave Davis
used to always call Pasadena the
"city of sin." After seeing "The

Very Thought of
You," which is
laid in that me
tropolis of the
south, this re
viewer is in
clined to agree.
For never has a
more sordid and
drab story mas
queraded as a
"romantic com
edy."

Sergeant Dennis Morgan, after
two yeai's in the Aleutians, receives
a three-day pass, during which time
he meets an old college friend, Elea
nor Parker. Morgan is lonely and
evidently Miss Parker has nothing
better to do, so the couple consume
many hundred feet of film philoso

phizing on the sad state of the world.
All of this can only lead to one
thing—the usual whirlwind mar
riage, carried on amid the nerve
grating protests of Miss Parker's
family. Alter a 12-hour honeymoon,
Morgan's three-day pass expires,
along with this reviewer's patience.
The last part of the film develops
into a study in temptation, with Miss
Parker's sister urging her to forget
Morgan and accept the "drink and
be merry" way of life. The outcome
of this "romantic comedy" we shall
leave for you to witness. Heaven
have mercy upon you.
The second feature is a Paramount
production entitled "Dangerous Pas
sage." You can easily realize that
"Dangerous Passage" is full of trite
cliches and roughhouse activity that
is designed for the .shipyard work
ers' trade.—Dick Bower
