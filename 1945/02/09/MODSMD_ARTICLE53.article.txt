### BILL ADAMS 
It is a common saying that man
is never satisfied. His constant desire
for improvement, for something bet
ter than what he has, is said to be
the basis for our high degree of
technical civilization; albeit this same
desire is also responsible in large
measure for the prevalence of social
disorganization in our society.
Whatever the results of this hu
man characteristic, it manifests it
self in a great many ways in a
variety of fields. One of the less
important of these fields, especially
recently, has been the field of sports.
Someone is always trying to alter
existing rules or modes of play in
our modern athletics to improve the
game, either from a players or from
a spectator's standpoint. Since these
two points of view often differ and
are frequently even opposites, sug
gested changes rarely get as far as
the rule-book; nevertheless, the agi
tation is always there.
Suggestions
Recent suggestions as to changes
in the rules of our major sports have
included some unbelievably far
fetched notions, from the conserva
tive point of view. There have also
been some lesser and quite practical
ideas, a few of which have been
adopted; particularly in the field of
professional football, which caters
particularly to the spectator's de
sires.
It has been suggested that a batter
be allowed to run to either first or
third base as he chooses after hitting
a ball in baseball. Since the base
runners would have to advance in
the same direction as the hitters,
obvious complications appear. Sup
pose a player gets a scratch single,
barely makes second on a too-late
relay in a double play, and then
steals third in a close play. Well and
good; the stands applaud, and the
batter is feeling pleased with him
self for having gotten into scoring
position, especially since he had to
work for it. We can imagine his feel
ings when the man at the plate drib
bles one down the first base-line
and calmly sets out for third. The
poor runner has technically gotten
no farther than first and has to go
through it all over again. Under this
system a base-runner might be kept
shuttling back and forth between
first and third for half an hour, while
other runners score on either side
of him.
Changes Adopted
Most of the suggestions concern
ing football have been minor and
have been unofficially adopted in
one section or another, such as out
lawing the out-of-bounds kickoff
and allowing passing from any point
behind the line of scrimmage. Box
ing, too, could stand improvement

from the point of view of the fan.
i A recent evidence of this in the state
I of California was the elimination of
the three-man judging committee on
fights in favor of giving the referee
sole authority to proclaim the victor.
An attempt also to substitute a round
enclosure for the traditional square
boxing ring proved unsuccessful last
year.
Those of us who read Mort Cohen's
brilliant opus, under the unique
heading "Sideline Slants" yesterday,
learned of an attempt to revolu
tionize basketball by allowing more
points for a score from further out
on the floor, as well as giving a man
awarded a free-throw a chance to
sink an easy one for one point or a
tough one for two points. Now this,
in our opinion, is going too far. We
don't mind if they change the shape
of the back-board (a horse-shoe like
board with rounded corners and
lower protrusions below the basket
has been approved in some Eastern
leagues), but there is such a thing
as putting too much emphasis on
individual performance. The same is
true of the previously mentioned
suggested change in baseball pro
cedure.
Why Not?
As Mort himself suggested, who go
half-way about this thing? If we're
going to start with radical measures,
why not carry them all the way
i through? Why not allow four points
; for a basket tossed from back of the
mid-zone? In football, why not allow
six points for a touchdown when the
! line of scrimmage is within the 10-
i yard line, seven between the 10 and
the 20, eight between the 20 and the
30, and so on. Or better still, we
could figure it out mathematically
and double or even square the num
ber of points awarded for a score
for each additional yard from the
goal line which the ball rests on at
the start of the play. The thing has
endless possibilities. In baseball we
might give four points for a home
run, three points for a runner who
scores from first, etc. We ought, of
course, to knock off half a point for
sliding home. In track the number of
points for first place might be con
trolled by the runner's time.
All this undoubtedly sounds very
foolish, and it is, but no more so
actually than the original suggestion.
For it is the theory behind these far
fetched ideas that is foolish. In mak
ing the above alterations we would
only be carrying the theory all the
way through.
That's Why
Football, basketball, baseball, and
even to some extent track, are team
sports. It is team-work that has
made them and keeps them what
they are. Perhaps few fans realize
it, but the coordinated team-work of
these games is the thrilling element
in them. Take away this element and
[ the game degenerates into nothing
! more than a rough-and-tumble com-
I petition for individual honors, as
' much between members of one squad
| as between one team and another,
j Apparently players themselves real
ize this much more readily than fans,
[ for suggestions involving more em
! phasis on individual play are far
j less frequently adopted than mere
J suggested technical changes.
Team-work and coordination are
| the basis as much for a happy and
j successful life as for the popularity
of a sport. The Army and the Navy
can well attest their value in the
present conflict. In this way com
petition in athletics where the em
phasis is laid more on the inter-ac
i tion of the group than on the actions

and the world's future. Let's keep

Suggestions
Recent suggestions as to changes
in the rules of our major sports have
included some unbelievably far
fetched notions, from the conserva
tive point of view. There have also
been some lesser and quite practical
ideas, a few of which have been
adopted; particularly in the field of
professional football, which caters
particularly to the spectator's de
sires.
It has been suggested that a batter
be allowed to run to either first or
third base as he chooses after hitting
a ball in baseball. Since the base
runners would have to advance in
the same direction as the hitters,
obvious complications appear. Sup
pose a player gets a scratch single,
barely makes second on a too-late
relay in a double play, and then
steals third in a close play. Well and
good; the stands applaud, and the
batter is feeling pleased with him
self for having gotten into scoring
position, especially since he had to
work for it. We can imagine his feel
ings when the man at the plate drib
bles one down the first base-line
and calmly sets out for third. The
poor runner has technically gotten
no farther than first and has to go
through it all over again. Under this
system a base-runner might be kept
shuttling back and forth between
first and third for half an hour, while
other runners score on either side
of him.
Changes Adopted
Most of the suggestions concern
ing football have been minor and
have been unofficially adopted in
one section or another, such as out
lawing the out-of-bounds kickoff
and allowing passing from any point
behind the line of scrimmage. Box
ing, too, could stand improvement

from the point of view of the fan.
i A recent evidence of this in the state
I of California was the elimination of
the three-man judging committee on
fights in favor of giving the referee
sole authority to proclaim the victor.
An attempt also to substitute a round
enclosure for the traditional square
boxing ring proved unsuccessful last
year.
Those of us who read Mort Cohen's
brilliant opus, under the unique
heading "Sideline Slants" yesterday,
learned of an attempt to revolu
tionize basketball by allowing more
points for a score from further out
on the floor, as well as giving a man
awarded a free-throw a chance to
sink an easy one for one point or a
tough one for two points. Now this,
in our opinion, is going too far. We
don't mind if they change the shape
of the back-board (a horse-shoe like
board with rounded corners and
lower protrusions below the basket
has been approved in some Eastern
leagues), but there is such a thing
as putting too much emphasis on
individual performance. The same is
true of the previously mentioned
suggested change in baseball pro
cedure.
Why Not?
As Mort himself suggested, who go
half-way about this thing? If we're
going to start with radical measures,
why not carry them all the way
i through? Why not allow four points
; for a basket tossed from back of the
mid-zone? In football, why not allow
six points for a touchdown when the
! line of scrimmage is within the 10-
i yard line, seven between the 10 and
the 20, eight between the 20 and the
30, and so on. Or better still, we
could figure it out mathematically
and double or even square the num
ber of points awarded for a score
for each additional yard from the
goal line which the ball rests on at
the start of the play. The thing has
endless possibilities. In baseball we
might give four points for a home
run, three points for a runner who
scores from first, etc. We ought, of
course, to knock off half a point for
sliding home. In track the number of
points for first place might be con
trolled by the runner's time.
All this undoubtedly sounds very
foolish, and it is, but no more so
actually than the original suggestion.
For it is the theory behind these far
fetched ideas that is foolish. In mak
ing the above alterations we would
only be carrying the theory all the
way through.
That's Why
Football, basketball, baseball, and
even to some extent track, are team
sports. It is team-work that has
made them and keeps them what
they are. Perhaps few fans realize
it, but the coordinated team-work of
these games is the thrilling element
in them. Take away this element and
[ the game degenerates into nothing
! more than a rough-and-tumble com-
I petition for individual honors, as
' much between members of one squad
| as between one team and another,
j Apparently players themselves real
ize this much more readily than fans,
[ for suggestions involving more em

Team-work and coordination are

can well attest their value in the

team-work where it is!
It is a common saying that man
is never satisfied. His constant desire
for improvement, for something bet
ter than what he has, is said to be
the basis for our high degree of
technical civilization; albeit this same
desire is also responsible in large
measure for the prevalence of social
disorganization in our society.
Whatever the results of this hu
man characteristic, it manifests it
self in a great many ways in a
variety of fields. One of the less
important of these fields, especially
recently, has been the field of sports.
Someone is always trying to alter

barely makes second on a too-late
relay in a double play, and then
steals third in a close play. Well and
good; the stands applaud, and the
batter is feeling pleased with him
self for having gotten into scoring
position, especially since he had to
work for it. We can imagine his feel
ings when the man at the plate drib
bles one down the first base-line
and calmly sets out for third. The
poor runner has technically gotten
no farther than first and has to go
through it all over again. Under this
system a base-runner might be kept
shuttling back and forth between
first and third for half an hour, while
other runners score on either side
of him.
Changes Adopted
Most of the suggestions concern
ing football have been minor and
have been unofficially adopted in
one section or another, such as out
lawing the out-of-bounds kickoff
and allowing passing from any point
behind the line of scrimmage. Box
ing, too, could stand improvement

from the point of view of the fan.
i A recent evidence of this in the state
I of California was the elimination of
the three-man judging committee on
fights in favor of giving the referee
sole authority to proclaim the victor.
An attempt also to substitute a round
enclosure for the traditional square
boxing ring proved unsuccessful last
year.
Those of us who read Mort Cohen's
brilliant opus, under the unique
heading "Sideline Slants" yesterday,
learned of an attempt to revolu
tionize basketball by allowing more
points for a score from further out
on the floor, as well as giving a man
awarded a free-throw a chance to
sink an easy one for one point or a
tough one for two points. Now this,
in our opinion, is going too far. We
don't mind if they change the shape
of the back-board (a horse-shoe like
board with rounded corners and
lower protrusions below the basket
has been approved in some Eastern
leagues), but there is such a thing
as putting too much emphasis on
individual performance. The same is
true of the previously mentioned
suggested change in baseball pro
cedure.
Why Not?
As Mort himself suggested, who go
half-way about this thing? If we're
going to start with radical measures,
why not carry them all the way
i through? Why not allow four points
; for a basket tossed from back of the
mid-zone? In football, why not allow
six points for a touchdown when the
! line of scrimmage is within the 10-
i yard line, seven between the 10 and
the 20, eight between the 20 and the
30, and so on. Or better still, we
could figure it out mathematically
and double or even square the num
ber of points awarded for a score
for each additional yard from the
goal line which the ball rests on at
the start of the play. The thing has
endless possibilities. In baseball we
might give four points for a home
run, three points for a runner who
scores from first, etc. We ought, of
course, to knock off half a point for
sliding home. In track the number of
points for first place might be con
trolled by the runner's time.
All this undoubtedly sounds very
foolish, and it is, but no more so
actually than the original suggestion.
For it is the theory behind these far
fetched ideas that is foolish. In mak
ing the above alterations we would
only be carrying the theory all the
way through.
That's Why
Football, basketball, baseball, and
even to some extent track, are team
sports. It is team-work that has
made them and keeps them what
they are. Perhaps few fans realize
it, but the coordinated team-work of
these games is the thrilling element
in them. Take away this element and
[ the game degenerates into nothing
! more than a rough-and-tumble com-
I petition for individual honors, as
' much between members of one squad
| as between one team and another,
j Apparently players themselves real
ize this much more readily than fans,
[ for suggestions involving more em
! phasis on individual play are far
j less frequently adopted than mere
J suggested technical changes.
Team-work and coordination are
| the basis as much for a happy and
j successful life as for the popularity
of a sport. The Army and the Navy
can well attest their value in the

phasis is laid more on the inter-ac

team-work where it is!
It is a common saying that man
is never satisfied. His constant desire
for improvement, for something bet
ter than what he has, is said to be
the basis for our high degree of
technical civilization; albeit this same
desire is also responsible in large
measure for the prevalence of social
disorganization in our society.
Whatever the results of this hu
man characteristic, it manifests it
self in a great many ways in a
variety of fields. One of the less
important of these fields, especially
recently, has been the field of sports.
Someone is always trying to alter
existing rules or modes of play in
our modern athletics to improve the
game, either from a players or from
a spectator's standpoint. Since these
two points of view often differ and
are frequently even opposites, sug
gested changes rarely get as far as
the rule-book; nevertheless, the agi
tation is always there.
Suggestions
Recent suggestions as to changes
in the rules of our major sports have
included some unbelievably far
fetched notions, from the conserva
tive point of view. There have also
been some lesser and quite practical
ideas, a few of which have been
adopted; particularly in the field of
professional football, which caters
particularly to the spectator's de
sires.
It has been suggested that a batter
be allowed to run to either first or
third base as he chooses after hitting
a ball in baseball. Since the base
runners would have to advance in
the same direction as the hitters,
obvious complications appear. Sup
pose a player gets a scratch single,
barely makes second on a too-late
relay in a double play, and then
steals third in a close play. Well and
