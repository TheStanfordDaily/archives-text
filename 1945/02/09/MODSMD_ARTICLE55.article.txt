# Independents To Play Army
## 
### 
Dave Brown's Palo Alto Independ
ents, sparked by the consistent scor
ing of Morley Thompson, will take
on the Army All-Stars in the Palo
Alio High gym tomorrow night at
7:30. The All-Stars, composed of
former basketball wizards, plan to
give the Independents a tough bat
tle in their "grudge" game.
Palo Alto will start Thompson and
George Bower at forwards, Jack
Heald at center, and Brown and Ed
Douglas at guards, the same team
that almost downed Chapel of the
Oaks in San Francisco last Sunday.
Brown indicated that a charity
affair with Auten's of Palo Alto and
with St. Mary's Pre-Flight are defi
nitely scheduled for the next two
successive week-ends. Tomorrow
night's admission will be free.
