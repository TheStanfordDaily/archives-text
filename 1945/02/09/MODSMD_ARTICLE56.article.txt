# BWOC's Give Activity Tips at Leaders' Meet
## 
### MARION MORROW 
Outstanding characteristic of the
"Y" leadership meeting yesterday
was the emphasis on clean-up com
mittees, innumerable lost elections,
and numerous dictatorial Daily head
copy editors.
Barbara White, A.S.S.U. president,
told how she had begun her activity
on-campus life by being publicity
chairman of a dance, running for
several W.A.A. offices and losing,
getting on the Rally Committee, los
ing a Y.W.C.A. election, and finally
getting on Cardinals. From here she
received her opportunity to a nomi
nation for Farm president.
She emphasized the importance of
liking activities. "Prestige and name
isn't an end in itself, but should be
acknowledgment and reward," she
added.
Start in Living Group
Marian Johnson, Y.W.C.A. presi
dent, began her career on clean-up
committees, went on to become a
Roble sponsor, lost a W.A.A. presi
dential election, continued with
some more clean-up committees, ran
for "Y" president and won.
Her grades improved a great deal,
she mentioned, as soon as she be
came busier. She, too, emphasized
the need for an interest, and the
necessity of letting your living group
leaders know you're interested in
activities.
'Bigger and Better Things'
Jeannette Grimsley, War Board
co-ordinator, has never been on a
clean-up committee, but began by
being a stamp representative for
War Board. She went on to bigger
and better things by becoming so
cial co-ordinator, head of the USO,
and finally War Board co-ordinator.
"Of real importance," she com
mented, "is the ability to take criti
cism and attempt to work it into
your plans, yet be able to stick by
your ideas if you think they're
right."
Connie Frank, Women's Council
chairman, was a Red Cross repre
sentative in her younger days, and
got started in Council work by be
ing on the Lagunita Committee of
Seven. She was elected Council
chairman last fall after having
served as a member all summer,
"You must realize that your job
must be done well after it is at
tained," she concluded.
Develop Activity Interest
Bernadette Giannini, Daily editor,
attributed her success entirely to
the war dilemma, and confessed to
her beginnings as a cub reporter.
She told what fun it had been to
work up to night editor, when she
was master.
"What many college activities
lack," she continued, "is the pres
sure to keep you doing things. The
Daily supplies this pressure."
"The whole attitude of leadership

is to care about what you're doing,
to develop an interest in it," she
ended.
