# Roughs Send Aid to That Man Of Men--'The Ding Dong Daddy'
## 
### ROD BROWNING 
San Francisco's Francis Van Wie, alias "the Ding Dong Daddy," has 1
been placed temporarily on the martyr list by various Stanford students !
for his efforts to re-establish masculine supremacy in the world. When
Van Wies' matrimonial escapades were uncovered, contributions were col
lected at Toyon from several men's halls around campus and sent to aid

that man of men, Van Wie, in his"
struggle with justice.
Co-chairmen of the mqvement at
Toyon, Ray Ryan and Eel Hall, claim
that the total contribution was
around $20. But the "Ding Dong
Daddy" enthusiasm around campus
has shown a marked decline since
Van Wie has been cpoling his heels
in the San Francisco City Jail.
The letter accompanying the con
tributions sent in by the Stanford
men summed up the sympathizers'
views on the subject as follows: "It
is our belief that Van Wie was mere
ly the victim of circumstances, and
it is our fond hope that this small
contribution will help him return to
the peace and contentment he ob
viously desires."
As yet none of the women's halls
on campus have formed "Ding Dong
Daddy Clubs." This no doubt indi
cates an extreme lack of sympathy
by Stanford women for Van Wie
and the revival of polygamy.
Investigation into Van Wie's thrill
ing past shows that he has been a
lion trainer, WPA worker, street car
conductor, a pseudo secret service
investigator, and, of course, a lady's
man.
Whether Van Wie is the victim of
circumstances and feminine charms,
or whether he is just a super Cali
fornia wolf, his chances for avoiding
a long stay behind bars are very
small indeed.
