# River, Stay 'Way from My Door!
## 
### PAT MOONEY 
Did you have trouble last week
getting your rowboat launched on
the great Lasuen River to scull to
your 8 o'clock? Or were you one of
the poor unfortunates who nearly
drowned trying to swim from the
Cellar to the P. 0.? Were you—oh
horrible fate —almost blown down
the highway to Dinah's by the rag
ing gale that was tearing great hunks
off the trees?
If you caught a thorough-going
case of pneumonia or sinus which
is still making you talk like a fog
horn, don't feel that it was all in
vain. For every little drop of liquid
sunshine that trickled down your

neck making you long for a good,
cozy fire and a hot toddy, there was
a corresponding drop that fell into
the Lagunita Mud-Puddle, trans
forming it from a disgusting and
slushy mess into a thing of true
beauty.
Lake Rises
This eagle-eyed observer, who has
crow's-feet around her eyes from
gazing speculatively at great bodies
of water and gauging the breezes
thereon, states that we lack only
about three feet of muddy, yellow
water to have a full-fledged lake at
our back doors.
Hourly trips of observation have
been made during the past few days,
and on the last excursion—when the

final few drops of rain were drifting
down —there was actually a bridge
game in progress on the docks, and
one over-eager and definitely over
optimistic young female in a bath
ing suit who was trying to get a
tan.
Great Things Promised
I wasn't close enough to see her
but from a distance
it was a good picture as a promise
of great things to come—hot sun,
countless equally hot bridge games
going, portable radios blaring forth,
and that wonderful escape from the
drudgery of studying.
Those of us who are sun-worship
pers and escapists from toil (and who
isn't?) are girding ourselves for the

great battle which will come after
the ASSU office has proclaimed the
open season, and everyone this side
of the border rushes madly lake
ward, knocking down and trampling
under foot any infidel who dares get
in the way.
So if'The Rains come again, as the
weatherman seems to think they will,
don't feel that life is a snare, trap,
and delusion created by the Cali
fornia Chamber of Commerce. Glory
in the whipping, cold wind and mis
erable driving rain. Three more
beautiful feet of the stuff that is only
good to bathe in and to sail on and
we can move the tad-poles and their
parents out and take over ourselves.

drowned trying to swim from the
Cellar to the P. 0.? Were you—oh
horrible fate —almost blown down
the highway to Dinah's by the rag
ing gale that was tearing great hunks
off the trees?
If you caught a thorough-going
case of pneumonia or sinus which
is still making you talk like a fog
horn, don't feel that it was all in
vain. For every little drop of liquid
sunshine that trickled down your

neck making you long for a good,
cozy fire and a hot toddy, there was
a corresponding drop that fell into
the Lagunita Mud-Puddle, trans
forming it from a disgusting and
slushy mess into a thing of true
beauty.
Lake Rises
This eagle-eyed observer, who has
crow's-feet around her eyes from
gazing speculatively at great bodies
of water and gauging the breezes
thereon, states that we lack only
about three feet of muddy, yellow
water to have a full-fledged lake at
our back doors.
Hourly trips of observation have
been made during the past few days,
and on the last excursion—when the

final few drops of rain were drifting
down —there was actually a bridge
game in progress on the docks, and
one over-eager and definitely over
optimistic young female in a bath
ing suit who was trying to get a
tan.
Great Things Promised
I wasn't close enough to see her
but from a distance
it was a good picture as a promise
of great things to come—hot sun,
countless equally hot bridge games
going, portable radios blaring forth,
and that wonderful escape from the
drudgery of studying.
Those of us who are sun-worship
pers and escapists from toil (and who
isn't?) are girding ourselves for the

great battle which will come after
the ASSU office has proclaimed the
open season, and everyone this side
of the border rushes madly lake
ward, knocking down and trampling
under foot any infidel who dares get
in the way.
So if'The Rains come again, as the
weatherman seems to think they will,
don't feel that life is a snare, trap,
and delusion created by the Cali
fornia Chamber of Commerce. Glory
in the whipping, cold wind and mis
erable driving rain. Three more
beautiful feet of the stuff that is only
good to bathe in and to sail on and
we can move the tad-poles and their
parents out and take over ourselves.
Did you have trouble last week
getting your rowboat launched on
the great Lasuen River to scull to
your 8 o'clock? Or were you one of
the poor unfortunates who nearly
drowned trying to swim from the
Cellar to the P. 0.? Were you—oh
horrible fate —almost blown down
the highway to Dinah's by the rag
ing gale that was tearing great hunks
