# Dr. Lanz Speaks For 'Y' On Russian Policies
## 
### MARION MORROW 
In his discussion of "Russian Policy Toward Germany" for the "Y"
| World Affairs Group yesterday afternoon, Dr. Henry Lanz, professor of
; Slavic languages and philosophy, expressed the opinion that Russia was
i not fighting Germany, but Fascism.
He continued by commenting that Russia did not wish, as many people

! seem to think, to see Germany split«
! into small sections, since this would
render her of no economic assist
ance io .'Russia.
Not Spreading Communism
In answer to the many questions
I asked, Dr. Lanz was very specific
in his belief that the Russians were
not attempting to spread the gospel
of Communism throughout the world
—the United States in particular—
since they fully realized that Social
istic revolutions would render the
countries unable to give her the ma- ,
chinery, raw materials, and economic j
support she will need so desperately I
I following the war.
It is these things, and not money, i
j that they need and want, he added, j
Demands Little of Poland
In Poland, all Russia wants is a
government not hostile to the Rus
sian government, and because the
United Nations have left it up to
her to occupy these countries, she
is placed in a suspicious position, he
continued.
The eastern part of Poland has
been granted to be itmographically
belonging to Russia.
''The United States will have no
more right to impose their demo- j
cratic ideas upon the German people

after the war, than would the United
States grant that Russia had the
right to impose communistic ideas,"
he said. "Turn it around," he con
tinued, "and it may be seen that
the United Slates has not been faced
with the same conditions as has
Russia."
"As it is the powers do not have
an international democracy, but an
international oligarchy, with the
three big powers at the top," he con
cluded.
