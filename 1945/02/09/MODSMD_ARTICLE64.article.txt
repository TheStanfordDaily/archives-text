# On the Discs

### 
We're starting off this week with
the classical department and our first
selection is dedicated to "Misquote"
Weinberg. It is: Mozart's Symphony
No. 41 in C Major (Jupiter) by the
London Philharmonic under Sir
Thomas Beeeham. (Columbia).
Next on our list is Brahm's Piano
Concerto No. 2 by Vladimir Horowitz
with the orchestra under Arturo
Toscannini (Victor). Last of the
classical records is "Evening Star"
from Tannhauser and "Valentine's
Aria" from Faust sung by Lawrence
Tibbet (Victor).
Popular Favorites
In the popular department our
first selection is the now famous
"Rum and Coca-Cola" sung by the
Andrew's Sisters (Decca). Due to
the fact that Coca-Cola is mentioned
in the song, it has been banned from
the four major radio networks, as
they claim it will give free adver
tising to the Coca-Cola company and
the networks are afraid to let them
make money without paying for it.
The next record is for the Harry
James fans and goes by the title of
"I'm Beginning to See the Light"
and the vocal as done by Kitty Kal
len is very good. This particular song
was reviewed once before in this
column, but we feel that this is a
better record and therefore should
be mentioned.
For the jazz addicts we're featur
ing piano this week; "Companin'"
and "Ramblin' " by Jess Stacy (Com
modore); Brunswick's "Barrelhouse
Piano" album featuring such gx-eat
pianists as Mary Lou Williams,
James P. Johnson, Frank Melrose,
and Alex Hill. This is a very fine
album and should be a part of your
collection.
Boogic-Woogie Featured
Another fine piano album is also
put out by Brunswick and it is de
voted to boogie-woogie. For those
of you who like Jelly-Roll Morton
and for those of you who think you
don't, his "New Orleans Memories"
album (General) is an absolute must.
Last record of the week is not
strictly piano but features such ex
cellent work by the late Fats Waller,
that we feel it ought to be mentioned.
It's title is "Pretty Doll" and it's by
Eddie Condon (Commodore). You
won't find Fats' name on the record,
but you will find that somebody
named "Maurice" is playing piano.
Maurice of course is Fats.
If any of you readers of this col
umn have any suggestions or cri
ticisms, or if you would like to write
a guest column, we'd love to hear
from you.
