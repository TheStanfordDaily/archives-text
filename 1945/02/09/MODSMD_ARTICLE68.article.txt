"What's the game?" drawled

j "Seven card spit with a brass j

A small group of men were hua
' died in the corner of the mop room
warming their hands over a deck of
cards. It was late Saturday after
noon and the wind howled down the
drafty halls of Encina, while Louie
the Dorque nervously dealt the
pasteboards. The Dorque is a limber
fingered character from Montana
who can't seem to stay off these de
tails. Right at this moment, no one
seemed particularly concerned about
the detail. Only one person looked
out of place, Igor Beaver, who was
mopping the floor and reading a
copy of Field Manual 21-75 at the
same time. As George picked up his
cards, he groaned:
"Who dealt this mess—but just to
make a game I'll raise it ten."
Igor grinned broadly and winked
at Blackball. Blackball, a former
"man about Roble," smiled, "Eh,
Mac, what's wild?"
"Oh, dueces, one-eyed Jacks and
red cards," said the Dorque.
From back in a smoky corner, a
voice groaned, "Seventeen long, hard,
\yeeks of Basic Training and what do
I do?—mop floors!" The speaker
wore blue piping on his hat and was
obviously P.O.'d. He had been caught
wearing an ASTRP patch to impress
his girl. (When you boys deserve a
better patch you'll get it.)
The game grew more tense. The
situation wasn't helped when a pair
of aces slipped from the Dorque's i
sleeve and rattled noisily on the i
board. Blackball raised the bet an
other five pesos, which George called,
as he nonchalantly lit the cork tip
of a cigarette and dusted the ashes !
down hi< throat. The boy in blue j
piping shot him a quick glance.
"Gee, do you inhale?" he asked.
They spread out their cards, j
"Seven card royal" Blackball mut- !
tered as he reached for the pot.
But George's hand was quicker. I
I "Hold on, I've got seven aces," he j
t growled.
Ths left some confusion. The clink
; of coins grew so loud that none of
the boys noticed the man who j
stepped through the door, his should
ers slightly stooped under the heavy
Lieutenant's bars.
