(This is the first in a group of editorials to
review current problematical phases of our
student government which will be served in
small doses, but with large implications.)
NOMINATING COMMITTEE
Once the Executive Committee of the student
body government looked for a lull during the
war years, which seemed proper enough to
expect. But the lull came only in the superficial
hysteria of Stanford politics; and with the busy
superficiality torn away, some very blatant de
fects in student government seem too apparent
to remain with us.
One of these defects, the problem of getting
Stanford's most competent people into student
government, was considered in a report of the
methods of election at Excom last week.
The recommendations of this report were that
Nominating Committee should have its function
as a source for candidates reduced, and that as
many candidates as possible should get on the
ballots by having petitions of fifteen signatures
filed.
The permanent committee would be com
posed of representative groups of both men
and women, a definite improvement over the
present system which is overbalanced as a
women's function, overlarge, and without a
representative from Excorn. Committee mem
bers would merely advise interested students,
however, and would not select candidates by
interview.
The possible danger in the plan introduced
is in the method of filling out the ballot when
not enough students or only "mediocre" can
didates are running by petition. In this case
the proposal is to have nominating committee
fill out the list, not by interviews with inter
ested persons as they do now, but from lists
which they themselves have accumulated
through the quarter in their capacity to find
people by asking class and hall leaders about
prospective officers.
The real question is whether or not the best
candidates will run for office if petitioning is
the only sure means of getting on the ballot,
and whether or not the obscure method of being
placed on the nominating committee's list would
be mishandled.
Further investigation might reveal, however,
that the problem is even ' deeper than that.
Some of the most responsible and competent
leaders will probably always remain aloof from
elections as long as there is no clear-cut pic
ture in the student's mind about the authority
and the effectiveness of student government.
Actually there is a great freedom at Stanford
in the power of student government, however
frequently it is subverted by shortsighted poli
cies of secrecy and the natural tendency of a
small group, which feels quite unsupported, to
avoid controversial issues.
The problem remains that the machinery
ran be changed and rechanged, but until the
etiectiveness of the group is realized by each
student, there will- be difficulty in getting the
oest people to assume responsibility for stu
dent government.
