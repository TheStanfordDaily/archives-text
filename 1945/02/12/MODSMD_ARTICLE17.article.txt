As this is being written, all is silent. The rest of The
Daily staff decided to take the day off and go out on
a Walrus hunt.
But there is still the present so-called "Big 3" con
ference which is being handled in the usual manner of
diplomatic discussions, in a shroud of secrecy. As a
matter of fact, the most significant news about it is
coming out of the unheated but active French Chamber
of Deputies.
French Position
This is not amazing, since France might very well
be the key nation in the balance of power of postwar
Europe. Whether or not General DeGaulle is at the
conference, it is certain that his nation is being much
discussed.
France's position and France's hopes rest in certain
fundamental ideas, trends and fears at loose in the
world today.
On the one hand is Great Britain's policy. It has al
ways been for peace in Europe and for Europe balanced
against itself rather than united. There is good reason
for this, since England's main worry is keeping and
consolidating her Empire, the basis of her national
wealth. A united Europe might try to expand itself
at her expense, and a Europe at war means an England
at war, with subsequent drain on her population, credit,
and resources.
Russia
Then comes the knotty problem of Russia and what
she is out to get. Russia also needs a great deal of
security, since she is incapable of handling a European
aggressor unaided, as recent history has shown. Yet,
after she has consolidated the gains of the Communist
revolution, is capable of arming and training her masses
of manpower, what then?
We might find the answer in terms of expansion in
Asia, Pan-Slavism and European imperialism. Russian
pressure in the Far East has been a factor for a great
many centuries. Peter the Great planned for it, and
Disi'aeli was about ready to fight a war to prevent it.
Pan Slavism is a Russian idealogy. Many great Rus
sian thinkers have wanted to unite the Slavic people
of the world under the greatest of Slavic nations,
theirs. Such a unification is not impossible since many
Slavic peoples feel a kinship to Russia, although many
more, such as the Poles, do not.
Clash
All this might look perfectly well from the Russian
standpoint, but it is against traditional British foreign
policy. Thus Mr. Churchill must and probably is de
manding limits to Soviet power.
The English don't want a war with Russia, so they
are probably willing to give her buffer states and a
Slavic power bloc, if it stays out of Central Europe and
off of the Mediterranean coast.
Still, Germany has to be controlled by somebody
since the temper of the world is inflamed against her.
Mr. Churchill and Mr. Stalin each see a threat to his
security if the other runs that country, so the question
has been settled by the obvious diplomatic compromise
of turning the thankless task over to America.
France
This leaves France as the only other major power in
Europe that can decide the issue one way or another,
but the wisest French foreign policy is not to definitely
commit herself now.
She has signed an alliance with Russia, but she has
also declared that she will support Britain and America
in regard to certain questions in which they vary with
the Soviet. Thus she stands in the middle of the road.
She can keep the integrity of her empire by this ap
proach, since no one dares alienate her at this point,
and she might also get the Rhineland.
