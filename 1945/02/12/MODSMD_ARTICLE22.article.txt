# Indepenpents Beat Army All-Star Team, 42-34
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Grabbing an early and convincing
lead and taking advantage of fol
low shots, the Palo Alto Independents
coasted to a basketball 42 to 34
"triumph over a group of Army All -
Stars in the Palo Alto High gym
nasium Saturday night before a
small but congenial throng of on
lookers.
Dave Brown's squad, in a drab
'game from the spectator's standpoint,
was led by Morley Thompson, who
totalled 13 points in his "last half"

I style. Guard Ed Douglas and Center
j Jack Hcald each found the hoop for
i 12 counters. The Army, a group of
| local players, had to rely on Max
| Bauer's effort of 13, mostly on fast
j breaks, and Solomon's total of 10.
The Independents quickly got off
| to an 8 to 4 lead early in the game,
j and after Douglas had swished the
; net twice from the left corner and
■ Heald had connected on some pivot
) shots, were leading 18 to 7 at the
i rest period.
Bauer Takes Over
! Small but elusive, Bauer stepped
I into the limelight in the second
I stanza, bucketing consecutive fast
I breaks to considerably perk up the
| contest. The Army threatened to
j overcome the deficit- until Thomp
| son staged his traditional "scoring
| spell" to cash in on tip-ins and free
| throws.
Only the work of Solomon and
Bauer kept the All-Stars in the
game after Heald and Dick Mar
quette of the Independents brought
! the score to 39 to 27 with minutes
!to go. The khaki-clad boys once
! again made a last rally, but were
J stopped by the final gun which
j brought the score to 42 to 34.
Few Fouls Called
j Comparatively few fouls were
[ called against the teams by Referee
Jack Miller, only 12 personals being
caught all night. The Independents
| cashed in on four out of seven chari
j ty tosses, with the Army capitalizing
on five out of six.

Grabbing an early and convincing
lead and taking advantage of fol
low shots, the Palo Alto Independents
coasted to a basketball 42 to 34
"triumph over a group of Army All -
Stars in the Palo Alto High gym
nasium Saturday night before a
small but congenial throng of on
lookers.
Dave Brown's squad, in a drab
'game from the spectator's standpoint,
was led by Morley Thompson, who
totalled 13 points in his "last half"

I style. Guard Ed Douglas and Center
j Jack Hcald each found the hoop for
i 12 counters. The Army, a group of
| local players, had to rely on Max
| Bauer's effort of 13, mostly on fast
j breaks, and Solomon's total of 10.
The Independents quickly got off
| to an 8 to 4 lead early in the game,
j and after Douglas had swished the
; net twice from the left corner and
■ Heald had connected on some pivot
) shots, were leading 18 to 7 at the
i rest period.
Bauer Takes Over
! Small but elusive, Bauer stepped
I into the limelight in the second
I stanza, bucketing consecutive fast
I breaks to considerably perk up the
| contest. The Army threatened to
j overcome the deficit- until Thomp
| son staged his traditional "scoring
| spell" to cash in on tip-ins and free
| throws.
Only the work of Solomon and
Bauer kept the All-Stars in the
game after Heald and Dick Mar
quette of the Independents brought
! the score to 39 to 27 with minutes
!to go. The khaki-clad boys once
! again made a last rally, but were
J stopped by the final gun which
j brought the score to 42 to 34.
Few Fouls Called
j Comparatively few fouls were
[ called against the teams by Referee
Jack Miller, only 12 personals being
caught all night. The Independents
| cashed in on four out of seven chari
j ty tosses, with the Army capitalizing
on five out of six.
