# German Heads Edit Unique Manuscript
## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
A Middle High German translation
of the "Summa Theologica," by St.
Thomas Aquinas is now being edited
from a 14th century manuscript by
Professor Bayard Q. Morgan and
F. W. Strothmann of the Germanic
languages department. The Summa
is a treatise on the medieval concep
tion of theology.
Mr. Strothmann became interested
in the manuscript several years ago,
and on a trip to Germany he made
arrangements to have a microfilm
copy made and sent to Stanford. The
microfilm has been at Stanford since
about 1938, Dr. Morgan said. The
book the professors are using is a
photostatic copy from the microfilm.
The original manuscript is housed
at Stuttgart, Germany.
"The book is unique because, al
though there are many documents in
Middle High German, they were
mostly written in poetic form. This
is the only extended piece of prose
in Middle High German derived
from a Latin original," Dr. Morgan
said. It is assumed that a monk
translated the Latin into German
for instructional purposes.
The book will consist of a tran
scription of the manuscript original,
and critical comment of the manu
script and translation by the au
thors. In addition there will be a
double glossary, German-Latin and
Latin-German.
The finished product will have ap
proximately 600 pages, 63 of which
are done now, Dr. Morgan said. The
authors hope to have the book fin
ished this year.
