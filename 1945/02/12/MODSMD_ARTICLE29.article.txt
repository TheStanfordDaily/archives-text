''Gag? Contest? Oh, yes: fifteen
bucks ain't no gag, and I'll personally
see that no one on the Chappie staff
gets any of it." This was such a civil
answer for the Chaparral Business
office that your reporter almost
stepped inside the door. She was soon
reassured by the Business Manager's
unholy leer, and the interview con
tinued from a safe distance.
-."You see, it's this way. Stuff for
the editorial department's opium
pipes is getting mighty short these
days. Never touch the stuff myself, of
course. Ummm . . . Anyway, we
want to get some of the campus au

! thors out of the woodwork, people
i that can write funny stuff, maybe a
■ real hoomerous short story two
112 thousand, five thousand words or so,
I | see? The best one gets fifteen bucks
. (my broken toes are almost healed
t up, too), with four and one each for
i the next two."

the Chappie staff would do the judg
ing. with a new judge to he called
1 1 in if they couldn't agree. "Of course,

bert, fingering his 20-foot bull whip
' reflectively. "Just so none of the
wonderful entries get lost, you know,
~ the stairs outside here are darn dan-
I gerous without a guide, they ought

to be mailed. All they have to do is
scrawl 'Box .'>ol3, Stanford' on au
envelope, put in the story, put on a
stamp, and give the Post Office a
crack at it. Before midnight, March
11!"
Your reporter said that sounded
swell, in fact did he think she had a
chance with a real dirty story about
how she met her love at the Reg
dance. The last thing she heard as
; he started after her with foaming
! mouth was, "??*!'»s?** —NO! You
| know we print high-type, clean-cut
j elevating stuff, and why don't you
I come in and tell it to me anyway?
These stories gotta be literate and
clean and . . . and . . . Hey! Come
1 back hei'e!"

see that no one on the Chappie staff
gets any of it." This was such a civil

-."You see, it's this way. Stuff for
the editorial department's opium
pipes is getting mighty short these

stamp, and give the Post Office a
crack at it. Before midnight, March
11!"
Your reporter said that sounded
swell, in fact did he think she had a
chance with a real dirty story about
how she met her love at the Reg
dance. The last thing she heard as
; he started after her with foaming
! mouth was, "??*!'»s?** —NO! You
