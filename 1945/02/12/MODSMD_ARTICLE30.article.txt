TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT—Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
"To Have and Have Not" could
perhaps be described as the poor
man's version of "Casablanca." For

gone are the pa
latial splendors
of Rick's club,
and in it's place
the squalor and
degeneration of
Martinque.
Yet there are
still some hang
overs from
"C a s a b 1 a nca."
Humphrey Bo
gart is again the

worldly gentleman who, torn be
tween Vichy and Free France, de
cides upon a neutral course that will
bring himself the most good. And
there remains a broken-down piano
player, this time in the person of
Hoagy Carmichael, and the usual
amount of Warner Brothers gun
play.
Lauren ("Just whistle when you

want me") Bacall, a sultry, hungry
looking individual, is Bogart's femi
nine companion and lives up to her
press notices with an effective line
of bedroom patter. At times it seemed
that Miss Bacall's actions were just
a bit too obvious, but the Sunday
matinee audiences evidently wanted
just such happenings.
Walter Brennan, together with
most of the cast, is seen-as a drunken
bit of human driftwood who con
tinually wobbles in and out of the
picture.
"To Have and Have Not," if you
relish plenty of love-making, in
trigue, and elbow-bending, will
probably satisfy your entertainment
palate.
"The Falcon in Hollywood," sec
ond feature, is a standard whodunit
that finds the Falcon (Tom Conway)
roaming around the R-K-O lot in
search of some sort of killer. The
only enjoyable character in this
time-killer is a half-crazed director
who goes around spouting Shake
speare. —Dick Bower
