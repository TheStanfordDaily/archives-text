# Explanation of Electron Microscope Clarified
## 
### JANE McENTIRE 
Although he hesitates to call himself "inventor," Dr. Marton of th
Division of Electron Optics admits that many patents on the electron
microscope, described about a week ago in The Daily, are registered i

his name.
Because the female staff of The !
Daily isn't always up to par on its;
physics (I speak for myself), and :
because the electron microscope is
still at the stage in which few peo- j
pie understand it very well, Dr. i
Marton would like to clarify a few j
errors in the explanation.
In the first place, the statement
tha't the "limit of magnification of j
a light microscope is 2,000 diameters" j
should be changed to "the limit of !
useful magnification . . ." For as Dr. j
Marton pointed out, the photograph
of an object under a microscope can
be enlarged many times, and thus
be "magnified." It is only when
further detail ceases to show that
the limit of usefulness is reached.
Another idea that Dr. Marton
wanted to explain is the reason for j
the advantage of the electron micro
scope over the light microscopeâ€”
which can be roughly expressed this i
way. There are some particles of |
matter which are smaller than hall ;
the wave length of light so that light
rays do not form an image of them :
but tend to skip over the particles.
The wave length of electrons, how
ever, is so much shorter that it re
veals these infinitely small objects
that would otherwise remain un
seen.
Previous Occupations
Both Dr. Marton and his wife, who
works with him constantly in his
laboratory, were born in Hungary.
He left when he was still a child lor
Switzerland where he went to school; i
he received his Ph. D. in Zurich. |
From there he went to teach at the ;
University of Brussels where he
stayed for 11 years. It was in Brussels
in 1932 that he started his extensive
work on the electron microscope.
In 1938 the R.C.A. Victor Company
invited him to come to the United
States to continue his research work. |
For awhile Dr. Marton worked both
at the University of Pennsylvania I
and with the Victor Company, but j
later he left the university to devote i
his full time to his work with R.C.A. I
