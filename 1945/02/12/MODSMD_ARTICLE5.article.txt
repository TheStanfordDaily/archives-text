# Cellar Will Open Tonight For New 9-10:30 Service
## 
### 
The Stanford Cellar will open tonight from 9 to 10:30 p.m. and will be
open at this time every night Monday through Friday, according to Helen
Jones, Excom member in charge of the project.
For the first time since last spring quarter when the Cellar stopped
opening at night, students will have a chance to stop in for a big "choc

shake" on their way to and from
their evening sessions at the libe.
Black coffee will also be available
for those who wish to study for their
midterms in the seminar style.
Ten girls have agreed to hash for a
little while several nights during
the week, thus making it possible
for the Cellar to open. They are:
Pearl Montrond, Martha Locke,
Margaret Robertson. Maxine Arnold,
Gail Goodwin, Ursula Heard, Linda
Franceschi, Jacey Sweetman, Vir
ginia Palmer, and Emalee Sala.
Bill Brown of Toyon will run the
dish machine each night from 9:30
to 11:30 p.m. It was Brown who
answered the call for "just one more
man" in order that the Cellar might
be open evenings.
