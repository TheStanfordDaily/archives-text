Peacetime conscription will be the
subject of the Valentine's Debate
with Cal to be hold Wednesday in
j the Education Auditorium at 7:30.
"Since the peacetime draft ques
j tion has aroused so much local in
| terest in the previous debates held
at Stanford and Palo Alto, we have
1 arranged to hold the debate in the
: Education Auditorium to accom
modate a large audicnce," said Carol
Newton, debate manager.
An open forum in which mem
bers of the audience may question
, the debaters or present their own
views will be held after the formal
debate, according to Miss Newton.
Several squad members have had
experience debating the peacetime
conscription question this quarter in
; local debates and in mÂ«ets with Cal,
and the members of the team which
will participate in Wednesday's de
j bate will be named tonight at the
! regular squad meeting, according to
Professor J. Gordon Emerson, debut
| ing director.
"The question of peacetime con
i scription has provoked nation-wide
; discussion as a possible post-war
! project for the United States ever
since General Marshall came out in
favor of it late last year." said Miss
Newton.
The debate Wednesday night will
be a non-decision debate.
