cussed at Women's Conference yes
terday and will be decided upon
soon: (1) 2 a.m. late leaves, (2) new
war work policy, (II) and women's
bousing problem for next year,
fc A plan for having live 2 a.m. spe
" cial late leaves to be taken in place
of any Saturday night late leave or
1:30 floater during a quarter was
presented before yesterday's meet
ing of Women's Conference by the 2
a.m. late leave committee.
Lower and upper division women
would both have these special leaves.
Girls who are minus would be given
two 1:30 floaters and five special
leaves which could be taken in place
of the two floaters or Saturday night
leaves. Cultural leaves would be
done away with.
After a little more work on this
plan, the committee will present it
before Conference to be voted upon.
Alice Webb is chairman of the com
mittee and is replacing Joey Nell
Ryan who resigned as chairman at
conference.
War Work
Jeanette Grimsley, Stanford War
Board Co-ordinator, presented a plan
for doing awsy with the system ol
signing up for two hours of war work
a week. If the plan received favor
able comment at house meeting dis
cussions last night, it may be adopted
at the meeting of war board repre
sentatives today at 5 p.m.
The plan consists of having each
girl pledge two hours of work at the
beginning of each quarter. But there
would be no weekly signups for war
work. A list of jobs to be done would
be run in The Daily about twice a
week. When the job is done or when
enough people have signed up. the
job would be taken off the list.
Checking System
War Board Representatives from
each house would turn in a monthly
report of what their living group has
done to help the war effort. The rep
resentatives would check on the in
dividuals in their living group, and
the War Board would check on the
living groups. The chairman of each
type of war work would be respon
sible for seeing that her department's
job was done.
Members of Conference thought
that this type of system would make
it possible for girls to help the war

effort in ways which are not now
counted as war work. It would also
put war work on a voluntary basis.
The main disadvantage to this sys
tem would be, "Would war work
continue if signing up for two hours
a week were cut out?"
War Workshop
Miss Grimsley also announced that
