# ABSENTEE GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
The plan before Excom to change the method
of selecting and electing student officers springs
from the current reappraisal of student govern
ment which reveals much to be desired in its
effectiveness.
The weekly house meetings throughout cam
pus are the-mdividual students' only direct con
tact with government except for the week in
spring when he votes for a series of "names" of
"good heads" to become members of Excom.
The only real machinery of student govern
ment now is in the function of every house presi
dent who takes his house's opinions to the presi
dent of Women's Conference and Inter-hall
council and sees that, in their non-voting ca
pacity, they will take the matter to the student
officers on Excom.
No more need be said for this rickety ma
chinery than how many of us ever knew there
was a link between Excom and our house meet
ing? How many of us ever heard the actions
of Excom brought to us, or heard of actions
taken about our complaints in house meeting?
How real is our student government to us-
Why should we want to get into it- What good
can we see in being interested even if we do-
Our contention is that it is all a complicated
butch. And part of the reason is that the basic
model is outdated and inappropriate.
Student government at Stanford is based on
the plan of representation by the class. What
ever strength and unity the classes might have
had before the war has certainly become non
existent to Stanford now, and as long as the
system of representation continues on the class
basis, Excom officers will work in a fog, unable
to realize the valid problems of their groups
and what is worse, unable to see the effect of
their actions upon the students.
What is needed is a more direct channel for
the student to exercise pressure on his officers,
and a corresponding channel from the executive
committee to make student government answer
able to the student and to reality.
The present method based on the current
machinery could be improved by giving the
president of Inter-hall council and Women's
Conference a vote, but a thorough revision of
representation is needed to place the house
meeting in the picture of student government.
(Tomorrow's Daily will amplify such a plan.)

What is needed is a more direct channel for

and a corresponding channel from the executive

The present method based on the current

president of Inter-hall council and Women's
Conference a vote, but a thorough revision of
representation is needed to place the house
meeting in the picture of student government.
(Tomorrow's Daily will amplify such a plan.)
