MAN AtiAINST HIMSELF
Rockets, Flying Bombs, Radar, Supertanks, Jot Pro
pulsion Planes and Super Fortresses—these arc some of
h" remarkable new machines of war, examples of
nan's ingenuity in destroying himself. The variety, the
•ange, and the effectiveness —not to mention the ex
cuse —of these new weapons is awe inspiring.
But it makes one wonder whether or not science is
>niy really effective in producing death a I disaster.
Science turns its hand with such ease and such re
narkable success to the problems of warfare, one

wanders whether it can be as successful at anything
else.
Is there any possibility that we can develop another
science than that of murder? Do we have to leave the
creative and constructive side of man's character
neglected, or in the hands of warhearted but highly in
effectual liberals and sentimentalists?
New Directions
In the last 50 years a new branch of knowledge has
sprung up which has been trying to answer just such
questions. It is Psychiatry. It has been trying to solve
the problem of insanity in individuals, however, rather
than in nations. It tries to get rid of the irrational fears,
the hatreds and suspicions in sick minds; it tries to
remove the causes of delusions and hallucinations; it
tries to rebalance and stabilize emotions that have been
upset and distorted.
In the search for means to cure the mentally ill, in
the attempt to understand what insanity is, these in
vestigators have come to revise their whole conception
of man's nature.
They have found and learned how to make use of
his constructive and positive self, as well as his destruc
tive and negative self. They have learned that man is
not a mere piece of complex biological machinery,
following patterns determined by instincts, "condi
tioned reflexes," traditions, and social pressures.
They have learned that what most people thought was
our nature was only the surface of ourselves. Actually
there lie within us the most astounding and amazing
of forces—controlled and held in check in most of us,
but f which may overwhelm and destroy us during
mental illness.
IVlan for Himself
It is the hope and the faith of some of the modern
Psychiatrists that we can, by learning about ourselves
and our minds, live without hatred and fear and de
struction in our international lives as well as in our
personal lives.
They hope that we can utilize our energy and intel
ligence to discover as much about the methods of
understanding and directing man's nature as we have
in the past learned about the physical forces of the
external world. They think it possible and effective to
use our knowledge of how to deal with the individual
and his problems, in solving the problems of groups of
people or nations.
They believe that there is a science of peace, and a
remedy for wars and the causes of wars—a science
in which man is for himself, not against himself.

than in nations. It tries to get rid of the irrational fears,
the hatreds and suspicions in sick minds; it tries to
remove the causes of delusions and hallucinations; it
tries to rebalance and stabilize emotions that have been
upset and distorted.
In the search for means to cure the mentally ill, in
the attempt to understand what insanity is, these in
vestigators have come to revise their whole conception
of man's nature.
They have found and learned how to make use of
his constructive and positive self, as well as his destruc
tive and negative self. They have learned that man is
not a mere piece of complex biological machinery,
following patterns determined by instincts, "condi
tioned reflexes," traditions, and social pressures.
They have learned that what most people thought was
our nature was only the surface of ourselves. Actually
there lie within us the most astounding and amazing
of forces—controlled and held in check in most of us,
but f which may overwhelm and destroy us during
mental illness.
IVlan for Himself
It is the hope and the faith of some of the modern
Psychiatrists that we can, by learning about ourselves
and our minds, live without hatred and fear and de
struction in our international lives as well as in our
personal lives.
They hope that we can utilize our energy and intel
ligence to discover as much about the methods of
understanding and directing man's nature as we have
in the past learned about the physical forces of the
external world. They think it possible and effective to
use our knowledge of how to deal with the individual
and his problems, in solving the problems of groups of
people or nations.
They believe that there is a science of peace, and a
remedy for wars and the causes of wars—a science
in which man is for himself, not against himself.

MAN AtiAINST HIMSELF
Rockets, Flying Bombs, Radar, Supertanks, Jot Pro
pulsion Planes and Super Fortresses—these arc some of
h" remarkable new machines of war, examples of
nan's ingenuity in destroying himself. The variety, the
•ange, and the effectiveness —not to mention the ex
cuse —of these new weapons is awe inspiring.
But it makes one wonder whether or not science is
>niy really effective in producing death a I disaster.
Science turns its hand with such ease and such re
narkable success to the problems of warfare, one

wanders whether it can be as successful at anything
else.
Is there any possibility that we can develop another
science than that of murder? Do we have to leave the
creative and constructive side of man's character
neglected, or in the hands of warhearted but highly in
effectual liberals and sentimentalists?
New Directions
In the last 50 years a new branch of knowledge has
sprung up which has been trying to answer just such
questions. It is Psychiatry. It has been trying to solve
the problem of insanity in individuals, however, rather
than in nations. It tries to get rid of the irrational fears,
the hatreds and suspicions in sick minds; it tries to
remove the causes of delusions and hallucinations; it
tries to rebalance and stabilize emotions that have been
upset and distorted.
