BIG 3 DECISIONS
The "Big 3" is at last forthcoming with a program,
which is based on the following points:
1. Three-power control of Germany, and possibly
four.
2. Russia is to annex all Polish territory east of
the old Cur/on line.
Poland is to be compensated with German terri
tory to the Oder. East Prussia, and Silesia.
*1. Liberated countries are going to have the right
to choose their own government under a democratic
system.
The analysis of these four points is rather obvious.
Germany is going to be the void, (he abyss between the
Russian and Anglo-French sphere of influence. Her
control is going to be inter-allied, and probably master
minded by America. She will hold the possible balance
of power, but she will be neutralized.
There seems to be some question as to what the
French will get out of all this. With France the only
shield between Russia and her, England undoubtedly
will want France a major power. Thus Stalin's inten
tions, whether towards a division of Europe or a
personal conquest of the continent, will be shown on
whether he tries to surpress or dominate this nation,
or 4ets it expand.
As for the proviso about liberated countries, it seems
that Russia is being politely edged out of the Balkans.
The Communist parties there have always been minor
ity factions, because the wealth of the countries lies
in the hands of small, independent landowners. There
is no industrial proletariat to speak of.
Now the Communists have prestige, since they are
the organized and schooled leaders of revolutions, and
thus the logical people to take command of the re
sistance movements to the Nazi invasion. Still, in an
honest election, they would probably be beaten.
The Polish arrangement was probably worked out
as compensation. The Lublin government is practically
speaking Moscow, and probably, for that reason, has as
little respect in Poland proper as the old London gov
ernment. Poland might be compensated at (he expense
of Germany to save face for the Lublin government,
and to help prevent German aggression by taking its
bases away.
But there is that knotty problem of inter-allied con
trol of Germany. If history and common sense are worth
anything, this control is none at all, and thus the Ger
mans should assume some of their old stature in the
family of nations again. Thus there will be a great
fight over control of Germany by one power, and who
gets it might well determine the question of peace or
war in Europe. Thr Russian interests, represented by
the German leftist parties, and the British, by the
rightist, might indeed soon fight a political battle in
the streets of German cities.
Finally, there is still France, and the question of how
she will eventually fall, towards Britain or towards
Russia.
