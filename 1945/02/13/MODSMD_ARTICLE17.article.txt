# Betas-Phi Psis Tangle Tonight in Feature Tilt
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
The outcome of the Beta-Phi Psi

tilt tonight will probably decide the
Lagunita League championship. Both
teams are undefeated and have won
their games by wide margins.
The Phi Psi quintet is probably
the fastest in either league, depend
ing nn fast breaks and tip-ins for
their points. Tom Hood. Luke Pitts,
and Tom Ashley are the speedsters
for the squad, each averaging from
10 to 12 points per game. "Lefty" j
Luke is the boy to watch tomorrow
night, for he is consistently breaking
away for sensational set-ups and
giving the crowd a real show. Dick
Marquette and Bolt Nesbit are good,
rugged defense artists that will give
the Betas plenty of headaches.
Although slow in getting started, j
the Phi Psi's are always threatening
to break loose, as shown by their
41-27 triumph over the Sequoia ;
Roughs, and the 38-13 crushing of
Arguello Cards.
The Beta aggregation offers a great
and bitter challenge to the ability of
their rivals. Height will be one of
their great advantages, with Morley ;
Thompson, George Bower, and Hie
Supple all topping six feet. Thomp
son is always good for several coun
ters against any opponent. A former
all-city forward. Thompson started
his career with Lincoln High in San

i
Francisco and lias demonstrated his
ability in his stellar play for the
Palo Alto Independents. John Han
lon, Joe Slier. Doug Tuck and Mc-
Guire complete the talented Beta
roster.
In their previous games the "Reds" \
were in impressive 39-20 and 33-l(>
wins over Sequoia and Med. I. The j
Betas have a high average on their !
long shots and have a habit of mak- i
ing them look easy.
The final results of the tussle are j
about as easy to predict as what
happens when an irrestiblc object
meets an immovable one. VVe suggest
that you flip a quarter; at least you i
have a fifty-fifty chance of being
right. If you want to see a good game
of basketball, stow your books and I
come down to the gym and see what
two fraternities will do for a keg of
BEER.
Other battles of the evening in
clude: Med. I vs. Royal Flush in the
gym at 7:15, and Cougars vs. Sequoia,
Arguello Cards vs. Buchanan Bear
cats in the Pavilion.

The outcome of the Beta-Phi Psi

tilt tonight will probably decide the
Lagunita League championship. Both
teams are undefeated and have won
their games by wide margins.
The Phi Psi quintet is probably
the fastest in either league, depend
ing nn fast breaks and tip-ins for
their points. Tom Hood. Luke Pitts,
and Tom Ashley are the speedsters
for the squad, each averaging from
10 to 12 points per game. "Lefty" j
Luke is the boy to watch tomorrow
night, for he is consistently breaking
away for sensational set-ups and
giving the crowd a real show. Dick
Marquette and Bolt Nesbit are good,
rugged defense artists that will give
the Betas plenty of headaches.
Although slow in getting started, j
the Phi Psi's are always threatening
to break loose, as shown by their
41-27 triumph over the Sequoia ;
Roughs, and the 38-13 crushing of
Arguello Cards.
The Beta aggregation offers a great
and bitter challenge to the ability of
their rivals. Height will be one of
their great advantages, with Morley ;
Thompson, George Bower, and Hie
Supple all topping six feet. Thomp
son is always good for several coun
ters against any opponent. A former
all-city forward. Thompson started
his career with Lincoln High in San

i
Francisco and lias demonstrated his
ability in his stellar play for the
Palo Alto Independents. John Han
lon, Joe Slier. Doug Tuck and Mc-
Guire complete the talented Beta
roster.
In their previous games the "Reds" \
were in impressive 39-20 and 33-l(>
wins over Sequoia and Med. I. The j
Betas have a high average on their !
long shots and have a habit of mak- i
ing them look easy.
The final results of the tussle are j
about as easy to predict as what
happens when an irrestiblc object
meets an immovable one. VVe suggest
that you flip a quarter; at least you i
have a fifty-fifty chance of being
right. If you want to see a good game
of basketball, stow your books and I
come down to the gym and see what
two fraternities will do for a keg of
BEER.
Other battles of the evening in
clude: Med. I vs. Royal Flush in the
gym at 7:15, and Cougars vs. Sequoia,
Arguello Cards vs. Buchanan Bear
