. . What are the opportunities going
to be in postwar government work?
Men's Vocational Committee,
under the leadership of law-student
Jordan Peckham, has invited Chester
Baggs, prominent member of the
United States Civil Service Com
mission to answer this question to
morrow night in Toyon lqbby at
7:15.
While Baggs stressed that all
opinions to be given are unofficial,
they are nevertheless, he said, the
views held by most of the members
of the Civil Service Commission.
Chairman Jordan Peckham and
Master of Ceremonies Vernon Walk
er both stated that they believed
those students interested in postwar
government work will find the talk
instructive, and urged all campus
men to attend.
The speaker for the evening is a
graduate of UCLA, where he re
ceived his A.B. in Psychology in
1939. He served as a teaching assist
ant there for a while, but then joined
the Civil Service Commission. He
was with that body until 1940, when
he was drafted, but he returned a
year ago and is now deputy to the
head of the 9th Civil Service Region.
Vocom members remarked that
this would be the beginning of a
new series of meetings which they
hoped would erase last quarter's
failures. Vocom must become an
energetic student clearing house
serving the male student body with
vocational guidance information
through the medium of pamphlets,
meetings, and dynamic and well
qualified speakers, they added.
Refreshments will be served and
the meetyig will end promptly at
