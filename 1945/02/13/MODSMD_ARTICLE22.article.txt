# Pow-Wow Has Designs On All Indian Tribes
## 
### 
Not just a few students or a few !
j faculty members, but the entire i
j campus, from the frailest frosh to the j
i mightiest senior, and faculty mem- j
; bers without exception, are inviled 1
; to participate in the Stanford talent
show March 2 in Memorial Audi-
I torium. Especially designed for all
! Indian tribes on campus to whoop
i it up in true Stanford style, the
| Pow-Wow will be a competitive
) show featuring songs, dances, skits,
; and an unnamed category of novelty
j acts.
One of many groups planning its
Pow-Wow performance, Lagunita's
Casa Naranja has announced to ;
Chairman Peggy B'itts its intention I
! to present a take-off on "The High- j
wayman," under the direction of
1 Lydie Williams. Casa *Eucalypto is
i planning an original song, illustrated
! in drama.
Stressing the fact that only four
j days remain before the entry dead- j
line. Miss Fitts repeated that "ymi ;
' only have to tell the general drift" I
j of your skit, song, or novelty act in j
I order to be counted as an entrant.
Chairmen of each group will receive
j points toward membership in Ram's
| Head, honorary dramatic society
sponsoring the Pow-Wow.
Idea for the Pow-Wow came from
i Cardinals, who turned it over to I
Ram's Head as a possible traditional
; winter quarter function. Ram's Head :
in turn formulated rules for the I
| show, which are as follows:
1. All entries must be in February j
| 16. Miss Fitts will review each idea,
however vague, in order to balance

the program and prevent duplica
tion of acts.
2. Skits will be limited to eight
minutes.
3. Props used by each group must
be limited to those carried on and
off-stage with the players.
4. Costumes are unnecessary.
5. Skits will be judged by a board
of Ram's Head and Cardinal's mem
bers, and prizes will be awarded by
Ram's Head for the best-done, fun
niest, and most original acts.
If any group wishes to rehearse in
the Auditorium before the March 2
show, it should get in touch with
Mary Lou Patton at Jessie Jordan
House.
