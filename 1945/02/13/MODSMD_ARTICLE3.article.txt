"We are expecting a large audience to hear this debate since the ques
tion has already aroused a lot of interest both on campus and in Palo Alto,"

said Carol Newton, debate manager.
Tlie Stanford team will debate the
' affirmative of the question, "Re
solved, that a system of compulsory
military training of one years dura-*
tion should be adopted as a perma
nent peacetime policy in the United
i States."
Open Forum Follows
The debate will be followed by an
open forum in which members of
j the audience will be invited to par
ticipate. It is customary in meetings
of this type for members of the audi
' ence favoring the affirmative of the
question to sit on the right side of
the auditorium and those favoring
the negative to sit on the left.
