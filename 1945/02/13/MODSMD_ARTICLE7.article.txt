# Big Three Seal German Fate
## 
### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.—The Big Three today decreed death
for both German Nazism and militarism in a far reaching agree
ment to strip defeated Germany so completely of war making
capacity that she "will never again be able to disturb the peace
of the world."
The agreement was announced by President Roosevelt, Pre
mier Joseph Stalin and Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the
conclusion of a momentous eight-day conference at far away
Yalta in the Russian Crimea.
Their agreement covered most of the outstanding problems
and included decisions to: (1) Turn loose upon Germany a tre
mendous assault that will result in shortening the war.
2. Speed the establishment of world peace machinery by
holding a full dress United Nations meeting at San Francisco be
ginning April 25.
3. Form a new Polish government and tentatively fix Poland's
new eastern boundaries at the Curzon line. Poland would be
compensated for lost territory in the east with territory from
Germany.
4. Back the Atlantic Charter's principals of self-determination
among the liberated peoples of Europe in establishing their gov
ernments.
5. Invite France to join in the occupation of defeated Germany
and to take part in future European councils.
6. Bring China and Russia into simultaneous discussions on
establishment of a world peace organization—a possible hint
that Russia may eventually abandon her neutral status with
Japan.
They called upon the German people to "guit their hopeless
resistance" and assured them that the Allies do not propose to
destroy them.
