# War Hours Revised, Work Made Voluntary
## 
### 
War Board abolished the system of weekly
sign-ups for two hours of war work at a special
Auxiliary meeting yesterday afternoon. The
motion was passed, however, with the provision
that War Board representatives and living group
presidents assume cooperatively the responsi
bility for motivating interest and continued
participation in War Board activities.
Unofficial, individual group sign-up sheets,
monthly reports of group activities by the rep
resentative to the War Board, and a system of
checking on war work accomplished through
those in charge of the activities were suggested
methods of creating the necessary stimulus. In

addition The Daily will run twice a week a list
of war work to be done.
This system, by encouraging a voluntary
basis for student war work, is hoped to eliminate
the unwieldy system of counting and classify
ing war work, and will make it possible for
women to help the war effort in ways which
could not be tabulated under the previous
system.
The only consideration which had still held
the War Board to the past system had been—-
"Would war work continue if signing up for
two hours a week were cut out?" But the con
sensus of opinion among all the living groups
was that participation would not be adversely
affected.
