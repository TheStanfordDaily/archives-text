shall Small will represent Stanford

chosen from the Debating Society
members who have been studying
the pros and cons of peacetime con
scription at final tryouts held at the
regular squad meeting Monday night.
The Stanford team will uphold the
affirmative of the question, "Re

solved, that a system of compulsory
military service of one year's dura
tion for men between the ages of
17-21 should be adopted in the
United States after the war."
The twin to tonight's Home de
bate will be held at Cal Thursday,

questions of the debaters or con
tribute their own ideas on the sub

The question of compulsory mili
tary service as a permanent policy
has been the subject for debates in
the United States from as far back
as the first Continental Congress
when George Washington advocated
such a plan. The recent statement
that General Marshall favored a plan
of peacetime conscription has
brought the question to the attention
of the nation again.

Delta Sigma Rho all-campus debate
tournament, according to Miss New
ton, who urged that entries be in
before the deadline Saturday noon.
Teams may enter either as indi

run on the order of the intra-mural
ladders for sports events.
The question, "Resolved that the
study of the history of western civili
zation, scientifically considered, ne
gates religious belief." was chosen
by Debate Council from questions
submitted by students.
This question is easy to debate and
requires little preparation because
almost everyone already feels
strongly one way or the other about
the subject," said Miss Newton,
emphasizing that no previous debat
ing experience is necessary to enter
the contest.
The winning team will be awarded
a plaque at the Awards Banquet on
March 9, and runners-up will be

Debaters Gordon Levy and Mar
shall Small will represent Stanford
in the Valentine's Debate with Cal
on the Peacetime Conscription ques
tion tonight at 7 p.m. in the Educa
tion Auditorium.
Mr. Levy and Mr. Small were
chosen from the Debating Society
members who have been studying
the pros and cons of peacetime con
scription at final tryouts held at the
regular squad meeting Monday night.
The Stanford team will uphold the
affirmative of the question, "Re

solved, that a system of compulsory
military service of one year's dura
tion for men between the ages of
17-21 should be adopted in the
United States after the war."
The twin to tonight's Home de
bate will be held at Cal Thursday,
February 15, when Dorothy Willner
and Richard Jennings will go to
Berkeley to debate the negative of
the question for Stanford.
Tonight's debate will be followed
by an open forum in which the audi
ence will be invited to participate.
Members of the audience may ask

questions of the debaters or con
tribute their own ideas on the sub
ject to the general discussion, ac
cording to Carol Newton, debate
manager.
The question of compulsory mili
tary service as a permanent policy
has been the subject for debates in
the United States from as far back
as the first Continental Congress
when George Washington advocated
such a plan. The recent statement
that General Marshall favored a plan
of peacetime conscription has
brought the question to the attention
of the nation again.
All-Campus Tournament
Entries are being accepted for the
Delta Sigma Rho all-campus debate
tournament, according to Miss New
ton, who urged that entries be in
before the deadline Saturday noon.
Teams may enter either as indi

The question, "Resolved that the
study of the history of western civili
zation, scientifically considered, ne
gates religious belief." was chosen

the subject," said Miss Newton,
emphasizing that no previous debat
ing experience is necessary to enter
the contest.
