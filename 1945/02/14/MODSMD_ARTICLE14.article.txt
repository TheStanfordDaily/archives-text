REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT
Current study of the student government ma
rhinery reveals serious defects in the method of
communication between the student officers and
the student body as a whole.
The only existing method of contact for the
individual student is indirectly through Men's
[nter-hall Council and Women's Conference. The
presidents of these two bodies, must take the
complaints and opinions of students to Excom,
but first, legitimate arguments must be culled
from a weekly conference with about 30 house
oresidents. Even if the house officers convey
their message, they have no actual vote to de
cide these issues on Excom.
It is also through this very strained contact
that the actions of Excom and the reasons for
'hem must be brought back to the student.
For some time this machinery has not worked.
Since the basic pattern of representation on
Excom is the class, and the most effective ma
chinery of government is not the class, but the
living group, it is no wonder that student gov
ernment remains dangerously and ineffectively
iloof.
The best all-around plan currently in the air
o place the government of the student body in
ntal and immediate contact with the student
seems to be to recognize the divisions ot living
groups somewhat like the districts of the state
oolitical organizations and to have members of
Excom elected from among the presidents of
living groups.
For instance, the six house presidents of the
Lagunita unit elected by the members of their
house, would elect one of themselves to rep
resent all of their houses on Excom. The Union
'Jriit would do this as a unit. The Men's halls
vould be another unit. The women's houses
on the Row are another unit. Freshman women's
halls comprise a unit, and freshman men's halls
comprise a unit.
Under this arrangement your representative
on Excom would be as close to you as the presi
dent of Lagunita, or the president of defunct
pan-hell, and freshmen and off-campus students
could have an individual representative.
When your house president elected a mem
ber to Excom, he would then have a direct re
sponsibility to account to you for his actions.
When you asked action on a measure, your
house president would go directly to your unit
president at their meeting and you would have
more direct contact with the chief student of
ficers.
Conference and Inter-hall council would meet
as they do now and have the jurisdiction that
they should over social regulations and living
group regulations, but approximately one of
jvery five would have a seat on Excom and an
ddequate knowledge of the related problems.
The plan in action would provide for 11 vot
ng members of Excom, one each from La
gunita, the Row, the Men's halls, the Frosh
Vlen's halls, the Frosh Women's halls, the
Army, off-campus students, a grad represent
itive, and a president and vice-president who
u ne would be elected in the general elections
n spring.
This plan seeks a more direct line between

student government and the student, hoping to
make student government a more vital force at
Stanford, to make it effective and direct, thereby
encouraging the most competent people to seek
office and consider student questions.
Bring your amplifications, modifications, re
buttals or doubts to Excom tonight where the
topic is under consideration.
