LABOR DRAFT
For weeks I have been waiting to hear an open stand
taken against the most atrocious legislative bill that
has ever been attempted to be pawned off on the
American people: the Labor Draft; as yet I have heard
nothing, only whisperings in the nightly bull sessions.
It seems that Stanford, like the rest of the American
people, has become meek and docile, and follows its
leaders blindly, not knowing whence they go, or what
they shall accomplish. I have, therefore, taken it upon
myself to explain the essence of the Labor Draft.
For those of you who do not know what the present
May-Bailey Labor Draft bill entails, I will give a brief
summary. It is a bill to draft for labor on the home
front all men between the ages of 18-45, and to put
them where they are most needed, no matter what the
pay scale may be. If the work orders are not complied
with, the men are subject to military duty or jail.
Slave Labor?
At present the main on-the-scene exponents of this
bill are the American bureaucrats, who claim that if
men can be drafted to fight and die for their country,
the rapidly falling morale of the American soldiers
wages" on the home front. They claim that this will not
only solve the labor problem, but also will build up
they can certainly be drafted to work for "exorbitant
abroad, who hear of the home front being run on the
race tracks and baseball diamonds.
Yes, the morale effect would be terrific. While our
allied leaders stand on their white pedestals shouting
to the world at large that our boys are dying on our
far-flung war fronts for ''free labor vs. slave labor,"
they are at the same time doing their best to pass a
bill whereby we will offer our men abroad the fighting
theme of "slave labor vs. slave labor." Yes, it will have
a terrific morale effect, but it will be the wrong kind.
Crisis for America
In reality the labor draft can correctly be appraised
as an attempt to consolidate totalitarian power in the
U. S. and to cover up muddling incompetance. This is
the crisis in American democracy, comparable to the
situation which faced the German people shortly after
the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor. From our
Olympian heights we upbraided the German people
for not resisting in time to prevent the Hitler con
solidation of power. Will we prove more intelligent or
virtuous? Will we reject this consolidation of totali
tarianism while there is yet time, or will we, too, go
the way of Germany—into Fascism?
Both groups which struggle for totalitarian power
in the U. S. are agreed on one thing: the destruction
of the free labor movement; that is an absolute pre
condition to totalitarianism. Both are substantially
agreed on the nature of the State. The coming struggle,
already begun, is for the control of the State. On one
side will be the industrialists and on the other, the
bureaucrats, fundamental believers in national social
ism, each seeking to woo the military.
Danger From Bureaucrats
Most of these bureaucrats would reject the term
"national Socialism," but they believe in a national
economy operated by a political bureaucracy. Many
do not understand that this is the basis of all totali
tarianism and the things which have followed have
merely resulted from the dynamics of that concept.
America would be no different. The end would be an
uprooted population, dependent for existence on the
State and incapable of fighting back. "Certainly," Huey
Long once said, ''America will get Fascism, but it will
get it as anti-Fascism."

At present the main on-the-scene exponents of this
bill are the American bureaucrats, who claim that if
men can be drafted to fight and die for their country,
the rapidly falling morale of the American soldiers
wages" on the home front. They claim that this will not
only solve the labor problem, but also will build up
they can certainly be drafted to work for "exorbitant
abroad, who hear of the home front being run on the
race tracks and baseball diamonds.
Yes, the morale effect would be terrific. While our
allied leaders stand on their white pedestals shouting
to the world at large that our boys are dying on our
far-flung war fronts for ''free labor vs. slave labor,"
they are at the same time doing their best to pass a
bill whereby we will offer our men abroad the fighting
theme of "slave labor vs. slave labor." Yes, it will have
a terrific morale effect, but it will be the wrong kind.
Crisis for America
In reality the labor draft can correctly be appraised
as an attempt to consolidate totalitarian power in the
U. S. and to cover up muddling incompetance. This is
the crisis in American democracy, comparable to the
situation which faced the German people shortly after
the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor. From our
Olympian heights we upbraided the German people
for not resisting in time to prevent the Hitler con
solidation of power. Will we prove more intelligent or
virtuous? Will we reject this consolidation of totali
tarianism while there is yet time, or will we, too, go
the way of Germany—into Fascism?
Both groups which struggle for totalitarian power
in the U. S. are agreed on one thing: the destruction
of the free labor movement; that is an absolute pre
condition to totalitarianism. Both are substantially
agreed on the nature of the State. The coming struggle,
already begun, is for the control of the State. On one
side will be the industrialists and on the other, the
bureaucrats, fundamental believers in national social
ism, each seeking to woo the military.
Danger From Bureaucrats
Most of these bureaucrats would reject the term
"national Socialism," but they believe in a national
economy operated by a political bureaucracy. Many
do not understand that this is the basis of all totali
tarianism and the things which have followed have
merely resulted from the dynamics of that concept.
America would be no different. The end would be an
uprooted population, dependent for existence on the
State and incapable of fighting back. "Certainly," Huey
Long once said, ''America will get Fascism, but it will
get it as anti-Fascism."

LABOR DRAFT
For weeks I have been waiting to hear an open stand
taken against the most atrocious legislative bill that
has ever been attempted to be pawned off on the
American people: the Labor Draft; as yet I have heard
nothing, only whisperings in the nightly bull sessions.
It seems that Stanford, like the rest of the American
people, has become meek and docile, and follows its
leaders blindly, not knowing whence they go, or what
they shall accomplish. I have, therefore, taken it upon
myself to explain the essence of the Labor Draft.
For those of you who do not know what the present
May-Bailey Labor Draft bill entails, I will give a brief
summary. It is a bill to draft for labor on the home
front all men between the ages of 18-45, and to put
them where they are most needed, no matter what the
pay scale may be. If the work orders are not complied
with, the men are subject to military duty or jail.
Slave Labor?
At present the main on-the-scene exponents of this
bill are the American bureaucrats, who claim that if
men can be drafted to fight and die for their country,
the rapidly falling morale of the American soldiers
