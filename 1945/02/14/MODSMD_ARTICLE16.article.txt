XXX X X X
In your oh-so very sly way
You talk about the highway:
But how can you be a sinner,
When I wonder if you've been there?
You're a Thunder Rider pledge
Left hanging on the ledge;
Stop thinking of yourself—
And save me from the shelf.
You are not quite a D-D Daddy
But certainly a Doing-Wrong Laddy
When, subtle as a firing squad.
You pedal through the Inner Quad.
You've got the hots for L. Bacall
When 1 whistle you don't fall;
But to you alone I fain would give
My lecture notes on Western Civ.
Though you're only seventeen
Won't vou be mv Valentine?
