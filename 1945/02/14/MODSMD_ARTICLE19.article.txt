# Betas Upset By Phi Psi's!
## 
### 
The widely heralded "battle of
the century" between the Betas and
the Phi Psi's in the Roble Mural
Basketball League last night turned
out to be all that was anticipated
and more, as 200 screaming cage
fans saw the Phi Psi's score eight
points in the last few minutes to
edge by, 29-28.
Contrary to predictions, the first
fchalf was an exhibition of clean, pre
cision basketball which saw both
teams employing a tight zone defense
which proved an effective check on
the fast-breaking type of play char
acterizing mural basketball.
The Betas drew first blood, with
goals by Thompson and Sher in the
early minutes. About midway in the
first period the Phi Psi's broke loose
for four tallies, paced by Luke Pitts,
to take an 8-4 lead for the initial
quarter. The second period saw the
Bfeta defense tighten as the eventual
victors were held to two goals while
the Betas themselves tallied nine to
take a commanding 17 to 12 lead at
the half.
The Beta defense continued to hold
during the third quarter and the
Phi Psi's peppered ineffectually at
the basket while the losers increased
their lead, led by Ric Supple, who
tanked six points from the left
pocket. Then, with about 5 minutes
to go in the game, the victors found
their eye, and charged down the
court for eight successive points,
with Tom Hood's final effort from
about 10 feet out giving the Phi Psi's
the contest by one point. Tom Ash
ley lead the final drive with six
points. Morley Thompson was the
hero for the losers, tanking several
from far out on the court to take
high point honors with 11.
