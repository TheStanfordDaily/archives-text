# Newcomer Tells Of Tax Planning

### 
"The complete solution to full em
ployment does not lie in the tax sys
tem; instead the solution of the tax
problem lies in full employment." In
the closing words of her address,
Miss Mabel Newcomer, Stanford '13,
and professor of economics at Vassar
Col lege, the keynote of her talk
for the Tuesday Evening Series last
night.
Speaking on "Tax Plans for Post
war Prosperity," Miss Newcomer
outlined four tax plans now under
consideration for the years following
the war. These plans are: (1) The
Twin Cities Plan; (2) The C.E.D.
(economic development) plan; (3)
The Ruml-Solon Plan; and (4) The
Hanson-Furlough Plan. All these
plans are designed to cut taxes, and
develop business by various means,
"but," said Miss Newcomer, "the ex
pected tax yields from these plans
are all inadequate. They are all over
optimistic of business cycle control.
Such control demands quick action
and Congress is a s1 o w-moving
body."
"There is also," she added, "a great
risk in reducing taxes too soon," be
cause such a step would bring a bad
inflation. "The tax system as it is,
offers more opportunity for recon
version than any plan yet devised;
but everything depends on main
taining full employment and a high
level of production following the
war."
