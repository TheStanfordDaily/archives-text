"Willi the exception of last year,
every Spring Show has come from
the student body, and we want it
ft that way this spring," said Corky ,
Wollman, president of the Ram's
Head which is sponsoring the play- |
writing contest ending March 16.
The contest gives every Li"l Injun
who has busy ideas buzzin' in his
head a chance to write 'em down I
on paper and then see 'em produced
by the leading actors of the campus j
on the Memorial Auditorium stage j
next spring.
Three Acts Preferred
There are no restrictions on plots
iind they may be one, two, or three j
acts, although the latter is preferred. (
All manuscripts should be type
written and may be turned in to
Miss Wollman at Manzanita Hall, J
510 Lasuen, or to the dramatic man
ager's office in room 2 of the Old j
Union.
In former years, this contest lasted
during the first few weeks of winter
quarter and the three winning one
act plays were presented late in
February; but as no Spring Show
will be presented thus year, the con- I
test will run through nil of winter
quarter and the prize-winning plays
will be presented some time in May.
