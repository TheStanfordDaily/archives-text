### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
Stanford debaters Gordon Levy
and Marshall Small defended uni
! versal compulsory peacetime con
| scription against the University of
California team at the first of the
j traditional Stanford-Cal debates
| yesterday evening.
"It is a question of having a large
i army, or no army at all," >vas the
j statement of first speaker Gordon
Levy, as he defended the affirmative
position of the question, "Resolved,
that the United States adopt a per
manent policy of one year's com
pulsory military training for all male
youth."
Cal Debates Negative
Cal debaters Juanita Olson and
Allen Jenkins built the negative case
on an alternative plan. Miss Olson
proposed a "small, highly trained
army that would be the nucleus of
a conscript army in war time."
Both affirmative and negative
speakers agreed that, "the United
States must be prepared with future
military strength." They also agreed,
"the United States has never been
prepared for any war in its history.
It's responsibility in the postwar
world will be greater than ever."
U. S. Needs Manpower
However, the affirmative speaker,
Mr. Levy, contended, "Manpower is
; needed to maintain American securi
ty, democratic institutions, and curb
I lawless aggression."
His affirmative colleague, Marshall
j Small, developed the case that com
| pulsory military training is the only
j effective method of reaching the
; manpower goal.
"A plan of universal conscription is
based on an out-moded military
j theory of mass defense," was the
j answer given by University of Cali
| fornia speaker Juanita Olsen.
! Military Training Dangerous
Her assertion was developed fur
j thcr by Mr. Jenkins who pointed out
the dangers of military training. Said
he, "Military training is incompatible
with freedom. It trains youth to take
! orders, to become mental depend
ents."
The audience, who had divided it
j self in the Education Auditorium ac
cording lo convictions and general
sympathies, questioned all four
speakers following the formal de
bate.
Today, Stanford debaters Dorothy
Wilner and Richard Jennings will go
to Berkeley to debate the negative
of the same question.
