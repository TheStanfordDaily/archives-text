# Excom Refers Nominations To Students
## 
### 
Excom, discussing Stanford's stu
dent officer nomination system last
night, made the proposal that Nom
inating Committee he abolished and
that nominations he extended over a
two-day period, with names of can
didates published by the end of the
first day.
This system, Excom feels, will be
more representative of the students
themselves, since they can watch
nominations for the various offices
and see that there is keen competi
tion in all of them. All students will
have been nominated because of
their interest in a job. Nominating
Committee has never been fully un
derstood by the students, and this
system may be more spontaneous,
according to committee members.
Now Excom asks for student
opinion on this proposal. The pros
and cons will be taken to living
groups through Women's Confer
ence and Men's Inter-Hall Coun
cil, and a vote will be taken to pass
or reject this change in nominating
machinery.
Excom also considered Boathouse
opening, Concert Office resignations
and appointments, a committee for
keeping ihe Cellar open, election
committee for spring quarter, and a
change in governmental machinery.
Lake Lagunita is not yet full
enough to set an opening date for
the Boathouse, but this announce
mment will be made as soon as pos
sible.
Excom accepted the resignations
of Assistant Manager Mary Drumm
and Beverly Lcggett of the Con
cert Office, and appointed Joe Glas
son and Annette Kirkman to the
vacant positions.
Marthe Locke, Evelyn Redmond,
Maxine Arnold, and Alice Tuttle
were appointed to a committee in
charge of keeping tjie Cellar open
this quarter and reopening it next
quarter.
J. I). Williams was appointed head
of election committee for spring
quarter. It was decided to keep the
preferential system of voting. Be
cause this system involves more than
one count of the ballots, election
hoard will release only the number
of votes of the top two candidates
for each office for publication, and
will post the remaining results the
following day.
A proposal was presented to
changc the Excom representation
from the present class basis to a
living group basis as revealed in The
Daily editorials of the past three
clays. The plan is under considera
tion, and comment is invited.

inating Committee he abolished and
that nominations he extended over a
two-day period, with names of can
didates published by the end of the
first day.
This system, Excom feels, will be
more representative of the students
themselves, since they can watch
nominations for the various offices
and see that there is keen competi
tion in all of them. All students will
have been nominated because of
their interest in a job. Nominating
Committee has never been fully un
derstood by the students, and this
system may be more spontaneous,
according to committee members.
Now Excom asks for student
opinion on this proposal. The pros
and cons will be taken to living
groups through Women's Confer
ence and Men's Inter-Hall Coun
cil, and a vote will be taken to pass
or reject this change in nominating
machinery.
Excom also considered Boathouse
opening, Concert Office resignations
and appointments, a committee for
keeping ihe Cellar open, election
committee for spring quarter, and a
change in governmental machinery.
Lake Lagunita is not yet full
enough to set an opening date for
the Boathouse, but this announce
mment will be made as soon as pos
sible.
Excom accepted the resignations
of Assistant Manager Mary Drumm
and Beverly Lcggett of the Con
cert Office, and appointed Joe Glas
son and Annette Kirkman to the
vacant positions.
Marthe Locke, Evelyn Redmond,
Maxine Arnold, and Alice Tuttle
were appointed to a committee in
charge of keeping tjie Cellar open
this quarter and reopening it next
quarter.
J. I). Williams was appointed head
of election committee for spring
quarter. It was decided to keep the
preferential system of voting. Be
cause this system involves more than
one count of the ballots, election
hoard will release only the number
of votes of the top two candidates
for each office for publication, and
will post the remaining results the
following day.
A proposal was presented to
changc the Excom representation
from the present class basis to a
living group basis as revealed in The
Daily editorials of the past three
clays. The plan is under considera
tion, and comment is invited.
