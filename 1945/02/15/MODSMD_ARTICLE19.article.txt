## 
### 
Lorrain Streblow, president of
Roble, has announced that Roble will
re-adopt the old system of selecting
freshman officers at (lie election
! scheduled for February 23.
"For the past several years Roble
, officers have been sponsors, appoint
jed by the sponsoring committee,"
| said Miss Streblow. "However, since
i most of the freshmen now in Roble
j have been here the entire year and
intend lo remain here spring quarter,
il has been decided to let them choose
J officers from their own class," she
j added.
Candidates for president, first and
] second vice-presidents, secretary,
and treasurer will be selected by a
nominating committee consisting of
Jane Vinson, Marilyn Freer, Nancy
Sharp, Mary Orr, and Joann Whit
tier. The nominees named by the
committee will be announced at
house meeting next Monday. Peti
tions with 15 signatures will be ac
cepted as further nominations up to
the following Wednesday, February
21.
According to Miss Streblow, spon
sors will remain at Roble during
spring quarter in purely non-ad
| ministrative capacities. "This will
| tend to prevent an over-balance in
J the hall of people of the same age;
j still the sponsors will be on hand to
j help with any problems which might
' arise," she explained.
