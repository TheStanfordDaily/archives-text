Feb. 15 (UP).—U.S. Eighth Army ■
troops have advanced 11 miles into |
Bataan, seizing Aducay which was
the eastern anchor of the first Amer-.l
ican defense line across the bloody I
peninsula in the dark days of Jan- j
uary 1942, Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur j
announced today.
In Manila, where street fighting
entered the 13th day, troops of the
three American divisions pressing
the trapped Japanese garrison
against the hay along a four-mile
front "are gradually compressing
the circle," his daily communique
announced.
Military observers said organized
Japanese resistance possibly would
be ended within a few days, leaving
only snipers to be mopped up.
