## Montgomery's Troops Smash German Defenses 
### 
PARIS, Thurs., Feb. 15 (UP).—
Seven spearheads of the advancing
Canadian First Army ripped two
miles into the Germans' northern
Rhineland defenses on Wednesday,

fighting into or through six towns
as thousands of Allied planes
pounded the enemy from the air in
attacks along and behind the front.
Advancing under the roar of their
planes and of massed artillery, Field
Marshal Sir B. L. Montgomery's
troops smashed deep into patched
up German defenses in multiple
drives aimed at the major transit
hubs of Goeh, Udetn, and Calcar and
at the vital Rhine ferry crossing of
Emmerich.
Tactical planes struck everywhere
along and behind the front and
joined with heavy bombers and
fighters from Britain to rake trans
portation facilities and troop move
ments east of the Rhino. The day's
total sorties numbered 7,000, a rec
ord for winter flying.
German guns, troops, ammunition
dumps, trains, motor transport, and
road junctions were flayed from
dawn until dusk as the full weight,
of Allied air power hit the enemy in
the greatest aerial slaughter since
the threat front the Ardennes bulge
last month.
