"Civil Service work will provide
a large field for postwar employ
ment as federal work at the close of
the war will not. be abruptly but
very gradually reduced to the pro
war level," was the essence of the
speech on "Postwar Government Job
Opportunities" given by Chester
Baggs, representative of the Civil
Service Commission.
The speech given at. Men's Vocom
meeting Wednesday evening in the
Toyon lobby pointed out the main
duties of the 12th Civil Service
Regional Office in San Francisco.
The prime fluty of the Regional of
fice. said Raggs, is to recruit person
nel for federal establishments, par
ticularly Army and Navy, bases
which require many civilian office
workers. The secondary duty of this
office is to promote better utilization
of Civil Service employees.
Training Provided
The Civil Service Regional office
provides training facilities to fur
ther promote better utilization. The
next basic duty of the office is the
War Veteran Placement Program
which is all the. time increasing in
importance. This program will pro
vide many jobs for those with some
experience or ability at vocational
guidance and counseling.
In tracing the history of the Civil
Service Commission Baggs empha
sized the fact that ever after the
Civil War there had been a constant
demand by the people for the in
auguration of a merit system of se
lecting government employed per
sonnel to replace the "spoils sys
tem" which had developed since
Jefferson's term of presidency and
was then still in effect.
Commission Created
The Civil Service Act of IHH.'I
totally revised this by creating a
Civil Service Commission and by
providing an impartial method of
selecting federal workers.
The usual beginning position given
a college graduate with no experi
ence is a rating of senior clerk or
junior professional assistant with a
yearly salary of $2,000 plus overtime.
Promotions are given nearly as
rapidly as the law permits now, par
ticularly in the most needed fields
such as civil engineering or voca
tional counseling.
A step in the improvement of the
federal service field will be a greater
uniformity of wage scale and classi
fication to be attained after the war
is over, Baggs stated in closing.

Jefferson's term of presidency and

Commission Created
The Civil Service Act of IHH.'I
totally revised this by creating a
Civil Service Commission and by
providing an impartial method of
selecting federal workers.
The usual beginning position given
a college graduate with no experi
ence is a rating of senior clerk or
junior professional assistant with a
yearly salary of $2,000 plus overtime.
Promotions are given nearly as
rapidly as the law permits now, par
ticularly in the most needed fields
such as civil engineering or voca
tional counseling.
A step in the improvement of the
federal service field will be a greater
uniformity of wage scale and classi
fication to be attained after the war
is over, Baggs stated in closing.
