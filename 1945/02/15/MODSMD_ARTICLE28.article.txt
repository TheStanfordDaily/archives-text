turcd the Pomeranian rail city of
Schneidemuohl, on a direct Warsaw-
Berlin railroad, after a two-week
encirclemcnt in which more than
12,000 enemy troops were killed or
captured.
To the northeast Soviet forces ad
vancing up the Polish Corridor on
a 45-mile front fought to within two
miles of the vital Danzig-Stettin-

man Pomerania.
Far to the south, Red Army forces
seized 12,700 more prisoners in cap
turing Budapest. These were mostly
