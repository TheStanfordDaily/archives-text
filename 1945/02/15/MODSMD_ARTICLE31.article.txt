# TRADITIONS-UP IN SMOKE?
## 
### 
Having been informed, in meticulous
phrases, by the School, '47, of the "time
honored tradition" that excepts law students
from the no-smoking-on-Inner Quad axiom, the
Daily did some checking of its own with Profes
sor Marion Rice Kirkwood, law school dean,
who told us that as far as he knew there was
no such "tradition" and that law students had
in the past used the Law Steps as their smoking
giounds, but never Inner Quad.
For the further benefit of those persons, law
students or not, who still ask "Gotta match?"
while standing on Quad, we quote from Dr.
Wilbur's Founders' Day address of March 9,
1944, this time with emphasis on the practical
side of "Mrs. Stanford's tradition":
". . . one of the disturbing things that come
from modern habits in the use of tobacco is the
careless way in which matches and cigarette
stubs are distributed almost anywhere and
everywhere. It develops not only a sense of
litter and untidiness but it also increases the
fire risk for our buildings and for our beautiful
campus. This non-smoking tradition is there
fore not all sentiment but has in it, as well, some
very practical values as a tradition. One rea
son why many of us love this campus is because
it is beautiful, and there are constant efforts
to keep things picked up and in reasonable
order."
The ignoring, then, of one of Stanford's oldest
traditions takes on another light—one that may
be seen by the few (we hope there are only a
few) who must be shown fire risks and possible
garden damage—the few who cannot observe a
tradition solely out of respect for and admiration
of Stanford University and its people.—H.D.
