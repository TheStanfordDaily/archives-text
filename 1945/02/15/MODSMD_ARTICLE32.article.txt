### Walrus the Carpenter 
Dear Mr. Walrus:
It may surprise you to hear from John Bell of the
year 1945 when you have recently been so busy listen
ing to John Bell of the year 2000. But you have taken
so many liberties with my name that at least I can
be assured (hat you have heard of it before.
Your column of Friday last cast some suspicion
and doubt on the authenticity of John Bell's Mem
oirs. My dear sir. surely you are jesting! Surely you
do not seriously intend to mean that these writings
which I have taken in good faith are not in reality
the Memoirs that I shall write when a little more
experience will have given me material to memo
rial i/.e.
When you started to publish my Memoirs (before
I had even written them) I admit that I was astonished,
then skeptical, but as they continued I slowly became
convinced of their truth. I am now totally convinced
of it and resent your attempt to rob me of the Presi
dency. It smacks of treason.
It did seem improbable that a major in Pure Mathe
matics would become President of the United States,
so I hurriedly my major to Political Science.
The opinions presented in my Memoirs were strange
to me, but since they are eventually to be my own
opinions I have adopted them without demur, on the
principle that I had better become used to them early.
1 have always been a reflective type of person,
given to a certain amount of introspective brooding.

I have disliked met'tiny new people and at times
have gone out of my way to avoid them. Invariably
I have snubbed total strangers who tried to engage
me in conversation.
But clearly the man who expects political office can
' not continue this behavior. Consequently I purchased
; a copy oi' "How to Win Friends and Influence People."
The play entitled "The Show-Off" taught me a lot
about how to succeed in life and I follow Johnny High
; about the campus and watch him at work. Very in-
J structive!
When I am introduced to people now I repeat their
names in a loud voice, so as to imprint them in my
memory, and I gaze into their faces with a look of great
I intensity and concentration, so that I shall not readily
forget them. When I see them again I hail them loudly
by their full name and slap them jovially on the
shoulder. One cannot begin too soon to campaign for
I the Presidency.
All this has not been without cost. At Tyler Hall
I liiid doors locked in my face. When I slap the
boys on the shoulder they punch me on the nose.
That is no way to treat the President of the United
States! They declare that they have heard enough
( of John Bell. John Bell's Memoirs, the Ivory Tower
and—l hesitate to mention it, but it is the case—even
of the Walrus himself. Mr. Smith, the Resident As
sistant, is especially annoyed and since your article
on him appeared he has canceled all my late leaves.
And now, Mr. Walrus, it looks as if 1 had done
better to stick to Pure Mathematics. Even you have
begun to express doubt about the authenticity of my
Memoirs. Please reassure me, for if they are not true I
have changed my major for nothing, I have lost my
friends at Tyler Hall for nothing and I shall punch you
on the nose at our next meeting.
Sincerely yours,
John Bell
