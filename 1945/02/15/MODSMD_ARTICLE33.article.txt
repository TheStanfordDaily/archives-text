The battle along the Eastern Front had been the
battle of the Vistula, or the pursuit following it.
Neither the Germans nor the Russians had made dras
tic alterations in their dispositions (the Russians did
shift some of their weight to the center and away
from the south), but the Russians hoped that by this
time they would be delivering the last blow of the
action that started at Warsaw.
However, the Germans used their river line to
good advantage. It was not as good as it could he,
since infantry could easily establish bridgeheads at
some points by going over ice jams, but the enemy
could gain time long enough to redistribute his forces.
In that respect, the Oder was to the Germans what
the Marne was to the French in 1914, what the Vistula
was to the Poles in 1920.
The first thing that happened was that the Russians
tried to continue their drive straight ahead. Marshal
Zhukov, in the center of the line, tried to powerhouse
his way across the Oder to Berlin without further ado.
But this attempt was stopped. Then the Russians
tried a different game. They realized that the only
way the Germans could have bolstered their center
was to shift troops from their wings, and they tried to
make the enemy move them back again by attacking
on their own flanks.
The general idea seems to be to put so much
pressure on the Germans in the south and the north
that they will have to denude their center, and thus
a breakthrough to Berlin would become a simple
matter. The game is very old. Napoleon invented a
version of it at Austerlitz; McClellan tried to apply
it on the Antietam in IKG2, but failed, and Grant used
it with good success at Chattanooga in 1X63.
The application in this case seems to be running
as follows. Marshal Zhukov is trying to work north,
toward Stettin and the isolation of Pomei'ania, while
Marshal Konev, in Silesia, is trying to conquer that
province and to poise for a breakthrough into south
eastern Saxony.
But this game might not work. First of all, the
Germans will probably establish their Silesian or
southern defense lines on the borders of that prov
ince. where they will he covered by hills and forests.
The enemy might hold this with light forces. Sec
ondly, Zhukov is not making enough progress toward
Stettin to be a threat.
However, there is a report today that Zhukov has
forged ahead in his center again, and the Russians
might now be trying to bring the battle to its last and
decisive phase. What will happen remains to be seen.
Besides this new advance, the most significant news
of the Eastern Front is that the Russians finally have
Budapest. With this rail junction as a base, they might
make good gains in Hungary and eventually Austria,
since the Germans are in too much trouble around
Berlin to worry about the Balkan front.
