Those who stood up and voted for the labor draft,
whether they knew it or not, were in precisely the
same position as those parliamentarians who advocated
the Republic of France in favor of Vichy. Most of
them were well-meaning, but without understanding.
Perhaps we can forgive them their crime, but we would
be fools to maintain them in office. I do not hesitate
to assert that those who support this kind of a legisla
tion are not the kind of men with whom America can
afford to trust its post-war problems.
Towards Freedom
Those of us who still believe in the essential dignity
of man do not for a moment concede that there is a
method superior to that of the democratic; we do not
for a moment believe that slave labor is superior to
free labor. Throughout the ages the working class has
produced all the goods of the earth—it asks no higher
privilege than that of continuing to do so. That it has
failed now we do not believe.
We believe that the American way of securing labor
in scarce areas is to raise the wage structure, so as
to attract labor; we do not believe that the fact that
this would cut into the huge profits of business is our
first concern. We know that the common people are
doing all the fighting and dying; we do not believe
that they should also do all the paying. We would
remind you that the society which we seek is still a
society of free men.
