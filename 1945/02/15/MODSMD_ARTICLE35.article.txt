Presenting Paris in a gayer mood
;ii c his "Conciergerie ' and "Moulin
Rou,Most of Levin's works are

done in gouache — bold, strong,
somewhat expr essionistic pictures
which retain an inherent French
flavor under the impulse of a Slavic
temperament.
Of the oils, a group belongs to j

riod, a few are of religious theme; I
then there are more recent pictures,
still lifes and landscapes painted
since Levin's arrival in America.
