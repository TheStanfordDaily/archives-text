(Editorial note: This is our sec
ond article on postwar France.)

"Impossible," said Dr. Georges Le
maitre, when asked his opinion of
postwar France. "I cannot predict
the future. I can only tell of the
definite trends in France today."
Three of these are very significant,
he feels. (1) New unity, (2) a gen
eral move to the Left, and (3) sud
den moderation displayed by the
Communists. Added together they
show the way France is drifting.
Background
Since the French revolution two
groups of parties have battled in
France, those who approved of the
revolution and those who didn't, the
Leftists and the reactionaries. Some
times they have joined, but only
against a strong common enemy, and
always with the understanding that
this was only a temporary truce. In
1914, for instance, they formed the
"Union Sacree" against the Ger
mans, but in 1919 they flew at each
other's throats more fiercely than
ever. For twenty years they were
locked in bitter, constant struggle.
Small wonder that the Germans
invaded France so easily in 1940. For
years the reactionaries had been

shouting, "Rather Hitler than Blum."
France was so divided that not even
fear of the Germans could unite the
two factions.
"The outstanding fact in the pres
ent situation," states Dr. Lemaitre,
"is that the deep causes for this
internecine feud have disappeared
completely."
"How has this happened?" we
asked.
How Come Unity?
"The reactionaries finally tested
their ideas and found them a fail
ure," was his answer. "Also the
members of opposed parties found
that their opponents were pretty de
cent fellows after all."
Petain was a reactionary who
thought he could use Hitler to turn
back the clock. For two years Hitler
treated Vichy-Franco with kid
gloves in the hope of making her an
ally. Petain had the chance (with
German support, but little interfer
ence on their part) to try his pre
revolutionary ideas. It was soon
found out, however, that they could
not work in a modern industrialized
country, and so it became evident
that the reactionary program had
been wrong.
In 1942 French economy went to

. pieces, and Hitler was forced to take
a stronger grip on France. At the
j same time lie was attacking Russia,
I and Russia ordered French Commu
! nists "to resist," Communists and
j disillusioned reactionaries "resisted"
together, and the Germans began to
get nervous. A nervous German can
| be very unpleasant, and retaliations
I began. In the feverish atmosphere
of the "resistance" the Communists
j and conservatives began to know and
j appreciate one another better.
I Give and Take
For instance, a Catholic priest
might save a hunted Communist, and
j the latter would be grateful. If the
| Communist was captured later, he
would refuse even under torture to
! tell that the priest had sheltered him.
Now the priest was grateful. Each
! began to realize that the other was
j a pretty decent human being.
At last the reactionaries realized
they could not go back to Louis XIV.
I so they began to think of going for
ward. Progress didn't sound so bad
j now that they had discovered what
j fine fellows some of these "Leftists"
| were. Today they feel that soqjal re
[ forms are not only inevitable but
! desirable.

This trend toward the Left is par
ticularly notable among the Catho
lics, who had for a long time been
the main support of the conserva
tive groups. A new very large
and powerful Catholic party called
"Mouvement Republieain Populaire"
openly advocates the nationalization
of industries. Georces Bidault. the
present Minister of Foreign Affairs,
belongs to that party; and General
de Gaulle, himself a fervent Catho
lic, though not personally affiliated
with any group, seems to be defi
nitely in sympathy with this pro
gram.
Communist Surprise
The attitude of the Communists
since the liberation has been an ob
ject of surprise to all. Everybody
expected that they would be the
first in hanging collaborationists
from lamp posts, and that they
would take advantage of the troub
led situation in ihe country to try
to seize power by force.
Instead, the secretary of the Com

munist party, Maurice Thorez, offi
cially demanded a fair trial for col
laborationists before the courts,
asked for the dissolution of all thi
n-regular armed groups, and finally
declared: "O'n doit faire confiance
aux forces de la democratic.
This extremely conciliatory stand
on the part of the Communists has
done much to accentuate the drift
of French public opinion toward the
Left.
So What?
Such is the situation in France,
says Dr. Lemaitre, and we Anglo-
Saxons must be careful not to
the French further toward Commu
i nism and Russia. In the past our
j American State Department does
' not always seem to have had ade
! quate information about the new
| conditions prevailing in Europe, and
' has often bet on some wrong horse.
; Our attempt to set up a government
under dliraud was a bad mistake.
| Such mistakes must not happen
| again.

"Impossible," said Dr. Georges Le
maitre, when asked his opinion of
postwar France. "I cannot predict
the future. I can only tell of the
definite trends in France today."
Three of these are very significant,
he feels. (1) New unity, (2) a gen
eral move to the Left, and (3) sud
den moderation displayed by the
Communists. Added together they
show the way France is drifting.
Background
Since the French revolution two
groups of parties have battled in
France, those who approved of the
revolution and those who didn't, the
Leftists and the reactionaries. Some
times they have joined, but only
against a strong common enemy, and
always with the understanding that
this was only a temporary truce. In
1914, for instance, they formed the
"Union Sacree" against the Ger
mans, but in 1919 they flew at each
other's throats more fiercely than
ever. For twenty years they were
locked in bitter, constant struggle.
Small wonder that the Germans
invaded France so easily in 1940. For
years the reactionaries had been

shouting, "Rather Hitler than Blum."
France was so divided that not even
fear of the Germans could unite the
two factions.
"The outstanding fact in the pres
ent situation," states Dr. Lemaitre,
"is that the deep causes for this
internecine feud have disappeared
completely."
"How has this happened?" we
asked.
How Come Unity?
"The reactionaries finally tested
their ideas and found them a fail
ure," was his answer. "Also the
members of opposed parties found
that their opponents were pretty de
cent fellows after all."
Petain was a reactionary who
thought he could use Hitler to turn
back the clock. For two years Hitler
treated Vichy-Franco with kid
gloves in the hope of making her an
ally. Petain had the chance (with
German support, but little interfer
ence on their part) to try his pre
revolutionary ideas. It was soon
found out, however, that they could
not work in a modern industrialized
country, and so it became evident
that the reactionary program had
been wrong.
In 1942 French economy went to

. pieces, and Hitler was forced to take
a stronger grip on France. At the
j same time lie was attacking Russia,
I and Russia ordered French Commu
! nists "to resist," Communists and
j disillusioned reactionaries "resisted"
together, and the Germans began to
get nervous. A nervous German can
| be very unpleasant, and retaliations
I began. In the feverish atmosphere
of the "resistance" the Communists
j and conservatives began to know and
j appreciate one another better.
I Give and Take
For instance, a Catholic priest
might save a hunted Communist, and
j the latter would be grateful. If the
| Communist was captured later, he
would refuse even under torture to
! tell that the priest had sheltered him.
Now the priest was grateful. Each
! began to realize that the other was
j a pretty decent human being.
At last the reactionaries realized
they could not go back to Louis XIV.
I so they began to think of going for
ward. Progress didn't sound so bad
j now that they had discovered what
j fine fellows some of these "Leftists"
| were. Today they feel that soqjal re
[ forms are not only inevitable but
! desirable.

This trend toward the Left is par
ticularly notable among the Catho
lics, who had for a long time been
the main support of the conserva
tive groups. A new very large
and powerful Catholic party called
"Mouvement Republieain Populaire"
openly advocates the nationalization
of industries. Georces Bidault. the
present Minister of Foreign Affairs,
belongs to that party; and General
de Gaulle, himself a fervent Catho
lic, though not personally affiliated
with any group, seems to be defi
nitely in sympathy with this pro
gram.
Communist Surprise
The attitude of the Communists
since the liberation has been an ob
ject of surprise to all. Everybody
expected that they would be the
first in hanging collaborationists
from lamp posts, and that they
would take advantage of the troub
led situation in ihe country to try
to seize power by force.
Instead, the secretary of the Com

munist party, Maurice Thorez, offi
cially demanded a fair trial for col
laborationists before the courts,
asked for the dissolution of all thi
n-regular armed groups, and finally
declared: "O'n doit faire confiance
aux forces de la democratic.
This extremely conciliatory stand
on the part of the Communists has
done much to accentuate the drift
of French public opinion toward the
Left.
So What?
Such is the situation in France,
says Dr. Lemaitre, and we Anglo-
Saxons must be careful not to
the French further toward Commu
i nism and Russia. In the past our
j American State Department does
' not always seem to have had ade
! quate information about the new
| conditions prevailing in Europe, and
' has often bet on some wrong horse.
; Our attempt to set up a government
under dliraud was a bad mistake.
| Such mistakes must not happen
| again.

postwar France. "I cannot predict
the future. I can only tell of the
definite trends in France today."
Three of these are very significant,
he feels. (1) New unity, (2) a gen
eral move to the Left, and (3) sud
den moderation displayed by the
Communists. Added together they
show the way France is drifting.
Background
Since the French revolution two
groups of parties have battled in
France, those who approved of the
revolution and those who didn't, the
Leftists and the reactionaries. Some
times they have joined, but only
against a strong common enemy, and
always with the understanding that
this was only a temporary truce. In
1914, for instance, they formed the
"Union Sacree" against the Ger
mans, but in 1919 they flew at each
other's throats more fiercely than
ever. For twenty years they were
locked in bitter, constant struggle.
Small wonder that the Germans
invaded France so easily in 1940. For
years the reactionaries had been

shouting, "Rather Hitler than Blum."
France was so divided that not even
fear of the Germans could unite the
two factions.
"The outstanding fact in the pres
ent situation," states Dr. Lemaitre,
"is that the deep causes for this
internecine feud have disappeared
completely."
"How has this happened?" we
asked.
How Come Unity?
"The reactionaries finally tested
their ideas and found them a fail
ure," was his answer. "Also the
members of opposed parties found
that their opponents were pretty de
cent fellows after all."
Petain was a reactionary who
thought he could use Hitler to turn
back the clock. For two years Hitler
treated Vichy-Franco with kid
gloves in the hope of making her an
ally. Petain had the chance (with
German support, but little interfer
ence on their part) to try his pre
revolutionary ideas. It was soon
found out, however, that they could
not work in a modern industrialized
country, and so it became evident
that the reactionary program had
been wrong.
In 1942 French economy went to

. pieces, and Hitler was forced to take
a stronger grip on France. At the
j same time lie was attacking Russia,
I and Russia ordered French Commu
! nists "to resist," Communists and
j disillusioned reactionaries "resisted"
together, and the Germans began to
get nervous. A nervous German can
| be very unpleasant, and retaliations
I began. In the feverish atmosphere
of the "resistance" the Communists
j and conservatives began to know and
j appreciate one another better.
I Give and Take
For instance, a Catholic priest
might save a hunted Communist, and
j the latter would be grateful. If the
| Communist was captured later, he
would refuse even under torture to
! tell that the priest had sheltered him.
Now the priest was grateful. Each
! began to realize that the other was
j a pretty decent human being.
At last the reactionaries realized
they could not go back to Louis XIV.
I so they began to think of going for
ward. Progress didn't sound so bad
j now that they had discovered what
j fine fellows some of these "Leftists"
| were. Today they feel that soqjal re
[ forms are not only inevitable but
! desirable.

This trend toward the Left is par
ticularly notable among the Catho
lics, who had for a long time been
the main support of the conserva
tive groups. A new very large
and powerful Catholic party called
"Mouvement Republieain Populaire"
openly advocates the nationalization
of industries. Georces Bidault. the
present Minister of Foreign Affairs,
belongs to that party; and General
de Gaulle, himself a fervent Catho
lic, though not personally affiliated
with any group, seems to be defi
nitely in sympathy with this pro
gram.
Communist Surprise
The attitude of the Communists
since the liberation has been an ob
ject of surprise to all. Everybody
expected that they would be the
first in hanging collaborationists
from lamp posts, and that they
would take advantage of the troub
led situation in ihe country to try
to seize power by force.
Instead, the secretary of the Com

munist party, Maurice Thorez, offi
cially demanded a fair trial for col
laborationists before the courts,
asked for the dissolution of all thi
n-regular armed groups, and finally
declared: "O'n doit faire confiance
aux forces de la democratic.
This extremely conciliatory stand
on the part of the Communists has
done much to accentuate the drift
of French public opinion toward the
Left.
So What?
Such is the situation in France,
says Dr. Lemaitre, and we Anglo-
Saxons must be careful not to
the French further toward Commu
i nism and Russia. In the past our
j American State Department does
' not always seem to have had ade
! quate information about the new
| conditions prevailing in Europe, and
' has often bet on some wrong horse.
; Our attempt to set up a government
under dliraud was a bad mistake.
| Such mistakes must not happen
| again.

ond article on postwar France.)
