After seeing Bacall working for |
the Yankee dallah in old Martinique. I
I have come to the conclusion that
sex is here to stay. The Have or
Have Not lines have become a na
tional institution, or rather a Farm
institution, as Stanford women stand
around with their hair disheveled,
leaning against doors, and asking
for countless matches. Three-fourths i
of the men are practicing their
whistling techniques and shaving
regularly.
Keep It Clean!
Rumor that the local humor mag I
(what a kidder!) the Chappie is soon i
to appear on the streets (don't think
that isn't a good place for it) has
caused a tremendous burst of en
thusiasm (in the hearts of Drisc and
Gugel) on the Quad. Filled with
plagiarized jokes and drawings, it
has tended to a certain extent to
arouse a little mirth in the student
body, who have even on occasion
read this column.
Let's hope that their fertile minds
can concoct something funny for a
change—also print a few more as I
want one too.
Go Jump in the Lake
The sudden surge of beautiful
weather is fine for the old afternoons
in the country, etc., but awfully hard
on the lake. If it doesn't rain more,
the beautiful lake will be a breeding '
ground for frogs and a swell spot to I
get material for a mud pack.
Let's all hope for a good rain pe
riod for about two weeks .straight j
and then the possibility that the lake i
will be good all of spring quarter is {
in the bag, for it's awfully hard to j
go swimming in the mud and canoe
ing over weeds.

Congratulations to the sophs on j
their tremendous cotillion. The work
of a very minute part of the soph
class, they did very well in their
decorations and food, to say nothing
of a good band. Glassman's band is !
one of the best heard on the campus
in several months and should be
heard from for a while.
