# Pacific Danger, Bugs, Not Bullets, Says Dr. Bowers

### RUTH GORDON 
"Our greatest danger in the Pacific is not from bullets but from bugs—
20 to 1 in their favor," sated Dr. Nathan A. Bowers, editor of Engineering
News Record, in his speech last night before the Stanford Student Chap
ter of the American Society of Civil Engineers. "There are two tropical
diseases carried by mosquitoes for which medicine as yet has no reme-

dies, and mosquito netting does little
good in an air raid."
Bowers, who received his Ph.D.
degree in Civil Engineering at Stan
ford in 192G and was the first man
to get that degree from here, re
turned recently from a 28,000-mile
tour of the South Pacific as an ac
credited member of Admiral Nimitz'
staff to report on the construction
activities of the Seabees.
Do Construction Work
The activities of this branch of
the service, approximately 250,000
men in all, are the greatest con
struction operations of all time, Dr.
Bowers explained. "The reports of
the Pacific war can be compared to
an iceberg—ten-elevenths is under
water—the stepping stones to the
fronts built by the Seabees are that
ten-elevenths, without which our
forces could get nowhere!"
The Seabees were recruited be
cause of their experience in the
construction field, and these men
can well be called the construction
industries' best contributions to the
war effort, but they will come back
as even greater assets to their coun
try because they will be strength

ened in character and wiser in judg
ment, was the opinion of Dr. Bowers.
Is Equipment Area
Dr. Bowers continued that the
Pacific is an equipment proving
ground because the equipment is
put under very severe service, and
you cannot get spare parts. "The
lot of the Seabees is blood, sweat,
j tears, and no spare parts, and con
j struction equipment repair depots
j designed to repair 100 pieces of
j equipment a month are fixing 300,
j working 24 hours a day. The men
j work 12-hour shifts, seven days a
I week."
