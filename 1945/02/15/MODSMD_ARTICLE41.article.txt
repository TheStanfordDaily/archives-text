# New Advisory Plan Deemed Successful
## 
### 
"The excellent cooperation and interest shown by both students and
, faculty in the new lower division advisory plan have more than fulfilled
our expectations," said Dr. H. Donald Winbigler, associate registrar, at a
recent interview.
According lo Dr. Winbigler, the plan, which was inaugurated last quar-

'ter, consists of two major changes
over the old lower division program
—there are more advisors for the
same number of students and ones
not necessarily connected with the
department of the student's major
interest.
Grew From Conferences
The plan was an out-growth of
conferences which Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder, then newly appointed
President of Stanford, held last win
ter at his home with various faculty
members. At these sessions, Dr.
Tresidder heard reports on Univer- J
sity activity and found that the low- J
er division advisory program then in
effect had definite weaknesses.
The late Dr. Hoyt H. Hudson was i
appointed chairman of the new lower I
division committee, which was in
charge of investigating the fallacies
of the old plan and outlining an
improved program. After Dr. Hud
son's death last summer, Dr. Willis
H. Johnson assumed the chairman
ship and is serving in that capacity
at present.
Advisors Have Small Groups
Dr. Winbigler pointed out that [
under the old program, students were j
assigned to advisors within the de- |
partments of their major fields of '
study. "This brought about an un
balanced distribution of students
among advisors, and also a preju
diced outlook on courses outside
their particular fields," he said.
"Under the present system," con
tinued Dr. Winbigler, "each advisor
is in charge of counseling not more
than 25 students. In this way the
advisor and student have an oppor
tunity to become personally ac
quainted. Since the advisor isn't
necessarily within the student's
major department, the student re
ceives a more liberal view by which
to outline his program. In case some
question arises concerning the stu
dent's major, he may receive advice
from that particular department."
Johnson Committee Head
Advisors are under the jurisdic
tion of a lower division committee,
composed of 13 members, and meet
monthly with this committee. Dr. I
Johnson, chairman of the plan, has
announced that the reactions of the
advisors at these meetings have been
excellent.
"One of our doubts when we in
augurated the plan," said Dr. John
son, "was that the faculty wouldn't
be willing to give as much time to
their advisory duties as a successful I
application of the program would j
require. However, they have proved j
to be vitally interested. Furthermore, ]
the advisors are becoming more pro
ficient through their counseling ac
tivities and through comparing prob
lems and methods at our monthly j
meetings, and should continue to I
show improvement."

our expectations," said Dr. H. Donald Winbigler, associate registrar, at a
recent interview.
According lo Dr. Winbigler, the plan, which was inaugurated last quar-

'ter, consists of two major changes
over the old lower division program
—there are more advisors for the
same number of students and ones
not necessarily connected with the
department of the student's major
interest.
Grew From Conferences
The plan was an out-growth of
conferences which Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder, then newly appointed
President of Stanford, held last win
ter at his home with various faculty
members. At these sessions, Dr.
Tresidder heard reports on Univer- J
sity activity and found that the low- J
er division advisory program then in
effect had definite weaknesses.
The late Dr. Hoyt H. Hudson was i
appointed chairman of the new lower I
division committee, which was in
charge of investigating the fallacies
of the old plan and outlining an
improved program. After Dr. Hud
son's death last summer, Dr. Willis
H. Johnson assumed the chairman
ship and is serving in that capacity
at present.
Advisors Have Small Groups
Dr. Winbigler pointed out that [
under the old program, students were j
assigned to advisors within the de- |
partments of their major fields of '
study. "This brought about an un
balanced distribution of students
among advisors, and also a preju
diced outlook on courses outside
their particular fields," he said.
"Under the present system," con
tinued Dr. Winbigler, "each advisor
is in charge of counseling not more
than 25 students. In this way the
advisor and student have an oppor
tunity to become personally ac
quainted. Since the advisor isn't
necessarily within the student's
major department, the student re
ceives a more liberal view by which
to outline his program. In case some
question arises concerning the stu
dent's major, he may receive advice
from that particular department."
Johnson Committee Head
Advisors are under the jurisdic
tion of a lower division committee,
composed of 13 members, and meet
monthly with this committee. Dr. I
Johnson, chairman of the plan, has
announced that the reactions of the
advisors at these meetings have been
excellent.
"One of our doubts when we in
augurated the plan," said Dr. John
son, "was that the faculty wouldn't
be willing to give as much time to
their advisory duties as a successful I
application of the program would j
require. However, they have proved j
to be vitally interested. Furthermore, ]
the advisors are becoming more pro
ficient through their counseling ac
tivities and through comparing prob
lems and methods at our monthly j
meetings, and should continue to I
show improvement."
"The excellent cooperation and interest shown by both students and
, faculty in the new lower division advisory plan have more than fulfilled
our expectations," said Dr. H. Donald Winbigler, associate registrar, at a
recent interview.
