# Tyler, Chinese Club Vie Tonight
## 
### MORT COHEN 
In what should be a fitting climax
to the terrific Phi Psi-Beta game of
last Tuesday, the Chinese Club and
Tyler will have it out tonight at
7:15. Both these teams are good, but
the Chinese Club rates as close
favorites, what with their previous
record. However, Tyler, with Mc-
Dowell, Egan, and Fox is good
enough to dump anyone when it
gets hot. All of these boys are sure
shots, and with a little luck, could
even give the Independents a good
fight.
Another close game should be the
Legal Eagle-Gerona affair. The Law
yers, still hot from their victory over
Tyler, will be up against stiff op
position. The Eagles, though, with
Hartwell, Hushy, and Keller, will
probably remain on top.
The Med. 11-Grizzlies game will
probably go all the way with the
Medics. So far, they have done very
well for themselves, and from all
indications will continue to do so.
In the only other game of the
evening, the Strangers will vie with
the Arguello Whites, in what should
be another close game. Neither team
has as yet shown much greatness,
but both teams can be dangerous.
It looks as though the squad that
has "Lady Luck" on its side will
emerge victorious.
