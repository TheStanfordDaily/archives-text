# Chief Traces History Of Old Fire Department
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
The Stanford Fire Department, be
ginning back in 1880 with little more
than an old hand pump bought by
Leland Stanford from Boston, but
gradually increasing its size in sub
sequent years 10 its present state,
marks an interesting development.
Tracing its history, Chief John
Marston told of the addition to the
department of two hand-drawn hose
carts and a hand-drawn hook and
ladder about 1890 or so; and then in

1913, the proud arrival of an actual
fire engine, one of Henry Ford's
first, and along with this two new
hoses and chemical trucks. In the
days of the old hand-drawn wagons
; it was apparently quite a sight when
the boys broke out for a fire what
with the whistles and bells along
with the running men and horses;
and in the early twenties further
| augmented by the sporadic popping
j of the engines!
I New Equipment Added
But the times changed rapidly, and

in 1922 a sjeek Seagrave Pumper was !
added to the department, "the pride ]
of the peninsula," according to
Marston, and "after 13 years, still
running smoothly." Gradually the
department was strengthened with
all types of the best equipment, until
today it ranks right along with the
best fire departments.
Marston added, "We now have a
resuscitator of the latest design, life
nets, four trucks, and 30,000 feet of
hose on the campus along with 400
extinguishers."
Alarms on Each Floor
"All the big buildings are fitted ]
with auxiliary alarms on every floor, j
ready to flash an alarm to the sta- i
tion instantly." The department is on 1
an eternal watch, with half the fire- J
men on duty all the time. Prior to
the depression around 1933, all fire
men were corporation yard employ
ees from Palo Alto, but now students
are a definite complement of the
force, with the regulars being only
the nucleus.
Marston thinks a lot of his student
firemen; "the students are a bunch
of good hard working guys," he re
marked; "our fire house is just like
any fraternity," he added, with a
proud grin, "only we keep it neat." ;
Although Chief Marston has fought !
fires for quite a few years, this is j
only his third year here on the cam- i
pus, being preceded by three other |
chiefs, Hatley, Dugan, and Lamb. ;
But still, he recalled a few interest- i
ing stories in the last couple of j
years.
Tells of Tcrman Fire
In November of 1942, Lewis Tcr
man, emeritus professor of psychol
ogy, was almost burned to death in
his home back in the hills. It was
the morning of the last big game
with California, and it so happened
that two boys driving down Palm
drive about 4 a.m., Art Wcller and
Verne Freeman, noticed smoke com
ing from the Terman home. Hurry
ing to the scene; they pulled Pro
fessor Terman's unconscious body
safely out of reach of the impending
flames.
"We also had a quite a blaze on
the fourth floor of Sequoia in 1942"
Marston said; "soldiers in the Civil
ian Defense program living on the
first floor took care of it pretty well."
"Usually," he added, "the students
can catch the small blazes when j
they get together and drown it or j
stamp it out, especially in men's
halls."
Satisfied With Department
Marston is quite satisfied with his
compact, efficient little fire depart
ment. He's got a good bunch of fire
men and some tip-top equipment.
According to Marston, "our fire
house is unique in being one of the
few, if not the only, university fire
departments in the country." Mar
ston and his men are apparently
doing a good job. since the depart
ment may average 150 calls a year,
and yet fire losses are steadily de
creasing. As a final remark Marston j
said, "we're ready to answer a call
to anything from a cat in a tree to |
a pumping job in the Union's base- !
ment."

Tells of Tcrman Fire
In November of 1942, Lewis Tcr
man, emeritus professor of psychol
ogy, was almost burned to death in
his home back in the hills. It was
the morning of the last big game
with California, and it so happened
that two boys driving down Palm
drive about 4 a.m., Art Wcller and
Verne Freeman, noticed smoke com
ing from the Terman home. Hurry
ing to the scene; they pulled Pro
fessor Terman's unconscious body
safely out of reach of the impending
flames.
"We also had a quite a blaze on
the fourth floor of Sequoia in 1942"
Marston said; "soldiers in the Civil
ian Defense program living on the
first floor took care of it pretty well."
"Usually," he added, "the students
can catch the small blazes when j
they get together and drown it or j
stamp it out, especially in men's
halls."
Satisfied With Department
Marston is quite satisfied with his
compact, efficient little fire depart
ment. He's got a good bunch of fire
men and some tip-top equipment.
According to Marston, "our fire
house is unique in being one of the
few, if not the only, university fire
departments in the country." Mar
ston and his men are apparently
doing a good job. since the depart
ment may average 150 calls a year,
and yet fire losses are steadily de
creasing. As a final remark Marston j
said, "we're ready to answer a call
to anything from a cat in a tree to |
a pumping job in the Union's base- !
ment."



JOHN MARSTON . . . Stanford Fire Chief
The Stanford Fire Department, be
ginning back in 1880 with little more
than an old hand pump bought by
Leland Stanford from Boston, but
gradually increasing its size in sub
sequent years 10 its present state,
marks an interesting development.
Tracing its history, Chief John
Marston told of the addition to the
department of two hand-drawn hose
carts and a hand-drawn hook and
ladder about 1890 or so; and then in

1913, the proud arrival of an actual
fire engine, one of Henry Ford's
first, and along with this two new
hoses and chemical trucks. In the
days of the old hand-drawn wagons
; it was apparently quite a sight when
the boys broke out for a fire what
with the whistles and bells along
with the running men and horses;
and in the early twenties further
| augmented by the sporadic popping
j of the engines!
I New Equipment Added
But the times changed rapidly, and

in 1922 a sjeek Seagrave Pumper was !
added to the department, "the pride ]
of the peninsula," according to
Marston, and "after 13 years, still
running smoothly." Gradually the
department was strengthened with
all types of the best equipment, until
today it ranks right along with the
best fire departments.
Marston added, "We now have a
resuscitator of the latest design, life
nets, four trucks, and 30,000 feet of
hose on the campus along with 400
extinguishers."
Alarms on Each Floor
"All the big buildings are fitted ]
with auxiliary alarms on every floor, j
ready to flash an alarm to the sta- i
tion instantly." The department is on 1
an eternal watch, with half the fire- J
men on duty all the time. Prior to
the depression around 1933, all fire
men were corporation yard employ
ees from Palo Alto, but now students
are a definite complement of the
force, with the regulars being only
the nucleus.
