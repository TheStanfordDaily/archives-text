# Divot Diggers Delve Down Deep
## 
### CONNIE McGILLICUDDY 
Let us say that the day is beauti
ful, that never was sky so blue, nor
weather so fair. Let us further as
sume that the green, stretching
away smoothly, offers temptation to
the golfer to send a ball down the
green in a lovely arc. But what
happens?
Divot digging, otherwise known as
the spring plowing, is a popular
sport. Actually, these green golfers
are grim-eyed zealots. They address
the ball; they check the stance; they
swing with incredible gusto; and,
turning to the blue horizon, they
look for the ball. But the little white
ball is still at home plate.
And then there are the weed
waders, those lost souls who wan
der disconsolately through the
tall grass, occasionally brandish
ing an angry club. Theme song:
"Green grow the rushesâ€”O where
did that ball go?" with a spirited
chorus.
The delusion began with a maga
zine story I once read where the
sport was delightfully easy. This
gay golfer teed off with magnificent
nonchalance, his'drives were a thing
to see, and he always sank his putts.
Such stories lead people astray.
They would have you think golf is
easy.
Golf IS easy. All you do is hold
your hands like this, and swing
like this, see? Okay, I'll demon
strate. Watch this one! ?xx$!&?!
Golf, I repeat, is easy. It just takes
patience and time.
