# Chess Set On Display At Bookstore
## 
### GRETA SIEMENS 
They stand in the Bookstore win
dow ready for battle. Each king—the
Crusader and the Infidel—with his
queen; the crusading knight in his
armour and the defender in his
desert attire; the Christian bishops
armed by God, and the opposing
priests by their Almighty; the
squarely cut European castles against
the rounded roofs of the Near East;
and each serf and vassal ready to
defend his individual lord against
j the onslaught of the desert shepherds
i and warriors. And yet, there is no
i one to plunge one against the other;
j these are silent warriors without a
i cause—a chess set without players.
Worth $425
The creator of this wooden scene
is Gustav de Packh. Carved for his
own use, the set has been valued at
$425. Each piece is an individual;
each pawn matches its masterpiece;
there is no duplication. The wood
used in the set is eucalyptus and
pear wood which has been carved
in minute detail and is faithfully
representative of the costumes, war
equipment, and architecture of the
! Middle Ages.
The detail and obvious care that
went into the making of this set is a
I characteristic of the carver, Mr. de
j Packh. He is a woodcarver by trade,
j although he has worked in leather,
j in designing jewelry, and has been
j schooled in the sculpturing of clay
I and stone.
Native of New York
Born and reared in New York
City, Mr. de Packh was sent to
Vienna to study art, and there he
learned sculpturing in clay and stone,
but chose his medium of expression
in wood. For many years woodcarv
ing was a hobby with him, while he
designed jewelry in New York's
Maiden Lane.
Later, he went into leather work,
and created everything from novelty
pieces to luggage. He was sent west
to represent his firm in California,
and that is when he went into wood
work for his own enjoyment.
After awhile, in Los Angeles, he
was doing wholesale work, but when
he was troubled by labor difficulties
he left the wholesale house to open
j a small shop in Carmel. He came to
Palo Alto a few years ago, and he
i is still living here.
Not only is Mr. de Packh a creative
artist but he designs and makes his
own tools. He works quickly: in an
uninterrupted day he could turn out
65 small objects. Many of the wooden
pieces in the Bookshop are articles
he has carved. The "Li'l Indian"
pins, book-ends and key rings; the
monogrammed book-ends and key
rings; and the guest books , are all
Mr. de Packh's work.
(The data concerning Mr. de
Packh's life was obtained from the
"Carmel Pine Cone," February 18,
1938.)
