# Yuk! Yuk?
## Chappie Out Wednesday 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
Fighting her way through a mob
of autograph seekers, your reporter
cornered Old Boy Dick Driseoll in

the spacious of
fices of the
Chaparral in
order to get the
latest dope on the
Winter Chappie
and the big con
test.
"Th e Winter
Chaparral will be
m on u m en tal,"
Driscoll quipped.
'"It's the funniest
thing that's ever
been printed, and
to say that every
thing in it is a

top-notch pieec of work is to make a
mild understatement. Besides that,
it's good!"
Gilbert Sings Spiritual
Your reporter then left the Old
Boy to drivel over pictures of the
queens of the month and dropped
into the Biz Office, where she found
Manager Bill Gilbert cheerfully sing
ing an old Negro spiritual. As he
j sang he gayly kept time by beating
the backs of office assistants with
his Rhinosaurous-hide bull whip.
"Throw out mo' copy.
Don't look so sad.
Gilbert's gwina sell
Another 2 page ad!"
Gugel and Brecr, in black-face,
then shuffled through the office sing
i ing ihe chorus:
"Drisc gets out the copy,
Copy, Copy.
Gilbert sells an ad
And then the copy's dead."
Sccond Verse
After the chorus, Driscoll stepped
in, disguised as Uncle Tom's Cabin
| and bellowed out the second verse:
"Yo ain't gwinc to kill it.
Yo's just outa luck.
I'm gwina run dat copy
So Yuk. Yuk, Yuk.
As your reporter left, the entire
Chappie crew was seen soft-shociny
down to the press singing the final
j chorus:
"It's out next Wednesday,
Wednesday, or Friday.
Out next Wednesday
Fo' 25 cents!"
