## 
### CONNIE McGILLICUDDY 
When Queen Victoria said, "We arc not amused." that was that. But
when the Japanese minister protested "The Mikado," Gilbert and Sullivan's
latest hit, Victoria reversed her decision. "This time," she said, "we are
amused." Such was the story told by Mr. Cedric van Nibroc of the Savoy
Opera Company in the Memorial Hall yesterday at 1 p.m.
With Mr. van Nibroc were three of the principal singers of the company:

► Virginia Blair, soprano; Claramae
Turner, contralto; Marsden Argall,
baritone. An at;ile accompanist was
George Cory, and not to be forgot
ten was Harry Corbctt as the um
brella carrier in Act II of "The Mi
kado."
Opera Scenes Presented
Scenes were presented from"The
Pirates of Penzance," "Ruddigore,"
i "H.M.S. Pinamore," and"The Mi
kado." From"The Pirates of Pen
zance" Miss Blair sang the aria
"Poor Wand'ring One," from Act 11.
There were four scenes given from
"Ruddigote": Mad Margaret's scene
from Act I was sung and dramatized
by Miss Turner; Sir Despard's aria
by Mr. Argall; the Etiquette aria,
! sung by Miss Blair; and a duet from
the second act, sung by Miss Turner
and Mr. Argall.
"Pinafore" was represented by
"The Hours Creep On Apace" from
the second act, sung by Miss Blair.
Miss Turner .sang Katisha's aria,
"Hearts Do Not Break" ("they only
sting and ache") from the second

aria from the same act, Miss Turner
sang with Mr. Argall, both of them
colorfully costumed, while Mr. Cor
bet! faithfully protected the Mikado
with his bespangled umbrella.
Explains Ruddigore
Mr. van Nibroc explained that
"Ruddigore" was a reaction to the
saccharine-sweet love story of the
time. The title is indicative, the
British hating the word "bloody."
Characters in the musical are Mad
Margaret, an Ophelia-like creature;
Sweet Rose May Bud, who is as the
name suggests; and Despard Murga
troyd, not only a villain but double
dyed. The plot, as explained by

demned by a witch to do a crime a
day.

Explains Ruddigore
Mr. van Nibroc explained that
"Ruddigore" was a reaction to the
saccharine-sweet love story of the
time. The title is indicative, the
British hating the word "bloody."
Characters in the musical are Mad
Margaret, an Ophelia-like creature;
Sweet Rose May Bud, who is as the
name suggests; and Despard Murga
troyd, not only a villain but double
dyed. The plot, as explained by
Mr. van Nibroc, concerned the un
happy Murgatroyd family, con
demned by a witch to do a crime a
day.
The entertainment was spon- I
sored by the Speech and Drama De
partment. Mr. van Nibroc was for
five years with the Stratford-on-
Avnn Players in England. During
that time he served as stage man- 1
ager for three summers with the
D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Here i
he learned the legends and traditions '
of these operas.
When Queen Victoria said, "We arc not amused." that was that. But
when the Japanese minister protested "The Mikado," Gilbert and Sullivan's
latest hit, Victoria reversed her decision. "This time," she said, "we are
amused." Such was the story told by Mr. Cedric van Nibroc of the Savoy
Opera Company in the Memorial Hall yesterday at 1 p.m.
