# Bandage Roilers' Attendance Good
## 
### 
Attendance at the Surgical Dress
ing Room was reasonably satisfac
tory this week, despite the fact that
girls did not regularly serve during
the hours for which they were
signed, according to Marie Wagner,
chairman of Surgical Dressings.
There is a possibility of a gauze
shortage in the near future which
may necessitate the closing of the
bandage-rolling room for two or
three days of next week.
