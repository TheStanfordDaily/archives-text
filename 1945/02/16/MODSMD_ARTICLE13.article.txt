# Indians Walk Out on Checks; Cellar May Have To Close
## 
### 
A total of $2.22 was lost by the Associated Students Wednes
day night when nine people walked out of the Cellar between
9 and 10:30 p.m. without paying their checks, according to Jim
Emerson, student manager.

Twelve students walked out Monday night, leaving $2.88 un

paid; and 10 students Tuesday night with a total
of $3.70, making the total of unpaid bills in three
nights of Cellar operation $8.80.
Lose $450 Per Year?
"At this rate, the Associated Students would
lose $150 per quarter, and $450 in a year's time,"
said Emerson. "This money comes out of the
students' pockets, as a certain amount of money
is taken from tuition and fees each quarter to
pay for it."
"Besides that, the Cellar is a students' pro
ject, and the money would have gone to pay
for the debt on the Memorial Auditorium," he

said. "The students as a whole will have to make up for it."

Carelessness Will Close Cellar
If this situation keeps on, the Cellar will have to be closed.
There are unpaid bills in the daytime but they do not add up to
nearly so much money. "It is no doubt a matter of carelessness,"
said Emerson. "We have a very efficient cashier (student) and the
student hashers are volunteering their time. We are going to put
up a sign to remind students to pay their checks before they
leave."
"It was the students that asked to have the Cellar open at
night, and it is a students' project carried on by students. There
fore, if it cannot be conducted in a respectable manner, the stu
dents will Have to take the responsibility of closing the Cellar
at night," Emerson said.
