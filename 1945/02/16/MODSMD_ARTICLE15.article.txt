### 
Lake Lagunita will officially open
Saturday at 10 a.m., following ap-
I oroval of Excoin at its meeting yes-

afternoon.
Jim Emerson,
student manager,
announces.
Hours that the
lake will be open
arc Monday
through Friday 1
p.m. to 6 p.m.,
and on Saturday
and Sunday from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Newton Arnold
has been ap
pointed as the
fourth lifeguard;

Mark Greer, Al Marquez, and Frank

! de Lisle are the other three.
Those drooling Indians who have
been taking daily jaunts to the lake
; with their 30-foot yard stick, may
1 now leave said measuring instru
| ment behind and carry instead in
their back pockets their swimming
,suits.
No Checking Facilities
Since there are no checking facili
ties at the lake, people are asked
not to bring valuables. The boat
house and grounds have been cleaned
j up for student use, and some new
] improvements have been made,
j Emerson said.
This is the second red and white
j season of the boat house, as formerly
| it was blue and white. New paint
| will come in view through the canoes, '

also, .since many of the living groups
arc repainting them this weekend
in preparation for a long boathouse
season. Most houses have their own
canoes, often owning two or three.
When wishing to take them out, they
are required to sign for them in the
office of the boathouse.
Stanford Students Only
No one except Stanford students
shall be allowed on the boathouse
deck or in Lake Lagunita, and there
shall be no swimming or canoeing
when lifeguards are not on duty.
Because of weeds and for other safe
ty reasons, there shall be no swim
ming beyond the rafts at any time.
Rules regarding canoes say that
canoes should not be overloaded and
that no non-swimmer shall be al

lowed in the canoes. Do not change
places in a canoe or boat off shore.
All living groups are warned to lock
all canoes to racks and keep their
paddles in lockers provided, be
cause the ASSU cannot be responsi
ble for the misuse of canoes that are
not kept locked. Sign with the life
guard before taking out a canoe,
and report any damage to a canoe
to him.
Observe Safety Precaution
Report injuries to any person on
the lake to the lifeguard.
It is requested that the usual health
and safety precautions be observed,
such as not swimming within an
hour after eating, and not diving
into the cold lake after lying in the
hot nun.
