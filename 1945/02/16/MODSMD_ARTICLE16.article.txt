ADMIRAL NIMITZ' HQ., Guam, Friday, Feb.
1.6 (UP).â€”More than 1200 U.S. carrier-based
aircraft in the first great sea-borne assault
against the Japanese homeland are attacking
Tokyo and its industrial environs as the climax
to the most daring foray in the history of the
American Navy. Fleet Admiral Chester W.
Nimitz disclosed that a powerful task force
under Vice-Adm. Marc A. Mitscher, master of
carrier warfare, has carried American naval
air might to the heart of the heart of the enemy's
crumbling Pacific empire.
Military targets, air bases, and Japanese air
craft are being blasted by the greatest carrier
force the world has ever seen.
A major fleet action was not believed prob
able off Japan, although Mitscher's forces were
within 300 miles of the enemy's homeland.
Hov/ever, a minor air-naval engagement might
ensue.
It was thought that Japan's naval strength is
not great enough to challenge the U.S. fleet in
battle.
