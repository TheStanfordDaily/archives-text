corner.
"Anyone on campus may enter the |
competition for the Delta Sigma Rho ;
Award, regardless of previous de- j
bating experience," said Miss New- i
ton.
The question, "Resolved, that the j
study of the history of western civili- j
zalion negates religious belief," was j
chosen by Debate Council from ques- !
tions submitted by students.
Tournament Begins Monday
The tournament, will begin next
Monday, February 19, and will ex
lend over a three weeks period till
the Awards Banquet on March 9.
Contestants and officials will attend j
the banquet at which time winners |
will be announced and awards giv- !
en. The permanent award will be !
engraved with the names of win- !
ning debaters.
Teams may enter either as individ- J
uafs or as representing living groups j
or organizations, as tho tournament
is being run on a ladder basis and I
modeled after the intra-mural sports j
events, according to Gilbert Senton. j
in charge of judges.
Speakers Persuade Audience
The nature of the question lends |
itself readily to an Oxford type of j
debate, in which stress is laid on j
(he speakers' ability to persuade the j
audience that his opinion is correct, !
rather than on presentation of fac
tual proof, according to Miss New
ton. who added that this is an ad
vantage to the contestants since it |
eliminates extensive research.
The contest, which is a revival of '
former annual Delta Siqma Rho all- I
campus tournaments, is under the i
direction of debate manager Carol !
Newton and Vicky Sellens, newly- ;
elected assistant debate manager.
