# Farm Loses One Pair of Overalls
## 
### 
Stanford's ever-ready Fire Depart
ment sent out a frantic alarm yes
terday afternoon at 5:45. Hie cam
pus heard the urgent peal of the
department's horn and wondered if
at long last those cigarettes on Quad
had done their dirty work.
Mashers who live at the fire house
ran furiously at the sound of the
alarm. They had to get back on the
job. People stared as the big red
truck swung out of the garage and
turned to the right into the cor
poration yard.
The tremendous, three-alarm fire
was squelched. No one was injured
except perhaps thr man who will
come to work this morning and find
his overalls burned.
