# FOUR WEEKS TOO LATE
## 
### 
just a casual question from a Stanfordite
deep in midterms:
"Has the system of education which bases
grading on two or three examinations through
out a quarter actually proven itself of value?"
The question arose yesterday when a friend
who had studied a certain Stanford course with
interest and endeavor walked out of class, her
hopes speared neatly by a blue exam book
marked "minus." The situation had the ring
cf a false nickel on cement. Something was
wrong, her methods of study probably, or—
we thought twice—a system which allows a
student to continue for four or five weeks, study
ing more or less independently, before an exam
shows him that his approach has been wrong
and that much of the time he's spent may be
chalked up as waste.
Assuming that the present method isn't the
best possible, let's look for a more helpful one.
Under the usual system a student discovers his
mistakes too late to ameliorate them to any ex
tent. If weekly guizzes were given, after the
first or second quiz a student would know
whether or not he was succeeding in his at
tempt to learn and understand the course. He
would have a chance to reassimilate the material
and pigeon-hole it into a comprehensive pat
tern.
Ruefully many of us must admit that our
most intensive study of a subject springs up the
night before a midterm or a final. This sad truth
envelops students in varying degrees; some
lace it with stoic unconcern, the others "froth at
the mind" until dawn. Perhaps regularity of
quizzes, each of equal importance, would bring
regularity to studying which will-power often
fails to produce.
"If I can cool an exam with a 'B' after-one
night's cramming," someone commented, "why
should I worry?"
Don't worry, then, unless you agree that
gradual and steady accumulation of knowledge
is more permanent than random impressions
dented in haste on the memory. Facts learned
by cramming have little adhesive guality and
seldom stick as part of an education.
Infrequent examinations seem to receive too
much emphasis because of their very infre
quency. We are taught by our colleagues to
dread tests, rather than calmly observe them
as mileposts of our scholastic progress. Let's
consider the possibility that a schedule of brief
weekly quizzes in each course would give us a
saner attitude toward our University work, and
eliminate long phases of inertia interspersed
with exam-hysteria.—N. S.
