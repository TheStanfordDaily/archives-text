# MINOR BIGOTRIES
## 
### 
Students of William and Mary's College last
week protested censorship by school authorities
of their newspaper, precipitated by publication
of an editorial which suggested that negroes
should attend the institution and have the right
even to marry among the students.
We at Stanford feel secure from such flam
ing bigotries. Certainly we are not censored
as was this school in the East; but, if we misuse
our trust, then we subject ourselves to a lesser
though exceedingly significant evil.
Student groups often withhold news which
they deem of a harmful nature without reflect
ing upon the vicious rumors and suspicions
that are engendered amoung the student body
by this unwise policy. Occasionally student
organizations, not realizing the significance of
their actions, have dictated to the Daily the
kind of news that they wished to have pub
lished. This has resulted in evil repercussions
and is an obvious revelation of student igno
rance of the implications of shortsighted poli
cies.
Perhaps among us a keener awareness of
American ideals and concepts should be pro
mulgated. Discussions might be organized
among student groups upon the topic, "A Bet
ter Student Government," to awaken interest
in this problem. Special classes for these
groups might be organized, which could deal
with problems of student administration.
We need to be aware of the principles that
o the heritage of free thought and discussion
that permit men to live in dignity and freedom.
