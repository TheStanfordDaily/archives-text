# Bull Session
## 
### MARY AL SMITH 
In the absence of Sessioner Smith, who is
now living in Rest Home retirement with an
acute case of mid-terms, Dr. Beetsom, noted
Murvanian scholar and Tuesday Series lecturer,
will sling today's bull.
But wait—a few thousand words from Neigh
bah Smith as they were just flown to us by a
carrier-based pigeon:
"Fellow Thunder Riders:
"Am being held here against my will. Was
it hard to get here? ... You just have to ask me. j
"I was flashing my Student Body Guard op
posite Wilson's, where I had finished ordering
the weekly cocaine rations for the Daily staff
(learn something every day, don't you?). Well,
two days passed before I got a share-the-ride
offer and that was on the Vets' Hosp. bus. What
could I lose? . . . Well, I lost it —my Student
Body Guard, of course. This Vets' Hosp. bus,
despite its innocent appearance, is not and
never was destined for a Vets' Hosp. It is, fellow
Thunder Riders, an express to the Rest Home.
"So that's how I got here . . . and here's how i
I'm getting out.
"As soon as the Rest Home sheets come back
from the laundry—and it should be any year
now—l'll be able to complete my rope ladder
from the window box to the Women's Gym.
Of course, I must be careful not to step 011 the
poppy crop in my eagerness to get to the 1
Ranch Rumpus (adv.)."
TO THE RESCUE
And now Dr. Beetsom:
Only a matter of the greatest importance >
could drag me from my laboratory atop the
Hoover War Libe where I am working on a i
formula for synthetic reeb (forward it speels
reeb). Ever since the announcement of the
all-campus assembly on Tuesday morning,
Cellar Time, rumor has been rocking the Farm.
I feel it my duty as a member in good standing
of the Stanford Family to expose these rumor
spreaders—and also to spread a few of my own.
Of the many reasons for calling the assembly,
most possible are the following:
1. It may be an unscheduled meeting of the
Thunder Riders. Now that Gene Autry is do
ing his ledge-leaping exercises in cars with
loose brakes, the Thunder Rider syllabus will
have to be revised. The assembly would be
an immense aid in co-ordinating the views of
faculty and student leaders on ledge-leaping
and similar activities.
2. At the assembly, new technigues of "foot
sie" playing may be demonstrated. It is about
time something more lucid about methods of
playing "footsie" were offered to its Farm fans.
3. The assembly may be meeting to take a
campus poll on whether or not to change the
time of Folk Dancing TThF at 8 a.m.
4. The assembly may undertake to abolish
all quizzes. Though if student factions are op
posed, a compromise may be reached by the
abolishment of all classes. Having lived for so
many years . . . twenty . . . thirty . . . forty . . . j
fifty ... a helluva lot of years in the under
ground kingdom of Murvania, I intend to pass
over the wealth of my experience to students
who come to the assembly.
5. No matter what the main part of the as- |
sembly is about, it is fairly certain that a warn
ing will be given to all campus to beware of
the Vets' Hosp. vehicle. You never can tell . . . I
TO THE RESCUE.
