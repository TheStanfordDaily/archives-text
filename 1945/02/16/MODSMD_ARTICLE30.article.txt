In my youth the practitioners of Science were fig- |
ures little known and less understood. The mind of j
the layman presented with the abstruse notions of j
Science rejected them with horror as too difficult of
comprehension, although his natural curiosity in
creased immeasurably the more it was thwarted.
Advances in Science itseif put an end to this im- |
passe. Today all members of society share with the j
specialist in the joy of discovery and in appreciation of
research workers. In this respect we are back to the
conditions that existed so happily in the eighteenth
century, when the volumes of the Philosophical Trans
actions, the greatest research journal of its time, were
reviewed annually in the literary magazines by intel
ligent laymen, such as Dr. Samuel Johnson.
It is not perhaps too clear to us today how this !
transformation has taken place. But as one reflects |
upon the social history of the past half-century it be
comes clear that one invention in particular has been
responsible. This is the Electron Microscope, small
versions of which are today playthings in the hands of
our children, but which in 1945 was an enormous in
strument of impressive appearance, valued at about
$12 000.
The Electron Microscope in the early 'fifties be- J
came so improved that it was possible actually to see
atoms and molecules, or at least if not to see them, to j
see something that seemed to be atoms and molecules.
Modern theory tells us that you cannot see a molecule, 1
but only the effect that the molecule has; but this is |
mere word quibbling, for of course you cannot see any
thing at all but only the effect that the object has on
a beam of li^ht.
The important thing is that immediately most of
the i<l ly difficult part of Science disappeared. The
difficulties of Science turned out to be man-made, i
-They consisted of inspired guesses, intuitive thrusts
into the dark, developed with all the ingenuity of
mathematics and formal logic.
As soon as the modern Electron Microscope an
swered all questions definitivly about the atom, guesses
and theories were no longer requited and a host of '
ingenuities, paradoxes, mathematical puzzles and un- j
thinkable concepts were thrown out.
The common man found it possible at last to under
stand what the scientist was talking about, with pro
found benefits to both parties.—The Walrus

In my youth the practitioners of Science were fig- |
ures little known and less understood. The mind of j
the layman presented with the abstruse notions of j
Science rejected them with horror as too difficult of
comprehension, although his natural curiosity in
creased immeasurably the more it was thwarted.
Advances in Science itseif put an end to this im- |
passe. Today all members of society share with the j
specialist in the joy of discovery and in appreciation of
research workers. In this respect we are back to the
conditions that existed so happily in the eighteenth
century, when the volumes of the Philosophical Trans
actions, the greatest research journal of its time, were
reviewed annually in the literary magazines by intel
ligent laymen, such as Dr. Samuel Johnson.
It is not perhaps too clear to us today how this !
transformation has taken place. But as one reflects |
upon the social history of the past half-century it be
comes clear that one invention in particular has been
responsible. This is the Electron Microscope, small
versions of which are today playthings in the hands of
our children, but which in 1945 was an enormous in
strument of impressive appearance, valued at about
$12 000.
The Electron Microscope in the early 'fifties be- J
came so improved that it was possible actually to see
atoms and molecules, or at least if not to see them, to j
see something that seemed to be atoms and molecules.
Modern theory tells us that you cannot see a molecule, 1
but only the effect that the molecule has; but this is |
mere word quibbling, for of course you cannot see any
thing at all but only the effect that the object has on
a beam of li^ht.
The important thing is that immediately most of
the i<l ly difficult part of Science disappeared. The
difficulties of Science turned out to be man-made, i
-They consisted of inspired guesses, intuitive thrusts
into the dark, developed with all the ingenuity of
mathematics and formal logic.
As soon as the modern Electron Microscope an
swered all questions definitivly about the atom, guesses
and theories were no longer requited and a host of '
ingenuities, paradoxes, mathematical puzzles and un- j
thinkable concepts were thrown out.
The common man found it possible at last to under
stand what the scientist was talking about, with pro
found benefits to both parties.—The Walrus
