Coming to Stanford gave K5 of us
front Camp Blandiug (he opportunity
of a lifetime—a train ride with Gus
the I'ullman Porter. It all started one
Friday evening in December on plat
form four in the Jacksonville Florida
train station. A man of medium
build, with a broad smile, walked
over to us as we were struggling with
our baggage and proudly announced
that he was (Jus, our Pullman porter.
Someone asked where to put the
baggage cart and Gun promptly
answered, "You should know that,
young man." We were to hear him
repeat that phrase many times.
It turned out that we were the
only ones assigned to the troop
sleeper; Gus could devote all his
time and energies to us. He had been
told our names several times, but
he addressed each of us as "young
man," in fact, anyone this side of
the grave was still a "young man."
Our porter never ceased to amaze us
with the vast amount of information
he had accumulated on geography,
history and literature. His favorite
pastime, when the dice weren't
rolling, was to quiz us on any topic
under the sun. The correct answer
to his question always caused him
to exclaim, "You said the word,
young man!" When we corldn't solve 1
his problems, he would say, "You
should know that, young man."
During the course of our five-day
trip we made several stops and (Jus
always wanted us to look our best
in public. lie had us line up before
him in the best prescribed military
manner and undergo a rigid inspec
tion. Only those who passed could
leave the train. He certainly kept
us on the ball.
As we got closer to California and
Palo Alto, we started questioning
Gus about Stanford. This was where
he shone; he was better than any
Chamber fo Commerce could ever
hope to be. In answer to the question
how soldiers were treated in Palo
Alto, he would proclaim, "Everything
free for the servicemen!" He sym
pathized with us buck privates and
promised, "Automatic Pfc. when you
get there." Needless to say, he con
sidered all Stanford co-eds Holly
wood beauties and predicted the !
ratio of four or five women to every
man. There was no end to his praise
of Stanford. We were headed towards
a veritable paradise.
Now that we arc at Stanford, still
buck privates and paying for every
thing we buy, we realize how much
Gus liked to exaggerate. However,
we agree on one point, "You said the !
word, young man."

Has anyone found the bell of a
baritone horn lost, by coincidence,
just before band drill last Satur
day? It should be easy to find since

its owner reports the horn was about
a ton lighter without the bell.

An investigation is under way to
determine scientifically and statis
tically v r hat the odds are against
crossing "Killers' Lane" without an
accident. If you have crossed Lasuen
street a dozen times in a row with
out a close escape from a speeding
bicycle, please report il to this col
umn—you are a rare specimen.

Saturday afternoon came early last
week. The ball-and-chains were all
put away for a short time, and the
"boys," wearing their snappiest fa
tigues and rifles, set off on a little
hike. Blackball muttered dire pre
dictions about this being the long
awaited trip to the salt mines. As
the line of condemned men staggered
off into the distance, the populace
showered them with little gifts
(oranges in various stages of ripe
ness). Their heroes reappeared hours
later, horribly emaciated, marching
in an exagerated "Montana" cadence.
After they returned to the barracks,
the tired little wayfarers began to
examine the huge blisters which
covered their feet. Few of them could
talk. Only Louis the Dorque seemed
normal. When asked how he felt, he
smiled, "I wish I were dead."
Oh for another road march!

Does your girl love the "finer"
things? Does she pine away her
Friday evenings? Why not bring her
to Baldacci's Friday night jam ses
sions, in the luxurious Enc in a
Lounge?

Spring fever has some fellows in
its clutches, so that they can't do
what they're supposed to do because
they're thinking about what they'd
like to do.
