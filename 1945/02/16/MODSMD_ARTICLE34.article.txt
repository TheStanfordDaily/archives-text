Born in Tennessee around 1895,
Bessie Smith was to become the most
famous blues singer in the coun
try. Bessie was discovered many
times and one of these discoveries
was said to have pulled the Colum
bia record company out of the red.
j But the most important of these was
j Ma Kainey's discovery of Bessie at
i the age of 12. Ma Raincy, herself a
| famous singer, trained Bessie and
taught her the style which made her
1 famous.
During the period between 1922 I
and 1927 Bessie's records sold over

4,000,000 copies, j
These recordsi
combined wit h |
personal appear- j
ance, tours made i
Bessie known to
both white and '
colored audiences

| and gave jazz one of its greatest im
j petuses.
Bessie was able to express all the
j human emotions in her singing of
j the blues. There is humor in i
"You've Been a Good Old Wagon," I
! a challenge in "Young Woman's
Blues," and sadness in "Muddy Wa
! tcr."
Bessie died in 1937 as the result of
an automobile accident. Some people
claim that Bessie was left by the
doctors until it was too late, because
she was colored. Whether this is true
or not, when Bessie died, the world
j lost one of its greatest blues singers.
