## Bower Bows Before Bacall! 
### 
Warner Brothers' story of rum, ro
mance. and rebellion, "TO HAVE
AND HAVE NOT." has moved to the
Varsity Theatre where all good

Stanforditcs are
flocking to see
Miss Lauren Ba
ca 1 1 an d her
"c om e hither"
look. Everybody
from Joe Sher
on up seems to
be enjoying this
turbulent storv
of Martinique, its
politics, women,
and bars.

Humphrey Bogart shares top hon
ors with Miss Bacall and the dia
logue between the pair carries a
double meaning a good part of the
time. Also in the cast are Walter
Brennan, one of Acme's best cus
tomers, and Hoagy Carmichael,
playing nostalgic melodies on his
piano whenever the occasion de
mands.

You'll probably enjoy "To Have
and Have Not," for, as Miss Lita
Warner said in an exclusive inter
view granted your reviewer, "It will
help each Stanford student to ac
quire a really libetral education."
The Stanford Theatre is currently
showing "An American Romance,"i
a story of an impoverished immi-"
grant (Brian Donlevy) who rises to
become an industrial magnate.
M-G-M stock fell five points after
this thing was released and we can
easily understand why.
Also at the Stanford is "Army
Wives," an insincere attempt at de
picting the lives of some war brides,
chief among them EJyse Knox (Mrs.
Tommy Harmon). We'll bet that
Tommy had some bitter words with
his bride after seeing this "comedy."
