# Andriano Heads Reserve Room
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
went to Rome where she studied <
and did nursery school and pre- !
school work. After returning to the
United States, she taught nursery
school for a while in Los Altos.
Studied Child Psychology
She went abroad alone. While
there she met Dr. Maria Montessori,
one of the earliest doctors to be in
terested in child psychology, and
studied with her personally for sev
eral months.
"I decided 1 needed a rest, so
when the opportunity came for me
to work at Stanford. I took it," Miss
Andriano said. "Boys took charge
of the Reserve Book Room for the
most part before the war, and they
were the ones who introduced me
to the work. When they come back,
I'll give the work back to them."
Enjoys Work
Miss Andriano works in the Book
Room from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. three
days a week, and from 8:30 to 6 two
days a week. She has been at Stan
ford two years. "I enjoy the work
very, very much," she said. "It is
interesting to handle lots of books
and get acquainted with authors,
titles, and the assignments the stu
dents have. I get so interested that
I find myself reading most of the
assignments."
Miss Andriano's, plans for the fu
ture are indefinite. She intends to
work with little children again, and
hopes to go to Europe again. "I
would like to carry my studies of
children from the birth age to>about
three years of age," she said. "Also,
in my child psychology work, I am
especially intrested in unusual chil
drenâ€”geniuses or those who are
mentally deficient."
Lived in London
Miss Andriano's home is in Los
Altos and she lives there now. She
has never attended any classes at
Stanford, but used to come here be
fore the war to educational con
ferences in the summer time.
She likes to play tennis and swim.
Tennis was the popular game in
London when she was in school
there, and was the favorite game of
the girls.
"My athletic interests are in the
productive line now." she said. She
is especially interested in fruit
farming. She likes to work in or
chards and harvest fruit.
Students More Serious Now
"The main difference between
Stanford now and before the war

Miss Edna Andriano, in charge of the Reserve Book Room in the d;iy
time, is interested primarily in nursery school and pre-school education,
and has studied several years abroad.
She attended San Jose State College for three years, and then was
graduated from the Teachers College in London in 1935. From there she

as far as the Reserve Book Room
is concerned is that the students
seem so much more serious now.
Before the war, students took things
much more lightly and seemed to
have much more fun."
Miss Andriano thinks her child
psychology helps her with Stanford
students. "It has taught me pa
tience and tolerance which I can
| use on adult students," she said.
Fines Cause Trouble
"The main trouble I have is argu
-1 ing over the lines in the Book Room.
| I have this trouble far too often and
I it hurts me more to have to charge
I fines than it hurts the students to
pay them.
"Tl.e first thing I do each morn
ing when I get here is read the Daily
S from top to bottom. I can't give out
! any books until I've read it com
| pletely."
Her main advice to students is not
j to wait until the 11th hour to get
I assignments. There are never enough
I books to go around then.
