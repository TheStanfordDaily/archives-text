# SIDELINE SLANTS...

This is one column that we hate
to write, but we feel it necessary. It
seems that the rumors have been
flying around like they have never
been flying around before. Wherever
we go, fellows and gals ask us the
sixty-four dollar question: Is Stan
ford going to resume football in
1C45? Truthfully, we don't know.
The only thing we do know is that
unless there is some radical change
somewhere along the line, Stanford
will not put out a team this year.
20th
It seems that there has been a
little too much "withholding" public
ity about the big meeting on the
20th, and naturally everyone has be
gun to think about it and wonder
what it is all about. This wondering,
coupled with a column of Bill
Leiser's, Chronicle sports editor, was
just enough to start the rumor ma
chine going. The other day Leiser
wrote that the Navy was going to
open some more programs and com
mission about 30 universities, among
which would be Stanford. This would
mean that there would be Navy stu
dents at Stanford who could partici
pate in inter-collegiate sports. The
only remaining conclusion to take is
that if Stanford would want to save
its name, it would have to field a
team. However, as Leiser said in his
column, this is only a rumor also.
So when we heard about this big
meeting, with President Tresidder
speaking, and read Bill Leiser's col
umn, all of us figured that that was
the big news.
Sports Not Concerned
Well, to stop that rumor before it
gets out of hand, the meeting has
nothing to do with future sports at
Stanford. That hurts us as much as
it hurts anyone else. For a while
our hopes were higher than they
had ever been before, but now we
arc again sinking into our little hide
aways that we cover over with old
sports pages.
It looks like intra-mural sports
will be the big news for a while to
come, not that that isn't good news.
We would venture to say that the
Phi Psi-Beta game of last Tuesday
night was as good a basketball game
as the coast has seen all year. And
this Tyler-Chinese Club affair to
night will also be okay.
Independents
For those who are still bemoaning
the condition of the Farm and stuff
like that there, we offer this one
solution to their problems: there are
always the Independents. We can't
say enough about them, for they have
been doing great work, considering
the practice that they don't get. They
are entered in the Northern Cali
fornia Basketball Association which
puts on games every week at Kezar
Pavillion in San Francisco, and have
become one of the most feared teams
in the league. This is really going
some, as most of the top teams in
the Bay Area are entered in the
association. By the way, they are
playing a game this Sunday against
the Olympic Club. Hope to see you
there.
