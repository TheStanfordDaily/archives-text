# Barbara White Judges Farm's Postwar Policies
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
(I.ditoi ial note: I his is the first in a series of articles on Stanford's
postwar outlook.
During the past few months, the Daily has heen presenting worldwide
postwar problems, and at last the time has come to ask what will happen
at our own University.
Student leaders and ofTiciers have been watching Stanford change,
and we will attempt to interview them on what they like most and least
in the present setup, what they hop*? will be added or changed, and
their predictions of Stanford's future.)

"Stanford's governmental setup
must be changed," said Barbara
White, A.S.S.U. president. "The
present system is too indirect. . Ex
com does not really represent the
students."
This is partially the fault of a
wartime system, the Emergency
Guide Plan, which has temporarily
replaced the Stanford constitution.
Under this plan Excom was made
smaller and more powerful than be
fore, but also less representative.
This wartime plan has been useful;
it eliminated a great deal of red
tape. But it was not meant to be
permanent.

the two groups then go to Excom
with these student opinions. But
Excom cannot fully utilize this
source of opinion and does not even
give these two presidents a vote.
Many of the student suggestions are
lost along the way.
"Women's Conference and Men's
Inter-Hall Council should be stim
ulated and given voting power. They
could then search for student opin
ion and use it," said Miss White.
Honor Code
Best part of Stanford today is the
Honor Code as it applies to aca
demic studies, she feels. But there is
some confusion as to how far it
applies outside our academic life,
which should be clarified for the
students.
Worst part of present-day Stan
ford is the"I don't care" attitude
of many students, said Miss White.
Too many have lost interesfand are
blaming it on the change in our
living system. They have ceased to

Now Stanford is becoming ad
justed to wartime, and a committee
is bringing the constitution up to
date. It is expected to be ready for
use by next year.
Weakness
Miss White showed how the pres
ent system is weak, and what she
hopes most to have changed.
Living groups take their com
plaints and suggestions to Women's
Conference and Men's Inter-Hall
Council, where they are brought up
and discussed. The presidents of

contribute and only exist. This atti
tude can be changed, she feels; in
deed. it has improved greatly during
the past few weeks.
Her most definite and encouraging
prediction for the future was that
of a new Stanford Union, with bet
ter facilities of every kind. It is ex
pected to fill a good many of our
entertainment and housing needs.
It can bp a central lounging place
where we will gather for large ban
quets and friendly Saturday nights.
It may even give the faculty a place
to live for those who want to be
near the Quad." A place such as
this would encourage the all-cam
pus get-togethers that we now have
only at dances and occasional as
semblies," concluded Miss White.

BARBARA WHITE . . . gave
opinions on post-war politics.
(I.ditoi ial note: I his is the first in a series of articles on Stanford's
postwar outlook.
During the past few months, the Daily has heen presenting worldwide
postwar problems, and at last the time has come to ask what will happen
at our own University.
Student leaders and ofTiciers have been watching Stanford change,
and we will attempt to interview them on what they like most and least
in the present setup, what they hop*? will be added or changed, and
their predictions of Stanford's future.)

"Stanford's governmental setup
must be changed," said Barbara
White, A.S.S.U. president. "The
present system is too indirect. . Ex
com does not really represent the
students."
This is partially the fault of a
wartime system, the Emergency
Guide Plan, which has temporarily
replaced the Stanford constitution.
Under this plan Excom was made
smaller and more powerful than be
fore, but also less representative.
This wartime plan has been useful;
it eliminated a great deal of red
tape. But it was not meant to be
permanent.

the two groups then go to Excom
with these student opinions. But
Excom cannot fully utilize this
source of opinion and does not even
give these two presidents a vote.
Many of the student suggestions are
lost along the way.
"Women's Conference and Men's
Inter-Hall Council should be stim
ulated and given voting power. They
could then search for student opin
ion and use it," said Miss White.
Honor Code
Best part of Stanford today is the
Honor Code as it applies to aca
demic studies, she feels. But there is
some confusion as to how far it
applies outside our academic life,
which should be clarified for the
students.
Worst part of present-day Stan
ford is the"I don't care" attitude
of many students, said Miss White.
Too many have lost interesfand are
blaming it on the change in our
living system. They have ceased to

Now Stanford is becoming ad
justed to wartime, and a committee
is bringing the constitution up to
date. It is expected to be ready for
use by next year.
Weakness
Miss White showed how the pres
ent system is weak, and what she
hopes most to have changed.
Living groups take their com
plaints and suggestions to Women's
Conference and Men's Inter-Hall
Council, where they are brought up
and discussed. The presidents of

contribute and only exist. This atti
tude can be changed, she feels; in
deed. it has improved greatly during
the past few weeks.
Her most definite and encouraging
prediction for the future was that
of a new Stanford Union, with bet
ter facilities of every kind. It is ex
pected to fill a good many of our
entertainment and housing needs.
It can bp a central lounging place
where we will gather for large ban
quets and friendly Saturday nights.
It may even give the faculty a place
to live for those who want to be
near the Quad." A place such as
this would encourage the all-cam
pus get-togethers that we now have
only at dances and occasional as
semblies," concluded Miss White.
