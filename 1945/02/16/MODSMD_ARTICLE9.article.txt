# Chinese Club Defeats Tyler
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
With only 25 seconds remaining in
the game, Larry Corley sank a sen
sational one-handed push shot to
give Med. II a 15)-17 win over the
Grizzlies, an Army squad. The con
test was slow throughout, the half
lime score being 9-6 in favor of the
Grizzlies.
It was Ed Moss, center for the
Meds that kept them in the game the
second half, for he sunk four buckets
to bring hi.s total to 10 for the eve
ning. The Grizzlies led all the way,
until the closing moments, when
Corley's shot copped the honors for
the Meds.
This triumph gives the victors a
record of two wins awl one defeat.
After losing to the Legal Eagles,
their arch rivals, 17-16, they came
back to trounce Gerona last week
and edge out their rivals this week.
In Encina Gym. Tyler Mali lost
its second contest in a row to the
rapidly improving Chinese Club by
a score of 10-12. The splendid back
hoard work of Baron Lowe, former
Sacramento casahaman. and the gen
eral ineffectiveness of the Tyler
men's shots, all added up to give the
"Club" an easy win.
High scoring honors went to Lowe,
Fauny Ho, and Wu with four points
apiece.
Although impressive in pre-sea
son encounters, Tyler has slumped

considerably, because of the loss of
Tom Egan, who has left for the j
Navy. There seems to be a lid on |
the basket for the "Hilltoppers," who |
have only scored 8 points in the I
second halves of their last two
games.
In the 8:15 contests, the Legal
Eagles walloped Gcrona A.C. 3f»-2:5
in the highest scoring game of the
evening. As usual the Lawyers edge
in height was too much for their !
opponents, and "Heinic" Harlwell
used his height to his advantage and ,
swished through 1(> digits to take
top scoring honors for the victors, j
"Handsome" Ken Ilushy also con- J
trihuted to the Legal Eagle cause i
with 8 points to his credit. Parker
Reische and Johnny Burris led the
losers with fl and (i points, respec
tive^.
This win put the Eagles in the
top spot in the Lagunita League with
three wins and no defeats, leaving
only the Chinese Club as serious j
contenders for the crown.
In the Pavilion, the Strangers ran
away in the second half to top the j
Arguello Whites 31-10. Bruce Bart- j
lett and Burke were hot for the |
victors, each contributing 10 digits !
to 'lis .earns total.
Il was a heated tussle throughout
with the two squads almost coming

give Med. II a 15)-17 win over the
Grizzlies, an Army squad. The con
test was slow throughout, the half
lime score being 9-6 in favor of the
Grizzlies.
It was Ed Moss, center for the
Meds that kept them in the game the
second half, for he sunk four buckets
to bring hi.s total to 10 for the eve
ning. The Grizzlies led all the way,
until the closing moments, when
Corley's shot copped the honors for

In Encina Gym. Tyler Mali lost
its second contest in a row to the
rapidly improving Chinese Club by
a score of 10-12. The splendid back
hoard work of Baron Lowe, former
Sacramento casahaman. and the gen
eral ineffectiveness of the Tyler
men's shots, all added up to give the
"Club" an easy win.
High scoring honors went to Lowe,
Fauny Ho, and Wu with four points
apiece.
Although impressive in pre-sea
son encounters, Tyler has slumped

considerably, because of the loss of
Tom Egan, who has left for the j
Navy. There seems to be a lid on |
the basket for the "Hilltoppers," who |
have only scored 8 points in the I
second halves of their last two
games.
In the 8:15 contests, the Legal
Eagles walloped Gcrona A.C. 3f»-2:5
in the highest scoring game of the

used his height to his advantage and ,
swished through 1(> digits to take
top scoring honors for the victors, j
"Handsome" Ken Ilushy also con- J
trihuted to the Legal Eagle cause i
with 8 points to his credit. Parker
Reische and Johnny Burris led the
losers with fl and (i points, respec
tive^.
This win put the Eagles in the
top spot in the Lagunita League with
three wins and no defeats, leaving
only the Chinese Club as serious j
contenders for the crown.
In the Pavilion, the Strangers ran
away in the second half to top the j
Arguello Whites 31-10. Bruce Bart- j
lett and Burke were hot for the |
victors, each contributing 10 digits !
to 'lis .earns total.
Il was a heated tussle throughout
with the two squads almost coming
to blows in the closing moments of t
the contest.
With only 25 seconds remaining in
the game, Larry Corley sank a sen
sational one-handed push shot to
give Med. II a 15)-17 win over the
