# Jap Problems Are Discussed At 'Y' Lecture
## 
### 
Miss Motoko Hirose, instructor in
the CATS program, in speaking on
"Your Attitude Toward the Return
ing Nisei and Issei" Thursday at the
initial YWCA Race Relations lecture,
pointed out that the problem of re
distributing people of Japanese an
cestory will be largely one of their
fear.
"Probably the two major fears of
returning Japanese are the insecuri
ties of jobs and housing. Older Japa
nese-Americans were forced to give
up their businesses when they were
evacuated, and most of the younger
ones are inexperienced. It would be
tragic if these people were forced to
accept household work and other
jobs where their education and
ability would be wasted," said Miss
Hirose.
Problem Concerns Us
She added that this problem defi
nitely concerns Cal if o rnia n s.
"Though some of the Nisei have set
tled in the Middle West and plan
to remain there after the war, the
majority will want to return to the
coast, and particularly to California.
Many of them aren't accustomed to
the severe mid-western weather and
feel that California is their home."
Stanford's Role
She pointed out that Stanford will
have a role in this program also. "In
peace-time Japanese students served
more or less as ambassadors of good
will for the Far East. They will be
coming back to the colleges and uni
versities and should be encouraged
to do so. Students within the schools
will simplify the reabsorption sit
uation immensely by adopting a lib
eral view of the problem and spread
ing this doctrine through writing and
speaking."
Miss Hirose admitted that the task
of readjusting 120,000 Japanese
seems hopeless at the present time.
"However," she said, "through grad
ual adjustment and acceptance over
a long period of time, a solution
seems possible."
