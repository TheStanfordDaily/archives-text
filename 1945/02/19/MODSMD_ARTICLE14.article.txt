# OUT OF THE CLOSET
## 
### 
So you have an idea that will solve all prob
lems of women's housing, an idea that will fairly
polish the gold of Stanford hearts. If you admit
that you do have ideas cherished in secrecy
these past months, you might bring them forth
at the second meeting of the women's Housing
Committee today at 4 in the Excom room.
Members of this committee tell us that they
object to slipping into the customary stagnant
state of committee life, and that they want to
hear sincere student opinions concerning the
housing problem. The Stanford Daily, being as
fond of the free speech theory as of the practice
of a free press, applauds them in this.
To Stanford women we recommend a guick
clutch at an opportunity to work out a practical
system for campus living groups. Free speech
should be taken out of the dusty closet of apathy
and aired awhile as we search for a satisfactory
solution.â€”N. S.
