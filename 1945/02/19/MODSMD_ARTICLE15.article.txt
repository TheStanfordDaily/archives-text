# THE 						20TH-JUST FOR FUN
## 
### 
Have you noticed the various cartoons in The
Daily lately- Or the little stories about things
that have been going on at Stanford ever since
it was founded
They have all been leading up to the all
campus assembly on the 20th.
Assemblies have always been fun and a good
way to get together, to show some spirit by
singing Stanford songs and giving out with
Â»me yells, and to meet our University Presi
dent, student-body president, and faculty out
side of class. We have always come away feel
ing that we have had a really good time and
that belonging to Stanford is something to be
proud of.
We haven't had an assembly since last spring
quarter; the freshmen have never been to one
here. Feeling that it was about time for an as
sembly and that there should be more of them
was Cardinals' reason for the assembly on the
20th. They chose a subject which should be of
ur.portance to every member of the Stanford
Family.
It's too bad that this occasion planned for
m enjoyable student get-together and to arouse
he somewhat defunct Stanford spirit was mis
.nterpreted hy some to reveal can! shaking
news. Carol Hurwitz.
