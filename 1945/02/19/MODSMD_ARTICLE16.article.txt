One of the most significant products of the Yalta
Conference was the announcement of the coming talks
in San Francisco, which—and this is the joker—are to
be held on the same date as the Russo-Japanese non
aggression pact expires.
Coupled with this comes the announcement of the
militant but ineffective Chinese Communist party that
it will accept Chaing-Kai-Chek as a "leader, but not
as a dictator."
Kusso-Jap War
The slightly growing cohesion between Russia and
China, and the obvious diplomatic slap in Japan's face,
might indicate that the Soviet Union will join the battle
in the Far East. This will certainly help settle affairs in
China, since it will be a lot easier to bring the
enemy to a decisive battle by an advance all along
the line of the Siberian frontier, than it will be to
fightour way out of a narrow beachhead on the
China coast.
So, since the Russo-Jap war is a definite possi
bility, it is certainly advisable to discuss the
strategic aspects in advance.
Jap Problem
The Japanese dilemma lies in the geography of North"
ern China. China and the Mongolian and Manchurian
dependencies, are separated from Siberia by a rugged
line of mountains running east west. South of this
the country is divided into three sectors. First, there
is the broken terrain of Sinkiang Province, a good
prize for Russia if she could net it in a peace treaty
because of yet-untapped oil resources. West of Einkiang
is the flat, arid, Gobi Desert, an excellent ground for
warfare of the North African variety, and between the
Gobi Desert and the sea, the rich and well-developed
province of Manchuria.
This belt of land is bounded on the south by another
line of mountains, and by the famous Great Wall, and.
on its coastal side, the belt funnels into the Korean
Peninsula, the gulf between it and Japan being the only
way by which the enemy can keep contact between
his home islands and China without exposing his ship
ping lanes to American naval superiority.
Now, the Japanese can do two things. Either they
can retire behind the southern mountain belt or else
they can risk a tank battle on the flat lands of the
Gobi Desert. If they accept the former alternative,
they give up contact with Japan proper, while, if they
try the latter, they would probably find their whole
army cut to pieces.
Armored Strength
The Japanese armor is definitely inferior to anything
the Russians have, and this would decide any battle,
say, in the Gobi Desert. Japanese tanks were designed
for jungle warfare, where lightness and mobility are
the chief points to be desired. Thus, their armored
columns would be undergunned by the gigantic Russian
Stalin Tanks, and would certainly not stand up against
the blasts of Red 75 mm. tank cannons, to which they
could only reply with 37 mm. guns or worse.
Also, the Japanese cannot try to hold the Russians
behind the Siberian frontier mountains, because the
Russians are already beyond them. Outer "Mongolia,
part of the belt, is recognized as a Russian dependency.
Other Factors
It is thus not improbable that if Russia should attack
Japan, the former's armies would make great gains at
first. But the fact remains that the war would be very
difficult because of two factors.
1. Russia is nowhere near the power in the Pacific
that she is in Europe.
2. Before Russia could invade Southern China, she
would have to go through many mountain ranges where
her armored superiority would be decreased in im
portance as a strategic factor.
The reason that Russia would not be such a strong
force in the East is that Siberia is yet incapable of
supporting a gigantic army, and thus the supplies for
a Russian offensive would have to be railed across the
two Trans-Siberian Lines. Still, after they got to the
front, they would have to be taken down over the
narrow, winding roads that lead into the Mongolian-
Manchurian-Sinkiang belt, and this would cause a
terrific supply problem. Thus the full force of the Red
Army could not be used in a Japanese war, no matter
how much Marshal Stalin would want to employ it.
Secondly is the question of the mountain ranges. The
Red Army was not designed for mountain fighting, but
lor battles ol vast plains and steppes. The only mountain
barrier it came up against in this war has been the
Carpathians, and this was turned by a breathrough at
the Galati Gap. between the mountains and the sea.
Ihe line was not forced until the Germans were so
weak (hat they couldn't hold it.
The lumbering Stalin Tanks would probably find
themselves in trouble climbing the precipitious heights
ol C hina, and the extremely mobile Japanese 37 mm.
rapid-fire anti-tank gun could cause havoc.
Thus the big question of quick victory or a long
campaign in China lies in how fast the Japanese can
shift enough materials to the continent of Asia to sup
port an army there, independent of Japan's home
less to them, since it could be conquered easily. But
islands. Manchurian industry would probably be use-
Japan will be cut off from China, and vice versa,
whether the Japs like it or not. and thus will come the
question, can the Japanese keep an army going in
( hina without the bene!it of Japanese home pro
d uction?

warfare of the North African variety, and between the
Gobi Desert and the sea, the rich and well-developed
province of Manchuria.
This belt of land is bounded on the south by another
line of mountains, and by the famous Great Wall, and.
on its coastal side, the belt funnels into the Korean
Peninsula, the gulf between it and Japan being the only
way by which the enemy can keep contact between
his home islands and China without exposing his ship
ping lanes to American naval superiority.
Now, the Japanese can do two things. Either they
can retire behind the southern mountain belt or else
they can risk a tank battle on the flat lands of the
Gobi Desert. If they accept the former alternative,
they give up contact with Japan proper, while, if they
try the latter, they would probably find their whole
army cut to pieces.
Armored Strength
The Japanese armor is definitely inferior to anything
the Russians have, and this would decide any battle,
say, in the Gobi Desert. Japanese tanks were designed
for jungle warfare, where lightness and mobility are
the chief points to be desired. Thus, their armored
columns would be undergunned by the gigantic Russian
Stalin Tanks, and would certainly not stand up against
the blasts of Red 75 mm. tank cannons, to which they
could only reply with 37 mm. guns or worse.
Also, the Japanese cannot try to hold the Russians
behind the Siberian frontier mountains, because the
Russians are already beyond them. Outer "Mongolia,
part of the belt, is recognized as a Russian dependency.
Other Factors
It is thus not improbable that if Russia should attack
Japan, the former's armies would make great gains at
first. But the fact remains that the war would be very
difficult because of two factors.
1. Russia is nowhere near the power in the Pacific
that she is in Europe.
2. Before Russia could invade Southern China, she
would have to go through many mountain ranges where
her armored superiority would be decreased in im
portance as a strategic factor.
The reason that Russia would not be such a strong
force in the East is that Siberia is yet incapable of
supporting a gigantic army, and thus the supplies for
a Russian offensive would have to be railed across the
two Trans-Siberian Lines. Still, after they got to the
front, they would have to be taken down over the
narrow, winding roads that lead into the Mongolian-
Manchurian-Sinkiang belt, and this would cause a
terrific supply problem. Thus the full force of the Red
Army could not be used in a Japanese war, no matter
how much Marshal Stalin would want to employ it.
Secondly is the question of the mountain ranges. The
Red Army was not designed for mountain fighting, but
lor battles ol vast plains and steppes. The only mountain
barrier it came up against in this war has been the
Carpathians, and this was turned by a breathrough at
the Galati Gap. between the mountains and the sea.
Ihe line was not forced until the Germans were so
weak (hat they couldn't hold it.
The lumbering Stalin Tanks would probably find
themselves in trouble climbing the precipitious heights
ol C hina, and the extremely mobile Japanese 37 mm.
rapid-fire anti-tank gun could cause havoc.
Thus the big question of quick victory or a long
campaign in China lies in how fast the Japanese can
shift enough materials to the continent of Asia to sup
port an army there, independent of Japan's home
less to them, since it could be conquered easily. But
islands. Manchurian industry would probably be use-
Japan will be cut off from China, and vice versa,
whether the Japs like it or not. and thus will come the
question, can the Japanese keep an army going in
( hina without the bene!it of Japanese home pro
d uction?
One of the most significant products of the Yalta
Conference was the announcement of the coming talks
in San Francisco, which—and this is the joker—are to
be held on the same date as the Russo-Japanese non
aggression pact expires.
Coupled with this comes the announcement of the
militant but ineffective Chinese Communist party that
it will accept Chaing-Kai-Chek as a "leader, but not
as a dictator."
Kusso-Jap War
The slightly growing cohesion between Russia and
China, and the obvious diplomatic slap in Japan's face,
might indicate that the Soviet Union will join the battle
in the Far East. This will certainly help settle affairs in
China, since it will be a lot easier to bring the
enemy to a decisive battle by an advance all along
the line of the Siberian frontier, than it will be to
fightour way out of a narrow beachhead on the
China coast.
So, since the Russo-Jap war is a definite possi
bility, it is certainly advisable to discuss the
strategic aspects in advance.
Jap Problem
The Japanese dilemma lies in the geography of North"
ern China. China and the Mongolian and Manchurian
dependencies, are separated from Siberia by a rugged
line of mountains running east west. South of this
the country is divided into three sectors. First, there
is the broken terrain of Sinkiang Province, a good
prize for Russia if she could net it in a peace treaty
because of yet-untapped oil resources. West of Einkiang
is the flat, arid, Gobi Desert, an excellent ground for
warfare of the North African variety, and between the

part of the belt, is recognized as a Russian dependency.
Other Factors
It is thus not improbable that if Russia should attack
Japan, the former's armies would make great gains at
first. But the fact remains that the war would be very
difficult because of two factors.
1. Russia is nowhere near the power in the Pacific
that she is in Europe.
2. Before Russia could invade Southern China, she
would have to go through many mountain ranges where
her armored superiority would be decreased in im
portance as a strategic factor.
The reason that Russia would not be such a strong
force in the East is that Siberia is yet incapable of
supporting a gigantic army, and thus the supplies for
a Russian offensive would have to be railed across the
two Trans-Siberian Lines. Still, after they got to the
front, they would have to be taken down over the
narrow, winding roads that lead into the Mongolian-
Manchurian-Sinkiang belt, and this would cause a
terrific supply problem. Thus the full force of the Red
Army could not be used in a Japanese war, no matter
how much Marshal Stalin would want to employ it.
Secondly is the question of the mountain ranges. The
Red Army was not designed for mountain fighting, but
lor battles ol vast plains and steppes. The only mountain
barrier it came up against in this war has been the
Carpathians, and this was turned by a breathrough at
the Galati Gap. between the mountains and the sea.
Ihe line was not forced until the Germans were so
weak (hat they couldn't hold it.
The lumbering Stalin Tanks would probably find
themselves in trouble climbing the precipitious heights
ol C hina, and the extremely mobile Japanese 37 mm.
rapid-fire anti-tank gun could cause havoc.
Thus the big question of quick victory or a long
campaign in China lies in how fast the Japanese can
shift enough materials to the continent of Asia to sup
port an army there, independent of Japan's home
less to them, since it could be conquered easily. But
islands. Manchurian industry would probably be use-
Japan will be cut off from China, and vice versa,
whether the Japs like it or not. and thus will come the
question, can the Japanese keep an army going in
( hina without the bene!it of Japanese home pro
d uction?
One of the most significant products of the Yalta
Conference was the announcement of the coming talks
in San Francisco, which—and this is the joker—are to
be held on the same date as the Russo-Japanese non
aggression pact expires.
Coupled with this comes the announcement of the
militant but ineffective Chinese Communist party that
it will accept Chaing-Kai-Chek as a "leader, but not
as a dictator."
Kusso-Jap War
The slightly growing cohesion between Russia and
China, and the obvious diplomatic slap in Japan's face,
might indicate that the Soviet Union will join the battle
in the Far East. This will certainly help settle affairs in
China, since it will be a lot easier to bring the
enemy to a decisive battle by an advance all along
the line of the Siberian frontier, than it will be to
fightour way out of a narrow beachhead on the
China coast.
So, since the Russo-Jap war is a definite possi
bility, it is certainly advisable to discuss the
strategic aspects in advance.
Jap Problem
The Japanese dilemma lies in the geography of North"
ern China. China and the Mongolian and Manchurian
dependencies, are separated from Siberia by a rugged
line of mountains running east west. South of this
the country is divided into three sectors. First, there
is the broken terrain of Sinkiang Province, a good
prize for Russia if she could net it in a peace treaty
because of yet-untapped oil resources. West of Einkiang
is the flat, arid, Gobi Desert, an excellent ground for
warfare of the North African variety, and between the
Gobi Desert and the sea, the rich and well-developed
province of Manchuria.
This belt of land is bounded on the south by another
line of mountains, and by the famous Great Wall, and.
on its coastal side, the belt funnels into the Korean
Peninsula, the gulf between it and Japan being the only
way by which the enemy can keep contact between
his home islands and China without exposing his ship
ping lanes to American naval superiority.
Now, the Japanese can do two things. Either they
can retire behind the southern mountain belt or else
they can risk a tank battle on the flat lands of the
Gobi Desert. If they accept the former alternative,
they give up contact with Japan proper, while, if they
try the latter, they would probably find their whole
army cut to pieces.
Armored Strength
The Japanese armor is definitely inferior to anything
the Russians have, and this would decide any battle,
say, in the Gobi Desert. Japanese tanks were designed
for jungle warfare, where lightness and mobility are
the chief points to be desired. Thus, their armored
columns would be undergunned by the gigantic Russian
Stalin Tanks, and would certainly not stand up against
the blasts of Red 75 mm. tank cannons, to which they
could only reply with 37 mm. guns or worse.
Also, the Japanese cannot try to hold the Russians
behind the Siberian frontier mountains, because the
Russians are already beyond them. Outer "Mongolia,
part of the belt, is recognized as a Russian dependency.
