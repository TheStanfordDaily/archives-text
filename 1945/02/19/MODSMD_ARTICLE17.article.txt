# Should Cellar Open On Friday Nights?
## 
### 
The Cellar did not open Friday
night because two of the hashers
were unable to work.
The Cellar committee is anxious
to know whether the students really
want the Cellar open on Friday night
or whether four nights a week
would be sufficient. Students may
give their opinions to some member

I of Excom or write to The Daily.
"A sign reminding students to pay
their checks before leaving the Cellar
will be put up tonight," Jim Emerson
said, "and we hope the Cellar's rec
ord for the second week will be
better than that of the first."
