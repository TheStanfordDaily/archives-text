# Pow-Wow Entries Due by Tonight
## 
### 
Midnight tonight marks the close
of the Pow-Wow entry period, ac
cording to Chairman Peggy Fitts.
For groups with plenty of time, Miss
Fitts advises phoning her at 22151;
for those who decide at 11:59 (or any
time after 10:30 p.m.) that they wish
to enter, calls should be to Corky
Wallman at 8606.
Over 20 entries have already been
submitted to Miss Fittsâ€”from a rep
resentative slice of Stanford woman
hood and manhood, including mem
bers of the high type, clean-cut up
right Daily staff, and men from the
Chaparral.
Repeating that stunt ideas need
be described to her in only the
vaguest terms, Miss Fitts urged
every campus group to express its
spirit by entering. Chairmen of each
Pow-Wow group will receive Ram's
Head points, and winners will re
ceive prizes for the best-done, most
original and funniest acts.
