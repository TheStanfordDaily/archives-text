Bill Ranklin, UCLA's battling Bruins
Saturday night completely upset the j
pre-season dope bucket by defeat- !
ing USC. 34 to 28, to win their first j
southern division P.C.C. basketball j
crown. II was the Bruins' second vic
tory of the season over their cross
town rivals, early championship
favorites, and gained them the right j
to meet the northern division win- |
tiers for the playoff series.
UCLA opened quickly to take an
early lead in the contest which they
maintained throughout, holding an
18 to 12 edge at the half-time. Rank
line, who played one of the best I
games of his career, was the spark- !
plug of the Bruin attack, scoring six !
field goals and two free throws to |
lead both teams with 14 points. The j
Trojans were paced by their rangy |
center, Jack Nichols, and guard Bob >
Graham, who between them counted '
for 21 of their team's 28 points.
First Crown
This is the first time since they
loined the conference in 1928 that
he "baby members" have ever won
i basketball title. Southern Cali
fornia was a heavy favorite to dis
place Cal for the championship
previously this season, but Bobby
Muth's squad was plagued by illness !
and injuries and faltered in the
stretch, dropping an upset tilt to I
California and an earlier game to the l
Bruins. This is also the first time j
chat UCLA has ever succeeded in j
downing her rival more than once |
tn a season. The two teams have yet ]
another game scheduled this year, j
but it will not count officially in !
conference standings.
If transportation can be arranged, j
a playoff series with the winner of
the northern division of the confer- ;
ence, composed of Oregon, Oregon
State. Washington, Washington State, I
and Idaho will be held later, prob
ably in Los Angeles. At present Ore- 1
gon State and Washington State are j
out in front up north.
Final standings for the southern
division are as follows:
W. L. I'ct.
UCLA 4 1 .800
usc 2 .400
California 1 it .250

Sparked by sensational forward *
Bill Ranklin, UCLA's battling Bruins
Saturday night completely upset the j
pre-season dope bucket by defeat- !
ing USC. 34 to 28, to win their first j
southern division P.C.C. basketball j
crown. II was the Bruins' second vic
tory of the season over their cross
town rivals, early championship
favorites, and gained them the right j
to meet the northern division win- |
tiers for the playoff series.
UCLA opened quickly to take an
early lead in the contest which they
maintained throughout, holding an
18 to 12 edge at the half-time. Rank
line, who played one of the best I
games of his career, was the spark- !
plug of the Bruin attack, scoring six !
field goals and two free throws to |
lead both teams with 14 points. The j
Trojans were paced by their rangy |
center, Jack Nichols, and guard Bob >
Graham, who between them counted '
for 21 of their team's 28 points.
First Crown
This is the first time since they
loined the conference in 1928 that
he "baby members" have ever won
i basketball title. Southern Cali
fornia was a heavy favorite to dis
place Cal for the championship
previously this season, but Bobby
Muth's squad was plagued by illness !
and injuries and faltered in the
stretch, dropping an upset tilt to I
California and an earlier game to the l
Bruins. This is also the first time j
chat UCLA has ever succeeded in j
downing her rival more than once |
tn a season. The two teams have yet ]
another game scheduled this year, j
but it will not count officially in !
conference standings.
If transportation can be arranged, j
a playoff series with the winner of
the northern division of the confer- ;
ence, composed of Oregon, Oregon
State. Washington, Washington State, I
and Idaho will be held later, prob
ably in Los Angeles. At present Ore- 1
gon State and Washington State are j
out in front up north.
Final standings for the southern
division are as follows:
W. L. I'ct.
UCLA 4 1 .800
usc 2 .400
California 1 it .250
