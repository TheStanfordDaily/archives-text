"A folk song is any song people
anywhere make their own." With
this definition of a folk song, Des
mond S. Powell, assistant professor
of humanities and English, last
Thursday outlined for the American
Studies Symposium some attitudes
toward American folklore since the
end of the 18th century.
Mr. Powell expressed his faith in
the vitality of American folk music
and ballads, but said that folklore
"needs critical editing and organiza
tion" and the most vital material
must be brought before the general
student of folklore, not only the
specialized scholar.
"The real music and verse of the
common man has on the whole been
ignored by the literateurs, Mr.
Powell said, mentioning that even
Walt Whitman, "the poet of democ
racy," was deaf to the original ballads
and songs of the woodsman, carpen
ter. and housewife of whom he wrote.
Although much folk lore was in
existence prior to the Civil War, it
was not until the end of the war
that it began to be recognized, Mr.
Powell said. Negro spirituals were
then introduced, and the war had
made people ready to accept Negro
songs. Mr. Powelk repudiated as
fallacies the beliefs that Negro spirit
uals arose as a direct result of their
enslaved condition and that their
folk tunes were brought over from
Africa.
