# Forum Held On Medical Legislation
## 
### RAY WISSLER 
Spirited discussions and lively
questions and answers following the
talks of five authorities on health
service plans highlighted the panel
discussion, "Prepaid Health Insur
ance — What Kind of a Program
Should I Be For?" Wednesday at the
Palo Alto Women's Clubhouse.
The filled auditorium was evidence
of a lively interest in this first of a
series of open forums on vital prob
lems sponsored by the Democratic
forum of Palo Alto, as well as of
public interest in the two medical
bills now before the State Legis
lature.
Panel Includes Senators
The panel included Senator Byrl
Salsman and Senator John Shelly,
both of the California Legislature,
Mr. David Hedley of the CIO, Dr.
John H. Shepherd of San Jose, and
Dr. R. Stanley Knceshaw of San
Jose. Charles H. McDonald, presi
dent of the Palo Alto Democratic
Club presided. Robert S. Peckham
acted as moderator.
The five speakers discussed the
two proposed measures for com
pulsory health service now before
the State Legislature: The Thomas
Bill, sometimes called The People's
Health Act, and Governor Warren's
Bill.
Government Medicine Favored
Senator Byrl Salsman, who spoke
first, declared that polls of the opin
ion of the general public and of the
medical profession indicate that a
majority of the people in California
favor "some form of government
medicine." Expressing the belief that
if one of the health service bills now
before the Legislature is not passed
there will follow a successful effort
to write some provision for medical
service into the State Constitution,
the senator said:
"If we take the wise course and
enact a bill during this session we
can later amend it to make it work
able, whereas if a constitutional
amendment is passed it will be next
to impossible to modify it to make
a program more workable. If good
amendments are suggested for the
Warren Bill I'm sure they will be
taken."
(Editorial note: This review of the
forum will be continued in Tues
day's Daily.
