# Printing of Song Book Delayed
## 
### 
Publication of the Music Coun
cil's projected song book has been
temporarily held up. owing to copy
right difficulties which may force
the Council to publish the book
without the music to the songs, an
nounced Bob Miller, Council chair
man.
Copyrights to the Stanford songs
are owned by the Allen Music Co.
of New York, and purchasing them
would involve more time, money,
and effort than the Council thinks
necessary, since most students know
the melodies to Stanford songs.
More Songs Wanted
The list of songs for the book is
not yet full, said Miller, and he is
sued a special plea to the fraterni
ties on campus to turn in some of
their songs (such as the "sweet
heart" songs) for publication. The
book will include not only Stanford
songs, but also popular campus mel
odies that are not directly associ
ated with Stanford.
