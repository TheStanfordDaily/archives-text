# SWB Outlines War Jobs
## 
### 
(Editorial note: This is a statement hy Jeannette Grimsley, War Board
Coordinator:)
"This is not- a list of 'what counts as war work,' but is a list of sugges
tions, made by the SWB, of the opportunities for students to serve the
United States during the time not occupied by their studies. Let us all
cooperate and do these jobs which have been put before us. If anyone has
any further suggestions to make, the SWB would appreciate knowing of

them so that they may be passed
on to other students."
