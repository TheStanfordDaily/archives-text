# Stanford Life, Topic Of Campus Assembly
## 
### 
Thronging to the Memorial Auditorium for the first all-campus assembly
of this academic year, Stanford students will hear Dr. Tresidder, the Uni
versity band, and the faculty chorus, under the direction of Dr. Jan Popper,
for an hour of class-free entertainment at 10 p.m. tomorrow.
Under the direction of Carol Hurwitz and the sponsorship of Cardinals

the assembly was organized to pro
vide an opportunity for the Stanford
Family to get together, not only to
audit but participate in the musical
program planned.
Speaking on Stanford Life
Dr. Tresidder's speech, ' A Way of
Life," will be directed to all stu
dents and will concern the Stanford
way of life.
Said Miss Hurwitz, "Although the
war has prevented many of the get
togethers we formerly would have
had—at football games, rallies, treks
to the city—we can still have as
semblies, which have always been
fun in the past, and give Farm men
and women an opportunity to re
lease some of their pent-up school
spirit. That was Cardinals' reason for
sponsoring this assembly."
Our Traditions
Cardinals, in the interests of tradi
tions long established and observed
at Stanford, reminded students of
three that are a part of our every
day life:
Not smoking within the four cor
ners of Quad.
Not walking up or down the Law
steps, long ago hallowed as the law
students' property.
Saying hello, whenever you meet
a Stanford man or woman on campus.
