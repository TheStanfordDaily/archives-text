Outlining the purposes of the social policy, iMiss Marylou McClure,
A.S.S.U. vice-president and chairman of the recently organized Social
Committee, yesterday reiterated the purposes of the Social Committee in
conjunction with several points on the social policy which campus organi

The Social Committee was organized late last quarter to educate the

student body on the social policy;
and to supply functions for dates left
unfilled on the .social calendar.
Policy Violations

points on the social policy which
campus organizations have been
violating recently: (1) all organi
zations must apply for dates at
least one week in advance of the
proposed function; (2) no invita
tions can he issued, or tickets sold,
prior to the granting of the date
by Ex coin; and (.'{) lists of patrons
and patronesses must he submitted
to the A.S.S.U, office not less than
one week prior to the dance at
which they will he present.
Miss McClure also urged that
large campus organizations, such as
classes, apply for their spring quar
ter dates before the end of this quar
ter, so that they may lie sure of get
ting the dates they want.
Kxtra Copies of Social Policy
The committee has extra copies of
the social policy, and all women's
living group presidents who have
not yet received one are asked to
get one immediately, Miss McClure
said. Copies of the social policy
will be sent to the presidents of the
men's halls. Miss McClure asks any
one with questions on the social pol
icy to see her.
The Social Committee is composed
