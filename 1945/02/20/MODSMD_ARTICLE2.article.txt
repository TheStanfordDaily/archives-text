# Iwo Jima Fight Rages
## 
### 
U.S. PACIFIC FLEET HQ., Guam,
Feb. 19 (UP). â€”U.S. Marines fought
their way onto the number one air
field of Japan's home front island of
Iwo Jima today and battled ahead
foot by foot against strong enemy
resistance through a flame-lit, hell
ish night.
Fighting uphill at heavy cost, the
Marines stormed across the southern
end of the triangular field and be
fore dusk had secured that section
of it. Tonight the rest of the field
was a no man's land, in which Amer
. ican and Japanese fought hand to
' hand in a wild melee.
The blast of shells, bombs, and
rockets, the spurt of flame-throwers
and tho flicker of rifle and machine
gun bursts lit the two and one-h-df
mile beachhead which the Fourth
and Fifth Marine Divisions had
hacked out.
Eye-witness reports indicated that
by the end of ihc first day the Ma
rines, though their advances were
measured in hundreds of yards, had
fought across about half the width
of Iwo at its narrow southwestern
lip where they skirted the northern
slopes of the Suribachi volcano.
At the northern end of the lighting
line the Marines had advanced about
one-third of the way across the is
land.
