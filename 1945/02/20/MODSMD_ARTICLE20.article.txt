# Stanford Family Unites At Tradition Day Assembly
## 
### 
Today—the 20th—is Tradition Day.
A.s climax to a week-long publicity campaign for the observance of
traditions long-established and observed at Stanford, Cardinals has desig
nated an entire day on the University calendar in which these traditions
will be discussed, practiced, and, it is hoped, strengthened.

Spearheading the drive against'
students who have evaded the prac
tices established by Stanfordites in
classes preceding us by margins of
50 years, an all-campus assembly
will be held at 10 a.m. in the Me
morial Auditorium, at which Dr.
Tresidder will speak concerning "A
Way of Life."
Designed above all for the enjoy
ment of students and faculty mem
bers. classes will be dismissed and
will relax for an hour while Dr.
Popper directs the faculty chorus,
stars of spring quarter's assembly,
and the Stanford band plays rousing
college selections. Joining the re
tinue ol musicians on the stage, the
entire assembly will sing campus
favorites under Dr. Popper's direc
tions.

Members of the singing group, in
cluding the faculty chorus, arc as
follows:
Sopranos: Mrs. Charles Barker,
Mrs. D. S. Wheelwright, Jo-Ann Ed
wards, Winifred Lamm, Elizabeth
Otis.
Altos: Elizabeth Chapman, Mrs.
Jan Popper, Maxine Hedges.
Tenors: Dr. Q. Morgan, Professor
Max Savelle, Johnny High, Philip
McLean.
Basses: Professor Kirkpatrick, Jack
Taylor, Clarence Thurber and Bruce
Stewart.
The band will be led by its new
director, Mr. Philler Curtis.
Publicity for the assembly, begun
a week ago Monday with the appear
ance of an inch-high "20th," caused a
riot of rumors as to the nature of
the topic of Dr. Trcsidder's speech.
Carol Hurwitz, Cardinal's chairman
of Tradition Day, quelled the ru- '
mors with the admission that today's
get-together was for the pleasure
of the students, and to remind .stu
dents of, not force them into, the
observance of on Quad traditions.
Called into service have been the
law students, who will sit on the
law steps between classes and clap
down any women who attempt to
walk upon the hallowed cement. Be
cause it was their school who created
the Law Steps tradition, these stu
dents should have a special interest
in today's proceedings.
Although there are many more
Stanford traditions which have
bound students together in the past,
the three principle ones which can
be observed every day—TODAY—
are:
No Smoking on Quad.
i No walking down the law steps—
these are the exclusive property of
the law students.
Saying hello, whenever you meet
a Stanford man or women on cam
pus.
Students who assisted Miss Hur
witz were Dcdc Bergerot, in charge
of the musical program at the as
sembly; Cardinals members, who will
usher, and who helped in the organi
zation; and Pat Mooney and Martha
McCarn, who turned out the black,
red and white posters inquiring
"What's Up Doc?", "Are You 011 the
Beam?", and stating the mysterious
"20."
