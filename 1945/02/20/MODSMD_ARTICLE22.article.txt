I Many of the traditions which are
a vital part of Stanford's heritage
are lost in the obscurity of being
practised only once, perhaps twice a
year, on specific occasions.
Representatives of the senior class
each Sunday place flowers on the
Stanford Mausoleum in memory of
the University founders. Passed on

one belonging solely to seniors, as
is the tradition of preparing class
records, will, history and poem to

which run—a line of diamonds—
along the sidewalk in front of Me

Peculiar to the football season are
i the pajamerino, card stunts, bonfiie,
I Gaieties, and Axe traditions.
