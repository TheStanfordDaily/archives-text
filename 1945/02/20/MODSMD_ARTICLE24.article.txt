# Group Plans For Housing
## 
### 
Meeting for the second time, mem
bers of the Housing Committee yes
terday discussed the preliminary
questions of their limitations, func
tions, and aims as a committee cre
ated to formulate and recommend
workable plans for housing women
in the former sororities and other
women's living groups.
It was first agreed after full dis
cussion that the present freshman
dorm system be continued as op
posed to suggestions of the possible
advantages of mixing freshmen with
other students in all the women's
residences.
Sorority Houses Considered
Discussion centered next upon
whether the committee should con
sider plans for housing women in all
women's living groups or only in
those which were formerly sorority
houses. It seemed generally agreed
that it would be difficult if not fun
damentally undesirable to consider
one apart from the other.
Finally, under consideration came
the problem of whether the commit
tee's chief concern should be with
the immediate future of women's
housing at Stanford or whether they
should attempt to make plans with
a long-range view to what would bo
most desirable over the years. With
out bringing anything to a vote the
committee seemed to feel that, al
though both must be considered, the
long-range view should receive the
strongest emphasis.
Large Dorms to Be Separate
Further it was moved and carried
that the former sororities and the
houses of the Union Unit be consid
ered under one and the same plan
as small living units, while larger
dorms such as Lagunita, Roble, and
Branner be considered separately,
particularly where eating facilities,
house regulations, etc., were under
discussion.
Sally Breuner, chairman, ad
journed the meeting with the agree
ment that the committee should hold
its third meeting a week from today,
Tuesday, Feb. 27, from 7:30 to 9 in
the evening.
