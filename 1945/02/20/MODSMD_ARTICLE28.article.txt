# YES, YOU!

Today is our last day to hammer in some of
the practical, some of the ethical, some of the
more favored aspects of our favorite complaint,
laxness in preserving Stanford traditions.
Our contention is that it is especially import
ant during Stanford's war years with classes,
students, and our quarter to quarter plans uncer
tain, that the student body as a whole should
preserve the substance and the spirit of our tra
ditions.
We believe that they are part of the tie be
tween us and our school, the people who have
come and gone, those who will not come back,
and those who will yet come.
Now the subject rests, it has been deemed
important enough to be the subject of an all
campus tradition day, but the practice and ob
servance is a day to day affair.
It is obvious that the majority of students
think that these traditions are worthwhile be
cause the majority observe them. At one time
we have pointed out that the law students as a
group did not realize their obligations about
smoking on Quad. Other people, who unfortu
nately may be singled out in a group, are fac
ulty members who treat the whole matter as an
inconvenience, a childish whim, or just a chal
lenge for their rugged individualism.
We sincerely trust that members of the fac
ulty are quite old enough to decide what they
will or will not observe in the nature of their
contribution to Stanford life; we will remind
them, however, that they represent to students
an element of prestige on campus. Violations
of traditions, such as smoking on Quad, make
rome students underestimate the seriousness of
our pride in our University.
It is always easier to be influenced by the
minority who flout traditions; they stand out
from the larger numbers of people who respect
them. Therefore it has been more difficulr for
professors who are willing to abide by the tra
ditions to counteract their "devilish" colleagues.
Here also there are many more professors who
support Stanford traditions than those who do
not.
Nobody's stre'vn cigaret stubs are becoming
