20Tl! ... AT LAST
After weeks of wondering, whispering and waiting:
wondering who "Doc" is; whispering about "what's
up?" waiting to get "on the beam," Stanford finally
welcomes T-Day with an all-campus assembly.
Tradition Day. or T-Day as it is called by those in
the know, is the 20th which is today which is when
we have an entertainment assembly and a tradition
edition of the Daily which is good because there are
no 10 o'clock classes which means that Dr. F's Mystery
Hour and Bankruptcy MTThF will not meet.
Now for a few reflections on this revival of tradi
tions:
About smoking, a plan to form an Inner Quad In
quisition which would make yard-birds of fag flaunters
would probably be effective in reducing the number
of smokers on Quad. However, after today's assembly
and the present shortage it is doubtful if there will be
many Sinners on the Inner.
About the law steps, like other students who have
been here for countless quarters, I am not exactly sure
where these steps are. But. I am certain that I have
never ridden my bike either up or down them. A neon
ign "Law Student Parking Only" would undoubtedly
frighten away remaining offenders against this tradi
tion.
About the hello-ing of fellow students and profes
• ors, many Indians, especially those from the Toyon
Tepee, have run into difficulty as their enthusiasm for
bidding "hi" not only on the campus but also in Alto
Palo has unnerved its residents. Stanford suburbs must
be considered ofT-limits for those who suffer from the
automatic hello-complex.
But of all traditions that are being shoved into high
>rur. one deserves special attention. That is the water
h ,'iiil, defunct except for the few who cling

unflinchingly to their ideals and paper bags. Among
these few should be mentioned the Monroe Raiders,
Roble 2 center, and Chappie men, who stubbornly re
fuse to use chlorinated water.
