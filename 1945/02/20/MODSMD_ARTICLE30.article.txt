The landing on Iwo Jima, in the Volcano Islands
group, has caused a great deal of speculation about
the future course of the war in the Pacific.
The little island i.s, first of all, only 050 airline miles
from Japan, and the enemy has been using it as a base
to bomb Saipan, the starting point for Superfortress
raids, so the immediate significance of its capture is
that it might end these enemy air attacks and will
decrease the distance our planes have to travel.
However, some sources in Chungking have actually
come out with the claim that we will try to defeat
Japan by invading the home islands. They point out
that the moral blow might crush Japanese resistance
if we should gain the Empire mainland, and that this
step would be relatively easier than an attack on the
continent of Asia, since the main Japanese army is on
the latter.
Japan Invasion Improbable
However, the invasion of Japan itself is not too
much of a possibility for definite strategical resasons
that make it a tougher nut to crack than China.
First of all, the Japanese coast line is very rugged,
and there are not too many good spots suitable for
assault landings. Thus, our invasion would be chan
nelized, and the Japanese defense problem would be
simplified.
Secondly, such a course would be very much of a
gamble, since there are many tricky inlets and coves
that the Japanese naval command could choose as
battle areas. Superiority in numbers would be as much
of a hindrance as anything else in these narrow places,
since only the heads of battle columns could meet, and
a few well-posted ships and small carriers could do a
lot of damage to an invasion armada if surprise could
only give them the first salvo.

Third, the Japanese islands are webbed by an ex
cellent railroad system, and the Japanese high com
mand could probably rush troops to a beachhead faster
than we could reinforce it. We would not be capable
of the gigantic raids that paralyzed the French railroads
during the invasion of Europe, since our aircraft would
be based on small carriers, not on the British Isles.
In contrast, the larger Japanese army in China is,
of necessity, spread all over the map. It could never be
concentrated as quickly as the smaller one in the main
land. A small army that is fully in hand is worth a
lot more than one spread out, and thus the odds would
be more in our favor on a Chinese expedition than
on an invasion of Japan.
But, with China taken and with the rail line to
Singapore severed, the enemy would find himself
blockaded in his little, unproductive islands, and, by
the effective process of. blockade, Japan could be blood
lessly forced to come to terms.

Japan Invasion Improbable
However, the invasion of Japan itself is not too
much of a possibility for definite strategical resasons
that make it a tougher nut to crack than China.
First of all, the Japanese coast line is very rugged,
and there are not too many good spots suitable for
assault landings. Thus, our invasion would be chan
nelized, and the Japanese defense problem would be
simplified.
Secondly, such a course would be very much of a
gamble, since there are many tricky inlets and coves
that the Japanese naval command could choose as
battle areas. Superiority in numbers would be as much
of a hindrance as anything else in these narrow places,
since only the heads of battle columns could meet, and
a few well-posted ships and small carriers could do a
lot of damage to an invasion armada if surprise could
only give them the first salvo.

Third, the Japanese islands are webbed by an ex
cellent railroad system, and the Japanese high com
mand could probably rush troops to a beachhead faster
than we could reinforce it. We would not be capable
of the gigantic raids that paralyzed the French railroads
during the invasion of Europe, since our aircraft would
be based on small carriers, not on the British Isles.
In contrast, the larger Japanese army in China is,
of necessity, spread all over the map. It could never be
concentrated as quickly as the smaller one in the main
land. A small army that is fully in hand is worth a
lot more than one spread out, and thus the odds would
be more in our favor on a Chinese expedition than
on an invasion of Japan.
But, with China taken and with the rail line to
Singapore severed, the enemy would find himself
blockaded in his little, unproductive islands, and, by
the effective process of. blockade, Japan could be blood
lessly forced to come to terms.
The landing on Iwo Jima, in the Volcano Islands
group, has caused a great deal of speculation about
the future course of the war in the Pacific.
The little island i.s, first of all, only 050 airline miles
from Japan, and the enemy has been using it as a base
to bomb Saipan, the starting point for Superfortress
raids, so the immediate significance of its capture is
that it might end these enemy air attacks and will
decrease the distance our planes have to travel.
However, some sources in Chungking have actually
come out with the claim that we will try to defeat
Japan by invading the home islands. They point out
that the moral blow might crush Japanese resistance
if we should gain the Empire mainland, and that this
step would be relatively easier than an attack on the
continent of Asia, since the main Japanese army is on
the latter.
