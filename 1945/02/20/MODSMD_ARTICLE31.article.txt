### Walrus the Carpenter 
War, for a democracy, say its apologists, is a tem
porary but necessary relapse into totalitarian means
and methods in order to preserve the very existence
and integrity of democracy. And conscription, they
add, is a necessary if unpleasant part of the machinery
necessary in waging a war.
At the present time we seem to be adopting the
totalitarian pattern to an ever increasing degree.
There are now two legislative measures before Con
gress which propose to extend and increase the con
scriptive powers of the government: first, the "work
or light" hill; second, the proposal for postwar com
pulsory military training.
We are living in critical times that require many
far-reaching sacrifices, but in the past few years, under
the emotional strains of wartime and amidst the din
of continual propaganda, we have become insensitive
to the peril in which many real values of our everyday
life stand. Passively we allow and accept far-reaching
authoritarian patterns to be forced upon us, cloaked in
the all-excusing but irresponsibly used phrase: "It's
essential for the war effort."
In a democracy the judgment of an individual is
suppo«>ed to he respected, and the value of the indi
vidual as a human being is supposed to be para
mount. By what peculiar deceit, then, are we able
to convince ourselves that conscription—which leaves
no responsibility to the individual—is a process in
any way compatible with democracy?
If we are going to preserve a democracy we must
retain a high respect for the value of the individual as
a human being, not as a soldier, not as a part of the
state. Democracy relies upon and depends upon indi
vidual initiative, not upon coercion of the individual.
A democratic character cannot be formed nor main
tained in a system that depends upon regimentation
and indoctrination, or that treats people as a mass of
labile minds and bodies to be molded by the state for
its own purposes—however good may be the inten
tions or purposes of the state.
Compulsory military training does not make for
democracy. As the men in the Army realize most
acutely, just the opposite traits are fostered than
those we should seek to foster in a democracy. Regi
mentation. unquestioning obedience, unthinking ac
ceptance of an officer's commands—these are essen
tial elements of military life.

We must never forget our responsibilities at home
and abroad; we cannot forget the sacrifice and suffer
ing of those who fight in this war; but neither can
we forget that we are struggling to maintain a faith
in the individual freedom and individual responsi
bility of human beings, for if we lose this, the war
will have been fought in vain.

authoritarian patterns to be forced upon us, cloaked in
the all-excusing but irresponsibly used phrase: "It's
essential for the war effort."
In a democracy the judgment of an individual is
suppo«>ed to he respected, and the value of the indi
vidual as a human being is supposed to be para
mount. By what peculiar deceit, then, are we able
to convince ourselves that conscription—which leaves
no responsibility to the individual—is a process in
any way compatible with democracy?
If we are going to preserve a democracy we must
retain a high respect for the value of the individual as
a human being, not as a soldier, not as a part of the
state. Democracy relies upon and depends upon indi
vidual initiative, not upon coercion of the individual.
A democratic character cannot be formed nor main
tained in a system that depends upon regimentation
and indoctrination, or that treats people as a mass of
labile minds and bodies to be molded by the state for
its own purposes—however good may be the inten
tions or purposes of the state.
Compulsory military training does not make for
democracy. As the men in the Army realize most
acutely, just the opposite traits are fostered than
those we should seek to foster in a democracy. Regi
mentation. unquestioning obedience, unthinking ac
ceptance of an officer's commands—these are essen
tial elements of military life.

We must never forget our responsibilities at home
and abroad; we cannot forget the sacrifice and suffer
ing of those who fight in this war; but neither can
we forget that we are struggling to maintain a faith
in the individual freedom and individual responsi
bility of human beings, for if we lose this, the war
will have been fought in vain.

War, for a democracy, say its apologists, is a tem
porary but necessary relapse into totalitarian means
and methods in order to preserve the very existence
and integrity of democracy. And conscription, they
add, is a necessary if unpleasant part of the machinery
necessary in waging a war.
At the present time we seem to be adopting the
totalitarian pattern to an ever increasing degree.
There are now two legislative measures before Con
gress which propose to extend and increase the con
scriptive powers of the government: first, the "work
or light" hill; second, the proposal for postwar com
pulsory military training.
We are living in critical times that require many
far-reaching sacrifices, but in the past few years, under
the emotional strains of wartime and amidst the din
of continual propaganda, we have become insensitive
to the peril in which many real values of our everyday
life stand. Passively we allow and accept far-reaching
authoritarian patterns to be forced upon us, cloaked in
the all-excusing but irresponsibly used phrase: "It's
essential for the war effort."
