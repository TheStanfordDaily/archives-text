The Editor:
I wish to express my approval of the recent plan for
reorganization of the method of representation in Stan
ford student government which appeared in your edi
torial column. This carefully formulated plan should
be able to help restore the necessary link between the
man on the campus" and the officers of student
government.
We who favor this change do not present it as a
cure-all for the ills of student government. Such a
cure-all, if indeed one exists, could come only by in
creased student government. We do believe, however,
that a system of representation based on the living
group rather than the class is an important step toward
the goal of greater individual participation.
Let s hear what some of the rest of you think. Here
is a chance to use our campus newspaper for a discus
sion of student affairs.
Sincerely.
