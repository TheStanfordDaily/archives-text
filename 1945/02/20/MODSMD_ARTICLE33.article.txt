# OUR HASHER
## 
### JOE SHER 
Under a deep blue sky the Stan
ford boathouse nestles in a little
hollow (used to be an old cow pas
ture, one step on the bottom will
convince anyone) surrounded by
clear, cool (a synonyn, for cold as
hell) water and a fringe of trees,
which make it one of the most beau
tiful spots in the state of California.
The smooth, (wear your armor
when you come up or else bring the
tweezers for your leg) well-painted
dock affords ample space to accom
modate every student, if 2900 will
sit on the surrounding grass. Here
Farm men and women sit and com
mune with nature and each other.
Among the various people we find
up there are the students, the bridge
enthusiasts, the' suntan fiends, the
canoeist, and a hodge podge of varied
types.
Mistake of Lifetime
The student is the person who
comes to the boathouse to catch up
on his work—the mistake of a life
time. He usually ends up trying
frantically to salvage his notes from
the breeze and himself from being
trampled by the horde of eager peo
ple running back and forth or drag
ging canoes across his body. He soon
gives up in frantic despair and runs
home screaming that "like the wheat
his efforts have been reaped."
Then there is the suntan fiend who
brings his suntan oil, which could
have been donated to making bullets,
sun glasses, a towel—and proceeds
to drop on the float. He smears
himself liberally with oil. puts on his
glasses, a hat to keep the sun off
of his head, a towel to cover his
tender toes, and thus foi-tified he
crawls under an umbrella and moans
that he has very tender skin and
doesn't dare expose himself to the
torrid rays of the nasty old sun.
Lifeguards Have Headaches
The next is the canoeist. This little
student is the life guard's headache.
He has had years of experience with
canoes (usually confined to sitting
in one in Smith's) and swaggers into
the boathouse with a "let me have
a fast caftoe, I am a Stanford tax
payer and I demand my rights." Of
course the guards immediately bow
and hurry to fullfill his slightest
wish and three hours later he steps
into the canoe. He then proceeds to
paddle out a little ways and begins
changing his seat so that everyone
can see how well he is doing. In the
process he falls into the water. Of
course he has neglected to tell any
one that he couldn't swim and the
life guard drags him out of the water,
brings him to, and he begins to howl
that "the damm canoe was one of
the worst he has ever been in—why
was he allowed to go out in it, why
didn't the guard get there sooner
and so on and so on. At this point
the guard ties an anchor to his leg
and throws him back into the water
—loose more students this way.
Kick Him In
The bridge player is in his element
here in the sun. 'Neath its blazing
rays he thinks of tremendous ways
to make hands and bigger and better
alibis when he goes down. His hands
smoothed by wind and water, play
havoc with the new cards. The
crowning touch occurs when he
throws his hand down in disgust and
some of the cards fall in the water.
Of course in the next instant he is
also in the water, propelled by an
irate foot (yours of course) and the
guards are reaching down into the
water and hauling him out.
Included in the hodge-podge are
the people who love to splash cold
water on you when you have just
dried off, the fiend who roars with
delight as he shoves you into the
water (these die young too), canoe
tippers, raft tippers, foam blowers
(oops) and the thousands of other
odd characters who frequent this
little gathering place.
Come On Over
The boathouse is the property of
every Stanford student, so let's drop
around and see it, especially now
that it is open for the season and
the weather is fine. Take your chance
for we are all hoping for rain so
that the lake will be good all during
spring quarter.
Overhead in the Cellar: One group
one student, "Are you going to
Rossotti's tonight?"
Second student: "No, I am going
to see Frenchmen's Cieek."
First student, now in group four:
"Who is having a party there to
night?"

tweezers for your leg) well-painted
dock affords ample space to accom
modate every student, if 2900 will
sit on the surrounding grass. Here
Farm men and women sit and com
mune with nature and each other.
Among the various people we find
up there are the students, the bridge
enthusiasts, the' suntan fiends, the
canoeist, and a hodge podge of varied
types.
Mistake of Lifetime
The student is the person who
comes to the boathouse to catch up
on his work—the mistake of a life
time. He usually ends up trying
frantically to salvage his notes from
the breeze and himself from being
trampled by the horde of eager peo
ple running back and forth or drag
ging canoes across his body. He soon
gives up in frantic despair and runs
home screaming that "like the wheat
his efforts have been reaped."
Then there is the suntan fiend who
brings his suntan oil, which could
have been donated to making bullets,
sun glasses, a towel—and proceeds
to drop on the float. He smears
himself liberally with oil. puts on his
glasses, a hat to keep the sun off
of his head, a towel to cover his
tender toes, and thus foi-tified he
crawls under an umbrella and moans
that he has very tender skin and
doesn't dare expose himself to the
torrid rays of the nasty old sun.
Lifeguards Have Headaches
The next is the canoeist. This little
student is the life guard's headache.
He has had years of experience with
canoes (usually confined to sitting
in one in Smith's) and swaggers into
the boathouse with a "let me have
a fast caftoe, I am a Stanford tax
payer and I demand my rights." Of
course the guards immediately bow
and hurry to fullfill his slightest
wish and three hours later he steps
into the canoe. He then proceeds to
paddle out a little ways and begins
changing his seat so that everyone
can see how well he is doing. In the
process he falls into the water. Of
course he has neglected to tell any
one that he couldn't swim and the
life guard drags him out of the water,
brings him to, and he begins to howl
that "the damm canoe was one of
the worst he has ever been in—why
was he allowed to go out in it, why
didn't the guard get there sooner
and so on and so on. At this point
the guard ties an anchor to his leg
and throws him back into the water
—loose more students this way.
Kick Him In
The bridge player is in his element
here in the sun. 'Neath its blazing
rays he thinks of tremendous ways
to make hands and bigger and better
alibis when he goes down. His hands
smoothed by wind and water, play
havoc with the new cards. The
crowning touch occurs when he
throws his hand down in disgust and
some of the cards fall in the water.
Of course in the next instant he is
also in the water, propelled by an
irate foot (yours of course) and the
guards are reaching down into the
water and hauling him out.
Included in the hodge-podge are
the people who love to splash cold
water on you when you have just
dried off, the fiend who roars with
delight as he shoves you into the
water (these die young too), canoe
tippers, raft tippers, foam blowers
(oops) and the thousands of other
odd characters who frequent this
little gathering place.
Come On Over
The boathouse is the property of
every Stanford student, so let's drop
around and see it, especially now
that it is open for the season and
the weather is fine. Take your chance
for we are all hoping for rain so
that the lake will be good all during
spring quarter.
Overhead in the Cellar: One group
one student, "Are you going to
Rossotti's tonight?"
Second student: "No, I am going
to see Frenchmen's Cieek."
First student, now in group four:
"Who is having a party there to
night?"
Under a deep blue sky the Stan
ford boathouse nestles in a little
hollow (used to be an old cow pas
ture, one step on the bottom will
convince anyone) surrounded by
clear, cool (a synonyn, for cold as
hell) water and a fringe of trees,
which make it one of the most beau
tiful spots in the state of California.

The student is the person who
comes to the boathouse to catch up
on his work—the mistake of a life
time. He usually ends up trying
frantically to salvage his notes from
the breeze and himself from being
trampled by the horde of eager peo
ple running back and forth or drag
ging canoes across his body. He soon
gives up in frantic despair and runs
home screaming that "like the wheat
his efforts have been reaped."
Then there is the suntan fiend who
brings his suntan oil, which could
have been donated to making bullets,
sun glasses, a towel—and proceeds
to drop on the float. He smears
himself liberally with oil. puts on his
glasses, a hat to keep the sun off
of his head, a towel to cover his
tender toes, and thus foi-tified he
crawls under an umbrella and moans
that he has very tender skin and
doesn't dare expose himself to the
torrid rays of the nasty old sun.
Lifeguards Have Headaches
The next is the canoeist. This little
student is the life guard's headache.
He has had years of experience with
canoes (usually confined to sitting
in one in Smith's) and swaggers into
the boathouse with a "let me have
a fast caftoe, I am a Stanford tax
payer and I demand my rights." Of
course the guards immediately bow
and hurry to fullfill his slightest
wish and three hours later he steps
into the canoe. He then proceeds to
paddle out a little ways and begins
changing his seat so that everyone
can see how well he is doing. In the
process he falls into the water. Of
course he has neglected to tell any
one that he couldn't swim and the
life guard drags him out of the water,
brings him to, and he begins to howl
that "the damm canoe was one of
the worst he has ever been in—why
was he allowed to go out in it, why
didn't the guard get there sooner
and so on and so on. At this point
the guard ties an anchor to his leg
and throws him back into the water
—loose more students this way.
Kick Him In
The bridge player is in his element
here in the sun. 'Neath its blazing
rays he thinks of tremendous ways
to make hands and bigger and better
alibis when he goes down. His hands
smoothed by wind and water, play
havoc with the new cards. The
crowning touch occurs when he
throws his hand down in disgust and
some of the cards fall in the water.
Of course in the next instant he is
also in the water, propelled by an
irate foot (yours of course) and the
guards are reaching down into the
water and hauling him out.
Included in the hodge-podge are
the people who love to splash cold
water on you when you have just
dried off, the fiend who roars with
delight as he shoves you into the
water (these die young too), canoe
tippers, raft tippers, foam blowers
(oops) and the thousands of other
odd characters who frequent this
little gathering place.
Come On Over
The boathouse is the property of
every Stanford student, so let's drop
around and see it, especially now
that it is open for the season and
the weather is fine. Take your chance
for we are all hoping for rain so
that the lake will be good all during
spring quarter.
Overhead in the Cellar: One group
one student, "Are you going to
Rossotti's tonight?"
Second student: "No, I am going
to see Frenchmen's Cieek."
First student, now in group four:
"Who is having a party there to
night?"
