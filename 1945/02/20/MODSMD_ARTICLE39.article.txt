# Clothing Needed For Netherlands
## 
### 
| An appeal for all types of warm
1 clothing, shoes, underwear, and
blankets for Netherlands relief has
been made to Stanford students by
the Queen Wilhelmina Fund, Inc.,
of the U.S.A.
As a part of this Share-Your-
Clothes campaign, which closes next
Monday, students are asked to check
through their clothes for articles to
contribute to the drive. Garments
shoiild be clean and in good repair
in order that upon arrival in the
Netherlands they can be irnmedi

ately put to use. That they be dry
eleanod or pressed is not necessary,
however.
All articles should be left at the
War Board office or given to the
living group War Board representa
tive before Monday. Feb. 20.
