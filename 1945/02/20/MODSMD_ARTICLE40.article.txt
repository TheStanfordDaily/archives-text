### CORDON LEVY 
Now that War Mobilization Direc
tor Jimmy Byrnes has indicated that
sports will not be stopped because
of manpower needs, we feci obliged
to compliment the efforts of the
San Francisco Chronicle's hard-hit
ling sports editor. Bill Leiser. Mis
forceful attitude toward the drastic
curtailment at which Byrnes hinted
was noticed enough to make the
pages of TIME magazine.
Byrnes' proposal to grab man
power by closing baseball and put
able 4-F athletes in the army seemed,
according to Leiser, nothing more
than an attempt to make people
think that the bureacrats were fol
lowing up public disapproval. No
one was being fooled by the loud
yells coming out of Washington,
however.
Soldiers and government officials
knew well enough that Pete Gray,
the one-armed outfielder, could play
baseball but could not fight under
adverse battle conditions. They also
knew that a fellow with eyesight
good enough to play football still
could not be expected to see well
enough at a distance of 100 yards
to put his bullet in a Jap. They also
knew that under battle conditions a
man's physical ability cannot af
ford to fail, while the situation on
the baseball diamond does not in
volve the lives of other men.
Soldiers and sailors overseas rely
on sports alone to keep their America
the same as when they left . . .
when they hear over delayed short
wave that the Dodgers beat the
Giants they know that their freedom

at home is stiil intact. Athletics is
the basis of democracy. Hitler began
his Fascist movement with an aboli
tion of such free sports, with govern
ment control taking its place.
If it's manpower that Mr. Byrnes
is looking for, he can get far better
results by closing nightclubs and
bars. If be must take away the only
form of relaxation for weary war
workers in the field of horse racing
or any other sport, let him stop the
theaters and shows, also. We are
wondering why manpower can only
be acquired through restricting
sports and not other forms of en
tertainment.
The recent announcement from Mr.
Byrnes that sports (meaning, es
sentially, professional baseball) will
not be curtailed any more for the
duration seems to be the result of
the efforts of such influences as
those of Bill Leiser. We think that
men who stand up for American
principles such as Leiser should be
given a pat on the back. Congrats,
Bill.

Byrnes' proposal to grab man
power by closing baseball and put
able 4-F athletes in the army seemed,
according to Leiser, nothing more
than an attempt to make people
think that the bureacrats were fol
lowing up public disapproval. No
one was being fooled by the loud
yells coming out of Washington,
however.
Soldiers and government officials
knew well enough that Pete Gray,
the one-armed outfielder, could play
baseball but could not fight under
adverse battle conditions. They also
knew that a fellow with eyesight
good enough to play football still
could not be expected to see well
enough at a distance of 100 yards
to put his bullet in a Jap. They also
knew that under battle conditions a
man's physical ability cannot af
ford to fail, while the situation on
the baseball diamond does not in
volve the lives of other men.
Soldiers and sailors overseas rely
on sports alone to keep their America
the same as when they left . . .
when they hear over delayed short
wave that the Dodgers beat the
Giants they know that their freedom

at home is stiil intact. Athletics is
the basis of democracy. Hitler began
his Fascist movement with an aboli
tion of such free sports, with govern
ment control taking its place.
If it's manpower that Mr. Byrnes
is looking for, he can get far better
results by closing nightclubs and
bars. If be must take away the only
form of relaxation for weary war
workers in the field of horse racing
or any other sport, let him stop the
theaters and shows, also. We are
wondering why manpower can only
be acquired through restricting
sports and not other forms of en
tertainment.
The recent announcement from Mr.
Byrnes that sports (meaning, es
sentially, professional baseball) will
not be curtailed any more for the
duration seems to be the result of
the efforts of such influences as
those of Bill Leiser. We think that
men who stand up for American
principles such as Leiser should be
given a pat on the back. Congrats,
Bill.
Now that War Mobilization Direc
tor Jimmy Byrnes has indicated that
sports will not be stopped because
of manpower needs, we feci obliged
to compliment the efforts of the
San Francisco Chronicle's hard-hit
ling sports editor. Bill Leiser. Mis
forceful attitude toward the drastic
curtailment at which Byrnes hinted
was noticed enough to make the
pages of TIME magazine.
