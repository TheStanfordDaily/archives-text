# Cougar Squad Battles Betas
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
The powerful Roble League teams
clash again tonight with the most
crucial contest of the evening being
the Cougar-Beta tussle in the Pa
vilian at 7:15.
The Cougars are the only pos
sible team that can wrest the Roble
League crown from the hands of
the Phi Psi quintet, who edged
out the Beta five 2!)-28 in a thriller
last Tuesday. If the army group
defeats the Betas, it will be a fair
indication of their chances against
the league leaders.
The army aggregation is a one
man squad, "Red" Prescott is one
of the best forwards to come out of
either league, and he consistently
averages from 18 to 20 points per
game. Otto Sorenson will give the
Cougars the necessary height to
control rebounds, a 1 actor which al
most defeated the Phi Psi outfit
when they played the towering Betas
last week.
The talented "Red Shirts" have
such stars as Morley Thompson,
George Bower, and Ric Supple. Be
cause of their all-around ability, the
Betas should take this one by at
least three or four buckets.
The Royal Flush - Oiler game
should easily be a victory for the
Royal Flush team. Undefeated and
untested in league competition, the
favorites are also possible con
tenders for the top spot in the
Roble League.
The boy to watch in this game is
little Max Bauer, who made 13 dig
its against the Palo Alto Independ
ents when he played for the army
all-stars last week. Speed is "Max
ie's greatest asset, and he can real
ly give a great show in a fast
"ontest.
Other games of the evening are
the Med 1-Phi Psi tilt in the Encina
Gym at 7:15, and the Buchanan
Bearcats vs. Sequoia Roughs in the
Pavilion at 8:15.
