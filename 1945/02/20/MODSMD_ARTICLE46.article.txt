# Knitters To Finish Belgian Sweaters
## 
### 
Farm women are again urged to
turn in their completed sweaters
with their name attached together
with any extra wool to the War
Board office, according to Emily
Metzger, chairman.
All articles must be finished and
turned in before the end of the
quarter. "The sweaters are doing the
Belgians no good whatever, lying at
home unfinished," commented Miss
Metzger.
