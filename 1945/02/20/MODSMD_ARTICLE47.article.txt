# Fresh men Are Big Game Fire-Builders
## 
### 
Building the bonfire for the pre-
Big Game rally is a privilege in
herent among freshman classes.
Throughout the day the frosh men
stack planks, telephone poles, bar
rels in a pyramid, in preparation
for the giant conflagration; at noon
Roble women (Branner and Casa
Ventura women too) carry food
out to the laborers.
