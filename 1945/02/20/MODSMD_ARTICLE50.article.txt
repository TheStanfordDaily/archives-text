# 'Belie of the Yukon' Goes Minus; Companion Feature Flunks Out
## 
### 
BELLE OF THE YUKON — now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
There's always something so re
| freshing and purifying in a film like
"Belle of the Yukon"—one of those
pictures in which Hollywood seems

to say, "Here we ,
give you every- |
thing that's bad;
by this cleansing
rpocess we hope
to present some
thing better next
time."
As for the plot,
Randy Scott is j
seen as "Honest
John Calhoun," !
proprietor of a !

lavish Alaskan bar. Gypsy Rose Lee, I
i speaking a very silver-plated brand
| of English, appears as Scott's fea
j tured singer, dancer, and "platonic"
' friend. Also on the payroll are Bob I
i Burns with his Oakie humor and
; Dinah Shore with her honeycombed
| singing.
Everything goes wrong in "Belle
; of the Yukon." The so-called lui-

tnor backfires in every instance,
most of the cast looks terribly out
of place, and the expensive pro- j
duction numbers are a sticky com
bination of girls and gibberish.
Just for the experience of seeing
I Hollywood really off-guard, you
! might enjoy "Belle of the Yukon."
"Three Is a Family" occupies the
J second spot on the double bill and
gives the "has-beens" a chance to j
i display their talents. Charlie Rug
i gles, Fay Bainter, Helen Broderick

and a whole bunch of old-timers
creak through this frail comedy
that brings wartime living and its
problems to the fore. There are a
few enjoyable moments but you
probably won't have the patience to
wait and find them. You'd be a fool
if you did.-- -Dick Bower
