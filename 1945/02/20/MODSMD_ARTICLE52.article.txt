# Inadequate Medical Care Discussed at Health Forum
## 
### RAY WISSLER 
(Editor's note: This is a continua
tion of a review begun in Monday's
Daily.)
David Hedley of the legislative de
partment of the CIO, in speaking of
the need for more adequate distribu
tion of medical care among all groups
in California, asserted that next to
the problem of unemployment, in
adequate distribution of medical care
is one of our most pressing problems
today.
He remarked that in setting up a
sound prepaid medical service plan
we would remove doubt and uncer
tainty by putting medical expenses
into the realm of insurance. "Just as
we have unemployment insurance,
so should we have health insurance,"
he said.
Controversy Encountered
As pointed out by several of the
speakers, the most controversial dif
ference between the Thomas Bill
and Governor Warren Bill is the
method by which the doctors are
to be paid. The Thomas Bill provides
for payment of general medical care
on the capitation principle. This pro
vides that a flat fee be paid the
doctor for each patient under his
care, and this fee is paid regardless
of the amount of service of a general
medical nature rendered the patient.
For any specialist services and for
professional services other than of
a general medical nature, the fec
for-service principle is used.
Warren's Bill
Under the Warren Bill, the doctor
would be paid on the fee-for-service
principle, regardless of the type of
service rendered. According to this
principle, the doctor is paid for each
office-visit and for each individual
service rendered, in accordance with
a schedule of fees.
Mr. Hedley asserted that the capi
tation principle would make it "much
more possible to evaluate the cost of
operating a medical service plan."
He claimed that under a capitation
principle a program would be ad
ministratively much more simple,
with less paper work, regimentation
and supervision, and would be less
costly to run. He contended that a
very important advantage from the
use of the capitation principle would
be that emphasis would be placed on
the preventative aspect of medicine.
Health Is Community Problem
Senator John Shelly, Democrat,
told of co-authoring the Governor's
bill upon request of the governor.
He said that he felt that the im
portant thing is to get a bill passed,
and that afterwards it can be re
vised as necessary to make it more
workable. He said, "Health is not
an individual problem, it is a com
munity problem — a problem of
society."
"I personally favor the capitation
system because of the study I have
done on the subject. The success

ful programs — primarily in the
Scandinavian countries—usually be
gan on the fee-for-scrvice plan, but
in all cases they had to discard it
and adopt the capitation plan," said
Senator Shelly.
Criticism Given
Dr. R. Stanley Kneeshaw criticised
government medicine claiming that
it is not necessary. He questioned the
statistics that indicate lack of ade
quate medical care among the popu
lation as a whole.
"No doctors have been consulted
in the formation of either of these
two bills," Dr. Kneeshaw asserted.
He said that the medical situation
in California would not withstand
any major revision at this time, after
the years of heavy load carried by
the medical profession during the
war.
Two Questions liaised
Dr. John H. Shephard declared
that two questions would have to be
answered in formulating an opinion
on the question of any compulsory
system. "First, is a contemplated
program economically sound, and
second, will the people get more
than they are getting today?"

Two Questions liaised
Dr. John H. Shephard declared
that two questions would have to be
answered in formulating an opinion
on the question of any compulsory
system. "First, is a contemplated
program economically sound, and
second, will the people get more
than they are getting today?"
(Editor's note: This is a continua
tion of a review begun in Monday's
Daily.)
David Hedley of the legislative de
partment of the CIO, in speaking of
the need for more adequate distribu
tion of medical care among all groups
in California, asserted that next to
the problem of unemployment, in
adequate distribution of medical care
is one of our most pressing problems
today.
He remarked that in setting up a
sound prepaid medical service plan
we would remove doubt and uncer
tainty by putting medical expenses
into the realm of insurance. "Just as
we have unemployment insurance,
so should we have health insurance,"
he said.
Controversy Encountered
As pointed out by several of the
speakers, the most controversial dif
ference between the Thomas Bill
and Governor Warren Bill is the
method by which the doctors are
to be paid. The Thomas Bill provides
for payment of general medical care
on the capitation principle. This pro
vides that a flat fee be paid the
doctor for each patient under his
care, and this fee is paid regardless
of the amount of service of a general
medical nature rendered the patient.
For any specialist services and for
professional services other than of
a general medical nature, the fec
for-service principle is used.
Warren's Bill
Under the Warren Bill, the doctor
would be paid on the fee-for-service
principle, regardless of the type of
service rendered. According to this
principle, the doctor is paid for each
office-visit and for each individual
service rendered, in accordance with
a schedule of fees.
Mr. Hedley asserted that the capi
tation principle would make it "much
more possible to evaluate the cost of
operating a medical service plan."
He claimed that under a capitation
principle a program would be ad
ministratively much more simple,
with less paper work, regimentation
and supervision, and would be less
costly to run. He contended that a
very important advantage from the
use of the capitation principle would
be that emphasis would be placed on
the preventative aspect of medicine.
Health Is Community Problem
Senator John Shelly, Democrat,
told of co-authoring the Governor's
bill upon request of the governor.
He said that he felt that the im
portant thing is to get a bill passed,
and that afterwards it can be re
vised as necessary to make it more
workable. He said, "Health is not
an individual problem, it is a com
munity problem — a problem of
society."
"I personally favor the capitation
system because of the study I have
done on the subject. The success

ful programs — primarily in the
Scandinavian countries—usually be
gan on the fee-for-scrvice plan, but
in all cases they had to discard it
and adopt the capitation plan," said
Senator Shelly.
Criticism Given
Dr. R. Stanley Kneeshaw criticised
government medicine claiming that
it is not necessary. He questioned the
statistics that indicate lack of ade
quate medical care among the popu
lation as a whole.
"No doctors have been consulted
in the formation of either of these
two bills," Dr. Kneeshaw asserted.
He said that the medical situation
in California would not withstand
any major revision at this time, after
the years of heavy load carried by
the medical profession during the
war.
