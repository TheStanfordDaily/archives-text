# Quad 'Ain't Like She Usta Be,' Years Ago
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
In a rambling set of offices across
the street from the Geology Corner,
another annual edition of the Stan
ford Quad is now being assembled.
True to tradition the publication will
once again outline the main events
of another school year. Sports nat
urally will occupy a minor section
along with other activities now com
pletely or partially limited by the
war, but living groups will appear as
usual, probably in the form of in
dividual pictures. Nevertheless the
Quad will constitute an accurate and
interesting history of the year, add
ing to the long list of Quads before
it, published without a break since
1894.
Quad Ain't Like She Usta Be
But the Quad of 50 years ago was
nothing like the modern editions,
differing in many ways. Then, they
put out a much smaller volume, and
less elaborate than our present ones.
Also of interest to us now was the
apparent lack of women's pictures;
women hardly appearing at all in
drawings or cartoons, and not in
group pictures for about 10 years.
The photography of the day in
cluded pictures such as the Women's
Mandolin Club, in which the mem
bers appeared to be at least 40;
but the men's swimming teams were
the most striking. Imagine striped
sleeves and trunks down to the
knees. There were pictures of the
girl's fencing teams. It. seemed as
if everyone in those days always
had to get dressed up and pose for
the camera, and the informal cam
pus gatherings looked more like

funerals than picnics or meetings
with all the top hats, parasols, etc.
•IMelodrainie'
Now and then one of these ancient
Quads would turn out a cowboy
story of the dime novel quality. From
the literary section of the 1905 Quad
comes a pr i z e-winning, drama
packed, tale of love and disappoint
ment. Quoting fro m "Ryerson's
Annie" . . .
"At last, therefore, there came
from headquarters an order to build
the water-saving dams. Ryerson's
Anne, living some hundred miles and
more out, heard the news quietly.
'When'll they get here?' she asked.
'Long about August, Jim thinks,'
answered her father. 'And the big
gest dam they'll build's going to be
right nearby here!'
'Tat's good,' said the girl . .
The old Quads were filled with
apparently pointless jokes, although
they were probably funny a couple
of decades ago. Here's a fairly typi
cal gag:
"Professor Little: That will not
do, Mr. Allen. The problem is not
right.
Allen: But Professor, it satisfies
the equation.
Professor Little: Huh, it don't
satisfy me. . . "
Boy. Are We Travelin'
The old cars were undoubtedly a
terrific sight roaring along at 15
miles an hour which real speed, al
though it's safe to suppose some wild
drivers occasionally hit 20 on Palm
Drive.
None of this is meant to be a
slander of the times, of course, but
merely a comparison with our own
college days . . .

the street from the Geology Corner,
another annual edition of the Stan
ford Quad is now being assembled.
True to tradition the publication will
once again outline the main events
of another school year. Sports nat
urally will occupy a minor section
along with other activities now com
pletely or partially limited by the
war, but living groups will appear as
usual, probably in the form of in
dividual pictures. Nevertheless the
Quad will constitute an accurate and
interesting history of the year, add
ing to the long list of Quads before
it, published without a break since
1894.
Quad Ain't Like She Usta Be
But the Quad of 50 years ago was
nothing like the modern editions,
differing in many ways. Then, they
put out a much smaller volume, and
less elaborate than our present ones.
Also of interest to us now was the
apparent lack of women's pictures;
women hardly appearing at all in
drawings or cartoons, and not in
group pictures for about 10 years.
The photography of the day in
cluded pictures such as the Women's
Mandolin Club, in which the mem
bers appeared to be at least 40;
but the men's swimming teams were
the most striking. Imagine striped
sleeves and trunks down to the
knees. There were pictures of the
girl's fencing teams. It. seemed as
if everyone in those days always
had to get dressed up and pose for
the camera, and the informal cam
pus gatherings looked more like

funerals than picnics or meetings
with all the top hats, parasols, etc.
•IMelodrainie'
Now and then one of these ancient
Quads would turn out a cowboy
story of the dime novel quality. From
the literary section of the 1905 Quad
comes a pr i z e-winning, drama
packed, tale of love and disappoint
ment. Quoting fro m "Ryerson's
Annie" . . .
"At last, therefore, there came
from headquarters an order to build
the water-saving dams. Ryerson's
Anne, living some hundred miles and
more out, heard the news quietly.
'When'll they get here?' she asked.
'Long about August, Jim thinks,'
answered her father. 'And the big
gest dam they'll build's going to be
right nearby here!'
'Tat's good,' said the girl . .
The old Quads were filled with
apparently pointless jokes, although
they were probably funny a couple
of decades ago. Here's a fairly typi
cal gag:
"Professor Little: That will not
do, Mr. Allen. The problem is not
right.
Allen: But Professor, it satisfies
the equation.
Professor Little: Huh, it don't
satisfy me. . . "
Boy. Are We Travelin'
The old cars were undoubtedly a
terrific sight roaring along at 15
miles an hour which real speed, al
though it's safe to suppose some wild
drivers occasionally hit 20 on Palm
Drive.
None of this is meant to be a
slander of the times, of course, but
merely a comparison with our own
college days . . .
