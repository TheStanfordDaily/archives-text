closed today.
The end of the 17-day-old battle j
of Manila was in sight.
South of the Pasig River in Ma

around the Intramuros, or the old i
walled city. American big guns were j
reported blasting its thick and an- j
cient walls in preparation for a final {
assault on the enemy garrison.
The enemy pocket now comprises :
about one-fourteenth of the char- j
tered city area, and Maj. Gen. Rob- !
ert. S. Beighler's 37th Division troops ;
were cutting it down in bitter fight- !
ing. The 37th had pressed westward
from the Philippines General Hos- 1
pital to the bay front and was at- |
tacking enemy positions at the Uni- j
versity of the Philippines, south of !
the Intramuros.
