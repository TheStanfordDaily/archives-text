# Grad Describes Marianas, Hawaii
## 
### CONNIE McGILLICUDDY 
Life in the Marianas and experiences en route were described by Second
Lieutenant Elizabeth Cook, Stanford graduate of 1943, in a letter received
here.
Lieutenant Cook is a physical therapist in the Army Medical Corps. I
She writes in her letter, "We stopped at Oahu for a week. What fun that

was, for the usual restrictions were'
lifted and we were permitted to go
ashore during the days.
Sees Pearl Harbor
I have a Korean friend whom I
met at Reed College and she took
me sightseeing. To get to her home,
which is 22 miles from Honolulu, I
saw much of the country, including
Pearl Harbor. My friend drove me
I through the Dole pineapple field
| where we picked six large, juicy
j pineapples; took me to a Korean
j wedding reception where we kissed
the groom as is their custom and
ate Korean food with chopsticks;
drove me through the country where
I saw the most beautiful scenery and
flowers I have ever seen; drove me
through the University of Hawaii
campus; and took me to Waikiki
Beach just at sunset. I really had
a wonderful time and every day I
went swimming and surf board rid
ing at Waikiki and some days took
long bus rides. After a week's stop
we set out again . . . Finally we
arrived at our destination—one of
the Mariana Islands.
'American Women, Wow!'
'A convoy of army trucks trans
ported us across the island to our
new home. We passed through the
largest city on the island which is
now nothing but wreckage. The
buildings were bombed to the ground
and scarcely a dwelling was left
standing. While on this ride we had
a good time waving to the natives
and our G.l.'s', Everyone welcomed
us with cheers and the G.l.'s yelled,
"American women, wow!"
"We live in tents having wooden
floors and burlap and screen on the
sides. Our area is surrounded by a
high fence and guards for there are
still Jap snipers on this island. Since
we are not allowed out of our area,
which is very much smaller than
the main part of the Stanford cam
pus, our scenery is very limited. We
| can see the jungles from a short dis-
J tance, many cocoanut palm trees,
tents everywhere, and white coral
and mud. I find it quite hot here but
this is the cool season, and, though
it usually rains every day and some
times much oftcner, this is the dry
season. So it looks as though we
: have some strange weather ahead.
| Hot Dogs, Too!
"I wish you could see the present
] P.T. dept. The chief of medicial serv
! ices pointed out an area of ground
| and provided me with a tent. We
J cleared the ground of brush, had a
! truck load of coral hauled in to
I cover the ground, found sides of
! large boxes which held the electric
generators to use as a floor, and
J then put up the tent provided which
j is just a little larger than a pup-tent,
j Everyone called it "Cookie's hot dog
; stand" at first.
"I'm really enjoying my work here,
j I'm on my own but yet have the

advantage of an orthopedic chief who
believes in physical therapy."
Dream of Drugstores
Lieutenant Cook writes that her
hours are from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
For recreation there are outdoor
movies. "We carry benches or boards
to sit on, put on mosquito repellent,
and carry a raincoat." There's not
much time, she says, for more than
"working, sleeping, writing letters
and going to movies." Almost wist
fully Lieutenant Cook tells of dream
ing of "such things as drugstores
with cold cokes, milk shakes, city
lights, our friends, etc."

Sees Pearl Harbor
I have a Korean friend whom I
met at Reed College and she took
me sightseeing. To get to her home,
which is 22 miles from Honolulu, I
saw much of the country, including
Pearl Harbor. My friend drove me
I through the Dole pineapple field

j pineapples; took me to a Korean
j wedding reception where we kissed
the groom as is their custom and
ate Korean food with chopsticks;
drove me through the country where
I saw the most beautiful scenery and
flowers I have ever seen; drove me
through the University of Hawaii
campus; and took me to Waikiki
Beach just at sunset. I really had
a wonderful time and every day I
went swimming and surf board rid
ing at Waikiki and some days took
long bus rides. After a week's stop
we set out again . . . Finally we
