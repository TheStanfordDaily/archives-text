# Girls Vote On Petitions
## 
### 
J. D. Williams, Lower Division
i member of Excom, asked house
i presidents at Women's Conference
j yesterday afternoon to take a vote
in their houses last night on the
[ question, "should nominating com
mittee be abolished and a system of
nominating by petition only be es
tablished that would extend over a
I two-day period with publication of
! nominees at the end of the first day."
Excom will take the issue up again
at their meeting Wednesday night
in the light of what the campus as a
whole thinks about the proposal.
Functions of Nominating Committee
According to Williams, the func-
I tions of nominating committee arc
j to fill out the ballot, making sure
there are enough students running
, for every office, and to give advice
to students interested in running
j but unsure of what office they would
j be qualified to run for.
Some of the members of Excom
i feel that the Nominating Committee
i is undemocratic because it allows for
a small group of students to judge
; in 5 minutes or so the qualifications
; of a student who conies before it.
Williams thought that the petition
! system alone would work if a pro
â–  gram of leadership education were
; given before each election. He urged
I students to think about the matter
' and present any new suggestions to
! Excom which meets Wednesday
! night.
j Entertainment for Servicemen
Miss Irma Jean Hannibal, secre
; tary to Dean Mary Yost and worker
1 in the Red Cross Recreational Corps
at Dibble General Hospital for one
j year, spoke to Conference about en-
I tertainment for the wounded service
i men there. Students are invited to
j go to Dibble and visit the men or
; help entertain them in the Recre
ational room. Saturday and Sunday
i nights are the best nights to visit
i the boys. Those who want to have
: boys out to their living groups for
a party arc asked to go out and meet
j some of the boys first, and then
phone the boy and ask him and some
of his friends to the party.
The blind boys have passes every
! night and love to have visitors or
! come out to the campus. Visiting
| hours are from 2 to 4 p.m. and 6 to
| 9 p.m. Any group of girls wishing
to entertain a group of boys, blind
i or other vise at a party, should phone
Lucy Vance, social chairman of the
I War Board.
j Late I,eave Report Next Week
The 2 a.m. late leave committee
plans to submit a report next week
; at Conference for voting. They will
hold a meeting sometime this week
