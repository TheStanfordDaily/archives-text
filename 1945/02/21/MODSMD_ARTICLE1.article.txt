# Pow-wow Promises Big Hit Show from Twenty-nine Entries!
## All Original Productions Have Music, Varied Plots 
### 
With the close of the entry period for the
all-campus competitive Pow-Wow Monday at
midnight, 29 campus groups had declared
themselves in the running for three Ram's Head
prizes, and were already in the process of vig
orous composition and rehearsal for presenta
tion March 2.
Lathrop is already working up harmony on
its original song—the only one declared among
entries. Musical in its theme also is the skit of
Hurlburt House but agents from said organi
zation would not divulge its plot.
"Life at Madrono" was the theme selected
by Madrono, and Chairman Jody LeMay told
us frankly that the possibilities were limitless.
In describing it she said, "Just a general mad

house. Nearly everyone in Madrono is in it
. . . lots of talent."
Casa Eucalypto has dreamed up a take-off
on one of the art gallery's favorite classes.
Adelfa will present a sparkling interpretation
of the freshman hygiene assembly, according
to its chairmen, Pat Nielsen and Ann Smith.
Naranja's rehearsals of "The Highwayman" are
progressing verse by verse.
The Chalet entered under the tentative title
of "pony ballet." A Rag-versus-Mag competi
tion will rage on the stage, as the two literary
squads from the Daily and the Chaparral drama
tize life on and off the Farm.
The Daily group will produce an uplifting
and refreshing skit on printing a campus news
paper, according to its authors.

Perpetrators of the show, Cardinals, will also
present a skit—as yet unwritten and unnamed,
but definitely in the running for the awards be
ing presented by the show sponsors, Ram's
Head, for the best done, most original and fun
niest skit.
Upholding the honor of the masculine en
trants will be Washington's male quartet, and
men from Toyon presenting a take-off on Life
magazine.
Other entrants are as follows:
Casa Ventura, Jordan, Union Residence, Bian
ner, Manzanita, Juniper, Olivo, Redwoods, and
two Roble groups.
Union Unit, the Oaks, Casa Granada, Haw
thorne, Magnolia, Storey House, and Sequoia.
Reminders to the entrants:

No skit is to bo over eight minutes in dura
tion—otherwise there will not be time for the
Chaparral skit.
Costumes and props will be limited to those
which can be carried on and off-stage by the
players.
Rehearsals in the Memorial Auditorium, may
be arranged by phoning Mary Lou Pttton at
Jessie Jordan House.
Judges will be made up of members of Car
dinals and Ram's Head, according to Peggy
Fitts, chairman of the show. Designed for all
campus participation, the Pow-Wow may be
come a traditional winter-quarter show under
Ram's Head sponsorship.
Chairmen of each group will receive points
toward membership in Ram's Head.
