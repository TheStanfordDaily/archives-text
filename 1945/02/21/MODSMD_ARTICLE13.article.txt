# Two-week Red Cross Drive Starts Monday
## 
### 
With a goal set at $3,000, Stanford's annual Red Cross drive will start
Monday, Feb. 2(i, announced Chairman Charmian Kolar yesterday. The
drive will last for two weeks, until March 10, and Miss Kolar asked every
student to contribute at least $2 so that Stanford may more than till its
pledge to help this vital part of the war effort.
Heading the committees for this drive, one of Stanford's three drives

of the school year, arc Jack Sicmer, *
men's collections; Gloria Cassidy, j
women's collections; Beth van Hoe
sen, posters; and Gcorgean Lightner,
in charge of window display.
Key participants in the solicita
tions for I?ed Cross funds, however,
are the Red Cross representatives of
the various living groups. Materials
necessary for the collections will be
given out Friday afternoon from 4:30
to 5:30 in the Excom room, and all
representatives or their substitutes
must be present to get these mate
rials, said Miss Kolar, and to re
ceive instructions as to their duties.
If any living group is unable to send I
a representative Friday, Miss Kolar j
will be in the A.S.S.U. office Monday
morning to receive the late-comers. |
"There are two things Stanford !
students can give that don't take i
time from their studies," said Miss !
Kolar. "One is blood, and the other
is money. The Red Cross needs $0
per second to run its organization i
throughout the world; and of this i
enormous group, there are only two |

â™¦
! paid workers to every !500 volun
teers."
As an example of the way the I?od
Cross spends its money, Miss Kolar
added that every capture kit sent to
our prisoners of war in enemy na
tions cost $20. These capture kits
contain pajamas, socks, underwear,
and other personal comfort items,
and arc sent to new prisoners. In
addition the Red Cross prisoner of
war service sends food parcels
weekly for distribution to prisoners
in Europe, medicine kits, clothing,
and the "Red Cross News" with
comics, sports news, home items, and
I other special articles of interest to
[ American servicemen imprisoned by
| the enemy.
Stanford's contribution to this
I fund will include only the students'
! gifts. Stanford faculty and admin
istration officials will be solicited by
! the Palo Alto Red Cross, in conjunc
tion with their drive which begins
March 2. said Miss Kolar. The Palo
i Alto area quota has been set at $75,-
i 000 toward the national 200 million
I dollar goal.
