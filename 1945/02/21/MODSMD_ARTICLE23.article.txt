# Dr. Tresidder Tells Assembly Of Stanford Way of Life'
## 
### 
Tracing the founding and early
history of the Farm and describing
the heritage of Stanford men and
women today, Dr. Tresidder, in his
speech to yesterday's Tradition Day
assembly, urged students to base
their years at Stanford on the de
termination to participate in activi
ties which will best fortify them
for the future problems they must
face—not to be wholly concerned
with the bookkeeping of credits,
units, and grade points.
Dr. Tresidder, introduced by ASSU
President Barbara White as the
"greatest keeper of our hello tradi
tion," started off the hour-long as
sembly which featured band selec
tions and various songs by the
student-faculty chorus.
Sober Times
"The times arc sober . . . there
arc things to be done that we aren't
doing." Student government in oper
ation on this campus, he said, had
all the handicaps and advantages of
any self-governing people. It. must
compote against indifference on the
part of many, and the complaints of
many others, who although dissatis
fied, are unwilling to cooperate with
their student officers in an attempt
to achieve something better.
In illustration of his theme—''Stan
ford is not just an institution, but
a way of life"—-he said that this uni
versity had been founded upon the
discontent of Governor and Mrs.
Stanford, who believed that no uni
versity in this country or abroad had
fully developed the possibilities in
herent in such an institution.
Sought a Leader
Striking at perfection, the Stan
fords canvassed the country for a
leader, interested and capable, who
would become Stanford's first presi
dent. David Starr Jordan, who re
ceived and accepted the offer with
in an hour, in turn selected faculty
members with "extraordinary wis
dom," providing Stanford with a
staff of scholars which has never
been depleted.
Dr. Tresidder related the experi
ences of two of his friends,—he called
them Jim and George—their first
encounter with the hello tradition,
their friendship with Dr. Jordan,
and the lesson in justice they learned
when Jim was accused of stealing
goods found in his locker, and the
professor quelled the accusations of
the students around him by say
ing, "Wait a moment. We haven't
yet asked him if he took these
things."
Musical Program
Highlight of the musical program
planned by Dede Bergerot was the
enthusiastic rendition of "Son of a
Gambolicr," starring Dr. Bayard Q.
Morgan and his rooter's cap, Profes
sor Max Savelle, and Johnny High.
The assembly, organized by Cardi
nal member Carol Hurwilz. was the
official opening of Tradition Day.
