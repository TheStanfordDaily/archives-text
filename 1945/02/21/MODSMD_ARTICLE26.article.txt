# 'No Good Germans Left,' Says Van Walt at Tuesday Series
## 
### 
"The greatest achievement Hitler
has accomplished has been to turn
Germany into a nation of paranoics
—from a nation of men, \vomcn, and
children into a nation of dangerous
neurotics," said Dr. Harry P. van
Walt last night in his Tuesday Eve
ning Series address, "The Road to
Berlin."
He said that lie has noticed in
America and England a tendency to
differentiate between the Nazis and
the "good Germans." "There are no
more good Germans now," he em
phasized. "We must not lose sight of
the fact that the Hitler phobia is
not merely a veneration for the
German Reich—it has become a re
ligion in Germany. Hitler is the
'saviour' of the German people; he
is their Christ."
'Christ Complex'
Dr. van Walt added that Hitler
shared the opinion of the German
people. "He has what psychologists
call a 'Christ complex.' He firmly
believes that he has a mission to
perform on this earth."
Wishful Thinking
Speaking of our progress in the
war, Dr. van Walt said that "the
American and British press enter
tain too much wishful thinking about
the Siegfried line ... it is not a
wall, hut is a series of defenses that
extend from 20 to . r >o miles inside
Germany. Do not, therefore, become
over-optimistic when we read th;it
American troops have penetrated 18
miles beyond the Siegfried line."
He added "but we should keep our
eye on what Montgomery is ac
complishing. If he succeeds in turn
ing the west wall then victory is in
sight."
Little Hope
As the situation is now, Dr. van
Walt held out little hope that the
war with Germany will see Allied
victory within the next few months.
Instead he offered the expectation
that the European war will continue
for at least another year.
He predicted that the Russians
would get to Berlin first, and that
they would advance to the west, and
hem the Germans in between the
Americans in the west and the Rus
sians in die cast.
This would not bode too much
good for the peace table, he said,
because "it would give the Russians
the greatest credit, and Stalin the
greatest say when the peace is de
cided."
He warned, however, against mini

mizing the efforts and achievement:,
of the Russian Army. "I hav« noticed
a certain suspicion against the Rus
sians, not only in America, but in
England, France, and among my
own countrymen in Holland. I, too,
fear Communism; I fear Communism
! everywhere but in Russia."
"But there is a great difference
j between Lenin Communism and
j Stalin Communism," he added, "and
! though you and I would not like it,
| to the Russians it is heaven com
i pared to Czarist Russia.
"The Russian is today a happy
! man. We have no right to bo as sus
i pieious of him as we are. After all,
I lots of Russians are turning bad
j Germans into good Germans every
J day."
Stalin's Plan
lie told of Stalin's plan to educate
captured German officers for gov
: eminent of Germany after the war,
and praised President Roosevelt for
not allowing this plan to go through.
He said, "no German must be al
{ lowed to rule Germany after the war.
■ They will only plan, as they did in
1918, another war to defeat the
j Allies."
He said that we cannot hope to
| educate Germany to Democracy
