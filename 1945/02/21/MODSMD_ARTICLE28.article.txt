# WELL, WHY DON'T WE?

Despite the publicity that seemed to miss
fire, and a generally bewildered student atti
tude, "the 20th" went over very well and left
everyone saying, "why don't we do this more
often?"
It's true that all the predictions of what
campus-get-iogeth. rs can do for our feeling for
Stanford as a group seldom really impress us
until we see it happen.
The success of the assembly was due, un
fortunately, to a small group of people; Dr.
Tresidder, of course; the members of the fac
ulty and students who performed and attended;
Carol Hurwitz, Cardinals member who bore the
full brunt of the initial tribulations; Dr. Popper
who has never been known to refuse Stanford
students a request to pull flagging Stanford so
cial graces up by their boot-straps; that won
derful band under its new director, Mr. Curtis.
To the people who painted the posters, set
up the chairs, hung the pennant, and took it
down again, our thanks, there are not enough
like you on this campus.
The assembly was evidence that when we
get acclimated on such a rare occasion, there is
plenty of Stanford spirit that is vocal when there
is an opportunity to shout or sing about it—
together.
We should hop to the opportunity that pre
sented itself and not accept the usual reasons
why they are so rare. Why not take advantage
of evenings, if classes are disturbed, why not
let more than one or two groups get into these
tilings, and offer to get into them, why not have
more entertainment come from the students in
stead of always being dependent on the fac
ulty to pull us through?
Why not start with the remaining all-campus
functions for the quarter? The Pow-wow is
starting its program with plenty of skits; don't
let all the work on your house's skit fall to a
few. Pull some duration-mopers into it.
The W.A.A. is lining up class participation
and living group for a big outdoor sports-en
tertainment session in March. It too can do a tre
mendous amount to make these war years more
than just "too bad."
