# INDIRECTLY DIRECT
## ELECTING EXCOM INDIRECTLY 
### 
When considering present proposals to
change the basis of representation on Excom
from a class to living group system, it is neces
sary to remember that the essential value for
the proposed plan is not only to have a better
distribution of the student officers throughout
the student body, but also to bind together as
a functioning unit the various levels of student
government hierarchy.
A plan to have members of Excom come
from living units works out in practice to re
quire 11 members; one each from the Union
unit, Lagunita, The Row, Branner-Roble-Ven
tura frosh unit, the Toyon-Tyler-Buchanan frosh
unit, Men's halls, the Encina Army unit, off-cam
pus students, an l graduate students, plus a pres
ident and vice-president, alone to be elected in
general election.
Both the plan under consideration by Excom
and the plan being written for the new consti
tution, provide that these members shall not
come from a direct election within the unit but
shall be elected by the house presidents within
the unit.
There are definite reasons why this is pro
vided for at the risk of sacrificing more direct
elections.
rirr-t, is that the essential problem of student
'•ovornment has been and is communication be

tween the student and the top student officers.
Some way must be sought to make the link be
tween the officer and his responsibility realized.
In the first place, it is the only way to have
effective government; secondly, it is the only
way to get most thoughtful and active people
to care enough about their government to take
part.
To have house presidents of a unit elect the
Excom member from the unit semes to be an
effective way to place responsibility with house
presidents to report the actions of:
1. That member to the people of their
living group.
2. To insure the election of capable house
presidents to measure up to such a respon
sibility.
3. To have a direct responsibility placed
on someone to take student ideas and prob
lems to the chief student officers.
This way the link between the individual
student and his Excom officer is more obvious
and more easily workable.
A point that is debatable is whether or not
the Excom members should come from among
the house presidents or be nominated by them
from the students within the unit. That they
be elected by the presidents in either case how
ever, essential to making their office a
vital part of student government, placing a re
sponsibility for the actions of executive com
mittee, and having a medium by which the stu
dents can make their opinions known and con
sidered.
It is true that this proposal would increase
the work of the house president, besides their
announcements from conference and considera
tion of its law-making responsibilities, they
would have the facts and responsibility to make
the house-meeting a part of student government.
Actually it would only require that at the
unit's regular Excom meeting they also con
sider the problems of student government.
The primary purpose would be to effect a
student government whose work would be clear
to the individual student.
He must realize the problem's of the student
body and have the interest and confidence to
help solve them. We cannot change the student
attitude unless we change the machinery, and
it is not worthwhile changing it unless we have
some results in mind.

ever, essential to making their office a
vital part of student government, placing a re
sponsibility for the actions of executive com
mittee, and having a medium by which the stu
dents can make their opinions known and con
sidered.
It is true that this proposal would increase
the work of the house president, besides their
announcements from conference and considera
tion of its law-making responsibilities, they
would have the facts and responsibility to make
the house-meeting a part of student government.
Actually it would only require that at the
unit's regular Excom meeting they also con
sider the problems of student government.
The primary purpose would be to effect a
student government whose work would be clear
to the individual student.
He must realize the problem's of the student
body and have the interest and confidence to
help solve them. We cannot change the student
attitude unless we change the machinery, and
it is not worthwhile changing it unless we have
some results in mind.
When considering present proposals to
change the basis of representation on Excom
from a class to living group system, it is neces
sary to remember that the essential value for
the proposed plan is not only to have a better
distribution of the student officers throughout
the student body, but also to bind together as
a functioning unit the various levels of student
government hierarchy.
A plan to have members of Excom come
from living units works out in practice to re
quire 11 members; one each from the Union
unit, Lagunita, The Row, Branner-Roble-Ven
tura frosh unit, the Toyon-Tyler-Buchanan frosh
unit, Men's halls, the Encina Army unit, off-cam
pus students, an l graduate students, plus a pres
ident and vice-president, alone to be elected in
general election.
Both the plan under consideration by Excom
and the plan being written for the new consti
tution, provide that these members shall not
come from a direct election within the unit but
shall be elected by the house presidents within
the unit.
There are definite reasons why this is pro
vided for at the risk of sacrificing more direct
elections.
rirr-t, is that the essential problem of student
'•ovornment has been and is communication be

tween the student and the top student officers.
Some way must be sought to make the link be
tween the officer and his responsibility realized.
In the first place, it is the only way to have
effective government; secondly, it is the only
way to get most thoughtful and active people
to care enough about their government to take
part.
To have house presidents of a unit elect the
Excom member from the unit semes to be an
effective way to place responsibility with house
presidents to report the actions of:
1. That member to the people of their
living group.
2. To insure the election of capable house
presidents to measure up to such a respon
sibility.
3. To have a direct responsibility placed
on someone to take student ideas and prob
lems to the chief student officers.
This way the link between the individual
student and his Excom officer is more obvious
and more easily workable.
A point that is debatable is whether or not
the Excom members should come from among
the house presidents or be nominated by them
from the students within the unit. That they
be elected by the presidents in either case how
ever, essential to making their office a
vital part of student government, placing a re
sponsibility for the actions of executive com
mittee, and having a medium by which the stu
