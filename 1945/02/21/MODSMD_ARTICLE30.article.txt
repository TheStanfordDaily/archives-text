San Francisco has become the focus of world
interest, as on April 25, the United Nations'
Conference, one of the most significant events
of the war, will occur there.
Their purpose will be the drafting of an in
ternational peace organization to prevent future
wars between the great as well as small powers
of the world.
It is exceedingly important for us that San
Francisco has been chosen as the site of this
conference, because this city, the main port of
the Pacific, will be strategically located in the
postwar world.
We students find ourselves adjacent to a
site which has become a symbol of hope.
No longer must we feel that the events of
the last five years lie remote from us as th.-;
most notable of all events occurs at our door
step.
Three years ago when the Japanese bombed
Pearl Harbor, the war did come ominously close
to Stanford, and indeed our own vicinity might
have been attacked. Soon though the Japanese
were halted in their march of conguest through
the Pacific and were driven back to their own
coasts.
Then we began to feel secure and perhaps
somewhat smug, for the war seemed a far off
event, consisting impersonally of interesting
news broadcasts.
But now the war returns to us in form of a
vital peace conference and while this event
seems not as moving as the threat of bombs,
it is nevertheless a great crisis of world peace,
and upon its success or failure depends the
threat of bombs in the future.—Ted Drenton.
