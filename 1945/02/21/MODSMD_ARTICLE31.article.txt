It has come to our attention that certain campus
skeptics and intelligentia have been spreading rumors
that the Jun-i-or Thunder Riders really do not exist.
Another rumor- -equally fantastic—is that the Jun-i
-or Thunder Riders, who so readily volunteer their
Cellar and Libe-Timc to ride TO THE RESCUE, never
have existed.
To these non-believers we offer proof.

Have you been in the reading room of the Main Libe
lately . . . maybe to rephrase the Britannica, which, as
it now stands would give you an low B on that term
paper? If you have, and even if you haven't, the lights
there give evidence of the work of the Thunder Riders.
Yes, the blackout bonnets have disappeared mys
teriously, making it possible for "footsie fans" to
practice their art under direct, instead of the indirect
lighting. Who but the Thunder Riders would use up
"emergency floaters" in coming to the aid of fellow
students.
But, it is only fair to tell the campus what new
service these beige bonnets are to have.
Because of their intricate design and exotic color
scheme, these lights covers will be seen in the best
places on the best heads of the Riders. They are oh-so
proud of their helmets, which complete the regulation
uniform of cloak and cleats.
A few of the more original Jun-i-ors are planning
an article for The Daily Fashion Edition the end of
this quarter. This article will describe "Motifs for Rider
Rooms" and the decorations will accentuate the positive
of their new beige helmets.
Riders—we tip our helmets to you.
