# Director of Union Unit Says Job Is Interesting
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
"I do a little bit of everything," 1
Miss Mary Jane Donaldson, director
of Union Unit, said. "That's what ;
makes my job so interesting and ex- I
citing."
Miss Donaldson has been director |
of the Unit since last fall. Last year 1
she was assistant director of Lagu- !
nita. She was graduated from
Scripps College in 1939 after major
ing in French Literature. Then she
acted as dramatic director at Scripps '
and became assistant director of 1
Monticello College for women in Il
linois after that position.
Came to Farm in '41
She came to Stanford in 1941 to
take graduate work and obtain her |
master's degree in Education. Dur
ing that time she was resident as
sistant at Mariposa artd Madrono.
Miss Donaldson has charge of the |
housekeeping and maintenance of all
the houses in Union Unit. She is !
also the resident assistant for the 71
people who live in Union Residence.
"I knew a lot of the people in the j
Unit when I came here, but it has |
been very exciting to meet the new !
people and to work with the student ;
officers," she said. "The Unit has i
grown a great deal since two new I
houses, Juniper and Redwoods, have
been added."
She acts in an advisory capacity
to committees and student govern
ment and works with the resident
assistants in co-ordinating and ad
vising all the houses.
Miss Donaldson has always been
interested in student government
and was secretary one year and
president the next of the student
body at Scripps. "Stanford's gov
ernment is built on the same basic
standards as Scripps'," she said.
Born in South
Although she was born in New
Orleans, Miss Donaldson considers
California her home because she has
lived in Los Angeles most of her life.

In her spare time she likes to play
golf and enjoys all outdoor sports.
"I don't have much time for this,
however," she remarked. "I also like
to sneak off to San Francisco for
cultural events whenever I can, and
I enjoy going to events on campus."
"My job is really my recreation
too," she said, "for there are always
so many things to do. There's no
question of ever being bored or get
ling in a rut.
"Since the war, there has been a
greater emphasis on the University
and the campus than before. There
has been a gradual growth and de
velopment of this. Students are
looking closer to home and using the
academic and other activity oppor
tunities we have here, I've noticed."
Union Is Center
"People seem to think that Union
is the place to call to find out infor
mation on almost anything," she
said. "We get telephone calls about
anything from the measurement of
drapes for the Music Listening Room
to finding someone to take care of
children or making a reservation for
luncheon."
Miss Donaldson has found that her
experience at Lagunita last year has
been very valuable to her in her
work as director of the Unit. "The
basic principles are the same."

"I knew a lot of the people in the j
Unit when I came here, but it has |
been very exciting to meet the new !
people and to work with the student ;
officers," she said. "The Unit has i
grown a great deal since two new I
houses, Juniper and Redwoods, have
been added."
She acts in an advisory capacity
to committees and student govern
ment and works with the resident
assistants in co-ordinating and ad
vising all the houses.

Born in South

Orleans, Miss Donaldson considers
California her home because she has
lived in Los Angeles most of her life.

In her spare time she likes to play
golf and enjoys all outdoor sports.
"I don't have much time for this,
however," she remarked. "I also like
to sneak off to San Francisco for
cultural events whenever I can, and
I enjoy going to events on campus."
"My job is really my recreation
too," she said, "for there are always
so many things to do. There's no
question of ever being bored or get
ling in a rut.
"Since the war, there has been a
greater emphasis on the University
and the campus than before. There
has been a gradual growth and de
velopment of this. Students are
looking closer to home and using the
academic and other activity oppor
tunities we have here, I've noticed."
Union Is Center
"People seem to think that Union
is the place to call to find out infor
mation on almost anything," she
said. "We get telephone calls about
anything from the measurement of
drapes for the Music Listening Room
to finding someone to take care of
children or making a reservation for
luncheon."
Miss Donaldson has found that her
experience at Lagunita last year has
been very valuable to her in her
work as director of the Unit. "The
basic principles are the same."
