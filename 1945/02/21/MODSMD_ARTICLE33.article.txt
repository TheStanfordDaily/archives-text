# Propaganda Is Exhibited

### ELLEN O'MEARA 
As you walk into the Hoover Li
brary, turn right at the first door,
and you will come upon one of the
most interesting exhibits on cam
pus, one which because of its nov
elty will fascinate the most hard
ened sight-seer.
We here at Stanford are rather
removed from the war in its more
realistic aspects, but the propaganda
leaflets now being exhibited at the
Hoover War Library bring the seri
ousness of the struggle very close
to uj;.
The material for these exhibits is
derived entirely from gifts: from the
United States government and from
friends of Stanford who turn their
material over to the library. Mr.
Philip McLean, in charge of the ex
hibits, selects the pamphlets which
he thinks should be of the most in
terest to the public, and decides the
length of time that each exhibit
should be shown.
Allied Leaflets Distributed
The present exhibition, which has
been here for over a month, consists
mostly of Allied leaflets that have
been put out by the Office of War
Information, Bureau of Psychologi
cal Warfare, and which have been
dropped by the millions on enemy
soldiers and civilians in enemy ter
ritories.
These American propaganda leaf
lets are masterpieces of persuasion,
employing a variety of psychological
approaches. Some are stern warn
ings; some, equally stern orders of
surrender "or else"; other leaflets
appeal to the sentimental side of the
enemy soldier, recalling to his wan
ing imagination pictures of his wife,
children, and the home he loves.
Sentiment Emphasized
Still appealing to the soft side of
the enemy, some of these leaflets cite
tr-.gic examples of lost battles, un
necessary deaths, and urge the sol
dier to surrender.
Part of the exhibition consists of
contrasting German and American
propaganda, the German pamphlets
directed at American forces, and
vice-versa. Among some very con
vincing leaflets dropped over Ger
man lines in Normandy in the sum
mer of 1944 is a "safe conduct" pass,
guaranteeing good treatment to any
enemy soldier who gives himself up.
German Propaganda Amusing
German propaganda is still far
short of perfection; the Nazis' at
tempts to influence American sol
diers are no doubt a source of great
amusement to the G.l.'s who receive
them. Besides using an excess of
supposedly common slang, these
German pamphlets abound in mis
spelling; one amazing piece of typi
cal German propaganda is a picture
of a lovely girl holding a telephone;
beneath the picture is the legend:
"Will you ever hear her sweet voice
again?"
