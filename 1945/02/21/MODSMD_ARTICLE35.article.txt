# OUR HASHER

### JOE SHER 
"Thursday to be a holiday": these
words are going the round of cam
pus and Stanford students gloat at
the thought of being able to stay
out of classes without a cut being
credited against them, a chance to
catch up on neglected studies, an
oasis in the schedule of classes, Cel
lar time and the thousands of other
important problems which plague
the average student.
These thoughts are mostly the re
sults of overactive thyroid and hash
ish upon the part of Farm inmates,
for what will undoubtedly happen is
that all will sleep until noon, then
get up and go down to lunch, lounge
around until someone with wheels
can go out to the country to enjoy
the advantages of nature, or play
golf or some other exhausting sport.
The books will gather their daily
coat of dust and the lake more than
its quota of students, while the libes
stand as open and neglected oases of
knowledge in the vast wilderness of
ignorance which surrounds the mind
Of the average student on a holiday.
Professors will sigh with relief
at the thought of having one day off
from trying to pound knowledge into
the skulls of the inmates of this fair
institution and putter through their
gardens or play that game of golf
they have been contemplating for
weeks and their wives will get a
chance to say hello to them in the
light of day instead of the dark hours
of the afternoon in which they usu
ally get home.
The Quad will get a respite from
cigarette smoke and the screech of
bicycle brakes as cautious students
hop off, having just spied one of the
local gendarmes in hot pursuit of
them.
In an interview with Griswold
Drypellet this morning we obtained
the reaction of a typical student to
the holiday. He said, "Thay, I am
awfully thorry that the school is
closed for I just had tons of work
to do, and I am going to miss my
classes tho much." We thanked
Griswold heartily and hoped he
would not knock down any low-fly
ing birds as he fluttered off across
the campus.
Of course many of the others of
our little group will be happy about
the whole thing, so spend it enjoy
ably and profitably as it is the last
one between now and finals.
