To The Editor:
Dear Sir:
We certainly would like to know
why it is that the freshman girls
around this campus don't have the
decency to ask Stanford men to the !
dances where the girls do the asking.
It is a great stale when the Stanford
fellows have to work at such dances j
in order to get there.
It is swell that the girls take out |
the service men who are stationed j
nearby; but the girls forget that J
these servicemen will not be able
to repay them by taking them to the :
dances where the men are privileged
to choose. It is small wonder that j
the Stanford men will not ask the i
girls to the dances when the girls
will not reciprocate. Still, as we have 1
heard from some of the women's
sponsors, the girls wonder why the
Stanford men are a little leery about
asking them to dances.
This sad state of affairs was
brought very forcibly to at Ihc
Branner, Roble, Ventura formals.
Many of the men working there and
still more who sat at home, were
boys whose girls had not seized the
opportunity to repay them for their
previous dates. We boys are not the
only ones who feel this way, as many
senior girls to whom we have talked
feel ihe same way.
