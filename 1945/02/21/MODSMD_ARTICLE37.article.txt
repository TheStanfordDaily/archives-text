Stanford Folk Dancers will meet
on Wednesday night from eight to
ten o'clock in the Women's Gym,
President Dorothy Frost announced.
Club members are especially in
terested in having beginners attend
the club session. The only pre-req
uisite to membership is an interest
in folk and square dancing.
"The students showed that they
had a genuine interest in this form
of recreation by turning out for the

] Ranch Rumpus last Friday night,
and we should like to have them
become regular boosters of tolk
dancing," Miss Frost said. "Regular
attendance at the club sessions is
important for those who want to
learn such difficult dances as the
Swedish Weaving Dance; and of
course dancing is more fun when a
| congenial group dances together reg
ularly. This is a golden opportunity
for tho.'e who want to learn to dance
well, as the leader, Miss Clarice
Dechent. knows over 150 dances.
