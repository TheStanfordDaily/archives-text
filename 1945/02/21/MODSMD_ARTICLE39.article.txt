# Powerful Cougars Top Betas, May Cop Roble League Crown
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
Roble League contests presented
an extremely dull program to the
handful of onlookers that were pres
ent at last night's intra-mural activi
ties.
The once powerful Betas were
swamped by a formidable Cougar
squad to the tune of 25-7. The fra
ternity played ♦slowly all evening
and couldn't seem to keep up with
the faster Army team's fast breaks.
Handicapped considerably by the ab
sence of Morley Thompson, team
sparkplug, and George Bower, stellar
forward, the Betas never once seri
ously threatened the Cougar's
chances.
Prescott Stars
Led by "Red" Prescott, who tanked
up 14 digits, the heretofore un
herald Cougar outfit shows great
possibilities of dumping the power
ful Phi Psi quintet next week, with
the "terrific trio"—Ashley, Hood,
and Pitts—included.
The Cougars also have two rugged
guards in the personages of Catlett
and Walker, who know how to take
advantage of their weight and height
to get the ball off the backboiird.
Coupled with Woo, Nickerson, and

Sorenson; these boys may end up i
with the crown.
Chances Good
This Army team also has a great
advantage in the fact that they get
plenty of practice and exercise in
their regular physical training activi
ties of which basketball is one. They
do not tire as easily as their oppo
nents—a decided asset in any game.
Bearcats Win
In the Buchanan-Sequoia tilt, the
"Bearcats" triumphed by a score of
21-15. It was a slow game with no"
outstanding highlights. The Phi Psi
squad received an unexpected rest
by virtue of a forfeit by the Med. I
quintet.
The games originally scheduled for
Thursday night in the Lagunita
League, will be played on Wednes
day, February 28, according to Harry
Wolter, mural czar.
There are but two weeks of play
remaining in the mural schedule, i
which terminates on March 8.
