A good offense is fast becoming
the most reliable drawing card in
athletics. Rugged lines such as the
'Seven Mules" of Notre Dame fame,
and tight defenses in basketball are
slowly slipping into the background.
Perhaps this is due to a trend toward
individualism in sports as opposed
to the old days of teamwork and
cooperation.
Dream backfields no longer flour
ish as they did in the '20's and early
'30's. Individuals are beginning to
usurp all the credit, and it is usually
only one participant who is built
up in present day sport write-ups.
Take basketball for instance and
Stan McWilliams of the College of
Pacific as a specific example. In all
the papers, it was "Sensational Stan,"
who got all the credit whenever
COP won a game. It was he who
averaged almost 20 points per game
and led all the Pacific Coast scorers
with nearly 300 digits to his credit.
But they didn't mention the time
Stan missed 15 shots in a row, or
that he nearly always took most of
his team's shots. When he broke the
COP scoring record with 27 points
in one night, the papers didn't even
take heed of the fact that some in
significant forward practically gave
"Mac" his final tally rather than take
the shot himself.
Perhaps this individual glory is
what the paying public wants. Bask
etball is one of the nation's most
popular sport, for each year basket
ball attendance is higher than that
of any other sport. This, of course,
is true mainly because there are
more basketball games played. How
ever. the game as it is played in the
East is a fast, rugged, high-scoring
aflair; a game with less emphasis on
defense than is displayed on the West
Coast. In the Middle West where
basketball is played all year around,
the crowd wants to see fast action;
a fact readily attested to by the 95-25
defeat of Baylor by Rice recently,
Notre Dame breaking her high scor
ing record of 7.'5 points three times
in one week, and lowa running up

a sensational total of 10:» digits
against some hapless opponent.
Many sports commentators and
theorists are of the opinion that
basketball is becoming too easy. Six
foot nine inch giants are offering a
serious threat to the scoring ability of
shorter, better teams. In spite of the
recent rule that players can not
block a shot for the basket unless it
is traveling in a ascending arc, many
mentors throughout the nation are
for raising the hoop to heights ot
11 or 12 feet; whereas now they are
only 9 feet on the West Coast and
10 feet in the East.
Another innovation suggested is
the elimination of the backboard. Al
though many transparent back
boards are now being used, the total
absence of one would practically
revolutionize the game, for, whereas
long shot artists aim for the rim, the
tip in experts would be almost help
less without a backstop to use.
Put these two ideas together and
what do you have?—a rim with a
net on it hanging 12 feet in the air
and the score down in the 'teens.
Basketball has indeed come a long
way since the referee had to climb
a ladder to take the ball out of the
basket after each goal.

theorists are of the opinion that
basketball is becoming too easy. Six
foot nine inch giants are offering a
serious threat to the scoring ability of
shorter, better teams. In spite of the
recent rule that players can not
block a shot for the basket unless it
is traveling in a ascending arc, many
mentors throughout the nation are
for raising the hoop to heights ot
11 or 12 feet; whereas now they are
only 9 feet on the West Coast and
10 feet in the East.
Another innovation suggested is
the elimination of the backboard. Al
though many transparent back
boards are now being used, the total
absence of one would practically
revolutionize the game, for, whereas
long shot artists aim for the rim, the
tip in experts would be almost help
less without a backstop to use.
Put these two ideas together and
what do you have?—a rim with a
net on it hanging 12 feet in the air
and the score down in the 'teens.
Basketball has indeed come a long
way since the referee had to climb
a ladder to take the ball out of the
basket after each goal.
A good offense is fast becoming
the most reliable drawing card in
athletics. Rugged lines such as the
'Seven Mules" of Notre Dame fame,
and tight defenses in basketball are
slowly slipping into the background.
Perhaps this is due to a trend toward
individualism in sports as opposed
to the old days of teamwork and
cooperation.
Dream backfields no longer flour
ish as they did in the '20's and early
'30's. Individuals are beginning to
usurp all the credit, and it is usually
only one participant who is built
up in present day sport write-ups.
Take basketball for instance and
Stan McWilliams of the College of
Pacific as a specific example. In all
the papers, it was "Sensational Stan,"
who got all the credit whenever
COP won a game. It was he who
averaged almost 20 points per game
and led all the Pacific Coast scorers
with nearly 300 digits to his credit.
But they didn't mention the time
Stan missed 15 shots in a row, or
that he nearly always took most of
his team's shots. When he broke the
COP scoring record with 27 points
in one night, the papers didn't even
take heed of the fact that some in
significant forward practically gave
"Mac" his final tally rather than take
the shot himself.
Perhaps this individual glory is
what the paying public wants. Bask
etball is one of the nation's most
popular sport, for each year basket
ball attendance is higher than that
of any other sport. This, of course,
is true mainly because there are
more basketball games played. How
ever. the game as it is played in the
East is a fast, rugged, high-scoring
aflair; a game with less emphasis on
defense than is displayed on the West
Coast. In the Middle West where
basketball is played all year around,
the crowd wants to see fast action;
a fact readily attested to by the 95-25
defeat of Baylor by Rice recently,
Notre Dame breaking her high scor
ing record of 7.'5 points three times
in one week, and lowa running up

a sensational total of 10:» digits
against some hapless opponent.
