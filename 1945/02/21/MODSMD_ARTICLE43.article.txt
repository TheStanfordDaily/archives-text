# Lag. Hashers vs. Branner Tonight
## 
### 
The once-defeated Lagunita hash
; ers basketball team will take to the
maplewood of the Pavilion tonight
| at 7:30 to attempt to avenge their
1 whipping by the Branner hashers
| last week.
; The Branner quintet is favored by
; virtue of their 22-15 win over the
Lagmen last Wednesday, which saw j
Fonny Ho and A 1 Brown of the
Branner dishroom leading the squad
to victory. But the Lag hashers have
j a potentially powerful team centered
around Frank Hoffman, Dick Silber
man, and Bob Pitsker which may
J turn the tables tonight.
The Branner roster has Ross
Redeker, Stan Kilburn, and Dick
Jennings at the forward spots: Baron
Lowe at center; and Fonny Ho, Lynn I
' Miller, and A 1 Brown at guard.
