# 'Y' Sponsors Talk on Race Distinctions
## 
### 
"We feel we have a double victory
to win," said Mrs. Hester Kinnard,
recreational director working with
minority groups in Palo Alto and
elsewhere as she gave the Negro's
point of view of the race problems
j at the "Y" meeting yesterday. "We
i feel we must win the war and then
I win the problem of minority race
I segregation."
Mrs. Kinnard has supervised many
children's playgrounds, and empha
sized that she preferred working
! with mixed children. "Color doesn't
matter to children," she said, "all
that counts is whether you can throw
a ball well, or run fast, or play
fairly. It isn't until children get older
j that they think of race distinction.
Playground
i
j Realizing how many of the children
| of minority groups in Palo Alto are
i undernourished, poorly-kept, housed,
and educated, Mrs. Kinnard at
tempted to obtain a playground of
some sort. She succeeded, and now
has a lot on Ramona street where the
city will begin construction soon.
"We had a meeting of mothers and
children in the district the other
night," she laughed, "and every
single one turned up. The children
were asked what they would like
in the playgroundâ€”they requested
in particular a swing, a slide, and of
J course, a sand-box."
She has also obtained a small room
| which she plans to turn into a school
I for pre-school age children whose
j mothers must work at least part of
) the day. She has eight children al
| ready in the school, who will come
| from 8 to 2 six days a week.
I "Many of these children," she con-
I tinued, "don't even know how to
j play. Most of them have learned only
| to fight. It is not fair for we fortunate
i ones to merely look down our noses
at these newcomers. We must try
! to help them raise themselves to
| our standards of housing, education,
j play and so on.
Housing iStuation
"The housing situation is just ter
' rible," she said strongly. "In many
! houses two and three families are
living in two or three rooms."
When asked about separate hous
ing areas for the groups, she said thus
would make the problem of segrega
tion even more prevalent. "These
races do not gsk exceptional treat
j merit, they merely want an equal
, chance. In the South they are so
down-trodden that they have nor
time to think about what they don't
| have, but when they arrive in the
North they realize the chances they
| have missed, and they attempt to
do something about it.
"If they were given equal oppor
tunities, if the housing situation were
I improved, social mixing in the sense
I that many people mean would not
be at all necessary. These people
j enjoy company and relationships
| among themselves as much as do the
Caucasians."
