# Betas Tangle With Phi Delts
## 
### 
Given the role of "under-puppy" i
to (he tune of 5-1 by local book- i
j makers up the Row, the Phi Delts
| anxiously await their man-sized job i
of tackling the Beta basketball team
tonight at 7:30 in Encina Gym.
Given the impetus of an extra
player, the Phi Delts expect their
j grudge battle to materialize against
| the red-shirted Betas. Beta sup
porters contend that their smoothly I
i oiled machine will not get rusty in
J the second half tonight, as it so j
j nobly did against the Phi Psis last '
! week.
The favorites intend to field a
I starting combination with Morley
j Thompson and George Bower at i
j forwards, Ric Supple at center, ;ind j
| Joe Sher and John Hanlon at guards. |
Thompson, usually the leading scorer
no matter whom he plays for, is ex- i
i pected to spell D-E-F-E-A-T for
j the Phi Delts.
The Betas intend to use their two
j capable substitutes if the going gets
j toughâ€”namely, Doug Tuck and Tom
1 Fagan.
Against this array of stars, the
underdogs will field Ed Hall and
Ken Husby at forwards, Dave Grey
at center, and Joe Pickering and Ray
Ryan at guards. Husby, of the Legal
Eagle outfit, should keep the Phi
Delt hopes high, if not the score, j
Bob Gettys, a recent pledge, is also
slated to see action. Johnny Burris |
is an alternate forward.

| A spirited rooting contest is ex
i pected between the women sup
porters of both teams. Officials urge
i all students to spend their vacation
nifiht at the game and not to waste
I gasoline leedlessly.
