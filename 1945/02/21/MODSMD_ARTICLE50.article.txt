# Farm Drama Libe Second to None--Heffner
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
"When I came to Stanford in 1939, j
Dr. Wilbur told me, 'We want to :
build at Stanford an outstanding j
program in drama and theater that j
will rank with the best of universi
ties in the United States,'" said Dr. I
Hubert C. Heffner, dean of the De
partment of Speech and Drama, re
cently. "Today, this program is sec
ond to none in the United States, and
ranks with the top three similar de
partments in the universities of l
Washington and Wisconsin and Yale
University."
Student Achievement
This achievement has been accom
plished by the students, and because
of their interest in the program, he
added. Vital to the fulfillment of
this ideal has been the establishment
of a comprehensive drama library,
Dr. Heffner said. "And without such
a library, students carfnot expect to
acquire an adequate background for
the study of drama and the theater.
"When I came I discovered that j
we had no libiary for the kind of
department the University wanted
to build. We did have certain good
collections—one on English drama
of the Renaissance period—but very
little in American drama and practi
cally nothing on theater.
"My first graduate students were
terribly handicapped—you can't en
courage graduates with no equip
ment—so they began talking, inter
ested other students in the project,
and set aside from the student dra
matic fund two different grants of
$4500 for the building of a drama
library."
Grants Spurred Interest
This action immediately spurred
interest, he continued. By going
through secondhand catalogues they j
"bought thousands of books—we got j
more for our money than you can

imagine," said Dr. Heffner with a
smile.
This, in turn, aroused the interest
of alumni, and they began contrib
uting to the project. "Every year,
Charles K. Field, '95 (the drama de
partment claims him as its oldest
alumnus, because his special inter
est was dramatics, although we had
no department for it at that time),
gives us a gift. Miss Millicent Sears
donated a very fine collection of old
scrapbooks with articles on drama,
reviews, theater programs, and
countless other souvenirs that are
invaluable for diama research —and
today it is almost impossible to get
old play reviews."
"With this accomplished," he con
tinued, "we turned to the movies.
They gave us scripts, and now we
have a fine collection of motion pic
ture scripts given to us because of
the interests the students aroused."
Gifts of Barrett 11. Clark
One thing led to another in the
growth of the drama library. "Dr.
van Patten, director of the Univer
sity Libraries, secured funds for the
purchase of the Barrett H. Clark
library of American drama. Barrett
Clark was for many years the chief
editor of Samuel French, Inc., the
oldest play-publishing firm extant;
and he later became the head of
Dramatists Play Service, the organi
zation of all outstanding playwrights.
He has become an outstanding critic
and authority on drama and has
many books to his credit. His own
great collection is now in the Stan
ford drama library," added Dr. Heff
ner with pride.
3,000-5,000 Books
The drama library now contains
from 3,000 to 5,000 books, in addi
tion to countless music scores, pro
grams, pamphlets, and rare scrap
books. It specializes in American

drama and the American theater,
which was, for over a century, sim
ply English drama in a colonial set
ting. In conjunction with this branch
of the library are some early Amer
ican original manuscripts. "We have
to take very good care of them,"
said Dr. Heffner, "for if we allowed
them to be handled they would fall
to pieces."
The library, however, is not yet
complete, emphasized Dr. Heffner.
"With the war so many British book
sellers unloaded books in America
that we had to buy rapidly so as not
to miss some good bargains; and as
a result our funds are now practi
cally gone."
"Unfortunately, now is the time
to buy books," he said. "There are
many good book bargains available,
but we don't have the money to buy
them. We are trying to get a good
collection on music drama too—mu
sical comedies, operettas, and so

forth—but they are hard to find."
Drama Libe Open
The drama library is now housed
in the main library near the Bender
Room and next to the Felton Col
lection. "It is open to all students,"
said Dr. HeUner, "but they complain
about it because they would like to
have it more conveniently situated
by a reading room."
"Our ultimate goal is a library
that would attract outstanding stu
dents to do graduate work at Stan
ford in theater and drama. This goal
can be realized by only two things:
an outstanding faculty, and a library
to give to them. We want a library
so good that it would attract schol
ars for research much as the Hoover
War Library does."
"The older institutions have the
head start on us," he concludcd, "but
if we had such a library we could
catch up with them—and it would
be to the students' profit."

so good that it would attract schol
ars for research much as the Hoover
War Library does."
"The older institutions have the
head start on us," he concludcd, "but
if we had such a library we could
catch up with them—and it would
be to the students' profit."
"When I came to Stanford in 1939, j
Dr. Wilbur told me, 'We want to :
build at Stanford an outstanding j
program in drama and theater that j
will rank with the best of universi
ties in the United States,'" said Dr. I
Hubert C. Heffner, dean of the De
partment of Speech and Drama, re
cently. "Today, this program is sec
ond to none in the United States, and
ranks with the top three similar de
partments in the universities of l
Washington and Wisconsin and Yale
University."
Student Achievement
This achievement has been accom
plished by the students, and because
of their interest in the program, he
added. Vital to the fulfillment of
this ideal has been the establishment
of a comprehensive drama library,
Dr. Heffner said. "And without such
a library, students carfnot expect to
acquire an adequate background for
the study of drama and the theater.
"When I came I discovered that j
we had no libiary for the kind of
department the University wanted
to build. We did have certain good
collections—one on English drama
of the Renaissance period—but very
little in American drama and practi
cally nothing on theater.
"My first graduate students were
terribly handicapped—you can't en
courage graduates with no equip
ment—so they began talking, inter
ested other students in the project,
and set aside from the student dra
matic fund two different grants of
$4500 for the building of a drama
library."
Grants Spurred Interest
This action immediately spurred
interest, he continued. By going
through secondhand catalogues they j
"bought thousands of books—we got j
more for our money than you can

imagine," said Dr. Heffner with a
smile.
This, in turn, aroused the interest
of alumni, and they began contrib
uting to the project. "Every year,
Charles K. Field, '95 (the drama de
partment claims him as its oldest
alumnus, because his special inter
est was dramatics, although we had
no department for it at that time),
gives us a gift. Miss Millicent Sears
donated a very fine collection of old
scrapbooks with articles on drama,
reviews, theater programs, and
countless other souvenirs that are
invaluable for diama research —and
today it is almost impossible to get
old play reviews."
"With this accomplished," he con
tinued, "we turned to the movies.
They gave us scripts, and now we
have a fine collection of motion pic
ture scripts given to us because of
the interests the students aroused."
Gifts of Barrett 11. Clark
One thing led to another in the
growth of the drama library. "Dr.
van Patten, director of the Univer
sity Libraries, secured funds for the
purchase of the Barrett H. Clark
library of American drama. Barrett
Clark was for many years the chief
editor of Samuel French, Inc., the
oldest play-publishing firm extant;
and he later became the head of
Dramatists Play Service, the organi
zation of all outstanding playwrights.
He has become an outstanding critic
and authority on drama and has
many books to his credit. His own
great collection is now in the Stan
ford drama library," added Dr. Heff
ner with pride.
3,000-5,000 Books
The drama library now contains
from 3,000 to 5,000 books, in addi
tion to countless music scores, pro
grams, pamphlets, and rare scrap
books. It specializes in American

drama and the American theater,
which was, for over a century, sim
ply English drama in a colonial set
ting. In conjunction with this branch
of the library are some early Amer
ican original manuscripts. "We have
to take very good care of them,"
said Dr. Heffner, "for if we allowed
them to be handled they would fall
to pieces."
The library, however, is not yet
complete, emphasized Dr. Heffner.
"With the war so many British book
sellers unloaded books in America
that we had to buy rapidly so as not
to miss some good bargains; and as
a result our funds are now practi
cally gone."
"Unfortunately, now is the time
to buy books," he said. "There are
many good book bargains available,
but we don't have the money to buy
them. We are trying to get a good
collection on music drama too—mu
sical comedies, operettas, and so

forth—but they are hard to find."
Drama Libe Open
The drama library is now housed
in the main library near the Bender
Room and next to the Felton Col
lection. "It is open to all students,"
said Dr. HeUner, "but they complain
about it because they would like to
have it more conveniently situated
by a reading room."
"Our ultimate goal is a library
that would attract outstanding stu
dents to do graduate work at Stan
ford in theater and drama. This goal
can be realized by only two things:
an outstanding faculty, and a library
to give to them. We want a library
so good that it would attract schol

by a reading room."
"Our ultimate goal is a library
that would attract outstanding stu
dents to do graduate work at Stan
ford in theater and drama. This goal
can be realized by only two things:
an outstanding faculty, and a library
to give to them. We want a library
so good that it would attract schol
ars for research much as the Hoover
War Library does."
"The older institutions have the
head start on us," he concludcd, "but
if we had such a library we could
catch up with them—and it would
be to the students' profit."
"When I came to Stanford in 1939, j
Dr. Wilbur told me, 'We want to :
build at Stanford an outstanding j
program in drama and theater that j
will rank with the best of universi
ties in the United States,'" said Dr. I
Hubert C. Heffner, dean of the De
partment of Speech and Drama, re
cently. "Today, this program is sec
ond to none in the United States, and
ranks with the top three similar de
partments in the universities of l
Washington and Wisconsin and Yale
University."
Student Achievement
This achievement has been accom
plished by the students, and because
of their interest in the program, he
added. Vital to the fulfillment of
this ideal has been the establishment
of a comprehensive drama library,
Dr. Heffner said. "And without such
a library, students carfnot expect to
acquire an adequate background for
the study of drama and the theater.
"When I came I discovered that j
we had no libiary for the kind of
department the University wanted
to build. We did have certain good
collections—one on English drama
of the Renaissance period—but very
little in American drama and practi
cally nothing on theater.
"My first graduate students were
terribly handicapped—you can't en
courage graduates with no equip
ment—so they began talking, inter
ested other students in the project,
and set aside from the student dra
matic fund two different grants of
$4500 for the building of a drama
library."
Grants Spurred Interest
This action immediately spurred
interest, he continued. By going
through secondhand catalogues they j
"bought thousands of books—we got j
more for our money than you can

imagine," said Dr. Heffner with a
smile.
This, in turn, aroused the interest
of alumni, and they began contrib
uting to the project. "Every year,
Charles K. Field, '95 (the drama de
partment claims him as its oldest
alumnus, because his special inter
est was dramatics, although we had
no department for it at that time),
gives us a gift. Miss Millicent Sears
donated a very fine collection of old
scrapbooks with articles on drama,
reviews, theater programs, and
countless other souvenirs that are
invaluable for diama research —and
today it is almost impossible to get
old play reviews."
"With this accomplished," he con
tinued, "we turned to the movies.
They gave us scripts, and now we
have a fine collection of motion pic
ture scripts given to us because of
the interests the students aroused."
Gifts of Barrett 11. Clark
One thing led to another in the
growth of the drama library. "Dr.
van Patten, director of the Univer
sity Libraries, secured funds for the
purchase of the Barrett H. Clark
library of American drama. Barrett
Clark was for many years the chief
editor of Samuel French, Inc., the
oldest play-publishing firm extant;
and he later became the head of
Dramatists Play Service, the organi
zation of all outstanding playwrights.
He has become an outstanding critic
and authority on drama and has
many books to his credit. His own
great collection is now in the Stan
ford drama library," added Dr. Heff
ner with pride.
3,000-5,000 Books
The drama library now contains
from 3,000 to 5,000 books, in addi
tion to countless music scores, pro
grams, pamphlets, and rare scrap
books. It specializes in American

drama and the American theater,
which was, for over a century, sim
ply English drama in a colonial set
ting. In conjunction with this branch
of the library are some early Amer
ican original manuscripts. "We have
to take very good care of them,"
said Dr. Heffner, "for if we allowed
them to be handled they would fall
to pieces."
The library, however, is not yet
complete, emphasized Dr. Heffner.
"With the war so many British book
sellers unloaded books in America
that we had to buy rapidly so as not
to miss some good bargains; and as
a result our funds are now practi
cally gone."
"Unfortunately, now is the time
to buy books," he said. "There are
many good book bargains available,
but we don't have the money to buy
them. We are trying to get a good
collection on music drama too—mu
sical comedies, operettas, and so

forth—but they are hard to find."
Drama Libe Open
The drama library is now housed
in the main library near the Bender
Room and next to the Felton Col
lection. "It is open to all students,"
said Dr. HeUner, "but they complain
about it because they would like to
have it more conveniently situated
by a reading room."
