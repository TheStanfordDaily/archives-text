j An increasing interest in Conti
j nental literatures underlay the liter
i ary "flowering of New England" in
| the middle of the 19th century. To
j this new interest contributions were
made by the so-called Transcenden
talists, as well as by Harvard pro
fessors, such as Ticknor, Everett,
and Longfellow. The major Trans
cendentalist achievement was the
14-volume "Specimens of Foreign
Standard Literature 1838-1842,"
edited by George Ripley, founder of
the Brook Farm community. This
series included the first English
translation of Eckermann's "Con
versations with Goethe, the most
extensive collection of lyrics of
Goethe and Schiller that had yet
appeared in translation, and impor
tant works of French and German
philosophy and literary history. The
content of the series, and its signifi
cance for American intellectual his
tory, will be examined by Mr. Bestor
and he will give quotations from
unpublished correspondence between
the editors.
Faculty, students, and others in
terested are welcome. Refreshments
are served at 4:15; Mr. Bestor will
begin his paper at 4:30.
