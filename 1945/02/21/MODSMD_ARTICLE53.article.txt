# Education Grad Relates Stories of West Africa
## 
### KOD BROWNING 
Sierra Leone is an interesting country to visit but a hard country to
live in, according to Hans Rassmussen. Having lived in this unusual place
for nine years, Mr. Rassmussen has many fascinating stories to tell. He was
born in Denmark and received his secondary education there. He has,
however, an M.A. degree from the University of Michigan, and is now

working for his doctor's degree, in*
! education here at Stanford.
Sierra Leone is a British Crown
Colony located on the West African
coast in the region called the Slave
Coast. This part of Africa is callcd
"The While Man's Grave" because of
the unhealthy jungle conditions
there for the white men. The cli
mate is tropical with about 166
inches of rainfall annually. It is
from this region that the cola nuts
are obtained for the making of such
drinks as Coca-Cola. Although the
nut has a very bitter taste, the na
tives chew it while working because
of the stimulant it contains.
The Waterloo Training School
where Mr. Rasmussen taught gave
j selected native students a high-
I school education. There were eight
teachers and about 200 students,
mainly boys, at the school, and the
handicaps of teaching in such a
place were enormous.
i Devil's Society
The natives of the region have
what is called a "Devil's Society" in
each tribe. This group, composed of
some of the older members of the
tribe, introduces the older boys of
the tribe into the tribal secrets,
methods of warfare, and the use of
knives. In this ceremony, which
lasts for about two months a year
for three years, the boys are whipped
and forced to go through many cruel
hardships. At the conclusion of this
tribal education those who have sur
vived it are considered to be full—
I fledged men.
Leopard Terror
"Leopards are quite numerous in
this region," Mr. Rassmussen said.
Upon one occasion he and a native
boy were walking several miles at
night to where Mr. Rassmussen's car
was parked. The native boy was
carrying a lantern with him but nei
ther of them had a gun. Suddenly
they became aware ot the distinctive
odor of a leopard which was follow
ing them. Mr. Rassmussen quickly
turned the lantern up high, and
after many terrifying moments they
reached the car before the leopard
could charge them. "After that ex
perience," said Mr. Rassmussen, "I
always carried a revolver with me."
Malaria is quite rampant in this
area; Mr. Rassmussen says that he
has had it no less than 30 times. The
devastating effect it has on the body
has been greatly reduced, however,
by the recent German invention of
the drug atabrine. The diseases and
climate are so hard on white men
in Sierra Leone that they can only
remain there for about a year and a
half at a time.
As soon as he is finished with his
work here at Stanford Mr. Rass
mussen expects to go to South Africa
with his ■wife, a Californian. He has
been offered a teaching position
there in the Helderberg College near
Cape Town.
