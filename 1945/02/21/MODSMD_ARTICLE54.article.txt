# Firemen Put Out Jackson Hall Blaze
## 
### 
At 12:19 yesterday three fire trucks
and 10 men including hashers on
duty, were called to a fire in Jackson
Hall on Salvatierra street.
The fire was extinguished in half
an hour or so, and little damage was
done. The fire, caused by a defective
oil burner, was confined to the base
ment floor. The blaze was put out
successfully with foam, which is
especially effective on oil , fires.
