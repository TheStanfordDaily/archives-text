### YEN RAB LE GUG 
"Ah wants yo all to know that the Chaparral, the best li'l ole publica
tion west of Rosotti's, will appeah at news stands all ovah campus at 9
Friday morning." So stated Old Boy Dick Driscoll in an exclusive inter
view in the Press Building's gentlemen's lounge yesterday.
When asked whether the Winter Chappie will be a tremendous, super-

colossal number or not, the Ancient
One quipped, "j Si!" displaying his
brilliant knowledge of Spanish.
Further evidence of remarkable
linguistic ability was shown when
he answered "Ja!" to the question,
"Will the Winter Chaparral be sold
at the new low price of 25 cents."
Before your reporter could get an
other statement from Driscoll, Biz
Manager Bill Gilbert (the Grand In
quisitor of Men's Council) came out
of his office screaming, "Wit all da
pipples hoff cempus Friday, we are
losink money yat, so as a special
favor habsolutely free, we are hold
ink over 300 copies to be sold hat da
Cellar store on Monday. Halso, ve
will for those so requestink reserve
copies, providink requests arc in by
Wednesday night."
With this, Barney Gugel crawled
in under the door disguised as an
itinerant Italian fish peddler and
told of the marvelous features of the
issue.
"Hima tal you, disa story by Rene
Zentner, shesa da stuff. Shcsa da
fun'. Besides dat, shesa da good."
At that moment, the entire Chap
pie crew marched off, chanting a
dirge in their favorite tongue, Es
peranto:
"Iba grotsup heb rebuck,
Buy dat Chappy, Yuk, Yuk, Yuk."
