# Holiday Kills Study Plans
## 
### CATHERINE OWEN 
In the bottom of one of the waste
baskets in the Ad Building lives a
fiend who does nothing but devise
plans for plaguing Stanford students.
He presents them to more civilized
inhabitants of the Ad Building as
upstanding propositions, but he al
ways has a deeper reason behind his
schemes —he delights in seeing peo
ple work.
) Several weeks ago Fiend crawled
from his waste basket and suggested
that Stanford declare a one-day holi
day, using the argument that after
a day's rest, bedraggled students
would have regained their energy.
Undercover Work Begins
After this plan was accepted, Fiend
began his undercover work. He
talked some instructors into giving
tests the day after vacation, some
into doubling assignments, others
into having term papers due on lhat
day—and then blamed it all on to
George Washington.
Fiend had also arranged for giving
all campus women non-quota l:3o's.
His fangs clattered in an evil chuckle
as he thought of the girls, locked in
their rooms with Burns and Buchs
baum, and cursing the l:3o's that they
were wasting.
Takes lloble Position
In order to further amuse himself,
Fiend stationed himself in front of
Ruble in order to gaze at all of the
lighted windows. He went away de
jected, though. Few were the rooms
with lights on—and they were mere
ly the ones whose inmates were
avidly perfecting their Bacall techni
ques before their mirrors.
Furthermore, the Roble steps and
walk were crowded with groups of
girls knitting and practicing on their
yo-yo's. At 1:29 they filed into Roble,
determinedly vowing that they'd
be guilty of wasting a late
Pleave.
Boathousc Further Frustrates
That night as Fiend lay thrashing
in his waste basket, he calmed his
disappointment by thinking of the
work that would be done the next
day and of the play that wouldn't be
done. But that was before he learned
about boathouse majors.
I'll say no more than that Fiend
was in great pain the next day. He
shed a tear as he sat upon numerous
copies of neglected Burns, and he
slashed his wrists for not having
chopped holes in the bottoms of all
the canoes the night before.
Today there isn't a cherry tree left
on campus—Fiend chopped them all
down yesterday to get even with
George Washington.

upstanding propositions, but he al
ways has a deeper reason behind his
schemes —he delights in seeing peo
ple work.
) Several weeks ago Fiend crawled
from his waste basket and suggested
that Stanford declare a one-day holi
day, using the argument that after
a day's rest, bedraggled students
would have regained their energy.
Undercover Work Begins
After this plan was accepted, Fiend
began his undercover work. He
talked some instructors into giving
tests the day after vacation, some
into doubling assignments, others
into having term papers due on lhat
day—and then blamed it all on to
George Washington.
Fiend had also arranged for giving
all campus women non-quota l:3o's.
His fangs clattered in an evil chuckle
as he thought of the girls, locked in
their rooms with Burns and Buchs
baum, and cursing the l:3o's that they
were wasting.
Takes lloble Position
In order to further amuse himself,
Fiend stationed himself in front of
Ruble in order to gaze at all of the
lighted windows. He went away de
jected, though. Few were the rooms
with lights on—and they were mere
ly the ones whose inmates were
avidly perfecting their Bacall techni
ques before their mirrors.
Furthermore, the Roble steps and
walk were crowded with groups of
girls knitting and practicing on their
yo-yo's. At 1:29 they filed into Roble,
determinedly vowing that they'd
be guilty of wasting a late
Pleave.
Boathousc Further Frustrates
That night as Fiend lay thrashing
in his waste basket, he calmed his
disappointment by thinking of the
work that would be done the next
day and of the play that wouldn't be
done. But that was before he learned
about boathouse majors.
I'll say no more than that Fiend
was in great pain the next day. He
shed a tear as he sat upon numerous
copies of neglected Burns, and he
slashed his wrists for not having
chopped holes in the bottoms of all
the canoes the night before.
Today there isn't a cherry tree left
on campus—Fiend chopped them all
down yesterday to get even with
George Washington.
In the bottom of one of the waste
baskets in the Ad Building lives a
fiend who does nothing but devise
plans for plaguing Stanford students.
He presents them to more civilized
inhabitants of the Ad Building as
upstanding propositions, but he al
ways has a deeper reason behind his
schemes —he delights in seeing peo
ple work.
