## 
### 
Presenting before Excom the re
sults of voting in Women's Living
groups, J. I). Williams Wednesday

night announced
that 502 women,
over-riding the
IX4 affirmatives,
were against the
abolition of
Xomin a t in g
Committee, with

the provision, he believed, that the
committee function only before the
period for petitions, and place on
the ballot two qualified candidates
lor each office.
The results of voting in men's
groups had not been received, but
since the consensus seemed to be
against Nominating Committee, Ed
Luce suggested that the committee
be retained for office for which wom
en alone are eligible and that candi
dates for all other offices be chosen
by net it ion.
Members of Excom, who generally
believe a Nominating Committee to
be unnecessary and undemocratic,
said that if it were abolished, the
responsibility for having good candi
dates on the bidlot would rest with
the studeuts and in the event that

no candidates were running, respon
sibility might he given to house
presidents to urge qualified candi
dates to petition. "There is no such
apathy among students concerning
elections as to suppose that holes
will be left in the ballot," said
Jeannette Grimsley, War Board
chairman.
An argument for the committee
was given by Bill Gilbert on behalf
of a student: "Those officers now
in student government have proven
that they are qualified for office.
They should have the right to choose
their successors through Nominating
Committee."
Barbara White, ASSU president,
asked that Betsy Babbitt, Ed Luce,
and J. I). Williams prepare a plan
for the Nominating Committee, tak
ing into account the wishes of the
students as expressed through the
referendum, to he presented at
Wednesday's Excom meeting, at 7
p.m. in the Excom Boom. Anxious
that students interested in the matter
attend, Excom asked all such stu
dents to be present and to participate
in the discussion.
Discussion of the plan for better
student representation on Exl'uiii was

tabled, m the hope that students
with ideas or opinions on the pro
posal will be present at Wednesday's
meeting when it will be discussed at
length.
Because of the lack of students
taking advantage of the Cellar's eve
ning hours on Friday, Excom voted
to close the Cellar at this time, and
in the evening hours of University
holidays.
Upon receiving the letter of resig
nation of Jordan Peck ha in, Men's
Vocom president. Excom voted and
passed on the abolition of this or
ganization because of the lack of
interest shown at its initial meet
ings. The committee believes that
men attending Stanford at present
haven't the need of making a voca
tional choice that women have.
At the suggestion of ASSU Vice
president Marylou McClure, it was
decided that firesides may be held
by campus living groups with her
permission without applying a week
in advance.
Jim Emerson's proposal that $50
be appropriated to Cardinals for
Pow-Wow expenses, and $25 addi
tional for the Fmsh Bible (Stanford
Hail d book) was passed.
