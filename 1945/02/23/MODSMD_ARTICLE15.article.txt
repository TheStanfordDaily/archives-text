"GERMANY, THAT TRAGIC NATION"
One of the reasons why Stanford students
stay away from the Tuesday Series in droves
may be because their sensitive intellects are
jarred by just the kind of unpleasant fact with
which Mr. van Walt's lecture shook us last
Tuesday.
The Daily headline, "No Good Germans
Left," did not exaggerate the gist of Mr. van
Walt's contribution to our thinking about a
postwar world.
Any of the plans which have been sug
gested for the treatment of a conguered Ger
many spring essentially from the author's con
ception of the attitude of the German people.
To building such plans on an erroneous con
ception of the German people would probably
be one of the most tragic mistakes that this
generation could make.
We think it can be taken as the conviction
of many thoughtful people that the peace forced
upon Germany after the war laid the basis for
this war. The implications of Mr. van Walt's
statements lead to the same mockery of the only
sane solution to the German problem, which
is to restore, with honesty, the German people
to a useful citizenship in the world.
Without doubt, we know less about Ger
mans than Mr. van Walt, and without doubt,
Mr. van Walt had to make the statement that
Germany has been turned into "a nation of
paranoics—from a nation of men, women and
children into a nation of dangerous neurotics,"
without knowing more than a minute percentage
of Germans.
We have in mind a recent survey from which
an American columnist guotes, made by trained
psychologists who traveled into recently-won
German country and interviewed the ordinary
people on the roads. Time and again they met
people who were exceedingly vague about the
tenets of the so-called Nazi philosophy, and
showed an amazing lucidity about the sound
common sense that ought to be expected of
German people.
There are some ideas that ring true about
people in general and some that ring false, and
any nation of "paranoics" rings false to us. It
ought to be undoubtedly true that the Germans
should come closest. They received Hitler in
a social and economic outlook of desperation,
and certainly what he promulgated did not
ease it. Any confidence they showed was half
hysterical and always pitiable.
We sometimes think that the military, the
diplomats, the tourists and correspondents, and
all who have limited contact with the people,
are the ones who most easily lose sight of the
:remendous capacity that human beings have
tor clinging to their essential ideas of right and
vrong, security and insecurity. k
From this same core of essential sanity can
;ome a terrific capacity to withstand "rubber
stamp" philosophies. We do not doubt that
he Germans supported Hitler politically, as the

only strength in Germany, but*we doubt if his
philosophical "Christ Complex" is any more
condoned than the way we Americans attend
the movies as representative entertainment but
barely condone the "Hollywood" social stan
dards, as a nation.
It seems that the only wise policy is to be
determined to search the entire German nation
for the responsible people who are there, so that
they can restore confidence in their people's
own future as world citizens. We will only do
this if we are also determined that there shall
be guarantees that any industrious nation shall
be able to secure fairly the means to live in
peace and security in a decent world.

he Germans supported Hitler politically, as the

only strength in Germany, but*we doubt if his
philosophical "Christ Complex" is any more
condoned than the way we Americans attend
the movies as representative entertainment but
barely condone the "Hollywood" social stan
dards, as a nation.
It seems that the only wise policy is to be
determined to search the entire German nation
for the responsible people who are there, so that
they can restore confidence in their people's
own future as world citizens. We will only do

be able to secure fairly the means to live in
peace and security in a decent world.
"GERMANY, THAT TRAGIC NATION"
One of the reasons why Stanford students
stay away from the Tuesday Series in droves
may be because their sensitive intellects are
jarred by just the kind of unpleasant fact with
which Mr. van Walt's lecture shook us last
Tuesday.
The Daily headline, "No Good Germans
Left," did not exaggerate the gist of Mr. van
Walt's contribution to our thinking about a
postwar world.
Any of the plans which have been sug
gested for the treatment of a conguered Ger
many spring essentially from the author's con
ception of the attitude of the German people.
To building such plans on an erroneous con
ception of the German people would probably
be one of the most tragic mistakes that this
generation could make.
We think it can be taken as the conviction
of many thoughtful people that the peace forced
upon Germany after the war laid the basis for
this war. The implications of Mr. van Walt's
statements lead to the same mockery of the only
sane solution to the German problem, which
is to restore, with honesty, the German people
to a useful citizenship in the world.
Without doubt, we know less about Ger
mans than Mr. van Walt, and without doubt,
Mr. van Walt had to make the statement that
Germany has been turned into "a nation of
paranoics—from a nation of men, women and
children into a nation of dangerous neurotics,"
without knowing more than a minute percentage
of Germans.
We have in mind a recent survey from which
an American columnist guotes, made by trained
psychologists who traveled into recently-won
German country and interviewed the ordinary
people on the roads. Time and again they met
people who were exceedingly vague about the
tenets of the so-called Nazi philosophy, and
showed an amazing lucidity about the sound
common sense that ought to be expected of
German people.
There are some ideas that ring true about
people in general and some that ring false, and
any nation of "paranoics" rings false to us. It
ought to be undoubtedly true that the Germans
should come closest. They received Hitler in
a social and economic outlook of desperation,
and certainly what he promulgated did not
ease it. Any confidence they showed was half
hysterical and always pitiable.
We sometimes think that the military, the
diplomats, the tourists and correspondents, and
all who have limited contact with the people,
are the ones who most easily lose sight of the
:remendous capacity that human beings have
tor clinging to their essential ideas of right and
vrong, security and insecurity. k
