The battle of Iwo Jirna is a very hotly'contested af
fair. This is true because our invasion certainly
shouldn't have been a surprise, considering the place's
proximity to Sgipan, and because there were very few
strips of beach on which we could land, so our pro
jected beachhead was easy to guess.
The island itself is shaped like an inverted drop, very
broad and rounded at the top. and tapering down to
the base. It is divided by a line of hills running the
better part of its lenglh. and the terrain, being very
broken and highly defensible, was strengthened by
artifical barriers and fortifications that have been under
construction for the last 25 years.
Our landings were made at the southern end of the
island, and were bitterly contested. The Japanese prob
ably made their main effort in the hills dividing the
island, posting their troops in the many caves and send
ing machine gun and mortar fire down on the Marines
as the latter climbed up to get them. But the American
assault prevailed, and our forces cut across the island,
isolating the southern tip.
The enemy garrison is thus now split, and we are
also lodged on the eastern side of the island, which is
broader than the western, since the hill line does not
split the terrain symmetrically. The southern airfield
is in our hands, and the next step is to get the larger
one in the north.
It is obvious that our progress north will be easier
if it moves up the eastern side of the island, since there
is a good rqad here, and also there is more elbow room,
but the -Japanese are holding tenaciously to a hill on
the right flank of the western side of our beachhead.
This salient might have to be wiped out first, since it
does present a danger to the Marine flank and rear.
