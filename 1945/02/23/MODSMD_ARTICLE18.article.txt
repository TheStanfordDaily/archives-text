Ugh!
Me read in Stanford Daily of February 5 that Great
American Fathers show films of Canada, "the land ot
the totem poles and prairie poles." Pardon me while
I push a totem pole aside and chew some moccasin
leather for my snowshoes.
Me very glad that Yankees so fortunate as to hear
such representative Canadian music as reindeer drums
cf northern Eskimos. My squaw thanks you, my papoose
thanks you and I thank you.
Yours truly,
Ron Hasgart.
