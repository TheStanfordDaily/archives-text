### BILL ADAMS 
After months of fruitless bickering
and uncertainty, it finally appears
that the American public will again
be treated to its annual dose of
baseball this spring and summer, in
one form or another. This is prob
ably just as well for the war effort,
for Americans are surprisingly stub
born and insistent about some things
which they consider their irrevocable
rights. They will give up their vaca
tions, work in war plants, get along
without many peacetime commodi
ties, some of them will even move
to the back of a crowded bus or
streetcar; but if you try to take base
ball, which they consider an integral
part of America, away from them,
you are liable to reach the limit of
their endurance.
No All-Star Game
As for the character of the play
which war-time fans are going to
get, the best we can say is that it is
infinitely better than nothing. We
hate to see the All-Star game goâ€”
it has become a traditional feature.
We cannot help feeling sorry for
Manager Luke Sewell of the St.
Louis Browns, who will now be un
able to coach the American League
aggregation after winning his first
pennant. From present indications it
is doubtful if Mr. Sewell will see
another flag for quite awhile.
We would be much more sorry to
see the World Series go. The two
league pennant chases would lose
a considerable measure of public in
terest without the anticipation of a
playoff for the undisputed champion
ship.
Still Baseball
Spectators have one great conso
lation: the plan to split leagues up
into eastern and western divisions,
forming two new leagues, was
funked. Tradition meaiw a great deal
in baseball, at least to the fan. This
would be too much.
But whatever its character, we
will have baseball all over the
country; including the Pacific Coast.
The P.C.L. was happily riot involved
in the proceedings, which were
mainly concerned with the traveling
space occupied by teams, since it
wisely adopted-4he seven-game series
plan long ago. As long as we have
baseball our forces overseas will
know that their America is still free.
