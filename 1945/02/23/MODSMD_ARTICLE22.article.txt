# Phi Delts Dump Betas
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Reigning supreme in both score j
and kegs of beer, the Phi Dell bask
etball team took a well-earned day
off yesterday after their astounding j
30-24 victory over the Betas in j
Encina Gym Wednesday eve. With j
lead changing at least five times ]
throughout the affair, the Phi Delts j
erased a seven-point lead midway i
in the second half.
High point man for the evening !
was Morley Thompson of the Beta ;
outfit with 15 points behind his ,
name. Eld Hall, Phi Delt forward, led
the victors with 14 digits.
It was truly a battle between Hall '
and Thompson throughout the early j
part of the game as the Phi Delts J
built up a 8-7 lead. Successive ;
buckets by Barry Weber and Doug
Tuck seemed to change the tide of
the game as the Betas pulled up to
a 13-9 lead at the half.
After the rest period, the losers
found their eye, and stacked up a
21-14 advantage after John Hanlon
and Thompson swished the net from
all sides. But the Phi Delts decided
that the Betas should go no further,
and sent Ken Husby, Dave Gray, j
and Hall on pretty fast breaks to
take a 22-21 lead.
The Beta team all but threw up
its hands in disgust, as Hall and
Husby plus a last-minute basket by

I Johnny Burris took the count up to
j 30-24 when the belated second hand
| made its last revolution.
Sideline spectators, a very few to
! be exact, were amazed to find that
j members of both teams could last
j the game out. "Stern" reffing kept
i the two teams on an equal basis
j throughout the encounter.
