Minus a field pack and rifle, the
M.E. s's felt a bit out of uniform
for their Army field trip last Friday.
However, a one man reconnaissance
patrol, Professor Shepard of the
metallurgy department, assured them
that such equipment was unneces
sary for an inspection of Joshua
Hendy's plant at Sunnyvale. The
ex-infantrymen, now turned engi
neers, found the spacious, easy-rid
ing convertibles —G.I. six wheelers—
just to their liking.
As they cruised along, talk turned
to things dear to the heart of every
engineer. A heated debate was going
on in one corner of the truck about
the engine's gear reduction system,
[n another corner there was a dis
cussion of the heat treatment of the
convertible's chassis. Then a beauti
ful brunette whizzed by and waved
—that ended the shop talk.
First on the agenda at the plant
was the showing of two films on
turbines. The fellows were impressed
by the "tornado in a box" and when
"entropy" emerged as the dominating
figure, there was a wild cheer. The
sales talk for gas turbines was very
convincing, but one I. C. Engines
student expressed the feelings of
the rest of the class when he said,
That sounds pretty good, but I'd
like to hear Professor Wiedmann's
verdict before I ever buy a gas
turbine."
There were quite a few women in
the turbine shop and their morale
sky-rocketed when they saw the
soldiers who came to watch them at
work. Of course, no trip is complete
without a demonstration of the
SCHEINEMAN STRUT.
The main attraction at Hendy's,
however, was the cutting of large
gears. It was amazing to see huge
bobbing machines controlled by
females in slacks and T shirts. The
women cut quite a striking figure
in that department.
An inspection of the tool room,
including a most careful inspection
of the aesthetic pictures on the wall,
and a short visit to the foundry con
cluded the trip. The class is very
enthusiastic about making another
field trip in the near future; "We
benefited so much from it," every
one claims.

bv Bricklin and "C. S." McElrath
Minus a field pack and rifle, the
M.E. s's felt a bit out of uniform
for their Army field trip last Friday.
However, a one man reconnaissance
patrol, Professor Shepard of the
metallurgy department, assured them
that such equipment was unneces
sary for an inspection of Joshua
Hendy's plant at Sunnyvale. The
ex-infantrymen, now turned engi
neers, found the spacious, easy-rid
ing convertibles —G.I. six wheelers—
just to their liking.
As they cruised along, talk turned
to things dear to the heart of every
engineer. A heated debate was going
on in one corner of the truck about
the engine's gear reduction system,
[n another corner there was a dis
cussion of the heat treatment of the
convertible's chassis. Then a beauti
ful brunette whizzed by and waved
—that ended the shop talk.
First on the agenda at the plant
was the showing of two films on
turbines. The fellows were impressed
by the "tornado in a box" and when
"entropy" emerged as the dominating
figure, there was a wild cheer. The
sales talk for gas turbines was very
convincing, but one I. C. Engines
student expressed the feelings of
the rest of the class when he said,
That sounds pretty good, but I'd
like to hear Professor Wiedmann's
verdict before I ever buy a gas
turbine."
There were quite a few women in
the turbine shop and their morale
sky-rocketed when they saw the
soldiers who came to watch them at
work. Of course, no trip is complete
without a demonstration of the
SCHEINEMAN STRUT.
The main attraction at Hendy's,
however, was the cutting of large
gears. It was amazing to see huge
bobbing machines controlled by
females in slacks and T shirts. The
women cut quite a striking figure
in that department.
An inspection of the tool room,

i Some E. M. have come into the
j misconception that the uniform they
j wear makes them gilt-plated Saints
j of a sort. We refer to those G.l.'s
who are becoming well-known as
j the local "hellraisers." It's an easy
thing to fall into the, "who gives a
| damm" attitude, but remember that
I every man in uniform on this cam
i pus takes it on the chin when you
! goof-off. You may not particularly
| care about what other people think
| of your actions, but the Army's repu-
I tation is always made by its loudest
j elements, and that, unfortunately,
j happens to be you. So let's get on
: the ball.
