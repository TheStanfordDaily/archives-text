## 
### JUANITA NUSSBAUM 
The Daily's only major competitor, the Chaparral, broke all previous
sales records Friday by selling out at 10:09*2 a.m. According to the Cap
pie's manager, 1.684 copies were offered for sale at 9. and by 10 all the
gorgeous salesgirls but the one in the Cellar were shouting themselves
hoarse with "Sorry, there ain't any more."

A word of solace for the many
disappointed customers was found,
however, when your reporter learned
that about 300 copics had been saved
out for sale today. They will go on
sale at noon at the Cigar Store in !
the Cellar. '"At the rate they sold
Friday, those 300 will last about 20
minutes," said the manager, "and 1
I sure hope all our friends who cut :
their Friday classes will get one. The
Old Boy and his cohorts really out- !
did themselves this time."
Asked what artists, writers, fable
spies and salesgirls got for turning 1
out such a magnificent rag, Managing
Editor Gugel winked and said. "why. !
complementary copies, of course-• if j
they have the time to go and sign ,
for them at the ASSU office. If they j
don't call for them, this manager of i
ours probably sells them to his 1
friends and buys beer with the pro- j
ceeds."
With this, your reporter began to ;
feel thirsty, and left with the Chap
pie's parting shot still in her ears:
"Don't forget to enter our big story
contest —we expect at least 50 en- i
tries, and will give serious consid- :
eration to each one."
