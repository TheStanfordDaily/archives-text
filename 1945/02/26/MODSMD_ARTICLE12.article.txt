# And the Young Men Wondered 1934-1945
## 
### 
Chappie's page of cynicism directed against
war was of a type that made us writhe slightly,
yesterday, as we read it in the calmness of Cali
fornia sun. Why? Not because we didn't agree,
but because it was such a familiar strain, one
that we'd read just a few hours before in the
hurried style of a Stanford Daily editor in 1934.
Yes, while journeying through the old Daily
files, we had been stopped by an editorial of
November 26, 1934. Its title asked us, "Who's
to Pay for the Second, World War?" And here
is how it posed the question:
"The war threat to world peace continues;
and the diplomats continue to scurry, rat-like,
from conference to conference, arguing, gestic
ulating, begging, promising, in unheeded efforts
to dam the surging flood of world armament.
It seems that the old men of government never
learned the lesson of 1918; otherwise, why do
they permit the madness to go on? It is certain
that the young men have learned the lesson;
where, we know not; but they are insistent that
rationality, not blood and iron, shall conquer.
"Europe reeks with tension, while the League
of Nations daily retrogresses to a more futile
status, unable to police two minor nations, states
of South America, at present engaged in minia
ture mortal combat of the one-horse variety.
France and Russia are popularly believed to
have reached a defensive accord; Mussolini
trains his warriors from the cradle; the madmen
of Berlin persist in power; and the inter-racial
struggle in south-central Europe smoulders dan
gerously.
"England, Japan, and the United States are
at loggerheads over the naval ratio; and while
Japan announces the greatest war appropriation
in history, Washington rushes its project for a
battle fleet 'second to none.'
"The young men look on incomprehensive,
waiting, wondering if it's going to be their
show, or if the Second World War can be de
ferred to the generation that comes after. Many
of them ponder the question, 'Where's the
money coming from '
"The common plea is 'security' at any price.
God grant that we all get it. The very ferocity
implied in armed readiness inay deter us all,
but some day someone may have to make good
the bluffN. S.

Chappie's page of cynicism directed against
war was of a type that made us writhe slightly,
yesterday, as we read it in the calmness of Cali
fornia sun. Why? Not because we didn't agree,
but because it was such a familiar strain, one
that we'd read just a few hours before in the
hurried style of a Stanford Daily editor in 1934.
Yes, while journeying through the old Daily
files, we had been stopped by an editorial of
November 26, 1934. Its title asked us, "Who's
to Pay for the Second, World War?" And here
is how it posed the question:
"The war threat to world peace continues;
and the diplomats continue to scurry, rat-like,
from conference to conference, arguing, gestic
ulating, begging, promising, in unheeded efforts
to dam the surging flood of world armament.
It seems that the old men of government never
learned the lesson of 1918; otherwise, why do
they permit the madness to go on? It is certain
that the young men have learned the lesson;
where, we know not; but they are insistent that
rationality, not blood and iron, shall conquer.
"Europe reeks with tension, while the League
of Nations daily retrogresses to a more futile
status, unable to police two minor nations, states
of South America, at present engaged in minia
ture mortal combat of the one-horse variety.
France and Russia are popularly believed to
have reached a defensive accord; Mussolini
trains his warriors from the cradle; the madmen
of Berlin persist in power; and the inter-racial
struggle in south-central Europe smoulders dan
gerously.
