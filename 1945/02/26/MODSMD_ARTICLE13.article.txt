ME. ANTHONY, WE . . .
There are several young men on campus
who are bothered with problems. Some are
trying to remember the name of that girl in
their Western Civ class. Others are trying to
forget the name of that girl in their Western
Civ class.
But there is one young man about Stanford
who, because of an unusual magnetism, has a
very different problem. In his own words, this
young man is "one of the few people on campus
who has an access to an unlimited supply of
gasoline." He is also one of the few people on
:ampus who has access to a car.
To comb the campus for customers would
uean a great sacrifice of Cellar, boathouse and
lighway time. There would be the building of
j hideaway for clandestine meetings, the esta
blishment of a permanent residence in a tele

phone booth, and countless expenses involved
in contacting fellow delinquents.
As such machinations would net this mag
netic student but little, we are asking you, Mr.
Anthony, to recommend another campus to him.
Maybe there he can solve his problem.
