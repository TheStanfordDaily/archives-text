The Japanese are in danger of a blockade, and a peace
offensive might convince them that ending the war
is the wisest policy. But we can't write a peace allowing
her to rise as an aggressor again, or we will defeat our
own aim. Yet, it must not be an unendurable peace,
or the enemy will fight on.
Perhaps the solution to this problem might be found
in Japanese political history.
The Japanese political scene seems, on first glance,
to be a constitutional monarchy built along Western
lines, but actually government offices and the diet lias
been controlled by three groups, none of them rep
resenting the people.
The first, and oldest, is the Genro. These are pro
fessional politicians, resembling the royal advisers and
ministers of the 18th century, who have always held
seats in the diet and, until recently, had controlled all
the ministries. Their policy has always been nationalis
tic, and. to a slight extent, imperialistic, but never
jingoist. They conceived that the foundation of Japa
nese foreign policy should be good relations with the
United States and Great Britain, an active campaign
against Russian expansion in Asia, and an economic
sphere of influence in China similar to that of the
Western powers.
Secondly come the large capitalist families, such as
the Mitsubishis. They intervened in politics to protect
their monopolistic enterprises, and were for an even
milder foreign policy than the Genro, wanting peace
to build up their markets and not wanting to pay the
high taxes necessary for a strfcng military establish
ment.
Finally came the fanatical Samuri, who were late
in intervening in politics. Brilliant organizers but
nevertheless ruthless and barbaric, they were the
descendents of ancient Robber Barons and wanted to
put their family tradition into Japan's foreign policy.
Manchuria Incident
They broke into Japanese politics by stealing a leaf
out of whatever "Life of Hannibal" they had in their
libraries. They realized their power would only come
through war, and, instead of maneuvering the diet
into declaring one, they simply started it and waited
for results. Thus the Manchuria incident.
The militarists probably then expected China to
declare war and the diet, afraid of "losing face" to
simply accept what they had precipitated and back
them to the limit. But both Chiang Kai Shek and the
Genro were too clever for this.
Chiang gauged the direction and power of the com
ing storm in the Orient, and realized he had to stall
for time in order to organize his country for full scale
war. He deliberately wrote Manchuria off the books
in order to give the Japanese something that would
take them time to absorb, while he built as modern an
army as he could.
The diet realized that the militarist policy meant
ruin, and that this was no time to violate the Kellogg
Briand pact by an open declaration of war, so they
simply shelved the whole incident.
But the die was cast, and the military power was
on the increase. Money came from such reactionary
societies as the Black Dragon, and the Genro split,
some going over to the militarists because they favored
a stronger Chinese policy. A militarist ministry finally
got it.
The Japanese monopolists, at that time bitter enemies
of the militarists, seemed beaten, but they still had
some recourses. They first liquified their assets and
turned their money into good American dollars, and
then calmly proceeded to ruin the Japanese Yen.
Financial crisis hit the nation. The militarists realized
that they were in a situation that they couldn't cope
with, and resigned. Pro-monopolist ministers reorgan
ized the government, and the capitalists intervened to
re-establish national finances, which were in the palm
of their hands.
Machine-gun Persuasion
But the militarists started using their machine guns.
They decided to settle their political opposition once
and for all by simply annihilating it.and from then on,
Japanese political history read like one of our more
lurid detective stories, only the crime czars wore the
gold braided uniforms of the general staff.
The Genro gave in, or were shot, and the monopolists
realized that the only way they could make money and
keep their skins imperforated was to convert to war
industry. Everybody united behind the loud-mouthed
generals, and the present Pacific war started then.
But, after it is over, our best hope for peace is a
government based on the monopolists. It might be well
to say, let's shoot both them and the militarists, who
are collectively a very sordid lot, but such a policy must
only lead to a list of national martyrs and such choas
in the East that we'd wish we never heard of the whole
affair. Perhaps something might be done with a three
point plan such as follows:
First, Japan must be allowed to make money in the
O icnt, to be able favorably to compete with everybody
pise, so that the monopolists will resume their old
peace policy. Secondly, Japan must be ringed with
American naval l-i i 's to prevent any future expansion,
and. third, the t. o mttsl he revived so as to form
a coalition with the capitalists, against the militarists.
