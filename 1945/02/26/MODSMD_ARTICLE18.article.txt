The farewell of a noble venture . ..
On Saturday night the Palo Alto
Independents basketball team de
feated Auten's, 57 to 41. The event
in itself was of little significance; it
was the third time the Independents
had played Autens, the second time
they had beaten them. A bare dozen
Stanford students journeyed to the
Paly High Gym to see the game.
And yet in a broader sense this
game was of transcendent importance
to a vast number of Stanford men
and women, for it rang down the
curtain on a noble venture; the first
step toward the return of athletics
to the Farm.
They Played Basketball
The Independents' season record
was not particularly impressive.
They won some breathers and also
some tough ones; they lost some
close ones and some they should have
won. But they played basketball—
creditable basketball. They were
formed in the face of what I believe
to be a short-sighted administration
policy because they could not wait
for university officials to recognize
the importance of intercollegiate
competition. They could creditably
have represented Stanford on any
basketball court in the nation. They
did not. They were forced to play
under an "assumed name." But per
haps by their action they have suc
ceeded, in part at least, in showing
the Stanford administration how at
least a part of the student body feels
with regard to Stanford's continued
absence from fields of athletic com
petition.
Our Tribute
To the Palo Alto Independents—
Dave Brown, Jack Heald, Morley
Thompson, George Bowers, Ed Doug
las. Pitts, Rosburg, Chandler, Mc-
Dowell, Hood, Marquette, and the
rest—we humbly take off our hats.
Those of us—and I sincerely believe
we represent a majority of Stanford
students—who believe that it is time
for our university to take up the
banner of intercollegiate competition
once more will do our best to see
that their efforts have not been in
vain. We owe them an everlasting
debt of gratitude for showing the
world that the spirit of athletic com
petition is not dead on the Farm.
