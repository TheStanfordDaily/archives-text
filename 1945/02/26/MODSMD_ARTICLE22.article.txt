# 'Othello' Rated Excellent
## 
### 
If we liad a Little Indian review
cartoon lying flat on its back, that's
I he one we'd use for the Margaret
Webster production of Paul Robeson
as: "Othello" now at the Geary in
San Francisco.
For centuries, no less, Mr. Shake
speare of Stratford-on-Avon has
withstood every kind of butchery
and squeamish interpretation, yet,
always able to convey the essential,
universal core ol compassion and
understanding that has made un
surpassed drama.
Now, perhaps we owe it to the
sobering influence of war, there is
a production which is not afraid to
let the tragedy of "Othello" "be
played as it was written.
And what drama that man has
written! Shakespeare is acted in this
Margaret Webster production by
actors who not only interpret force
fully but who believe and know how
to act the interpretation of their
roles.
Notable among all lagos, perhaps,
is Jose Ferrer who in posture, ges
ture. voice, and look is the most un
holy, evil man who has brought
humor to the role of a villain. Ferrer
gives "Iago" the adequate interpre
tation needed to make the tragedy

of "Othello" powerfully moving. He
even hams just enough to make him
a conceited villain, and more hate
ful, if possible.
Miss Uta Hagen's Desdemona is a
studied portrayal of the role. Her
role is not that of a mature woman,
and she is understandable in the
mistakes she makes because it is
played as a young and altogether
winning woman.
The play as a whole has real acting
in every appearance, on the stage;
there arc only one or two instances
where people break into the sodden
Shakespearean error of using elocu
tion with a capital E.
I have saved Mr. Robeson until
last because the fact that Mr.
Robeson remains the star despite the

superb work of Mr. Ferrer, Miss j
Hagen, and the others, speaks for j
itself.
Mr. Robeson gives perhaps the j
greatest "Othello" we will see in j
our generation.
He is a Negro, he is noble, digni
fied. and impressive as the role- is
written. Forget that Mr. Robeson is
a Negro singer playing "Othello";
he is Othello and we don't expect I
to look upon his like again.
The only way to close this without
getting off our backs, where the
power of this drama will place any
one, raised like us on the 20th cen
tury melodrama and sentimental
tragedy, is to quote Miss Webster's |
remarks, "To us, in 1943, Cyprus and j
Venice and North Africa are no ,
strange lands; they have drawn very |
close; space and distance shrink to I
nothing. So, in the presence of I
Shakespeare's great humanity, dif- !
ference of time and manners, race j
and creed, vanish. We are in the j
presence of men and women, of our- j
selves."
