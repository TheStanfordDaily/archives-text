# Houses Rehearse Pow-Wow Skits
## 
### 
With only five days before presen
tation on the stage of the Memorial
Auditorium, Pow-Wow skits are en
tering a strenuous routine of re
hearsal—before dinner, after dinner,
and in between courses.
Ruble's offering for the evening's
entertainment will be a take-off on
"Sweet Suite Life," under the direc
tion of its author, Paula Blanchard.
Latest entrants, Russell House, wom
en plan a musical skit, which its
perpetrators term marvelous. Bran
ner's satirical corridor meeting is
being rehearsed with leading players
in black nightgowns.
Peggy Fitts, who is coordinating
the show, said that all groups wish
ing technical facilities—michrophone,
lights—should phone her at Lagunita.
Rehearsals in the Memorial Audi
torium may be arranged with Mary
Lou Patton at Jessie Jordan House.
