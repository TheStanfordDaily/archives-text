# Annual Red Cross Drive Opens Today; Stanford Asked To Contribute $3000
## 
### 
"There are two things you can
give which take almost no time or
effort; they are your blood and your
money," said Chairman Kolar, in
conjunction with Stanford's annual
| Red Cross drive which starts today.

Chairman for this year's drive,
Miss Kolar is asking every Stanford
student to contribute a minimum of
$2 to help put Stanford "over the
top" of its $3000 quota. Though this
quota will constitute only a very
small part of the national 200 million
dollar goal, Miss Kolar wants every
student to "help as much as he can"
towards the fulfillment of this vital
war need.
In Living Groups
To coordinate the drive, solicita
tions will be made at all living groups
by living group Red Cross repre
sentatives who met Friday after
noon to receive the materials and
instructions necessary for the drive.
Approximately one-third of the liv
ing groups sent no representatives
I or substitutes to this meeting, and
I Miss Kolar announced that their rep
resentatives must get their Red Cross
kits from her this morning in the
ASSU office.

Stanford's two-week drive, which
will last until March 10, is inde
pendent of the Palo Alto area drive
which will start next week. Stan
ford's solicitations include only the
students, and not members of the
faculty and administration officials
who will be included among the
contributors to help Palo Alto fill
its quota of $75,000.

Committeemen working u n d e r
Miss Kolar, and helping to promote
the success of the drive are Franky
Mclnnis, treasurer; Jack Siemer,

Begun in Europe in 1864, and made
official by the Treaty of Geneva, the
Red Cross was organized to assist
the wouyded in time of war. The
American National Association of the
Red Cross was organized in 1881 with
Clara Barton as president, and the
United States became a signatory
to the Treaty of Geneva in the fol
lowing year.
In Peace and War
Since then the American National
Red Cross has functioned both at
home and abroad in giving relief
to disaster victims in time of peace,
and in providing essential service to
our fighting men in time of war.
It maintains contact between serv
icemen fighting overseas and in
prison camps and their families at
home; gives relief to stricken fami
lies of servicemen; operates mobile
canteens, clubs, and hotels for serv
icemen on furlough both at home
and abroad; assists medical personnel
of the Army and Navy in the care,
treatment, and rehabilitation of the
wounded; and performs the all-im
portant function, of obtaining blooc
plasma for treatment of the wounded,
of collecting and shipping relief sup
plies to the peoples of nations strick
en by the war, and of countless other
services necessary to the war effort
and the peace effort.
This vast organization is financed
entirely by voluntary contributions,
and nearly all assistance is given
without charge and without expecta
tion of reimbursement.
