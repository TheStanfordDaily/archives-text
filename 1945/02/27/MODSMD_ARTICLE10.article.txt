"The success of the Red Cross j
drive depends on the success of the '
individual collectors," said Charmian j
Kolar, chairman of this year's annual j
Red Cross drive, yesterday at the j
opening of the drive.
As yet. no reports of collections j
had been submitted to Treasurer I
Frankie Mclnnis; and Miss Kolar!
announced that representatives of !
most men's living groups had not yet i
appeared to get their kits for the j
drive. Those who have nof done so
may get them in the ASSU office this j
afternoon, she said.
Contrary to the publicity and fan
fare which have hailed similar drives
in the past, Miss Kolar said, this one
is being conducted on a quiet scale

with little publicity and with no
other goal in sight than to put Stan
ford over the top in its quota of
$3,000 set for the two-week drive.
Until March 10, the last day of
the drive, Stanford students will have
a chance to help the Red Cross by
contributing the minimum, of $2
asked from every student. However,
contributions of more than this sum
will be gratefully received, said Miss
Mclnnis.
"Remember that, every $2 that you
contribute helps to pay for main
taining the Red Cross one-third of
a second," added Miss Kolar, in say
ing that the main purpose of the
drive was to surpass Stanford's quot?
as quickly and by as much as pos
sible.
Part of a national Red Cross Fund
drive which has set the national
quota at 200 million dollars, Stan
ford's drive does not include the
Palo Alto area share which hopes to
contribute $75,000 to swell the na
tional goal. Faculty and administra
tion officials will be solicited inde
pendently of the Stanford drive and
are not included with it. Stanford's
$3,000 goal must be achieved by the
students alone, and they are re
sponsible to help in fulfilling this
vital war need, said Miss Kolar.
