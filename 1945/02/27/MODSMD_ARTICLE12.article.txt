### 
i The knitting committee of the War
| Board has received a letter from
I the Friends of Belgium, an agency of
I the Belgian War Relief Society, Inc.,
| thanking the women students of
I Stanford University for their con
tribution to the relief of the stricken !
people of Belgium.
This letter emphasizes some of the !
1 appalling conditions prevailing there: j
the widespread hunger and cold, the I
lack of clothes among all classes of j
people, the terrible destruction ;
i wrought by the robot bombs, and i
| the universal unemployment result- ;
ing from the complete lack of all j
; raw materials. The entire situation i
i was mentioned, as the letter stated. |
j "in the hope that the students should
; realize that they are working for a j
cause which is real and worthy." (
"Every garment they send," con- i
i eluded the letter, "makes a human I
i happy, and contributes to better i
i understanding, over there, of the \
magnitude of the American war ef- ;
! fort."
Considering the urgency of the j
j demand, girls must not fail to finish J
j and turn in all sweaters at the War |
I Board Office on or before Monday, |
March 19.
