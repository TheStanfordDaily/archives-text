# Cellar To Close On Friday Nights
## 
### 
Since there was little demand on
the part of the students to keep the
Cellar open on Friday nights, Excom
decided to close it then and have it
open only on Monday through
Thursday nights, according to Jim
Emerson, student manager.
"Hashers for the Cellar are vol
untary and there is little purpose
in having them there on Friday
nights,when few students come to
the Cellar," Emerson said.
Tlie report of last week's unpaid
bills showed a great improvement
over the record of opening week.
