# SECURITY COUNCIL-LOCALIZED
## 
### 
The inter-American conference in Mexico
City indicates a problem in international rela
tions which is going to crop up continually in
future efforts for world-wide peace.
The nations considered a plan to keep a
world security organization after the war from
interfering in the troubles of this hemisphere
and allowing the nations, here, to settle them.
This is a fundamental problem for any kind
of postwar world organization. The great delay
that kept the League from being effective,
sprang from just such a hesitancy on the part
of nations to go half-way across the world to
interfere in other nations' business.
Naturally public sentiment rose against such
plans to send their sons away to settle business
which they did not care about, and seldom un
derstood.
We think united action of the security organ
ization is necessary, and so is a sizeable amount
of sovereignty over separate nations, such as
the American nations, have problems peculiar
to themselves and better understood by them
selves. It is sensible to recognize that the ef
fectiveness of the security organization can be
greatest if such zones are made throughout
the world where the nations within them will
be given first opportunity to act upon their
problems. If they fail the matter can be given
to the world-wide security council for action.
Such a plan is in the scheme introduced by
Mr. Sumnei Welles, and its timeliness and im
portance should be impressed upon our think
ing now, for a world security organization which
will mean what it says.
