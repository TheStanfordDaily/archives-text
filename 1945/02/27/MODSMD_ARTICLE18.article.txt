# HIGH MEN IN THE GAME

### 
With the folding of the Palo Alto Indepen
dents, the only vestige of student athletic com
petition with other schools goes into our war
time scrap book.
Even though they were pretty good, or
whether the Independents weie terrific or not is
beside the point. From our standpoint we ad
mire the guts and alertness they showed with
the kiss of death upon them from the start. If
they had really had the support of the student
body, even unofficially, it might have helped
them, but as a matter of fact there was no way
to determine how well they were supported.
We would like to say however that they have
contributed to the year at Stanford. They
showed courage and spirit, and it took a lot to
buck the coolness and unorganized inertia
which they faced.
When things are obviously not necessary
sacrifices to the war, it makes all the things that
are necessary taste more bitter.
The people who supported them, and some
quite faithfully, showed a spirit for Stanford,
win or lose, that is something for any school
to be proud of.
