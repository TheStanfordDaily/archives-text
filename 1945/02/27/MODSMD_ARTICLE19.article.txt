### Walrus the Carpenter 
The following extract is from"The Memoirs of John
3ell" published in the year 2000 A.D.
Among the severest strictures that have been passed

on my life and works is the comment that the style
in which I write conforms closely to the description,
furnished by Maeaulay, of Johnson's style. "As soon as
he took his pen in his hand to write for the public, his
style became systematically vicious. All his books are
written in a learned language, in a language which no
body hears from his mother or his nurse, in a language
in which nobody ever quarrels, or drives bargains, or
makes love, in a language in which nobody ever thinks."
In this matter of language something more must be
said. Those whose style of writing is based on a course
of newspaper reading have chosen for themselves
second rate teachers: teachers who are busy perpet
uating a tradition of hasty writing and "deuccdly p<*or
reading."
If good teachers were rare, this course might seek
its excuse in expediency. But -good teachers are not
rare. The rich heritage of thoughtful English writing
is at the disposal of all who can read.
But even this heritage must be used with discretion.
It is an embarras de richessc in which there are few
guiding principles to determine choice. It is most as
suredly misleading to lay down simple rules in this
matter. A certain school of thought eschews everything
written before the turn of the century as "out of date."
This is to neglect the sources of inspiration of the very
writers that are taken as masters. It is not hard to trace
a literary ancestry back several centuries; thus, for
instance, Bernard Shaw admits his debt to Ruskin, Rus
kin shows the influence of Johnson, Johnson's style
in turn was based on Sir William Temple's, and so
on back to the dawn of English prose writing.
There are some animals that thrive on turnip tops,
hut more intelligent ones have found that the root lias
more sustenance.
In defence of Johnson's style, and of my own which
shelters like a chick under the protective wing of the
great moralist, it may be said that the language of
mothers and nurses is not suitable outside a nursery;
that the language used in quarreling, in driving bar
gains and in making love are all equally restricted, and
that the language in which, one thinks may be unin
telligible to others.
While not advocating a general return to the style
of Johnson yet there are passages of unmatched sub
limity in his writings, where the breadth and dignity of
the subject demand the same qualities in its description.
Here the easy, informal style seems out of place and
even wisdom assumes the aspect of frivolity and ir
relevance.
In the long run personal preference plays its part
and when the choice is between Johnsonese and
journalese that man with the greater respect for his
native tongue will take the former.
