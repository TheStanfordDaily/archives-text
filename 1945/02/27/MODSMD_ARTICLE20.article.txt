The battle of the West Wall drags on. Again the
tactical picture has changed, and General Eisenhower
has his best opportunity so far, because the enemy is
being tied down to so great an extent in the East.
Our strategy is simple. We are out to take this ad
vantage and smash the enemy lines once and for all,
breaking into the German hinterland.
German Problem
The German defense is, of course, based on the pow
erful works of the Siegfried Line. But his main prob
lem is caused by his weakness.
If he can dig enough men into any sector, he can
stop a large-scale drive on a narrow front by virtue
of the defensive power of his pillboxes. But several
drives on a wide front present a different situation. He
has no way of knowing which one is our main effort,
and which is simply a feint. Also, while he might hurt
one, he could not prevent the rest from making dan
gerous progress.
Four or five drives on about a 20-mile front can well
have as much momentum as one on the same frontage,
but employing everything we have, since, in the latter
case, there is little room for deployment and for full
utilization of fire power.
Our Tactics
Our tactics, then, were to force the Germans to spread
their strength out and then launch multiple drives. If
they concentrated again, or if they stayed spread out,
they would still be in danger of defeat.
At the beginning of the new action, enemy power was
lumped at the southern end of the line. Von Runsteadt
hoped to break General Patch's lines and force our
troops to concentrate facing him. Of course, he would
have lost the resulting battle, but he could have drawn
us back into the Black Forest where a light force could
hold us while the rest was shifted east.
But General Patch held, and then Marshal Mont
gomery launched an attack at the extreme northern
end ol the line. Some of his troops slanted out southeast
from Nijmegen, capturing Kleve and pushing into Goch.
The Siegfried Line was breached, and the Germans
committed valuable armor, plugging the gap.
This left the German flanks relatively strong, but
their reserves were tied down there. The center was
thus left unguarded, which is where General Eisen
hower is committing his main forces now. The enemy
could well be ruined if his center is pierced. This is
the most, devastating maneuver a general on the of
fensive can attempt, as the history of many Napoleonic
battles .showed.
If Eisenhower succeeds, then the enemy will have
to retreat in two detached fragmen' , or risk being
beaten in detail by our still united forces. In addition,
(lie weather on the verge of clearing 011 the
Western front, letting our tactical air forces do then
job again. The Germans ate really facing a new .
crisis.
