# Phi Psi's To Tangle With Cougars Tonight
## 
### 
With nothing less than the Roble 1
Basketball League pennant going to
the winner, tonight's headliner finds :
the Cougars, an Army outfit, chal
lenging the powerful Phi Psi's for
undisputed leadership of the Tues
day night league and probably the •
championship to boot.
With the tip-off slated for 8:15 in
Em-ina Gym, the Cougars will dump !
all their hopes on their sensational
point-maker, "Red"' Prescott, to pidl
them through. Coupled with Prescott
are two of the steadiest hall handlers
in the league. Catlett and Walker.
These boys will have to be at their
best tonight if they plan to upset the
favored Phi Psi quint.
Victors over the powerful Betas
two weeks ago, the Phi Psi bunch
boasts three top-notchers — Tom
Ashley, Tom Hood, and Luke Pitts.
But the rest of the fivesome, con
sisting of Bob Nesbit and Dick Mar
quette is equally impressive. With
such an array as this, the Phi Psi's
are slight favorites to nab tonight's
fracas and with it the first place
honors, for only the Cougars have a
record good enough to stand up
alongside the frat men.
Fans trekking to the game will see
as good a brand of basketball as can
be produced on the campus. Onlook
ers at the Beta-Phi Psi struggle of
a few weeks ago plan to return for
a second dose tonight.
Other games tonight find the Med. |
