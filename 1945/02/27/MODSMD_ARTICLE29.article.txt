Newly-appointed its director, F. ]
Philler Curtis led the Stanford band !
—a majority of Army students, a I
sprinkling of civilian men and worn- j
en—for the first time in a perform
ance before the student body at |

Tuesday's Tradition Day Assembly.
Mr. Curtis, dean of Interdale
: School, has taken over the position
of band director, which Dr. Jan Pop
per vacated, in the hopes of develop
ing at Stanford a concert band on a
par with many of those in Eastern
j universities. To build a band which
| is not merely a football band, but
j a concert band of fine quality will
require the cooperation and interest
s of civilian students, since those Army

students who are members at present
will leave in the regular Army turn
over at the end oi' two quarters.
"Students should appreciate ihe
opportunity to work with such an
outstanding man." said Dr. Popper.
Mr. Curtis* hopes for the band can
be best fulfilled if civilian students
will join with the expectation of
continuing as members, so that to
gether with the director, they may
build up the desired quality over
a period of time. Dr. Popper urges
that students throw away any per
judice they may have in regard to
playing in a band.
Composer, conductor and teacher,
Mr. Curtis received • most of his
musical training abroad, as the pupil
of such men as Alexander G retch
aninov, Ottorino Resphigi, and
Charles Widor. He came to the West
Coast from the Cranbrook Founda
tion in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan,
where for the past nine years, he
was the musical director.
A specialist in woodwind instru
ments, Mr. Curtis has also been guest
conductor of orchestras in most of
the principal cities of Europe. He
is the editor of Manuscript Music
Editions, publishers of chamber
music.
Mr. Curtis, as assistant in music,
will give only part time to music
work at Stanford, since he is also
Interdale's dean. He invites any stu
dents who have had band experience
to attend meetings at 5:15 p.m. on
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons in
the Band building.
