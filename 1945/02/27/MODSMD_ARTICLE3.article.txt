# Conference Considers New Late Leave Plans
## 
### 
Alice Webb, chairman of the Two O'clock Late Leave Committee, sub
mitted the committee's plan to Women's Conference yesterday which was
to be voted upon last night in house meetings.
The plan consists of: five 2 a.m. special leaves for every woman student
that can bo taken in place of any ordinary 1:30 leave, Saturday night or

floater, during each quarter. New'
Lower Division women and students
who are minus will receive two 2
a.m. cultural leaves per quarter
which can be taken in the middle
of the week, and three 2 a.m. special
leaves which they can take in place
of any of their regular Saturday 1:30
leaves.
If passed, the plan will go into ef
fect next quarter on a trial basis. It
will be noted where students are
taking their special leaves and if any
complications arise from them. If
this plan is established, it will be
expressly for special dates in the
city.
No special permission from Wom
en's Council will be necessary. A
new sign-up slip for 2 a.m. leaves
will be provided.
Late leave quotas will remain the
same: Lower Division women will
have five 1:30 floaters per quarter
and a 1:30 leave every Saturday
night, and Upper Division women
will have two 1:30 leaves per week
plus five floaters per quarter. Two
o'clock specials will just replace
these.
B. J. Rucker, president of W.A.A.,
announced that there will be a party
to close the basketball season next
Tuesday in the gym at 7:30 p.m. The
winners of the Tuesday and Thurs
day Leagues will play off at this
time, and the game will be followed
by the Pathe News Reel showing
Stanford women's sports and re
freshments. Sports representatives
from each house are asked to sign
up in the gym before Thursday the
number of people coming from their
house.
