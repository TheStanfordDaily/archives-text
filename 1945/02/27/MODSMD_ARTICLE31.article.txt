# Guerard Discusses Role Of France in Postwar
## 
### 
"Constitutional reforms in post
war France will probably tend
toward a strengthening of the execu
i tive power in post-war France with
DeGaulle the most likely candidate
for the immediate holder of this
power," said Professor Albert Guer
ard, in speaking on France before
Debating Society last night-
Professor Guerard answered ques
tions on all phases of current French
problems, with emphasis on subjects
relative to this year's Joffre debate
topic, "The Role of France in the
Post-War World."
In discussing constitutional re
forms, Dr. Guerard mentioned the
division of executive and legislative
power as originally defined by Mont
'■ esqieu and called "deplorable" the
later tendency for executive powers
I to be taken over by legislative
bodies.
Saying that the congress in France
could be completely abolished with
out serious loss, he cautioned that
! executive control could result in
dictatorship without the check of a
' body such as a Supreme Court which
would bring dubious bills to the
i direct vote of the people through
, referendum.
I Speaking of France's future as a
world power, Dr. Guerard said that
' the influence of France will be great
er than many countries now realize,
j adding that France is looking beyond
leadership in a Balance of Power
system, a policy which inevitably
leads to war because of rivalry be
tween the nations involved.
Questioned about France's colonial

i policy. Dr. Guerard said that the
j situation varies in the case of each
j of France's possessions, and enlarg
j ing upon the situation in Syria, said
I that France would be willing to
1 abandon the mandate provided such
action did not merely exchange
i French for British influence.
I Asked about the so-called deep
i rooted French hatred of Germany,
! Dr. Guerard pointed out that if such
i feeling exists it dates only from 1871
I and that if France has a "traditional"
i enemy, it is England.
Dr. Guerard explained DeGaulle's
action in refusing the recent invita
tion of President Roosevelt as being
in answer to the "snubs" DeGaulle
has received in not being invited to
attend the last three conferences of
the United Nation's leaders.

Saying that the congress in France
could be completely abolished with
out serious loss, he cautioned that
! executive control could result in
dictatorship without the check of a
' body such as a Supreme Court which
would bring dubious bills to the
i direct vote of the people through
, referendum.
I Speaking of France's future as a
world power, Dr. Guerard said that
' the influence of France will be great
er than many countries now realize,
j adding that France is looking beyond
leadership in a Balance of Power
system, a policy which inevitably
leads to war because of rivalry be
tween the nations involved.
Questioned about France's colonial

i policy. Dr. Guerard said that the
j situation varies in the case of each
j of France's possessions, and enlarg
j ing upon the situation in Syria, said
I that France would be willing to
1 abandon the mandate provided such
action did not merely exchange
i French for British influence.
I Asked about the so-called deep
i rooted French hatred of Germany,
! Dr. Guerard pointed out that if such
i feeling exists it dates only from 1871
I and that if France has a "traditional"
i enemy, it is England.
Dr. Guerard explained DeGaulle's
action in refusing the recent invita
tion of President Roosevelt as being
in answer to the "snubs" DeGaulle
has received in not being invited to
attend the last three conferences of
the United Nation's leaders.
