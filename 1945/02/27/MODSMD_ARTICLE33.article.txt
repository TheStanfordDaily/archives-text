# Bower, Daily Critic, Leaves Through Stanford 'Window'
## 
### 
WOMAN IN THE WINDOW—Now playing at the Stanford Theater.
It's Edward G. Robinson again in ''Woman in the Window," this tim
as a harassed college professor who, together with satiny Joan Bennett,
has killed a man under exceedingly strange circumstances.

"Woman in the Window" develops
into a neat psychological study
of Miss Bennett and Robinson be
coming entangled in their own web
of crime. Also present is one Dan

Duryea, who
combines black
mail and sex in
a fascinating and
vie ious manner
that marks him
as a real find.
There's also
some very effec
tive satire — no
tably the not so

playful poke at crack-pot radio ad
vertising. The film remains a suave
and slick effort until the so-called
"trick" ending is reached. Never has
Hollywood perpetrated such a hoax
upon the American public.
The second "feature" (?) is
"Alaska," a story of the frozen North
that will leave you numb with bore
dom.
Because of reasons too numerous
to mention, this reviewer ceases his
childish babblings for The Daily with
the above attempt. During the past
months this department has been
called "incompetent," "chintzie,"
"drunken," and "frustrated." Our
only reason for existence has been
to sharpen your critical appetite—
if it is necessary to acquire such
titles in the process, we feel deeply
gratified.
Now we'll say "thanks" for your
attention, and express the rather
futile hope that better pictures will
be produced in the future by an
industry that has made a MOUSE
hero of the world.—Dick Bower.
