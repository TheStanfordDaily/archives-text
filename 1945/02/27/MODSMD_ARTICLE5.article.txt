# Chairmen Plan 'Olympic Day'
## 
### 
Joe Slier, "Our Hasher" of The
Daily, will be master of ceremonies
of the gala "Olympic Day" planned
for Saturday, March 10 on the sunk
en diamond. B. J. Rucker and Dick
Crane are co-chairmen.
Competition will be by classes with
special rooting sections planned.
Class colors will be worn in the
sections—frosh green, the sophomore
orange, the blue of the junior class,
and the senior cardinal. Prizes will
be given to the winning class or
classes. Pat Dana and Marian Bush,
junior class officers are in charge
of prizes.
Entries must be turned in by
March 5. Names of those in charge of
entries for each class will be an
nounced in The Daily.
Strength, skill, endurance—all will
be factors in the various events.
Marathon races, or the prospect of
same, should send all Stanford
Roughs into arduous training, forti
fied occasionally by steak and reeb.
"Sad sacks" will be right at home in
the graceful and swift-paced sack
race. And those fiends on wheels,
those ball-bearing Stanford cyclists,
will at last have their chance, ac
cording to Barbara Burroughs, pub
licity manager.
