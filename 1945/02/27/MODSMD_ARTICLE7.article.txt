! PARIS. Feb. 27 (UP).—An Ameri- J
| can steam roller otfensive swept
! across the Rhineland plain to within
! 10 l 2 miles of Cologne last night as
! the Germans, fell back five to seven
miles all along a 150-mile front under
: the blows of four mighty Allied
j Armies.
The greatest drama of the day
; centered in the drive for Cologne, j
I Germany's fourth city, whose ancient ;
cathedral spiles were visible to j
American forces and which was now
| within range of powerful American j
j "super long tons" artillery, assuming j
: it kept pace with the spearheads.
The Western front blazed with
| action from the First Canadian Army i
j on the north to the American Third
■ Army on the south.
