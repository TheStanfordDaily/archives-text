# Women Vote 'Yes' on 2 A.M. Late Leaves
## 
### 
Women students voted almost
unanimously for the adoption of the
new 2 a.m. late leave plan in their
house meetings Monday night, ac
cording to Alice Webb, chairman of
the late leave committee.
The plan will not be officially
adopted, however, until it is ap
proved by Women's Conference next
Monday. If passed, it will go into ef
fect next quarter on a trial basis. It
is being worked out for the benefit
of students having dales in the city
in order that they may not be re
quired to leave unreasonably early.
The plan provides for: five 2 a.m.
special leaves for every woman stu
dent that can be taken in place of
any ordinary 1:30 leave, Saturday
night or floater, during each quar
j ter. New Lower Division women and
j students who are minus will receive
j two 2 a.m. cultural leaves which can
; be taken during the week, and three
2 a.m. special leaves which can be
| substituted for any of their regular
Saturday 1:30 leaves.
No special permission from Wom
! en's Council will be necessary to
| take these leaves. Students will sign
| out on a new slip which is being
i provided for 2 a.m. leaves.
Late leave quotas will remain the
same. Lower Division women will
j have five 1:30 floaters per quarter
I and a 1:30 leave every Saturday
' night, and Upper Division women
| will have two 1:30 leaves per week
j plus five floaters per quarter.
