# TIME FOR REVISION
## 
### 
Tonight Excom is semi-officially pledged to
a thorough consideration of both the nominating
system and a plan to reorganize the system of
representation of student government. Some
decisions should be reached tonight on these
problems or this guarter will pass without any
constructive action being taken on them.
All students who realize the difficulties of
the present system or who are wary of changes,
can be helpful if they will attend.
Both representation and nominating systems
concern efforts to get more good people into
all positions of student government. In the ma
chinery of the plan itself, a student-wide re
sponsibility to our government is desired. Peti
tioning, if seriously and sufficiently done for
both men and women, would be better than
any "top-to-the-bottom" filling in of ballots by
a nominating committee.
One plan to help this is to have a period for
petitioning extend two or more days, printing
the results each day. This would encourage
people to run for offices in which they saw
weak or unsatisfactory candidates. The present
system keeps the ballot a secret until a few
hours before we are asked to vote.
The system of representation, now deplorably
bad, reaches farther than the mere filling of
chairs around the Excom table in the plan under
consideration. It seeks to reorganize the rep
resentation in such a way that the machinery
of communication is tightened and made ef
fective.
By a system of indirect election of the Excom
members, it aims toward a selective body,
whose members would be links in a chain of
definitely responsible positions that reach from
the top officers directly lo the students.
This may be considered through a plan, al
ready much discussed in The Daily, to reorgan
ize representation from the living group rather
than the class, and lo have officers from houses
of a living group unit elect a member of Excom
who would be responsible to them, and for
whom they would in turn be accountable to
their house members.
We have stated these plans as we favor them
and other positions are known. They are im
portant; a little consideration of them reveals
the intimate effect they can have upon student
life. However, it does demand consideration to
determine this, and it demands more consider
ation to determine if the effect will be desirable
or not. That is the problem which will be con
sidered tonight; bring or send a proponent or
opponent of these ideas.
