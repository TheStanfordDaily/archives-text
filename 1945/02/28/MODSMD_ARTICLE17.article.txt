LUCK BEFORE YOU LEAP
Do you carry a silver dollar for luck? Do you
refuse to take a final without having a penny
in your shoe? Do you have an attachment for
dn expired bike license?
fou don't- Then, perhaps today's session will
nelp you to choose a talisman or develop an
eccentricity of your own.
When he was hitch-hiking from Arizona to

Los Angeles three years ago, Servet Duran,
president of the International Club, bought a
hand-carved ring from an old Indian. The Indian
told him that that the arrow on the ring was for
protection; the thunder bird for luck. Servet
has worn it ever since.
Another ring fancier is Miss Clarke, director
of Roble. She has worn her Stanford ring since
her freshman days in Roble.
There are some students and faculty mem
bers who admit having "coin guirks." Mexican
coins jingle in Avey Quinn's purse. Bill Gilbert,
Chappie business manager, carries a 1913 Eng
lish penny in his pocket; Nan Belcher has a
Canadian dollar in her wallet; and Dr. Ralph
Lutz, professor of history still has a coin which
he picked up in Europe 25 years ago.
But, good luck money pieces need not be
foreign as Miss Weed, faculty adviser to the
Tennis Club, points out. Miss Weed carries an
1898 American silver dollar, which was given to
her by her grandfather to remind her of the
Seattle fire of that year.
As finals approach, good luck charms should
be polished and prepared for their over-time
jobs. Jane Frasier composer of P. O. Blues rec
ommends a locket which she wears only during
finals week. Mary Jane Bull has been filling
bluebooks with the same Eversharp pencil for
two years. Mr. Dayton Phillips, of history, re
calls his undergraduate day when he wore his
"lucky necktie" to each exam. More unusual
is the finals charm used by Peggy Fitts, co
ordinator of the all-campus Pow-Wow. Before
going into a final, Peggy flips a penny and lets
it roll away. It works, too.
Continuing in the unusual, Bill Adams, Daily
Sports Editor, carried an ace of spades for three
years.
A good luck charm—the luck of which may
be doubted—which has been handed down with
the keys to the Shack from Daily Editor to Daily
Editor is a matrix from a Linotype machine. This
matrix has been missing from the Journalism
department for years. This statement will prob
ably land us in jail.
A little gold shamrock has never been out of
Mr. Gunther's possession since it was given to
him 35 years ago. You can see it on his watch
chain the next time you buy cigarettes from him
in the Cellar store. "The link must be repaired
every six or seven years," says Mr. Gunther,
"but its luck has never worn out."
Did you know that Miss Anastasia Doyle, di
rector of women's residences, always gets on
her kill-o-cycle from the right side?
Or that Barbara White, ASSU president, car
ries in a suit pocket the Chicago to San Francisco
time-table which she used on her way to Stan
ford as a freshman?
Miss Mary Jane Donalson, director of Union
Residence, admits that for the past nine years
she has carried in her wallet a fingerprint iden
tification card — signed by the Chief of the
Claremont Police. Miss Donalson admits that she
has never used it, but keeps it with her just in
case.
The next afternoon you spend at the Lake,
notice A 1 Marguez's white and red trunks. He
has been life-guarding in white trunks with red
trimmings for the past five years.
James Lawson, carilloneur, wore an ivory
elephant on his dog tag when he was in the
Army. Another service charm is the bracelet
worn by Mrs. Sterling of the bookstore. One
of the charms is a Marine insigne which she
wears for her son who is now on Iwo Jima.
Favorite keepsake of Dr. Tresidder is a 6-
inch ski figure made 15 years ago by the Aus
tralian artist, Colin Wyatt.
Johnny High has kept the pair of white sox
which he wore as the Archbishop of Rheims
in St. Joan, his first big part on a Stanford stage.
When asked what good luck piece or custom
he had, Tony, reliable handy man of the Wom
en's Gym replied, "My luck? It is no good. I
have given up lookin' for good luck."
Tony, your luck may not be good. But ours
is in having you.
