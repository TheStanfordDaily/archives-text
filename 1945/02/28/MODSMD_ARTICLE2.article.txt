# Yanks Enter Ruhr Basin In Drive Toward Rhine
## 
### 
PARIS. Wednesday, Feb. 28. â€”
General Dwight Eisenhower's all-out
drive for the Rhine crashed on
through demoralized German de
fenses yesterday as American tanks
and infantry broke into the Ruhr
Basin and roared up to the Erft
River line, last natural barrier be
fore Cologne.
Smashing half the German
strength on the Rhineland plain in
five days, the U. S. Ninth Army
turned the main weight of its as
sault against the Ruhr to the north.
Its progress was cloaked under a
seeyrity blackout which usually ac
companies complete disorganization
of enemy forces.
More than 55 fortified German
towns were overrun and thousands
of prisoners taken in a breakthrough
of German lines comparable to that
made by the U. S. Third Army when
it raced across France and liberated
Paris.
