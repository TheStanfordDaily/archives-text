# Cougars Edge Out Phi Psi's
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
The Cougars lived up to previous
standards to unexpectedly defeat the
Phi Psi's in a 2<»-24 thriller. Eugene
Woo. stellar Cougar forward, was
unstoppable as he swished through
12 points to he high scorer. After
walloping the Beta squad 25-7 last
week, the Army outfit was picked
as the only team to heat the frater
nity quintet and did.
The game was close all the way
and was one of the best
that has been played all season. The
half time was 14-12 in favor of the
Cugars and they managed to keep
their lead all the way in the second
half to win out in the end. The de
fensive work o'f both teams was
magnificent. The Cougars accom
plished what had heretofore been
impossible—the bottling up and stop
ping of the Phi Psi offense, and the
Phi Psi team almost did the same
to their opponents.
This win for the Cougars gives
them a top spot in the Rohlc League
with the only other undefeated tehm
being the Royal Flush squad, also
an Army team. A play-off will prob
ably be held in the near future.
In a surprisingly close game, the
Betas edged out the Buchanan Bear
cats 20-18. The Beta quintet finally
overcame the jinx that has seen
them lose three games in a row.
High point honors went to Morley
Thompson of the Betas and Frank
Hoffman of the Bearcats with 12 and
10 points respectively.
In the only contest of the evening
the Royal Flush made a strong show
ing in the second half to defeat a
battling Arguello Cardinal squad by
a score of 30-23. It was an extremely
fast game with both teams breaking
down the floor with amazing speed,
and a majority of the points were
made in this manner.
Through their triumph the Army
quintet grabbed an even tighter hold
Sn the tie for first place that they
share with the Cougars. The splendid
under the basket work of Evans,
Royal Flush center, netted him 13
digits and top points honors for the
night. At half time the score was
knotted at 16 all, when the Army
team lost their speedy forward
Maxie Bauer. This, however, did not
hinder them, for Manning, a sub
stitute forward, came through with
three timely buckets to practically
cinch things for the victors.

magnificent. The Cougars accom
plished what had heretofore been
impossible—the bottling up and stop
ping of the Phi Psi offense, and the
Phi Psi team almost did the same
to their opponents.
This win for the Cougars gives
them a top spot in the Rohlc League
with the only other undefeated tehm
being the Royal Flush squad, also
an Army team. A play-off will prob
ably be held in the near future.

Hoffman of the Bearcats with 12 and
10 points respectively.
In the only contest of the evening
the Royal Flush made a strong show
ing in the second half to defeat a
battling Arguello Cardinal squad by

fast game with both teams breaking
down the floor with amazing speed,
and a majority of the points were
made in this manner.
Through their triumph the Army
quintet grabbed an even tighter hold
Sn the tie for first place that they
share with the Cougars. The splendid
under the basket work of Evans,
Royal Flush center, netted him 13
digits and top points honors for the
night. At half time the score was
knotted at 16 all, when the Army
team lost their speedy forward
Maxie Bauer. This, however, did not
hinder them, for Manning, a sub

three timely buckets to practically
cinch things for the victors.
The Cougars lived up to previous
standards to unexpectedly defeat the
Phi Psi's in a 2<»-24 thriller. Eugene
Woo. stellar Cougar forward, was
unstoppable as he swished through

week, the Army outfit was picked
as the only team to heat the frater
nity quintet and did.

that has been played all season. The
