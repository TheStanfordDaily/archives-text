# Hurlburt, Roth Take Lead In Farm Red Cross Drive
## 
### 
With two days of the Red Cross !
drive already past, only two living
groups have turned in their dona
tions to the annual fund, according
to Frankie Mclnnis, treasurer. They
are Hurlburt House (Alpha Phi) and
Roth House (Gamma Phi Beta) who
both went 100 per cent with $102
and $52 respectively.
Their money put Stanford $154
toward its $3,000 goal which it must
achieve by March 10, the end of
the drive, said Miss Mclnnis. She
urged other living groups to turn in
their donations as soon as possible,
and announced that all off-campus
students may turn in their money to
her at the ASSU office.
Everyone Asked
Charmian Kolar, chairman for the
drive, has asked every student to
contribute at least $2 to the fund.
(Two dollars is enough money to
finance the Red Cross for one-third
of a second.) "What with midterms
I upon us, and finals coming up, we
| are trying to avoid too much cam
! paigning," Miss Kolar said, "but
j there are two things almost everyone
; can give that require little time or
i effort. They are your blood and your
I money."
She added that the need for blood
plasma is steadily increasing. The
I Red Cross takes blood by a simple,
| easy process, packages the plasma
! or whole blood, and ships it overseas
: and to relief points where it is need-
I ed. To do all this with one pint of
i blood requires approximately $100.
Blood Plasma
Recently the Army and Navy have
I asked the Red Cross to supply typed
j whole blood for shipment by plane
i for special transfusions on the bat-
I tlcfronts. Between March 1944 and
March 1945 approximately 5 million

| pints of blood have been donated to
; help speed the recovery of our
j wounded fighting men. A quick
| transfusion of plasma has often been |
| the means by which the life of a j
wounded soldier or sailor was saved, j
Every Stanford student can take i
! a direct part in relieving the suffer- I
I ing of the men on the battlefronts ;
j by making an appointment today at I
the War Board office for the next j
j Blood Bank day. If anyone is unable I
| to do so, he can help as much by J
giving his money to further the
i success of this vital project.
