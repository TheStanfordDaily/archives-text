# Group Reviews Housing Plans
## 
### 
Members of Stanford's Housing
Committee, appointed to consider
j plans for future women's housing,
' submitted the opinion last night that
I all classes in living groups should
be distributed on a proportionate
] basis.
Possible plans considered at the
; meeting for a solution to the housing
problem, or conversion of former
I sorority houses into University liv
ing units, included the establishment
of a central committee to which liv
ing groups could submit a list each
I quarter of the number of women
needed to fill the quota. The list of
vacancies would be made public and
women could sign for the unit pre
ferred.
Debated, with no positive decision,
. was the suggestion that living groups
| submit to the committee a list of
I the girls they would like to have
live in the unit. An attempt would
then be made by the committee to
I match this list, which would remain
private, with the list of living group
j preferences.
Included in the discussion were
questions such as "What makes con
geniality in group* living?" "What
makes group responsibility?" Em
j phasis was placed on the importance
of acquainting freshmen with the
present systems of group living and
j the responsibilities connected with
i each.
Committee members discussed the
necessity of a social program to ac
quaint freshmen with upper classmen
j and their living units.
Next meeting is scheduled for
Thursday night and will be open to
the public for further suggestions
and criticisms on housing plans.
