# Sher To Emcee At Campus Show
## 
### 
Joe Slier will be emcee at tomorrow night's all-campus, competitive
Puw-Wow in the Memorial Auditorium at 8 p.m., Peggy Fitts, chairman,
has announced. Aiding Sher in coordinating the program will be a board
of four judgesâ€”Blossom Parke, Corky Wollman, Ram's Head president,
Miss Fitts, and Dick Fayram, Cardinal's president.

From the 30 entrants, these judges
will selcct and award prizes to the
group presenting the best-done, the

funniest and the
most original
skits. Each group
participating will
remain in the
audience until
its turn on the
stage; students
who are auditing
the Pow-Wow
rather than act
ing in any of the
stunts will par-

ticipate in the

heckling or the applause.
In recent interviews, Miss Fitts
has been arranging the running order
of the show with group chairmen.
Musical numbers like those of the
Chalet, Lathrop, Washington and
Russell House, will dot the program
of dramatic skits, some of which are
to be given by Naranja, Sequoia,
Granada, and Madrono.
Suggested by Cardinals, coordi
nated by Ram's Head, and performed
entirely by student groups, the Pow-
Wow may become a winter quarter
tradition similar to the Spring Sing.
Whereas groups entering the Sing
represent a specific living group,
Pow-Wow entrants are members of
any group, actually or temporarily
organized.
Winners of the show will be an
nounced as soon as possible after
the final performance as Hammer
and Coffin members or Emcee Sher
fill in the waiting period.
Rehearsals may still be arranged
in the Memorial Auditorium with
Mary Lou Patton at Jessie Jordan
House, whereas technical facilities
may be requested from Miss Fitts.
All students and faculty members
are urged to attend the show, which
was organized primarily to offer the
entire campus an opportunity to get
together informally and participate
in a campus-wide activity. "With the
talent guaranteed to the show by
the various group chairmen, a good
time is virtually assured to all," Miss
Fitts said.
