# Henry George Subject Of Symposium Today
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
Mr. Charles A. Barker, associate
j professor of history, was on leave
| since July of last year until the be
j ginning of the present quarter doing
I research on the life and work of
j Henry George, and at today's Ameri
| can Studies Symposium meeting will
| use this information in attempting to
i point out the California derivation
| of George's social thought.
Mr. Barker's field is the history
of American thought and American
sociological thought particularly. Be
cause of this interest and the proxi
mity of adequate and valuable ma
terial on the life of Henry George,
Mr. Barker has undertaken a biog
j raphy of the eminent social re
former of the 19th century. He ex-
I pects to complete it within the next
' few years. During his six-months
leave he was engaged in research at
the Huntington Library in Southern
California.
George, <*r«*>«t Reformer
Henry George was a nationally
j and internationally known political
I philosopher and reformer and spent

[ only 20 years of his life in California.
But among the views of George
which Mr. Barker intends to present
in his book and in his talk today is
that many of George's ideas had their
beginnings in his observations and
experiences while he lived in and
around San Francisco. George's book,
"Progress and Poverty," presenting
bus single-tax scheme, was published
in 1870 while George was in Cali
fornia.
Mr. Barker will maintain that al
though George's plans were subject
to general application many of them
were essentially products of his Cali
ornia training.
Barker Here 12 Years
Mr. Barker has been at Stanford
since 1933. He is a graduate of Yale
and received his Ph. D. there in
1932. He has been a member of the

lege, Mills College and the New
York State College for Teachers.

ties department which is sponsoring
