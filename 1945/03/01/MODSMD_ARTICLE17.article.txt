# Red Cross Drive Lags
## Chairmen To Turn in Money Now; Quota $2 Per Student 
### 
"Regardless of whether or not the living groups have hit 100 per cent
in the Red Cross drive yet, we would like to have their representatives
start turning in the money immediately," announced Charmian Koiar,
drive chairman, yesterday.
With yesterday's drive totals amounting to 0, and the total donations

yet received from two campus liv
ing groups amounting to only $154,
a special plea was issued by Treas
urer Franky Mclnnis for representa
tives who had not yet gotten their
kits to pick them up in the A.S.S.U.
office as soon as possible.
She added that she will be in the
A.S.S.U. office from 4 to 5 Monday
afternoons, and from 3 to 5 Tuesday
through Friday afternoons to receive
the donations from living groups and
from off-campus students for the
balance of the two-week drive.

Stanford is asking every student
to contribute a minimum of $2 to the
annual fund, the quota of which is
this year set at $200,000,000. Stan
ford has been assigned to supply
$3,000 of this amount. As faculty
and administration officials will be
solicited during the Palo Alto area
drive for this national fund, Stan
lord's contribution will come from
the students alone.

"I don't need to tell the Stanford
students what an outstanding job
the American Red Cross is doing,
especially in this time of war. No
other organization has surpassed
its fine record of humanitarian
service. The Red Cross deserves
the support of every one of us at
Stanford," said Dr. Donald f>.
Tresidder.

"Our main purpose in the drive,"
stated Miss Kolar yesterday, "is to
collect this money, and to make the
students aware of the need for it."
In conjunction with the drive, the
Daily is including a special Red
Cross rotogravure section with its
Red Cross edition today, illustrating
some of the Red Cross needs, ac
tivities, and functions.
On exhibition in the Bookstore
window this week are newspapers
printed by American and British
prisoners of war in German prison
camps. Included with these are pho
tographs of life in the camps, to
gether with Red Cross activities to
ease the lives of interned fighting
men.
Also in the exhibit are samples of
what the average Stanford student
can do to help the Red Cross and
speed the progress of the war.
Among these are bandage rolling,
motor corps, nurse's aide, donating
blood, helping with Dibble Hospital
entertainment, and knitting. In these
and countless other ways Stanford
students can do their part to insure
the success of the current Red Cross
drive and to help the Red Cross in
its relief work for millions of suffer
ing people everywhere.
