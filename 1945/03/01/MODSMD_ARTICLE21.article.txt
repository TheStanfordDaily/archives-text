# Red Cross Director Works Swing Shift
## 
### PAULA JONES 
If you should see somebody climb
ing the steps of the Hoover Tower
overloaded with Red Cross posters
and flags, the chances are it would
be Mrs. Dare McMullin, the Volun
teer Public Information Chairman of
the Palo Alto chapter of the Red
Cross.
But don't let this fancy title scare
you away. According to Mrs. Mc-
Mullin, it's just a lively variety of
a waste paper job, for she gets
swamped with the odds and ends
that nobody else wants to take care
of. She claims to be the pony-express
for all the forgotten errands. These
include anything from taking re
ceipts into the janitors' mess hall
and clearing away the red tape in
order to string a flag across the
street, to decorating a movie house
and counting the "take" afterwards.
Has Many Duties
This job means that she must
"stick her paws into everybody's
business from the mayor on down,"
and give a helping hand to any Red
Cross department which may be ex
panding or in trouble. One of her
j duties that she always enjoys is that
j of taking visitors interested in the
! Red Cross "around the shop" and
! to the canteen for lunch.
How did she go about getting such
a position? Well, it's as simple as
this! One day she walked unsuspect
ingly into the Red Cross office and
asked, "Is there some little thing I
could do to help?" "Why certainly,"
I they answered, "you can be publicity
j chairman." Then they started her
i off with a wonderful committee of
; 20 people, not one of whom she has
; seen sinceâ€”in that capacity. "They're
j nice people, but we don't have time."
j Gives Speeches
It is her job not only to meet visit

ing speakers, but to give speeches
herself. She admits that everytime
she walks to the front of the plat
form she thinks how easy it would
be to just keep on walking.
After the benefit Red Cross tennis
matches held here last fall, she was
the one who had to give the tourna
ment reports to the San Francisco
papers. That was one time when she
wished she knew a little more about
tennis for she was reporting to sports
editors.
| Works on Night Shift
The thing that scares her most of
, all, however, is writing articles for
The Daily. "You see," says Mrs. Mc-
Mullin, '"I didn't make The Daily
when I tried out as a freshman."
Instead, she went into literature and
became editor of a school literary
magazine.
Since she has the position of Re
search Secretary in the Hoover
Library, her Red Cross work has to
be done on the night shift. But this,
according to Mrs. McMullin. has its
advantages since she doesn't have to
go to all the daytime meetings.
Human Touch Present
She enjoys this kind of war work
and the chance it gives her to see
her old and new Stanford friends.
Besides, there is the ever-present
human touch, even if it's only some
body knee-high coming to give his
piggy bank.
When asked about human interest
stories, Mrs. McMullin said. "There
aren't any from this drive; we
haven't started being human yet. But
I can remember hearing Sam. who
was sent back from the Mediter
ranean to rest, tell about a smooth
old gent he had met in an Army club
over there. 'All of a sudden he got
me talking about the Red Cross, and
it's a darn good thing I only knew
swell things about it. I found out
afterwards it was Basil O'Connor,
Red Cross chairman of the whole
shooting match.' "
Nurse Tolls Story
"I can also remember Beth, that
| Navy nurse taken off Bataan by
l submarine, saying bitterly that she
didn't want to be where everything
was soft and you were safe and had
enough to eat. She wanted to be out
where the boys were fighting."
"Then there was Carol, in a Nissen
hut club in Iceland, so snowbound
that the men who came in for rec
reation had to telephone their camps
that they had made it through the
snow. And little blond Barbara
perched up on the backbone of
China, making life normal and gay
in the leisure hours of the boys who
'fly the hump.' "
Also Works at Dibble
Mrs. McMullin is a very popular
j person at Dibble where she is well-
J known for the way she reads the
soldiers' palms. "But this," she in
sists. "should be classified as fun.
not war work."
Mrs. McMullin suggests that stu
dents wanting to help with the Red
I Cross should register at the War
Board as being on call for any
"quickie" task that might come up.
In the past, students have been called
upon to do anything from decorating
for the Army Thanksgiving dinner
to moving furniture at the Red Cross
office.
