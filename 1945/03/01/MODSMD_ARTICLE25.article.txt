# SO SMALL A WAY
## 
### 
If you haven't noticed already there is probably no sense in
telling you now, but today we are throwing away the policy of
telling Stanford it ought to support the Red Cross and we are
letting the Red Cross speak for itself.
On these pages there is news of the people whom you know.
Many of them are directly dependent on the world-wide respect
given' the Red Cross to gain them communication with their
homes.
Many people have volunteered their time so that we might
have information about people close to Stanford who are work
ing with the Red Cross.
If we merely give a moment's attention to the activities of
this agency we will realize that no Stanford student ought to be
able to refuse the 2 dollars that the campus organization is
asking.
The blood bank, the Red Cross courses, the bandage rolling
room, and other agencies sponsored through the War Board are
available every day and ought to be part of our steady contri
bution to the effective work that they are doing.
The unquestioned relief which they bring to our millions
of soldiers is their first claim upon us; their help for the suffering
of hundreds of thousands of civilians in war-torn countries is
also a claim; and we who are dedicated here to the study of long
range weapons to preserve the dignity of man against a chaotic
v/orld cannot refuse to aid the Red Cross in so small a way.
