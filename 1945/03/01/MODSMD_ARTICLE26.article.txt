Large-scale battles are being fought on both the Eastern and
the Western fronts, and it is now not profitable to consider them
separately. The war is nearing a climax. The Germans might
well survive it, but, if they don't, there is a very good chance
that they will sue for an armistice in the next few days.
The Russian army is at present stopped, and this is the big
opportunity for the enemy. It is true that Rokossovsky is making
progress, and that Zhukov, by lunging out in a new direction,
has broken through in Pomerania. But the battles are still on
the east bank of the Oder, and thus the German line is not
threatened.
The two marshals are advancing toward each other, trying
to form a junction. This column previously mentioned that, if
the Russians were stopped, the enemy could launch a counter
offensive into this space, separating them. The Red Army at
present seems to be trying to eliminate that opportunity.
Silesia Battle
There are reports of sporadic armored engagements which
Zhukov's left wing, down by Silesia, is supposed to be provoking.
They are being fought around the barriers separating him from
Eerlin, but they are too disjointed at present to be very much,
and they are probably diversionary attacks to cover the north
ward extension of his hight.
Previously, the Red Army was content to operate in sepa
rated bodies, giving up security for speed and for keeping the
momentum that they had. Now they are trying the safer tech
nique of first establishing a solidly connected line, which does
riot speak too optimistically of the present situation in the East.
If the Germans did stop the Russians, it is because of three
reasons:
1. Russian supply lines are over-extended.
2. The enemy controls the rail lines joining in Berlin, allow
ing them to shift troops to threatened spots much more quickly
than the Russians can shift reserves.
3. The defensive strength of the Oder River.
West Front
The Russians thus might have to take time to mount more
power for a new offensive, giving the Germans a chance to
repair their Western Line.
As things stand there, the enemy center is pierced. Cologne
is in imminent danger, and we have already started to fan out,
the Ninth Army moving north along the road to Duisberg. The
enemy strength is on the flanks, and, if Von Rundstedt has the
strength and the personality, he might re-establish discipline in
his demoralized army and slow us down by jabbing at our wings.
But his only chance of recouping his fortunes and his line is
by holding onto the Rhine cities. If a few divisions can hold
them, he can yet re-establish his lines, or at worst get across
the Rhine in good order. He is said to have no reserves, so the
loss of momentum of the Russian offensive might supply him
the needed troops â€”from the Eastern Front.
