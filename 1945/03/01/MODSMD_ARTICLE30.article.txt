# SWEET SUMMER BREEZE
## 
### 
The sounds of warm, heartfelt, oh-so-glorious
sighs in the summer sun, reveal that blessed
fact, to all who possess the finer sensibilities,
that the Lake is open.
Like the evils of sin and the slow coils of the
"demon rum" the Lake, too, is annually herald
ed in The Daily for its precarious foils.
We are not going to dwell on your bawl-out
average, that's your business! What we do want
to make guite clear is that no year has gone by
when someone has not drowned at Lagunita
Lake.
The rules posted are lengthy and we don't
know if you read them when we printed them,
but if you will use some sense and a lot of good
old carefulness about swimming and playing
there, you will make the sighs oh-so much more
sincerely glorious.
