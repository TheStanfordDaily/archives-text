### JAN LAMB 
Miss Luell A. Weed, present as
i sistant chairman of Disaster Relief,
American Red Cross, for this vicinity,
says "she has the Red Cross in her
blood by this time." During the past
! year she served as assistant to the
j director of personnel for the Pacific
| Area, A.R.C., on a leave of absence
from her position as assistant pro
fessor of women's physical education
; at Stanford.
Helps Organize First Aid in Paly
Miss Weed first became interested
in Red Cross work, when, after Pearl
| Harbor she was possessed by the de
| sire to do something as her part in
i the war effort.
Although she had already been
granted a leave of absence for win
ter quarter '41-'42 to go skiing at
Sun Valley, this vacation lost its ap-
J peal for her following the declara
tion of war. Accordingly she used
this free time, instead, to assist the
Red Cross in organizing First Aid
classes in Palo Alto. Under the direc
tion of Mrs. Edward Liston, homes,
school buildings, any rooms large
enough to enable 20 people to work
at once, were utilized. Sixty-two
classes were organized and kept go
ing at the same time.
Works on Fire Control
Later she worked on the Red Cross
First Aid Committee for chemical
warfare at Stanford. Civilian defense
chairmen attended classes here and

were taught methods of extinguish
ing chemical fires, and controlling
phosphorous bombs.
Miss Weed also served as volun
teer chairman of Water Safety for
the Palo Alto chapter for two years.
Tours Western States
When Miss Weed was asked to
assume the position in personnel
work for the A.R.C. she went to
Washington, D. C. in September,
1943, for the overseas orientation
course. She spent the next five
months touring the seven Western
states, visiting all colleges and uni
versities as well as Red Cross chap
ters, interviewing ap p 1 icants for
overseas and domestic military wel
fare positions and for chapter posi
tions.
''1 was so busy most of the time ..."
said Miss Weed. She travelled by
bus, train, coach, and upon rare oc
casions by plane, keeping a schedule
of an average of 10 interviews daily
besides making speeches to interested
groups. She held conferences with
chapter executives regarding over
seas and domestic personnel needs.

Tells Unique Incidents
Reminiscing over some of her ex
' periences while in the service of the
J A.R.C.. Miss Weed remarked, "I was
; scheduled once on a freight train . . .
| one ni.uht travelled on an old train
! with a coal stove up in the front of
i the car . . . they came in at midnight
| to shovel coal into the stove . . .
i stranded in Corvallis one night be
| cause the Army came first.''
From February until September of
1944 when she returned to Stanford,
Miss Weed had charge of the per
sonnel unit office in Los Angeles
which covered Southern California
I and Arizona. There she had the
[ pleasure of being one of the hostesses
to Lady John Dill who was touring
I the United States as representative
j oi the British Red Cross.
Opportunities in Red Cross Work
Miss Weed stated that "the Ameri-
I can Red Cross program offers activi
ties for all ages and interests, both
paid and volunteer. Even though the
overseas age requirement is 25 there
are many domestic positions open to
persons over 23 and many volunteer
activities still urgently needing your
cooperation such as volunteer nurse's
aid and the blood donor service. The
| hospital rehabilitation programs are
extending the areas of interest ex-
I tensively."
