# Souvenir Exhibit At Library
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
Over in the Main Library, to the
left of the entrance, is a remarkable
exhibit of Japanese trophies, col
lected by Marine Cpl. Fred W. Saun
ders during 32 months of South Pa
cific action. The exhibit is com
prised of souvenirs from several
major campaigns including Guadal
canal, Peleliu, and Cape Gloucester.
For a while this exhibit was
proudly displayed in the Encina store
by Cpl. Saunders' father, George E.
Black, better known as "Blackie."
Blackie's collection was so inter
esting that it was moved to the li
brary, and here are some highlights
in the battle career of Corporal
Saunders and the stories behind a
few of the trophies.
First at Guadalcanal
Saunders' job was communica
tions, and he used the walkie-talkie,
but whenever his division estab
lished a beachhead, he fought with
his gun right up in the front ranks.
His first action was Guadalcanal,
and he was in the third boatload to
hit the beach.
It was on Guadalcanal that he
picked up a Japanese photograph
album from an officer. He and his
buddy lay under cover for two days
watching the wounded Jap; they
couldn't fire for fear of revealing
their position. Finally the tension
became so great that Saunders
crawled over and stabbed the Jap
to death, taking possession of his
album. Later, while carrying this
same album slung across his back, a
piece of shrapnel tore into it; the
souvenir probably saved his life.
No Serious Injuries
Saunders was lucky throughout
these campaigns, receiving no se
rious injuries. About the worst ac
cident was a shrapnel wound, but
fortunately the metal was just about
spent when it hit him. Also in the
trophies from Guadalcanal are some
metal fragments labeled as parts of
a Jap Zero. Actually, according to
Blackie, these are pieces from the
first enemy bomber shot down over
the island.
Saunders remained on Guadalca
nal until his division was released,
then was taken back to Australia
for a few months. The next move
was to Buna, New Guinea, where
his division entrained for the Cape
Gloucester drive.
Japs Drop Leaflets
By this time the Japanese were
ready for invaders. Caught off guard
before on Guadalcanal, the Japs
knew someone was coming. But
when the Marines landed the Japs
thought they were Aussies and
dropped vile propaganda degrading

the American soldiers. Saunders
brought home a few leaflets, one de
picting a valiant little band of Aus
sies holding back the mighty Jap
machine, with Roosevelt standing off
in the background laughing. Other
leaflets were more degenerate, but
so crude that few normal soldiers
would have been moved by them.
All these South Pacific campaigns
were typified by extreme weather.
The seasons were monotonously the
same, with everything eternally
green, but the most unusual condi
tion was the rain. In one zone that
Saunders fought in, 130 inches fell
in less than a month. The rain
wouldn't have been so bad falling
during a certain season and getting
it over with, but the weather was
erratic. The men would perspire
from a fierce sun, and five minutes
later drip in a pelting rainstorm.
Went to Peleliu
Saunders stayed on Cape Glou
cester for almost five months, and
then returned to the Marine First
Division base. From here the next
island in line for an attack was
Peleliu in the Palau group. The
Japs were entrenched on this out
post too, and according to Saunders
the fighting was worse than Guadal
canal for a short time. On Peleliu
Saunders picked up a few more
souvenirs to round out his collec
tion, including a Jap helmet and a
saber chain. Peleliu was his last
battle, and now Cpl. Saunders is
back home on duty in San Francisco.
