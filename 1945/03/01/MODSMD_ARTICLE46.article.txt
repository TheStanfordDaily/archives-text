# Cellar Closes Early; More Bills Left Unpaid
## 
### 
Because some of the hashers failed
to show up Tuesday night, the Cel
j lar was forced to close at 10 p.m.
Those that were there were unable
to take care of the crowd and had
to work exceptionally late.
The total amount of money lost
to ASSU Monday night because of
unpaid bills was $2.12.
