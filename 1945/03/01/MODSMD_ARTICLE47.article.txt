# Red Cross Worker Writes About China
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
From California to India and China
within 11 months—such is the life of
a recreational worker in the Red
Cross.
Such too is the life of Barbara
Hamilton, sister of Political Science
Secretary Mrs. Fay Jones. Miss
Hamilton, who joined the Red Cross
in January 1944, is now stationed at
the Town Club in Kunming, China,
working with British, French,
American, and Chinese military per
sonnel.
Within 40 miles of Kunming, the
Red Cross maintains a rest camp
with swimming, boating and tennis,
for pilots and enlisted men who are
too exhausted to continue flying or
fighting.
Meets Guerilla General
"Being so far from home, and in
a place so entirely different from
home, the men over here appreciate
the least little thing we can do for
them," writes Miss Hamilton.
When in China, she met a famous
Chinese guerilla general—a former
Stanford man — who remembered
Mrs. Jones from his work in the
poli sci department. He and his wife,
a Mills College graduate, invited
Miss Hamilton to their home for
dinner.
Knows Pons, Kostclanitz
Also on the list overseas acquaint
ances are Lily Pons and husband
Andre Kostclanitz, Major General
Chennault, three residents of Palo
Alto, and former Flying Tigers now
employed in the CNAC, a Chinese
commercial air line.
Americans in China are largely
fliers and soldiers assisting in the
military training of Chinese. In the
area surrounding Miss Hamilton's
Town Club in Kunming, there are
several Army posts, and since the
club is located on the Burma Road
in the route'over the Hump, nearly
everyone going into China passes
through it.
Club Serves Dinner
First floor and a sub-story dining
room of the club, which will be used
ultimately as a hotel, has been taken
over by the Red Cross for the con
venience and enter tainment of
American soldiers—G.l.'s four days
a week, officers three. Open from
11 a.m. to 11 p.m., the club serves
doughnuts and coffee — traditional

Red Cross fare—in the afternoons,
and serves dinner in the early eve
ning.
Colored table-c lot h s, napkins,
floral displays, and dinner music
prepared by the Red Cross girls are
much appreciated by the men who
have been living in tents, Mrs. Jones
said.
Five American Red Cross girls and
five Chinese women live at the club;
among those on the staff are Chinese
cooks who have been taught to pre
pare American dishes by American
dieticians. Program director of the
club was formerly a New York
radio director.
Assigned to India Temporarily
Only temporarily assigned to India,
she served with the Clubmobile
there, taking food and entertainment
to distant outposts in Red Cross
trucks.
Missionaries in China have enter
tained the Red Cross women gen
erously; and the son of the governor
of the province where Miss Hamilton
is stationed has invited them to visit
the family's many gorgeous estates—
some Chinese, some distinctly West
ern in style. He plans to attend
Harvard after the war.
Prices High in China
The trip by ship to India resembled
a pre-war vacation cruise, judging
from the accommodations enjoyed
by Miss Hamilton. On the decks re
served for the Red Cross and Army
officers, she was instructed in Chi
nese, identification of planes, and
art lettering.
Prices in China, she reported, are
very high, since all supplies are
flown in by air. The post exchanges
are not as well stocked as those in
India; consequently she welcomes
the lipstick, powder puffs and bobby
pins Mrs. Jones encloses in her let
ters.
Trains Late There, Too
In India, Miss Hamilton was fas
cinated by the Indian trains—the
engineers stopped frequently for a
bite to eat or took their families
along for a ride, rarely got to the
destination in less than three times
the necessary hours.
Lavish country clubs, with golf
courses, tennis courts, and swimming
pools surrounded by orchids, were
the fare in India, where Miss Hamil
ton was entertained by English and
Indian residents.

to distant outposts in Red Cross
trucks.
Missionaries in China have enter
tained the Red Cross women gen
erously; and the son of the governor
of the province where Miss Hamilton
is stationed has invited them to visit
the family's many gorgeous estates—
some Chinese, some distinctly West
ern in style. He plans to attend
Harvard after the war.
Prices High in China
The trip by ship to India resembled
a pre-war vacation cruise, judging
from the accommodations enjoyed
by Miss Hamilton. On the decks re
served for the Red Cross and Army
officers, she was instructed in Chi
nese, identification of planes, and
art lettering.
Prices in China, she reported, are
very high, since all supplies are
flown in by air. The post exchanges
are not as well stocked as those in
India; consequently she welcomes
the lipstick, powder puffs and bobby
pins Mrs. Jones encloses in her let
ters.
Trains Late There, Too
In India, Miss Hamilton was fas
cinated by the Indian trains—the
engineers stopped frequently for a
bite to eat or took their families
along for a ride, rarely got to the
destination in less than three times
the necessary hours.
Lavish country clubs, with golf
courses, tennis courts, and swimming
pools surrounded by orchids, were
the fare in India, where Miss Hamil
ton was entertained by English and
Indian residents.
From California to India and China
within 11 months—such is the life of
a recreational worker in the Red
Cross.
Such too is the life of Barbara
Hamilton, sister of Political Science
Secretary Mrs. Fay Jones. Miss
Hamilton, who joined the Red Cross
in January 1944, is now stationed at
the Town Club in Kunming, China,
working with British, French,
American, and Chinese military per
sonnel.
Within 40 miles of Kunming, the
Red Cross maintains a rest camp
with swimming, boating and tennis,
for pilots and enlisted men who are
too exhausted to continue flying or
fighting.
Meets Guerilla General
"Being so far from home, and in
a place so entirely different from
home, the men over here appreciate
the least little thing we can do for
them," writes Miss Hamilton.
When in China, she met a famous
Chinese guerilla general—a former
Stanford man — who remembered
Mrs. Jones from his work in the
poli sci department. He and his wife,
a Mills College graduate, invited
Miss Hamilton to their home for
dinner.

Also on the list overseas acquaint
ances are Lily Pons and husband
Andre Kostclanitz, Major General
Chennault, three residents of Palo
Alto, and former Flying Tigers now
employed in the CNAC, a Chinese
commercial air line.
Americans in China are largely
fliers and soldiers assisting in the
military training of Chinese. In the
area surrounding Miss Hamilton's
Town Club in Kunming, there are
several Army posts, and since the
club is located on the Burma Road
in the route'over the Hump, nearly
everyone going into China passes
through it.
Club Serves Dinner
First floor and a sub-story dining
room of the club, which will be used
ultimately as a hotel, has been taken
over by the Red Cross for the con
venience and enter tainment of
American soldiers—G.l.'s four days
a week, officers three. Open from
11 a.m. to 11 p.m., the club serves
doughnuts and coffee — traditional

Red Cross fare—in the afternoons,
and serves dinner in the early eve
ning.
Colored table-c lot h s, napkins,
floral displays, and dinner music
prepared by the Red Cross girls are
much appreciated by the men who
have been living in tents, Mrs. Jones
said.
Five American Red Cross girls and
five Chinese women live at the club;
among those on the staff are Chinese
cooks who have been taught to pre
pare American dishes by American
dieticians. Program director of the
club was formerly a New York
radio director.
