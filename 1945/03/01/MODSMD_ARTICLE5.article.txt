# Red Cross Sends Aid To Prisoners of War
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
American prisoner of war attitude
toward Red Cross activities was ex
hibited recently in a letter from
Capt. Barney McClure, '42, to his
mother, Mrs. L. A. McClure of Los
Gatos, when he wrote, "I don't know
what we'd do without the Red
Cross."
A prisoner of war in Germany
since June of 1944, McClure was at
Stalag Luft 111 in Silesia until the
latest Russian campaign, according
to his sister, Marylou McClure,
when he was moved. "We don't

know where he is now," added Miss
McClure.
Food, Medicine, Clothes Sent
In infrequent letters home, Mc-
Clure has given high praise to the
Red Cross prisoner of war service
which sends weekly food parcels to
interned servicemen, as well as
medicine, clothingâ€”and seeds and
cookbooks. Most prison camps allow
men to cultivate flower and vege
table gardens to help with the food
supply. This produce the men raise,
harvest, and cook themselves. "The
boys themselves do all their own
cooking on wood stoves," wrote Mc-
Clure. "The treatment in prison
camp isn't bad; we're left pretty
much on our own," read the letter.
"The food isn't bad, but that is
thanks only to the Red Cross
weekly food parcels." he contin
ued, adding, "We save enough in
gredients to make a cake once in
a while."
Edited Chappie in '42
McClure, who graduated from
Stanford in 1942, was editor of the
Chaparral in that year, and presi
dent of his fraternity, Theta Delta
Chi. A member of R.0.T.C., he re
ceived his commission on graduating,
and worked in Air Corps adminis
tration for a while. He transferred
to pilot training in spring of 19415,
receiving his wings in February 1944.
Sent overseas in May, he was sta
tioned in Italy until his B-24 bomb
er was shot down "deep in the
heart of Germany" (according to
his first letter to his family after his
capture) early in June of last year.
He is married to the former Nancy
Porter of Greencastle, Ind.; his sis
ter. Marylou McClure. is vice-presi
dent of the Associated Students and
is a junior at Stanford.
