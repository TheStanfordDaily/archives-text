# Students To Meet Faculty Tonight
## 
### 
Would you like to meet Dr. and
Mrs. Bayard Morgan? Or Dr. and
Mrs. Philip Buck? Or Miss Hazel
D. Hanson, classics professor?
An informal get-together will be
held at Miss Pat's house, 541 Salva
tierra, from 7 to 7:45 tonight for
the benefit of students en route to
the Libe, or those interested in dis
cussing amateur dramatics at Stan
ford with these professors.
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, in his
speech before the Tradition Day As
sembly, spoke of the custom at Stan
ford of meeting professors informally
outside of the classroom, and advised
students to take advantage of every
opportunity to meet the fine men
who are members of Stanford's
faculty. For this reason, the "Y" is
sponsoring tonight's meeting.
A topic for discussion has been
arbitrarily named, but the meeting
will be primarily for the purpose of
becoming acquainted with one an
other. Coffee and mints will be
served, according to Chairman Cathy
Hauser.
