# Hilltoppers Edge Out Gerona In Wild, High Scoring Tussle
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
In a game that saw a bucket made
almost every time the two teams
rated down the floor, a sizzling Tyler
quintet downed Gerona by a score
of 44-22. Defense seemed to be a
thing of the past to these two squads,
who played through the entire game
without a time-out or a foul being
called.
Tyler took an early lead of six
points only to lose it again to the
Gerona boys, and the half ended
with the count knotted at 22 all.
In the second half the flashily clad
"Hilltoppers" fought with grim de
termination and managed to get an
other six point lead only to almost
drop the contest in the closing mo
ments when Reische and Rosburg
of Gerona A.C. dropped in successive
shots.
High point honors for the evening
were shared by Dennis Fox of Tyler
and Dave Grey of Gerona with 14
digits each. Fox was hot the first
half and sunk some beautiful long
shots fnfm the left side, whereas
Grey did exceptionally well on the
backboards and made some difficult
tip-ins. Al McDowell and John
Glathc, also, did some good work for
the Tylerites and contributed 10 and
12 points respectively.

This win was the first for Tyler
since their pre-season triumph over
the Betas. Both teams were handi
capped by the fact that they only
had five players each.
In the only 8:15 game the Cubs
dropped the Chinese Club from the ;
unbeaten ranks by a score of 16-11. j
This win for the Cults {jives them a
tie for firs! place in the Lagunila
League with the Legal Eagle squad. '■
The Chinese Club, which is usually
in there fighting, had an off night
tonight, and some nice shots by
Randolph of the victors succeeded
in edging them out. YVu topped the
losers with six points to his credit.
If Tyler can top the Cubs tomorrow
night, they will practically cinch the
title for the Lawyer's quintet.
Because of a misunderstanding of
the game time the Legal Eagle-Griz
zlie game and the Med. 11-Arguello
White game have been postponed
until next Monday.
