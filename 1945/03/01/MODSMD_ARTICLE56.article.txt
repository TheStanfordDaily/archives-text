# Legal Eagles To Vie With Arguello Whites
## 
### MORT COHEN 
With the intra-mural coming just
about to an end, and with three un
defeated teams still cavorting around
in the Lagunita League, it looks as
though someone will have to get
beaten or the league will end up in
a draw. And tonight will probably
not help matters along, for all three
; teams should continue on the victory
I road.
I The Cubs, one of the fastest and
; most spectacular squads in either
league, should be able to down Tyler,
| even though they will probably have
j a tough time doing it. Since Tom
j Eagen left, the Tyler boys have met
i with never-flinching trouble and are
| still looking for the light of victory
: to guide them through the season.
i However, they are still good, and
when hot, could dump anybody.
The Legal Eagles should have little
trouble, if any at all, in pulverizing
the Art»uello Whites. So far this sea
son, the Whites have not clicked and
do not show much hope for changing
their ways. On the other hand, the
Lawyers, with Husby, Hartwell, and
Kellar, look better in every per
formance.
Chinese Club, the other top squad,
| faces the Strangers in the Pavilion
1 and should walk out of the Pavilion

with the same percentage as they
entered. In the only other game of
the evening, Gerona battles the Griz
zlies. Gerona, with Parker Reichie
leading the attack, rates as definite
j favorites. The game will be close,
j though.

Tyler vs. Cubs 7:15
