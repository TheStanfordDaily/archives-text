# THE 						PRICE OF HONOR
## 
### 
At the end of the Excom story yesterday morning was a
paragraph which merely said "recommendation that examinations
not be taken from the classrooms . . . was made by the Honor
Code committee ... in the interests of maintaining the high ideals
and traditions of the Code."
The piece of reasoning introduced as excusing this definite
infringement upon the Honor Code as it is now interpreted by
every student, whether or not he ever takes exams from the
room, and the way it is introduced to every freshmen entering
the University is to our mind fallacious and deceitful.
The reason is said to be that taking the examination from the
room does not place group responsibility for enforcement of
the Honor Code. This is true. It doesn't. It still places responsi
bility for the Honor Code where it belongs: with every individual
Stanford student to conduct himself with honor.
Some of the supplementary reasons are no doubt that if every
one left the room tests would be chaotic; that is nonsense. Any
student now feels that he can take the test where he wants to if
he wants to; but only a small percentage of students in any test
do so.
The right to take out the test if a student wants to should be
preserved as the very essence of faith in the Honor Code as it
applies to academic work.
Other reasons are such things as an unegual advantage which
some people may have by moving their exams to a more favor
able losation. But those are likely to be the people who are more
than ordinarily handicapped by staying in the test room. The
insignificance of these reasons is pitiful.
Is there anyone who can sincerely believe that the individual
responsibility, in one of its most popular concrete actions, should
be sacked for the sake' of having a third person responsibility?
Only a week ago at the alumni conference, Dr. Tresidder
spoke with pride of the ability of Stanford students "to take their
exams out under an oak tree"; this is the way we have all come
to look with trust upon our fellow students.
Dr. Jordan, in setting up the fundamental standard from which
our Honor Code springs, said, 'students are expected to show . . .
respect for order, morality, and personal honor." The emphasis
should remain on "personal" honor.
A Stanford graduate is said to have adopted the Honor Code
as a way of democratic living: Therefore it is important that vio
lations be grounds for expulsion.
There is, however, a negligible percentage of Stanford stu
dents who are not willing to live by the Honor Code. Perhaps the
price of a few cheap passing grades may have to be paid so that

the vast majority of Stanford students may feel that the Honor
Code is an acheivement of a superior way of democratic living.
We cannot help but believe, and refuse, to consider the Honor
Code as a living thing, if every student does not want it to be a
personal responsibility, in which the privilege of taking exams
wherever we want, makes it more than a lot of verbiage.

to look with trust upon our fellow students.
Dr. Jordan, in setting up the fundamental standard from which
our Honor Code springs, said, 'students are expected to show . . .
respect for order, morality, and personal honor." The emphasis
should remain on "personal" honor.
A Stanford graduate is said to have adopted the Honor Code
as a way of democratic living: Therefore it is important that vio
lations be grounds for expulsion.
There is, however, a negligible percentage of Stanford stu
dents who are not willing to live by the Honor Code. Perhaps the
price of a few cheap passing grades may have to be paid so that

the vast majority of Stanford students may feel that the Honor
Code is an acheivement of a superior way of democratic living.
We cannot help but believe, and refuse, to consider the Honor
Code as a living thing, if every student does not want it to be a
personal responsibility, in which the privilege of taking exams
wherever we want, makes it more than a lot of verbiage.
At the end of the Excom story yesterday morning was a
paragraph which merely said "recommendation that examinations
not be taken from the classrooms . . . was made by the Honor
Code committee ... in the interests of maintaining the high ideals
and traditions of the Code."
The piece of reasoning introduced as excusing this definite
infringement upon the Honor Code as it is now interpreted by
every student, whether or not he ever takes exams from the
room, and the way it is introduced to every freshmen entering
the University is to our mind fallacious and deceitful.
The reason is said to be that taking the examination from the
room does not place group responsibility for enforcement of
the Honor Code. This is true. It doesn't. It still places responsi
bility for the Honor Code where it belongs: with every individual
Stanford student to conduct himself with honor.
Some of the supplementary reasons are no doubt that if every
one left the room tests would be chaotic; that is nonsense. Any
student now feels that he can take the test where he wants to if
he wants to; but only a small percentage of students in any test
do so.
The right to take out the test if a student wants to should be
preserved as the very essence of faith in the Honor Code as it
applies to academic work.
Other reasons are such things as an unegual advantage which
some people may have by moving their exams to a more favor
able losation. But those are likely to be the people who are more
than ordinarily handicapped by staying in the test room. The
insignificance of these reasons is pitiful.
Is there anyone who can sincerely believe that the individual
responsibility, in one of its most popular concrete actions, should
be sacked for the sake' of having a third person responsibility?
Only a week ago at the alumni conference, Dr. Tresidder
spoke with pride of the ability of Stanford students "to take their
exams out under an oak tree"; this is the way we have all come
to look with trust upon our fellow students.
