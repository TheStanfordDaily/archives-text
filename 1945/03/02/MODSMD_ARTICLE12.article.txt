# Seen from an Ivory Tower

### Walrus the CarQenter 
Deur Mr. WALRUS:
Pray what is the reason for all
the fuss you have been making
recently in your column about John
Bell and Dr. Johnson? Quriosity led
me to read something by Dr. John
son after hearing so much from you
about him, but my course of read
ing in that worthy author has more
perplexed my understanding than
gratified it.
In the first place I can see no
resemblance between what you are
pleased to call your "style" and that
of Dr. Johnson and am inclined to
think it presumption to claim what
cannot be generally observed and
insolence to defend what the world
regards as beyond censure.
Your chief function, my dear Sir,
is to furnish entertainment, as much
instruction as you are capable of
supplying and at least that morality
by precept that you cannot inculcate
by example.
You have, however, drawn no
grand scheme of life either for
amusement or edification. The petty
vanities of authors, the spurious in
dignation excited by factions and
the transient sympathies of senti
mentality are the tare that you now
provide. Your dwindling audience
wryly remember the promise of your
introduction, in which majestic
sonority in some measure atoned for
vagueness concerning specific under
takings.
"... I shall do such things, What

they are yet I know not, but they
shall be The wonder of the world."
Your promises have proved but
empty words. The Memoirs of John
Bell, sanguine as you are, cannot be
expected to shake the earth. What
little of it I have been able to endure
arouses no feeling of interest and I
remain serenely indifferent to the
question of the authenticity of those
writings whose very existence or
non-existence is itself of no moment.
The present quarter draws to its
clo.se. Forbear from the follies of
the past and begin the coming new
quarter free'd from the encumber
ance of their example. I pray you,
my dear Sir, to forego any further
extracts from those verbose memoirs,
spare us your disingenuous specula
tions on their authorship and let us
have done with Dr. Johnson.
Instead, for the spring quarter,
leave your Ivory Tower and give us
your observations from the Life
Guard Tower; make us party to your
descriptions of social life at the
Boathouse; take your nose out of
Dr. Johnson's books and stick it
into some business of the present
time. By these means you will not
only secure the renewed attention
of your readers but will render your
self immune from the receipt of such
letters as this present one from, my
Dear Sir,
Your humble, obedient servant,
Robert Jackson-Hildreth,
c/o The Boathouse.

Dear Sir,
Your humble, obedient servant,
Robert Jackson-Hildreth,
c/o The Boathouse.
Deur Mr. WALRUS:
Pray what is the reason for all
the fuss you have been making
recently in your column about John
Bell and Dr. Johnson? Quriosity led
me to read something by Dr. John
son after hearing so much from you
about him, but my course of read
ing in that worthy author has more
perplexed my understanding than
gratified it.
In the first place I can see no
resemblance between what you are
pleased to call your "style" and that
of Dr. Johnson and am inclined to
think it presumption to claim what
cannot be generally observed and
insolence to defend what the world
regards as beyond censure.
Your chief function, my dear Sir,
is to furnish entertainment, as much
instruction as you are capable of
supplying and at least that morality
by precept that you cannot inculcate
by example.
You have, however, drawn no
grand scheme of life either for
amusement or edification. The petty
vanities of authors, the spurious in
dignation excited by factions and
the transient sympathies of senti
mentality are the tare that you now
provide. Your dwindling audience
wryly remember the promise of your
introduction, in which majestic
sonority in some measure atoned for
vagueness concerning specific under
takings.
"... I shall do such things, What

they are yet I know not, but they
shall be The wonder of the world."
Your promises have proved but
empty words. The Memoirs of John
Bell, sanguine as you are, cannot be
expected to shake the earth. What
little of it I have been able to endure
arouses no feeling of interest and I
remain serenely indifferent to the
question of the authenticity of those
writings whose very existence or
non-existence is itself of no moment.
The present quarter draws to its
clo.se. Forbear from the follies of
the past and begin the coming new
quarter free'd from the encumber
ance of their example. I pray you,
my dear Sir, to forego any further
extracts from those verbose memoirs,
spare us your disingenuous specula
tions on their authorship and let us
have done with Dr. Johnson.
Instead, for the spring quarter,
leave your Ivory Tower and give us
your observations from the Life
Guard Tower; make us party to your
descriptions of social life at the
Boathouse; take your nose out of
Dr. Johnson's books and stick it
into some business of the present
time. By these means you will not
only secure the renewed attention
of your readers but will render your
self immune from the receipt of such
letters as this present one from, my
