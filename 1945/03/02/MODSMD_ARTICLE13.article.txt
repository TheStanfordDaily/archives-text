# Symposium Hears Barker Address
## 
### 
The economic and social outlook
of progress and expansion which has
marked California during all of its
history was in the 1850's the back
ground, and San Francisco the test
ing ground, for the social reforms
of Henry George. On this theme,
Mr. Charles A. Barker, associate pro
fessor of history, yesterday spoke to
the American Studies Symposium
audience on "Henry George—Demo
cratic Thinker of California."
Dividing attitudes toward Henry
George into three groups—scholarly,
ridiculing, and "disremembering"—
Mr. Barker pointed out his con
nections with other social reformers
of his day and his influence on later
thinking. Mr. Barker mentioned that
George's single-tax plan, proposed
in "Progress and Poverty," was de
bated for many years in San Fran

cisco. The plan provided for the
payment to the public of all income
from land—that is public ownership
of land.
Because of George's method of
expressing his ideas, his preoccupa
tion with the proletariat and his
conformation to democratic ways of
thinking, Mr. Barker concluded by
placing him in line with other demo
cratic thinkers beginning with Thom
as Jefferson.
