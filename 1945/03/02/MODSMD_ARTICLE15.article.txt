# Hurwitz Asks Stanford ‘How About New Ideas?’
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Editorial note: In our series of in
terviews with officers and student
leaders about Stanford's post-war
future. Miss Carol Hurwitz chose to
concentrate on the present day con
flicts and problems which are shap
ing that future.

"Stanford students are notorious
for griping in bull sessions, but never
bringing useful suggestions to Ex
com," said Carol Hurwitz, former
War Board Coordinator, member of
Cardinals, and president of Madrono.
'"They have plenty of ideas, but
don't put them to use."
We are upset aboiJt the housing
situation and unrepresentative stu
dent government, but we mumble
our criticisms and suggestions into
a cup of Cellar coffee. We don't take
them to the committees who are
working on those very problems. We
wish loudly for the good old days
but do nothing to improve what we
have.
Wanted: Student Opinion
Right now a group is rewriting the
complex Stanford constitution in
clear .simple terms that every student
can understand. One of their biggest
problems is giving the students more
direct representation on Excom, pos
sibly by living groups instead of by
class. Student suggestions are more
than welcome.
Excom is considering the nomina
tion system that so many students
have complained about. They want to
make it more representative of the
student body, by either abolishing
or changing the Nomination Com
mittee. What is your opinion?
"Do something with your gripes,"
Miss Hurwitz urged. "Bring your
ideas to committee meetings and
Excom; write them to Campus Opin
ion. If you don't understand present
plans, go to meetings and find out
about them. Ask your representa
tives. The possibilities are limitless."
What's Wrong
Miss Hurwitz held several other
criticisms of the present attitude
here at Stanford. For one thing, we
think too little of national and in
ternational problems and plans. We
don't seem to realize how much they
will affect our future.
Some of us run for student offices
with the wrong attitude, because of
the glory rather than the desire to
serve. Student officers are apt to
do only their specific duties, and no
more. They do not keep in close con
tact with the students they are rep
resenting.
Change Inevitable
"We seem to forget that war brings
inevitable changes, and that our little
disturbances cannot compare to the
sufferings of our men overseas," said

Miss Hurwitz. She emphasized that
we must accept these changes as !
natural, and not worry needlessly
about Stanford returning to normal
with the rest of the country. There ]
will be many practical problems to
consider in returning to the former
ratio and age standards, and we must
begin now to plan how best to do
it. But there is no doubt that Stan
ford will return to the way we like j
to think of it, with football games 1
and many other outlets for school i
spirit.
Golden Opportunities
In the meantime we can and should
make the most of Stanford's present i
opportunities. Very few colleges have
such varied one. Where else do
faculty and students have such great
opportunity to meet outside of class? i
For instance many houses have in
vited Dr. Popper and Dr. Wheel- !
wright to lead after dinner Com
munity Singing and have enjoyed
it tremendously. Student, faculty
parties have played a large part in
our social program.
Intra-mural sports have been
grand for both men and women.
Different living groups have met
each other under the best conditions
of sportsmanship and enthusiasm.
Our campus itself offers unusual
opportunity for long hikes and bi
cycle rides and picnics, and innum
erable other openings for fun.
Enthusiasm
"Many Stanfordites have utilized
these chances to the utmost and have
thrown themselves wholeheartedly
into work and play," said Miss Hur
witz. Irrepressible groups grabbed
the chance to enter the Pow-Wow
and are making the most of its en
tertainment possibilities.
Many of the girls have been hav
ing a wonderful time entertaining
soldiers from Dibble Hospital, both
on campus and at the hospital itself.
Whatever changes may come to
Stanford in the future, there are
some things Miss Hurwitz hoped
would never change . . . the privilege
of living under the Honor Code and
student government . . . tlie pride of
belonging to Stanford.

here at Stanford. For one thing, we
think too little of national and in
ternational problems and plans. We
don't seem to realize how much they
will affect our future.
Some of us run for student offices
with the wrong attitude, because of
the glory rather than the desire to
serve. Student officers are apt to
do only their specific duties, and no
more. They do not keep in close con
tact with the students they are rep
resenting.
Change Inevitable
"We seem to forget that war brings
inevitable changes, and that our little
disturbances cannot compare to the
sufferings of our men overseas," said

Miss Hurwitz. She emphasized that
we must accept these changes as !
natural, and not worry needlessly
about Stanford returning to normal
with the rest of the country. There ]
will be many practical problems to
consider in returning to the former
ratio and age standards, and we must
begin now to plan how best to do
it. But there is no doubt that Stan
ford will return to the way we like j
to think of it, with football games 1
and many other outlets for school i
spirit.
Golden Opportunities
In the meantime we can and should
make the most of Stanford's present i
opportunities. Very few colleges have
such varied one. Where else do
faculty and students have such great
opportunity to meet outside of class? i
For instance many houses have in
vited Dr. Popper and Dr. Wheel- !
wright to lead after dinner Com
munity Singing and have enjoyed
it tremendously. Student, faculty
parties have played a large part in
our social program.
Intra-mural sports have been
grand for both men and women.
Different living groups have met
each other under the best conditions
of sportsmanship and enthusiasm.
Our campus itself offers unusual
opportunity for long hikes and bi
cycle rides and picnics, and innum
erable other openings for fun.
Enthusiasm
"Many Stanfordites have utilized
these chances to the utmost and have
thrown themselves wholeheartedly
into work and play," said Miss Hur
witz. Irrepressible groups grabbed
the chance to enter the Pow-Wow
and are making the most of its en
tertainment possibilities.
Many of the girls have been hav
ing a wonderful time entertaining
soldiers from Dibble Hospital, both
on campus and at the hospital itself.
Whatever changes may come to
Stanford in the future, there are
some things Miss Hurwitz hoped
would never change . . . the privilege
of living under the Honor Code and
student government . . . tlie pride of
belonging to Stanford.
Editorial note: In our series of in
terviews with officers and student
leaders about Stanford's post-war
future. Miss Carol Hurwitz chose to
concentrate on the present day con
flicts and problems which are shap
ing that future.

"Stanford students are notorious
for griping in bull sessions, but never
bringing useful suggestions to Ex
com," said Carol Hurwitz, former
War Board Coordinator, member of
Cardinals, and president of Madrono.
'"They have plenty of ideas, but
don't put them to use."
We are upset aboiJt the housing
situation and unrepresentative stu
dent government, but we mumble
our criticisms and suggestions into
a cup of Cellar coffee. We don't take
them to the committees who are
working on those very problems. We
wish loudly for the good old days
but do nothing to improve what we
have.
Wanted: Student Opinion
Right now a group is rewriting the
complex Stanford constitution in
clear .simple terms that every student
can understand. One of their biggest
problems is giving the students more
direct representation on Excom, pos
sibly by living groups instead of by
class. Student suggestions are more
than welcome.
Excom is considering the nomina
tion system that so many students
have complained about. They want to
make it more representative of the
student body, by either abolishing
or changing the Nomination Com
mittee. What is your opinion?
"Do something with your gripes,"
Miss Hurwitz urged. "Bring your
ideas to committee meetings and
Excom; write them to Campus Opin
ion. If you don't understand present
plans, go to meetings and find out
about them. Ask your representa
tives. The possibilities are limitless."

erable other openings for fun.
Enthusiasm
"Many Stanfordites have utilized
these chances to the utmost and have
thrown themselves wholeheartedly
into work and play," said Miss Hur
witz. Irrepressible groups grabbed
the chance to enter the Pow-Wow
and are making the most of its en
tertainment possibilities.
Many of the girls have been hav
ing a wonderful time entertaining
soldiers from Dibble Hospital, both
on campus and at the hospital itself.
Whatever changes may come to
Stanford in the future, there are
some things Miss Hurwitz hoped
would never change . . . the privilege
of living under the Honor Code and
student government . . . tlie pride of
belonging to Stanford.
