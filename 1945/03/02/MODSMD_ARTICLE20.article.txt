# Fun-Time Togs Favor Comfort
## 
### CONNIE McGILLICUDDY 
So it's fun you're going to be hav
ing—on a picnic somewhere out on
the hills with a gay group —on a
week-end at Carmel—at the boat
house with the bridge fiends, the
suntan addicts, the canoe paddlers,
the swimmers—or horseback rid
ing on nearby trails—or in a brisk
game of tennis (energctic, aren't
you?).
Stanford women have certain loves
such as the V-necked sweater in
blues, greens, and tan with push-up
sleeves. For most sport occasions
they prefer the inevitable jeans,
rolled up for comfort, with a variety
of bold plaid shirts. With them
they wear "shank's mares,'' mocca
sins, and saddle shoes.
Shorts Arc Long
Why not try the new long shorts
instead of rolled-up jeans? Smart,
practical, these new long shorts are
good for tennis, lounging, are espe
cially attractive in gray flannel.
For tennis there is the short
sharkskin tennis dress. For tennis
or golf there is the white tennis
sweater, the V-neck trimmed in Car
dinal red. For fun on the fairways,
combine it with a cardinal red skirt,
white shoes.
California Sunshine
Sun lovers are getting out the
suntan oil and exposing themselves
regularly, trying to achieve that
toast color before the next gal. And
they'll also be trying the interesting
new styles in swim suits.
Designers this year have ran
sacked fashion sources and have
brought forth a sarong suit — with
variations. Take your choice be
tween a one or two-piece swim
suit.
Holdover
An interesting holdover from last
year is the backless cotton dress
with jacket. You can be perfectly
dressed with the jacket. But re
move it and you're ready to start
the suntan.
It's an interesting season when
shorts are long and coats are short.
Both fashions are delightfully prac
tical, wear well.
