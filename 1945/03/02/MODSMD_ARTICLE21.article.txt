# Baggy Sweaters, Tops Reveal Ingenuity of Stanford Coeds
## 
### 
Despite articles and advertise
ments in fashion magazines that
girlj in the United States are be
ginning to wear more fitted clothes
—tailored dresses and jerkins—on
campuses, sweaters and skirts still
remain on top in colleges through
out the country.
On the Stanford Quad at all times
of day girls in all types and colors
of sweaters and skirts may be seen.
Skirts are either plain, plaid, or
checked. Popular sweaters are either
baggy V-necks, preferably boys"
sweaters, cardigans or slip-overs, or
cashmeres—cardigan, long-sleeve or
short-sleeve slip-overs.
Vary the V-Neck
The baggy, V-neck sweaters can
be worn over V-neck dickies or
blouses, or round - neck, pleated
blouses. Many girls also wear them
over gabardine sport dresses.
Cardigans look well left unbut
toned with a blouse worn under
neath or buttoned up at the '-neck
with a string of pearls or a locket
or a round-neck dicky. Slipovers
can be worn with a necklace or lock
et or a round-neck dicky. Slipovers
can be worn with a necklace or
locket, or over a dicky or blouse of
some kind—either square neck or
the round neck, Peter Pan type.
Quad Coats
On cold mornings Stanford women
usually wear some type of sport coat
to classes. The most popular are
camel's hair, tweed, gabardine, or
trench coats. On rainy days girls are
seen in rain coats of all kinds and
colors—red, blue, green and beige.

The coats are either fitted or of the
box style. They also wear rubber
boots and rain hats of all styles
even fishermen's hats in some cases.
Since spring is on the way, suits
and blazers are becoming increas
ingly popular. Blazers look well with
either plain or plaid skirts, and the
most popular suits are plain colors,
plaids of all colors, and dark blue
and brown checks. Blouses or sweat
ers are usually worn under them.
Walking on Quad
Loafers, saddle shoes, oxfords, and
wooden .shoes are the most popular
for Quad wear, and the most com
fortable too.
A few girls are already beginning
to wear cotton dresses on some of
the warmest days. It won't be lone,
however, before sweaters and skirts
will be discarded and every girl will
drag out her cottons from last year
for everyday wear. This year as
before, dresses will be bright and
cool-looking. U-shaped necks and
very short sleeves are popular as
well as seersucker sport dresses,
flowered chintz, and bright ging
hams.

cashmeres—cardigan, long-sleeve or
short-sleeve slip-overs.

be worn over V-neck dickies or
blouses, or round - neck, pleated
blouses. Many girls also wear them
over gabardine sport dresses.

or a round-neck dicky. Slipovers

Since spring is on the way, suits
and blazers are becoming increas

Walking on Quad

however, before sweaters and skirts
will be discarded and every girl will
drag out her cottons from last year
for everyday wear. This year as
before, dresses will be bright and
cool-looking. U-shaped necks and
very short sleeves are popular as
well as seersucker sport dresses,
flowered chintz, and bright ging
