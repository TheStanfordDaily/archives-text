# Lake Fashions? No Such Anima
## 
### 
"Fashion at the boathouse? There
j ain't no such animal!"
Stanfordites wear any and every-
I thing at the campus Palm Springs.
J We've seen peasant skirts, and jeans,
| and plaid shirts, and faded bathing
suits, and baggy bathing suits, and
"arf" bathing suits! There are even
the eternal skirts and sweaters on
those people who are too busy but
just come up to torture themselves
for a minute before getting back to
"ye old grind."
The shorts with bra tops really
have the edge on the other types of
apparel, though. One reason may
be that while allowing the wearer to
absorb the ultra-violet, they foil any
plans for dunking in the H O. And
that lake is cold!
Hawaiian Influence
We've seen some good-looking Ha
waiian print combinations in cotton
I shantung . . . also some "veddy
J 3harp" gingham checks.
Mrs. Lidster's square - dancing
classes turn up in their dirndl skirts
and sheer white blouses, looking
very cool and terrifically Bohemian,
i Some of the best-looking blouses
have almost drop-shouldered neck
lines, with wide rows of ruffles for
sleeves, and are about as good as

bathing suits for getting suntans.
Melting the Ice
Those hardy souls who turn up
even when the icicles are forming on
the eaves of the boathouse usually
wear their old knee-length plaid
shirts, and jeans (we think). Stan
ford jackets serve a multiplicity of
uses too, as blankets, pillows, wind
breaks, andâ€”jackets.
T shirts come in for their share
of attention, both on the fair sex
and those others. The gals usually
choose theirs with care, matching
'em up to shorts or suits, while the
fellows appear in whatever they
happen to be wearing under those
red jackets.
