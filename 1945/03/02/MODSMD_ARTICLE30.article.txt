# Uds and Downs â€” Skirts Mark Fashion History

### 
After days of extensive research
we've discovered that there's nothing
stable about Stanford fashions . . .
they've run the ramparts through the
yeais of rustJe-your-bustle 1891 up
j to 11145.
But as for the kind of clothes . . .
| you've got us there. In 1905 Stanford
j women had to watch their step as
they walked the Quad clad in flow
| ing. floor-length gowns, fitted to a
] low, pointed waistline and flouncing
out in one flare of glory 10 inches
or so from the hallowed precincts of
the Law Steps. It was the age of
the Gibson Girl, that frail, yet domi
neering type of womanhood. She
didn't know then that sooner or
later she'd be antique and ;i period
piece : 'or the archives.
| Cute Kid
| Callously, we look at her now and
note a vague resemblance to a pouter
pigeon. To balance the sensationalism
of her gown, the Gibson-Girl-at-
Stanford was entreated by adver
tisers in The Daily Palo Alto (great
grandmaw of the Stanford Daily) to
buy large, ilower-strewn hats. With
cabbage-roses overflowing the basic
coal-shovel shape of (he hat, Miss
{ Stanford, ILOS wasn't a babe to be
i trifled with. Styles in hatpins were
long and sharp, and she wits a far
cry Irom a I/il Injun Squaw of 1945.
They Loved 'Em Then
Ten years later . . . came 1915,
i and the years while America sang
"Just an Echo in the Valley" and
"K-k-k-Katie," swinging on a
| rickety back-fence and watching the
whirlpool of events in Europe. Re
member pictures of Mom and Dad
in the family album?
Maybe Mom was at Stanford then,
and Dad was a Stanford Rough,
resplendent in a stiff collar and hat- j
ing it. There might even be a picture
1 of Mom leaning against one of the

pillars of Inner Quad. She'd be wear
ing an ankle-length blue serge skirt,
topped by a plain white middy.
"Middy?" shrieks someone, re
membering curdling days of middies
worn under compulsion. Yes, in 1915
! I hey loved them. For variety 1 loppy
, ties would shine out in reds, blues,
greens . . . anything bright enough
to make Dad stop and look twice at
Mom in a crowd of middy-clad Stan
j ford women. And she'd wear her
; hair long, pinned on top of her head,
sometimes enlarged with the aid of
| a real-hair rat.
Whoops, My Oear!
By 1925 the case of the missing
waistline became as notorious on
campus as it did throughout the na
tion. Skirts went up to the knees
(knees which hadn't been seen for
1 years except by members of one's
j intimate family), waistlines slipped
| to the high-water boot line, and hats
! zoomed down to rest on the Stan
: ford woman's eyebrows. Bucket hats
were the favorites, suitable for Liti 1 -
i ing out canoes when paddling on
1 Lake Lagunita, supposedly l'or shad
ing the eyes from the sun. And at.
least the 1925 Stanford woman's
1 coiffure was sleek. She'd broken
Grandpaw's heart when she cut off
I the traditional two feet of long
' tresses, hut she had to keep up with
the gals from Cal and acquire a
boy's bob. History doesn't record
whether or not there were "Flappers"
on the Farm, but Stanford is never
more than a year behind the vogues
of the world. (We call it conser
vatism.)
Rack to the Soil
The next 10 years brought with
them the depression and with the
depression, skirts as well as bank
accounts swept lower . . . we were
back to the half-way between the
| ankle and the knee stage, wearing

tight, silhouette skirts. One-piece
knitted dresses and knitted suits
were worn to classes instead of the
sweaters and skirts of this era; while
necklines clutched the throat in soft,
scarf effects. Sleeves were long and
clinging and elbow-action had to be
limited to taking notes in class. Coif
fures we r e fluffier and longer
though still far from shoulder-length
Brenda Frazier style. Tricorns and
berets were the usual hats which
could be seen, yet they were worn

often, a con trust to the present when
hats gather dust in Ihe closets.
So there you have it . . . Stanford's
history of women's fashions, high
lighted at 10-year intervals since
lii()s. It looks as if the only thing we
can be sure of is that in 10 years
someone will be laughing at us!
And a closing prediction . . . skirts
will be getting shorter. See ya in '55!

Ten years later . . . came 1915,

"Just an Echo in the Valley" and
"K-k-k-Katie," swinging on a

member pictures of Mom and Dad
in the family album?
Maybe Mom was at Stanford then,
and Dad was a Stanford Rough,
resplendent in a stiff collar and hat- j
ing it. There might even be a picture
1 of Mom leaning against one of the

pillars of Inner Quad. She'd be wear
ing an ankle-length blue serge skirt,
topped by a plain white middy.
"Middy?" shrieks someone, re
membering curdling days of middies
worn under compulsion. Yes, in 1915
! I hey loved them. For variety 1 loppy
, ties would shine out in reds, blues,
greens . . . anything bright enough
to make Dad stop and look twice at
Mom in a crowd of middy-clad Stan
j ford women. And she'd wear her
; hair long, pinned on top of her head,
sometimes enlarged with the aid of
| a real-hair rat.
Whoops, My Oear!
By 1925 the case of the missing
waistline became as notorious on
campus as it did throughout the na
tion. Skirts went up to the knees
(knees which hadn't been seen for
1 years except by members of one's
j intimate family), waistlines slipped
| to the high-water boot line, and hats
! zoomed down to rest on the Stan
: ford woman's eyebrows. Bucket hats
were the favorites, suitable for Liti 1 -
i ing out canoes when paddling on
1 Lake Lagunita, supposedly l'or shad
ing the eyes from the sun. And at.
least the 1925 Stanford woman's
1 coiffure was sleek. She'd broken
Grandpaw's heart when she cut off
I the traditional two feet of long
' tresses, hut she had to keep up with
the gals from Cal and acquire a
boy's bob. History doesn't record
whether or not there were "Flappers"
on the Farm, but Stanford is never
more than a year behind the vogues
of the world. (We call it conser
vatism.)
Rack to the Soil
The next 10 years brought with
them the depression and with the
depression, skirts as well as bank
accounts swept lower . . . we were
back to the half-way between the
| ankle and the knee stage, wearing

tight, silhouette skirts. One-piece
knitted dresses and knitted suits
were worn to classes instead of the
sweaters and skirts of this era; while
necklines clutched the throat in soft,
scarf effects. Sleeves were long and
clinging and elbow-action had to be
limited to taking notes in class. Coif
fures we r e fluffier and longer
though still far from shoulder-length
Brenda Frazier style. Tricorns and
berets were the usual hats which
could be seen, yet they were worn

often, a con trust to the present when
hats gather dust in Ihe closets.
So there you have it . . . Stanford's
history of women's fashions, high
lighted at 10-year intervals since
lii()s. It looks as if the only thing we
can be sure of is that in 10 years
someone will be laughing at us!
And a closing prediction . . . skirts
will be getting shorter. See ya in '55!
After days of extensive research
we've discovered that there's nothing
stable about Stanford fashions . . .
they've run the ramparts through the
yeais of rustJe-your-bustle 1891 up
j to 11145.
But as for the kind of clothes . . .
| you've got us there. In 1905 Stanford
j women had to watch their step as
they walked the Quad clad in flow

] low, pointed waistline and flouncing
out in one flare of glory 10 inches
or so from the hallowed precincts of
the Law Steps. It was the age of
the Gibson Girl, that frail, yet domi
neering type of womanhood. She
didn't know then that sooner or

were the favorites, suitable for Liti 1 -
i ing out canoes when paddling on

Grandpaw's heart when she cut off
I the traditional two feet of long
' tresses, hut she had to keep up with
the gals from Cal and acquire a
boy's bob. History doesn't record
whether or not there were "Flappers"
on the Farm, but Stanford is never
more than a year behind the vogues
of the world. (We call it conser
vatism.)
Rack to the Soil
The next 10 years brought with
them the depression and with the
depression, skirts as well as bank
accounts swept lower . . . we were
back to the half-way between the
| ankle and the knee stage, wearing

tight, silhouette skirts. One-piece
knitted dresses and knitted suits
were worn to classes instead of the
sweaters and skirts of this era; while
necklines clutched the throat in soft,
scarf effects. Sleeves were long and
clinging and elbow-action had to be
limited to taking notes in class. Coif
fures we r e fluffier and longer
though still far from shoulder-length
Brenda Frazier style. Tricorns and
berets were the usual hats which
could be seen, yet they were worn

often, a con trust to the present when
hats gather dust in Ihe closets.
So there you have it . . . Stanford's
history of women's fashions, high
lighted at 10-year intervals since
lii()s. It looks as if the only thing we
can be sure of is that in 10 years
someone will be laughing at us!
And a closing prediction . . . skirts
will be getting shorter. See ya in '55!
After days of extensive research
we've discovered that there's nothing
stable about Stanford fashions . . .
they've run the ramparts through the
yeais of rustJe-your-bustle 1891 up
j to 11145.
But as for the kind of clothes . . .
| you've got us there. In 1905 Stanford
j women had to watch their step as
they walked the Quad clad in flow
| ing. floor-length gowns, fitted to a
] low, pointed waistline and flouncing
out in one flare of glory 10 inches
or so from the hallowed precincts of
the Law Steps. It was the age of
the Gibson Girl, that frail, yet domi
neering type of womanhood. She
didn't know then that sooner or
later she'd be antique and ;i period
piece : 'or the archives.

| Callously, we look at her now and
note a vague resemblance to a pouter
pigeon. To balance the sensationalism
of her gown, the Gibson-Girl-at-
Stanford was entreated by adver
tisers in The Daily Palo Alto (great
grandmaw of the Stanford Daily) to
buy large, ilower-strewn hats. With
cabbage-roses overflowing the basic
coal-shovel shape of (he hat, Miss
{ Stanford, ILOS wasn't a babe to be
i trifled with. Styles in hatpins were
long and sharp, and she wits a far
cry Irom a I/il Injun Squaw of 1945.
They Loved 'Em Then
Ten years later . . . came 1915,
i and the years while America sang
"Just an Echo in the Valley" and
"K-k-k-Katie," swinging on a
| rickety back-fence and watching the
whirlpool of events in Europe. Re
member pictures of Mom and Dad
in the family album?
Maybe Mom was at Stanford then,
and Dad was a Stanford Rough,
resplendent in a stiff collar and hat- j
ing it. There might even be a picture
1 of Mom leaning against one of the

pillars of Inner Quad. She'd be wear
ing an ankle-length blue serge skirt,
topped by a plain white middy.
"Middy?" shrieks someone, re
membering curdling days of middies
worn under compulsion. Yes, in 1915
! I hey loved them. For variety 1 loppy
, ties would shine out in reds, blues,
greens . . . anything bright enough
to make Dad stop and look twice at
Mom in a crowd of middy-clad Stan
j ford women. And she'd wear her
; hair long, pinned on top of her head,
sometimes enlarged with the aid of
| a real-hair rat.
Whoops, My Oear!
By 1925 the case of the missing
waistline became as notorious on
campus as it did throughout the na
tion. Skirts went up to the knees
(knees which hadn't been seen for
1 years except by members of one's
j intimate family), waistlines slipped
