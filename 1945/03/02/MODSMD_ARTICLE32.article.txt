# Saddles Return To Farm Quad
## 
### 
Since the ban on two-tone shoes
has been lifted, saddles have re
tumed to their popular place on
Quad with skirts and sweaters. Sonic
ills have been able to make the*ii
pre-war saddles last through the
bare years, and those were easier to
keep clean since they had white 01
red rubber soles. The latest saddles
hav soles treated so that they won't
make black marks.
Loafers are still holding their own.
Their popularity is due to the ease
with which they can be slipped off
and on. All white buck shoes are a
favorite.
For dress, the different types of
pumps and patent or reptile skin
sandals are the favorites, either for
treks to the city or for campus so
cial events.
Wallets are popular in place of
purses around e camous an<* i r
shows in Paly. The purses for dress
resemble anything iioin uags 10
boxes. They aren't as larj_e as last
season's purses.
For the occasional trip to the city
for a play or just to get away from
it all, berets, sailors,'half hats, stove
uipes, and skull caps arc the most
popular with Stanford coeds. The
trend in hats as well as purses is
toward smaller ones.
Gloves are always an important
part of the well-dressed Farm
women's apparel, and they range
from the usual short ones to the
ones that brighten up formats at the
hig campus dances. For the early
morning classes furry mittens have
become very popular.
