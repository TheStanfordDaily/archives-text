# Rain Fashions Full of Sparkle
## 
### 
Everyone realizes the importance
of rain clothes at Stanford; the fact
of their necessity is well-nigh un
avoidable, but for years, Stanford
men have endured the disheartening
sight of feminine rain apparel that
was ready for the ashcan.
Perhaps the shortage of "Roughs"
is the reason for the new neatness
and sparkle of rain coats, hats, and
boots that have lately appeared on
Quad and elsewhere. At any rate,
the age of blackish, bedraggled re
versibles, of dirty dish-cloth head
coverings has departed.
Odd Sights Continue
True, there are still some odd
sights to be seen on campus; certain
girls, fearing lor their curls, make
use of the double protection of a
kerchief, and a trusty sou-wester.
At one time, even ear-mutts were
seen on Quad; no one knew the rea
son for their appearance, nor dared
to ask; only the wearers themselves
knew of the mysterious power of
ear-muffs to ward off rain.
But generally, rain coats have
changed from being the most dis
reputable of garments to become as
smart as any other type of coat. The
newest thing for Stanford's re
nowned rainy weather is the "Elk
skin" coat, made of a satiny, water
repellent material, which comes in
the brightest imaginable colors, in
cluding Kelly green, pink, sky-blue,
fuchsia, and black. As a change from
the usual box type rain coats, these
are made in a trench-coat style, with
gathered wrists, belted waist, apd
are usually double-breasted.
Walking- in the Rain
Footwear consists of the old re
liable rubber boots, in while, red,
or black, while co-eds sport bright,
clean plaid, flowered, or plain col
ored kerchiefs to keep the rain
from spoiling their hairdo's.
