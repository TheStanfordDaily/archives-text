## 
### 
The sailor's pea jacket has be
come a favorite among Stanford
women, and possibly inspired the
equally favored bright toppers. Top
pers vary from short boxes to those
copied from the Chinese mandarin
coat 112

Toppers are popular on Quad and
for dress since they allow the skirt to
be seen swinging beneath. Tall girls
should be particularly fond of these
short coats since they break their
height.
