# "Bow Ties —Ughh," Say Roughs; "Frills — Mmm!"

### MacVICAR SHELTON 
"We're looking for some men!"
screamed your two Daily reporters
for the benefit of Row residents as,
notebooks in hand, we set our for
the Cellar, the boathouse, and other
sin centers of campus life to collect
the average Rough's opinion of
Stanford women's dress.
As a result of this campus poll,
we found sweaters and skirts in uni
versal favor for Quad wear, and
that bow ties were in almost uni
versal disfavor.
Mmm. I Like 'em
Dragging Bill Snow away from
his hashing job, we asked his opin
ion on this newest campus fad. "You
ask me that when I hash at the Theta
house!" he exclaimed. "Well, bow
ties are all right, but I'm not so
hot for jeans." However, he came
back with big enthusiasm for men's
sweaters on girls. "Cashmeres?
Mmmm!" was his telling comment.
He Doesn't
Taking the stand for the other
side of the bow tie ledger was Bob
Aitken. Cellar hasher, who said,
"Bow ties? I hate 'em. If I see them
I barf!" He said that he thought
most campus women were sloppy
dressers, but that "they have good
taste in formals."
Pinning Morley Thompson, frosh
president, behind the coke machine
in the Nitery, we extracted this con
fession from him: "I like anything
that's well-pressed. Bobby sox are
0.K., but boys' sweaters on girls
are no good. As for bow ties—that's
going a little too far."
Maguire's O.K.
From there we meandered down
to the Cellar where we found Fred
Maguire deep in the dream of a
chocolate frost. He gave the go
ahead signal to sweaters and skirts
as "appropriate Quad wear"; but
put thumbs down on stockings with
saddles. "There's nothing I hate
more than seeing someone over
dressed on Quad. I think Stanford
women's taste in clothes is only me
diocre," was his verdict.
Michigan's Own
Chuck Letts, importation from the
Middle West, claims that women at

the University of Michigan have bet
ter taste in clothes than have Stan
ford women. "I'm against all the
scrap iron they wear on their wrists,"
he said. He referred to the bracelet
collections featured on Farm arms.
Juniors have the best taste in clothes,
he claims.
Jim Emerson, student manager,
disagreed with Letts' preference for
tailored clothes. "I like frills on
dresses, bow ties—anything cute."
He wants to AC-CEN-SHU-ATE the
femininity. His vote for the best
dressed class went to the seniors.
Short '11' Sweet
Phil I ,ee's desires were short and
sweet: "Shall I say—l like them
dressy?" he queried.
Joe Sher's comment was a little
less short and a little more sweet.
"I'm hot for those things they wear
in summer. You know, white
blouses, flowered skirts, tan legs,
white socks and shoes—oh boy!"
said he, surrounded by a bevy of
Daily reporters wearing blue sweat
ers, plaid skirts, white legs, and bare
feet.
Kid Stuff
Roommates Boris Suhhodin and
Harvey Small joined in a complaint
against the monotony of seeing
women wearing men's sweaters.
"It's too much like high school,"
decided Harvey, from the depth of
his college knowledge.
Hitching a ride to the boat house,
we rescued Willie Davies from his
feminine entourage to pop the all
important questions. "No jeans on
Quad; and the women monopolize
too many of the men's white shirts,"
were his answers. He ix-nayed silly
fads, but said that on the whole
Stanford women "are the best
dressed group I've run across."
Kepulso the First
We spotted Boyd Seymour hold
ing up the Boathouse wall who fol
lowed along with general opinion
against bow ties ("They're repul
sive"), and for tailored clothes; he
nominated the grad women students
for the position of poorest dressers
on campus.
Dick Fayram clambered out of his

canoe with the exclamation "Pedal
pushers are wonderful!" Another
one of his pets were the new ski
clothes featured in Life magazine
this week, he said, as he knocked
himself out over Henrietta Nuss
haurn's terrific taste in clothes.
Sm-o-o-o-th
Charlie Clark's encouraging fare
well words to Stanford women were

"They're fine and smooth. I go for
colorful prints in spiing, and bobby
sox for campus carousing. But 1
think fads are a little on the face
tious side." He joined Dick Fay ram
in his decision that Martha Austin
is the best-dressed campus woman.

ever since junior high school," an
nounced J. I). Williams enthusiasti
cally.

women's taste in clothes is only me
diocre," was his verdict.
Michigan's Own
Chuck Letts, importation from the
Middle West, claims that women at

the University of Michigan have bet
ter taste in clothes than have Stan
ford women. "I'm against all the
scrap iron they wear on their wrists,"
he said. He referred to the bracelet
collections featured on Farm arms.
Juniors have the best taste in clothes,
he claims.
Jim Emerson, student manager,
disagreed with Letts' preference for
tailored clothes. "I like frills on
dresses, bow ties—anything cute."
He wants to AC-CEN-SHU-ATE the
femininity. His vote for the best
dressed class went to the seniors.
Short '11' Sweet
Phil I ,ee's desires were short and
sweet: "Shall I say—l like them
dressy?" he queried.
Joe Sher's comment was a little
less short and a little more sweet.
"I'm hot for those things they wear
in summer. You know, white
blouses, flowered skirts, tan legs,
white socks and shoes—oh boy!"
said he, surrounded by a bevy of
Daily reporters wearing blue sweat
ers, plaid skirts, white legs, and bare
feet.
Kid Stuff
Roommates Boris Suhhodin and
Harvey Small joined in a complaint
against the monotony of seeing
women wearing men's sweaters.
"It's too much like high school,"
decided Harvey, from the depth of
his college knowledge.
Hitching a ride to the boat house,
we rescued Willie Davies from his
feminine entourage to pop the all
important questions. "No jeans on
Quad; and the women monopolize
too many of the men's white shirts,"
were his answers. He ix-nayed silly
fads, but said that on the whole
Stanford women "are the best
dressed group I've run across."
Kepulso the First
We spotted Boyd Seymour hold
ing up the Boathouse wall who fol
lowed along with general opinion
against bow ties ("They're repul
sive"), and for tailored clothes; he
nominated the grad women students
for the position of poorest dressers
on campus.
Dick Fayram clambered out of his

canoe with the exclamation "Pedal
pushers are wonderful!" Another
one of his pets were the new ski
clothes featured in Life magazine
this week, he said, as he knocked
himself out over Henrietta Nuss
haurn's terrific taste in clothes.
Sm-o-o-o-th
Charlie Clark's encouraging fare
well words to Stanford women were

"They're fine and smooth. I go for
colorful prints in spiing, and bobby
sox for campus carousing. But 1
think fads are a little on the face
tious side." He joined Dick Fay ram
in his decision that Martha Austin
is the best-dressed campus woman.
"I've been in love with pleats
ever since junior high school," an
nounced J. I). Williams enthusiasti
cally.
"We're looking for some men!"
screamed your two Daily reporters
for the benefit of Row residents as,
notebooks in hand, we set our for
the Cellar, the boathouse, and other
sin centers of campus life to collect
the average Rough's opinion of
Stanford women's dress.
As a result of this campus poll,
we found sweaters and skirts in uni
versal favor for Quad wear, and
that bow ties were in almost uni
versal disfavor.
Mmm. I Like 'em
Dragging Bill Snow away from
his hashing job, we asked his opin
ion on this newest campus fad. "You
ask me that when I hash at the Theta
house!" he exclaimed. "Well, bow
ties are all right, but I'm not so
hot for jeans." However, he came
back with big enthusiasm for men's
sweaters on girls. "Cashmeres?
Mmmm!" was his telling comment.
He Doesn't
Taking the stand for the other
side of the bow tie ledger was Bob
Aitken. Cellar hasher, who said,
"Bow ties? I hate 'em. If I see them
I barf!" He said that he thought
most campus women were sloppy
dressers, but that "they have good
taste in formals."
Pinning Morley Thompson, frosh
president, behind the coke machine
in the Nitery, we extracted this con
fession from him: "I like anything
that's well-pressed. Bobby sox are
0.K., but boys' sweaters on girls
are no good. As for bow ties—that's
going a little too far."
Maguire's O.K.
From there we meandered down
to the Cellar where we found Fred
Maguire deep in the dream of a
chocolate frost. He gave the go
ahead signal to sweaters and skirts
as "appropriate Quad wear"; but
put thumbs down on stockings with
saddles. "There's nothing I hate
more than seeing someone over
dressed on Quad. I think Stanford
women's taste in clothes is only me

sive"), and for tailored clothes; he
nominated the grad women students
for the position of poorest dressers
on campus.
Dick Fayram clambered out of his

canoe with the exclamation "Pedal
pushers are wonderful!" Another
one of his pets were the new ski
clothes featured in Life magazine
this week, he said, as he knocked
himself out over Henrietta Nuss
haurn's terrific taste in clothes.
Sm-o-o-o-th
Charlie Clark's encouraging fare
well words to Stanford women were

"They're fine and smooth. I go for
colorful prints in spiing, and bobby
sox for campus carousing. But 1
think fads are a little on the face
tious side." He joined Dick Fay ram
in his decision that Martha Austin
is the best-dressed campus woman.
"I've been in love with pleats
ever since junior high school," an
nounced J. I). Williams enthusiasti
cally.
"We're looking for some men!"
screamed your two Daily reporters
for the benefit of Row residents as,
notebooks in hand, we set our for
the Cellar, the boathouse, and other
sin centers of campus life to collect
the average Rough's opinion of
Stanford women's dress.
As a result of this campus poll,
we found sweaters and skirts in uni
versal favor for Quad wear, and
that bow ties were in almost uni
versal disfavor.
Mmm. I Like 'em
Dragging Bill Snow away from
his hashing job, we asked his opin
ion on this newest campus fad. "You
ask me that when I hash at the Theta
house!" he exclaimed. "Well, bow
ties are all right, but I'm not so
hot for jeans." However, he came
back with big enthusiasm for men's
sweaters on girls. "Cashmeres?
Mmmm!" was his telling comment.
He Doesn't
Taking the stand for the other
side of the bow tie ledger was Bob
Aitken. Cellar hasher, who said,
"Bow ties? I hate 'em. If I see them
I barf!" He said that he thought
most campus women were sloppy
dressers, but that "they have good
taste in formals."
Pinning Morley Thompson, frosh
president, behind the coke machine
in the Nitery, we extracted this con
fession from him: "I like anything
that's well-pressed. Bobby sox are
0.K., but boys' sweaters on girls
are no good. As for bow ties—that's
going a little too far."
Maguire's O.K.
From there we meandered down
to the Cellar where we found Fred
Maguire deep in the dream of a
chocolate frost. He gave the go
ahead signal to sweaters and skirts
as "appropriate Quad wear"; but
put thumbs down on stockings with
saddles. "There's nothing I hate
more than seeing someone over
dressed on Quad. I think Stanford
women's taste in clothes is only me
diocre," was his verdict.
Michigan's Own
Chuck Letts, importation from the
Middle West, claims that women at

the University of Michigan have bet
ter taste in clothes than have Stan
ford women. "I'm against all the
scrap iron they wear on their wrists,"
he said. He referred to the bracelet
collections featured on Farm arms.
Juniors have the best taste in clothes,
he claims.
Jim Emerson, student manager,
disagreed with Letts' preference for
tailored clothes. "I like frills on
dresses, bow ties—anything cute."
He wants to AC-CEN-SHU-ATE the
femininity. His vote for the best
dressed class went to the seniors.
Short '11' Sweet
Phil I ,ee's desires were short and
sweet: "Shall I say—l like them
dressy?" he queried.
Joe Sher's comment was a little
less short and a little more sweet.
"I'm hot for those things they wear
in summer. You know, white
blouses, flowered skirts, tan legs,
white socks and shoes—oh boy!"
said he, surrounded by a bevy of
Daily reporters wearing blue sweat
ers, plaid skirts, white legs, and bare
feet.
Kid Stuff
Roommates Boris Suhhodin and
Harvey Small joined in a complaint
against the monotony of seeing
women wearing men's sweaters.
"It's too much like high school,"
decided Harvey, from the depth of
his college knowledge.
Hitching a ride to the boat house,
we rescued Willie Davies from his
feminine entourage to pop the all
important questions. "No jeans on
Quad; and the women monopolize
too many of the men's white shirts,"
were his answers. He ix-nayed silly
fads, but said that on the whole
Stanford women "are the best
dressed group I've run across."
Kepulso the First
We spotted Boyd Seymour hold

lowed along with general opinion
