# Scarce but Present, Roughs Still Prefer Levis, Sweaters On Quad, Casuals for Dates
## 
### 
Levis, T-shirts, cashmeres—all but
the dirty saddle shoes — are still
number one items in the wardrobe
of the Stanford "rough," who may
still be seen (if you look long
enough) wandering his way through
the crowds of women on Quad.
Occasions demanding smoother
apparel still find the Stanford man
| maintaining his casual air—Western
style they call it — with emphasis
placed on light suits, gabardines,
tweeds, or .slacks and sport coat.
Tuxes take the spotlight at campus
formats; dark suits for city dates.
Afternoons at the Boathouse find
Stanford servicemen and civilians
indulging a starved color sense in
bathing suit fashions—solid colors,
plaids, but primarily in Hawaiian
prints. Colored and print sport
shirts also make their entrance.
Ties, of every hue, design, and
shape, are another outlet for pent
up fashion fancies. Lagunita hash
ers have stormed the campus with
the Sinatra touch—huge bow ties in
blazing red and blue, polka dot,
plaid, and checks. The conservative
trend is toward hand-woven wools
in stripes, plaids, or plain colors.
What cashmere sweaters there are
on campus are primarily pre-war,
especially those in yellow, green, or

light blue. And many are worn by
women to whom they have been en
trusted "for the duration" by broth
ers and friends.
As with women's fashions, the
trend in men's styles continues to
ward the casual and the comfortable,
with enough of the military influ
ence to guard against complete lax
ity.
