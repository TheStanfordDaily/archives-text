# Hidden Interests Revealed on Farm Women's Bulletin Board
## 
### 
"You're so different, Harold" is
the caption over a picture of an ape
on one Stanford co-ed's bulletin
board. Harold of course refers to
her boy friend.
A survey was made recently of
girls' bulletin boards in the various
living groups all over the campus to
find what the girls are currently
featuring on their boards and what
some of the more original ideas are.
Valentines Linger
Tops on the list for this time of
year are valentines of all sorts. Even
though Valentine's Day was several
weeks ago, girls have treir treasured
one or two valentines which they
received proudly displayed on their
bulletin boards —to remain prob
ably until May baskets, Easter cards
or even next year's Christmas cards
replace them.
Some of the girls have large red
heart doilies (not dog food) trimmed
in white lace on display which they
received at special valentine dinners
in some of the halls.
Bull Board Borders
The bull boards are all decorated
with ribbons, frills, and rul'lles. The
ribbons usually match some of the
furniture or rugs in the rooms or
are red with a red and white Stan
ford banner below them. Some girls
have ruffles to match their draperies
or big organdy frills.
Freshman boards often have re
membrances of the first events at
Stanford such as copies of the Stan
ford Hymn and other songs, ban
ners, special Roble dinner menus,
and other novelties pertaining to
Stanford life. Pictures of high school
friends are frequently seen.
Men
All girls have pictures of men
somewhere on their boards, whether

tj>ey be current or past flames or
movie stars such as Van Johnson and
Cary Grant, who are the favorites.
One "Frustration" bull board con
sisted of pictures of past and pres
ent boy friends at the top with Jon
Whitcomb illustrations adorning the
sides.
"I always keep a final examination
schedule in the middle of my bulle
tin board so that when I get lazy,
I'll be constantly reminded to study,"
one girl said. Other ideas along this
line are unpaid bills and receipts for
paid ones, and announcements of
coming cultural programs.
The Zoo Variety
Another girl has a collection of
pictures of cats and has built out her

board in the middle so she can put
little figures of cats on it, Another
board was devoted almost entirely
to pictures of dogs left behind at
home.
Most boards contain dance bids,
dried-out corsages, orchids —if the
girl has been lucky—programs from
cultural and other types of events
in San Francisco and on campus,
pictures of men, snapshots of past
and present good times (mostly
past), pictures of men, telegrams,
pictures of men, notes from room
mates, and pictures of men.

Cne girl turns her Air Corps fly
er's picture face inward when she
doesn't receive a letter from him for

a while. When a letter arrives, the
picture again smiles at her.
Other bulletin board collections
include train and ferry ticket stubs
from the first trip to the Farm, mili
tary insignia, and such signs as
"Have you forgotten any personal
property?" and "Dining car in op
posite direction."
The Poet
Poetry is also popular on most
bull boards as evidenced by this
one:

, Who borrows all your ready cash?
, Who smokes the last one in your
| pack?
Your roommate.
! Who breaks the furniture and the
i lamps?
Who uses all the postage stamps?
Your roommate.
But who's a constant pal to you?
j Who overlooks the things you do J
| Who knows and loves you through
and tluough?
Your mother.

Most boards contain dance bids,
dried-out corsages, orchids —if the
girl has been lucky—programs from
cultural and other types of events
in San Francisco and on campus,
pictures of men, snapshots of past
and present good times (mostly
past), pictures of men, telegrams,
pictures of men, notes from room
mates, and pictures of men.

Other bulletin board collections
include train and ferry ticket stubs
from the first trip to the Farm, mili

"Have you forgotten any personal

The Poet
Poetry is also popular on most
bull boards as evidenced by this
one:

, Who borrows all your ready cash?
, Who smokes the last one in your
| pack?
Your roommate.
! Who breaks the furniture and the
i lamps?
Who uses all the postage stamps?
Your roommate.
But who's a constant pal to you?
j Who overlooks the things you do J
| Who knows and loves you through
and tluough?
Your mother.

A survey was made recently of
girls' bulletin boards in the various
living groups all over the campus to
find what the girls are currently
featuring on their boards and what
some of the more original ideas are.
Valentines Linger
Tops on the list for this time of
year are valentines of all sorts. Even
though Valentine's Day was several
weeks ago, girls have treir treasured
one or two valentines which they
received proudly displayed on their
bulletin boards —to remain prob
ably until May baskets, Easter cards
or even next year's Christmas cards
replace them.
Some of the girls have large red
heart doilies (not dog food) trimmed
in white lace on display which they
received at special valentine dinners
in some of the halls.
Bull Board Borders
The bull boards are all decorated
with ribbons, frills, and rul'lles. The
ribbons usually match some of the
furniture or rugs in the rooms or
are red with a red and white Stan
ford banner below them. Some girls
have ruffles to match their draperies
or big organdy frills.
Freshman boards often have re
membrances of the first events at
Stanford such as copies of the Stan
ford Hymn and other songs, ban
ners, special Roble dinner menus,
and other novelties pertaining to
Stanford life. Pictures of high school
friends are frequently seen.
Men
All girls have pictures of men
somewhere on their boards, whether

tj>ey be current or past flames or
movie stars such as Van Johnson and
Cary Grant, who are the favorites.
One "Frustration" bull board con
sisted of pictures of past and pres
ent boy friends at the top with Jon
Whitcomb illustrations adorning the
sides.
"I always keep a final examination
schedule in the middle of my bulle
tin board so that when I get lazy,
I'll be constantly reminded to study,"
one girl said. Other ideas along this
line are unpaid bills and receipts for
paid ones, and announcements of
coming cultural programs.

pictures of cats and has built out her

board in the middle so she can put
little figures of cats on it, Another
board was devoted almost entirely
to pictures of dogs left behind at
home.
