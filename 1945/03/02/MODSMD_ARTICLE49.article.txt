# Hair Goes Up on Top In Coronet Braids
## 
### 
Hair styles at Stanford are veer
ing to the exotic lately. Women who
have long hair, instead of wearing
it Veronica Lake style, as before,
now braid it and arrange their locks

in a coronet on the top of their
heads.
We have seen heads that are piled
high with two or three tiers of
braids.
