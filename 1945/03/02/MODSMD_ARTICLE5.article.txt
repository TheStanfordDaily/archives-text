# NOT BACK TO NORMALCY
## 
### 
The first Fashion Edition in four years is not a collegiate
attempt to pretend that things are back to normalcy.
Clothes during the war have, however, preserved the Amer
ican woman's desire to be individual, to be original, and to be
gay. It is a part of American life, satirized by Easter hats and
overburdened handbags, that most Americans value.
The Daily, then, records this other aspect of war, and feels
that the difficulties of obtaining equipment, plaguing over
burdened advertisers, and calling upon students with full pro
grams is justified by a desire to make the most of what individual
contributions can offer to the war years.
