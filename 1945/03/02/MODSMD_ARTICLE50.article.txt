# Your Bare Legs Show, You Hussy!

### MAKION BUSII 
If Stanford women of 1937 could
see us now they would give us back
to Paly High or Market Street from
whence they would be sure we had
come. They would be aghast at the
great expense of BARE legs between
the end of socks and the beginning
of skirts, and would consider us a
pretty rough crew of hussies who
didn't know better.
In the last seven years we have
gradually keyed our outfits to com
fort, practicability, and war - time
shortages, until even the grad stu
dents can't remember having ever
seen a polished, sophisticated Stan
ford woman. If the faculty were at
all conscious of feminine fashion and
its finer points they could astound
us with a few facts, but more likely
they are still absent-mindedly hop
ing for a glimpse of a slim white
ankle beneath long dark skirts.
Don'ts for '37
In a 1937 fashion edition of the
Daily we find a firm Dame Fashion
has decreed several "don'ts" . . . the
first and firmest being aloud objec
tion to too short shorts. Says she,
"They are actually showing them
just above the knee this season!"
The length of skirts came in for a
heated discussion in the "good old
days" just as they do now. Stanford
women, or at least most of them,
still maintain that no one's knees are
attractive enough to merit constant
exhibition.
Conservative!
Skirts of 1937 had their proper
place at a point just above the calf.
Polo coats were meant to clear the
ground by a good 12 inches. Less
casual dresses reached a new high
in the spring of that year when the
more daring burst forth in "wander
lust prints" 16 inches from terra
firm a.
Long stockings disappeared from
Quad not so long ago that none of
us can remember the tradition, but
then they were combined with socks.
The sight of long stockings, saddle
shoes, and nothing else would leave
us feeling cool around the ankles.
Yet this was the accepted style.
Colors for Seasons
What's more you were fashionably
out of it if you didn't wear gray
hose in the winter, red hose in the
fall and beige in the spring. Stan
ford ankle socks belonged to active
sports and Saturday mornings.
Another emphatic don't was aimed
at cracked nail enamel. That still
goes, but here the 1937 writer and
the present one part company, for
rne "ancient" goes on to strongly
object and condemn the deeper tones
of polish, "especially in the early
morning."
Jewel Bedecked
Jewelry must have been more im
portant (besides being sans tax) than
it is now, for those fashionably in
the know advised Stanford women

to wear six or seven strands of pearls
at once or not to wear any at all.
Little single strands of pearls were
definitely out.
Sweaters are too choice a subject
to leave out. Here the women of
1945 and 1937 change sides. Sweat
ers used to be worn short and
tighter than they are now. They had
puffed sleeves, round necks and were
worn without a blouse. Most of them
were garnished with bows, little
pockets, and holes that were meant
to be designs, showed the sweater
was cleverly made.
In 1945 we find that the ultimate
aim of Stanford women is to con
ceal everything from the shoulders
down to the thigh line.

ankle beneath long dark skirts.
Don'ts for '37
In a 1937 fashion edition of the
Daily we find a firm Dame Fashion
has decreed several "don'ts" . . . the
first and firmest being aloud objec
tion to too short shorts. Says she,
"They are actually showing them
just above the knee this season!"
The length of skirts came in for a
heated discussion in the "good old
days" just as they do now. Stanford
women, or at least most of them,
still maintain that no one's knees are
attractive enough to merit constant
exhibition.
Conservative!
Skirts of 1937 had their proper
place at a point just above the calf.
Polo coats were meant to clear the
ground by a good 12 inches. Less
casual dresses reached a new high
in the spring of that year when the
more daring burst forth in "wander
lust prints" 16 inches from terra
firm a.
Long stockings disappeared from
Quad not so long ago that none of
us can remember the tradition, but
then they were combined with socks.
The sight of long stockings, saddle
shoes, and nothing else would leave
us feeling cool around the ankles.
Yet this was the accepted style.
Colors for Seasons
What's more you were fashionably
out of it if you didn't wear gray
hose in the winter, red hose in the
fall and beige in the spring. Stan
ford ankle socks belonged to active
sports and Saturday mornings.
Another emphatic don't was aimed
at cracked nail enamel. That still
goes, but here the 1937 writer and
the present one part company, for
rne "ancient" goes on to strongly
object and condemn the deeper tones
of polish, "especially in the early
morning."
Jewel Bedecked
Jewelry must have been more im
portant (besides being sans tax) than
it is now, for those fashionably in
the know advised Stanford women

to wear six or seven strands of pearls
at once or not to wear any at all.
Little single strands of pearls were
definitely out.
Sweaters are too choice a subject
to leave out. Here the women of
1945 and 1937 change sides. Sweat
ers used to be worn short and
tighter than they are now. They had
puffed sleeves, round necks and were
worn without a blouse. Most of them
were garnished with bows, little
pockets, and holes that were meant
to be designs, showed the sweater
was cleverly made.
In 1945 we find that the ultimate
aim of Stanford women is to con
ceal everything from the shoulders
down to the thigh line.
If Stanford women of 1937 could
see us now they would give us back
to Paly High or Market Street from
whence they would be sure we had
come. They would be aghast at the
great expense of BARE legs between
the end of socks and the beginning
of skirts, and would consider us a
pretty rough crew of hussies who
didn't know better.
In the last seven years we have
gradually keyed our outfits to com
fort, practicability, and war - time
shortages, until even the grad stu
dents can't remember having ever
seen a polished, sophisticated Stan
ford woman. If the faculty were at
all conscious of feminine fashion and
its finer points they could astound
us with a few facts, but more likely
they are still absent-mindedly hop
ing for a glimpse of a slim white
ankle beneath long dark skirts.
