# Pajama Fashions Boil Down To How to Beat the Laundry
## 
### 
We're looking at a typical drawer in any Stanford women's dorm or
house. It's the beginning of a quarter and, among other things, five outfits
of bed-clothes arc tucked in one corner.
We say five because any Stanford woman, after a quarter of Math 1,
knows that with ten weeks in a quarter, she'll just have to wash each

pair of pajamas once before stuffing
them into her suitcase and dropping
them onto her mother's doorstep.
Tommies
She'll prol:ably start the quarter
with a short nightgown, according
to prescribed "Mademoiselle" fash
ion. Short nightgowns equal nothing
more than slightly elongated pajama
tops —it all amounts to the same
thing when a breeze is whistling
through a draughty corridor. Most
"tommies" are made on plain shirt
waist lines, having a V-neck, short
sleeves, and buttoning down the
front. Some of the more femiaine
varieties have long, puffy sleeves and
button up at the neck to Peter Pan
collars.
By the third week, our after-dark
fashion plate will probably have her
"tommies" in the bottom of her laun
dry bag and will be wearing a pair
of men's pajamas—preferably size 40
with bright stripes. Her prestige will
depend entirely upon the degree to
which the pajamas drag the ground
and upon the color combination.
Any girl with red and white polka
dotted size 48's is hailed as queen
of her corridor.
Mid-Terms Approach
Fifth-week fashions, or what the
well-dressed girl will wear to mid
night coffee sessions in the kitchen
ette around mid-term time, will
probably amount to a man's flannel
nightgown. Again the rule about
size and stripes will apply.
As for the other two bed-time out
fits which haven't been described,
they'll probably be duplicates of the
other three, or they might even be
of drab variety found in 'teen-age
tots' shoppe. If the latter were the
case, the wearer would be black
listed if she dared venture beyond
her locked door in her pajamas.
