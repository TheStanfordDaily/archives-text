To those women of Stanford who, in spite of wartime changes,
have maintained a high standard of simplicity and good taste in
dress this Fashion Edition of The Daily is dedicated.
Today, with a women's enrollment larger than at any time
in University history, co-eds have a diversity of interests and
activities that exceed in scope any of those of the pre-war "Ivory
Tower" years. With winter quarter drawing to a close, a balance
is appearing between new and old students. Freshmen, on the
whole, are conforming to patterns of dress maintained through
years of University life; older women are recognizing new stu
dents' individuality and their potential contributions to the cam
pus. They realize that Stanford women can no longer be "typed,"
but that they can uphold the high standards of fashion set by
women who know how to make up their minds.
With this in mind the staff of the Fashion Edition has set itself
the task of outlining not what the women of Stanford must wear,
but what they are wearing and what is available to them to wear.
