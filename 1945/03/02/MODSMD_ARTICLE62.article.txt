## 
### 
PARIS, March 1 (UP).â€”The great Ruhr industrial center of Muenchen
Gladbach fell to the U. S. Ninth Army yesterday.
U. S. troops also battled into Trier and laid seige to Cologne as the
triple Amercan assault through the Rhineland rolled on.
Muenchen Gladbach toppled yesterday afternoon after a swift two-day

assault that also swept up its south
ern suburb. Muenchen had a pre
war population of 127,000 and with
its suburb is the largest German city
taken so far by the Americans.
A German military radio broadcast
said a Ninth Army tank spearhead
already had swept behind Muenchen
to the outskirts of Krefeld, six miles
north and the second greatest Ruhr
industrial city west of the Rhine.
Field dispatches indicated the fall
of Trier was imminent with four
tank columns pounding the city.
