# Farm Red Cross Drive Picks Up With $432 Gain
## 
### 
Two living groups went 100 per
cent and eight others turned in their
Red Cross drive contributions yes
terday to bring Stanford $432 nearer
its drive goal of $3,000, according to
Treasurer Franky Mclnnis.
Those living groups who went 100
per cent were: Storey House with
$69, and Roble 1A with $40. Other
groups who contributed were Jessie
Jordan, $31.50; Sequoia Hall, $40;
Juniper Lodge, $28; Branner 3rd
floor 2 center, $35; Union Residence,
$72.25; Branner 2E, $31; Ist year Med
School, $64; and International Club,
$21.25.
With these contributions and with
the money donated by two houses
the first day of the drive, Stanford's
current total is $586. "We're very de
lighted at the response," said Miss
; Mclnnis, but she urged the repre
j sentatives ftf the halls who have not
; yet collected their kits to do so im
j mediately.
All students who do not live in a
j University residence can turn their
â–  money in to Miss Mclnnis at the
! ASSU office from 4 to 5 on Mon
: day and from 3 to 5 on Tuesday
; through Friday. Every student has
j been asked to contribute at least $2
| to help Stanford do its part for this
j urgent cause.
The drive, which will last until
March 10, is under the chairmanship
of Charmian Kolar, with her assist
| ants: Jack Siemer, men's collections;

Gloria Cassidy, women's collections;
Georgean Lightner, window display;
Beth van Hoesen, posters; and Miss
Mclnnis.
The need for relief is more urgent
now than in almost any time in Red
Cross history. Every student should
give as much as he can to speed the
work of this vital organization.
