# "1812"

Russia might have produced a lot of things
since the revolution, but the recent film "1812,"
which has just ended a run at the Larkin Theater
in San Francisco, has proved that a good cinema
is not one of them.
Based on Leo Tolstoy's novel, "War and
Peace," the film used, as its main characters, the
high officers on both sides during Napoleon's
invasion of Russia. The simple, human men of
the ranks whom Tolstoy portrayed so well were
cut out.
Kutusoff, the Russian commander, was, of
course, portrayed as more of a general than he
really was, and the usual historic license was
taken with the campaign. Artkino, the American
company releasing the film, got the old White
Army officer, Sergei Kournikoff, to give a not
unbiased interperative narrative on the whole
affair.
But mostly the production was notable for
its lack of good acting and good photographic
technique. Everytime a cannon was supposed
to go off, somebody blew a cloud of smoke up
under the camera. One actor, who was supposed
to have been shot in a big battle scene, took
about 5 minutes to fall off his horse.
The actor portraying the Tsar would make
statuesque poses for several minutes after he
finished talking, and Kutusoff's portrayer, try
ing to get the effect of an always calm, all-see
ing man, practically spoke in a slow monotone.
The American designation for all this would be
"ham acting."
However, it is interesting to see a Soviet film
which Russia advertised as an epic production.
Much has been heard about how good they
are, but one must come to the inevitable con
clusion that more will have to be done to the
Russian movie technique before they will go
over with the average American audience.
