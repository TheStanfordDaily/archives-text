Question of the quarter—Why the lights in the
Hoover Tower ?? ?? ??
Is it a landing beacon for little green heliocops? A
playground for stray fire-flies? Or maybe an illumi
nated reenhouse which supplies the University dining
halls with their string beans?
Until recently any one of these explanations was

possible. But, now a series of thought waves from Dr.
Beetsom of the Murvanian firm of Mectsom, Beetsom
and Cleatsom, tell us that from the Tower he has been
observing surface people through his trinpculars.
And his studies of life at Stanford: Where the Elite
Meet Defeat—has set him wondering.
He wonders . . .
... If students will start drinking the Farm's chlori
nated water once they learn that it is 83 proof.
... If those new 4-F license plates make the drivers
feel uneasy.
... If the frogs in Lagunita Lake are subject to
"quiet hours."
... If the campus knows that Cap't Brown and the
ASTudents (Co A and Co. C) subscribed to The DAILY
—voluntarily.
... If the "PHANTOM" will ever forgive the Bull
Sessioner fpr being so foolish. But he's fortunate—
this is the last week of publication.
... If reeb suds readings will maintain their present
highway popularity. Those "Your Future in Foam"
signs need repairs.
... If that divot-devouring cow will be penalized
for widening the fairways of the sixth and seventh
holes on the golf course.
... If Clyde is still out-staring lions in Darkest
Africa.
... If the plan for a gambling ship on Lager-nita
Lake will go through.
Of course, there is the problem of the three mile
limit. But with the entire Stanford family on the ship,
it will displace enough water to spread the measure
ments of the lake to at least six miles by six miles.
With the ship in the center, it would be neither inside
nor outside of the limit-line—but on it. Any rouqil
(forward it smells rouqil) flown there by batmen would
not be transported on campus, but on board ship. All
as perfectly legal as the roulette wheels manned by
slave labor imported from the Civ Libe.
More power to the Tower.

... If students will start drinking the Farm's chlori
nated water once they learn that it is 83 proof.
... If those new 4-F license plates make the drivers
feel uneasy.
... If the frogs in Lagunita Lake are subject to
"quiet hours."
... If the campus knows that Cap't Brown and the
ASTudents (Co A and Co. C) subscribed to The DAILY
—voluntarily.
... If the "PHANTOM" will ever forgive the Bull
Sessioner fpr being so foolish. But he's fortunate—
this is the last week of publication.
... If reeb suds readings will maintain their present
highway popularity. Those "Your Future in Foam"
signs need repairs.
... If that divot-devouring cow will be penalized
for widening the fairways of the sixth and seventh
holes on the golf course.
... If Clyde is still out-staring lions in Darkest
Africa.
... If the plan for a gambling ship on Lager-nita
Lake will go through.
Of course, there is the problem of the three mile
limit. But with the entire Stanford family on the ship,
it will displace enough water to spread the measure
ments of the lake to at least six miles by six miles.
With the ship in the center, it would be neither inside
nor outside of the limit-line—but on it. Any rouqil
(forward it smells rouqil) flown there by batmen would
not be transported on campus, but on board ship. All
as perfectly legal as the roulette wheels manned by
slave labor imported from the Civ Libe.
More power to the Tower.
