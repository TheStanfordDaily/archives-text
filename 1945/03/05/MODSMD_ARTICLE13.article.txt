To the Editor:
It was recommended by the Honor Code Committee
that examinations not be taken from classrooms, to
help maintain the high ideals and traditions of the
Code. We believe that such a recommendation can only
serve to weaken the Honor Code.
Those favoring the plan say that the third person
responsibility cannot work when you take your exami
nation outside of the classroom. This stand assumes
that our Honor Code works because the students check
on each other, rather than each individual feeling his
personal responsibility for upholding the Code.
Stanford is unique among universities because we
can take our exams out of the classroom if it is crowded
to concentration. This is one of the privileges which
or perhaps another place would be more conducive
makes us particularly proud of our Stanford way of life.
When we are out of college there will be no third
person to check on us. Our sense of personal responsi
bility will direct our actions.
The third person responsibility's part of the Honor
Code, but does that mean that we must not allow a
student to be on his honor unless other students are
there to check on him?
