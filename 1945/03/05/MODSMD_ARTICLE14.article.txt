The Editor, sir:
Having read the proposed change in the choosing of
members of Excom, as a graduate of both Stanford and
the Executive Committee may I point out the defects
that I saw in the new plan.
It seems to me that your electees from the living
groups would be mainly seniors and juniors . . . except
for Roble's frosh member . . . and you would lose your
sophomore representation.
Also, might not a certain amount of interest be lost ...
"all-campus" elections seem to stir people up a great
deal more than the ones in which a living group partici
pates. In the past there have been instances when
there was a marked lack of interest in studenl body
oil ices, and it does not seem likely that the suggested
plan would help the situation any. In fact, I think it
would have the opposite effect.
Sincerely yours,
Emily Howard Haffner, '44
