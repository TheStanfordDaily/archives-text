# Farm Revives Olympic Day Customs; Students Invited To Enter Contests
## 
### 
Olympic Day is a revival of an old
Stanford custom, the Irish Marathon,
which included such classics as the
20-mile relay. Not as strenuous but
quite as much fun will be the Olym
pic Day next Saturday at 2 p.m.,
according to B. J. Rucker, co-chair
man. The events are to precede the
Sadie Hawkins dance.
Anyone can enter the contests, but
if the number of entries for the
various races is unequal, the entry
committee will see that enough sign
up for each event. B. J. Calfee,
Lathrop House, is in charge of en
tries, which are due Wednesday
at 5 p.m. The play-off will be in the
sunken baseball diamond.
Freshman, sophomore, junior, and
senior classes will compete tor prizes,
each student entering for his class.
To balance the ledger. ASTP students
will be divided between the sopho

more and junior classes. First year |
med students will join the juniors,
and second year med students will
join the seniors. The faculty will
enter as a special group.
