# 'Little Fox' Set Crews Create 1900 Atmosphere
## 
### 
■ Costume-and stage crews are busy
working to be ready for the opening
of "The Little Foxes" by Lillian
Hellman, Wednesday at 8:15 p.m.
in the Little Theater of Memorial
Hall.
Costumes will be done in the style
of 1900 with floor-length skirts in
the "Kangaroo stance" for the
en, and narrow trouser legs and. stiff
collars for the men. Some of the
costumes have been donated to the
committee, and costume committee
is renting some and making others
over.
Necklines Low
The necklines on the dresses dur
ing that period were usually low
and hair was worn in a knot or
French twist in back. Regina, played
by Sally- Stocker, will wear a black
net dress with sequins in one scene.
She will also wear a dog collar
around her neck and carry a fan.
Alexandra, played by Mary Lou
Patton, will wear an aqua dress of
shorter length as she is only 17 in
the play. She will also wear a gold
locket.
Plumed Hats
Plumed hats were also in style then
as well as white kid gloves, but the
lighting effects would be bad on the
gloves so they will not be used.
The men in the play will wear
four-in-hand ties which have smaller
knots than those today, and detach
able collars and cuffs. Evening
clothes will be worn in the first act,
and from then on, business suits.
Costumes are under the direction
of Betty Wattenberger, and members
of the costumes classes are assisting
her.
Victorian Staircase
The stage will be dominated by a
heavy elaborate Victorian staircase

upon which much of the dramatic
action of the play is centered. Lyn
Shrader, an architectural student,
designed it. The walls will be cov
ered with an intricate wall paper
pattern.
The set follows the general plan
of New York set where the play was
first produced. There will be oil
lamps, a gas chandalier, and red
plush furniture. "The room is fur
nished very expensively, but has
little taste; it is ornate but ugly,"
Mr. John Sollers, technical director
said. "It is typical of the newly-rich
industrial class of 1900 around which
the play centers."
Mr. Sollei*s is in charge of the
set. He is assisted by Walter Garms,
stage 'manager; Jody Shraeder and
Eugenia Mitchell, lights; Marie Jo
McGervey, Lorna Robertson, and
Jean Saulsbury, properties.

ered with an intricate wall paper
pattern.
The set follows the general plan
of New York set where the play was
first produced. There will be oil
lamps, a gas chandalier, and red
plush furniture. "The room is fur
nished very expensively, but has
little taste; it is ornate but ugly,"
Mr. John Sollers, technical director
said. "It is typical of the newly-rich
industrial class of 1900 around which
the play centers."
Mr. Sollei*s is in charge of the
set. He is assisted by Walter Garms,
stage 'manager; Jody Shraeder and
Eugenia Mitchell, lights; Marie Jo
McGervey, Lorna Robertson, and
Jean Saulsbury, properties.
■ Costume-and stage crews are busy
working to be ready for the opening
of "The Little Foxes" by Lillian
Hellman, Wednesday at 8:15 p.m.
in the Little Theater of Memorial
Hall.
Costumes will be done in the style
of 1900 with floor-length skirts in
the "Kangaroo stance" for the
en, and narrow trouser legs and. stiff
collars for the men. Some of the
costumes have been donated to the
committee, and costume committee
is renting some and making others
over.
Necklines Low
The necklines on the dresses dur
ing that period were usually low
and hair was worn in a knot or
French twist in back. Regina, played
by Sally- Stocker, will wear a black
net dress with sequins in one scene.
She will also wear a dog collar
around her neck and carry a fan.
Alexandra, played by Mary Lou
Patton, will wear an aqua dress of
shorter length as she is only 17 in
the play. She will also wear a gold
locket.
Plumed Hats
Plumed hats were also in style then
as well as white kid gloves, but the
lighting effects would be bad on the
gloves so they will not be used.
The men in the play will wear
four-in-hand ties which have smaller
knots than those today, and detach
able collars and cuffs. Evening
clothes will be worn in the first act,
and from then on, business suits.
Costumes are under the direction
of Betty Wattenberger, and members
of the costumes classes are assisting
her.
Victorian Staircase
The stage will be dominated by a
heavy elaborate Victorian staircase

upon which much of the dramatic
action of the play is centered. Lyn
Shrader, an architectural student,
designed it. The walls will be cov
ered with an intricate wall paper
pattern.
