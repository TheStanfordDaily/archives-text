# Get-Acquainted Plan Accepted
## 
### 
A campus-wide program begin
ning next quarter to acquaint fresh
men with sophomore and upper divi
sion women was recommended by
women's Housing Committee in its
meeting Thursday night, and Mary
lou McClure, Pam Straithairn, and
Phyllis Sutherland were appointed
as a sub-committee to work out
plans.
Committee members felt that a
program of informal entertainment
to familiarize new students with the
different living groups and various
methods of group living would help
to bring about as well as broaden
acquaintanceship between upper and
lower division women.
A majority of those present ex
pressed approval of a plan which
would extend the present "choice by
lot" system used in University resi
dences to all women's living groups;
however, no conclusive action was
taken.
Believing that the distribution of
transfer students throughout all
women's residences would allow
transfers to be better assimilated
into campus life, the committee
moved that transfer students be as
signed to residences proportionately.
It was also suggested that transfers
be allowed to express a preference
for small or larger (cusa-type) size
living groups on their room applica
tion.
More complete coverage by The
Daily and a vote of confidence by
the women's residences on the com
mittee's final decisions were two
points emphasized by a non-member
present at the meeting.
