### 
At 12:01 this morning the afghan
knitting contest —sponsored to meet
the Red Cross request for those
afghans urgently needed at war
fronts and disaster centers—officially
opened.
The contest will extend through
J this week, closing at midnight next
i Sunday, March 11, according to
Emily Metzger, knitting chairman
| and head of the competition. How
! ever, no squares knitted before mid
l night, Sunday, March 4 may be
admitted in the final count and all
finished squares must be turned in
!at the War Board office before 5
j p.m. March 12.
Competition for the final grand
j prize, the nature of which is to re-
I main a secret until the close'of the
contest, will be by living groups.
Houses entering the contest must
register with Miss Metzger at the
j War Board office, however. Each
! War Board representative has direc
< tions for the knitting of the squares.
Afghans are used by the Red Cross
I for the relief of both soldiers and
j civilians. They provide warmth and
I comfort for disaster victims at relief
| centers as well as for wounded serv
icemen convalescing in hospitals.
The Red Cross needs these afghans
and by knitting squares every stu-
I dent can directly aid in the war qf
i fort, said Miss 'Metzger in urging
; ill students to enter Hie contest.
