# $800 Collected Toward Drive Goal of $3,000
## 
### 
Red Cross donations continued to
mount Friday as more living groups
turned in ther contributions to swell
the present total to nearly $800 of
the $3,000 quota. Treasurer Franky
Mclnnis submitted a partial report
of Friday's collections which includ
ed contributions from five living
groups and one individual.
They are Branner 2W, $43; Tyler
Hall, $29; Casa Ventura, $52.25; Cass
Adelfa, $85; Roble 3A, $22; and a
donation of $10 from Richard Adloff
In one week, however, Stanford
has failed to fulfill one-third of it>
quota to the drive which ends Fri
day, contrary to an original plan to
close the drive on Saturday. The
change was effected because the
ASSU office has no hours on Sat
urday, giving living groups no op
portunity to turn in money on that
day.
Charmian Kolar, head of the Stan
ford drive, yesterday urged all liv
ing groups to turn in their money
as soon as possible. "We would also
like those who have turned in only
partial contributions to continue
soliciting to try to get 100 per cent
before the drive ends," she added.
In conjunction with the drive for
donations among off-campus stu
dents, Miss Kolar announced yes
terday that a table would be placed
at the P.O. and the English corner
today and Tuesday from 9 to 10 in
the morning and from 12 to 1 for
the purpose of collecting money
from students living off-campus.
Working on the committee with
Miss Kolar and Miss Mclnnis are
Gloria Cassidy, women's collections;
Jack Siemer, men's collections; Beth
van Hoesen, posters; and Georgean
Lightner, window display.
Though not being particularly em
phasized in this drive, there are
countless other ways in which Stan
ford students can directly contribute
to the Red Cross. They include do
nating blood, an urgent need; work
ing for Red Cross motor corps or
as a Red Cross Nurse's Aide; and
donating time to work at a Red Cross
center.
