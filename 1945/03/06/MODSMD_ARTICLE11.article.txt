# FIRST PERSON RESPONSIBILITY
## 
### 
There has been considerable maundering on of late about
"group responsibility" and the Honor Code. Now what people
mean by "responsibility" and "honor" is admittedly difficult
if not altogether* impossible to figure out. But in the present
instance the chief problem seems to be the much simpler word
"group."
Apparently, for those who insist that the Honor Code can
not be properly maintained unless tests are taken "in groups,"
there is a difference between the honor and responsibility of
groups and that of individuals. What is that difference?
Now a group is made up of individuals. Either those indi
viduals are "honorable" or they are not, and putting them in
groups would not seem to change that fact, unless . . . Unless
there are those individuals in the group who are not honorable
but who are afraid someone may find it out if they cheat in
public. In which case "group honor" would seem to be a spe
cious and hardly desirable improvement over individual honor.
Or unless the individuals in your group are so crowded to
gether in the examination room that, without shutting their eyes
tight each time they look up to think, they cannot help but see
what the guy just under their elbow is writing. In which case
"group" responsibility may be distinctly less honorable and
more co-operative than individual-alone-atlibe honor.
It would seem, then, practically, to be six of one and half a
dozen of another. Alone, there is no third person responsible
for you, to scare or report you into honor. Also, alone, there is
not nearly the material for dishonor forced upon you. -
To reconsider from the beginning, what do we have an Honor
Code for anyhow? Firstly, for the convenience of students and
professors — and those who would gainsay convenience for
"higher" reasons do not really enjoy the Honor Code. Keeping
students in classrooms while taking tests is clearly an incon
venience to both students and professors unless outweighed by
inconvenience caused to professors by a large increase in cheat
ing when blue-books are taken out.
Is there, then, such an increase in cheating? Admittedly it
might be so (for those forced into honor) but it does not, as a
matter of experience, seem that it is so. Those people who take
tests out are generally more honorable about sticking to time
limits, etc., because they feel more acutely their privilege. Or
haven't you ever taken a test out?
Then, there is the less evident but none the less actual "what
for" of the Honor Code. It is "for" training people in honor, for
teaching them the practical advantages of doing their own work
and being responsible for their own work and not somebody
else's guff. If there is any such educational value in the Honor
Code, it is not, no matter what how many people say, the edu
cation of the third person that counts, but the education of the
first person, the guy that takes the test, alone or sitting on five
other people, the guy with the honor.
What do you want to teach people about honor? That it de
pends on them no matter where they are or that it is something
they're forced into by "groups"? It may be important, though
it's debatable, to teach people to watch other people's honor.
But it's beyond debate that they better learn some of their own
first.—Nancy Tilden
