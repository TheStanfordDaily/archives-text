To the Editor:
The recently voiced objections to
aking examinations from a class
room have set many of us thinking
ibout the value of our Honor Code.
Honor is not something that ran
have a half-wa\ value. We must be
il)le to completely trust people, on
their Honor, or we might as well
iiot trust them al all. Any limiting

qualifications are indications that
oik's honor is really Hot to lie trust
ed all the way.
If the honor of Stanford students
is to be trusted, then there should be
no more objection to one taking a
blue book out of an exam room than
one going out of a room for fresh
air. In both eases the emphasis is
more on the individual than on the
third person responsibility: for in
each instance, one could no to his

room or the library to look up in
formation.
We do not want to graduate with
a Stanford diploma which has the
stigma of the proctor system. But,
even less do we want to have diplo
mas which hypocritically sail under
the pretences of an honor code
which, in reality, found students and
faculty unable to trust each other
all of the way!
If we cannot trust each other, and
ourselves, let us be realistic and not
pretend to work under an honor
code. But if we have come to such
a state that we need proctors, it
would he better that our courses
were devoted to character lessons
rather than science, history, or law.
Furthermore, who will proctor us
when we have graduated from Stan
ford? Who will be around to see that
we do not take out the "blue books"
and cheat at home? The only proctor
•I will have is myself! The only proc
tor you will have is yourself. Let
us learn now, if we haven't already,
to be our own proctors; and let us
be trusted, on our honor, as our own
proctors both in the classroom and
out. Then, and then only, will the
Honor Code of which we boast with
pride, have a worthy meaning.
