# GROUP RESPONSIBILITY
## 
### 
The Editor:
On March 2 you wrote an editorial
condemning the Honor Code Stand
ing Co m m ittee's recommendation
that examinations not be taken from
the classrooms. Such is your privi
lege, and we are glad to see it
exercised; because it will stir up
needed discussion; honest discussion
on any phase of the Honor Code is
always valuable.
You said, however, that "the in
| significance of these reasons (ad
vanced in support of the recommen
dation) is pitiful." In the interests of
i honest discussion and in presenting
j the other side of the recominenda
| lion, those reasons should he pre
! sented more fully.
"The Honor Code is an under
| taking of the students, individually
I and collectively"; this is the very
j wording of the Code. Group re
sponsibility is not a new creation,
[ being foisted off on an unsuspecting
| student body for the first time.
You would say, if logically in
clined, that individual and group
responsibility arc inconsistent, one
with the other. This they are not.
The premise that evtry student at
Stanford is honest is admittedly un
realistic; an argument for individual
responsibility based on it will be
equally Unrealistic. AM but very
few arc honest; of this we have no
doubt. Such students should have
no objection to taking examinations
in the room Willi fellow students,
with those best knowing of their
honesty and best in a position to
be sure — provided there is adequate
policy for it.
And there is such a policy; the
"single rotten apple" argument is
especially good here. Suspicion of
unpunished cheating in any group
will become a destroying mildew.
Proctoring, to an honest man is in
tolerable; we at Stanford realize
this. Yet who can blame an instruc
tor for wishing to proctor when
rumors come to him that "there's
lots of cheating going on" in his
class? And the same rumor will
create tension and rumor-mongering
within the class to such a degree as
to be ruinous to work and classroom
efficiency. When someone cheats,
there must be an instant mobiliza
tion of sentiment, a loud and im
mediate insistence upon a hearing
before Council; otherwise the Code
is not working. And this mobiliza
tion cannot be really sure, in the
Committee's opinion, when exami
nations are absolutely free to be
taken from the room.
The Code itself says, ". . . that
they (the students) will do their
share and take an active part, in
seeing to it thai others, as well as
themselves, obey the spirit and the
letter of the Honor Code." This is
the so-called (and mis-named) |
"third-person responsibility"; is ii i
"a sacking 61 individual responsi- j
hilityli so. it was "sacked" when j
the Honor Code was adopted.
