# GROUP RESPONSIBILITY
## 
### 
The Editor:
On March 2 you wrote an editorial
condemning the Honor Code Stand
ing Co m m ittee's recommendation
that examinations not be taken from
the classrooms. Such is your privi
lege, and we are glad to see it
exercised; because it will stir up
needed discussion; honest discussion
on any phase of the Honor Code is
always valuable.
You said, however, that "the in
| significance of these reasons (ad
vanced in support of the recommen
dation) is pitiful." In the interests of
i honest discussion and in presenting
j the other side of the recominenda
| lion, those reasons should he pre
! sented more fully.
"The Honor Code is an under
| taking of the students, individually
I and collectively"; this is the very
j wording of the Code. Group re
sponsibility is not a new creation,
[ being foisted off on an unsuspecting
| student body for the first time.
You would say, if logically in
clined, that individual and group
responsibility arc inconsistent, one
with the other. This they are not.
The premise that evtry student at
Stanford is honest is admittedly un
realistic; an argument for individual
responsibility based on it will be
equally Unrealistic. AM but very
few arc honest; of this we have no
doubt. Such students should have
no objection to taking examinations
in the room Willi fellow students,
with those best knowing of their
honesty and best in a position to
be sure — provided there is adequate
policy for it.
And there is such a policy; the
"single rotten apple" argument is
especially good here. Suspicion of
unpunished cheating in any group
will become a destroying mildew.
Proctoring, to an honest man is in
tolerable; we at Stanford realize
this. Yet who can blame an instruc
tor for wishing to proctor when
rumors come to him that "there's
lots of cheating going on" in his
class? And the same rumor will
create tension and rumor-mongering
within the class to such a degree as
to be ruinous to work and classroom
efficiency. When someone cheats,
there must be an instant mobiliza
tion of sentiment, a loud and im
mediate insistence upon a hearing
before Council; otherwise the Code
is not working. And this mobiliza
tion cannot be really sure, in the
Committee's opinion, when exami
nations are absolutely free to be
taken from the room.
The Code itself says, ". . . that
they (the students) will do their
share and take an active part, in
seeing to it thai others, as well as
themselves, obey the spirit and the
letter of the Honor Code." This is
the so-called (and mis-named) |
"third-person responsibility"; is ii i
"a sacking 61 individual responsi- j
hilityli so. it was "sacked" when j
the Honor Code was adopted.

RED CROSS—GO TO IT!
To the Editor:
Never having been interviewed be
fore, and still having a hangover of
awe of The Daily, there are a million
Red Cross facts I forgot to tell the
poised Young Thing with a pencil,
spearing me for an interview for
your paper, that I thought of next
morning. You know how it is with
an ex?
May I add just one of them.
It's interesting to give to the Red
Cross. Its not just joining something,
though you do that, along with the
porter who put your bags in the sta
tion taxi, and the president who says
Hello to you on Quad. It's not buying
yourself something, like a war-bond.
It's buying a part in almost the only
kind thing people do in war, and
buying yourself a vital share in
history, and its alive and interesting
and vital. Sit out in the sun on any
of those steps I can see from this
high window (except the Law Steps)
and think what you may be buying.
Or stand in the sun (well away from
Quad) with one of those legitimate
cigarettes you got from the Cellar
at dawn (well, practically dawn).
Your money may help buy the
candy those Over-the-Hump flyers
make a Christmas party out of for
Chinese kids, bad for the kids, may
be, but keeping homsick boys —
younger than you—from the Chrit
mas blues. Maybe you'll help send
over the blood plasma for your own
brother, or the man you haven't met
yet that you will marry. You may
be sending around a clubmobile in
that Iran country, where the men
pour water on their tools to make
them cool enough to handle.
Perhaps your cup of coffee will
greet the dazed boys, carrying their
full equipment, just out of the boat
train in a drizzly English dawn. You
may be sending that food-package
that keeps health in a desperate
boy (no older than you,) fenced in
somewhere as no free American
should be. You may be behind that
cable that tells someone stumbling
out of the jungle, dirty and bearded
and taking those last heavy steps he
didn't think he could, that his baby
has come and his wife is doing fine.
Perhaps you bought the Motor Corps

gas that rushed her safely to the
hospital. Perhaps you helped give
an American meal (did you ever
taste English cooking, even in pre
war time?) to a tense kid who has
just spread death over a foreign
city and has the bitter taste in his
soul that Americans have who do
that.
Perhaps you paid part of the small
salary the few professionals get who
keep us volunteers in line, who
implement the work that in war
time keeps alive the decencies of
peace.
Look, my pets, $2 looks big to you,
but its not a ceiling, it's a floor.
There is no ceiling. Nothing of your
small comforts, or your little or
big extras is too much a sacrifice for
your self-respect these days. Add
up your cokes, your movies, your
new dress even, your dinner up the
line, and postpone them. Earn your
gift if you have to. So you can sit I
in Western Civ. and feel you are
making it, not just learning it. So
you can sit over your lab. bottles '
without that restless urge to get i
out and do something real with your |
generation.
So you can go to a tea and meet
a mother who didn't believe her son
was out of Santo Tonias till his |
letter came saying nothing tasted so
good as that Red Cross food he got
for his first free meal, and not he ;
so ashamed of your new hat you
didn't need.
This is good money you are giv- |
ing. It's pure gold. It's bring-em
back-alive money. The whole world
is in this Red Cross giving, but noth
ing the world can give is enough for
those men and women (no older than
you) earning our safe, golden days 1
for us. Go to it!

and think what you may be buying.
Or stand in the sun (well away from
Quad) with one of those legitimate
cigarettes you got from the Cellar
at dawn (well, practically dawn).
Your money may help buy the
candy those Over-the-Hump flyers
make a Christmas party out of for
Chinese kids, bad for the kids, may
be, but keeping homsick boys —
younger than you—from the Chrit
mas blues. Maybe you'll help send
over the blood plasma for your own
brother, or the man you haven't met
yet that you will marry. You may
be sending around a clubmobile in
that Iran country, where the men
pour water on their tools to make
them cool enough to handle.
Perhaps your cup of coffee will
greet the dazed boys, carrying their
full equipment, just out of the boat
train in a drizzly English dawn. You
may be sending that food-package
that keeps health in a desperate
boy (no older than you,) fenced in
somewhere as no free American
should be. You may be behind that
cable that tells someone stumbling
out of the jungle, dirty and bearded
and taking those last heavy steps he
didn't think he could, that his baby
has come and his wife is doing fine.
Perhaps you bought the Motor Corps

gas that rushed her safely to the
hospital. Perhaps you helped give
an American meal (did you ever
taste English cooking, even in pre
war time?) to a tense kid who has
just spread death over a foreign
city and has the bitter taste in his
soul that Americans have who do
that.
Perhaps you paid part of the small
salary the few professionals get who
keep us volunteers in line, who
implement the work that in war
time keeps alive the decencies of
peace.
Look, my pets, $2 looks big to you,
but its not a ceiling, it's a floor.
There is no ceiling. Nothing of your
small comforts, or your little or
big extras is too much a sacrifice for
your self-respect these days. Add
up your cokes, your movies, your
new dress even, your dinner up the
line, and postpone them. Earn your
gift if you have to. So you can sit I
in Western Civ. and feel you are
making it, not just learning it. So
you can sit over your lab. bottles '
without that restless urge to get i
out and do something real with your |
generation.
So you can go to a tea and meet
a mother who didn't believe her son
was out of Santo Tonias till his |
letter came saying nothing tasted so
good as that Red Cross food he got
for his first free meal, and not he ;
so ashamed of your new hat you
didn't need.
This is good money you are giv- |
ing. It's pure gold. It's bring-em
back-alive money. The whole world
is in this Red Cross giving, but noth
ing the world can give is enough for
those men and women (no older than
you) earning our safe, golden days 1
for us. Go to it!

On March 2 you wrote an editorial
condemning the Honor Code Stand
ing Co m m ittee's recommendation
that examinations not be taken from
the classrooms. Such is your privi
lege, and we are glad to see it
exercised; because it will stir up
needed discussion; honest discussion
on any phase of the Honor Code is
always valuable.
You said, however, that "the in
| significance of these reasons (ad
vanced in support of the recommen
dation) is pitiful." In the interests of
i honest discussion and in presenting
j the other side of the recominenda

"The Honor Code is an under

I and collectively"; this is the very
j wording of the Code. Group re
sponsibility is not a new creation,
[ being foisted off on an unsuspecting
| student body for the first time.
You would say, if logically in
clined, that individual and group
responsibility arc inconsistent, one
with the other. This they are not.
The premise that evtry student at
Stanford is honest is admittedly un
realistic; an argument for individual
responsibility based on it will be
equally Unrealistic. AM but very
few arc honest; of this we have no
doubt. Such students should have
no objection to taking examinations
in the room Willi fellow students,
with those best knowing of their
honesty and best in a position to
be sure — provided there is adequate
policy for it.
And there is such a policy; the
"single rotten apple" argument is
especially good here. Suspicion of
unpunished cheating in any group
will become a destroying mildew.
Proctoring, to an honest man is in
tolerable; we at Stanford realize
this. Yet who can blame an instruc
tor for wishing to proctor when
rumors come to him that "there's
lots of cheating going on" in his
class? And the same rumor will
create tension and rumor-mongering
within the class to such a degree as
to be ruinous to work and classroom
efficiency. When someone cheats,
there must be an instant mobiliza
tion of sentiment, a loud and im
mediate insistence upon a hearing
before Council; otherwise the Code
is not working. And this mobiliza
tion cannot be really sure, in the

The Code itself says, ". . . that

RED CROSS—GO TO IT!
To the Editor:
Never having been interviewed be
fore, and still having a hangover of
awe of The Daily, there are a million
Red Cross facts I forgot to tell the
poised Young Thing with a pencil,

your paper, that I thought of next

May I add just one of them.
It's interesting to give to the Red
Cross. Its not just joining something,
though you do that, along with the
porter who put your bags in the sta
tion taxi, and the president who says
Hello to you on Quad. It's not buying
yourself something, like a war-bond.
It's buying a part in almost the only
kind thing people do in war, and
buying yourself a vital share in
history, and its alive and interesting

RED CROSS—GO TO IT!
To the Editor:
Never having been interviewed be
fore, and still having a hangover of
awe of The Daily, there are a million
Red Cross facts I forgot to tell the
poised Young Thing with a pencil,
spearing me for an interview for
your paper, that I thought of next
morning. You know how it is with
an ex?
May I add just one of them.
It's interesting to give to the Red
Cross. Its not just joining something,
though you do that, along with the
porter who put your bags in the sta
tion taxi, and the president who says
Hello to you on Quad. It's not buying
yourself something, like a war-bond.
It's buying a part in almost the only
kind thing people do in war, and
buying yourself a vital share in
history, and its alive and interesting
and vital. Sit out in the sun on any
of those steps I can see from this
high window (except the Law Steps)
and think what you may be buying.
Or stand in the sun (well away from
Quad) with one of those legitimate
cigarettes you got from the Cellar
at dawn (well, practically dawn).
Your money may help buy the
candy those Over-the-Hump flyers
make a Christmas party out of for
Chinese kids, bad for the kids, may
be, but keeping homsick boys —
younger than you—from the Chrit
mas blues. Maybe you'll help send
over the blood plasma for your own
brother, or the man you haven't met
yet that you will marry. You may
be sending around a clubmobile in
that Iran country, where the men
pour water on their tools to make
them cool enough to handle.
Perhaps your cup of coffee will
greet the dazed boys, carrying their
full equipment, just out of the boat
train in a drizzly English dawn. You
may be sending that food-package
that keeps health in a desperate
boy (no older than you,) fenced in
somewhere as no free American
should be. You may be behind that
cable that tells someone stumbling
out of the jungle, dirty and bearded
and taking those last heavy steps he
didn't think he could, that his baby
has come and his wife is doing fine.
Perhaps you bought the Motor Corps

gas that rushed her safely to the
hospital. Perhaps you helped give
an American meal (did you ever
taste English cooking, even in pre
war time?) to a tense kid who has
just spread death over a foreign
city and has the bitter taste in his
soul that Americans have who do
that.
Perhaps you paid part of the small
salary the few professionals get who
keep us volunteers in line, who
implement the work that in war
time keeps alive the decencies of
peace.
Look, my pets, $2 looks big to you,
but its not a ceiling, it's a floor.
There is no ceiling. Nothing of your
small comforts, or your little or
big extras is too much a sacrifice for
your self-respect these days. Add
up your cokes, your movies, your
new dress even, your dinner up the
line, and postpone them. Earn your
gift if you have to. So you can sit I
in Western Civ. and feel you are
making it, not just learning it. So
you can sit over your lab. bottles '
without that restless urge to get i
out and do something real with your |
generation.
So you can go to a tea and meet
a mother who didn't believe her son
was out of Santo Tonias till his |
letter came saying nothing tasted so
good as that Red Cross food he got
for his first free meal, and not he ;
so ashamed of your new hat you
didn't need.
This is good money you are giv- |
ing. It's pure gold. It's bring-em
back-alive money. The whole world
is in this Red Cross giving, but noth
ing the world can give is enough for
those men and women (no older than
you) earning our safe, golden days 1
for us. Go to it!

greet the dazed boys, carrying their
full equipment, just out of the boat
train in a drizzly English dawn. You
may be sending that food-package
that keeps health in a desperate
boy (no older than you,) fenced in
somewhere as no free American
should be. You may be behind that
cable that tells someone stumbling
out of the jungle, dirty and bearded
and taking those last heavy steps he
didn't think he could, that his baby
has come and his wife is doing fine.
Perhaps you bought the Motor Corps

gas that rushed her safely to the
hospital. Perhaps you helped give
an American meal (did you ever
taste English cooking, even in pre
war time?) to a tense kid who has
just spread death over a foreign
city and has the bitter taste in his
soul that Americans have who do
that.
Perhaps you paid part of the small
salary the few professionals get who
keep us volunteers in line, who
implement the work that in war
time keeps alive the decencies of
peace.
Look, my pets, $2 looks big to you,
but its not a ceiling, it's a floor.
There is no ceiling. Nothing of your
small comforts, or your little or
big extras is too much a sacrifice for
your self-respect these days. Add
up your cokes, your movies, your
new dress even, your dinner up the
line, and postpone them. Earn your
gift if you have to. So you can sit I
in Western Civ. and feel you are
making it, not just learning it. So
you can sit over your lab. bottles '
without that restless urge to get i
out and do something real with your |
generation.
So you can go to a tea and meet
a mother who didn't believe her son
was out of Santo Tonias till his |
letter came saying nothing tasted so
good as that Red Cross food he got
for his first free meal, and not he ;
so ashamed of your new hat you
didn't need.
This is good money you are giv- |
ing. It's pure gold. It's bring-em
back-alive money. The whole world
is in this Red Cross giving, but noth
ing the world can give is enough for
those men and women (no older than
you) earning our safe, golden days 1
for us. Go to it!

The Editor:
On March 2 you wrote an editorial
condemning the Honor Code Stand
ing Co m m ittee's recommendation
that examinations not be taken from
the classrooms. Such is your privi
lege, and we are glad to see it
exercised; because it will stir up
needed discussion; honest discussion
on any phase of the Honor Code is
always valuable.
You said, however, that "the in
| significance of these reasons (ad
vanced in support of the recommen
dation) is pitiful." In the interests of
i honest discussion and in presenting
j the other side of the recominenda
| lion, those reasons should he pre
! sented more fully.
"The Honor Code is an under
| taking of the students, individually
I and collectively"; this is the very
j wording of the Code. Group re
sponsibility is not a new creation,
[ being foisted off on an unsuspecting
| student body for the first time.
You would say, if logically in
clined, that individual and group
responsibility arc inconsistent, one
with the other. This they are not.
The premise that evtry student at
Stanford is honest is admittedly un
realistic; an argument for individual
responsibility based on it will be
equally Unrealistic. AM but very
few arc honest; of this we have no
doubt. Such students should have
no objection to taking examinations
in the room Willi fellow students,
with those best knowing of their
honesty and best in a position to
be sure — provided there is adequate
policy for it.
And there is such a policy; the
"single rotten apple" argument is
especially good here. Suspicion of
unpunished cheating in any group
will become a destroying mildew.
Proctoring, to an honest man is in
tolerable; we at Stanford realize
this. Yet who can blame an instruc
tor for wishing to proctor when
rumors come to him that "there's
lots of cheating going on" in his
class? And the same rumor will
create tension and rumor-mongering
within the class to such a degree as
to be ruinous to work and classroom
efficiency. When someone cheats,
there must be an instant mobiliza
tion of sentiment, a loud and im
mediate insistence upon a hearing
before Council; otherwise the Code
is not working. And this mobiliza
tion cannot be really sure, in the
Committee's opinion, when exami
nations are absolutely free to be
taken from the room.
The Code itself says, ". . . that
they (the students) will do their
share and take an active part, in
seeing to it thai others, as well as
themselves, obey the spirit and the
letter of the Honor Code." This is
the so-called (and mis-named) |
"third-person responsibility"; is ii i
"a sacking 61 individual responsi- j
hilityli so. it was "sacked" when j
the Honor Code was adopted.

RED CROSS—GO TO IT!
To the Editor:
Never having been interviewed be
fore, and still having a hangover of
awe of The Daily, there are a million
Red Cross facts I forgot to tell the
poised Young Thing with a pencil,
spearing me for an interview for
your paper, that I thought of next
morning. You know how it is with
an ex?
May I add just one of them.
It's interesting to give to the Red
Cross. Its not just joining something,
though you do that, along with the
porter who put your bags in the sta
tion taxi, and the president who says
Hello to you on Quad. It's not buying
yourself something, like a war-bond.
It's buying a part in almost the only
kind thing people do in war, and
buying yourself a vital share in
history, and its alive and interesting
and vital. Sit out in the sun on any
of those steps I can see from this
high window (except the Law Steps)
and think what you may be buying.
Or stand in the sun (well away from
Quad) with one of those legitimate
cigarettes you got from the Cellar
at dawn (well, practically dawn).
Your money may help buy the
candy those Over-the-Hump flyers
make a Christmas party out of for
Chinese kids, bad for the kids, may
be, but keeping homsick boys —
younger than you—from the Chrit
mas blues. Maybe you'll help send
over the blood plasma for your own
brother, or the man you haven't met
yet that you will marry. You may
be sending around a clubmobile in
that Iran country, where the men
pour water on their tools to make
them cool enough to handle.
Perhaps your cup of coffee will
greet the dazed boys, carrying their
full equipment, just out of the boat
train in a drizzly English dawn. You
may be sending that food-package
that keeps health in a desperate
boy (no older than you,) fenced in
somewhere as no free American
should be. You may be behind that

out of the jungle, dirty and bearded
and taking those last heavy steps he
