# Roble League Minis Tonight
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
Roble League squads clash for the
last times tonight in the close of
what has been a very successful in
tra-mural season for them. No cru
cial contests are to take place, but
the boys would like to see a good
crowd for their outing.
The best game to watch will un
doubtedly be the Buchanan-Phi P.si
tussle. Although they have not been
too successful in their season, the
r'Benrcats" showed great promise in
their 20-18 loss to the powerful Betas
last Tuesday. Captained by Bill
Gumbiner, the quintet includes Hoff
man, Christy, McClung, and Silber
man, all being potential scoring
threats.
Our choice, nowever, goes to the
Phi Psi aggregation, which, despite
last week's loss to the Cougar squad,
is still one of the best teams in
either league. Their talented roster
includes: Luke Pitts, Tom Hood, Tom
Ashley, Dick Marquette, Bob Nes
bit, and Dick Crane. This team, al
though slow in starting, can definite
ly count on their front line of Hood,
Pitts, and Ashley to bring them
through.
The greatest walkaway will prob
ably be the Royal Flush-Sequoia
game. The "Roughs" have looked
miserable in all their games, but
they are always in there trying, and
always show up at all their sched
uled tilts.
