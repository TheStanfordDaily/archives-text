# Seniors Plan 'Their Week'
## 
### 
Plans for a Senior Ball, Class Day
and Commencement Day programs
were the important topics of the
senior meeting last night conducted
by B. J. Calfee and Barbara Bur
roughs.
Dr. Hubert Heffner, chairman of
Commencement Exercises, spoke on
the peculiar significance of this year's
graduation as the 50th anniversary
of the class of '95, Stanford's pioneer
class which will join us at a reunion
on Class Day.
'"We owe it to the senior class
members who are fighting overseas
to maintain this year's graduation
exercises in full Stanford spirit," said j
Dr. Heffner.
The class voted to have the Senior i
Ball Saturday night of Senior Week
with a breakfast afterwards. An or
chestra and charms for the girls
would make it similiar to the pre
war Senior Balls.
Miss Calfee asked all seniors to
put in requests at the Bookstore this
week for graduation announcements
and also for the Senior booklets at
a $1 apiece.
Miss Burroughs asked that seniors
the scroll in the ASSU office
before they graduate.
