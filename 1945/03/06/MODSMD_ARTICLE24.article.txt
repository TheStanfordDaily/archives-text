# All-Important Spiritual Problem Solution 'Faith,' Says Trueblood Article
## 
### 
"The Desperate Need for Faith"
is the title of an article by Dr. D.
Elton Trueblood, Stanford Univer
sity chaplain and professor of the
philosophy of religion, which appears
in the March issue of The Readers
Digest.
The article is a condensation of
Dr. Truehlood's most recent book,
"The Predicament of Modern Man,"
published last fall.
In the article the Stanford chaplain
pleads for "the discovery of a suf
ficient faith, something that can set
our souls on fire," as the only solu
tion to the "most urgent problem
of our time—the spiritual problem."
He suggests that the church—with
its four great testimonies of equality
before God, influence for peace, uni
versality, and renunciation of
worldly pride—is" the only hope for
the reconstruction of "our sick civili
zation."
A renewed faith in the Christian
religion which produced the ethic of
the Western world with its emphasis
upon liberty, humanity, equality and
the worth of the individual is es
sential if Americans wish to over
come the Nazi challenge. Dr. True
blood asserts. "We have an ethic

without a religion, whereas we are
challenged by millions who have a
religion without an ethic," he says.
"Ours is a cut-flower civilization.
Beautiful as cut flowers may be, they
will eventually die because they are
severed from their sustaining roots.
We are trying to maintain the digni
ty of the individual apart from the
deep faith that every man is made
in God's image."
Admitting that the church has
imperfections, the Stanford chaplain
maintains that it is the only instru
ment by which the Allies may win a
spiritual victory over Nazi paganism.
Through its "great testimonies"
setting forth the equality of men
before God, the determination to
abolish wars, the principle of essen
tial oneness of all men regardless of
nation and race, and the emphasis
on humble service, the church "may
yet save civilization," Dr. Trueblood
concludes.
Returning in early March to the
Stanford campus after a one-year
sabbatical leave of absence during
which he taught at Garrett Biblical
Institute, Evanston. 111., Dr. True
blood will preach in the Stanford
Memorial Church on March 18.
