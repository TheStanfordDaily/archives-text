Power-mad Heroine
The play concerns the power
greedy Regina played by Sally
Stocker. It is the story of the new
industrial class of the South about
1900. The Hubbard family is after
the good material things of life and
doesn't care whether it ruins other
people in getting them or not.

"The Little Foxes" was first pre
sented in the National Theater in
New York on February 15. 1939.
under the direction of Herman
Shumlin. The leads were played by
Tallulah Bankhead and Frank Con
roy.
It was later produced in the movies
under the same director. Bette Davis
and Herbert Marshall starred in this
version of it. The rest of the cast
was the same. "Miss Hellman is con
sidered one of the leading American
playwrights, and the leading woman
playwright," Mr. Philbrick said.
Setting Is Victorian
The set of the play follows the
general plan of the New York set.
It will be dominated by a heavy
elaborate Victorian staircase upon
which a great deal of the dramatic
action of the play is centered. Lvn

Shrader, an architectural student,
designed it.
There will be oil lamps, a gas
chandelier, and red plush furniture.
The room is furnished very expen
sively but has little taste, typical
of the rising industrial class of this i
period.
Turn of the Century
Costumes will be done in 1900
style. Skirts are floor-length; plumed
hats, hair-dos with French twists
or knots in the back, and dog col
lars were in style. Men's suits had
narrow trouser legs, and men wore
detachable high collars and cuffs.
I They will wear evening clothes in
j the first act, and from then on, busi
j ness suits.
Some of the costumes have been
donated to the costume committee;
others the committee has rented;
! thev will make over some of them, i
