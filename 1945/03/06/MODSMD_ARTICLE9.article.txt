## 
### 
Women's Conference yesterday passed the 2 a.m. fate leave plan which
will go into effect spring quarter on a trial basis.
The plan provides for five special 2 a.m. leaves per quarter tliat can
be taken in place of any 1:33 floater or Saturday night late leave the stu
dent may have. Minus students and new Lower Division women will re-

â–ºceive two 2 a.m. cultural leaves per
quarter to be taken in the middle
of the week, and three 2 a.m. special
leaves to he substituted for their
Saturday night 1 iTiO's only. No one
else will have cultural leaves.
Special Leaves
The committee recommends that
the special leaves be used exclu
sively for out-of-town dates. They
j will be put on a trial basis so Wom-
I en's Council can observe where the
! leaves are being v.sed and if they
are really needed.
No special permission will be
needed to take a special leave, or a
cultural for new Lower Division
women and minus students. A new
2 a.m. sign-out slip will be provided.
New Nominating Committee Plan
Marylou McClure spoke on Ex
com's plan for Nominating Commit
tee and better student representation
on Excom. The plans have not ac
tually been passed yet; so students
who have ideas or suggestions or.
them are urged to contact Miss Mc-
Clure before Wednesday or go to
Excom meeting Wednesday night.
Excom's plan provides for a nomi
nating committee to function in the
nomination of officers for women's
offices only. These offices would in
clude the president and vice-presi
dent of Women's Conference; ASSU
vice-president; and offices of Wom
en's Council. The committee would
meet from 2 to 5 p.m. on the Wednes
day before election week to hear
interviews and nominate women for
offices. They would do no last-min
ute nominating.
Excom has also proposed having
I representatives elected on the basis
j of area (living groups) rather than
classes.
