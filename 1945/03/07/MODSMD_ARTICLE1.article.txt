## 
### 
In a room crowded with women
from small and large living groups,
Stanford's Housing Committee yes
terday heard a plan presented by
B. J. Calfee that combined the pref-
list and the lot system for
living unit or room assignment.
Alter a summary by Sally Breuner,
committee chairman, of previous
discussions, the group considered and
debated the new plan which in
cludes:
1. Meeting and entertainment of
all new women by all living units
throughout fall and winter quarters.
2. Publication of a list of vacancies
in each unit, and drawing, at the end
of winter quarter, for a numbered
card on which women would desig
nate their preference for either large
or small living unit. If the number
signed up exceeded the number of
vacancies in either group, women
would receive preference according
to the number they drew.
3. During spring quarter small and
large living groups would become
better acquainted with women who
signed up for their section.
4. Drawing by new women of an
other card (number unknown to
the girl) on which they would list
their living group preferences, in
order; and submission by the living
unit of a list of girls that could, in
its opinion, best fit congenially into
the group. Submission of another
list by the unit equal to perhaps
three times the number of vacancies
that includes women who also would
fit into the group.
5. Matching of preference lists by
a central administrative committee.
A girl whose name does not appear
on any living unit list will be auto
matically absorbed into the unit
having vacancies, according to her
preference as closely as possible.
Miss Calfee stated that the plan
would be a basis for the congeniality
and fairness because both living unit
and the girl is allowed to express
their wishes.
Objecting to the submission of a
list of names by the living unit mem
bers of the committee and the audi
ence stated that the plan would mean
an extension of rushing to the whole
campus; that a house list is not need
ed for congeniality; and that the
etfort for congeniality comes after
persons move into a unit.
The meeting ended with a request
by committee members for unbiased
consideration of the housing problem,
without prejudices, to allow the com
mittee to take broad steps and con
sider new plans and ideas that may
make a more satisfactory living plan
for the future.

Housing Committee will meet to
morrow afternoon at 4 in room 2.
Education Building, according to
Chairman Sally Breuner. This will
he the last meeting open to general
discussion from the floor. There
after discussion will he limited to
enable committee members to
make decisions.
