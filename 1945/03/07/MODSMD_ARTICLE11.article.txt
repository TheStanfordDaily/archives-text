# You Can't Legislate Honor
## 
### 
There's a boy somewhere who's wishing he
were a darn sight nearer home and thinking
about the days when he'll be back on Quad.
Maybe he's a little worried about it, not sure
whether college is going to grate wrong against
a couple of years in the service. Maybe he's
afraid there will be changes in Stanford that
will jar his conception of it, or changes in him
that will knock the rooftops from the old easy
street of college life.
But most things will seem small, beside a few
ideals which he and the rest of us have grasped
and held as our most fundamental ties to the
Farm. One of these, the Honor Code, he is not
going to want to find warped by petty limita
tions.
We contend that it is a blunder to place
boundaries on the extent of an Honor Code, for
honor itself is a quality which cannot be sub
jected to such limitations without losing its
strength.
The recommendation of the Honor Code
standing committee to toss overboard the old
and good tradition which allows us to take our
examinations from the classroom, is this type
of a boundary. It makes a concession to dis
trust and "safety first" squeams, weakening our
faith in ourselves and in the basis of the Code,
personal honor. When faith is weak, no system
can exist for long.
Because we believe that all the men and
women who return to Stanford after the war
will want the Honor Code kept intact, we ask
that Executive Committee remember what one
boy would want and vote down the proposal
brought before it by its sub-committee.—N. S.
