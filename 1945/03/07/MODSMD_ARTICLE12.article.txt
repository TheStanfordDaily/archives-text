### Walrus the Carpenter 
AH! FOR MY RED-BETRIMMED ROMPERS
The world I live in is a strange place. It is a pleasant
and perpetual playroom where, freed from oppressing
responsibility and care, I gambol at will. I prance about
in red-betrimmed rompers, a white rose over each
ear. and whistle the merry tunes of "Pinafore." And
I study, oh yes, I study: I major in Boathousing and
I minor in Cactus-Gardening, and in between times
I pass the day most pleasantly with wise and bearded
professors.
THE WAGES OF SIN ARE STUDY
In punishment for the original and interesting sin
perpetrated by a suspecting Adam and a scheming Eve,
at set days each quarter I pass into the hands of the
High Priests and Examiners. As (he innocent Spaniard
faced his Inquisitioner, so I face my fate in silence,
scarce a scream escaping my lips while quizzes are
forced beneath my nails, or when I am forced to swal
low one mid-term after the next.
LOVE. BEAUTY AND ROMANCE
But sin does spice up life, and I find a dullness to
ny existence: my soul is stuffed up with the goodness
»f this prosaic Eden.
A QUEST. BETIMES
Leaving for a time my too contented friends, mooing
ind cooing among themselves like watery-eyed Bacalls

and Bogarts, I resolve, on a quest. Helped into a set of
squeaky but curvaceous armor by a faithful friend, I
mount my prancing steed and peddle off. My friend
perches hopefully on the bar, her feet playing a tune
ful air on the spokes of the front wheel.
WE MEET WITH DANGERS
The first cave we pass is inhabited by a Critic-
Monster, a Bower-Beast with bloodshot eyes and a
sinuous, waving tail. From the safety of the Library
Steps. I hear dull groans and moans as this choleric
beast previews each picture.
Next my courage is tried by the Egregious Editor,
who, under the careful supervision of the Great Gordy,
lives in an airy cage and devours tradition-violators
and lethargic students.
But alas, there is one danger I can never pass: the
Epsteen Egg. Most fearful am I of this War Monster
who lurks in the depths of the Cellar, existing 011 Epsom
Salts and Vinegar.
It is said that he sleeps at night in a gun-carriage,
bedded in with war-maps and odd pages of van Clause
witz, muttering his grisly tale of wars and battles to
the vultures and eagles who come nearby.

It is said that he sleeps at night in a gun-carriage,

witz, muttering his grisly tale of wars and battles to
the vultures and eagles who come nearby.

AH! FOR MY RED-BETRIMMED ROMPERS
The world I live in is a strange place. It is a pleasant
and perpetual playroom where, freed from oppressing
responsibility and care, I gambol at will. I prance about
in red-betrimmed rompers, a white rose over each
ear. and whistle the merry tunes of "Pinafore." And
I study, oh yes, I study: I major in Boathousing and
I minor in Cactus-Gardening, and in between times
I pass the day most pleasantly with wise and bearded
professors.
THE WAGES OF SIN ARE STUDY
In punishment for the original and interesting sin
perpetrated by a suspecting Adam and a scheming Eve,
at set days each quarter I pass into the hands of the
High Priests and Examiners. As (he innocent Spaniard
faced his Inquisitioner, so I face my fate in silence,
scarce a scream escaping my lips while quizzes are
forced beneath my nails, or when I am forced to swal
low one mid-term after the next.
LOVE. BEAUTY AND ROMANCE
But sin does spice up life, and I find a dullness to
ny existence: my soul is stuffed up with the goodness
»f this prosaic Eden.
A QUEST. BETIMES
Leaving for a time my too contented friends, mooing
ind cooing among themselves like watery-eyed Bacalls

and Bogarts, I resolve, on a quest. Helped into a set of
squeaky but curvaceous armor by a faithful friend, I
mount my prancing steed and peddle off. My friend
perches hopefully on the bar, her feet playing a tune
ful air on the spokes of the front wheel.
WE MEET WITH DANGERS
The first cave we pass is inhabited by a Critic-
Monster, a Bower-Beast with bloodshot eyes and a
sinuous, waving tail. From the safety of the Library
Steps. I hear dull groans and moans as this choleric
beast previews each picture.
Next my courage is tried by the Egregious Editor,
who, under the careful supervision of the Great Gordy,
lives in an airy cage and devours tradition-violators
and lethargic students.
But alas, there is one danger I can never pass: the
Epsteen Egg. Most fearful am I of this War Monster
who lurks in the depths of the Cellar, existing 011 Epsom
Salts and Vinegar.
