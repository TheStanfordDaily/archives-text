# Bull Session

### Bv MARY AL SMITH 
AW. CUT IT OUT
As the end of winter quarter nears, the Lake is filling,
the libes are filling, Mr. Jones' hell-box is filling.
Hint: Mr. Jones is the man in The Daily back shop
who. together with the night editor, head copy editor
and Friday night janitor fit round stories into square
holes.
The hell-box receives those last paragraphs of
stories (which just won't fit into the page).
"is" is probably some sort of verb, but undoubtedly
a part of speech.
filling may refer to almost anything except Roble
meals.
So-o-o, with little time remaining and as mass murd
ers are frowned upon by the Fundamental Standard,
here is one way of getting even with the copyreaders,
linotypists, and editors —all of whom have the bad
habit of scrapping important copy.
Emptying the contents of the hell-box we find punch
lines of features, butts, the date of that required meet
ing, bottle openers and the major part of former bull
sessions.
These bits are here resurrected:
"Samba San Jose Tamale, manana Tiajuana salud
naranja; Palo Alto Carmen Miranda roble tequilla. El
Rancho Grande peco yankee-ce," I said simply. "Have
a coke," he translated at length.
QUAD CLOTHES WILL BE WORN
Jean Parker's two heads arc amazingly photogenic.
And what of Dolly Dingle, girl weightlifter? Will
her sunny Santa Clara Valley upbringing and her
natural joie de vie—not to mention her vie de poie—
carry her through this latest crisis? Crisis! I don't know,
etaoinsnafushrdlu
ACORDING TO
On Escondido the little green bus turns left at
Arguello, down Arguello to Serra, left at Serra, down
Serra to Galvez and left on Galvez to Belts.
Can you do the Scheincman Strut, now???
