## THE 						PRICE OF FREEDOM 
### 
•March 2, 1945
To the Editor of The Daily:
To accept the privilege of taking examinations with
out a proctor, a trust GIVEN to us by the faculty and
administration and based on personal honor, and to
refuse the responsibility of seeing that it is not violated
is to turn freedom into license and make a quick end
of democracy.
To interpret the concept of individual responsibility
in the above manner is to defend it as the right to
keep or break the trust, and regardless of our choice
reap the benefits free of charge. This is purely selfish.
When we choose to live by personal honor there is no
giving of responsibility in return for the privilege of
freedom. This is something most Stanford students
chose to do long ago, in systems where they did not
have the freedom that the Honor Code gives.
To personally keep faith with the trust is to do our
selves a favor . . . for in this we grow . . . and the op
portunity to do so is handed to us on a silver platter.
To individually accept the responsibility that it is not
violated by others, is to repay in small part our debt by
seeing that it is preserved for future generations that
they too may benefit.
Thus to label the third person responsibility "group"
as distinguished from "individual" is to make a false
dichotomy by giving a separate existence to a term that
expresses the collective effect of responsible individuals,
and in so doing, to destroy the very idea embodied in
the word.
Therefore to maintain conditions in which this re
sponsibility can function is to preserve the very spirit
of the Honor Code as an institution of freedom in a
self-governing community. To take the attitude of the
author of the editorial is to do what has too frequently
been done in the history of democracy . . . forget that
freedom involves responsibility and then cry when the
privileges are taken away. "The Price of Honor" is
not t»> give up, but to preserve the third person re
sponsibility.
Sincerely,
Yvonne Guilbert
