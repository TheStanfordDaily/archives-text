# Cologne Falls as Yanks Roll On
## 
### 
PARIS, Wednesday, March 7 (UP).
The American First Army yester
day captured the historic city of
Cologne and today Lieutenant Gen
eral George S. Patton's famous Third
Army tanks were racing toward
Coblenz and the Rhine at a mile-an
hour clip.
Late last night the sensational
Third Army drive was reported
within 20 miles of the Rhine after

ripping completely through German
defenses in the northern Moselle
for gains of 32 miles in 30
hours.
Patton's tanks took off from a
point near Gindorf, six miles north
east of Bitburg, and swept up at
least a dozen towns as they rolled
along the broad military highway
toward Coblenz.
Front dispatches said the great
cathedral city of Cologne fell with
hardly a fight to Lieutenant General
Courtney H. Hodge's First Army
troops just 39 hours after the first
Americans penetrated the city at
a.m. Monday. Cologne cost the
Americans only minimum casualties
in the lightning 12-day campaign
which opened February 23.
