GUAM. Wednesday, March 7 (UP)
Three Marine divisions on lwo Is
land opened a general offensive
against bitterly resisting Japanese
forces Tuesday under the most in
tense artillery bombardment of the
campaign, it was announced today,
as the enemy death toll rose to 14,456.
Despite the terrific artillery bar
rage which was augmented by car
rier aircraft and Naval gunfire Japa
nese troops backed against the sea
at the northern end of lwo were
waging desperate resistance, Fleet
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz an
nounces.
The Marines hacked out small local
gains in heavy fighting. The first
crazed Japanese remnants apparent
ly were determined to resist to the
end. The mounting Japanese death
toll now has accounted for three
fourths of the original estimated gar
rison of 20,000.
