# WANTEDâ€”SCRAPBOOKS
## 
### 
An urgent request for 100 scrap
books has come to the Stanford War
Board from the USO. Living groups
are asked to help meet this demand
by calling for unfilled scrapbooks
at the War Board office and making
the completion of the books a co
operative project on their part.
