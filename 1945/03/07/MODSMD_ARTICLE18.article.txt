# Cougars Cop League Title
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
Failure of the Med. I quintet to
show fop the third straight time gave
the ATS Cougars the Roble cham
pionship last night. It was not an
undeserved reward, however, for the
Cougars edged out the Phi Psi's 2(»-
24 and thumped the Betas 25-7 to
win the top spot.
From all indications the Cougar's
opponents for the championship of
the whole 18 team basketball setup
| will be the Legal Eagles of the La
gunita League. The Royal Flush out
fit, a former contender for the Roble
League crown, has been eliminated
because of the participation of an
ineligible player in two of their
games.
In the Pavilion at 7:15, the Phi
Psi eked out a 15-12 victory over
the Buchanan "Bearcats" in a very
dull contest. Although the half-time
score was 12-4 in favor of the Phi
Psi's, the Buchanan boys poured it
on during the last half thanks to
Siihcrman and Hoffman, and knotted
the count at 12 all only to have Hood
and Neshit of the victors sink a
bucket and a free throw to cop the
honors.
High point man was Tom Hood
with eight digits to his credit. Most
of his counters were by close in
pivot shots and break throughs. Sec
ond honors went to Dick Silberman
of the "Bearcats" who made six
points by virtue of some nice long
shots taken from the end of circle.
The late games were both walk
aways. In the gym Sequoia lost its
encounter of the season to a vastly
superior Royal Flush team ;»(i-12.
Solomon was V>t for the victors and
swished through 1(> points to take
high point laurels. Evans, who is
consistently in there for the Army
squad, made 10 digits.
The Arguello Whites won their
last game of the season by the over
. whelming score of 53-7 over the
fOilers.
