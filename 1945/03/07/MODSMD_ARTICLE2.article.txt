## 
### 
Seven additional groups added
their contributions to this year's
Red Cross drive yesterday, bringing
the total to $1,520.80, announced
Treasurer Franky Mclnnis. They are:
Chalet (100 per cent), $5(5; Elm (100
per cent), $24; Klahoya Club (100
per cent), $30; Durand, $32; Branner
1 east, $29; Roble IC, $28.05; Bran
ner IW, $47; and individual contribu
tions from the Cellar and the History
Corner, $64.50.
With three more days of the drive
left, Stanford students have so far
shown only enough energy to con
tribute one half of the $3,000 total
necessary to fill the Farm quota.
Out of 55 contributing groups on
campus, only 28 have yet given any
money at all to this vital organiza
tion.
If every student on campus were
to give the $2 minimum asked, Stan
ford would far overreach this quota,
and he would be doing more than
his part in contributing to the over
all success of the national drive.
