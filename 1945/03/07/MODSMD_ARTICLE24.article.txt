# Seminar Today To Hear Wiggins

### 
"Some Problems in the Search for
Cinchona" will be discussed by Pro
fessor Ira L. Wiggins, of the Biology
(Botany) Department, at the School
of Biological Sciences seminar today
at 4:15 in room 430 ol Jordan Hall.
Professor Wiggins will describe
the difficulty in finding the various
kinds of trees bearing bark from
which quinine may be extracted, the
number of species of these trees, of
which cinchona is one, and the land
and geography where they are found.
Professor Wiggins, who is director
of the Natural History Museum, was
in Ecuador from May to December
of lasf year as a member of a group
of government employes sent to find
out and record the types and num
ber of quinine producing trees. The
group traveled through extremely
rough territory, dense forests, and
high altitudes to find the most useful
trees, describe them and their loca
tion so that the United States might
be able to specify certain require
ments in its orders to Eucador for
quinine.
