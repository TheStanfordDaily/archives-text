# Salvage Collection Held This Saturday
## 
### 
Old magazines and books, clothes
and rags, cardboard, waste paper,
and rubber articles will be collected
this Saturday, March 10 in the sec- j
ond and last of this quarter's salvage
j drives, according to Shirley Jamison,
| chairman of the Salvage Committee.
The Salvation Army truck will
start collecting from the living groups
at 9 a.m. on Saturday. In order that
salvage be easily accessible for the
collectors, chairmen are asked to
put all salvageable material in boxes
and place them in front of their
residences.
Results of the last drive on Febru
ary 10 were very successful, accord
ing to Miss Jamison, and it is hoped
that cooperation in this Saturday's
drive will be as satisfactory.
