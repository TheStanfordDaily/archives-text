# 'Little Foxes' Curtain To Rise at 8:15
## Southern Drama Is Near Sellout 
### 
Curtain will rise at 8:15 p.m. to
night on "The Little Foxes" by Lil
lian Hellman which the Stanford
Players will present for five nights
ending Monday plus a Saturday
matinee in the Little Theater of Me
morial Hall.
Five tickets remain for tonight's
performance; three for tomorrow
night's show; a large number of
tickets for the Saturday matine; and
some for Monday night, according
to Mr. Chester W. Barker, secretary !
of the Speech and Drama Depart
ment.
The drama is the story of the Hub
bard family, members of the new in
dustrial class of the South at the j
turn of the century. The Hubbards
are after the good material things j
of life and don't care whom they ruin J
to get possession of them. Regina, |
the leading character played by Sally |
Stocker, is exceedingly power- j
greedy.
Floor-length skirts, plumed hats,
hair-dos with French twists or knots
in the back, and dog collars were
typical costumes of the women of
1900. Men wore detachable high col
lars and cuffs and four-in-hand ties,
those which have a smaller knot
than those today. Men's suits had
narrow trouser legs.
Miss Betty Wattenberger, costume
director, and members of costumes
classes have made over a large num
ber of the costumes which were
either donated to or rented by the
costume committee.
Ornate Setting
The set of the play, under the di

rection of Mr. John Sollers, will be
dominated by a heavy elaborate Vic
torian staircase upon which much of
the dramatic action of the play is
centered. The furniture will be of
red plush and there will be oil
lamps and a gas chandelier. The room
is furnished very orftately, but with
little taste, typical of the rising in
dustrial class of 1900.
The cast includes: Mary Cogswell
as Addie; Stewart Harrison as Cal;
Barbara Welch as Birdie Hubbard;
Robert Blum as Oscar Hubbard;
Charles Smurr as Leo Hubbard;
Sally Stocker as Regina Giddens;
Martin Nalder as William Marshall;
John High as Benjamin Hubbard:
Mary Lou Patton as Alexandra Gid
dens; and Howard Campbell as
Horace Giddens.
