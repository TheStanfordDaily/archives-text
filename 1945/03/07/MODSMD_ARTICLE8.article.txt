# Telford Work Shows Vacation Film Of California's Trinity Alp Trails
## 
### 
"Trail Packing Through the Trinity Alps" was the subject of Stanford
Medical student Telford Work's film which closed the Tuesday Evening
Series for winter quarter last night. Mr. Work made the film on his last
"civilian vacation" two years ago before joining Naval V-12 to continue
his medical studies.

The Trinity Alp Primitive Area, in
Trinity County of Northern Cali
fornia, was set aside as a national
forest in 1926 by the Forestry De- |
partment of the Department of Agri
culture. One of many primitive areas
in the country, it is being adminis
tered by the Forestry Department
and preserved in its natural state for
the enjoyment of vacationers who
love the out-of-doors atmosphere of
rugged country.
The film followed-Work and his
two companions from the Trinity
Alps Resort over rocky mountain
trails, following the Trinity River
and its tributaries to the most remote
spots of this area.
There are no roads in the Trinity
Alps Primitive Area, and for most
of the journey Work and his friends
had to make their own trails.
On the first leg of the trip, the
group stopped at Van Metre Creek
for some Rainbow trout fishing
where they hooked a 26-inch trout.
This, explained Work, may have
been a good looking fish, but it was
the Eastern Brooks in the lakes
above the river that were better eat
ing. Work invited the audience to j
a real camping breakfast where new- j
ly-caught trout were fried and
served with fried eggs and steaming j
hot coffee. The audience reacted i

quite positively to this scene. Be
sides fishing the group occupied it
self with deer hunting and got a
sizable load for the final trip home.
