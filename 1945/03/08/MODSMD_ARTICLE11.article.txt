# Registrar Discusses GI Return

Editorial note: This is the third in
our series on Stanford's postwar out
look.
"Returning veterans will play a
large part in postwar Stanford," said
Dr. J. P. Mitchell, registrar. Wc al
ready have about 120 veterans, and
every day Stanford receives letters
of inquiry from 15 or 20 servicemen.
They ask for catalogues, enrollment
information, and all about Stanford.
Letters come from camps and hos
pitals all over the world. It will
be a long trip home for many of
those boys, but their letters show
they want a college education when
they get here.
Many of the applicants are former
Stanford students; others have not
yet graduated from high school.
Quite a few were once stationed here
with Army units. Now they want
to return as civilians.
Many veterans are returning to
school under the G.I. Bill of Rights
or the Veterans Rehabilitation Law,
and most will be preparing for a
future job. They seem particularly
interested in the medical and busi
ness scnools.
"Stanford will keep the same
fundamental courses after the war,"
said Dr. Mitchell; "but these courses
will be kept up to date. Chemistry
and Problems of Labor will have
more ground to cover; so will West
ern Civ and numerous other
courses."
The percentage of foreign students
has remained about the same
throughout the war, he said, and it
will probably change little in the
future. The drop in European regis
tration has been offset by increased
applications from South America and
China.
When large groups of men return,
the women will have less housing
space, Dr. Mitchell warned. Unless
a new dormitory is built, fewer wom
en can be accepted in the incoming
classes. But the cutdown will be
gradual, and women already enrolled
do not have to worry. They are part
of the Stanford Family and will be
welcome to stay until they graduate.
