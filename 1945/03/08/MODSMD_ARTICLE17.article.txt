# Girls! Grab a Man In Sadie Hawkins Race
## 
### 
Provided all the men running are
captured in the Sadie Hawkins race
Saturday afternoon, 29 couples will
arrive at the Sadie Hawkins dance
at 8 that evening wearing tattered
clothes, flaunting hillbilly accentsâ€”
and no doubt slightly out of breath.
If not selected for the race, women
still have the privilege of asking men
to take them to the dance, since
Sadie Hawkins day is a 24-hour
version of leap-year, according to
Chairman Milton Levy.
Apparently, however, women are

not getting organized, for only 39
tickets had been sold out of the
hundreds being offered at the ASSU
office for $1.25 apiece.
Matt Mateo's orchestra will replace
the usual recorded dance music; a
bevy of cartooned Li'l Abners and
Daisy Mae's will camouflage the
walls of the Pavilion where the dance
is to be held.
Committee members are as follows:
Publicity, Luke Pitts; decorations.
Anne Armstrong; refreshments, Bill
Reinhardt; and arrangements and
patrons, Jean Richards.
