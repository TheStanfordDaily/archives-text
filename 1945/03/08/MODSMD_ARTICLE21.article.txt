# Stacker, Welch Steal 'Little Foxes' Opening
## 
### 
In a slick, tightly-timed first night
; performance of Lillian Hillman's
i sure-fire "Little Foxes" last night
| the women did it again. Barbara
Welch as "Birdie" and Sally Stocker
as "Regina" walked cleanly off with
the first and third acts respectively
to tie for top honors, as Johnny High
in the person of the wily Ben paced
a smooth well-in-hand second.
Particularly pleasing was the
spirited, if sometimes sporadic, effort
to give a fresh interpretation to
characters well mailed over and set
already by both stage and screen.
Outstanding and refreshing to the
whole in this respect was Stewart
Harrison in the lets-take-timc-out
and-laugh-for-a-minute relief part
of Cal, the earnest Negro servant.
In this respect also the superiority
j of Stocker's last act over the two
I earlier ones seemed a result of set
tling down to one characterization
j of Regina where previously she had
1 wavered unco nvincingly between
I two. She could not seem to make up
her mind whether to play her as
the complete regenerate — at once
strong and a cynic—or a woman not
at first any stronger than her daugh
ter forced by circumstances to great

er and greater strength and damna
tion.
Slockcr Interpretation
This latter interpretation she
seems to settle for in the last act,
emphasizing quietly the lines about
what she had wanted as a child, the
j busyness of her brothers, what she
j would do for Alexandra, ctc. while
High gave just that needed punch
to "the smile that always Rets a
woman farther." All of which made
her earlier difficulty in overcoming
the round-ingenue contours of her
face and spells of apparent weak
ness and concern for those around
her more understandable, had she
stuck to them and not slipped on
occasion into the much more sinister
characterization of Tallulah or Davis
playing Tallulah.
As the latter Stocker has not the
face nor the voice to be convincing,
but as the more uncertain Regina
forced throughout the play to a
slow realization of her own destruc
tive strength, she would have been,
and was in the last act, both con
vincing and original.
Welch
| Barbara Welch, in what was clear-
I lv the most meticulous characterize

tion of the evening, made of Birdie
at once a sympathetic, pathetically
unbalanced, small woman. It is in the
very hurried dreamlike quality of
her voice, in the care with which
she never slips from almost childish
accent.
However in the last act she slows
her lines for tensity, drawing out
and in part spoiling the former feel
ing of tragic hurry and coincidental
ly leaving the rest of the people on
stage with nothing to do but sit tight,
of which the audience becomes con
scious only because the scene has
been ;jo slowed.
Johnny High's best moments arc
his last. The nearer the three of
them come to disaster the better his
characterization fits the action, be
ing that of a fundamentally grim,
not-so-funny man. In fact both he
and his brother and sister are a
trifle too grim, lacking even in sur
face humor, to make the party of the
first act seem actual.
It would seem more reasonable
that they become grim as layers of
suavity are worn off by the tighten
ing noose about them all; and not
conversely that the play become
grim to suit their characterizations.

Robert Blum as Oscar is most
convincing in his efforts to get his
own and his son Horace's share of
the mill, being the rest of the time
a little too stupid to have lasted so
long in the Hubbard machinations.
Honorable Mention
More than honorable mention
should go to Howard Campbell for
handling clearly a more htan diffi
cult Horace Giddens, to Charles
Smurr for a consistent characteriza
tion of a weakling though his women
in Mobile are hard to swallow, and
to Mary Lou Patton for an entirely
believable 17-year-old.
Mary Cogswell as Addie gave her
usual excellent performance, keep
ing her folk-sayings properly quiet
and tired that they might carry all
the more force as symbol for the
play—"There are those who devour
the earth—"
The professional slickness'of di-
I rection, character, action of the
whole would be hard to beat in the
best of old-hand circles and certain
ly would lick the spots off any other
college performance seen by this re-
I viewer in many a long, long day.—

i sure-fire "Little Foxes" last night
| the women did it again. Barbara
Welch as "Birdie" and Sally Stocker
as "Regina" walked cleanly off with
the first and third acts respectively
to tie for top honors, as Johnny High
in the person of the wily Ben paced
a smooth well-in-hand second.
Particularly pleasing was the
spirited, if sometimes sporadic, effort
to give a fresh interpretation to
characters well mailed over and set
already by both stage and screen.
Outstanding and refreshing to the
whole in this respect was Stewart
Harrison in the lets-take-timc-out
and-laugh-for-a-minute relief part
of Cal, the earnest Negro servant.
In this respect also the superiority
j of Stocker's last act over the two
I earlier ones seemed a result of set
tling down to one characterization
j of Regina where previously she had
1 wavered unco nvincingly between
I two. She could not seem to make up
her mind whether to play her as
the complete regenerate — at once
strong and a cynic—or a woman not
at first any stronger than her daugh
ter forced by circumstances to great

er and greater strength and damna
tion.
Slockcr Interpretation
This latter interpretation she
seems to settle for in the last act,
emphasizing quietly the lines about
what she had wanted as a child, the
j busyness of her brothers, what she
j would do for Alexandra, ctc. while
High gave just that needed punch
to "the smile that always Rets a
woman farther." All of which made
her earlier difficulty in overcoming
the round-ingenue contours of her
face and spells of apparent weak
ness and concern for those around
her more understandable, had she
stuck to them and not slipped on
occasion into the much more sinister
characterization of Tallulah or Davis
playing Tallulah.
As the latter Stocker has not the
face nor the voice to be convincing,
but as the more uncertain Regina
forced throughout the play to a
slow realization of her own destruc
tive strength, she would have been,
and was in the last act, both con
vincing and original.
Welch
| Barbara Welch, in what was clear-
I lv the most meticulous characterize

tion of the evening, made of Birdie
at once a sympathetic, pathetically
unbalanced, small woman. It is in the
very hurried dreamlike quality of
her voice, in the care with which
she never slips from almost childish
accent.
However in the last act she slows
her lines for tensity, drawing out
and in part spoiling the former feel
ing of tragic hurry and coincidental
ly leaving the rest of the people on
stage with nothing to do but sit tight,
of which the audience becomes con
scious only because the scene has
been ;jo slowed.
Johnny High's best moments arc
his last. The nearer the three of
them come to disaster the better his
characterization fits the action, be
ing that of a fundamentally grim,
not-so-funny man. In fact both he
and his brother and sister are a
trifle too grim, lacking even in sur
face humor, to make the party of the
first act seem actual.
It would seem more reasonable
that they become grim as layers of
suavity are worn off by the tighten
ing noose about them all; and not
conversely that the play become
grim to suit their characterizations.

Robert Blum as Oscar is most
convincing in his efforts to get his
own and his son Horace's share of
the mill, being the rest of the time
a little too stupid to have lasted so
long in the Hubbard machinations.
Honorable Mention
More than honorable mention
should go to Howard Campbell for
handling clearly a more htan diffi
cult Horace Giddens, to Charles
Smurr for a consistent characteriza
tion of a weakling though his women
in Mobile are hard to swallow, and
to Mary Lou Patton for an entirely
believable 17-year-old.
Mary Cogswell as Addie gave her
usual excellent performance, keep
ing her folk-sayings properly quiet
and tired that they might carry all
the more force as symbol for the
play—"There are those who devour
the earth—"
The professional slickness'of di-
I rection, character, action of the
whole would be hard to beat in the
best of old-hand circles and certain
ly would lick the spots off any other
college performance seen by this re-
I viewer in many a long, long day.—

| the women did it again. Barbara
Welch as "Birdie" and Sally Stocker
as "Regina" walked cleanly off with
the first and third acts respectively
to tie for top honors, as Johnny High
in the person of the wily Ben paced
a smooth well-in-hand second.
Particularly pleasing was the
spirited, if sometimes sporadic, effort
to give a fresh interpretation to
characters well mailed over and set
already by both stage and screen.
Outstanding and refreshing to the
whole in this respect was Stewart
Harrison in the lets-take-timc-out
and-laugh-for-a-minute relief part
of Cal, the earnest Negro servant.
In this respect also the superiority
j of Stocker's last act over the two
I earlier ones seemed a result of set
tling down to one characterization
j of Regina where previously she had
1 wavered unco nvincingly between
I two. She could not seem to make up
her mind whether to play her as
the complete regenerate — at once
strong and a cynic—or a woman not
at first any stronger than her daugh
ter forced by circumstances to great

er and greater strength and damna
tion.
Slockcr Interpretation
This latter interpretation she
seems to settle for in the last act,
emphasizing quietly the lines about
what she had wanted as a child, the
j busyness of her brothers, what she
j would do for Alexandra, ctc. while
High gave just that needed punch
to "the smile that always Rets a
woman farther." All of which made
her earlier difficulty in overcoming
the round-ingenue contours of her
face and spells of apparent weak
ness and concern for those around
her more understandable, had she
stuck to them and not slipped on
occasion into the much more sinister
characterization of Tallulah or Davis
playing Tallulah.
As the latter Stocker has not the
face nor the voice to be convincing,
but as the more uncertain Regina
forced throughout the play to a
slow realization of her own destruc
tive strength, she would have been,
and was in the last act, both con
vincing and original.
Welch
| Barbara Welch, in what was clear-
I lv the most meticulous characterize

tion of the evening, made of Birdie
at once a sympathetic, pathetically
unbalanced, small woman. It is in the
very hurried dreamlike quality of
her voice, in the care with which
she never slips from almost childish
accent.
However in the last act she slows
her lines for tensity, drawing out
and in part spoiling the former feel
ing of tragic hurry and coincidental
ly leaving the rest of the people on
stage with nothing to do but sit tight,
of which the audience becomes con
scious only because the scene has
been ;jo slowed.
Johnny High's best moments arc
his last. The nearer the three of
them come to disaster the better his
characterization fits the action, be
ing that of a fundamentally grim,
not-so-funny man. In fact both he
and his brother and sister are a
trifle too grim, lacking even in sur
face humor, to make the party of the
first act seem actual.
It would seem more reasonable
that they become grim as layers of
suavity are worn off by the tighten
ing noose about them all; and not
conversely that the play become
grim to suit their characterizations.

Robert Blum as Oscar is most
convincing in his efforts to get his
own and his son Horace's share of
the mill, being the rest of the time
a little too stupid to have lasted so
long in the Hubbard machinations.
Honorable Mention
More than honorable mention
should go to Howard Campbell for
handling clearly a more htan diffi
cult Horace Giddens, to Charles
Smurr for a consistent characteriza
tion of a weakling though his women
in Mobile are hard to swallow, and
to Mary Lou Patton for an entirely
believable 17-year-old.
Mary Cogswell as Addie gave her
usual excellent performance, keep
ing her folk-sayings properly quiet
and tired that they might carry all
the more force as symbol for the
play—"There are those who devour
the earth—"
The professional slickness'of di-
I rection, character, action of the
whole would be hard to beat in the
best of old-hand circles and certain
ly would lick the spots off any other
college performance seen by this re-
I viewer in many a long, long day.—
