LONDON, March 7 (UP). â€”The
Red Army went within 12 miles of
Stettin Wednesday and captured two
big forts in the Danzig outer defense
belt, while the German radio re
ported that the Russians had stabbed
to within 29 miles of Berlin in new
attacks along a 40-mile Oder front.
Berlin spoke of the Oder drive as
possibly the beginning of a knock
out offensive against the Reich cap
ital but no confirmation came from
Moscow.
More than 250 towns of Pomerania
and old Polish territory fell as the
First and Second White Russian ar
mies flashed through disjointed
German defenses for gains up to 13
miles on a Baltic front stretching 160
airline miles on the Stettin bay to
the Danzig area.
Marshal Joseph Stalin issued two
orders of the day Wednesday to an
nounce the Baltic successes. The
Germans for the second successive
day hurled heavy forces against the
Soviet line northwest of Budapest
striving to throw the Russians back
to the Danube.
