# Excom Discusses Honor Code; Plans Panel Discussions
## 
### 
Agenda of last night's Executive
Committee meeting was as follows:
1. Discussion of Honor Code Stand
ing Committee's recommendation.
2. Representation on Excom.
3. Elections and Nominations.
4. Senior Dance.
The committee failed to take ac
tion on the proposed recommenda
tion of the Honor Code Standing
Committee, but planned for a stu
dent-faculty panel discussion of the
matter at an early date next quar
ter.
A student presented to the com
mittee a petition of student signa
tures opposed to the recommendation
to take exams in the room.
Emphasizing the importance of in
dividual responsibility to the Code
above collective or third-person re
sponsibility, the opinion of Excom
on the issue of taking examinations
from classrooms nevertheless seemed
to be that third-person responsibility
as represented by the presence of
other students during an examina
tion was a vital portion of the Code
and one which has kept it on a prac
tical and workable basis.
The recommendation was made
to clarify issues where professors
denied to students the privilege of
taking examinations from rooms
and used the contrary action of
the student as a basis for turning
him in for violation of the Code.
Suggestion was made that passing
of such a measure was outside the
jurisdiction of Excom, since the
Code was initiated by students. Bar
bara White said faculty members she
has interviewed believe as a whole
that the recommendation is "a wise
move."
A referendum on th*e constitu
tional change of Excom representa
tion from a class to living-group
basis will be held the second Tues
day after registration next quarter,
according to Excom's resolution.
The senior class requested exten
sion of the $500 limit on bands for
its Ball, but the question was left
unanswered until next week to allow
for discussion.
