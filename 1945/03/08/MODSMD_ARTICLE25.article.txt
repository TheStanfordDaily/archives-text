# German Infantry Captives Dazed
## 
### 
PARIS, March 7 (UP).â€”Patten's
armored forces were close to a junc
ture with the U.S. First Army, which
had trapped thousands of Germans
and countless enemy supplies be
tween the two armies.
The First Army, conqueror of Co
logne, was closing in on Bonn and
Patten's army was ready to storm
Coblenz.
Both armies have been operating
under a news blackout and the ex
act point on the Rhine reached by
Patten was not revealed immedi
ately.
Early last night he was reported
to be within 10 miles of Coblenz but
that was before it was announced
that his army had reached the Rhine.
Front dispatches said Patten's forces
went through town after town in its
race for the Rhine, and that thou
sands of dazed German prisoners
were left behind.
The German infantry quit cold,
U.S. correspondents reported, and
Patten's men never bothered to
guard the captives along the high
ways with their hands on their
heads.
Many burnt-out enemy tanks also
dotted the highways as Patten's tanks
rolled on unchecked.
It was a typical Patten advance,
with his armor running away from
his supply trucks. Front dispatches
described the drive as one of the
most daring maneuvers in the his
tory of armored warfare.
