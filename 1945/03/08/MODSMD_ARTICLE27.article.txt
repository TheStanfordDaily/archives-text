# Escape of General Enrages Fascists
## 
### 
ROME, March 7 (UP). â€” Guarded
by tanks and hundreds of police,
the cabinet met twice today in an
effort to calm a tense political situ
ation resulting from the escape of
General Mario Roatto while on trial
as a war criminal.
Demonstrations at which two per
sons were killed and at least seven
wounded continued throughout the
night in protest against what was
termed the government's laxity in
permitting Roatto to escape Sunday
night.
