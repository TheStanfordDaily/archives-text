# Rising Ohio River Flood Waters Raise Deaths
## 
### 
CINCINNATI, March 7 (UP). -

River floods grew hourly tonight
bringing new menace to river towns
whose defenses had held against a
water head that already had over
run millions of acres and made thou
sands homeless. The death toll
climbed to nine in six cities.
