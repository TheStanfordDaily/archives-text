# HOUSING COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Two or three hundred Stanford women can't
be wrong—or right either, as was proved at
Tuesday's mass open meeting of the Housing
Committee when debate raged hot and long
on the proposed plan for women's housing that
included a combination of the preference and
lot systems for living unit or room assignment.
No, Stanford women couldn't agree, but the
meeting showed that more hard, actual think
ing has been done in the past few days on the
heretofore obscure, confused, and ticklish hous
ing problem than ever before.
Tuesday's meeting brought a review of com
mittee objectives: understanding of the com
mon housing problems; working out of a plan
or plans for future housing (to be submitted to
the administration), keeping in mind points
outlined by Dr. Tresidder in a letter to the
committee: maintenance of congeniality of liv
ing groups, through no system that resembles
rushing, and filling of former sorority houses
to their capacities for efficient economic opera
tion.
Previous committee meetings have led to the
expression of a positive opinion on three points:
(1) the discussions should be applied to the
housing problem as a whole, not just to filling
former sorority houses; (2) freshman dormi
tories should be maintained; (3) classes in living
groups should be egually proportioned and
transfers should be absorbed into units indi
vidually.
Under discussion, but hinging on a decision
on an actual system for living unit assignment,
were problems of finances, future independence
of small Union units, and independence of
liouse policy. Positive action was taken by the
group only in the appointment of a sub-com
mittee to work out a social program for next
quarter.
From out of the confused mass of facts, opin
ions, prejudices, and arguments expressed at
previous meetings, and especially at the open
meeting Tuesday, come two primary questions:
1. How fine a distinction must be drawn,
how great a preference must be exercised in
order to develop a congenial group?
2. Will Stanford women be able to continue
living co-operatively and independently in
small units without selecting those with whom
they wish to live?
To the first we say, no preference need be
made, no distinction need be drav/n other than
an insistence on a clear understanding of the
types of living offered in University units. For
small co-operative houses this would mean a
willing acceptance by the woman moving in
of the principles and responsibilities connected
with small living groups. Failure to accept
qroup responsibilities should be grounds for
fpulsion from the living unit We have enough

faith in the women of Stanford to believe that a
lot system will work if both new and old mem
bers of the living unit make an effort toward
congeniality; if both new and old students are
given ample opportunity to meet and to know
each other.
And that answers the second question.
Whether houses may maintain their present
co-operative system depends upon how much
the members of those houses want to main
tain that system. With a rejection, on both
sides, of bitterness and prejudice, women in
small and in large living groups have a great
and important opportunity to learn and to ex
change, or improve that which is best in both
living systems.—H. D.
