### Walrus the Carpenter THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER 
To the Walrus:
Dear Sir:
The breadth of interest and the depth of understand
ing that you have displayed so consistently throughout
the quarter must serve as my excuse for addressing
the following remarks to you, in the hope that you will
give them further circulation in your column.
Some time ago you betrayed a lack of sympathy with
the prewar activities of fraternities on the campus
and advocated, through the medium of John Bell, not
only that they be abolished but that all undergraduate
students go with them. Is not that to be in some danger
of throwing out the baby with the bath-water?
Sir, I recognize in your temperament a certain Swift
ian impatience with the human race. It is understand
able in a Walrus. But if it be not corrected it will lesson
your power of effecting reforms.
Undergraduates seem to be as permanent a part of
the University as the grounds itself and it would be
wiser to recognize the situation than to wear yourself
out and weary your readers to no purpose. My own
observations are that undergraduates, like any group
of barbarians at the same cultural level, can be in
fluenced by an appeal to a selfish end. It is, of course,
useless, at that stage, to base any appeal on public
good or morality.
Nevertheless it should be possible to persuade them
to better action either by the inducement of a reward
or the fear of punishment. A man does not pass out
of his childhood abruptly.
If parental controls are too suddenly relaxed the
raw youth, untrained in the responsibilities of adult
life, will behave in just that manner the observation
of which has given you just cause for despair.
But while it is no longer possible to pacify him with
the promise of a spoonful of jam, or intimidate him
with the threat of a thrashing, the same purposes can
be gained by other methods. Let us offer grade credits
for good conduct and, when necessary, let us punish
by the curtailment of liberty and ease that have not
been earned.
By sterner disciplines and by a series of rewards,
both carefully graded so as to diminish in frequency
as the young man acquires more self-control, it may
yet be possible to save the Universities without abolish
ing the students.
Sincerely yours,
Mr. Smith,
Resident Assistant at Tyler Hall

by the curtailment of liberty and ease that have not
been earned.
By sterner disciplines and by a series of rewards,
both carefully graded so as to diminish in frequency
as the young man acquires more self-control, it may
yet be possible to save the Universities without abolish
ing the students.
Sincerely yours,
Mr. Smith,
Resident Assistant at Tyler Hall
