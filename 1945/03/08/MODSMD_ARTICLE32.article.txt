WITHOUT ILLUSION
Dear Editor:
In a roundabout way I have received your excellent
editorial and report on Dr. van Walt's lecture as of
February 23. Tine doctor is not far from the truth in
what he says about our enemy. We should have no
illusions about the German people, they have been
nurtured for brutality and atrocity against other peo
ple for generations. To this must be added their utter
servility to authority, which has become part of their
soul.
Heinrich Heine, a hundred years ago said: '"The Ger
man is like a slave who obeys his master, without
chains, without a whip, but at a mere word, even at
a glance. Servility is his nature. Worse than material
slavery is that of his spirit." This condition makes him
an easy tool for the General Staff. When he is ordered
to commit an atrocity like the killing off of the male
population of 1,200 at Littice; exterminating hundreds
of thousands prisoners, including women and children
in the Majdanek camp, Poland, he does it without com
punction, because the General Staff wills it.
Now when Germany is on the brink of collapse he
disowns these atrocities as he, in his servility, has
carried out only orders. It was the same after World
War I. when he couldn't understand why he was hated
by the world for his atrocities as he had only carried
out orders from headquarters.
Let us look at history at the acts of conquests and
subjugation of its neighbors, for the past 80 years:
In 1864 came the invasion of Denmark and Germany
walked off with the loot of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1866
Austria was invaded and made it a satellite. In 1870
came the invasion of France through Bismarck forging
a telegram from Napoleon 111, thereby deceiving the
German people. The Germans remained in possession
of Paris until an indemnity of $1,000,000 cash was paid
and Alsace and Lorraine was ceded to them. That sum
was considered enormous, but the French people sold
all of their foreign securities and paid the money, to
the chagrin of Bismarck who had fondly hoped that
the French would be unable to raise the money and
they would be subjugated for ever.
In 1914 came another invasion of France that was
calamitous for Germany, but not as much as it should
have been, as Woodrow Wilson prevented the Allies
from taking Berlin which the Germans considered
weakness by the Americans, and encouraged the Ger
mans to start War 11.
Instead of giving any sympathy whatever to the
German people, it should be extended to the living
relatives of those gallant Stanford students who were
pushed into World War I and gave their lives for the
false slogan: "To make the world safe for democracy."
For these patriots is now a tablet on the Stanford cam
pus. Before long there will be another tablet erected
on the University ground giving the names of those fine
Stanford men who sacrificed their lives to prevent
German domination of the world.
