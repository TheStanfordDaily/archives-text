Dear Editor:
For some time I have been concerned with a matter
regarding our Honor Code. Each examination sheet
or book requires a signature which certifies that Ihe
rules for honorable conduct have been observed.
Why must we re-assert our fidelity to the Honor
Code ideal when we have pledged ourselves to uphold
it on Registration day ? Could it be that honor fluc
tuates?
Having to sign the honor pled"e on every exam is
worse to me than having someone stand over me with
a yardstick.
Sincerely,
Ci. B. Grunwald, '45
