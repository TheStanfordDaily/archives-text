# Better Bridge For 25 Cents!
## 
### 
Bridge players — Do you trump
your partner's ace? Do you think
that "Blackwood" is a type of tree?
Do you get nervous or fidgity when
your partner jump bids you? Do
you over-bid? Under-bid? Bid at
all? Then STOP! You need help!
The Stanford Bookstore is the
place to go—Sam Gordon's "Horse
Sense Bridge" is the book to get.
Nothing complicated, yet everything
you have to know from passing to
going slam is right there —in black
and white. Guaranteed not to have
more than 10 words in it with more
than two syllables—just the thing for
Stanford bridge players. And, what's
more, this little necessity only costs
25 cents! Just the thing for Stanford
bridge players.
But that's not all. Not only does
Mr. Gordon explain bridge ethics,
scoring, and bidding, he even tells
how to throw a party or, better yet,
how to squelch an irate partner. His
suggestion is to "keep handy a card
on which is printed in large letters
the words: I'm sorry, partner. When
ever some player criticizes you, pre
sent this card."
You owe it to your partner, your
opponents, your fellow students —
and yes, even Stanford —to play
bridge the right way, the winning 1
way, the Sam Gordon Way! Get your
copy of "Horse Sense Bridge" at the
Bookstore today.
