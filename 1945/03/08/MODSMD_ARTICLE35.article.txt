Stanford Philological Association '
will hear Arthur E. Bestor Jr., as
sistant professor of humanities, lec
ture on "An American Venture in
Translationâ€”Ripley's Specimens of
Foreign Standard Literature (1838-
42)" today at 4:15 in the Lower
Lounge of the Faculty Women's
Clubhouse.
An increasing interest in continen
tal literatures underlay the literary
"flowering of New England" in the j
middle of the 19th century. To this
new interest contributions were
made by the so-called Transcen
dentalists, as well as by Harvard
professors, such as Ticknor, Everett, j
and Longfellow.
"The major Transce ndentalist j
achievement was the 14-volume !
'Specimens of Foreign Standard Lit- j
erature (1838-42)' edited by George
Ripley, founder of the Brook Farm i
community. This series included the
first English translation of Ecker
mann's 'Conversations with Goethe,' |
the most extensive collection of !
lyrics of Goethe and Schiller that
had yet appeared in translation, and
important works of French and Ger
man philosophy and literary his
tory," Mr. Bestor said.
