### DICK CRANE (Guest Sessioner 
Strolling into The Daily Shack, whistling "Back in the Saddle Again,"
I set my "li'l ol' fanny" in a chair before the typewriter, and begin to
frantically expound on the birth of a tremendous idea, which is rapidly
takng form, and will soon become a realitv.
But first, let me tell you the fascinating tale of how this whole idea came
into being.—Once upon a time, there were a group of Stanford students
sitting in a Rathskeller bar (warning to all people with colds), and ob
noxiously taking shots in the arm, and drinking "Rum and Coca-Cola."
They were embittered at everything in general, but at Stanford in par
ticular, because they had been ostracized from the student body for the
kind of a life they were leading, consequently they were spending their time
seeking some plan for revenge.
"What shall we do?", breathed one of the group, being unable to talk.
"How shall we get the bastids?", muttered another. Finally out of this
infernal tumult and general orgy came the clarion call—"I have just the
thing." "We will have* an OLYMPIC DAY!" So that dear readers, is how
this horrible affair was born.
Now I suppose you want to know what it is. I can't go too much into
detail, because the events are much too gory and sordid to really put into
print, however to give you an idea—Have you ever had pie in your hair,
eyes, ears, and on other various parts of your anatomy? Have you ever
tried to run 50 yards with your legs tied together? Have you ever had to
crawl 50 yards? (This last wasn't meant for a chosen few). Lastly, have you
ever been trapped by some women, even if you didn't want to be?
If any of these things haven't happened to you, be sure and enter some
of these events, because it will be something that will linger forever in
your memory (I guarantee it.)
You might have a perverse or sadistic streak in your nature, so if
you don't want to participate, you can at least come over to the Sunken
Diamond from 2 to 5 p.m. on this coming Saturday, and watch the less
fortunate entrants be maliciously and horribly tortured.
So let's have everyone attend this spectacle, and either laugh or cry.

this horrible affair was born.
Now I suppose you want to know what it is. I can't go too much into
detail, because the events are much too gory and sordid to really put into
print, however to give you an idea—Have you ever had pie in your hair,
eyes, ears, and on other various parts of your anatomy? Have you ever
tried to run 50 yards with your legs tied together? Have you ever had to
crawl 50 yards? (This last wasn't meant for a chosen few). Lastly, have you
ever been trapped by some women, even if you didn't want to be?
If any of these things haven't happened to you, be sure and enter some
of these events, because it will be something that will linger forever in
your memory (I guarantee it.)
You might have a perverse or sadistic streak in your nature, so if
you don't want to participate, you can at least come over to the Sunken
Diamond from 2 to 5 p.m. on this coming Saturday, and watch the less
fortunate entrants be maliciously and horribly tortured.
So let's have everyone attend this spectacle, and either laugh or cry.
