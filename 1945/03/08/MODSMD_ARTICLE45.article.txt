# Meritt Publishes Book Started 14 Years Ago
## 
### BARBARA WRIGHT 
Fourteen years ago in England and
on the Continent Dr. Herbert D.
Meritt of the English Department
was thumbing through Old English
manuscripts in search of glosses.
Ancient Anglo-Saxons made nota
tions in their Latin manuscripts,
much as students today make inter
linear notations in foreign language
books.
Discoveries made at that time are
the basis for Dr. Meritt's new book

soon to be published, "Old English
Glosses," of which he is now read
ing the gid ley proofs.
Worked Gradually
Although the book was begun 14
years ago, Dr. Meritt's work on it
has been far from steady. During
these same years he has published
another book, "The Construction of
'Apo Koinou' in the Germanic Lan
guages," not to mention raising a
family of two boys.
Professor Meritt was born in Dur
ham, North Carolina (home of
Duke's tobacco mixture—adv.), or,
in his own words, "A tar heel born,
and a tar heel bred; when I die, I'll
be a tar heel dead." His undergrad
uate work was completed at Ham
ilton College, after which he did
graduate work at Princeton.
Plans Future
As to future academic plans, Dr.
Meritt hopes someday to examine a
manuscript at Essen, Germany.
There might be some glosses in it.
He entertains similar hopes con
cerning manuscripts to be found in
a monastery at Gallen, Switzerland.
As to future non-academic plans,
Meritt would like to repeat such va
cations as one he experienced in the
days of his youth when canoeing
through Algonquin Park in Can
ada—a relatively unexplored region.
He would like nothing better, to
quote him as he concluded his ha
rangue, "than to pack into the wilds
on a canoe trip in the hope of fishing
for. and catching, some black bass.''
