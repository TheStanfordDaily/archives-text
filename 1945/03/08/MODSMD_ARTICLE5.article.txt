## 
### 
Stanford students have two days
in which to donate the $1,100 nec
essary to fulfill Stanford's quota in
the national Red Cross drive which
ends tomorrow. Every student has
been asked to contribute $2 to this
organization and those who have
not done so are asked to give their j
donations either today or tomorrow, j
according to Charmian Kolar, chair- j
man.
Miss Kolar asked that every
group which has not yet contrib
uted please turn in their money these
last two days.
Yesterday's collections brought
Stanford $.'{94.25 nearer its $3,000
goal with a total now of $1,915.05, I
announced Treasurer Franky Mc- j
Innis. Four more living groups
joined the 100 per cent group with
Robic 2 Center contributing $48;
Buchanan, $52; Koble 3C, $48; and
Mariposa, $47.
Other living groups helping to
swell the total were Roble 3 Center,
$50; Casa Naranja, $41.25; Roble 28.
$42; Roble 2C, $21; Washington Hall,
$43; and Oscar Thompson, individual
contributor, $2.
Living groups which have not yet
turned in their contributions may â€¢
do so at the A.S.S.U. office today and ;
Friday between the hours of 3 and !
5 in the afternoon. Miss Kolar asked i
all groups which have not yet got
ten 100 per cent in contributions to
keep on trying.
She emphasized the importance of
Stanford's part in this national drive
which has set a goal of 200 million
dollars for this year's quota. Stan
ford students who have friends or i
relatives in the service here, over- I
seas, and in enemy prison camps |
need not be told the importance of j
this vital organization. Its services j
do much to alleviate the sufferings j
of servicemen and civilians both at j
home and abroad.
