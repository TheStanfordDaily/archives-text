# All Star Squad Selected As Mural Season Closes
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
As a fitting close to the intra-mural
basketball season, the selection of an
all-star squad has to be made. The
choice, which has been left to me,
is a very difficult one, and 1 have
tried very diligently not to commit
myself by choosing several teams.
It is only right that the Army and
medical school squads have a sep
arate team of their own, because the
AST players have a definite advan
tage over civilians owing to their
rigorous physical training program.
I have also picked one team from
the civilian quintets of each of the
two leagues—Lagunita and Roble.
Many requests, however, have
been made for the selection of one
team from the whole mural league.
Both leagues have produced many
candidates for this team, and it is
only after careful consideration of
their ability and consistency that
the following stars have been chosen.
Forward — Morley Thompson —
Betas.
Consistently top point man and
first in defensive ability, Morley is
the logical candidate for the first
position on the team. It was he who
gave the Betas the shot in the arm
when they needed it, and this is so
aptly demonstrated by the fact that
without him they lost every encount
er they participated in.
Forward — Ed "Red" Prescott —
Cougars.
"Red's" sensational eye always
came through for the Cougar outfit,
and although he is not exceptionally
tall, his expertness at tip-ins was
nothing short of miraculous. Through j
his ability to bear down against any |
kind of competition, he led the j
Cougars to the Roble League cham- |
pionship.
Center—Tom Hood—Phi Psi's.
The selection of a member of the
great Phi Psi outfit was indeed diffi
cult, but the ease with which Hood
came through and his amazing con
sistency in point making were more
than enough to insure him a spot on
the first squad. It was he who came
through with a sensational shot to

give the Phi Psi team a 29-28 vic
tory —and a keg of beer—over the
Betas.
Guard—Tom Catlett—Cougars.
A comparative unknown to intra
mural fans, Catlett was one of the
best defensive artists in either league.
In spite of the height advantage of
his opponents, he almost always
managed to get the ball off the back
board by his ruggedness and the
use of his weight to his advantage.
He was another member of the
championship Cougar team.
Guard—Ken Ilusby—Legal Eagles.
Well known to all for his superb
backboard prowess, slow moving,
quick-thinking Ken was one of the
main cogs in the well-oiled Legal
Eagle outfit. His tricky ball handling
was a constant menace to all the
"Eagles" opponents. His potential
scoring ability is also greater than
that of most guards in either league.
The all-star selections from the
Lagunita League arc: Forwards:
Dennis Fox, Tyler; Dave Grey,
Gerona; Center: Jack Ilartwell, Legal
Eagles; Guards: Baron Lowe, Chi
nese Club; Ken Ilusby, Legal Eagles.
Roble League
Forwards: Luke Pitts, Phi Psi's;
Morley Thompson, Betas; Center:
Tom Hood, Phi Psi's; Guards: Don
Rouillard, Argucllo Cards; Dick Mar
quette, Phi Psi's.
AST AND MEDS
Forwards: Ed Prescott, Cougars;
Larry Corley, Med. 2; Center: Ken
Evans, Royal Flush; Guards: Tom
Catlett, Cougars; Harold Wilter
mood, Royal Flush.
To all these boys and the many
others who helped to make the intra
mural season a success, I. on behalf
of the "DAILY" sport staff—Adams,
Cohen, Jennings, and Levy—would
like to extend my sincere thanks. A
special note of praise to Harry Wol
ter, who so unselfishly gave his time
to the direction of the basketball
program.
