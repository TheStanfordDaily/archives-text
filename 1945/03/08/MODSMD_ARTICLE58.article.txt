# SIDELINE SLANTS...

### BILL ADAMS 
Well, this is all. The last week of
Daily publication has rolled around
again, and this is probably the last
"Slants" that I will ever write. Next
quarter the traditional septer of
authority, such as it is, goes to my
more than capable associate, Mort
Cohen. Sports editors never last very
long. After a quartet - or so they are
usually drafted, or fired, or hanged,
or something similar. Perhaps you
wonder what it is they're trying to
do during their brief reign of glory,
with their little strip of space
squashed up above the Roos Bros,
ad each day.
Purpose
We of winter quarter's sports staff;
Bob Slobe, Dick Jennings, Gordon
Levy, Mort Cohen, and myself, have
devoted our efforts sincerely and
wholeheartedly toward one object:
the return of intercollegiate athletics
to Stanford. The campus is experi
encing a dynamic revival of interest
in athletics, evident on every hand.
The tremendous interest in intra
mural basketball and the Palo Alto
Independents are examples. Many
universities and colleges which had
cancelled athletics when the war be
gan found it possible to field teams
once again. We sincerely believe that
it is time for our University to fol
low suit, and the achievement of this
end has been and will continue to be
our purpose, no matter who holds the
reins.
Independents
We have not been alone in our
efforts. Dave Brown. Jack Heald,
Morley Thompson , George Bower,
Ed Douglas, .the rest of the Palo Alto
Independents and the hundreds of
students who backed them loyally
have demonstrated more eloquently
than we ever could that the spirit
is still there. We salute them for
their courage in showing the rest of
us the way.
The movement will not stop here.
Interest in and agitation for athletics
will continue to grow until the ad
ministration is forced to heed the
voice of the students. We of the
sports staff believe it our job to keep
that interest growing and we have
done and will continue to do our best
to bring it to the fore.
