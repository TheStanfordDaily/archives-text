# Howie Dallmar Stars Again
## 
### MORT COHEN 
While Army was seeming to domi
nate every sport in the nation, in
cluding basketball, there arose a
squad fro m Pennsylvania which
didn't seem to agree with the critics
and felt that they could dump the
Army five. They weren't even given
a chance, but that didn't stop them,
for they beat Army and pulled one
of the biggest upsets of the year.
Now, you may wonder why we are
writing an article about a Pennsyl
vania team, so to make this article
relevant, we would like to write a
little on one of the players on that
team.
Tall Boy
He is tall, measures about six-feet
four, and is fairly thin. When he
first ran out on the courts back East
they called him the "Ugly-Duckling"
and wondered how such an awkward
player could even go out for basket
ball. In the first few games, he was
booed continually, for he always
seemed to throw the ball away; it
didn't dawn on the Penn rooters
that maybe his team-mates were the
ones to blame.
This went on and on, but slowly,
and very surely, those who knew
basketball began to sit up and take
notice. By the middle of the season
they realized that they were seeing
near perfection, and then they be
bun to acclaim this "awkward" boy
as a great Eastern star. By the end
of the season, this boy had led his
team to a championship and to a
spectacular victory over Army. Now
they are booming him for All -
American honors, and there is little
doubt about his winning them.
Great Star
But what they forgot is one little
thing; Howie Dallmar was always
a great star. From his junior high
days, Dallmar was watched as a
future protege, but it was not until
he came to high school that he really
showed what he could do. By the
time he was a junior in high school,
he was playing first string center.
While in high school, Dallmar was
so good that he was considered to
be one of the greatest preps San
Francisco has ever seen.
Given Medal â€”
Then Howie came to Stanford, and
in his sophomore year, played first
string on the National championship
team. He played great ball the whole
season and was one of the highest
scoring guards on the Coast. But it
was in the championship game that
Dallmar truly proved his worth, for
in that game with Dartmouth, he
was the outstanding player on the
floor. He was given a medal to prove
this.
Yes, Howie Dallmar was the
"Ugly-Duckling" who couldn't even
pass.
