# Independents Light a 'Spark' For Farm's Athletic Future
## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Braving the sound and fury that
Stanford could not possibly field a
basketball team capable of playing
in Bay Area competition, the Palo

Alto Independents brought back a
spark of the "will to win" and with
it the determination to field a team
regardless of the won-loss record.
What Dave Brown's team accom
plished was worth far more than
pennies in the coffers or a high place
in team standings. Player - Coach
Brown and his cohorts got them
selves some games in the Northern
California Basketball Association,
shouldered their own expenses,
together only once or
twice a week, and developed into a
first-rate outfit before their season
came to a close some two weeks
ago.

Starting off the season early in
December, the Independents rang
up victories over Santa Clara and
Auten's, a local club, to give a
fair indication of what was to
come in league games in San
Francisco's Kczar Pavilion.
Making their debut in the
NCBA, Brown's hunch dropped a
close one to the Fleet City Blue
jackets who, incidentally, were
mentioned to represent the Bay
Area in the AAU tourney this
month. During Christmas vaca
tion, the Independents managed to
thump Fort MacDowell in their
second league game. Brown tal
lied 15 points and as a result was
named to the all-league team for
that week.
Taking on one of the Coast's most
formidable fives, the Palo Altans
were nudged, 42-36, by the Armed
Guard of the Pacific. Morley
Thompson, the Independents' most
consistent point maker, took high
point honors of the night with 14.
Traveling to Redwood City, the
gold and white clad Independents
staged a terrific last period upsurge
to down the San Bruno Navy, 44-43.
Behind 34-16 with but ten minutes
to go, Thompson, Jack Heald, Ed
Douglas, Brown, et al. swished the
net with every attempt in their vic
tory over one of the Bay's finest
teams. Brown grabbed honors with
15, but Douglas' play was easily his
best of the season.
Staging a doublehcader in the
Palo Alto High gym, the Inde
pendents played before a crowd of
some 600 souls but lost the second
game of the Auten's series by the
tunc of 50-44. The reserves were
dumped by Menlo J.C. 45-35, in
the curtain raiser. Thompson once
again nabbed fame with a total of
14, being outscored by Auten's
Monk Moycrs with 17.
In their third NCBA struggle,
Brown's bunch led Chapel of the
Oaks most of the way, but lost a
last minute decision, 41-38. George
Bower, filling in for the departed
Bobby Kowe, and Ilcald found the
net consistently, but the Oaks team
nevertheless grabbed a well
earned victory.
In their next two encounters, the
Palo Altans dumped the Army All-
Stars by the count of 42-34 and then,
half depleted, sloppily presented the

Olympic Club with an NCBA vic
tory. Thompson, Heald, and Doug
las were the main PAI cogs against
the Army.
Unexpectedly playing their sea
son finale and also the rubber match y
of the Auten's series, the Independ
ents finished the season in tremen
dous style with a convincing 57-41
win over the "cocktail loungers."
Brown led scoring with 19 with Dick
Marquette, Douglas, and Heald giv
ing good support.
If it were necessary to pick the
No. 1 player, it would have to be
Thompson, whose average of over
12 points per game cannot be
sneezed at. Hut the rugged Brown,
the steady and smooth Ileald, the
cool Douglas, and the tall Bower
arc all a part of the 1945 Independ
ents, the version which brought
some bit of athletics back to an
eager Farm. There were more of
the Independents — Bob Rosburg,
Horace Chandler, Luke Pitts. Bob
Kowc, Dennis Fox, Dick Mar
quette, Tom Hood, Wayne Stater,
Al MacDowell, Tom Ashley—they
spoke for the Stanford Indians
who are absent today.
If and when sports return to the
Farm, there will be silent thanks to
the fellows who blazed the trail
and put the "will to win" above per
sonal glory and the win column. To
the Independents we gratefully dofl
our hats.


DAVE BROWN . . . the "will
to win" was above the glory.
