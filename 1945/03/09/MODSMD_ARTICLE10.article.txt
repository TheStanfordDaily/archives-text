# 52 YEARS AT STANFORD.
## Dr. Wilbur Comments on Stanford as Undergraduate, President, and Student Adviser. 
### 
A part of Stanford since he en
tered as a freshman with its sec
ond class. Dr. Kay Lyman W ilbur,
I Diversity Chancellor, has watched
the terms of four Stanford Presi
dents. the coming of two world
wars, the bold problems and subtle
changes that time has brought to
the campus.
"The charm of those early days
has never left inc. The freedom,
the wholesome. unconventional
ways, the personal association with
enthusiastic teachers, the absence
ol traditions, the presence of both

Senator and Mrs. Stanford, the
beautiful buildings, the University's
surroundings, all conspired to fos
ter in me a deep love for Stanford."
So spoke Dr. Wilbur in his inaugu
ral address following his unanimous
selection in 1916 as President by
the Hoard of Trustees.
Strangely appropriate are the
words of Dr. Wilbur in 1919: "We
feel the hurt of the gaps that,war
has cut in our phalanx of Stanford
men and women." Of the problems
confronting a world newly at peace,
he said to this graduating class,
"We send you forth into the con
tused problems of a civilization al
most wrecked by the results of its
own violence, and into the stifling
atmosphere of hopelessness, selfish
ness, partisanship, and mental tur
bulence."
Returning from his term as Sec
retary of the Interior in President
Hoover's cabinet, he said, "My four
years in Washington convince nic

i that general and widespread edu-
I cation has given fundamental .sta
bility to our American people . . ."
In a plea for tolerance toward
Japanese students, he said. " I hey
are just as good Stanford people
I , ,
I as \\ c are.
Addressing the graduating class
! in 1930. he said. "My hope i-- that
you will accept the responsibility
that the Stanford diploma gives
you. You arc no longer just your
self. You bear with you our Stan
{ ford banners. Hold them dear and
I hold them high."
