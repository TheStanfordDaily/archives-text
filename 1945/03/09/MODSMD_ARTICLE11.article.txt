# TRADITIONS OF THE FARM.
## Stanford Students Cherish Three: No Smoking on Quad, Law Steps, 'Say Hello' Policy. 
### 
The slogan. "No Smoking on
Quad": the giggles and accompany
ing applause ;i- students walk down
the Law steps; the shyness of --tu
dents as they exchange "hello's"
with fellow Stanford men and
women represent a large part of
our undersUindinir of the traditions

existing at Stanford today.
The tradition of no smoking on
the Quad was initiated at the re
quest of Mrs. Stanford a tew days
after the University opened in 1891.
'The Law steps tradition came later,
| when law students took over the
j steps as demonstration of the intel-
I lectual superiority they assumed.
Although formerly "hello's" were
exchanged on a basis of acquaint
ance, the growth of the Stanford
student body made it impossible for
students to know everyone in the
j community. As a result, it became
traditional among students to say
"hello" as an expression of con
geniality.
'These three traditions belong to
everyday living at Stanford, for un
like other traditions, they are not
restricted to certain classes, certain
seasons or occasions during the
year.
