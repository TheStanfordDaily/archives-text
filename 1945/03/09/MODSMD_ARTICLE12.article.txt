## An Historical Look at the Chapel as Seen Before the Quake Broke the "Eye." 
### Rod Browning 
Although Stanford University
was built in memory of Leland
Stanford, Jr., the Memorial Chapel
was 1 >11 ill in memory of Senator
Stanford. Mrs. Stanford, when the
building of the church was started
in 1890, obtained the best that could
be found for the church. The
stained glass windows were brought
from New York, and the mosaics
were done by Salviati and Company
of Venice, Italy.
Behind the altar there were 12
large white marble statues of the
12 apostles. These statues stood in
front of the niches which now con
tain the ornamental plants. They
were destroyed because they were
too large to lit in the niches and
nothing protected them from the
spire when it collapsed during the
earthquake of 1906.
The spire was a large, heavy
structure over the front part of the
church, and before the earthquake,
it contained the chimes which now
arc in a separate tower behind the
chapel. The main stained glass
window above- the entrance, now
sometimes called the Lily Window,
was originally a round rose win
dow before the latter was destroyed.
The "All-Seeing Eye" which was
in the top of the dome was famous
the world over. No matter where
an admiring saint or sinner stood
under the dome, the "Eye" appeared
to be staring down directly at him
with an expression of either kind
ness or stern judgment, depending
upon the conscience of the admirer.
During the earthquake of 1900
the heavy spire and the two side
galleries fell in. forcing the front
entrance side to fall out. It was
not until 1013 that the chapel was
restored to its former beauty.
Mrs. Stanford is quoted as sav
ing to John Casper Brainier, sec
ond President of the University,
"My heart is in the University, but
my soul is in this church." Most of
the inscriptions on the inside of the
chapel were written by Mrs. Stan
ford herself. She also stated that
the chapel wa-> to he non-sectarian,
and that politics were not to be dis
cussed there.
The number of visitors that come
to the church daily is -nuill indeed
compared to the crowds that came
before the war. However, many
former students return just to be
married in this famous chapel.
