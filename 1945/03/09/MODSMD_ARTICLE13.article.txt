This is the Inner Quad as it
looked in 1891 when Stanford Uni
versity was first opened by Sena
tor and Mrs. Leland Stanford.
In the foreground can be seen
a carriage, of the runabout type

common :o mat day. Also visible
is the old-fashioned bicycle with
the large front wheel and the small
rear one.
Gay Nineties fashions arc in
good display where two modish

j Stanford women of the day may
i be seen walking toward Memorial
j Court. Can it be that the gentle
-1 man behind them is in pursuit even
I as today?
