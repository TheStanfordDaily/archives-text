# THEIR IDEA
## 
### 
The dirty little shack where I write this edit,
the Cellar, or Quad step, or iibe desk where
you read it, Lake Lagunita or Palm Drive are
oil here because of an idea.
Ideas are rare c-nough in any age, and this
one has come to us perhaps to prove it. There
are not enough places like Stanford; and of all
thei'e places in it, are even the most beautiful
have more meaning, because ideas are closely
linked to them.
Some of the ideas are in our Honor Code, by
which we trust each other in academic work;
our Fundamental Standard, by which we expect
of each other honorable conduct and personal
honor both within and without the University;
our credo in learning, "Die Luft der Freiheit
Weht," by which we mean that each man is
free to work out his own intellectual salvation
. . . and form his own opinions.
Intimately connected with our ideas of Stan
ford are the great informality of our "Farm,"
the fact that our campus is more than a place
to "take" courses; it is a placfe where we live
and experience a close to idyllic four years,
where we may work out our intellectual and
personal faiths with people of our own age and
learned people who can advise us.
These ideas were fostered by Jane and Le
land Stanford to put to a good purpose the
grounds upon which their young son had spent
his childhood before his early death abroad.
We are in a most difficult position to evaluate
this family who looked to us to fulfill the aspi
rations which they had for their child.
The Stanfords lived in an era which is only
half a century gone. They lived too recently to
be reviewed in historical perspective; yet they
lived sufficiently in the past to be unfashion
able.
We live in a more sophisticated age, and
perhaps such things as their concern for our
instruction in the immortality of the soul (we
have learned it is at best an academic question)
make us smile at times. The elaborate way in
which they sought to perpetuate the family
names and cling to objects which would outlive
them is also out of fashion.
l! is a test of our own intellect to see, before
hi.story books explain it for us, that the family
who founded this place were a rare embodi
ment of an age that is scarcely past and has left
its mark upon our lives.
What we should further learn to our own
advantage is that it left, like any age, both bad
and good. And some of the best may be em
bodied in the faith the Stanfords had in the
c hildren of California, to make from these op
portunities a contribution to the public welfare.
Today we are to set aside a brief period to
hear about this, and to consider perhaps that
there is much to be revered in any individual
who act upon faith, discrimination, or in
tellectual conviction to conceive and promote
an idea such as this.
It is a tie between the founders and members
of this University that the ideas of freedom,
faith, and knowledge be expanded and strength
ened at Stanford for the benefit of all men.

hi.story books explain it for us, that the family
who founded this place were a rare embodi
ment of an age that is scarcely past and has left
its mark upon our lives.
What we should further learn to our own
advantage is that it left, like any age, both bad
and good. And some of the best may be em
bodied in the faith the Stanfords had in the
c hildren of California, to make from these op
portunities a contribution to the public welfare.
Today we are to set aside a brief period to
hear about this, and to consider perhaps that
there is much to be revered in any individual
who act upon faith, discrimination, or in
tellectual conviction to conceive and promote
an idea such as this.
It is a tie between the founders and members
of this University that the ideas of freedom,
faith, and knowledge be expanded and strength
ened at Stanford for the benefit of all men.
The dirty little shack where I write this edit,
the Cellar, or Quad step, or iibe desk where
you read it, Lake Lagunita or Palm Drive are
oil here because of an idea.
Ideas are rare c-nough in any age, and this
one has come to us perhaps to prove it. There
are not enough places like Stanford; and of all
thei'e places in it, are even the most beautiful
have more meaning, because ideas are closely
linked to them.
Some of the ideas are in our Honor Code, by
which we trust each other in academic work;
our Fundamental Standard, by which we expect
of each other honorable conduct and personal
honor both within and without the University;
our credo in learning, "Die Luft der Freiheit
Weht," by which we mean that each man is
free to work out his own intellectual salvation
. . . and form his own opinions.
Intimately connected with our ideas of Stan
ford are the great informality of our "Farm,"
the fact that our campus is more than a place
to "take" courses; it is a placfe where we live
and experience a close to idyllic four years,
where we may work out our intellectual and
personal faiths with people of our own age and
learned people who can advise us.
These ideas were fostered by Jane and Le
land Stanford to put to a good purpose the
grounds upon which their young son had spent
his childhood before his early death abroad.
We are in a most difficult position to evaluate
this family who looked to us to fulfill the aspi
rations which they had for their child.
The Stanfords lived in an era which is only
half a century gone. They lived too recently to
be reviewed in historical perspective; yet they
lived sufficiently in the past to be unfashion
able.
We live in a more sophisticated age, and
perhaps such things as their concern for our
instruction in the immortality of the soul (we
have learned it is at best an academic question)
make us smile at times. The elaborate way in
which they sought to perpetuate the family
names and cling to objects which would outlive
them is also out of fashion.
l! is a test of our own intellect to see, before
hi.story books explain it for us, that the family
who founded this place were a rare embodi
ment of an age that is scarcely past and has left
its mark upon our lives.
