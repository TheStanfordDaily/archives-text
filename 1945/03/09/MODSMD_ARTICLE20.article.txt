A backward glance at winter quarter '44-'45 shows
hours spent in the Cellar, in the Music Listening Room,
the Varsity, in playing footsie, in the Lake, in the
Texas, in the Kingsley Coaching Center. Winter quar
ter '44_'45 has obviously been a study quarter—with
the study concentrated in the last week.
Strangely enough, End-Quarter Fatigue has brought
with it countless uncorrected themes, unfinished lab
reports, forgotten term papers, make-up midterms, un
read texts and unanswered letters.
So, you vow that this avalanche of unfinished work
will not descend on you during Dead Week of spring
quarter '45-'45. No, next quarter everything will be
different.
You will . . .
. . . erase the boathouse, Mangotti's, the Waffle Shop,
Rossini's from your memory.
. . . start research on your term papers the afternoon
of Reg Day.
. . . give up smoking on Quad.
. . . attend more Thunder Rider meetings.
. . . co-operate with your hasher.
. . . stop complaining about the ants in the Civ Libe,
the seats in the Reserved Book Room, and the
gophers on the golf course.
. . . give up smoking in Mem. Aud.
. . . go to the Tuesday Evening Series.
. . . go plus hundreds.
. . . listen to more newscasts.
. . . learn to love your roommate.
. . . write home at least once a month.
. . . see the same movie once only.
. . . give up smoking.
. . . use all of your 1:30 a.m. floaters and culturals.
. . . stop making a fourth for bridge.
. . . lose the "Rabbit Habit" which has taken Roble by
storm.
Next quarter things will be different for me, too.
1 will lose the traditional bull-sessioner slouch and
baggy eyes, as someone else will stand target before
the firing squad of the Inner Quad.
Yes, with one exception life will be changed. The
exception? Folk Dancing TThF at 8 a.m.
QUAD DAMN!
