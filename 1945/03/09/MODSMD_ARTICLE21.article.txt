### Walrus the Carpenter 
TO THE WALRUS:
Sir,
The strictures of Mr. Smith on the youth of today
are the cause that persuades me to communicate some
thoughts of my own on the subject.
It has always been the practice of those who are
desirous to believe themselves made venerable by
length of time, to censure the newcomers into life for
want of respect to gray hairs and sage experience, for
rash confidence in their own understanding, for hasty
conclusions upon partial views, for disregard of advice
that their fathers and teachers are ready to provide and
a rebellious impatience of that subordination to which
youth is condemned by nature, as necessary to its
security from evils from which it would be otherwise
precipitated by the rashness of passion and the blind
ness of ignorance.
Every old man complains of the growing depravity
of the world, of the petulance and insolence of the
rising generation. He recounts the decency and regu
larity of former times and celebrates the discipline and
sobriety of the age in which his youth was passed.
Yet they who have opportunities to establish their
authority over ductile and unresisting minds, they who
are the protectors of helplessness and the instructors
of ignorance, must defeat their influence by their own
misconduct, and make use of all these advantages with
very little skill, if they cannot secure to themselves an
appearance of respect, and ward of! open mockery and
declared contempt.
The general story of mankind will evince that law
ful and settled authority is very seldom resisted when
it is well employed. Gross corruption, or evident im
becility, is necessary to the suppression of that rever
ence with which the majority of mankind look upon
their governors.
Men are drawn by their passions into forgetful
ness of invisible rewards and punishments, yet they
are easily kept obedient to those who have temporal
dominion in their hands, till their veneration is dis
sipated by such wickedness or folly as can neither be
defended nor concealed.
It may, therefore, be reasonably suspected that the
old draw upon themselves the greatest part of those
insults which they so much lament, and that age is
rarely despised but when it is contemptible.
These considerations I would draw to the attention
of Mr. Smith of Tyler Hall that he may ponder them
when next he is moved to critiicze the conduct of the
undergraduates in his charge.
I am, dear Sir,
Your faithful, humble servant,
Sam Johnson
