To (he Editor:
When the people walking by your house start hold
ing their noses and pointing, you may resent the infer
ence and start rushing out with a baseball bat to
knock them dead ... or there may be a dead rat
somewhere.
Perhaps we shouldn't refer to the Honor Code with
such a homely simile, but Stanford has an old tradition
that was known as a sure-fire dead-rat indicator: the
system of tapping with a pen or pencil on the desk or
table during an exam when someone was suspected of
cheating, until the offending member ceased his sus
picious activities.
Faculty members of long standing on the campus
have said that they feel our Honor Code is getting
shabby, that we haven't been taking enough pains to
maintain it and to honor it. Anybody can blow their
top to prove to the faculty that their inference is
incorrect, but it takes more than hot air to polish up
the Stanford "Emblem" on its "Coat-of-Arms," and
that is about what the Horror Code is to most of the
people at Stanford who are now so concerned over it.
And that is just what it should he. Out it ought to
be so shiny that it would be ridiculous to call it
"shabby."
Tapping is one way of using the standard, acting
through the greater power given by the group, to
bring the isolated and offending member of that group
to a consciousness of the power of that standard.
Tapping is one concrete way of illustrating our
colective concern for the maintenance, the upkeep,
of the Honor Code without the grubby and sniveling
connotations, inherent in the Stanford student, of
squealing.
