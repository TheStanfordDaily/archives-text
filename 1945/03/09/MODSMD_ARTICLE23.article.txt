HISTORY. 1945
The center of the German Army is
broken, and Allied power is spilling
into the Rhineland, and even be
yond. The Rhine is crossed, and Von
Rundstedt, in command of a shat
tered, demoralized army is meeting
the biggest test of his career.
The middle of the German line was
destroyed so completely that General
Hodges could smash through to
Cologne and lay a bridgehead across
the Rhine before Von Rundstedt
could do anything about it. Only
1,000 men defended the great Ger
man cathedral city, and these were
simply swept aside.
Nazi Soldier Knows Fate
In addition, the German soldier
knows that he is beaten. He is sur
rendering in droves, because nobody
wants to be the last man shot in a
lost cause. The man at the front is
the last to know the end is at hand,
and the Nazi trooper realizes it. This
is the most crucial factor in the
scale against Von Rundstedt.
But the question is, what reserves
does Von Rundstedt have on the
light bank of the Rhine?
A commander defending a river
never lines his best troops up along
the bank. The enemy, by quickly
concentrating, and punch a hole in
his line and do irreparable damage
before he could concentrate. The
standard policy is to dump reserves
in the main road junctions, rushing
them to the attacker's bridgehead
before it can be completely secured.
If Von Rundstedt Can
If Von Rundstedt has reserves over
the river, he might stabilize his posi
tion or even counterattack, but, if
he does not and cannot get them in
time, then the war is over for the
Germans.
But, even if he can dig in fast
enough, there is still a threat from
the Third Army sector, where Gen

j eral Patton has been conducting
i some brilliant operations.
First, his Army broke through the
j German lines by capturing the key
center of Trier, and then started
; fanning out, bis armor breaking up
into small columns.
The enemy rushed what scanty ,
tactical reserves there were in an
attempt to check him. These units 1
j were too weak to hold the whole |
front, so they simply concentrated â– 
on the main roads, thinking that, J
while Patton could follow any of the I
secondary ones, they wouldn't be |
suited to the heavy traffic of supply
I columns.
I Patton on Nazi Gas
But Patton united his armor sud- !
| denly, shot down one of the second
i ary roads. What probably happened ;
| was that he decided to cut loose from
i his supply lines, hoping to live off
( German gasoline dumps. He seems
i to be succeeding.
At any rate, if he can keep his
momentum and get across the Rhine
where it joins the Moselle, at Cob
! lenz, he might pass beyond Van
Rundstedt's right if the latter at
tempts to contain Hodges in his
! bridgehead.
| Also, if Patton crosses the Rhine
and goes southeast to Frankfort, and
will have reachcd the Main, a fairly
broad river flowing perpendicularly
to the Rhine towards the interior
of Germany. This would anchor the
right flank of our invasion of Ger
many, and make a campaign in the
Black Forest unnecessary.
Von Rundstedt's northern wing is
being compressed into a pocket by
the Canadians and the Ninth Army,
both driving into its flanks. In order
to save his Army from being caught
in between, Von Rundstedt has had
to tie down large reserves in this
sector, which might reduce the num
ber he has facing Hodges, or make
it zero. The prospects, indeed, look
very, very, .^ood.
