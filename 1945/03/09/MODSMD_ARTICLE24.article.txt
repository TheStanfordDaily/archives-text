The tremendous combination of the
Olympic Day and the Sadie Hawkins
dance promise to make the last ac
tive event of the quarter one that
will linger long in the memory of
the Stanford student, especially the
men.
A chance to engage in an after
noon of funny but strenuous activity,
a good dance (with the females foot
ing the bill for a novel change), and
a quick breather from studies be
fore the final plunge in the bog of
dead week and finals. All of this to
end one of the better quarters in a
long time.
Full Quarter
This quarter filled with more than
its share of fun and parties, a taste
of athletics, in the person of the
PAl's, a full lake with promises of
a terrific spring quarter, and all in
all a good congenial and highly
compatible group to have spent, it
with.
Looking back over the events of
the quarter it would be hard to en
numerate the outstanding events.
Sunny afternoons in the country,
communing with nature; the fine
soph cotillion, of which the sophs can
be justly proud; the big party with
the Phi Psis, in which the squadron
took off in mass; the D G dance,
easily the best house dance of the
quarter, and dozens of others. Pull
your head out of the tear bucket
and have a quickie will you before
you break out in a long lament.
As Time Flits
All of these factors add up to one
heli of a good time and it is easy to
see that time flitted, for it is hard to
realize that it is just about gone but
thats the situation and naught that
mortals can do will change it.
This started out to be a plug for
the Olympic Day, which would not
really need plugging if the students
realized the tremendous time which
is planned for them. If you want to
spend an afternoon you will not
forget for a long time drop over to

the Sunken Diamond on Saturday
afternoon, if you don't come and
miss (he fun, don't blame anyone but
