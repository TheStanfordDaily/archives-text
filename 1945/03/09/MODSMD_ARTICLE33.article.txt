# Shelley Mydans Tells Santo Tomas Prison Camp Life in New Book, 'The Open City'
## 
### GRETA SIEMENS 
Shelley Smith Mydans, former
Stanford student who just wrote
"The Open City," has been reporting
under Admiral Nimitz's command
on Guam for "Life" and "Time"
magazines since last November,
while waiting to join her corre
spondent - photographer husband,
Carl Mydans, who has been cover
ing Mac Arthur's recapture of Ma
nila for "Life" and "Time."
From the fall of Manila in De
cember 1941 until December 1943,
Mr. and Mrs. Mydans had been in
terned in Santo Tomas, Japanese
prison camp at Manila, and in an
other prison camp at Shanghai. On
December 2, 1943, the Gripsholm,
exchange ship on its second voyage
home, deposited them in New York.
Book Describes Prison Camp
Mrs. Mydans was only in the
United States a short while when
she wrote her novel, "The Open
City," describing their treatment and
experiences in the Jap camps. She
wrote the first draft of that book at
her home on the Stanford campus.
Mrs. Mydans is a Stanford girl.
Her mother is May Hurl hurt Smith,
after whom the May Hurlburt House
is named; and her father was Everett
W. Smith, founder and head of Stan
ford's journalism department until
his death in 1933. Mrs. Mydans went
to Stanford from 1932 to 1934, but in
1935 she left here and went to New
York where she hoped to act or
dance on the stage.

With 'Literary Durcst'
After Mrs. Mydans had danced for
some months in New York, she be
came a member of the "Literary Di
gest" staff. Shortly after, that mag
azine folded, and in 1937 she was
put on the "Life and Time" staff as
a researcher.
As a researcher, Mrs. Mydans
sometimes had to accompany pho
tographers and obtain the informa
tion that belonged with the pictures
they took. It was in 1938, when she
was acting in this capacity, that she

met and married Carl Mydans. In
1939 she went to London with him
as a war correspondent.
In Europe, Mr. and Mrs. Mydans
were usually separated. While he
covered the Finnish-Russian war,
she was reporting in Sweden; when
he was in Italy, she was in Portugal.
It was only after he was evacuated
from France, where he had gone
after leaving Italy with the French,
that they were finally reunited.
Trips to Far East
And then, in 1941, they went to
the Malay Peninsula; they went to
China: up the Yellow River, and
into Chungking, where they were
waiting to go into Russia. They
were told by officials in Chungking
that they would have to wait about
a month before they could get the
visas that would enable them to go
to Russia.
At that time, they received a ca
blegram from "Life" suggesting that
they spend a few weeks in the Phil
ippines while they were waiting for
the visas. The flew to Manila, and
were there only a little while when
that city was attacked by the Japa
nese. The 22 months Mrs. Mydans
and her husband spent in Japanese
prison camps and occupied territory
is described in Mrs. Mydans' book.
Book Appeared Last Month
"The Open City" appeared in print
for the first time last month. When
I asked Mrs. Mydans' mother about
the book, she told me that Mrs. My
dans had written a great deal of it

last summer when she was home.
She said that although her daughter
had wanted a "literary" book, she
thought that Mrs. Mydans had pro*
dueed a "reporter's novel" — but,
nevertheless, a good novel.
Mrs. Smith chose to say, in much
the same way that "Time" com
mented on the book, that Mrs. My
dans' "choice of words was discrimi
nating"; that the story is "touch
ing" and "sensitive." But, most im
portant, Mrs. Mydans' book truth
fully depicts life in a Jap prison
camp. Mrs. Smith mentioned that
her daughter is planning to write
another book sometime—a book that
might deal with some of her ad
ventures in Europe or Asia.
Six Years' Experience
And Shelley Mydans will have
things to write about. Within six
years she s been in and out of war
ring countries; she's been in and out
of enemy prison camps; and now
she's back in the midst of a war.
She's been a successful author and
reporter—she has successfully sur
vived the most horrible "horrors of
war."
Although "Life" magazine (No
vember 23, 1943) calls Mr. and Mrs.
Mydans " 'Life's' first and most bril
liant photographer- reporter team,"
Mrs. Smith only says of her famous
daughter's experiences: "We have a
saying about Shelley—we say that,
no matter what happens, Shelley al
ways lands on her feet."

Mrs. Mydans was only in the
United States a short while when
she wrote her novel, "The Open
City," describing their treatment and
experiences in the Jap camps. She
wrote the first draft of that book at
her home on the Stanford campus.
Mrs. Mydans is a Stanford girl.
Her mother is May Hurl hurt Smith,
after whom the May Hurlburt House
is named; and her father was Everett
W. Smith, founder and head of Stan
ford's journalism department until
his death in 1933. Mrs. Mydans went
to Stanford from 1932 to 1934, but in
1935 she left here and went to New
York where she hoped to act or
dance on the stage.

With 'Literary Durcst'
After Mrs. Mydans had danced for
some months in New York, she be
came a member of the "Literary Di
gest" staff. Shortly after, that mag
azine folded, and in 1937 she was
put on the "Life and Time" staff as
a researcher.
As a researcher, Mrs. Mydans
sometimes had to accompany pho
tographers and obtain the informa
tion that belonged with the pictures
they took. It was in 1938, when she
was acting in this capacity, that she

met and married Carl Mydans. In
1939 she went to London with him
as a war correspondent.
In Europe, Mr. and Mrs. Mydans
were usually separated. While he
covered the Finnish-Russian war,
she was reporting in Sweden; when
he was in Italy, she was in Portugal.
It was only after he was evacuated
from France, where he had gone
after leaving Italy with the French,
that they were finally reunited.
Trips to Far East
And then, in 1941, they went to
the Malay Peninsula; they went to
China: up the Yellow River, and
into Chungking, where they were
waiting to go into Russia. They
were told by officials in Chungking
that they would have to wait about
a month before they could get the
visas that would enable them to go
to Russia.
At that time, they received a ca
blegram from "Life" suggesting that
they spend a few weeks in the Phil
ippines while they were waiting for
the visas. The flew to Manila, and
were there only a little while when
that city was attacked by the Japa
nese. The 22 months Mrs. Mydans
and her husband spent in Japanese
prison camps and occupied territory
is described in Mrs. Mydans' book.
Book Appeared Last Month
"The Open City" appeared in print
for the first time last month. When
I asked Mrs. Mydans' mother about
the book, she told me that Mrs. My
dans had written a great deal of it

last summer when she was home.
She said that although her daughter
had wanted a "literary" book, she
thought that Mrs. Mydans had pro*
dueed a "reporter's novel" — but,
nevertheless, a good novel.
Mrs. Smith chose to say, in much
the same way that "Time" com
mented on the book, that Mrs. My
dans' "choice of words was discrimi
nating"; that the story is "touch
ing" and "sensitive." But, most im
portant, Mrs. Mydans' book truth
fully depicts life in a Jap prison
camp. Mrs. Smith mentioned that
her daughter is planning to write
another book sometime—a book that
might deal with some of her ad
ventures in Europe or Asia.
Six Years' Experience
And Shelley Mydans will have
things to write about. Within six
years she s been in and out of war
ring countries; she's been in and out
of enemy prison camps; and now
she's back in the midst of a war.
She's been a successful author and
reporter—she has successfully sur
vived the most horrible "horrors of
war."
Although "Life" magazine (No
vember 23, 1943) calls Mr. and Mrs.
Mydans " 'Life's' first and most bril
liant photographer- reporter team,"
Mrs. Smith only says of her famous
daughter's experiences: "We have a
saying about Shelley—we say that,
no matter what happens, Shelley al
ways lands on her feet."

gest" staff. Shortly after, that mag
azine folded, and in 1937 she was
put on the "Life and Time" staff as
a researcher.
As a researcher, Mrs. Mydans
sometimes had to accompany pho
tographers and obtain the informa
tion that belonged with the pictures
they took. It was in 1938, when she
was acting in this capacity, that she

met and married Carl Mydans. In
1939 she went to London with him
as a war correspondent.
In Europe, Mr. and Mrs. Mydans
were usually separated. While he
covered the Finnish-Russian war,
she was reporting in Sweden; when
he was in Italy, she was in Portugal.
It was only after he was evacuated
from France, where he had gone
after leaving Italy with the French,
that they were finally reunited.
Trips to Far East
And then, in 1941, they went to
the Malay Peninsula; they went to
China: up the Yellow River, and
into Chungking, where they were
waiting to go into Russia. They
were told by officials in Chungking
that they would have to wait about
a month before they could get the
visas that would enable them to go
to Russia.
At that time, they received a ca
blegram from "Life" suggesting that
they spend a few weeks in the Phil
ippines while they were waiting for
the visas. The flew to Manila, and
were there only a little while when
that city was attacked by the Japa
nese. The 22 months Mrs. Mydans
and her husband spent in Japanese
prison camps and occupied territory
is described in Mrs. Mydans' book.
Book Appeared Last Month
"The Open City" appeared in print
for the first time last month. When
I asked Mrs. Mydans' mother about
the book, she told me that Mrs. My
dans had written a great deal of it

last summer when she was home.
She said that although her daughter
had wanted a "literary" book, she
thought that Mrs. Mydans had pro*
dueed a "reporter's novel" — but,
nevertheless, a good novel.
Mrs. Smith chose to say, in much
the same way that "Time" com
mented on the book, that Mrs. My
dans' "choice of words was discrimi
nating"; that the story is "touch
ing" and "sensitive." But, most im
portant, Mrs. Mydans' book truth
fully depicts life in a Jap prison
camp. Mrs. Smith mentioned that
her daughter is planning to write
another book sometime—a book that
might deal with some of her ad
ventures in Europe or Asia.
Six Years' Experience
And Shelley Mydans will have
things to write about. Within six
years she s been in and out of war
ring countries; she's been in and out
of enemy prison camps; and now
she's back in the midst of a war.
She's been a successful author and
reporter—she has successfully sur
vived the most horrible "horrors of
war."
Although "Life" magazine (No
vember 23, 1943) calls Mr. and Mrs.
Mydans " 'Life's' first and most bril
liant photographer- reporter team,"
Mrs. Smith only says of her famous
daughter's experiences: "We have a
saying about Shelley—we say that,
no matter what happens, Shelley al
ways lands on her feet."

Stanford student who just wrote

Book Describes Prison Camp

her home on the Stanford campus.
Mrs. Mydans is a Stanford girl.
Her mother is May Hurl hurt Smith,

his death in 1933. Mrs. Mydans went
to Stanford from 1932 to 1934, but in
1935 she left here and went to New
York where she hoped to act or
dance on the stage.

some months in New York, she be
