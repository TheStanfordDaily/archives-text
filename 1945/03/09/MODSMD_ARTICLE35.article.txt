"Will you please turn off that
clock?" George muttered sleepily.
"But that's no clock, we're being
cremated," shouted Igor Beaver, his
roommate.
After soaking their books in light
er fluid, dozens of sleepy ASTudents
staggered drunkenly down the stair
way into the cold grey night—but no
George. Roll call, and still our friend
was missing. The next morning
Comrade George faced the inquisi

of bed for the fire alarm?"
"Well, you see, sir, 1 thought it was

Roger the lodger sat quietly in a
dark corner of the Cellar, trying to
drown his sorrows in double cokes.
Having missed chow at the exclu
sive Encina Club, he felt that the
whole day was a flop. He was so
sad in fact that he didn't see the face
of his social chairman, weaving
across the crowded floor. Before he
had a chance to hide, a voice boomed
softly in his ear.
"W'hatsa matter, son, can't you
get a date?"
"Yes."
"Well, don't worry, I'll fix you up—
I'm a trainee officer."
"But they don't let us Co. C- men
stay out after eight-thirty. Any
way, liquor's my weakness." He
swilled down the coke.
The social chairman was im
pressed; but as the new round of
drinks came, Roger slipped under
the table. "Poor kid." smiled the
social chairman. Then he looked up
to see a pair of glassy eyes staring
into his.

"No, it can't be," he muttered
hopefully.
j "But it is—" said a Gravel Gertie
voice.
"Jerry!"

Roger the lodger sat quietly in a
dark corner of the Cellar, trying to
drown his sorrows in double cokes.
Having missed chow at the exclu
sive Encina Club, he felt that the
whole day was a flop. He was so
sad in fact that he didn't see the face
of his social chairman, weaving
across the crowded floor. Before he
had a chance to hide, a voice boomed
softly in his ear.
"W'hatsa matter, son, can't you

"But they don't let us Co. C- men
stay out after eight-thirty. Any
way, liquor's my weakness." He
swilled down the coke.
