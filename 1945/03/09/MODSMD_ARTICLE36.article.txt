# Phi Delts vs. Phi Psi Team
## 
### 
In what is termed' a "grudge"
battle, the amazing Phi Delts are
slated to meet up with the powerful
Phi Psi quintet tonight at 7:30 in
the Encina Gym, house of basket
ball.
By virtue of their 30-24 win over
the Betas in a sparkling upset, the
Phi Delts should be favored to win,
but hoop prognosticators on campus
are backing the strong Phi Psi Club.
The latter outfit also nipped the
Betas, but only by a meager one
point margin.
Husby, liall Start
,Against the Phi Psi's, the Phi Delts
are planning to start Ken Husby
and Ed Hall at the forward posts,
Dave Grey at center, and Johnny
Burris and Joe Pickering at guards.
Ray Ryan, sharp shooting forward,
will also see plenty of action.
For this "championship of the
Row" match, the Phi Psi's will throw
their strong first team. Tom Ashley
and Dick Marquette at guards, Tom
Hood at center, and John Nesbit
and Luke Pitts at forwards. Last
minute strategy may find these boys
in different positions.
liood, Phi Psi Threat
The Phi Delt hopes rest on the
shoulders of Big Ed Hall, who is a
consistent high scorer. Tom Hood
is the main Phi Psi scoring threat.
