# Program Orders Must Be Placed
## 
### 
To avoid last-minute disappoint
ment, all seniors should place their
orders for graduation announce
ments and Senior Week programs
now, announced Mrs. Helena Bou
chow, maager of the Bookstore.

By placing their orders immedi
ately, will help the Book
store anticipate the number of or
ders to have printed and will assure
plenty of copies. The reason for
ordering early is that the printing
has to be done by an Eastern firm.
Seniors who have graduated since
last summer quarter and the med
students in San Francisco will be
contacted and may place their or
ders directly with the Bookstore via
mail.
The senior programs, which re
semble the leather-bound booklets
shown at the senior meeting, will
cost $1.25, and the announcements
will be 10 cents apiece.
