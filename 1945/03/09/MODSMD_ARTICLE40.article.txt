# Campus Mailman Loaded Down
## Ross Cox Carries Interdepartmental Letters for Campus Offices 
### 
Ross Cox and your reporter started
out from the Ad Building one morn
ing about 9 to deliver the interde
partmental mail, that is the mail that
one department delivers to another.
It does not have postage stamps on
it.
Mr. Cox arrives at the Ad Build
ing every morning at 7 to sort out
all the mail that has come in. He
also has to deliver all the United
States mail to the various depart
ments within the Ad Building. By
9 a.m. he is usually ready to start
out on his morning delivery.
Reporter Accompanies
On this particular morning Mr.
Cox left the building loaded down
with letters and folders, while your
reporter carried only her notebook
and pencil. We went first to the
Schools of Business, Law, Political
Science, Food Research, English, Hu
manities, E.S.M.W.T., and the School
of Engineering.
In all these departments, Mr. Cox
stopped for a few minutes to talk
with the secretaries. In the latter
office he started to walk away acci
dentally with the secretary's date
stamper. She caught him just in time
however, and his quick comeback
was, "I only wanted a date with
you."

The next stops were Mechanical
Engineering, Classics, G e o g raphy,
Romanic Languages, Economics, His
tory, and the Dean of History Office.
Then Mr. Cox lights up a cigarette
because he knows he will not be
walking on the Quad for awhile,
and journeys to Dr. Wilbur's office
in the Hoover War Libe, the main
Libe, where he remarked he could
kill some secretaries lor giving him
so much mail to carry, and the Edu
cation Building.
Stops; Talks
When he stops at each department,
he not only leaves the mail for the
department, but picks up mail for
other departments.
In each department he introduced
his reporter companion to the sec
retary in one of the following ways:
"This girl is from The Daily and is
writing a story on me, so if she
should come back later, don't you
tell her anything about me"; or,
"This girl and I are writing a book
about 'Secretaries I Have Known"
(in which I will tell all); or, "This
Daily reporter is writing a story on
me and I am taking her with me this
morning to wear her out so she'll
collapse and forget everything I've
told her."
Next we went to the Memorial
Church, (where Mr. Cox says he

marries his companions), to Electron
Optics, Aeronautics, Stores, Police
and Fire Departments, Superintend
ent of Buildings and Grounds, Min
ing, Graphic Arts, Geology, Mathe
matics, Slavic Languages, Philos
ophy, German, Law, and the Presi
dent and Vice-president's offices.
Ad Building
Then we went back to the Ad
Building and Mr. Cox took mail
around to each department there.
Then he sorted the mail which had
come into his office while he was
gone. Anything urgent goes out right
away. On this morning he took mail
to Physics, Psychology, Physiology,
Bio-Chemistry, and Biology.
It was then 11:15 a.m., and your
reporter was so tired, she had to
leave to recuperate. Mr. Cox, how
ever, makes another delivery at noon
in which he covers the Union, Cel
lar, Bookstore, and Post Office, and
repeats most of his morning route
in the afternoon.
Mr. Cox also takes pay checks to
the professors and secretaries of each
department. "The end of the month
is the only time they'll speak to me,"
he said.
"When I go home at night, I like
to take off my shoes and rest," he
said. "I enjoy reading almost any
thing, and I like to go to movies.

However, I usually just pick the good
ones and go to those."
On Farm 14 Years
He has been at Stanford 14 years
and has held this job for 13. During
his first year here, he worked in
the Corporation Yard.
"I graduated from Notre Dame
like a good Episcopalian," he said.
After that, he traveled all over the
United States as secretary to Richard
Manshfield, the actor. He then went
to Arizona to work on the Roosevelt
Dam, a government project, and also
did some court reporting there.
In 1917, he moved to Fresno where
he worked with California Fruit and
Raisin Growers. He now lives in
Palo Alto, and has two sons, one of
whom has been over in France the
past two years, and the other, a
sophomore at Stanford.
Likes Job
"I like my job a great deal," he
said, "because I am out-of-doors
most of the time and can keep
healthy." He doesn't think Stanford
students have changed much since
the war. "Kids are the same whether
in uniform or not."
He does think the mail service has
increased greatly since the war, how
ever, and thinks his route is much
harder since the campus has spread
out so much.
