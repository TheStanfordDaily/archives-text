# Yanks Cross Rhine, Storm Inner Germany
## U.S. Army Takes Remagen Bridge; Drives Germans Back Four Miles 
### 
PARIS, Friday, March 9 (UP). —
American First Army troops have
crossed the Rhine and early today
were reported to have driven at
least four miles beyond the east bank
into inner Germany.
The initial crossing by a small U.S.
force was made late Wednesday, but
it was the signal for a general all
out push across the Rhine at an un
specified point south of Cologne.
Front reports said that thousands of
First Army troops streamed across
the river, taking with them their big
guns.
Front reports indicated that the
first crossing was made on a bridge

captured intact at Remagen in one
of the most brilliant coups of the
European war.
The bridge—the double track, five
span, 917-foot Luedendorf rail bridge
—is sufficient to carry the whole
First Army into Germany's inner
fortress within a matter of days.
There was no major resistance
against the swiftly expanding
bridgehead and the Germans al
ready have been pushed back be
yond light artillery range of the
Rhine—at least four miles —it was
made known at Allied Supreme
Headquarters.
All facts concerning the exact na
ture and point of the crossing were
suppressed by censorship, which
disclosed only that it was made at
4:30 p.m. Wednesday in the area be
tween Cologne and Coblenz.
