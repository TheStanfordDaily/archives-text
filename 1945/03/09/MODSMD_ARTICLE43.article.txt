LONDON, March 8 (UP).â€”Rus
sian troops have driven ten miles
west of the Oder to within 26 miles
of Berlin, but have been thrown
back seven miles in a continuing
battle into which both sides are
pouring all available power, Ger
man reports said last night.
The peak point of the advance
was reached several days ago at See
low, due east of the Reich capital
and eleven miles southwest of the
beseiged capital of Kuestrin, which
lies astride the Oder, the Berlin
radio said.
While not confirming these re
ports, Moscow announced that the
Red Army had thrown a 40-mile
seige arc around Stettin in advances
to within six miles of that Baltic
port and had driven into the Danzig
Free State to within 11 miles of Dan
zig city.
