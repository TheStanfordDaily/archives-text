### 
GUAM, Friday, March 9 (UP).—
U.S. Marines on Iwo apparently
reached the northeastern corner of
the island Thursday and split the
Japanese garrison as they attacked
resolutely in the face of heavy re
sistance and made small gains in all
sectors.
With tanks supporting the ad
vance, Marines of the Third, Fourth,
and Fifth divisions fought doggedly
forward yard by yard against undi
minished Japanese resistance, Fleet
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz an
nounced.
At the northeast corner of the
island, the Third Marines apparently
drove through the last Japanese po

sitions before the 100-foot cliff" over
looking the steep beach in that area.
Thus, the Japanese at the northern
end of Iwo were cut off from those
along the eastern coast except along
the rough beach which now can be
brought under American fire from
the cliff.
