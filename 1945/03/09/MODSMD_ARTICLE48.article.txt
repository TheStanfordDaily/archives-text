# Lake Lagunita Started As Irrigation Reservoir
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
It is said that Governor Stanford
had the present Lake Lagunita made
when, in the early eighties, he
ordered the ground excavated and
had the lake bed covered with clay,
thus correcting a porous condition
of the soil which previously had al
lowed the water to drain away as
soon as it collected.
The lake was originally planned
as an irrigation reservoir. The people
who first inhabited this region lived
in the hills where they were able
to procure water easily. As people
moved down from the hills onto the
flat lands they found that water for
irrigation was scarce due to the
porousness of the land. Water drain
ing from the hills onto this land
would soak into the ground leaving
no visible supply such as a lake or
stream.

| Plans were then developed for the
: excavation of a lake for irrigational
i purposes, thus forming Lagunita.
When the first attempt was made to
store water in it, the water drained
away through the porous soil of the
lake bottom.
To correct this condition, the lake
bed was completely covered with
tons of clay, and then sheep were
forced to mill around the bottom in
order to pack the clay. Water col
lected in the reservoir thus formed
' was used to irrigate 160 acres of
| alfalfa land, land now covered by
| the University.
Crew Discovers Lake
When Stanford came into exist
ence, some of the students discovered
that the lake would be an ideal loca
tion for crew meets. Some of the
athletes began climbing over the
fences to the lake in order to prac
tice. This crew activity soon gave
rise to interest among the students
for the establishment of the only
i boating and swimming center in the
I vicinity.
Previously, the crew had built a
small boathouse for the sheltering
of their boats, but this one was re
! placed by a second boathouse built
under the direction of the associated
j students.
Boathouse Collapses
This second boathouse collapsed
j during the spring water carnival and
! had to be replaced by the present
house. There were no serious in
juries as a result of this accident.
After the lake was established as
a swimming center, accidents such
as drownings occurred. This led to
the placing of lifeguards and the
drafting of precautionary measures
by the students in order to insure
•Safety of the swimmers and boaters.
Lake Lagunita was created by hol
lowing out the grpund and throw
ing up an embankment with the soil
so as to form a bowl to contain the
water. As the years passed the rains
would bring the rich sediments of
earth from the hills.
The Big Job
Residents in this area realized
j the value of this rich top soil and
; began to collect it during the sum
mers to replace the exhausted min
| erals of the soil around their
j homes. So popular had the lake bed
[ become for its prized soil, that the
people dug as far as the clay layer,
l and even began to remove some
of this clay. Dr. Banner, seeing that
the removal of this clay would un
cork the bottom of the lake, banned
the removal of any soil from the lake
i bed.
According to the Stanford Illus
! irated Review, ''Lagunita is one of
' the best examples of feeding ground
in the state. Three times the volume
of the lake percolates (soaks)
through each year to replenish the
water table. Actual experiments have
shown that all wells in the immedi
ate vicinity, and particularly those

of the University, are substantially
affected by this feeding—all at .tho.
expense of the swimmer and canoer."
Dig a Well?
The entire area of the Stanford
campus consists of an underground
gravel layer. Below this gravel is a
vast watershed of water purified as
it passed through this gravel layer.
If one desired to sink a shaft for a
well, he could start at any point in
this area and hit water.
Two of the three sources for our
water on the campus are located
in the cactus garden and near the
convelescent home. In the old days
when the only water supply for irri
gation was on the other side of the
hills due to the larger amount of
rain, residents piped the water over
to their farms and homes.
Irrigates Too
At present, the water is drained
from the lake near the end of spring
for irrigation of some of the alfalfa
fields, while during the winter the
lake is filled with the surplus water
from the Searsville dam. Some sea
sons have passed in which little or
no water has drained into Lagunita
due to a scarcity of rain, but as you
well know, this winter was an ideal
one for the ducks.

convelescent home. In the old days
when the only water supply for irri
gation was on the other side of the
hills due to the larger amount of
rain, residents piped the water over
to their farms and homes.
Irrigates Too
At present, the water is drained
from the lake near the end of spring
for irrigation of some of the alfalfa
fields, while during the winter the
lake is filled with the surplus water
from the Searsville dam. Some sea
sons have passed in which little or
no water has drained into Lagunita
due to a scarcity of rain, but as you
well know, this winter was an ideal
one for the ducks.
It is said that Governor Stanford
had the present Lake Lagunita made
when, in the early eighties, he
ordered the ground excavated and
had the lake bed covered with clay,
thus correcting a porous condition
of the soil which previously had al
lowed the water to drain away as
soon as it collected.
The lake was originally planned
as an irrigation reservoir. The people
who first inhabited this region lived
in the hills where they were able
to procure water easily. As people
moved down from the hills onto the
flat lands they found that water for
irrigation was scarce due to the
porousness of the land. Water drain
ing from the hills onto this land
would soak into the ground leaving
no visible supply such as a lake or
stream.

| Plans were then developed for the
: excavation of a lake for irrigational
i purposes, thus forming Lagunita.
When the first attempt was made to
store water in it, the water drained
away through the porous soil of the
lake bottom.
To correct this condition, the lake
bed was completely covered with
tons of clay, and then sheep were
forced to mill around the bottom in
order to pack the clay. Water col
lected in the reservoir thus formed
' was used to irrigate 160 acres of
| alfalfa land, land now covered by
| the University.
Crew Discovers Lake
When Stanford came into exist
ence, some of the students discovered
that the lake would be an ideal loca
tion for crew meets. Some of the
athletes began climbing over the
fences to the lake in order to prac
tice. This crew activity soon gave
rise to interest among the students
for the establishment of the only
i boating and swimming center in the
I vicinity.
Previously, the crew had built a
small boathouse for the sheltering
of their boats, but this one was re
! placed by a second boathouse built
under the direction of the associated
j students.
Boathouse Collapses
This second boathouse collapsed
j during the spring water carnival and
! had to be replaced by the present
house. There were no serious in
juries as a result of this accident.
After the lake was established as
a swimming center, accidents such
as drownings occurred. This led to
the placing of lifeguards and the
drafting of precautionary measures
by the students in order to insure
•Safety of the swimmers and boaters.
Lake Lagunita was created by hol
lowing out the grpund and throw
ing up an embankment with the soil
so as to form a bowl to contain the
water. As the years passed the rains
would bring the rich sediments of
earth from the hills.
The Big Job
Residents in this area realized
j the value of this rich top soil and
; began to collect it during the sum
mers to replace the exhausted min
| erals of the soil around their
j homes. So popular had the lake bed
[ become for its prized soil, that the
people dug as far as the clay layer,
l and even began to remove some
of this clay. Dr. Banner, seeing that
the removal of this clay would un
cork the bottom of the lake, banned
the removal of any soil from the lake
i bed.
According to the Stanford Illus
! irated Review, ''Lagunita is one of
' the best examples of feeding ground
in the state. Three times the volume
of the lake percolates (soaks)
through each year to replenish the
water table. Actual experiments have
shown that all wells in the immedi
ate vicinity, and particularly those

of the University, are substantially
affected by this feeding—all at .tho.
expense of the swimmer and canoer."
Dig a Well?
The entire area of the Stanford
campus consists of an underground
gravel layer. Below this gravel is a
vast watershed of water purified as
it passed through this gravel layer.
If one desired to sink a shaft for a
well, he could start at any point in
this area and hit water.
Two of the three sources for our
water on the campus are located
in the cactus garden and near the
convelescent home. In the old days

water table. Actual experiments have
shown that all wells in the immedi
ate vicinity, and particularly those

of the University, are substantially

Dig a Well?
The entire area of the Stanford
campus consists of an underground
gravel layer. Below this gravel is a
vast watershed of water purified as
it passed through this gravel layer.
If one desired to sink a shaft for a
well, he could start at any point in
this area and hit water.
Two of the three sources for our
water on the campus are located
in the cactus garden and near the
convelescent home. In the old days
when the only water supply for irri
gation was on the other side of the
hills due to the larger amount of
rain, residents piped the water over
to their farms and homes.
Irrigates Too
At present, the water is drained
from the lake near the end of spring
for irrigation of some of the alfalfa
fields, while during the winter the
lake is filled with the surplus water
from the Searsville dam. Some sea
sons have passed in which little or
no water has drained into Lagunita
due to a scarcity of rain, but as you
well know, this winter was an ideal
one for the ducks.
It is said that Governor Stanford
had the present Lake Lagunita made
when, in the early eighties, he
ordered the ground excavated and
had the lake bed covered with clay,
thus correcting a porous condition
of the soil which previously had al
lowed the water to drain away as
soon as it collected.
The lake was originally planned
as an irrigation reservoir. The people
who first inhabited this region lived
in the hills where they were able
to procure water easily. As people
moved down from the hills onto the
flat lands they found that water for
irrigation was scarce due to the
porousness of the land. Water drain
ing from the hills onto this land
would soak into the ground leaving
no visible supply such as a lake or
stream.

| Plans were then developed for the
: excavation of a lake for irrigational
i purposes, thus forming Lagunita.
When the first attempt was made to
store water in it, the water drained
away through the porous soil of the
lake bottom.
To correct this condition, the lake
bed was completely covered with
tons of clay, and then sheep were
forced to mill around the bottom in
order to pack the clay. Water col
lected in the reservoir thus formed
' was used to irrigate 160 acres of
| alfalfa land, land now covered by
| the University.
Crew Discovers Lake
When Stanford came into exist
ence, some of the students discovered
that the lake would be an ideal loca
tion for crew meets. Some of the
athletes began climbing over the
fences to the lake in order to prac
tice. This crew activity soon gave
rise to interest among the students
for the establishment of the only
i boating and swimming center in the
I vicinity.
Previously, the crew had built a
small boathouse for the sheltering
of their boats, but this one was re
! placed by a second boathouse built
under the direction of the associated
j students.
Boathouse Collapses
This second boathouse collapsed
j during the spring water carnival and
! had to be replaced by the present
house. There were no serious in
juries as a result of this accident.
After the lake was established as
a swimming center, accidents such
as drownings occurred. This led to
the placing of lifeguards and the
drafting of precautionary measures
by the students in order to insure
•Safety of the swimmers and boaters.
Lake Lagunita was created by hol
lowing out the grpund and throw
ing up an embankment with the soil
so as to form a bowl to contain the
water. As the years passed the rains
would bring the rich sediments of
earth from the hills.
The Big Job
Residents in this area realized
j the value of this rich top soil and
; began to collect it during the sum
mers to replace the exhausted min
| erals of the soil around their
j homes. So popular had the lake bed
[ become for its prized soil, that the
people dug as far as the clay layer,
l and even began to remove some
of this clay. Dr. Banner, seeing that
the removal of this clay would un
cork the bottom of the lake, banned
the removal of any soil from the lake
i bed.
According to the Stanford Illus
! irated Review, ''Lagunita is one of
' the best examples of feeding ground
in the state. Three times the volume
of the lake percolates (soaks)
through each year to replenish the
water table. Actual experiments have
shown that all wells in the immedi
ate vicinity, and particularly those

of the University, are substantially
affected by this feeding—all at .tho.
expense of the swimmer and canoer."
