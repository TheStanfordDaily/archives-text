# Don't Trent Territory Like Money'--â€”Dr. Morgan
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Editorial note: This is one in our
series of post war articles. It is large
ly based on an informal interview
with Ur. B. O. Morgan, professor
of German. Dr. Morgan was at first
reluctant to he quoted, and did not
wish to he considered as having any
inside knowledge or special com
petence. His observations were based
on economic principles, generally ac
ccptcd laws of human nature, and
his personal acquaintance with Ger
many and the Germans.
There is no surer way to lose the
peace than to demand huge German
reparations' and territorial conces
sions.
German Resentment
Territory cannot be treated like
money. German people are living on
the land we so carelessly propose
giving to one country or another.
They will resent being driven from
their homes, and will want to regain
them, by vvar 112 lecessary.
Experience has showed that repar
ations counted in billions are im
practical. Germany could pay them
in three ways: (1) Gold or raw ma
terials, (2) Labor, (3) Manufactured
products. Gold is out of the question,
because Germany has very little and
raw materials are also unadequate.
Russia is the only nation that has
considered taking labor. That leaves
only the manufactured products to
reckon with.
Flood of Produce
Wc can't accept these in large
amounts because they would ruin
our economy. Our manufacturers
would be driven out of business by
a flood of free produce from Ger
many. We are protecting them with
tariff harriers to prevent >ust such
competition from other foreign
countries.
Besides the practical difficulties of
collecting and using German repara
tions, we must consider what the
Germans themselves would think. If
they felt they were being punished
unjustly their resentment would lead
toward war. Unless they themselves
believe they are being treated fairly,
they will not consider the peace
permanent.
Reparation Unjust
Any long range reparation would
be considered unjust. For years the
German people have been helpless
under a ruthless police system. If
they protested against Hitler and
his ideas, the government shot their
sisters and mothers. Most of them
have been victims rather than ex
ponents of the Hitler regime. The
leaders should be punished, but the
people cannot be considered guilty.

Nazism has been blamed for its
I habit of shooting hostages, and
punishing the innocent for the guilty.
We would be doing that same thing
j in demanding long range reparation.
I Germans who aren't yet born might
| eventually have to share in these
payments, and they wouldn't under
stand why.
Peace Settlements
"Whatever form the peace-settle
ments may take," said Dr. Mox-gan,
"they will be no more effective or
lasting than the terms of the Treaty
of Versailles if they do not offer
j the German people the prospect of
1 a self-respecting international role,
j along with a satisfactory intra
: national economic future.
"If our peace-makers have the

wisdom and the courage to write
such provisions into law, I am confi
dent that those sound elements in the
German people which Hitlerism has
not been able to corrupt will espouse
the new program and, with the sup- j
port of public opinion outside Ger
many, it will succeed in redirecting
the energies of the Germans away j
from world-conquest and into more
useful paths.
