It happened in tlic* Alain Libe last week. Several Stanford women,
noticing a nice-looking, dark-haired Marine standing hy the exhibit of
Cpl. Fred Saunders" war souvenirs, struck up a conversation with him.
"The "wise" Farm women, having read Cii 1 Wheat's interview with Cpl.
Saunders in last Thursday's Dippy, thought they'd show off their knowl-

edge and proceeded to tell the in- ♦
terested Marine all about Cpl. Saun
ders' war exploits at Guadalcanal,
Peleliu, and Cape Gloucester.
Embroidering more than slightly
on the facts, and filling in parts of
the story to make it sound even bet
ter than the Daily article read, the j
women proceeded to list a few places
that Saunders had never even seen.
The Marine, becoming more th n
interested in the mircaculous feats
of the apparently one-man war ma
chine, was a good listener.
After the women left, the Marine
took another look at the souvenirs,
his souvenirs, and had a good long
laugh to himself. The Farm women
don't know until now that the in
terested Marine was one Cpl. Fred
Saunders of Guadalcanal and Pele
liu fame, home on furlough.
