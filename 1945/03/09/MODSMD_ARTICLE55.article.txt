# Chappie Is Out Next Week, One of the Best Say Staff
## 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
"Out next week! Out next week! Out next week!" screamed Old Boy
Dick Driscoll, giving your reporter the inside dope as to when the big
March Chaparral will appear on Quad.
"The March Chaparral will be bigger und better than ever and will
contain many s| ecial features including stories, cartoons and advertise
ments," he said. "Everybody should <

buy a dozen or .so copies to send to
friends and relatives in the service,"

he added.
Biz AT a n ager
Bill Gilbert,
known affection
ately by the edi
torial staff as
"Little Shylock,"
told your report
er that as usual,
the Chappie will
be .sold at odd
places all over

Quad at the regular price of 25 cents.
"This lioakum about new low price
of 25 cents is just editorial staff

j propaganda. Don't believe it,"he
j juiped.
Next on your reporter's list was
Managing Editor Barney Gugel who
made the statement, "If you want to
read something good, read the Open
er poem which I wrote. Not to brag
or anything, it's really great. It
, should at least rank along with the
| better works of Milton and Goethe.
! Here read it."
Your reporter read it, and then,
! fighting back a rising bird, moved
| on to the office of Bob Breer, art
editor.
j Art to Rival Leonardo
Breer stated, "If you want to see
something good, look at this page
which I drew. Not to brag or any
thing, it's really great. It will rank
with the great works of Leonardo
and El Greco. Here look at it."
Fighting back another feathered
friend, your reporter returned to
Dick Driscoll who told her to print
a story in The Daily telling about
| the Big Story contest ending Sun
â–  day night, and the 15 dollar prize,
I and that the contest is open to all
: Stanford st u dents except regular
| contributors and staff members of
ihe Chaparral.
Turning down Driscoll's request on
! the grounds that everybody knows
| about the contest already, your re
porter returned to the safety of The
Daily Shack.
