# 'Unified Stanford' Housing Group Aim
## 
### 
Women's Housing Committee, in
its last meeting open for general
debate, heard a plan yesterday
based on straight lot system that,
according to its sponsor, Frances
Jennings, has as its objectives the
promotion of a "unified Stanford
community wherein each living
group will feel that it is a part of
a whole co-operative effort," and
facilitation of "congeniality within
a residence so that each woman may
feel herself a part of a friendly
group."
The plan, which differs basically
frqpi the housing plan presented
last Tuesday only in the exclusion
of a living unit preference list, in
cluded:
1. Establishment of a social pro
gram throughout the year to en
able the freshmen to see the inside
of all women's residences and en
able freshmen and upper classmen
to become more than casually ac
quainted; and to allow them to min
gle freely in order that freshmen
may decide where they would be
the most happy the following year
and so that the upper class women
may become acquainted with indi
viduals in the freshman class.
2. Publication during spring quar
ter of a list of vacancies which will
occur in each living group the fol
lowing quarter.
3. Recommendation that during

the first part of spring quarter up
per classmen be given the oppor
tunity to make any changes which
they desire.
4. Indication of preferences for
future living group by freshman
women later in spring quarter. Res
idences to be listea in three sections,
Lagunita, Union Residence, and Row,
for clarity. Freshmen could list five
preferences and it would not be
necessary to keep within one unit.
At this same time each fresh
man would draw a number; those
with the lowest numbers would be
mgst likely to get their first prefer
ence. The size of the number a
freshman drew plus the number of
vacancies occurring in the residences
would determine her final place
ment. A recommendation was made
that freshmen be allowed to draw in
pairs.
4. Independence of living group
policy to decide room assignments.
5. Provision for some kind of ac
tivity before the end of spring quar
ter in order to welcome the incom
ing group.
6. Recommendation that adequate
provision be made for moving after
any quarter, under the room draw
ing system.
7. Recommendation that transfers
should be proportioned among vari
ous living groups individually.
Also recommended in the plan

was the formation of a permanent
student advisory committee to co
ordinate social policy; to act as a
clearing house between the resi
dences and the University staff,
thereby giving flexibility to class
ratios and other administration; and
to carry forward efforts to promote
congeniality in each living group.
Group spirit may be organized and
maintained, according to the plan,
by leadership forums and educa
tion welcome of the new girls by
the old, spreading of responsibility,
anpreciation for group service, and
attention to individual problems.
Presenting the advantages of the
plan over those previously discussed,
Miss Jennings pointed out that un
der this system there would be no
objection to upper classmen visiting
the freshman halls and friendly and
natural relations between old and
new women would be encouraged.
The necessity for a secret com
mittee is eliminated, thereby elimi
nating personal hard feelings and
allowing freshmen to feel that the
choice of the living group is up to
them.
There will be a natural and desir
able tendency for individual girls
or groups of girls to try to get into
a living group in which they have
seen a general attitude and way of
living which appeals to them.
This will provide a nucleus of

compatible girls who will be able
to assimilate any disinterested in- i
dividuals and who will eventually
be able to produce a friendly and
unified group. The present plan,
Miss Jennings said, will provide this
compatible nucleus, and it distrib
utes girls who arc not interested in i
the group evenly over the campus.
Summarizing the spirit of the plan, j
Miss Jennings said, "The plan is
oriented forward; it does not seek j
to return exclusively to any existing j
or old method. It invites the for- j
mulation of a new social policy j
which will both unite all women's
living groups and provide a happy
way of living for each Stanford |
woman."
Reporting on the work of a sub
committee appointed to draw up a
social program, Marylou McClure
suggested that open houses be held
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, April
13, 14, and 15, from 2 to 5. Fresh
men would be divided into groups
and given an opportunity to be- j
come familiar with different types j
of living groups.
Final decisions on housing plans
will be made at later meetings be
fore the end of the quarter, accord
ing to Chairman Sally Breuner. The
committee will submit its decisions
j to the administration; women will j
j be informed of final policies.
