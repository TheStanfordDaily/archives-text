Warning yesterday that Stanford
was SI,IOO short of its $3,000 goal in
the current Red Cross drive, that
fighting Indian spirit forged ahead
today to give all of SI 19.70 to help
make up the deficit.
With a total now of 52,034.75,
Stanford students must contribute
nearly one thousand dollars by 5
this afternoon if they expect Stan
ford to fulfill its quota.

Four living groups and two indi
vidual contributors did their bit to
ward keeping their pledge to the
Red Cross yesterday. They were
Lathrop House (100 per cent). $54;
Branner 2E. $25; Branner 2W, $14.50;
Roble 18, $31.50; Victor Ricketts, j
$3; and an anonymous contributor, j
$2.
Charmian Kolar, chairman of the 1
drive, asked every living group to j
keep on soliciting for money and to I
turn it in to Treasurer Franky Mc-
Innis at the A.S.S.U. office. Her of- |
fice hours are from 3 to 5. All money J
must be turned in by then.
Collections from off-campus stu
dents or those who have not yet con
tributed will be taken in front of
the Cellar today from 10 to 11 and
from 12 to 1. announced Miss Kolar.
