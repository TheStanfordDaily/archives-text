# Class Representatives, Faculty Boast Olympic Day Abilities
## FROSH 
### 
Optimism has definitely thrown }
defeatism out of the freshman camp j
according to flash reports last night
from frosh hdqs. Cries of "It's in the
bag! Olympic day is ours! With Mol
lendorf, Sally Such, Frankie Brown, j
Mary Stafford, Schwaneflugel and
495 other women screaming for us
in the stands, we can do anything!"
"The class of '48 are really ac
centuating the positive and elimi
nating the negative," frosh prexy
Morley Thompson said. "The Bran
ner-Ventura-R oble -Toyon-Tyler-
Buchanan axis has developed a
steam-roller offense that will ride
the other classes right out of the
Sunken diamond."
Class of '48 colors are green and !
frosh representatives are urging !
every freshman to get decked out j
in their best green sweaters and j
jeans. As some misguided dope put
it, "Let's get out there and show :
'em our dust. Scream your lungs out i
and yell our new fight cry:
"We're likkered up,
We're going to town
The Class of '48
Will mow 'em down."
