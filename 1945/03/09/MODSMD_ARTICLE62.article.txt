Who says that we Sophs arc soft?
We're the class which averages 12
hours of sleep per week; the class
which hashes, plays footsie, drinks
Coca-Cola, and understands the
Chappie ;iokes.
Furthermore, we of '47 are the
guys 'n gals who've got speed. Run

us doing our Fulton Flips on the
way to room 100 at 8:12 a.m. You've
marvelled at our technique in mak
ing the P.O. before and after each
class, even in the middle of some

Boathouse and at the "Phantom Em

So, why not come to the Sunken
