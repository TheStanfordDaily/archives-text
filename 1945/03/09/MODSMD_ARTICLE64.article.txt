With the greatest assemblage of
mentality ever found in a junior
class, at tomorrow's Olympic Day
festivities the spirits of 46 will again
prove the age old adage of brains
over brawn.
Spurred on by the slogan, "Mix
with 4(>," we have been training for
weeks. Any day one might have seen
such junior notables as "Moo" Mc-
Clure doing setting up exercises be
tween classes or in the ASSU of
fice, thus getting in the best of
condition for the great marathon.
Also, our faces are blue (in keeping
with junior colors) from pumping
bicycles up the boathouse hill.
In view of the strokes of genius
and the supreme efforts which the
spirits of 46 have shown, the Grand
Board of Junior Strategy has stated:
"We're set! We're sharp! We're a
synch to clynch in a pinch!"
