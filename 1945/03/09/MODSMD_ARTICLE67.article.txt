# True Issue of Peace Plan Success, Says Buck
## 
### 
"Just pour a cup of tea in me,"
said Dr. Philip Buck in his discus
sion of world pcace to the YWCA
World Affairs Group yesterday,"and
this speech will come out: I've given
it so often."
Dr. Buck outlined the proposed
charter planned at Dumbarton Oaks,
and soon to be voted on at the com
ing United Nations meeting in San
Francisco.
The plan, hoped to become the
working peace charter for the United
Nations, consists of: (1) an assembly
of all states, each with one vote; (2)
a security council in the character
of a committee, which will have five
permanent members made up of the
Hig Four, and France in due course,
and six temporary members elected
two for a year, two for two years,
and two for three years, by the as
sembly from the smaller states; (:>)
a secretariat elected by the assembly
with a skilled staff of historians, ac
countants, etc., under a secretary
general; (4) an international court
corresponding in many ways to that
of the League; (5) an economic and
social council elected by the as
sembly, probably from the big in
industrial states.
The peace this time will have the
advantage of having the League mis
takes to refer to and attempt to pre

vent. The League implied an obliga
tion to apply economic sanctions or
military sanctions against the aggres
sor nation.
The Dumbarton Oaks proposes a
j military staff, members coinciding
with the countries of the security
council, each member nation con
tributing airplanes to bases under
general control of the assembly. This
is in peacetime. In an emergency,
J each country is pledged to deliver
more material; the member nation
nearest the trouble required to de
liver the most.
Too many people, emphasized Dr.
Buck, consider the problem of the
Oaks proposal to be the voting pro
cedure of the assembly. This is
wrong. The true issue is whether or
not communities will cooperate, and
the answer to this lies in what the
United States will do.
We must be prepared far in ad
vance for the next war, for we will
not be able to do what we have done
for the last two timesâ€”get ready at
the last minute.
Whether or not there will be an
other war should make no difference
to our entering a world association.
| If it is a first-power war, we will
be drawn in if we are not in the
association. If we are in the associ
ation we at least have a chance to
, attempt to prevent it when the trou
ble is first brewing.
