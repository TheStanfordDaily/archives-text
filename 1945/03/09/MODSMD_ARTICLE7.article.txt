"When they say of this generation, "Oh, they'll never solve
! their problems," they'd better look to their laurels. For if yes
terday's housing meeting is any indication of the way in which
| this generation goes at its really touchy problems then they
1 won't be seeing us for dust.
The quiet, dispassionate, reasonable manner in which people
1 discussed plans that had taken them hours of heated discussion
and sweat of the brow to formulate—plans that were indeed
1 their children—was enough to rejoice the heart.
B. J. Calfee's attitude that "what the freshmen want is what
we must do; we don't count any more," although the just-quoted
freshman opinion was against her own plan, the plan which had
started student interest, concern, and hard thinking like a torch
to a bonfire . . . Fran Jennings answering all objections to her
plan quietly, slowly, entirely without high pressure . . . the
whole discussion group taking time out on occasion to laugh
at itself or at seme joke from the back of the room . . . the mas
terful, sympathetic, directed handling which Sally Breuner as
chairman gave to the discussion . . . All these would make us
i say, "Maybe we won't solve 'em all exactly, but it will be a
long day before you'll see people with a better attitude for solv
! ing them."—Nancy Tilden
