"The safety of the Republic must
rest upon the educated intelligence
of the people," said Senator Ice
land Stanford when he announced
his plans for the building of a
university in memory of his son, i
Leland Stanford. Jr.
Leland Stanford Junior Univer-1
sity was officially founded hv a
grant on November 14, I<SB5; but
it wasn't until October 1. 18 ( H, that
its doors were formally opened to
the first students to join the Stan
ford Family.
The founding of Stanford Uni
versity was a difficult undertaking.
It was opposed by influential men
who insisted that California had
too many universities already and
could not afford to support a pri
vate institution. But Leland Stan
ford and Jane Lathrop Stanford,
his wife, saw it through, to found;
a University where education would
be available to all—a University
which recognized no racial, social,
or religious lines; and a University
which would and could give an
equal education to aspiring stu
dents with little or no money.
These, briefly, were the ideals
of the founders of Stanford Uni
versity. Today, Stanford students
celebrate the fifty-first Founders'
Day in commemoration of the birth
day of Lcland Stanford, Jr.
The first Founders' Day took
place on March 9. 1894, less than a
year after the death of Senator
Stanford. It was intended as a me
morial service for him and in
cluded a program of music and ad
dresses. Among the speakers at this
first Founders' Day celebration
were the Hon. Horace Davis: Prof.
Augustus T. Murray, one of Stan
ford's earliest faculty members;
President David Starr Jordan; the
Rt. Rev. Joseph J. Keane; Prof.
Alphonse <1. Newcomer, also an
early faculty member, who deliv
ered a memorial ode to Leland Stan- j
ford, Jr.: and the Hon. Benjamin!
Harrison, ex - President of the
United States.
During the first years of its ex
istence. Stanford University was
often in peril of being closed. Mrs.
Stanford, after the death of her j
husband, fought almost alone to
keep the University open, and all
but a \ cry small amount of her
personal income was given to the
University in order that it might
stay open. Faced by the panic of
1893 and a government suit for
fifteen million dollars against the
University, she kept the school open j
with only the support of her broth- j
er. Charles Lathrop, who told her.]
"You haven't got your hack up |
against the wall yet. Keep the Uni- j
versity open until you do."
As a note to war-weary females, 1
Mrs. Stanford doubted the advisa-i
bilitv of coeducation and for a while
seriously considered establishing a
separate girls' college adjacent to 1
Stanford itself. However, she tie- I
cided against it. leaving the prob- 1
lent up to the decision of the Board
of Trustees.
By 19(H) the bounders' Day pro
gram had shown a change from the i
original in that the musical selec

liam Smith, and also mentioned the
senior class as part of the Founders'
Day activities. The annual banquet
was held that year at the St. Fran
cis 1 lotel in the city.
David Starr Jordan, by then
Chancellor of the University, gave
the address for the 1915 Founders'
Day program, speaking on " The
Foundation Ideals of Stanford Uni
versity. The annual banquets had
moved to Stanford, a previous one
having been given at Fncina Hal!
and this one at the Women's Club
house.
The University of California
spirit was at Stanford in promi
nence for March 'K 1916. The pro
tions on the program were much
more numerous. There were sev
eral classical selections offered and
a considerable lessening of the
number of speeches given.
The first annual Founders' Day
banquet was held in l'Jll for the
Stanford Alumni Association, and

was given at the Palace Hotel in
San Francisco. It included an elab-
orate menu printed in gilt lettering.
In 1912 the program for Found-
ers' Day included for the first time
the Stanford Hymn, by Albert Wil-
gram included not only the Cal
hymn, but the address was deliv-
ered by President Benjamin Ide
W heeler of the University of Cali
fornia.
Starting in 1921, a series of sa
cred concerts were given as part
of the Founders' Day proceedings.
These concerts were given in the
Memorial Church by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra and in-
cluded religious music and once the
Haydn oratorio, "The Creation."
This practice continued through
1932, when it became one of more
Stanford participation, a custom
which has continued until now.
Since the war, the accent has
been on preserving the spirit and
ideals of Stanford in the stress of
war, as was evidenced by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur's address on "Stan-
ford Traditions" at last year's cere-
monies. |

or religious lines; and a University
which would and could give an
equal education to aspiring stu
dents with little or no money.
These, briefly, were the ideals
of the founders of Stanford Uni
versity. Today, Stanford students
celebrate the fifty-first Founders'
Day in commemoration of the birth
day of Lcland Stanford, Jr.
The first Founders' Day took
place on March 9. 1894, less than a
year after the death of Senator
Stanford. It was intended as a me
morial service for him and in
cluded a program of music and ad
dresses. Among the speakers at this
first Founders' Day celebration
were the Hon. Horace Davis: Prof.
Augustus T. Murray, one of Stan
ford's earliest faculty members;
President David Starr Jordan; the
Rt. Rev. Joseph J. Keane; Prof.
Alphonse <1. Newcomer, also an
early faculty member, who deliv
ered a memorial ode to Leland Stan- j
ford, Jr.: and the Hon. Benjamin!
Harrison, ex - President of the
United States.
During the first years of its ex
istence. Stanford University was
often in peril of being closed. Mrs.
Stanford, after the death of her j
husband, fought almost alone to
keep the University open, and all
but a \ cry small amount of her
personal income was given to the
University in order that it might
stay open. Faced by the panic of
1893 and a government suit for
fifteen million dollars against the
University, she kept the school open j
with only the support of her broth- j
er. Charles Lathrop, who told her.]
"You haven't got your hack up |
against the wall yet. Keep the Uni- j
versity open until you do."
As a note to war-weary females, 1
Mrs. Stanford doubted the advisa-i
bilitv of coeducation and for a while
seriously considered establishing a
separate girls' college adjacent to 1
Stanford itself. However, she tie- I
cided against it. leaving the prob- 1
lent up to the decision of the Board
of Trustees.
By 19(H) the bounders' Day pro
gram had shown a change from the i
original in that the musical selec

liam Smith, and also mentioned the
senior class as part of the Founders'
Day activities. The annual banquet
was held that year at the St. Fran
cis 1 lotel in the city.
David Starr Jordan, by then
Chancellor of the University, gave
the address for the 1915 Founders'
Day program, speaking on " The
Foundation Ideals of Stanford Uni
versity. The annual banquets had
moved to Stanford, a previous one
having been given at Fncina Hal!
and this one at the Women's Club
house.
The University of California
spirit was at Stanford in promi
nence for March 'K 1916. The pro
tions on the program were much
more numerous. There were sev
eral classical selections offered and
a considerable lessening of the
number of speeches given.
The first annual Founders' Day
banquet was held in l'Jll for the
Stanford Alumni Association, and

was given at the Palace Hotel in
San Francisco. It included an elab-
orate menu printed in gilt lettering.
In 1912 the program for Found-
ers' Day included for the first time
the Stanford Hymn, by Albert Wil-
gram included not only the Cal
hymn, but the address was deliv-
ered by President Benjamin Ide
W heeler of the University of Cali
fornia.
Starting in 1921, a series of sa
cred concerts were given as part
of the Founders' Day proceedings.
These concerts were given in the
Memorial Church by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra and in-
cluded religious music and once the
Haydn oratorio, "The Creation."
This practice continued through
1932, when it became one of more
Stanford participation, a custom
which has continued until now.
Since the war, the accent has
been on preserving the spirit and
ideals of Stanford in the stress of
war, as was evidenced by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur's address on "Stan-
ford Traditions" at last year's cere-
monies. |
"The safety of the Republic must
rest upon the educated intelligence
of the people," said Senator Ice
land Stanford when he announced
his plans for the building of a
university in memory of his son, i
Leland Stanford. Jr.
Leland Stanford Junior Univer-1
sity was officially founded hv a
grant on November 14, I<SB5; but
it wasn't until October 1. 18 ( H, that
its doors were formally opened to
the first students to join the Stan
ford Family.
The founding of Stanford Uni
versity was a difficult undertaking.
It was opposed by influential men
who insisted that California had
too many universities already and
could not afford to support a pri
vate institution. But Leland Stan
ford and Jane Lathrop Stanford,
his wife, saw it through, to found;
a University where education would
be available to all—a University
which recognized no racial, social,
or religious lines; and a University
which would and could give an

During the first years of its ex
istence. Stanford University was
often in peril of being closed. Mrs.
Stanford, after the death of her j
husband, fought almost alone to
keep the University open, and all
but a \ cry small amount of her
personal income was given to the
University in order that it might
stay open. Faced by the panic of
1893 and a government suit for
fifteen million dollars against the
University, she kept the school open j
with only the support of her broth- j
er. Charles Lathrop, who told her.]
"You haven't got your hack up |
against the wall yet. Keep the Uni- j
versity open until you do."
As a note to war-weary females, 1
Mrs. Stanford doubted the advisa-i
bilitv of coeducation and for a while
seriously considered establishing a
separate girls' college adjacent to 1
Stanford itself. However, she tie- I
cided against it. leaving the prob- 1
lent up to the decision of the Board
of Trustees.
By 19(H) the bounders' Day pro
gram had shown a change from the i
original in that the musical selec

liam Smith, and also mentioned the
senior class as part of the Founders'
Day activities. The annual banquet
was held that year at the St. Fran
cis 1 lotel in the city.
David Starr Jordan, by then
Chancellor of the University, gave
the address for the 1915 Founders'
Day program, speaking on " The
Foundation Ideals of Stanford Uni
versity. The annual banquets had
moved to Stanford, a previous one
having been given at Fncina Hal!
and this one at the Women's Club
house.
The University of California
spirit was at Stanford in promi
nence for March 'K 1916. The pro
tions on the program were much
more numerous. There were sev
eral classical selections offered and
a considerable lessening of the
number of speeches given.
The first annual Founders' Day
banquet was held in l'Jll for the
Stanford Alumni Association, and

was given at the Palace Hotel in
San Francisco. It included an elab-
orate menu printed in gilt lettering.
In 1912 the program for Found-
ers' Day included for the first time
the Stanford Hymn, by Albert Wil-
gram included not only the Cal
hymn, but the address was deliv-
ered by President Benjamin Ide
W heeler of the University of Cali
fornia.
Starting in 1921, a series of sa
cred concerts were given as part
of the Founders' Day proceedings.
These concerts were given in the
Memorial Church by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra and in-
cluded religious music and once the
Haydn oratorio, "The Creation."
This practice continued through
1932, when it became one of more
Stanford participation, a custom
which has continued until now.
Since the war, the accent has
been on preserving the spirit and
ideals of Stanford in the stress of
war, as was evidenced by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur's address on "Stan-
ford Traditions" at last year's cere-
monies. |
"The safety of the Republic must
rest upon the educated intelligence
of the people," said Senator Ice
land Stanford when he announced
his plans for the building of a
university in memory of his son, i
Leland Stanford. Jr.
Leland Stanford Junior Univer-1
sity was officially founded hv a
grant on November 14, I<SB5; but
it wasn't until October 1. 18 ( H, that
its doors were formally opened to
the first students to join the Stan
ford Family.
The founding of Stanford Uni
versity was a difficult undertaking.
It was opposed by influential men
who insisted that California had
too many universities already and
could not afford to support a pri
vate institution. But Leland Stan
ford and Jane Lathrop Stanford,
his wife, saw it through, to found;
a University where education would
be available to all—a University
which recognized no racial, social,
or religious lines; and a University
which would and could give an
equal education to aspiring stu
dents with little or no money.
These, briefly, were the ideals
of the founders of Stanford Uni
versity. Today, Stanford students
celebrate the fifty-first Founders'
Day in commemoration of the birth
day of Lcland Stanford, Jr.
The first Founders' Day took
place on March 9. 1894, less than a
year after the death of Senator
Stanford. It was intended as a me
morial service for him and in
cluded a program of music and ad
dresses. Among the speakers at this
first Founders' Day celebration
were the Hon. Horace Davis: Prof.
Augustus T. Murray, one of Stan
ford's earliest faculty members;
President David Starr Jordan; the
Rt. Rev. Joseph J. Keane; Prof.
Alphonse <1. Newcomer, also an
early faculty member, who deliv
ered a memorial ode to Leland Stan- j
