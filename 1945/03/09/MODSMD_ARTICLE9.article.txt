# FOREFATHERS STRUGGLED.
## Writing Headlines Difficult 1890 Then as Now, but They Were Used to It. 
### 
In these live columns oi the
j Daily's front page you will find this
1 morning an edition of the Daily
! Palo Alto brought to you as a spe
| cial service for Founders' Day.
This is the sort of paper our
j grandpa's and ma's—there were a
I few—opened of a bright March
i day. just before finals, in the late
1890's. For the Daily has been
around, hitting the streets at more
or less irregular intervals, since a
few short years after the Founders
had done their founding back in
1891.
Of course it's a well-known fact
that the campus without a Dippy,
the Peninsula's only morning news
paper. would be the ship without a
sail, the man without a woman, the 1

bird without a wing, of all good
song and legend.
But all kidding aside, we hope
you enjoy a look at the way they
did things then and will hold a few
moments of silent sympathy for
our forefathers struggling with
those "pyramid" heads.
