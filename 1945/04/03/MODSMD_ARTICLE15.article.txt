# SPRING CLEANING
## 
### 
There may not be a ratio . . . there may not
be sports . . . there may not be gasoline . . .
but there is always spring at Stanford. Spring
is traditionally the time for cleaning up of study
habits, old incompletes lying around, and for
plusses that we should have gone heretofore.
Seniors start remembering that at this time,
or at any other time next year, they won't be
back. Friend Eisenhower is doing his spring
cleaning around Berlin. And cleaning is also
being done by General Buckner et al. just be
low Tokyo.
Just a few miles away the United Nations are
going about their spring cleaning of the much
discussed, touted, and cynically awaited "peace
plans." The excitement of the local papers is
soured by the general statements of Washing
ton about its scope and personnel.
Stanford's own whirl of politics will have to
slip into a higher gear to get the reorganized
Excom elected next month.
And to get into the spirit of things . . . we
might as well start a spring cleaning of ideas
we've had about 1945 as a year for a "lasting
peace."
Looking over the plans of a few years ago, it
seems incredible to find us facing this peace
with so many of the same ideas that we have
assailed for creating World War 11. It is unin
spiring to say how far we have come, for with
one strange name after another screaming for
its place in the headlines, this year might be
'44, '46, or anything. The eternity of war has
cleared our heads of illusions perhaps, but it
has cleared them of the vision of many past mis
takes also. If we attributed mistakes both to
the policies of Wilson and to those of Clemen
ceau, and we still seem to be divided between
them, essentially, we now have improved less
upon Wilson. It seems strange and sad that
such a bitter lesson should be lost so soon.
But far from prewar plans for a strong world
organization with force and democratic repre
sentation, we are balancing the future peace of
the world on the amity of huge states, in which
the dissent of a single member would plunge
us all into war.
The general method has degenerated into one
of closed conferences for "blueprints" and se
lect telephone conversations for the settling of
controversies which have burned in historical
cauldrons for generations. We are creating a
conceivable monstrosity, dependent on the
good will of men, by geography and history di
vided in history and ideas, rather than depend
ent upon laws made for the assurance of justice.
Our thinking needs revising in so far as we
must remember that the San Francisco meet
has no power to question most of this essen
tial framework. "Questions of bprders, war rep
arations, peace terms, dependent nations . . . are
not going to be settled at San Francisco," ac
cording to the Chronicle's State Department
sources. "These questions will be discussed
but only obliquely and only in so far as their
discussion as hypothetical cases can contribute
to the establishment of a charter."
This conference is described as "the constitu
tional convention of the world."
This is not reassuring when everything will
depend upon the interpretation and elaboration
Df these plans. Too much of the current inter
pretation has been along the line of least re
sistance, and bolder plans seem dreams of long
ago.
So we might as well take mop and brooms in

this spring cleaning to our ideas about world
peace. We are back at the beginning, we are
judging reparations, punishment of war crimi
nals, all over again; it is reasonable to expect
that these issues will be with us for some time.
It is, perhaps, a hard spring all over, and
there is not too much time before the ideas of
our generation will have to make a future of
this bargainâ€”this among other things that while
away the spring.
