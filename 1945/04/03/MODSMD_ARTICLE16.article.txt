# HISTORY-1945

### Elliot Epsteen 
The battle of the Rhine is over, and 1,000,000 men
are across. The German position is now hopeless. Even
if they can organize a line inland, the key raw materials
located in the Saar, the Ruhr and Silesia have fallen,
along with much of the industry necessary to keep an
army going. The Germans might have had a chance
in a hundred if this war was the 18th Century, but none
now.
We are witnessing the end play of the European war.
What has happened and what will are the elements of
the most dramatic history in 1945.
; KAMAGEN
The first breech in the enemy defenses came at Ra
magen. Our destruction of the German center was so
complete during the battle of the Siegrried line that,
by the time we reached the Rhine, the east bank was
only spottily guarded. We got across the river at Rama
gen, but Von Rundstedt, then commander of the Ger
man forces, got reserves up and plugged the gap.
General Hodges, commanding in this sector, could
have completed his breakthrough, pushing on inland
after a fierce battle. But the <snemy was very well post
ed in the hills behind the bridgehead, and Supreme
Headquarters probably turned thumbs down on any
serious attempt in this area, for the time being. There
were less bloody ways of whining.
Hodges managed to rest his center on a ridge be
fore the German reserves got up, making it very strong
defensively. Now, free from worry about a counterat
tack aimed at that part of his line, he expanded his
flanks north and south, lengthening his line. Von Kcs
selring, who took command shortly after he established
his bridgehead, could only plug new units into his lines
around it for fear that either his flank would be turned
or his lines would be stretched too thin.
SAAK
Now practically all of the German reserves were
either tied down at Ramagen or in second line on the
Westphalian plain, awaiting the attack of Field-Marshal
Sir Bernard Montgomery's three armies. General Ei
senhower decided to open an offensive in a new quarter,
cracking the difficult southern end of the front.
This was perhaps the strongest sector of the Sieg
fried Line. Its right covered by the Moselle and its
left in the Vosges, its center, around Saarbrucken, had
held off all frontal attacks launched by both Generals
Patch and Patton.
Now that Patton was operating to its north, however,
and had broken through to Coblentz, the German units
covering the right wing of the seemingly attack-proof
compartment, had to hold about a hundred miles of
river front as compared with only 20 or 30 previously.
They were much too weak for their new task, and
things were in such a dangerous condition everyplace
else that they could not be reinforced.
RAMAGEN BRIDGEHEAD
General Patton, who had now consolidated his
breakthrough, suddenly crossed the Moselle with two
armored divisions and 18 attached tank batallions, ut
terly smashing the thin German line. At the same time,
General Hodges extended his Ramagen bridgehead to
cut the Autobahn linking Frankfort and Cologne, thus
effectively separating the two German wings.
The Germans in the south made ap immediate re
treat. They should have pulled out long before, but
Corporal Hitler had made a stand or die order Their
retrograde movement was too late, as General Patton
took Kaiserlautern, controlling their lines of march, and
effectively annihalated them.
Now there was nothing on the German southern
wing. Patton pushed to Mainz and crossed the Rhine
against light opposition, moving northwards. Marshal
Montgomery, attacking with landing boats and behind
a withering artillery barrage, crossed north of the Ruhr.
WESTPHALIAN PLAINS
The troops the enemy had on the Westphalian plain
were more numerous than in any other sector, but they
were too weak to deal with both Montgomery and Pat
ton in detail. Thus retreat was the only course open
to the enemy, because if he tried to stand along the
Rhine, General Patton might work around his rear
and a debacle would occur on a scale making the Saar
battle look like a patrol action.
The retreat was as orderly as possible, but not or
derly enough. M;iYiy rearguards were sacrificed, includ
ing one of 50,000 men in the Ruhr, although this, too,
might have been the victim of a Hitlerian "stand or die"
order.
Now the enemy is in full retreat towards the Weser.

They were much too weak for their new task, and
things were in such a dangerous condition everyplace
else that they could not be reinforced.
RAMAGEN BRIDGEHEAD
General Patton, who had now consolidated his
breakthrough, suddenly crossed the Moselle with two
armored divisions and 18 attached tank batallions, ut
terly smashing the thin German line. At the same time,
General Hodges extended his Ramagen bridgehead to
cut the Autobahn linking Frankfort and Cologne, thus
effectively separating the two German wings.
The Germans in the south made ap immediate re
treat. They should have pulled out long before, but
Corporal Hitler had made a stand or die order Their
retrograde movement was too late, as General Patton
took Kaiserlautern, controlling their lines of march, and
effectively annihalated them.
Now there was nothing on the German southern
wing. Patton pushed to Mainz and crossed the Rhine
against light opposition, moving northwards. Marshal
Montgomery, attacking with landing boats and behind
a withering artillery barrage, crossed north of the Ruhr.
WESTPHALIAN PLAINS
The troops the enemy had on the Westphalian plain
were more numerous than in any other sector, but they
were too weak to deal with both Montgomery and Pat
ton in detail. Thus retreat was the only course open
to the enemy, because if he tried to stand along the
Rhine, General Patton might work around his rear
and a debacle would occur on a scale making the Saar
battle look like a patrol action.
The retreat was as orderly as possible, but not or
derly enough. M;iYiy rearguards were sacrificed, includ
ing one of 50,000 men in the Ruhr, although this, too,
might have been the victim of a Hitlerian "stand or die"
order.
Now the enemy is in full retreat towards the Weser.

; KAMAGEN
The first breech in the enemy defenses came at Ra
magen. Our destruction of the German center was so
complete during the battle of the Siegrried line that,
by the time we reached the Rhine, the east bank was
only spottily guarded. We got across the river at Rama
gen, but Von Rundstedt, then commander of the Ger
man forces, got reserves up and plugged the gap.
General Hodges, commanding in this sector, could
have completed his breakthrough, pushing on inland
after a fierce battle. But the <snemy was very well post
ed in the hills behind the bridgehead, and Supreme
Headquarters probably turned thumbs down on any
serious attempt in this area, for the time being. There
were less bloody ways of whining.
Hodges managed to rest his center on a ridge be
fore the German reserves got up, making it very strong
defensively. Now, free from worry about a counterat
tack aimed at that part of his line, he expanded his
flanks north and south, lengthening his line. Von Kcs
selring, who took command shortly after he established
his bridgehead, could only plug new units into his lines
around it for fear that either his flank would be turned
or his lines would be stretched too thin.
SAAK
Now practically all of the German reserves were
either tied down at Ramagen or in second line on the
Westphalian plain, awaiting the attack of Field-Marshal
Sir Bernard Montgomery's three armies. General Ei
senhower decided to open an offensive in a new quarter,
cracking the difficult southern end of the front.
This was perhaps the strongest sector of the Sieg
fried Line. Its right covered by the Moselle and its
left in the Vosges, its center, around Saarbrucken, had
held off all frontal attacks launched by both Generals
Patch and Patton.
Now that Patton was operating to its north, however,
and had broken through to Coblentz, the German units
covering the right wing of the seemingly attack-proof
compartment, had to hold about a hundred miles of
river front as compared with only 20 or 30 previously.

located in the Saar, the Ruhr and Silesia have fallen,
along with much of the industry necessary to keep an
army going. The Germans might have had a chance
in a hundred if this war was the 18th Century, but none
now.
We are witnessing the end play of the European war.
What has happened and what will are the elements of
the most dramatic history in 1945.
; KAMAGEN
The first breech in the enemy defenses came at Ra
magen. Our destruction of the German center was so
complete during the battle of the Siegrried line that,
by the time we reached the Rhine, the east bank was
only spottily guarded. We got across the river at Rama
gen, but Von Rundstedt, then commander of the Ger
man forces, got reserves up and plugged the gap.
General Hodges, commanding in this sector, could
have completed his breakthrough, pushing on inland
after a fierce battle. But the <snemy was very well post
ed in the hills behind the bridgehead, and Supreme
Headquarters probably turned thumbs down on any
serious attempt in this area, for the time being. There
were less bloody ways of whining.
Hodges managed to rest his center on a ridge be
fore the German reserves got up, making it very strong
defensively. Now, free from worry about a counterat
tack aimed at that part of his line, he expanded his
flanks north and south, lengthening his line. Von Kcs
selring, who took command shortly after he established
his bridgehead, could only plug new units into his lines
around it for fear that either his flank would be turned
or his lines would be stretched too thin.
SAAK
Now practically all of the German reserves were
either tied down at Ramagen or in second line on the
Westphalian plain, awaiting the attack of Field-Marshal
Sir Bernard Montgomery's three armies. General Ei
senhower decided to open an offensive in a new quarter,
cracking the difficult southern end of the front.
This was perhaps the strongest sector of the Sieg
fried Line. Its right covered by the Moselle and its
left in the Vosges, its center, around Saarbrucken, had
held off all frontal attacks launched by both Generals
Patch and Patton.
Now that Patton was operating to its north, however,
and had broken through to Coblentz, the German units
covering the right wing of the seemingly attack-proof
compartment, had to hold about a hundred miles of
river front as compared with only 20 or 30 previously.
They were much too weak for their new task, and
things were in such a dangerous condition everyplace
else that they could not be reinforced.
RAMAGEN BRIDGEHEAD
General Patton, who had now consolidated his
breakthrough, suddenly crossed the Moselle with two
armored divisions and 18 attached tank batallions, ut
terly smashing the thin German line. At the same time,
General Hodges extended his Ramagen bridgehead to
cut the Autobahn linking Frankfort and Cologne, thus
effectively separating the two German wings.
The Germans in the south made ap immediate re
treat. They should have pulled out long before, but
Corporal Hitler had made a stand or die order Their
retrograde movement was too late, as General Patton
took Kaiserlautern, controlling their lines of march, and
effectively annihalated them.
Now there was nothing on the German southern
wing. Patton pushed to Mainz and crossed the Rhine
against light opposition, moving northwards. Marshal
Montgomery, attacking with landing boats and behind
a withering artillery barrage, crossed north of the Ruhr.
WESTPHALIAN PLAINS
The troops the enemy had on the Westphalian plain
were more numerous than in any other sector, but they
were too weak to deal with both Montgomery and Pat
ton in detail. Thus retreat was the only course open
to the enemy, because if he tried to stand along the
Rhine, General Patton might work around his rear
and a debacle would occur on a scale making the Saar
battle look like a patrol action.
The retreat was as orderly as possible, but not or
derly enough. M;iYiy rearguards were sacrificed, includ
ing one of 50,000 men in the Ruhr, although this, too,
might have been the victim of a Hitlerian "stand or die"
order.
Now the enemy is in full retreat towards the Weser.
