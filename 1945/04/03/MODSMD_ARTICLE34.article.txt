# Vacation Tans Back to School

### CATHERINE OWEN 
Vacation tans were the only bright
things apparent yesterday morning
in the deep interior of the Ad Build
ing. Most were quite obviously one
of three types.
Type No. 1: A bright pinkish glow
coating a blissful "I'm dead, but I
dunnit" expression. Further char
acteristics might be a carefully un
shaved face, or the more feminine
snow-soaked, dried, resoaked hair.
Undeniably, though, our Yosemite
tan was contented, as it glowed down
at the elk and moose frolicking on

the wooly chest of its owner.
Type No. 2: This tan had more of
a burned marshmallow effect, and
belonged to those people who spent
their vacations at home. In general, '
they were being repulsively eager
by standing squarely on their feet
and spouting energy accumulated
through too many relatives, too many
breakfasts in bed, too much beach — I
or sun lamp.
Type No. 3: They stayed at Stan
ford just to see what lay on the cam
pus beyond the civ libe. These tans j
were tan, but were neither glowing
nor marshmallow-like—they merely
impressed one as being parched pig- '
ment with nothing more to say for
themselves than "blah." Their wear
ers looked a bit weary from evenings
spent crowded around radios, listen
ing to reports of rain in Los Angeles:
a bit strained from constructing wind i
shelters at the boat house; and a bit
dissipated from the world beyond the
civ libe.
Then there were those duller char
acters who didn't spend their vaca- 1
tions in California.
