PARIS, Tuesday, April 3 (UP). â€” 1
British and Canadian troops whipped !
across the northern end of the west- I
ern front last night in a great drive J
to encircle an estimated 50,000 Ger- I
mans in Holland, as other Allied
forces repulsed enemy attempts to
break out of the Ruhr where more j
than 100,000 Nazi troops are trapped. ,
At the same time the advance to- '
ward Berlin was unchecked with the j
U.S. Third Army reaching within !
152 miles of the Reich capital.
Two Canadian divisions aided by j
British tanks smashed the German
paratroop line on the British north- I
ern flank and drove 15 miles into 1
Holland as Field Marshal Sir Ber
nard L. Montgomery lifted a secu- I
rity blackout to disclose that his
forces were fighting for Muenster
with advance units rolling some 50 j
miles beyond through the great
Tuetoberger Forest.
The huge enemy force trapped in j
the Ruhr made its first major at- i
tempt to escape and attacked the j
U.S. First Army ninth infantry di- j
vision near Siegen. Allied Supreme !

Headquarters said that elimination
of the encircled Germans would not
stop the Allied drive on Berlin.
