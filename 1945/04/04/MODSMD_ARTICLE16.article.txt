# PENCIL TAPPING
## 
### 
Spring cleaning time on the Stanford campus
and time too to clean up an old campus problem
that has burned up a lot of editorial and cam
pus opinion space, to say nothing of hours spent
in debates, bull sessions, and arguments. We're
speaking of the Honor Code and all that has
been discussed recently about "group responsi
bility," "individual responsibility," "third per
son"—problems that have developed in the en
forcement of a code that is one of the greatest
"Stanford traditions"; that is, for many, a way
of life.
Enforcement, it seems, is the problem; the so
lution, another "Stanford tradition" brought to
the fore by a letter to the editor in the last Daily
of winter quarter—the system of tapping with a
pen or pencil on the desk or table in the class
room when someone is suspected of cheating,
until the guilty student ceases his suspicious
activities. Here is a proved and endorsed meth
od of Honor Code enforcement, one that avoids
the unpleasant connotations of "third person re
sponsibility." Something of as deep and per
sonal a nature as honor cannot be strictly legis
lated or regimented.
The maintenance of a code of honor needs
spontaneous action of individual and group. In
the words of the writer of the campus opinion:
"Tapping is one way of using the standard, act
ing through the greater power given by the
group, to bring the isolated and offending mem
ber of that group to a consciousness of the
power of that standard."—H. D.
