# BRETTON WOODS
## 
### 
If occasionally there should be something
genuine to take the shroud of cynicism from our
bent academic shoulders, the honestly arrived
at, desperately needed plans of the Bretton
A/oods conference would be it. If occasionally
we should find solace and gentle affirmation in

the words of the wise, a letter sent to the Chron
icle from Stanford professors approving Bret
ton Woods, is it.
We are not lacking, either, in an element of
drama for this serene picture. Right now in the
Senate there is a bloc forming that is prepared
to knock this entire plan out of commission.
The danger of the United States insisting upon
the last limits of its influence in so far as wealth
makes it, is to do more than ask revision of eco
nomic plans for the future, in the words of the
economists: "In view of . . . the extensive con
cessions made to the United States at Bretton
Woods and the ill will we v/ould incur by in
sisting on reservations it is doubtful whether
another agreement could be reached at all or,
if reached, whether it would be a better one."
It is to be borne in mind that more than forty
governments were represented at the monetary
conference. The negotiations lasted for weeks.
The problems were complex and difficult. Many
heartening concessions were made on both
sides. The Russians, for instance, after gaining
a concession in their share of the fund, refused
it, and agreed to contribute the sum originally
asked for.
The conference itself reflects an acutely in
telligent handling of the necessary foundation
for world peace—economics. It is mere decep
tion to talk of peace and dignity for all nations
if many are left without financial aid to gain the
means for feeding and clothing their people and
engaging them in productive livelihoods. Na
tions left free, only to impoverishment, will
value their freedom and other people's very
lightly.
If a small Senate bloc obscures the vision
of the nation in accepting the Bretton Woods
proposals we will have failed to profit by a
costly lesson of this last generation—that both
war and depression are contagious throughout
the world and strangely linked to the history
of oppression and hate. If they are not corrected
at the root no amount of mere "faith" in de
mocracy can bring us peace and prosperity.
