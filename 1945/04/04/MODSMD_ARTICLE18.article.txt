### PEGGY FITTS 
Where were you at 7:21 on the morning of April
4. 15)457 Cramming for your early hour class in Bas
ket Weaving? . . . Having your cast autographed?
. . . Wherever you were you missed a sunrise cere
mony in (he Bender Room where the traditional
Thunder Rider helmet and cleats, together with the
keys to the Scientific City of Murvania were turned
over to the new Bull Scssioner, Peggy Fitts.
And here we have:
OH RAPTURE, RAPTURE!
Back again. Back to the time and the place, namely,
spring quarter on the Fahm. Back to the bad old days
of Cellar 10 o'clocks, Folk Dancing by moonlight (Pa- j
cific War Time), Dr. Popper, the Waffle Shop, and 15
units of Boathouse. (Don't overdo, dear." "Okay,
Mom."
Back to the cigaret line that has cigarets at the end
of it, and the Tostados (just like Pilar used to make),
and the VitaSerts on the Cellar counter. (Pete says,
"VitaSerts have made me the man I am today.")
Back to the Tuesday Evening Series and the Or
chesis recital and Gene Autry and the two Concerts
(count 'em, two), and the Stanford Players and the
Con Home Drive and the Sophomore Carnival and the
Spring Show, as advertised.
Back to Victorian Poetry and Motion Pictures (units
for Van Johnson!) and Western Civ and Woman in the
Home. Back for some to the palatial offices of the
Peninsula's Only Morning Newspaper (let me out of
here!) with the clean pictures and the dirty spoons
and the bottles on the roof contributed by the boys
from the penthouse publication—the newer cheaper
Chappie, suh!
Back to the bright dresses and the brown legs and
the dark glasses and the smell of Skol, picnics in the
hills, picnics at the Lake, picnics down the highway
(all kinds of picnics!) Back to the bandage-rolling and
Nurse's aiding and blood donating and hoping for
the best. And getting it some of these days.
Glad to see ya!
(NOTE to all Junior Thunder Riders—Smith, from
her hand-made tunnel under the coke machine, an
nounced that the headquarters of the organ-i-zation
has been transferred to the basement of the powah
house, and keep your slimy hands off the switch
board. Now, fellas, will you please get your horses
ovt of here?)
