We can't yell at the edit-board. al
though once in a while we leave our
sanctuary and brave their anger, for
they have been fair to us. They have
given us room for ourselves (when it
is clean it is the best room in the
Daily Shack); they have compli
mented us for our efforts in trying to
bring hack sports at Stanford; they
have even, at times, agreed with us.
But now they have hurt us deeply;
they have said, in the first editorial
of the quarter, that there are no
sports at Stanford.
These are the things that make us
feel like really going on the war
path. These are the things that dis
courage future full-time participants
and at the same time deride the ef
forts of those who didn't believe in
throwing out sports. The Palo Alto
Independents proved that Stanford
could put out a team, a team good
enough to beat some of the best in
the Bay Area. And now, with base
ball, track, wrestling, and other
sports coming into season, Stanford
is again going to prove its worth.
Harry Wolters, one of the top base
ball coaches on the coast, has a group
of boys under him who may not be
great stars, but who are interested
enough to go out and fight. We don't
know if they will play any collegiate
games; the significant part is that
they are organizing a team and are
continuing with sports.
And in track, we find the same
thing. Pitch Johnson has under him
three very fine athletes — Johnny
Fulton, Ed Luce, and Gordon Levy
We don't have to go into the history
of Fulton; all he did \yas break the
(»(i0 world's record and defeat some
of the top runners of the day in the
XBO and mile. And the accomplish
ments of Ed Luce speak for them
selves. At this moment he is rated
as one of the best high jumpers in
the nation. Last year, at the nation
als, he placed very high. This year
he could probably win the event.
Finally we come to Levy. He has
never had a chance to run in college,
as he graduated only last year from
high school, but his high school
times in the dashes would have been
fast enough to have him place in
most collegiate meets of 1944. Prob
ably Gordon's biggest accomplish
ment is his winning of the Northern
California 100-yard dash at the Fres
no Relays in 10.1 seconds. With
those three men alone, not counting
the other above average tracksters
on campus, Stanford could put out
a formidable team.
Wrestling is the same. Last quar
ter the team entered some meets and
did very well. This year they are
better than ever. With men like
this we just can't understand why
the edit-board said that there are
no sports at Stanford. Stanford has
abolished intercollegiate sports for
the "duration and six," but the men
of Stanford are still doing their best
and trying as hard as ever. With a
little support, we can revive the
spirit.
The Palo Alto Independents gave
us the start last quarter; it is our
job. all of us, to see that their ef
forts were not in vain and that the
"boom" years come again.

Wrestling is the same. Last quar
ter the team entered some meets and
did very well. This year they are
better than ever. With men like
this we just can't understand why
the edit-board said that there are
no sports at Stanford. Stanford has
abolished intercollegiate sports for
the "duration and six," but the men
of Stanford are still doing their best
and trying as hard as ever. With a
little support, we can revive the
spirit.
The Palo Alto Independents gave
us the start last quarter; it is our
job. all of us, to see that their ef
forts were not in vain and that the
"boom" years come again.
We can't yell at the edit-board. al
though once in a while we leave our
sanctuary and brave their anger, for
they have been fair to us. They have
given us room for ourselves (when it
is clean it is the best room in the
Daily Shack); they have compli
mented us for our efforts in trying to
bring hack sports at Stanford; they
have even, at times, agreed with us.
But now they have hurt us deeply;
they have said, in the first editorial
of the quarter, that there are no
sports at Stanford.
These are the things that make us
feel like really going on the war
path. These are the things that dis
courage future full-time participants
and at the same time deride the ef
forts of those who didn't believe in
throwing out sports. The Palo Alto
Independents proved that Stanford
could put out a team, a team good
enough to beat some of the best in
the Bay Area. And now, with base
ball, track, wrestling, and other
sports coming into season, Stanford
is again going to prove its worth.
Harry Wolters, one of the top base
ball coaches on the coast, has a group
of boys under him who may not be
great stars, but who are interested
enough to go out and fight. We don't
know if they will play any collegiate
games; the significant part is that
they are organizing a team and are
continuing with sports.
And in track, we find the same
thing. Pitch Johnson has under him
three very fine athletes — Johnny
Fulton, Ed Luce, and Gordon Levy
We don't have to go into the history
of Fulton; all he did \yas break the
(»(i0 world's record and defeat some
of the top runners of the day in the
XBO and mile. And the accomplish
ments of Ed Luce speak for them
selves. At this moment he is rated
as one of the best high jumpers in
the nation. Last year, at the nation
als, he placed very high. This year
he could probably win the event.
Finally we come to Levy. He has
never had a chance to run in college,
as he graduated only last year from
high school, but his high school
times in the dashes would have been
fast enough to have him place in
most collegiate meets of 1944. Prob
ably Gordon's biggest accomplish
ment is his winning of the Northern
California 100-yard dash at the Fres
no Relays in 10.1 seconds. With
those three men alone, not counting
the other above average tracksters
on campus, Stanford could put out
a formidable team.
