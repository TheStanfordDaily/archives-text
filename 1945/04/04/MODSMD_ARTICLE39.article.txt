# Rosburg Gains Semi-Finals
## 
### 
Wartime athletics have been limit
ed to almost all intramural activi
ties at Stanford, hut Bob Rosburg,
Stanford sophomore, has gone out
on his own to do some sensational
golf playing this year. Ilis putting
eye has won him wider acclaim from
Bay Area sports writers, helped him
cop the Northern California junior
title last year, and then go on to
lose a close match to Ernie Pieper
of San Jose at Pebble Beach last
September, in the finals.
Rosburg has consistently been in
the running in tournaments this
year. He almost repeated his claim
to junior title, but was upset in the
semi-finals by Bob Harris, another
San Jose boy, after defeating Jim
French in the quarter-finals.
Boh had another near miss when
he battled his way to the finals in
the San Francisco City Tournament
only to drop his final match to Bill
Frit/, Harding Park champion, last
Saturday. Conspicuous not only by
his youth, hut by his amazing put
ting ability, Rosburg is following
closely in the footsteps of other Stan
ford golfing greats such as Lawson
Little and Ray "Bud" Brownell, who
was recently killed in action while
in the Armed Forces.
Although intercollegiate competi
tion seems to be out for the duration
at Stanford, we can, perhaps, usurp
a little of Bob Rosburg's glory by
claiming him as our own
