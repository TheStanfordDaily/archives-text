# 'Farm's '40 Team Tops,' Shaughnessy
## 
### 
Returning to the coast for his
daughter's wedding, Clark Shaugh
nessy, ex-Stanford coach, was cor
nered by the press and finally gave
his opinions on football last year
While speaking of football in the
East, Mr. Shaughnessy stated how he
believed the Stanford team of 1940,
the team that brought him his great
recognition as a coach, was equal to
the Army team which went through
an undefeated season.
He also stated that the Army teaiii
reminded him very much of hi>
Stanford team; that Blanchard hit
the line with the same power that
Standless displayed for four years,
and that the Army line was also
tops. However, he felt that Albert
was a better T quarterback than an\
the Army, or any other team, could
find.
Mr. Shaughnessy is still at Pitt
and was very satisfied with his
team's showing. He expects to con
tinue coaching at Pitt.
