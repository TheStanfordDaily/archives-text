# Farm To Vote On Excom's Membership
## 
### 
The following subjects were dis
cussed at Excom's first spring quar
ter meeting last night:
Election Board report, election
referendum
Report on graduate member
Proposed Article X, A.S.S.U. Con
stitution
Curfew
A referendum on the member
ship of Executive Committee and the
system of representation, as publi-

ci/.ed in the Daily
last quarter and
as discussed in
previous Excom
meetings, will be
held on Tuesday,
under the super
vision of the re
cently appointed

Election Board and its chairman, J.
D. Williams.
Tlie referendum will inquire whe
ther or not the individual favors the
following general method of repre
sentation:
"Proposed: that elective members
of Executive Committee with the
exception of the president, vice
president and graduate member, be
elected directly by, and shall repre
sent, areas of living groups. Voters
to vote only for the representative or
representatives of their area.
"This proposal would abolish the
present system of election at large
and representation by classes. The
change would not aflcct other stu
dent body officers."
The proposal was passed creating
the office of Excom member repre
senting all graduate and undergrad
uate members living off-campus, to
be elected by them, and perpetuating
the office of graduate member,
elected at large to serve in an ad
visory capacity. The recommenda
tion was made in a report by Betsy
Rabbitt and Bernadette Giannini.
Whether or not women's social
regulations should be included under
the jurisdiction of Honor Code was
discussed by Excom and visitors
when Bill Gilbert, chairman of the
constitutional committee, submitted
the proposed draft of Article X. The
principal argument against, as pre
sented by Gilbert, is that the Honor
Code should not be spread beyond
the classic boundaries of application
to academic work in the belief that
this would weaken the Code. On
the other hand, he said, this spread-

ing seems to be an accomplished fact
through custom and general accept
ance by ihe women.
This proposed article incorporates
the Code and the Fundamental j
Standard into the main body of the j
j constitution rather than leaving them
I as by-laws.
An election rally will be held on
Monday, April 16, for all students
at which A.S.S.U. officers will speak,
defining their offices and duties. De
signed principally to arouse stu
dent interest in the elections, this
rally will be under the jurisdiction
of the newly appointed election
board, consisting of Ruth Lewis,
Janet Ossman, Frank Schiff, and
Jerry Matin.
The 12 o'clock curfew definitely
applies to all school dances, accord
ing to the report of Jim Emerson, but
word from Dr. Alvin Eurich has not
yet been received as to whether or
not dances sponsored by living
groups come under this ruling.
Dr. Tresidder will speak on '"The
Story of Stanford" to all students
who wish to attend an assembly on
April 12 under Cardinals sponsor

Whether or not women's social
regulations should be included under
the jurisdiction of Honor Code was
discussed by Excom and visitors
when Bill Gilbert, chairman of the
constitutional committee, submitted
the proposed draft of Article X. The
principal argument against, as pre
sented by Gilbert, is that the Honor
Code should not be spread beyond
the classic boundaries of application
to academic work in the belief that
this would weaken the Code. On
the other hand, he said, this spread-

ing seems to be an accomplished fact
through custom and general accept
ance by ihe women.
This proposed article incorporates
the Code and the Fundamental j
Standard into the main body of the j

I as by-laws.
An election rally will be held on
Monday, April 16, for all students

signed principally to arouse stu
dent interest in the elections, this

of the newly appointed election
board, consisting of Ruth Lewis,
Janet Ossman, Frank Schiff, and
Jerry Matin.
The 12 o'clock curfew definitely
applies to all school dances, accord
ing to the report of Jim Emerson, but
word from Dr. Alvin Eurich has not
yet been received as to whether or
not dances sponsored by living
groups come under this ruling.

The following subjects were dis
cussed at Excom's first spring quar
ter meeting last night:
Election Board report, election
referendum
Report on graduate member
Proposed Article X, A.S.S.U. Con
stitution
Curfew
A referendum on the member
ship of Executive Committee and the
system of representation, as publi-

ci/.ed in the Daily
last quarter and
as discussed in
previous Excom
meetings, will be
held on Tuesday,
under the super
vision of the re
cently appointed

Election Board and its chairman, J.
D. Williams.
Tlie referendum will inquire whe
ther or not the individual favors the
following general method of repre
sentation:
"Proposed: that elective members
of Executive Committee with the
exception of the president, vice
president and graduate member, be
elected directly by, and shall repre
sent, areas of living groups. Voters
to vote only for the representative or
representatives of their area.
"This proposal would abolish the
present system of election at large
and representation by classes. The
change would not aflcct other stu
dent body officers."
The proposal was passed creating
the office of Excom member repre
senting all graduate and undergrad
uate members living off-campus, to
be elected by them, and perpetuating
the office of graduate member,
elected at large to serve in an ad
visory capacity. The recommenda
