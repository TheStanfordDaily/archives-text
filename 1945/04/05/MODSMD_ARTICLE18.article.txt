# Ryukyuans Have 'Double Allegiance'---Schwartz
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
"The people of the Ryukyu Islands have a double allegiance—(<» China
ami Japan," stated Professor YV. L. Schwartz, yesterday in an interview
with the Daily.
Professor Schwartz taught in Japan for several years, while his father
was a missionary living on Okinawa from 1906 to 1015; he visited Okinawa
three times while he was there and became interested in the islands at that
time.
Today, as American troops, battle over ground that had not seen
lighting since the Japanese invasion of 1609. Okinawans show contra
dictory feelings as to where their loyalty lies. Before 1609, as an inde
pendent people, they had considerable intercourse with the Chinese,
adopting many of their manners, customs, and forms of sanitation.
"To a Japanese, the Okinawans seem very Chinese," Professor Schwartz
said. "They build large vaulted tombs in the Fuchow style; their roof
tiles, carpenters' tools, and carrying poles are very like those of the Chi
nese. The country people live in square huts with the ground for a floor,
but the town dwellings are like Chinese houses," he added. Their offices
arc in Western architecture.
There is no physical difference between the Japanese and the Okina
wans, Professor Schwartz affirmed; although newspaper reports have de
scribed them as a scrubby people, he declared that when dressed alike,
Japanese and Okinawans cannot distinguish one from the other. The only
difference between them is that Okinawans can grow a beard, a relatively
difficult feat for the average Japanese male.
In the Ryukyu Islands all the trade and business is carried on by the
women. They can also carry tremendous burdens on their heads, loads
which would and do require two or three men to lift. They arc short, but
stand very erect and don't have the slouch characteristic of Japanese
women. They wear the native pattern of clothes, kimonos that have wider

stripes and gayer colors than those of the Japanese. Okinawan mothers
and daughters always dress cxactly alike.
The men on the other hand are dignified and idle. They do little work
except for fishing and farming, and arc not too ambitious. The women
are expert weavers and weave a "great deal of silk, cotton, and grass j
clothes."
The Japanese have a concealed contempt for these members of their
oldest colony, over which they extended political control in 1H79. The
Okinawans probably entered (he archipelago from the north, said
Professor Schwartz, as their language has many similarities to Japa
nese.
The Ryukyu Islands, of which Okinawa is the largest, form a chain
connecting J ipan with Formosa. They are tropical in climate, and. said
Professor Schwartz, "as the tropics are the rich man's paradise and the
poor man's hell, so is it hell for poor Okinawa." Over 600,000 people live
in the archipelago, which is devastated yearly by typhoons. "Incidentally,"
said Professor Schwartz, "our commanders picked an excellent time for
the invasion as the weather is now warm and dry in that region."
The native name for the archipelago is Duchu, the meaning of which is |
not known since it originated before the time of writing; the main island,
Okinawa, is called Uchina in the native tongue.
The islands are a combination of both tropical and temperate climates, j
To people from the north it seems tropical because it has banyan trees, j
sugar cane (the large cash crop of the islands), palms, bananas, and warm
weather even in January due to the Japanese current.
To people from the south, however, it seems temperate because of the j
prevailing breezes, pine trees, the absence of jungles, and the shortage of
water. When asked what Okinawans do for water when there is none,
Pprofessor Schwartz replied, "They drink whiskey."
There is no electric power except for a little to light houses; however,

there is not enough for Okinawans to operate even one streetcar. The
terrain itself is much like that of Hawaii, though the sunshine there is
"liquid sunshine," according to Professor Schwartz, who added, "there is
very much rain in the islands."
Since the Japanese assumed political control of the islands they
have built good roads, extended primary education to all hut the poor
peasants, and introduced medicine and some electric li&ht plants.
Though Duchuan sugar used to be very valuable to the Japanese, it has
now been replaced by Formosan sugar, and attempts have been made lately
to develop Ryukyu's winter vegetable crops; and agricultural experiment
stations have been established to promote this project.
The Duchuan people are mild and kindly. They have never had an
army, and a Ifith century edict, by the king allows no one to possess swords
or arms. Followers of the Confucian philosophy, they owe nominal alle
giance to their King of Kings, who is a marquis living in Tokyo. They
have no particular affection for the Mikado, and Professor Schwartz said
that the recent mass suicide found on Tokashiki Island was performed in
honor of their relatives at home and not for the emperor.
"Many civilians of Okinawa will survive the present attacks," he
said, "bccause they can see that our assault forces are more powerful
than the Mikado's gods." The great problem for us is to care for them
after we have conquered the islands, he said, "because they will soon
lack everything from salt to matches."
The Ryukyus harbor the mosquito which carries dengue fever, and sev
eral kinds of the pit viper, a snake which used to be common there. "But
I don't think they can bite through G.I. boots," said Professor Schwartz.
Professor Schwartz came to Stanford as a student in 1920, after having
taught English in two Japanese government colleges for several years. He
speaks Japanese fluently and in 1943-44 was lecturer in Japanese for the
ASTP. He began teaching at Stanford in 1921 and is now an associate
professor of Romanic languages.
