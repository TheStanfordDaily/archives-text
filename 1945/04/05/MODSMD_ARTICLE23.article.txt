# "THE FORGOTTEN MAN"

### 
THE SPECIAL DELIVERY MAN
The cynicism of people about government
is too bad; and the cynicism about doing any
thing about it is too bad, too. But a letter came
in our mail that we think calls for some kind of
kick in the pants at "the government of the
people," even by plain, mostly non-voting citi
zens' paltry brogans.
The letter we refer to is from Stanford's spe
cial delivery mail man, Mr. Robert Collyer, who
from his constant attention to his business about
campus, and his lively interest in our campus
and its people, deserves our most respectful
attention.
Mr. Collyer has called to our notice the fact
that the men in his work, the special delivery
mail men of the United States, work in a pe
culiar capacity for men in the federal service.
They receive no salary, they are paid by the
piece; nor do they receive protection against
accident or illness. He has no minimum hours
per day, and he works 8 to 12 hours regularly,
365 days a year.
He receives no vacation with or without pay,
and no pension when he is no longer able to
work at his job which is constantly exposed to
accident and weather. From his own income he
supplies the gas, oil, and expenses of his work.
The matter which brings this deplorable situ
ation to the fore is that there is now before Con
gress a bill (HR 2071) which is supposed to re
classify postal employees, to bring eguitable
conditions to their jobs. By some yet - unex
plained trick of governmental workings, the
special delivery mail men are not included in
this bill.
The unfairness of this situation has long ex
isted, and it seems this is the ideal time to seek
their correction. Only the inexcusable inertia
of government can cause our Congressmen to
fail to act upon this omission now. It is essen
tial, however, that the facts be brought to their
attention.
In three letters to the Postmaster General, Mr.
Collyer states he has received only three form
letters in reply, stating that the Postmaster Gen
eral "has no authority in the matter." Of his
responsibility for his employees, he makes no
mention.
The San Francisco Examiner has endorsed the
bill, and undoubtedly other papers throughout
the nation have done the same. But it is prob
able that they are unaware of this omission for
its effectiveness.
The urgency of this matter rests in the fact
that this is the time that the postal employees
arc being considered, and the special delivery
men, if overlooked now, will have little chance
of special legislation for a long time.
Taking a pea-shooter to the edifice of gov
ernmental inertia might be effective if enough
of would send this or a paraphrase of this
information, now, to our Congressmen, or to
Konneth McKellar's Post Office Committee, in
Washington, D.C. It deserves attention.

per day, and he works 8 to 12 hours regularly,
365 days a year.
He receives no vacation with or without pay,
and no pension when he is no longer able to
work at his job which is constantly exposed to
accident and weather. From his own income he
supplies the gas, oil, and expenses of his work.
The matter which brings this deplorable situ
ation to the fore is that there is now before Con
gress a bill (HR 2071) which is supposed to re
classify postal employees, to bring eguitable
conditions to their jobs. By some yet - unex
plained trick of governmental workings, the
special delivery mail men are not included in
this bill.
The unfairness of this situation has long ex
isted, and it seems this is the ideal time to seek
their correction. Only the inexcusable inertia
of government can cause our Congressmen to
fail to act upon this omission now. It is essen
tial, however, that the facts be brought to their
attention.
In three letters to the Postmaster General, Mr.
Collyer states he has received only three form
letters in reply, stating that the Postmaster Gen
eral "has no authority in the matter." Of his
responsibility for his employees, he makes no
mention.
The San Francisco Examiner has endorsed the
bill, and undoubtedly other papers throughout
the nation have done the same. But it is prob
able that they are unaware of this omission for
its effectiveness.
The urgency of this matter rests in the fact
that this is the time that the postal employees
arc being considered, and the special delivery
men, if overlooked now, will have little chance
of special legislation for a long time.
Taking a pea-shooter to the edifice of gov
ernmental inertia might be effective if enough
of would send this or a paraphrase of this
information, now, to our Congressmen, or to
Konneth McKellar's Post Office Committee, in
Washington, D.C. It deserves attention.
THE SPECIAL DELIVERY MAN
The cynicism of people about government
is too bad; and the cynicism about doing any
thing about it is too bad, too. But a letter came
in our mail that we think calls for some kind of
kick in the pants at "the government of the
people," even by plain, mostly non-voting citi
zens' paltry brogans.
The letter we refer to is from Stanford's spe
cial delivery mail man, Mr. Robert Collyer, who
from his constant attention to his business about
campus, and his lively interest in our campus
and its people, deserves our most respectful
attention.
Mr. Collyer has called to our notice the fact
that the men in his work, the special delivery
mail men of the United States, work in a pe
culiar capacity for men in the federal service.
They receive no salary, they are paid by the
piece; nor do they receive protection against
accident or illness. He has no minimum hours
per day, and he works 8 to 12 hours regularly,
365 days a year.
He receives no vacation with or without pay,
and no pension when he is no longer able to
work at his job which is constantly exposed to
accident and weather. From his own income he
supplies the gas, oil, and expenses of his work.
