As was predicted in this column, American forces
have landed in the Riukius. A combined army of Ma
rine and Infantry divisions under command of the
brilliant son of the Confederate officer to whom Gen
eral Grant dictated the "unconditional surrender" terms
during the Fort Henry-Fort Donelson campaign-
Lieut. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, has landed on Okin
awa, the strategic center of the chain.
So far, the island has been divided by a thrust across
it near its geometrical base, and Buckner's forces have
not yet met heavy enemy resistance.
The Japanese garrison probably was not strong
enough to hold the island's whole coast-line, and,
instead of trying to launch a counter-offensive against
such a powerful force, as Buckner got ashore, it seems
to have decided to dig in inland. It has yet to be dealt
with.
COMING BATTLE
Okinawa possesses many sharply rising ridges which
play such a prominent part in Japanese defensive tac
tics. Unlike such places as Iwo, however, Okinawa is
large and seemingly lightly held.
Since the success of maneuver is always a ratio be
tween the forces involved in a particular battle and
the space they are operating in, General Buckner
should manage to force the Japanese into a pocket
by using a little art, and might be able to capture the
whole island with a minimum of bloody frontal at
tacks.
JAP STRATEGY FAULTY
His astounding success so far seems to indicate a cer
tain definite fallacy in enemy strategy.
Our previous landing operations in the Pacific have
cut off a quarter of a million Japanese troops. This be
came inevitable after Midway.
The enemy rightly drew his fleet back from such
outposts as the Marshall and Gilbert islands, because
he did not have the prerequisite air force to defend the
long sea line he started the war with. But the second
question is, why didn't he also remove his garrisons
there?
Moreover, he could have kept fairly good communi
cations with the parts of his front, since his shipping
lines could be short and down the East China Sea.
American fleet units trying to interrupt them would
have to shoot their way through the entire enemy air
force, his navy, submarines, and fast motor torpedo
boats, which can be made in great numbers, based on
the China coast, and on the various islands of his sea
defense line.
If he did, such islands as the Riukius would have
been very hard to attack. We would be forced to try
them to get anywhere in thre Pacific, and a quarter of
a million Japanese, now starving in the Central Pa
cific, would have been there to meet us. But the enemy
played his cards differently and thus violated the impli
cations of a basic phrase of strategy: "economy of
force."

not yet met heavy enemy resistance.
The Japanese garrison probably was not strong
enough to hold the island's whole coast-line, and,
instead of trying to launch a counter-offensive against
such a powerful force, as Buckner got ashore, it seems
to have decided to dig in inland. It has yet to be dealt
with.
COMING BATTLE
Okinawa possesses many sharply rising ridges which
play such a prominent part in Japanese defensive tac
tics. Unlike such places as Iwo, however, Okinawa is
large and seemingly lightly held.
Since the success of maneuver is always a ratio be
tween the forces involved in a particular battle and
the space they are operating in, General Buckner
should manage to force the Japanese into a pocket
by using a little art, and might be able to capture the
whole island with a minimum of bloody frontal at
tacks.
JAP STRATEGY FAULTY
His astounding success so far seems to indicate a cer
tain definite fallacy in enemy strategy.
Our previous landing operations in the Pacific have
cut off a quarter of a million Japanese troops. This be
came inevitable after Midway.
The enemy rightly drew his fleet back from such
outposts as the Marshall and Gilbert islands, because
he did not have the prerequisite air force to defend the
long sea line he started the war with. But the second
question is, why didn't he also remove his garrisons
there?
Moreover, he could have kept fairly good communi
cations with the parts of his front, since his shipping
lines could be short and down the East China Sea.
American fleet units trying to interrupt them would
have to shoot their way through the entire enemy air
force, his navy, submarines, and fast motor torpedo
boats, which can be made in great numbers, based on
the China coast, and on the various islands of his sea
defense line.
If he did, such islands as the Riukius would have
been very hard to attack. We would be forced to try
them to get anywhere in thre Pacific, and a quarter of
a million Japanese, now starving in the Central Pa
cific, would have been there to meet us. But the enemy
played his cards differently and thus violated the impli
cations of a basic phrase of strategy: "economy of
force."
As was predicted in this column, American forces
have landed in the Riukius. A combined army of Ma
rine and Infantry divisions under command of the
brilliant son of the Confederate officer to whom Gen
eral Grant dictated the "unconditional surrender" terms
during the Fort Henry-Fort Donelson campaign-
Lieut. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, has landed on Okin
awa, the strategic center of the chain.
So far, the island has been divided by a thrust across
it near its geometrical base, and Buckner's forces have
not yet met heavy enemy resistance.
