"How do you do?", said Alice in a very polite tone to
the Bad Hatter; the March Hare then hurriedly un
wrapped the Doormouse from about the teapot, intro
duced him to Alice, and straightway set about pouring
the tea.
"Oh Dear!" exclaimed Alice, "I only wanted one cup
of tea." "Nonsense," said the March Hare shortly, "the
weaker sex are entitled to special privileges and 1 insist
that you must have five cups of tea." "We are not the
weaker sex," protested Alice indignantly as she drew
herself up to her full height, "I'll have you know that
I'm not only taller than you, but stronger as well."
"Pooh-pooh," said the Mad Hatter as he poured
cream into Alice's tea with one hand and emptied the
sugar howl into it with the other. "That's nonsense;
it doesn't matter how big or strong you are, you are
the weaker sex and that's that. Sit down and drink
your tea before it gets cold."
Alice immediately burst into tears and even distract
ed the Mad Hatter and the March Hare from their fev
erish tea pouring. "Why is it," sobbed Alice, "that ev
j eryone tells me that I am a girl and must be quiet
j and let other people do things for me? I'm not a girl;
! I'm Alice, and I want to be Alice."
"Social convention, my dear," sighed the Mad Hatter
as he removed a few Doormouse hairs from Alice's tea
! bun and munched on it reflectively. "It's social conven
tion; it says it's sorry, but you arc a girl and must be
have like a girl." "But I don't want social convention,"
said Alice, "it never did me any good, and I'm sure I
never helped it any."
"Only an extraordinary girl," said the Mad Hatter
as he licked the sugar spoon reflectively, "could live
without social convention to tell her what to do and
how to do it. And you, except for your height, are
not an extraordinary girl." Thereupon he replaced
the Doormouse about the teapot ami began to drink
Alice's tea. "Because," he added reflectively, "if you
were an extraordinary girl you wouldn't ask such ex
traordinarily stupid questions."
"You are stupid," continued the March Hare, as he
started on Alice's tea from the other end of the line of
teacups, "and I am stupid. The only thing that makes
it possible for either of us to do anything is because
there Is convention. Convention is an ingenious device
for getting around our abominable stupidity."
"How did convention ever start?", said Alice petu
-1 lantly. "Someone must have been intelligent to have
thought of a good reason for making a thing a conven
tion." "Not at all," replied the Mad Hatter irritably,
"people thought of bad reasons for doing stupid things
and made these conventions because it was convenient.
If a convention is intelligent it is because the stupid
people who made it erred in their judgment."
"Ah!" said Alice brightly, "Then you really agree
with me; if conventions are stupid then I needn't fol
low them, and I can do just as I please!"
At this remark both the Mad Hatter and the March
j Hare turned so suddenly upon poor Alice they upset
1 the last cup of tea all over the Doormouse and the
j tablecloth. "By no means!" they exclaimed in chorus.
"For," said the March Hare in a severe tone, "people
who ignore conventions are just as stupid as the rest of
j us, but in a different and more unpleasant manner."
j "And," added the Mad Hatter, "it makes life unpleasant
: for the rest of us if you go about in a contentious mood,
j sneering at the ignorance of society and trying to dem
-1 onstrate the vast extent of your own particular clever
-1 ness. It's not nice."
"Oh dear!" cried Alice, and began to sob again. "I
reallv didn't mean to be so bad or unpleasant. I do
hope you'll forgive inc. And. andâ€”oh! dear! the tea
has spilt all over ni.v clean frock!" "Never mind," said
the Mad Hatter cheerfully, "there's plenty more!"
And he began to fill Alice's teacups again, while the
March Hare started from the other end with the
cream and sugar.
