# Farm Grad Returns From Manila Chaos
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
When Bert Silen returned to the United States he was as hungry for
some of his mother's fried chicken as he was on the day of his release from
Santo Tomas concentration camp in Manila. At least, that is what the
United Press caption read on the adjoining picture of Silen which appeared
in yesterday's Daily.
What (he United Press didn't know when they sent the picture to the

Daily was that Silen is a Stanford
man. A member of Kappa Alpha, he
graduated in 1922, according to his
mother, Mrs. F. Silen of Oakland;
and was associated with the National
Broadcasting Company in Manila for
many years.
Broadcast During .Manila Bombing
At the time Pearl Harbor was at
tacked Silen made a vow that when
the Japs should bomb Manila (an at
tack Manila Americans had been ex
pecting for years), he would broad
cast a description of the bombing
while it was going on to the United
States; he carried out his vow short
ly before Japanese forces entered the
city.
Silen was imprisoned in Santo To
mas, and later separated from his
wife and three daughters when they
were moved to Los Banos concen
tration camp after the latter had
been established.
Came Home the Quick Way
He was released when American
forces retook Manila, and flew back
to the United States, arriving two
weeks ago. He 1 eft recently for
Washington on unrevealcd business,
according to his mother.
His wife and daughters, Betty,
Shirley, and Joan, are expected here
"any day," said the senior Mrs. Si
len, who addfcd that the family ex
pects to live in Palo Alto, where
Betty, 18, and Shirley, 17, will at
tend Stanford.
Daughter Shot by Japs
Betty Silen was shot in the back
by Japanese troops as she was leav
ing Los Banos upon being released.
She is being flown back on a hospi
tal plane and will remain in Let
terman Hospital. until she has fully
recovered from her wound, said Si
len's mother.
The last time the family was in
the United States was in 1938; Mrs.
Silen and their youngest daughter,
Joan, then one and a half years old,
flew back to Manila by clipper. At
that time Joan was the youngest
child ever to have crossed the Pacific
on the China Clipper.


BERT SILEN, '22, enjoys a hit
of fried thicken at his mother's
home in Oakland. He was recently
released from Santo Tomas con
centration camp in Manila. For
