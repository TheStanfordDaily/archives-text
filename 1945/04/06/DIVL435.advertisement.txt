190,000 people!
I lie little island of Saipan today has communications
facilities greater than those of Hartford, Connecticut.
Without this vast array of telephone, teletype and
radio apparatus—much of it made by Western Electric—
Saipan could not play its key part as an army, navy and
air base in the great drive our lighting forces are making
toward Tokyo.
When you realize that Saipan is only one small island
—and that many more bases must be taken and similarly
developed—you get some idea of the job still ahead.
Today the manpower and manufacturing facilities of
Western Electric are devoted to meeting our fighters'
increased needs. That's why there is not enough tele
phone equipment for all civilian requirements.
Buy all the War Bonds you can—and keep them!
