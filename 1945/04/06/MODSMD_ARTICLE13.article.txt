# Ten False Alarms Interrupt Fire Department
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
Between March 7, of last quarter,
and last night, April 4. ten false
alarms were turned in to the Stan
lord Fire Department. Even during
finals week, student firemen were
routed out of bed at 1 and 2 a.m.,
and interrupted in their studies.
Equipment was rushed back and
forth, and much time was spent in
getting everything ready for another
call.
Little need be said about the child
ishness and the consequent dangers
involved in turning in false alarms,
but Fire Chief John Marston
summed up the whole situation
with this message:
"The party or parties who are re- I
sponsible for these false alarms ap
parently think it is a joke, but if

one of our firemen is injured or
killed in answering one of these
alarms it will certainly be a very
costly joke.
"Furthermore, if a real fire
breaks out while the department
is responding to a false alarm, the

time lost in rerouting the equip
ment may mean the difference in
saving someone trapped in a burn
ing building, or the loss of the
building itself, due to the delay
in reaching the scene."
It is hard to believe that a Stan
ford student would be guilty of such
actions if only for the reason that
the fire department is manned
largely by his fellow students; but
how can anyone turn in an alarm
in fun, if he realizes it may cost
someone's life? As a matter of fact,
more firemen are killed in answering
false alarms than are killed in fight
ing fires.
It is hardly necessary to mention
the serious consequences for turn
ing in false alarms.
