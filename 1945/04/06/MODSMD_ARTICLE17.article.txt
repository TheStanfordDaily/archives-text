# Herre Discusses Philippine Ecomomic Rehabilitation
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
That rehabilitation is the keynote
to the Philippine Islands' economic
development in the post-war world
for many years to come was the
theme of Albert W. C. T. Herre's in
terview with the Daily yesterday.
Mr. Herre lived in the Philippines
, for many years as chief of the Di
vision of Fisheries for the Bureau
of Science of the Philippine govern
ment. Although he left the Orient
1G years ago. he has done much trav
eling in that region since then.
"The Japanese occupation dis
rupted the Philippines' economics
tremendously," he said, adding that
for the moment the most pressing
problem of American participa
tion in rehabilitation is to feed and
clothe the people. Besides having
to import some foodstuffs, the
Philippines have to import almost
all cotton textiles and silk.
"The clothing situation is very bad
there now, and the food situation is
not so good," he said.
(Under the Tydings-McDullie Act.
the Philippine Islands have been
j guaranteed independence in 194G;
I and although proposals have been
! made to postpone the independence
I grant until the war is over and the

islands are once again on their feet,
the Philippine government under
Ihc leadership of President Sergio
Osmena has been quietly plugging
for independence in 194(5 regardless
of the war, according to a recent
issue of Time magazine.)
Whether or not the Tydings-
McDuffie guarantee goes through
in the year stipulated, certain
sugar, dairy, and other United
States economic interests have a
movement under way to cut oIT
Philippine markets in the United
States. But, says Mr. Herre, "it
will be very difficult to rehabilitate
the islands without the co-opera
tion of the United States. If our
government cuts off their markets
here, matters will be exceedingly
serious for the Philippines."
"We need many products they can
send us and they, in turn, need many
products we can send them. We need
manganese, chromium, copra, abaca
(a fiber usdd to make the best rope
cordage in the world), lumber, and
many other islands products. We
can supply them with machinery,
foods, and textiles."
To illustrate his point. Mr. Herre
gave the instance of the Philippines'
need for evaporated milk. All milk

and dairy products used in the Phil
ippines, with very minor exceptions,
come from the United States. "Yet,"'
said Mr. Herre, "dairymen here have
been bamboozled into helping cut
them out of markets here — disre
garding the fact that the best mar
ket for evaporated milk, outside of
the United States, is the Philippine
Islands."
In connection with the develop
ment of the Philippines' home eco
nomic development, Mr. Herre said
that the growing of rice, one of
the staple crops of the islands, and
the bringing of more land under
cultivation and irrigation are
among the first things to demand
the attention of the Philippine gov
ernment.
"With this," he added, "must go
the redevelopment and expansion of
Ihc fishing industry, for fish supply
the animal protein necessary to pro
vide a balanced diet for the Filipino
neonle. The introduction of keel
l built boats, new ncls, and modern
methods of fishing is necessary to
this development.
"Japanese fishermen held an im
portant position in the fishing be
fore the war, not only in the Philip
pine Islands but also in all the Ma

lay islands as well. If the Filipinos
are going to feed themselves, they
must bring their methods up to date,
so they can get their living from the
open sea rather than from along the
shore.
"They must replace Japanese
methods of fishing; otherwise in
20 to .'5O years Japanese fishermen
will again have to supply the peo
ple with food,*' he said.
Hand in hand with economic de
velopment must go the rebuilding ol
the practically destroyed city of Ma
nila and the other cities and towns
damaged or wiped out by I he war.
"In addition to army activities in the
retaking of the Philippine Islands,"
said Mr. Herre, "the Japanese de
stroyed an enormous number of
buildings and other property.
"But. next to food, the most vital
thing to undertake is the develop
i mcnt of transportation. In an is
land world, transportation is the
most vital of public necessities.
The repair of damaged roads is not
I so had except for the replacement
of destroyed bridges; hut the rail
i roads and their rolling stock must
I he rehabilitated, and many boats—
from all si7.es to 1,000 and 1,500
1 tons—are badly need for inter

island traffic."
Another rehabilitation project that
"will be a very great burden" to
rehabilitation authorities is the
building up of the educational sys
tem. The Philippines abound with
concrete schoolhouses which the
Japanese used as forts or barracks
and practically all of these were de
stroyed by the Japanese when they
were forced out, said Mr. Herre.
"It is probable," he declared, "that
few texts survived" Ihe occupation.
"One of the first things the Japanese
do when they obtain control of a
territory is to compel the people to
use Japanese. Many books in Eng
lish were destroyed by the occupa
tion forces in public bonfires."
In the clothing line, lie added,
the Filipinos need cheap, good cot
ton cloth "even more than we do;
and the man who will supply shoes
at a price the Filipinos can afford
to pay will confer a blessing upon
them."
"Few people," he alTirmed, 'real
ize what a safeguard against many
I diseases shoes are."
One of the serious problems before
I Philippines authorities in the field of
! agricultural recovery, however, is to
find something to replace the pro
duction of sugar, declared Mr. Herre.
"The restricted market in the United
States and general conditions else
where will make it impossible to sell
the sugar that can readily be pro
duced there."
Since rice and sugar constitute
the main crops of an agrarian Phil
ippines population that has more
than doubled since American
forces originally occupied the is
lands, the conversion of the sugar
crop to another potential and more
necessary staple will constitute a
problem not yet solved by Philip
pines authorities.
With the introduction of American
methods of sanitation and of the
products of American medical sci
ence, such population killers as ty
phoid, cholera, smallpox, and others
have virtually disappeared from the
Filipinos' disease diet; and today the
Filipinos have the highest standard
of living of any Oriental peoples.
"The material resources of the
Philippines arc great," said Mr.
Herre, "but they have been ter
ribly devastated: and it will take

a long, bitter struggle by the Fili
pinos and much sympathy and fi
nancial aid from the United States
to restore what was destroyed and
to build for the future."
As an example Mr. Herre cited the
fact that Japanese forces wrecked
nearly all Philippine mines, either
taking the machinery or smashing
it. "Some of the gold mines, how
ever, will be put in operation as soon
as their management can obtain the
necessary equipment," he added.
Gold is one of the chief mineral
resources of the islands.
Who is going to carry out the
long and arduous task of virtually
rebuilding the Philippine Islands?
In answer to this question Mr.
Herre stated that the Philippines
government is making extensive
plans for rehabilitation of the war
devastated archipelago. It expects
to finance these developments
through loans apparently already
secured from (lie United States, lie
said.
Except for restoring damaged
army and naval bases, however,
the American government will
probably take little direct part in
the rehabilitation program of the
Philippines, Mr. Ilerre declared.
Instead, a large part of the eco
nomic redevelopment of the is
lands will be undertaken by pri
vate businesses and corporations
already established in the islands
before the war and eager to return
to take a share in the great post
war economic development certain
to occur.
Since coming to Stanford, Mr.
Herre has held the post of curator
of ichthyology in the University's
Natural History Museum.

as their management can obtain the
necessary equipment," he added.
Gold is one of the chief mineral
resources of the islands.
Who is going to carry out the
long and arduous task of virtually
rebuilding the Philippine Islands?
In answer to this question Mr.
Herre stated that the Philippines
government is making extensive
plans for rehabilitation of the war
devastated archipelago. It expects
to finance these developments
through loans apparently already
secured from (lie United States, lie
said.
Except for restoring damaged
army and naval bases, however,
the American government will
probably take little direct part in
the rehabilitation program of the
Philippines, Mr. Ilerre declared.
Instead, a large part of the eco
nomic redevelopment of the is
lands will be undertaken by pri
vate businesses and corporations
already established in the islands
before the war and eager to return
to take a share in the great post
war economic development certain
to occur.
Since coming to Stanford, Mr.
Herre has held the post of curator
of ichthyology in the University's
Natural History Museum.
That rehabilitation is the keynote
to the Philippine Islands' economic
development in the post-war world
for many years to come was the
theme of Albert W. C. T. Herre's in
terview with the Daily yesterday.
Mr. Herre lived in the Philippines
, for many years as chief of the Di
vision of Fisheries for the Bureau
of Science of the Philippine govern
ment. Although he left the Orient
1G years ago. he has done much trav
eling in that region since then.
"The Japanese occupation dis
rupted the Philippines' economics
tremendously," he said, adding that
for the moment the most pressing
problem of American participa
tion in rehabilitation is to feed and
clothe the people. Besides having
to import some foodstuffs, the
Philippines have to import almost
all cotton textiles and silk.
"The clothing situation is very bad
there now, and the food situation is
not so good," he said.
(Under the Tydings-McDullie Act.
the Philippine Islands have been
j guaranteed independence in 194G;
I and although proposals have been
! made to postpone the independence
I grant until the war is over and the

islands are once again on their feet,
the Philippine government under
Ihc leadership of President Sergio
Osmena has been quietly plugging
for independence in 194(5 regardless
of the war, according to a recent
issue of Time magazine.)
Whether or not the Tydings-
McDuffie guarantee goes through
in the year stipulated, certain
sugar, dairy, and other United
States economic interests have a
movement under way to cut oIT
Philippine markets in the United
States. But, says Mr. Herre, "it
will be very difficult to rehabilitate
the islands without the co-opera
tion of the United States. If our
government cuts off their markets
here, matters will be exceedingly
serious for the Philippines."
"We need many products they can
send us and they, in turn, need many
products we can send them. We need
manganese, chromium, copra, abaca
(a fiber usdd to make the best rope
cordage in the world), lumber, and
many other islands products. We
can supply them with machinery,
foods, and textiles."
To illustrate his point. Mr. Herre
gave the instance of the Philippines'
need for evaporated milk. All milk

and dairy products used in the Phil
ippines, with very minor exceptions,
come from the United States. "Yet,"'
said Mr. Herre, "dairymen here have
been bamboozled into helping cut
them out of markets here — disre
garding the fact that the best mar
ket for evaporated milk, outside of
the United States, is the Philippine
Islands."
In connection with the develop
ment of the Philippines' home eco
nomic development, Mr. Herre said
that the growing of rice, one of
the staple crops of the islands, and
the bringing of more land under
cultivation and irrigation are
among the first things to demand
the attention of the Philippine gov
ernment.
"With this," he added, "must go
the redevelopment and expansion of
Ihc fishing industry, for fish supply
the animal protein necessary to pro
vide a balanced diet for the Filipino
neonle. The introduction of keel
l built boats, new ncls, and modern
methods of fishing is necessary to
this development.
"Japanese fishermen held an im
portant position in the fishing be
fore the war, not only in the Philip
pine Islands but also in all the Ma

lay islands as well. If the Filipinos
are going to feed themselves, they
must bring their methods up to date,
so they can get their living from the
open sea rather than from along the
shore.
"They must replace Japanese
methods of fishing; otherwise in
20 to .'5O years Japanese fishermen
will again have to supply the peo
ple with food,*' he said.
Hand in hand with economic de
velopment must go the rebuilding ol
the practically destroyed city of Ma
nila and the other cities and towns
damaged or wiped out by I he war.
"In addition to army activities in the
retaking of the Philippine Islands,"
said Mr. Herre, "the Japanese de
stroyed an enormous number of
buildings and other property.
"But. next to food, the most vital
thing to undertake is the develop
i mcnt of transportation. In an is
land world, transportation is the
most vital of public necessities.
The repair of damaged roads is not
I so had except for the replacement
of destroyed bridges; hut the rail
i roads and their rolling stock must
I he rehabilitated, and many boats—
from all si7.es to 1,000 and 1,500
1 tons—are badly need for inter

island traffic."
Another rehabilitation project that
"will be a very great burden" to
rehabilitation authorities is the
building up of the educational sys
tem. The Philippines abound with
concrete schoolhouses which the
Japanese used as forts or barracks
and practically all of these were de
stroyed by the Japanese when they
were forced out, said Mr. Herre.
"It is probable," he declared, "that
few texts survived" Ihe occupation.
"One of the first things the Japanese
do when they obtain control of a
territory is to compel the people to
use Japanese. Many books in Eng
lish were destroyed by the occupa
tion forces in public bonfires."
In the clothing line, lie added,
the Filipinos need cheap, good cot
ton cloth "even more than we do;
and the man who will supply shoes
at a price the Filipinos can afford
to pay will confer a blessing upon
them."
"Few people," he alTirmed, 'real
ize what a safeguard against many
I diseases shoes are."
One of the serious problems before
I Philippines authorities in the field of
! agricultural recovery, however, is to
find something to replace the pro
duction of sugar, declared Mr. Herre.
"The restricted market in the United
States and general conditions else
where will make it impossible to sell
the sugar that can readily be pro
duced there."
Since rice and sugar constitute
the main crops of an agrarian Phil
ippines population that has more
than doubled since American
forces originally occupied the is
lands, the conversion of the sugar
crop to another potential and more
necessary staple will constitute a
problem not yet solved by Philip
pines authorities.
With the introduction of American
methods of sanitation and of the
products of American medical sci
ence, such population killers as ty
phoid, cholera, smallpox, and others
have virtually disappeared from the
Filipinos' disease diet; and today the
Filipinos have the highest standard
of living of any Oriental peoples.
"The material resources of the
Philippines arc great," said Mr.
Herre, "but they have been ter
ribly devastated: and it will take

a long, bitter struggle by the Fili
pinos and much sympathy and fi
nancial aid from the United States
to restore what was destroyed and
to build for the future."
As an example Mr. Herre cited the
fact that Japanese forces wrecked
nearly all Philippine mines, either
taking the machinery or smashing
it. "Some of the gold mines, how
ever, will be put in operation as soon
as their management can obtain the
necessary equipment," he added.
Gold is one of the chief mineral
resources of the islands.

ippines population that has more
than doubled since American
forces originally occupied the is
lands, the conversion of the sugar
crop to another potential and more
necessary staple will constitute a
problem not yet solved by Philip
pines authorities.
With the introduction of American
methods of sanitation and of the
products of American medical sci
ence, such population killers as ty
phoid, cholera, smallpox, and others
have virtually disappeared from the
Filipinos' disease diet; and today the
Filipinos have the highest standard
of living of any Oriental peoples.
"The material resources of the
Philippines arc great," said Mr.
Herre, "but they have been ter
ribly devastated: and it will take

a long, bitter struggle by the Fili
pinos and much sympathy and fi
nancial aid from the United States
to restore what was destroyed and
to build for the future."
As an example Mr. Herre cited the
fact that Japanese forces wrecked
nearly all Philippine mines, either
taking the machinery or smashing
it. "Some of the gold mines, how
ever, will be put in operation as soon
as their management can obtain the
necessary equipment," he added.
Gold is one of the chief mineral
resources of the islands.
Who is going to carry out the
long and arduous task of virtually
rebuilding the Philippine Islands?
In answer to this question Mr.
Herre stated that the Philippines
government is making extensive
plans for rehabilitation of the war
devastated archipelago. It expects
to finance these developments
through loans apparently already
secured from (lie United States, lie
said.
Except for restoring damaged
army and naval bases, however,
the American government will
probably take little direct part in
the rehabilitation program of the
Philippines, Mr. Ilerre declared.
Instead, a large part of the eco
nomic redevelopment of the is
lands will be undertaken by pri
vate businesses and corporations
already established in the islands
before the war and eager to return
to take a share in the great post
war economic development certain
to occur.
Since coming to Stanford, Mr.
Herre has held the post of curator
of ichthyology in the University's
Natural History Museum.
That rehabilitation is the keynote
to the Philippine Islands' economic
development in the post-war world
for many years to come was the
theme of Albert W. C. T. Herre's in
terview with the Daily yesterday.
Mr. Herre lived in the Philippines
, for many years as chief of the Di
vision of Fisheries for the Bureau
of Science of the Philippine govern
ment. Although he left the Orient
1G years ago. he has done much trav
eling in that region since then.
"The Japanese occupation dis
rupted the Philippines' economics
tremendously," he said, adding that
for the moment the most pressing
problem of American participa
tion in rehabilitation is to feed and
clothe the people. Besides having
to import some foodstuffs, the
Philippines have to import almost
all cotton textiles and silk.
"The clothing situation is very bad
there now, and the food situation is
not so good," he said.
(Under the Tydings-McDullie Act.
the Philippine Islands have been
j guaranteed independence in 194G;
I and although proposals have been
! made to postpone the independence
I grant until the war is over and the

islands are once again on their feet,
the Philippine government under
Ihc leadership of President Sergio
Osmena has been quietly plugging
for independence in 194(5 regardless
of the war, according to a recent
issue of Time magazine.)
Whether or not the Tydings-
McDuffie guarantee goes through
in the year stipulated, certain
sugar, dairy, and other United
States economic interests have a
movement under way to cut oIT
Philippine markets in the United
States. But, says Mr. Herre, "it
will be very difficult to rehabilitate
the islands without the co-opera
tion of the United States. If our
government cuts off their markets
here, matters will be exceedingly
serious for the Philippines."
"We need many products they can
send us and they, in turn, need many
products we can send them. We need
manganese, chromium, copra, abaca
(a fiber usdd to make the best rope
cordage in the world), lumber, and
many other islands products. We
can supply them with machinery,
foods, and textiles."
To illustrate his point. Mr. Herre
gave the instance of the Philippines'
need for evaporated milk. All milk

and dairy products used in the Phil
ippines, with very minor exceptions,
come from the United States. "Yet,"'
said Mr. Herre, "dairymen here have
been bamboozled into helping cut
them out of markets here — disre
garding the fact that the best mar
ket for evaporated milk, outside of
the United States, is the Philippine
Islands."
In connection with the develop
ment of the Philippines' home eco
nomic development, Mr. Herre said
that the growing of rice, one of
the staple crops of the islands, and
the bringing of more land under
cultivation and irrigation are
among the first things to demand
the attention of the Philippine gov
ernment.
"With this," he added, "must go
the redevelopment and expansion of
Ihc fishing industry, for fish supply
the animal protein necessary to pro
vide a balanced diet for the Filipino
neonle. The introduction of keel
l built boats, new ncls, and modern
methods of fishing is necessary to
this development.
"Japanese fishermen held an im
portant position in the fishing be
fore the war, not only in the Philip
pine Islands but also in all the Ma

lay islands as well. If the Filipinos
are going to feed themselves, they
must bring their methods up to date,
so they can get their living from the
open sea rather than from along the
shore.
"They must replace Japanese
methods of fishing; otherwise in
20 to .'5O years Japanese fishermen
will again have to supply the peo
ple with food,*' he said.
Hand in hand with economic de
velopment must go the rebuilding ol
the practically destroyed city of Ma
nila and the other cities and towns
damaged or wiped out by I he war.
"In addition to army activities in the
retaking of the Philippine Islands,"
said Mr. Herre, "the Japanese de
stroyed an enormous number of
buildings and other property.
"But. next to food, the most vital
thing to undertake is the develop
i mcnt of transportation. In an is
land world, transportation is the
most vital of public necessities.
The repair of damaged roads is not
I so had except for the replacement
of destroyed bridges; hut the rail
i roads and their rolling stock must
I he rehabilitated, and many boats—
from all si7.es to 1,000 and 1,500
1 tons—are badly need for inter

island traffic."
Another rehabilitation project that
"will be a very great burden" to
rehabilitation authorities is the
building up of the educational sys
tem. The Philippines abound with
concrete schoolhouses which the
Japanese used as forts or barracks
and practically all of these were de
stroyed by the Japanese when they
were forced out, said Mr. Herre.
"It is probable," he declared, "that
few texts survived" Ihe occupation.
"One of the first things the Japanese
do when they obtain control of a
territory is to compel the people to
use Japanese. Many books in Eng
lish were destroyed by the occupa
tion forces in public bonfires."
In the clothing line, lie added,
the Filipinos need cheap, good cot
ton cloth "even more than we do;
and the man who will supply shoes
at a price the Filipinos can afford
to pay will confer a blessing upon
them."
"Few people," he alTirmed, 'real
ize what a safeguard against many
I diseases shoes are."
One of the serious problems before
I Philippines authorities in the field of
! agricultural recovery, however, is to
find something to replace the pro
duction of sugar, declared Mr. Herre.
"The restricted market in the United
States and general conditions else
where will make it impossible to sell
the sugar that can readily be pro
duced there."
Since rice and sugar constitute
the main crops of an agrarian Phil
ippines population that has more
than doubled since American
forces originally occupied the is
lands, the conversion of the sugar
crop to another potential and more
necessary staple will constitute a
problem not yet solved by Philip

few texts survived" Ihe occupation.
"One of the first things the Japanese
do when they obtain control of a
territory is to compel the people to
use Japanese. Many books in Eng
lish were destroyed by the occupa
tion forces in public bonfires."
In the clothing line, lie added,
the Filipinos need cheap, good cot
ton cloth "even more than we do;
and the man who will supply shoes
at a price the Filipinos can afford
to pay will confer a blessing upon
them."
"Few people," he alTirmed, 'real
ize what a safeguard against many
I diseases shoes are."
One of the serious problems before
I Philippines authorities in the field of
! agricultural recovery, however, is to
find something to replace the pro
duction of sugar, declared Mr. Herre.
"The restricted market in the United
States and general conditions else
where will make it impossible to sell
the sugar that can readily be pro
duced there."
Since rice and sugar constitute
the main crops of an agrarian Phil
ippines population that has more
than doubled since American
forces originally occupied the is
lands, the conversion of the sugar
crop to another potential and more
necessary staple will constitute a
problem not yet solved by Philip
pines authorities.
With the introduction of American
methods of sanitation and of the
products of American medical sci
ence, such population killers as ty
phoid, cholera, smallpox, and others
have virtually disappeared from the
Filipinos' disease diet; and today the
Filipinos have the highest standard
of living of any Oriental peoples.
"The material resources of the
Philippines arc great," said Mr.
Herre, "but they have been ter
ribly devastated: and it will take

a long, bitter struggle by the Fili
pinos and much sympathy and fi
nancial aid from the United States
to restore what was destroyed and
to build for the future."
As an example Mr. Herre cited the
fact that Japanese forces wrecked
nearly all Philippine mines, either
taking the machinery or smashing
it. "Some of the gold mines, how
ever, will be put in operation as soon
as their management can obtain the
necessary equipment," he added.
Gold is one of the chief mineral
resources of the islands.
Who is going to carry out the
long and arduous task of virtually
rebuilding the Philippine Islands?
In answer to this question Mr.
Herre stated that the Philippines
government is making extensive
plans for rehabilitation of the war
devastated archipelago. It expects
to finance these developments
through loans apparently already
secured from (lie United States, lie
said.
Except for restoring damaged
army and naval bases, however,
the American government will
probably take little direct part in
the rehabilitation program of the
Philippines, Mr. Ilerre declared.
Instead, a large part of the eco
nomic redevelopment of the is
lands will be undertaken by pri
vate businesses and corporations
already established in the islands
before the war and eager to return
to take a share in the great post
war economic development certain
to occur.
Since coming to Stanford, Mr.
Herre has held the post of curator
of ichthyology in the University's
Natural History Museum.
That rehabilitation is the keynote
to the Philippine Islands' economic
development in the post-war world
for many years to come was the
theme of Albert W. C. T. Herre's in
terview with the Daily yesterday.
Mr. Herre lived in the Philippines
, for many years as chief of the Di
vision of Fisheries for the Bureau
of Science of the Philippine govern
ment. Although he left the Orient
1G years ago. he has done much trav
eling in that region since then.
"The Japanese occupation dis
rupted the Philippines' economics
tremendously," he said, adding that
for the moment the most pressing
problem of American participa
tion in rehabilitation is to feed and
clothe the people. Besides having
to import some foodstuffs, the
Philippines have to import almost
all cotton textiles and silk.
"The clothing situation is very bad
there now, and the food situation is
not so good," he said.
(Under the Tydings-McDullie Act.
the Philippine Islands have been
j guaranteed independence in 194G;
I and although proposals have been
! made to postpone the independence
I grant until the war is over and the

islands are once again on their feet,
the Philippine government under
Ihc leadership of President Sergio
Osmena has been quietly plugging
for independence in 194(5 regardless
of the war, according to a recent
issue of Time magazine.)
Whether or not the Tydings-
McDuffie guarantee goes through
in the year stipulated, certain
sugar, dairy, and other United
States economic interests have a
movement under way to cut oIT
Philippine markets in the United
States. But, says Mr. Herre, "it
will be very difficult to rehabilitate
the islands without the co-opera
tion of the United States. If our
government cuts off their markets
here, matters will be exceedingly
serious for the Philippines."
"We need many products they can
send us and they, in turn, need many
products we can send them. We need
manganese, chromium, copra, abaca
(a fiber usdd to make the best rope
cordage in the world), lumber, and
many other islands products. We
can supply them with machinery,
foods, and textiles."
To illustrate his point. Mr. Herre
gave the instance of the Philippines'
need for evaporated milk. All milk

and dairy products used in the Phil
ippines, with very minor exceptions,
come from the United States. "Yet,"'
said Mr. Herre, "dairymen here have
been bamboozled into helping cut
them out of markets here — disre
garding the fact that the best mar
ket for evaporated milk, outside of
the United States, is the Philippine
Islands."
In connection with the develop
ment of the Philippines' home eco
nomic development, Mr. Herre said
that the growing of rice, one of
the staple crops of the islands, and
the bringing of more land under
cultivation and irrigation are
among the first things to demand
the attention of the Philippine gov
ernment.
"With this," he added, "must go
the redevelopment and expansion of
Ihc fishing industry, for fish supply
the animal protein necessary to pro
vide a balanced diet for the Filipino
neonle. The introduction of keel
l built boats, new ncls, and modern
methods of fishing is necessary to
this development.
"Japanese fishermen held an im
portant position in the fishing be
fore the war, not only in the Philip
pine Islands but also in all the Ma

lay islands as well. If the Filipinos
are going to feed themselves, they
must bring their methods up to date,
so they can get their living from the
open sea rather than from along the
shore.
"They must replace Japanese
methods of fishing; otherwise in
20 to .'5O years Japanese fishermen
will again have to supply the peo
ple with food,*' he said.
Hand in hand with economic de
velopment must go the rebuilding ol
the practically destroyed city of Ma
nila and the other cities and towns
damaged or wiped out by I he war.
"In addition to army activities in the
retaking of the Philippine Islands,"
said Mr. Herre, "the Japanese de
stroyed an enormous number of
buildings and other property.

Another rehabilitation project that

rehabilitation authorities is the
building up of the educational sys

concrete schoolhouses which the
Japanese used as forts or barracks
and practically all of these were de

were forced out, said Mr. Herre.
