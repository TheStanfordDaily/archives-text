## 
### 
Referendum to the student voters
will be held Tuesday to determine
whether or not the present method
of representation on Executive Com
mittee should be replaced by the
area system proposed last quarter
and explained in the Daily.
In an attempt to make clear the
proposal on which eveiy student will
be asked to vote, the Daily has print
ed the above diagram, showing on
the left the suggested machinery;
| on the right, the present machinery
| of student government.
In order to provide a direct chain
of responsibility from the student
body as a whole to the student
officers who represent them, voters
in areas by living group would
determine who should represent
them, according to the new plan.
These Excom members would meet
j once a week with the house presi
dents in the group which they rep
i resent; the presidents will be thus
; responsible for the performance of
their representatives, and the repre
j sentatives may in turn be assured
that the problems befoi'e Excom will
be carried to the students for opin
| ions and reactions. If the groups
have any requests or problems, they
know to whom they should go in
order to have them presented before
Excom.
At present, as may be seen by
the diagram, the student body
elects the members of Excom, but
has no direct way provided in
which to meet with or hear from
the members representing them.
As ex-ollicio members of Excom,
Women's Conference president
and Men s Interhall Council pres
ident hear the student issues ?nd
j transmit them in minimum form to
house presidents at the weekly
meetings, and if they hear student
reaction at all, it is late, and it is

without the power to express at
Excom the students' desires with
a vole.
If the referendum results in a vote
in favor of the new plan, the spring
quarter election, to be held April 25,
will incorporate into it the newly
created offices, abolishing the old.
Representation of off-campus stu
dents, both graduate and under-rad
uate, was provided for at last night's
Excom meeting, and the office of
graduate member on Excom, voted
for by the student body at large, was
confirmed.
Representatives are now chosen by
class; this system would be partially
perpetuated by the grouping of the
freshman living groups together for
voting. Should the proposal be
passed, definite assignment of living
groups according to area would be
provided by Excom.

passed, definite assignment of living
groups according to area would be
provided by Excom.

Referendum to the student voters
will be held Tuesday to determine
whether or not the present method
of representation on Executive Com
mittee should be replaced by the
area system proposed last quarter
and explained in the Daily.
In an attempt to make clear the
proposal on which eveiy student will
be asked to vote, the Daily has print
ed the above diagram, showing on
the left the suggested machinery;
| on the right, the present machinery
| of student government.
In order to provide a direct chain
of responsibility from the student
body as a whole to the student
officers who represent them, voters
in areas by living group would
determine who should represent
them, according to the new plan.
These Excom members would meet
j once a week with the house presi
dents in the group which they rep
i resent; the presidents will be thus
; responsible for the performance of
their representatives, and the repre
j sentatives may in turn be assured
that the problems befoi'e Excom will
be carried to the students for opin
| ions and reactions. If the groups
have any requests or problems, they
know to whom they should go in
order to have them presented before
Excom.
At present, as may be seen by
the diagram, the student body
elects the members of Excom, but
has no direct way provided in
which to meet with or hear from
the members representing them.
As ex-ollicio members of Excom,
Women's Conference president
and Men s Interhall Council pres
ident hear the student issues ?nd
j transmit them in minimum form to
house presidents at the weekly
meetings, and if they hear student
reaction at all, it is late, and it is

without the power to express at
Excom the students' desires with
a vole.
If the referendum results in a vote
in favor of the new plan, the spring
quarter election, to be held April 25,
will incorporate into it the newly
created offices, abolishing the old.
Representation of off-campus stu
dents, both graduate and under-rad
uate, was provided for at last night's
Excom meeting, and the office of
graduate member on Excom, voted
for by the student body at large, was
confirmed.
Representatives are now chosen by
class; this system would be partially
perpetuated by the grouping of the
freshman living groups together for
voting. Should the proposal be
passed, definite assignment of living
groups according to area would be
provided by Excom.
