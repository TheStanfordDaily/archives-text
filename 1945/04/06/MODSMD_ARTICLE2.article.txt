# Reds Break Jap Treaty, Plan Attack
## 
### 
LONDONâ€”Russia denounced her neutrality treaty with Japan ;
today a few hours after the Japanese cabinet resigned in disgrace I
and the Siberia-Manchuria frontier became automatically a poten
tial war theater in which Russia has a powerful army only 570
miles from Tokyo.
Military and diplomatic leaders believed Japan, regarding war
with Russia as inevitable, might take the initiative and attack Si
beria in a blind, desperate gamble to ward off the threatening
disaster of the American air and sea offensive from the east and
south being augmented by a tremendous Russian land offensive |
from the west.
Russia implicitly accused Japan of breaking the neutrality pact
by aiding Germany while the Nazis were at war against the
Soviet Union.
Just before the announcement, General Premier Koiso and
his cabinet submitted their collective resignations to Japan's em
peror. The emperor put the fate of his nation in the hands of |
Admiral Baron Kantaro Suzuki, president of the privy council |
and former commander of the combined imperial fleet.
