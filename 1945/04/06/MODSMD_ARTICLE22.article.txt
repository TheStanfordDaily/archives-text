WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP).—
General Dwight Eisenhower believes
there is little possibility of Germany
formally capitulating and of all re
sistance ending quickly and at once,
the White House revealed today.
He thinks Victory-in-Europe Day
probably will come by his own proc
lamation announcing the end of or
ganized resistance in Germany. But
he foresees "a form of guerilla war
fare which would require for its
suppression a very large number of
troops."
