# TIME FOR ACTION

Now in the hands of administrative officials
is Housing Committee's recommendation of a
plan for housing of Stanford women which, if
approved, has a chance to promote a "unified
Stanford community wherein each living group
will feel that it is a part of a whole co-operative
effort"; a plan which, if approved, will involve
immediate mass effort of University women
toward mutual acquaintance, personally and in
dividually, and acquaintance also with the in
side workings and systems of all living units.
We're wondering just how many Stanford
women have taken the trouble to scrutinize
carefully the outline of the housing plan that
appeared in the last Daily edition of winter
quarter. That is the essential plan the com
mittee finally decided to submit to Dr. Tresid
der for consideration —a plan that emerged fi
nally from the confused mass of facts, opinions,
prejudices, and arguments presented at meet
ing after meeting of the group last quarter.
Included in the recommended plan, which is
based on straight lot system, are a few words
about some of the objectives: . . the facili
tation of congeniality within a residence so that
each woman may feel herself part of a friendly
group ... the formulation of a new social policy
which will both unite all women's living groups
and provide a happy way of living for each
Stanford woman . . ."
All fine sounding words, but words that will
mean nothing unless they are thought about
and believed.
The committee recommended that former so
rority houses be allowed to maintain their pres
ent co-operative system and that other small
units be developed for co-operative living as
soon as possible. . . . The committee recom-'
mended that more extensive group spirit be
organized and maintained in larger living
groups.
More fine ideals, which cannot be carried
out without general campus support.
That's why we want immediate action on a
problem that has been left in the air too long.
Freshman and upper class women must have
some basis for future plans. And the manner in
which today's problem is solved will have far
ther reaching effects than the mere distribu
tion of Stanford's largest class of freshman
women. The way in which the present issue is
handled by administration and students can
pull the campus apart, causing more bitterness,
prejudice, and bigotry than ever before; an un
derstanding and acceptance of the points ex
pressed in the Housing Committee's recom
mended plan can give incentive and encour
agement to individual and living group work in
promoting that unified, congenial Stanford com
munity. Immediate action on the plan's ap
proval and thorough plans for carrying it out
in spirit as well as in letter are required.—H. D.
