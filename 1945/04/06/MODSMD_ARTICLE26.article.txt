That page in the Reg Book about partial em
j ployment begins a train of thought. Out of the
fog, friends —don't be a butt-collector or a blis
ter major all your life! These are the parts
j where enterprise is free and as you surely
know, there are all kinds of enterprises that
won't subtract a second from your sun-time.
| (Cold in the shade, isn't it?)
' In fact, there are enterprises that go like
I little clocks in total darkness. How's for a dis
j cussion of the few that look all right in print?
For those who haven't mastered the new bus
schedule —and who has?—the tandem bicycle,
properly eguipped, offers a solid possibility.
The equipment — namely, one man — isn't as
simple as it sounds, but once you've got him
you're all fixed for renting the back half (of the
bicycle) to the fair and flat-footed along Santa
Teresa. The Lagunita corner is swarming with
'em.
Then there was the fly guy of years ago
(aren't they all?) who had the idea of a migra
tory quick-lunch joint for those half-dead hours
when the books are open and the Cellar is
closed. He was going to invest in one of those
contraptions, half bike and half bakery, with
an automatic coffee attachment; a pedaling per
colator.
As he scooted up and down the Row, blowing
his monogrammed whistle like crazy, the quar
ters would come skimming out the windows
and the eatables would go skimming in, a pretty
picture no matter how you look at it..The fly
guy was blown away by the draft before any
thing came of this, but the idea is on the market.
If you aren't the athletic type, there are
other fields—join the crowd in front of the First
Nat'l Bank in Paylo Alto and pick up some of
those bouncing checks. Or hire out as an egg
peeler in one of the hard-boiled beverage dis
pensaries down the highway. Or start another
Morning Newspaper on the Peninsula.
Note to all Junior Thunder Riders: Quit
milling around, fellas; my resignation is in the
mails, and you're wanted right away in the base
ment of the powah house before Smith turns
into a little wet spot under the coke machine.
Smith is a good woman. You can't go wrong
with Smith. And get those horses out of here!
