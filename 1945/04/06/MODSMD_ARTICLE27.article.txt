WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN GERMANY?
There arc four possibilities as to what the Germans
can do next. First of all, they might, try to disengage
their armies and retreat into the southern mountains,
there fighting their Valhalla. Secondly, they might jet
tison most of their forces, taking a few of the most
trusted units (such as Elite Guards and SS) into well
stocked mountain fortresses from which guerilla war
fare can be led. Third, they might try to stand along the
Elbe, now that the Weser has fallen, and fourth, they
might simply collapse.
The first is highly improbable for two reasons. First,
any sustained resistance would have to be supplied by
the limited war industry of Austria and northern Italy.
Austrian industry is divided, for the most part, between
five large cities, Vienna, Viener-Neustadt, Graz, and
Linz. The Russian invasion of that country has taken
one, Viener-Neustadt, and threatens another, Vienna,
whose fall will outflank a third, Graz. Also, the Rus
sians do not seem to be meeting too much resistance
in their advance, and they could very probably continue
their progress unabated up the valley of the Danube
to Linz. This would also neutralize the Italian factories,
since the Red Army would be across the rail and road
lines leading from them to the German army.
Secondly, the Germans would have to get out from
between a hammer and anvil before the two met, a
very difficult thing to do normally, and probably im
possible considering the extreme state of their disor
ganization. Their only chance was to try to hold the
two apart while they still had space enough to pull back
their head, and they failed to do this when they didn't
succeed in establishing a cohesive front along the
Weser.
GUERILLA WARFARE
As far as the second alternative in concerned, the
small pockets, this policy would be ineffective consider
ing that they could be easily contained. Also, guerilla
warfare's effectiveness depends on its degree of decen
tralization. When the story of most undergrounds of
Europe is told it might well be found that the leader
ship, if not divided, was certainly not static.
If we do decide to occupy Germany, there will un
doubtedly be small bands coming up to annoy us. With
a few years of either extremely good treatment or
extremely bad treatment (such as that practice which
our propaganda has so often condemned but which
is yet a very effective method to keep troops from be
ing ambushed by irresponsible elements, hostage shoot
ing), this should go down. There will be many officers
of the German army — mostly junior officers — who
will be unknown enough, patriotic enough, and well
enough trained, to start little irregular groups. Their
history will be quite like that of the Soilth's Ku Klux
Klan. in its infancy, but they will probably not be led
by the Nazis, as the Klan was not directed by the
leadership of the Confederacy. The old hierarchy will
be too well watched.
As for the collapse, that is undoubtedly the most
probable. As things stand now, it might be just a big
mop-up operation. A stand along the Elbe is possible,
but it could only change the length of the war from
days to weeks, at most. As for garrisons in such outly
ing places as Italy and Norway, they might surrender
or might have to he forced out, but the decision rests
with the realistic officers who command them, and
might, in many cases, be the former. The war in Ger
many is just about over, nnd the question is now, what
will be our postwar policy towards that nation?
