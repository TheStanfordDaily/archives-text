# 'Little Convention' Votes On 'Y' National Issues
## 
### 
In a sparkling, fast-moving ex
change of ideas last night at the
Y.W.C.A. "Little Convention", reco
mendations were voted upon to be
sent to the National "Y" as a sub
stitute for the usual national confer
ence.
The so-called "Little Convention"
took the principles underlying the
Public Affairs program sent by the
National "Y" and presented reports I
relating to the Stanford way of
thinking.
After a devotion given by Miss
Pat Davidson, "Y" secretary,
stressing the emigrant's feeling, "A
promise for tomorrow is America
to mc," the reports were read.
Mrs. Gerald Van Ilergen, execu
tive secretary of the Palo Alto Red
Cross, presented the Community
"Y" project, asking the question,
does Stanford's "Y" help to make
qualities and interest necessary to
"Y's" at home? The consensus of
opinion said that it did, aiding
the understanding of other racial
groups and furthering the knowl
edge of world affairs.
A National Finance report told j
of additional opportunities brought
about by the war to expand "Y"
services, better interpretative mate
rial concerning the "Y" so people j
will know what their donated money
has been used for, and announced
the contribution from Palo Alto and
Stanford last year as $840.
In discussing Stanford's stand on |
the principles underlying the Pub- i
lie Affairs program, Carol Kellogg,
chairman, said. "We believe that j
without doubt, the national Public !
Affairs Committee has picked up the [
crucial issues of the day, but we |

suggest that certain points be
stressed and be debated.
"We suggest an inter-American
and international education pro
gram whereby university students
and professors are exchanged. We
believe that if the U.S. and all the
other countries of the world are to
benefit from an international organi
zation, an attempt must be made for
the countries to have a better under- i
standing of the cultures and ways of
life of each other.
"No provision is made for de
ciding how 'just' taxes and prices 1
are determined and who shall de
ride the issue. . . .Of even greater |
concern to us was what the Na- j
tional Board is doing to get these I
principles adopted and actually put
into effect. . . . The World Af
fairs Committee of Stanford has
devoted most of its time to con
siderations of the Dumbarton Oaks
proposals, and the peace plans.
"With the coming of the United !
Nations Conference in San Francisco,
we will continue to devote much of
our discussions to this problem and
to those problems suggested to u.s by
a reading of these principles."

concern to us was what the Na- j
tional Board is doing to get these I
principles adopted and actually put
into effect. . . . The World Af

In a sparkling, fast-moving ex
change of ideas last night at the
Y.W.C.A. "Little Convention", reco
mendations were voted upon to be
sent to the National "Y" as a sub
stitute for the usual national confer
ence.
The so-called "Little Convention"
took the principles underlying the
Public Affairs program sent by the
National "Y" and presented reports I
relating to the Stanford way of
thinking.
After a devotion given by Miss
Pat Davidson, "Y" secretary,
stressing the emigrant's feeling, "A
promise for tomorrow is America
to mc," the reports were read.
Mrs. Gerald Van Ilergen, execu
tive secretary of the Palo Alto Red
Cross, presented the Community
"Y" project, asking the question,
does Stanford's "Y" help to make
qualities and interest necessary to
"Y's" at home? The consensus of
opinion said that it did, aiding
the understanding of other racial
groups and furthering the knowl
edge of world affairs.
A National Finance report told j
of additional opportunities brought
about by the war to expand "Y"
services, better interpretative mate
rial concerning the "Y" so people j
will know what their donated money
has been used for, and announced
the contribution from Palo Alto and
Stanford last year as $840.
In discussing Stanford's stand on |
the principles underlying the Pub- i
lie Affairs program, Carol Kellogg,
chairman, said. "We believe that j
without doubt, the national Public !
Affairs Committee has picked up the [
crucial issues of the day, but we |

suggest that certain points be
stressed and be debated.
"We suggest an inter-American
and international education pro
gram whereby university students
and professors are exchanged. We
believe that if the U.S. and all the
other countries of the world are to
benefit from an international organi
zation, an attempt must be made for
the countries to have a better under- i
standing of the cultures and ways of
life of each other.

ciding how 'just' taxes and prices 1
