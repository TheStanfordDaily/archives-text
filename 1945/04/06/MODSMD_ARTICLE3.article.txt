# Russ-Jap Break May Shorten War

WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP).â€”Military observers believed
tonight that Russia's denunciation of its neutrality pact with Japan
would shorten the Pacific war even if the Soviet Union does not
eventually join the U.S. and Great Britain as a Far Eastern ally.
An early declaration of war by Rssia is not expected, but there
was speculation that Japan may provoke hostilities before the
neutrality pact's termination date, April 25, 1946.
The experts said Japan must now prepare to fight Russia or
get ready to grant territorial concessions that would shrink the
empire alarmingly and render it still more impotent to stem the
American invasion forces closing in on the home islands.
