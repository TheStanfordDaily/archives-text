# The
						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
Your present scribe seems to have
started off the current quarter as
usual by placing himself behind the
well-known eight-ball as a result of
calling himself an ump. (If you don't
think tagging yourself as an ump is
a precarious position, try it at Eb
bets Field some time.) The osten
sible purpose of this move is to ana
lyze the various teams and cover the
pennant races as they unfold in the
two major leagues and the P.C.L. It
is the intention of our esteemed boss,
Mort Cohen, that standings and re
sults will be published every day,
Roos Bros, permitting; and that this
column shall appear every Friday
analyzing the week's events in base
ball.
At the present date the only cir
cuit officially in operation is our own
beloved Pacific Coast League, so I
shall devote my inaugural effort to
an analysis of the comparative merits
of its eight teams, a prediction of our
outcome of the hectic flag chase, and
a resume of the week's play.
Predictions
Having weighed carefully all the
evidence (and it's damned unreli
able in this league), I have come to
the following conclusion concerning
the standings of P.C.L. teams at the
end of the season in September:
1. Los Angeles
2. Portland
3. San Francisco
4. Seattle
5. Hollywood
(>. Oakland
7. Sacramento
8. San Diego

'Mgny may question the selection
of Bill Sweeney's Angels for the pen
nant this season, and with consider
able reason. At present Los Angeles
doesn't look too sharp, due to an ap
preciable shortage in the mound
staff. However, the Angels are a
member of the Chicago Cubs con
glomeration, and P. K. Wrigley has
a way of taking care of his minor
league outfits when they run into
difficulties. Last year, as fans will
remember, Wrigley drained off most
of L.A.'s talent to try to pull his Cubs
out of the cellar, and then, seeing
that the National League pennant
was still beyond reach, shipped most
of it back again in time to bring the
Angels back into first place and the
enampionship.
Aside from the battery staff, the
Angels look pretty solid and are per
fectly adapted to their peanut-sized
park, where everyone fattens his
home-run total and outfielders are
continually bashing out their brains
on the fence. Whether or not Swee
ney will be able to find sufficient
pitchers for his boys is the big ques
tion. There is plenty of power at the
plate, what with the mad Russian,
Novikoff, back with his alma mater
club.
Beavers Hot
Portland's Beavers are the team to
watch this season. Unlike most of
his competitors, Marv Owen has
enough hurling talent to last the sea
son out nicely, led by the venerable
Ad Liska, and plenty of punch be
sides. The Bevos' infield could stand
some improvement, and may prove
to be their Achilles' heel.
After innumerable experiments
with his draft-riddled infield last
year, Lefty O'Doul seems to have
at last come up with a workable
combination in Suhr ( Young, Futer
nick, and Trutta; and our own San
Francisco Seals look pretty solid on
paper, at least. Maybe those early
miscues in the field can be put down
to early-season tension. As usual,
Lefty is horribly short of hurlers,
and if he doesn't find a couple more
pretty soon he may have to kiss
good-bye to the first division. Ken
Brondell looked pretty fair to me last
Saturday, and the Seals still have
the reliable Bobby Joyce; but for the
rest — some super improvement is
needed, and fast. In rating them
third, I'm obviously counting on it.
A little more strength on the offen
sive wouldn't hurt.
Bill Skiff still has enough mound
talent up in Seattle to rate his Rai
niers a first division berth, but he'd
better teach his team the art of con
necting with the pill at the necessary
times if he wants to attain it.
Hollywood's Twinks are rated by
some pretty strong, but from per
sonal observation don't rate above
fifth with me. A new manager and
general mediocrity will set the Stars
back.
Oaks Wear
Dolph Camilli shouldn't expect too
much from his Acorns this season.
Oakland is practically void in
moundsmen. has few hitters, and is
rather ragged in the field.
The Sad Sacs of the capital city,
bums of the league, are still recov
ering from their dirty deal at the
hands of the Cardinals, and won't
blossom forth for a while yet. Earl
Sheeley's outfit has plenty of pep
per, if little else.
Pepper Martin might as well in
augurate a five-year plan with his
practically defunct San Diego Pa
dres, and then sit back and wait. He
certainly can't expect much in the
way of improvement this season with
a team that is a financial deficit to
its owners.
Bad Start
Well, that's how they look from
the umpire's position behind the
plate, and I am forced to admit that

the first week of play didn't tend to
confirm the umpire's verdict to any
great extent, although it did show
up several of the weaknesses indi
cated. In the inaugural series, Los
Angeles took the Seals, 3 games to
2, with the weaknesses of both teams
in the pitching department strongly
accentuated by the wild scores and
long hits. Sacramento defeated Hol
lywood to the same tune, as any
strength the Twinks may have,
failed to materialize for the moment.
Portland lived up to advance expec
tations by overcoming the Padres'
feeble resistance, 4 games to 1. The
Beavers continue to look good. The
Suds of Seattle handled Oakland the
same way, but look for more trouble
with Los Angeles.
Current series find Los Angeles
leading Seattle, Oakland ahead of
Hollywood, Portland beating Sacra
mento, and our Seals being edged by
San Diego, all by one game to none.
And with that, the ump sits back to
wait for the rain of oranges and coke
bottles.
