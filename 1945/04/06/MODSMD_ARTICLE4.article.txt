PARIS, Friday, April 6 (UP).â€”American Ninth infantry and j
tanks stormed over the Weser River yesterday after a 40-mile i
gain in 24 hours and drove on Hannover, while British spearheads
sped toward Bremen, 37 miles away. The U.S. Third Army, on
the direct road to Berlin, was 87 miles from the capital's home
province of Brandenburg.
The most advanced Third Army columns were 126 miles from
Berlin and within 62 miles of the Czechoslovakian border. The !
Germans were desperately trying to fall back to the Elbe River,
last defense line before Berlin.
