# Softball To Begin,' Wolter

### BOB SLOBE 
Three nines—or should we say
tens—have signed up for intra
mural softball on the sheet which
is posted in the men's gym. These
include Monroe, Tyler, and the Phi
Psi's.
However, a much larger signup is
expected before the end of the week,
and any organized group on campus
can participate in the league simply
by registering their name on the list.
Prompt signup is urged by Harry
Wolter, mural director, so that games
may begin in a week or two.
Little is known about the po
tentalities of the teams already
signed up. Monroe had a cham
pionship team last summer quar
ter, winning seven out of eight
games. The versatile Bob Itos
burg did the mound chores for
Monroe and managed to baffle all
but one of his opponents. Tyler
ended up far down the list with
one lone victory over Washington
in the last game of the season with
a score of 10-9. Tyler, perhaps,
had the best pitcher in the league,
Tom Egan. but they had little in
field or outfield support, and us
ually lacked a complete team to
play with. However, reports are
slipping the strict censorship of
the Tyler Moguls that say the
"Hilltoppers " have got a hot squad
coming up.
The Phi Psi squad will be able to
make use of both their first and sec
ond teams in basketball and will
probably put a fine team together
with Ashley, Hood, and Pitts again
being the boys to watch.
All games will be played on sunk
en diamond in early evening, one
game being played at each of the
four corners. Watch the Daily sports
page for further details about sched
ules and team lineups.
