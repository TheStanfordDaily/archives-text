# Jim Pollard Leads Coast Guard Squad
## 
### 
It seems very strange that Stan
ford, one of the many teams not en
tered in intercollegiate athletics,
should continue to be at the top of
the sports world, but that is just
the case. Without a doubt, two of
the outstanding basketball figures of
1944 were ex-Stanford men. Every
one knows about Howie Dallmar,
and how he led the University of
Pennsylvania to a championship sea
son. Most people also know that he
was considered to be the top player
of the East by the sports writers and
the greatest basketball player to be
seen since Hank Luisetti. His coach
stated that he had never coached a
better player.
Now another member of that ter
rific team of 1942, Jim Pollard, has
also been heard from. Pollard was
probably the most outstanding mem
ber of the team, and if he hadn't
taken sick during the finals of the
national championship, he would
have been a positive first string All-
American. As it was, he only gained
second string recognition. This year,
Pollard played in the Hawaiian
League in the Central Pacific Area
and was the outstanding player of
that section. It is gratifying to see
that even the war has not slowed
down his abilities.
After leaving Stanford for the
Coast Guard, Pollard was stationed
in the Bay Area. It was there that
he rose to his greatest fame, for he
was continually matched up against
Hank Luisetti. The people in San

Francisco will probably never forget
those great games between the two
dynamic figures of basketball. When
Pollard scored 23 points, Luisetti
setti pumped home 25 points, Pol
lard would put in 2(>. It was almost
mpossible to choose between them.
