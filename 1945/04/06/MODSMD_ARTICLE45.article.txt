"Therein lies a (ale. A tale of how
I a great Stanford team finally slopped
1 the Golden Bear's long uncomfor
j table string of victories. A tale of
. how two Stanford players, hearing
the brunt of a heavy burden, came
through and outplayed everything in
sight.
"It was a triumph of the Warner
system over the firmly established
Smith system. Not a triumph be
cause Stanford failed to win, but be
cause California had a chance to
win &nd didn't."
These words can be found in the
Daily Palo Alto. They constitute the
beginning of the story of what is
considered to be one of the greatest
story of the Big Game of 1924, the
Stanford team came from nowhere to
tie the mighty Golden Bears, 20-20.
And on that day, the new Stanford
coach, Pop Warner, issued his fa
mous prophecy: "It will be a long
time before Cal beats Stanford
again."
But you may ask why should we
bring this up after all these years?
The answer is simple: yesterday
Glenn S. Warner celebrated his 74th
birthday. We can think of no great
er tribute to his coaching career
than to re-enact that 1924 game, lor
although he led Stanford to contin
ued victories although he remained
at the top of his profession, al
though he coached some of the
greatest Ail-Americans, Pop Warner
never forgot that eventful day.
Facing California with a full squad
would have been bad enough, but
Stanford was going to play without
the services of its two top stars,
Ernie Nevers and Norm Cleveland.
That is why no one gave Stanford
even the slightest chance of holding
the Bears to less than two touch
downs, let along winning. The brunt
of the offense had to fall on Mur
ray Cuddenback; he had to do all
the running, kicking and passing.
Everyone knew that Murray would
be out there doing his best, but no
one expected him to put on a one
man exhibition of football. He was
everywhere, making yardage and
stopping Cal runs, making points,

[ and keeping Cal down to a mini- j
mum. And when, finally, with only
| seconds to go, Stanford scored twice j
i and tied up the game, the spectators !
stood speechless. In fact, a great
j many of them had already left and
! didn't find out the final score until
I their friends told them the next j
j day.
That way the day of days, the
i supreme moment of a great sea- j
son. Baker, the underrated Stan
; ford center continually outplayed
Babe Horrell, Call's Ail-American,
and Captain Jim Lawson played
his greatest game. Is it little won
der then that Coach Warner felt
| in the mood to prophesy?
In case you are interested, Pop
Warner's prediction came true; Cal
ifornia did not win another game
until eight years had passed, and
they won that game by a bare touch
down margin. Now Coach Warner,
who may be retired from actual
coaching but who is still tops in his
profession, makes another prediction.
He feels that the T formation, which
has been making such outstanding
progress in the last few years, will
not last. He feels that it depends j
too much on lucky punches, and j
that one of these days the old single- j
wing will come back and knock it
around. Only time will tell.
