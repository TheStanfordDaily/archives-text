# S.F. Peninsula Is Rising, Bay Sinking; Human Activities Molded by Geology

An alert Physical Sciences 5 stu
dent may already know that five
miles south of the Farm half of the
San Francisco peninsula is slipping
south while the other half is slip -
j ping north, but unless he was among
the 50 listeners to Dr. Bailey Wil
lis' talk yesterday afternoon he prob
ably doesn't know that the entire pe
| ninsula is rising while San Francisco
; Bay is sinking. No, we won't be
t breathing the rarefied atmosphere of
5,000 feet for a long time yet, but
: according to Dr. Willis every so of
ten (1906, for instance), some mys
| terious force in the interior of the
earth pushes a wedge of earth be
neath the surface which lifts one
j portion of land, lowering another.
j You're Resting on Geology?
Dr. Willis, one of Stanford's most
distinguished faculty members, be
gan his talk with the proposition that
i geology is the basis of human ac
! tivities. In support of it he sketched
in simple terms, three incidents in
geologic history; the formation of
San Francisco Bay and the Golden
Gate, the rise of the Sierra Neva
das, and the formation of Puget j
I Sound, mentioning first the difficulty j

most persons have in conceiving the
vast extent of geologic time.
The Golden Gate was once only
part of a valley forming the outlet
for the San Joaquin and another
central California river, Dr. Willis
said. San Francisco Bay is similar
to the harbors of Sydney, Australia,
and Rio de Janiero in this respect.
Granite Bubble Helps Stanford
Sixty million years ago the gold
rush, which was the cause of the
settlement of California and the
West, began when a "small" bubble
of molten granite burst from the
earth's interior to form the Sierra
Nevada Mountains. It brought to
the surface the gold that John Mar
shall discovered and Leland Stan
ford profited from. With time, ages
and ages, the high peaks were worn
down to a plateau. But, meanwhile,
volcanic disturbances had sent rivers
of lava pouring down .the mountain
sides leaving permanent traces, and
streams had washed the glittering
metal down into the valley for men
to find. Then the Sierras rose again
to form the present range on top of
which Dr. Willis said traces of the
j old plateau can still be seen.

Squatters Eat Too
Dr. Willis recollected the time
sixty years ago when he, an "inno
cent and ignorant" geology graduate
of the Columbia School of Mines, was
sent to the Northwest to find and
map the coal areas around Puget
Sound, for the Northern Pacific Rail
way. The young man, with several
comrades and five Winchester rifles
acquired the Black Diamond coal
mine for the railroad while the origi
nal "squatters" were out getting food.
"Puget Sound is a unique harbor
in that it was formed by a glacier
which in retreating and melting left
the long, narrow tongues of land de
pression which today are filled with
water," Dr. Willis said. The glacier,
which covered all of North America,
left gravel and stones on the land
and Dr. Willis recalled how he de
tected the various kinds of rock sur
face by the crunching sound of the
wheels of the buggy in which he was
riding. He said that he did not rec
ommend this as an efficient method
of geologic observation.
Emeritus since 1922
Professor Arthur E. Bestor, Jr.,
chairman of the Humanities commit
tee sponsoring the Symposium series,
introduced Dr. Willis, professor of
geology, emeritus, since 1922. Dr.
Willis was the son of W. P. Willis,
a literary man of the early nine
teenth century. He was gi'aduated
from the Columbia School of Mines
in 1878 and later received a honorary
Ph.D. degree from the University of
Berlin. In addition to holding the
position of geologist for the Northern
Pacific, he was United States Geo
logical Surveyor from 1884 to 1916.
In 1919 he directed the Latin-Amer
ican division of the Col. E. M. House
"Inquiry" for the Peace Conference.
Dr. Willis has done geologic re
search and exploration in Argentina,
Palestine, Cyprus, East Africa, Ja
pan, the Philippines, and India. He
has served as president of American
Geologic Society and of the Seismo
logical Society of America.

Gate, the rise of the Sierra Neva

most persons have in conceiving the
vast extent of geologic time.
The Golden Gate was once only
part of a valley forming the outlet
for the San Joaquin and another
central California river, Dr. Willis
said. San Francisco Bay is similar
to the harbors of Sydney, Australia,
and Rio de Janiero in this respect.
Granite Bubble Helps Stanford
Sixty million years ago the gold
rush, which was the cause of the
settlement of California and the
West, began when a "small" bubble
of molten granite burst from the
earth's interior to form the Sierra
Nevada Mountains. It brought to
the surface the gold that John Mar
shall discovered and Leland Stan
ford profited from. With time, ages
and ages, the high peaks were worn
down to a plateau. But, meanwhile,
volcanic disturbances had sent rivers
of lava pouring down .the mountain
sides leaving permanent traces, and
streams had washed the glittering
metal down into the valley for men
to find. Then the Sierras rose again
to form the present range on top of
which Dr. Willis said traces of the
j old plateau can still be seen.

Squatters Eat Too
Dr. Willis recollected the time
sixty years ago when he, an "inno
cent and ignorant" geology graduate
of the Columbia School of Mines, was
sent to the Northwest to find and
map the coal areas around Puget
Sound, for the Northern Pacific Rail
way. The young man, with several
comrades and five Winchester rifles
acquired the Black Diamond coal
mine for the railroad while the origi
nal "squatters" were out getting food.
"Puget Sound is a unique harbor
in that it was formed by a glacier
which in retreating and melting left
the long, narrow tongues of land de
pression which today are filled with
water," Dr. Willis said. The glacier,
which covered all of North America,
left gravel and stones on the land
and Dr. Willis recalled how he de
tected the various kinds of rock sur
face by the crunching sound of the
wheels of the buggy in which he was
riding. He said that he did not rec
ommend this as an efficient method
of geologic observation.
Emeritus since 1922
Professor Arthur E. Bestor, Jr.,
chairman of the Humanities commit
tee sponsoring the Symposium series,
introduced Dr. Willis, professor of
geology, emeritus, since 1922. Dr.
Willis was the son of W. P. Willis,
a literary man of the early nine
teenth century. He was gi'aduated
from the Columbia School of Mines
in 1878 and later received a honorary
Ph.D. degree from the University of
Berlin. In addition to holding the
position of geologist for the Northern
Pacific, he was United States Geo
logical Surveyor from 1884 to 1916.
In 1919 he directed the Latin-Amer
ican division of the Col. E. M. House
"Inquiry" for the Peace Conference.
Dr. Willis has done geologic re
search and exploration in Argentina,
Palestine, Cyprus, East Africa, Ja
pan, the Philippines, and India. He
has served as president of American
Geologic Society and of the Seismo
logical Society of America.

j old plateau can still be seen.

Squatters Eat Too
Dr. Willis recollected the time
sixty years ago when he, an "inno
cent and ignorant" geology graduate
of the Columbia School of Mines, was
sent to the Northwest to find and
map the coal areas around Puget
Sound, for the Northern Pacific Rail
way. The young man, with several
comrades and five Winchester rifles
acquired the Black Diamond coal
mine for the railroad while the origi
nal "squatters" were out getting food.
"Puget Sound is a unique harbor
in that it was formed by a glacier
which in retreating and melting left
the long, narrow tongues of land de
pression which today are filled with
water," Dr. Willis said. The glacier,
which covered all of North America,
left gravel and stones on the land
and Dr. Willis recalled how he de
tected the various kinds of rock sur
face by the crunching sound of the
wheels of the buggy in which he was
riding. He said that he did not rec
ommend this as an efficient method
of geologic observation.
Emeritus since 1922
Professor Arthur E. Bestor, Jr.,
chairman of the Humanities commit
tee sponsoring the Symposium series,
introduced Dr. Willis, professor of
geology, emeritus, since 1922. Dr.
Willis was the son of W. P. Willis,
a literary man of the early nine
teenth century. He was gi'aduated
from the Columbia School of Mines
in 1878 and later received a honorary
Ph.D. degree from the University of
Berlin. In addition to holding the
position of geologist for the Northern
Pacific, he was United States Geo
logical Surveyor from 1884 to 1916.
In 1919 he directed the Latin-Amer
ican division of the Col. E. M. House
"Inquiry" for the Peace Conference.
Dr. Willis has done geologic re
search and exploration in Argentina,
Palestine, Cyprus, East Africa, Ja
pan, the Philippines, and India. He
has served as president of American
Geologic Society and of the Seismo
logical Society of America.
