# Lifeguard Frank de Lisle Describes Spring Quarter 'Daze' at Boathouse
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
Spring quarter has rolled around
again for another year, and with it
come longer, warmer days, tennis
shoes, dark glasses, spring fever,
and a general inclination to reduce
to a minimum our indoor hours.
Absolutely of no help to a conscien
tious student body is the temptation
to "spend a few minutes" at the
boathouse; with the serious intent
of just looking around, 01* worse
yet, of studying.
So far the Life Guards haven't
yet seen anyone able to concentrate
intently on a school book for more

than 15 seconds at a time. It sat
isfies the conscience, however, to at
least count this as potential study
ing time.
Getting Tan Popular
Aecording to Frank De Lisle, vet
eran life guard of two seasons, and
most experienced guard at the boat
house, the major sport as far as
the lake is concerned is tanning. The
prospective subject, a girl in this
case, in training for a tan, applies
a healthy amount of a variety of
different oils and greases, some of
a very dubious mixture, but even
going as far as salad oil and in one
case, Crisco. Zinc ointment is used
on the nose for protection, and then
the subject is set.
While the sun is gradually chang
ing the skin from a rather pale
white to a pinkish hue, and from
there to a clay-colored effect, and

finally to a dark color of the Ne- !
groid type, the subject utilizes a |
supply of magazines and novels, 1
portable radios, and lastly, the de
voted absorption of bridge, which is
constantly played.
Few Go Swimming
De Lisle estimates that perhaps
only 2 per cent of the students who
come to the boathouse actually ever
go in the water. The water is pret
ty cold, and De Lisle himself ad
vises swimmers to keap their mouths
firmly shut, lest "small marine or
ganisms on the Paramecium order
get strained through the dentures." j
The boathouse is definitely a so
cial spot as well as holding the
slight attraction of . the lake, but
canoeing is supposedly lots of fun, !
and when evenings grow longer, j
maybe in a couple of weeks, the i
boathouse will be open from 7 to 9.
Gives Past History
| De Lisle elaborated a little on the j
past history of the boathouse, in
cluding that day of the old boat- ,
house when the floats collapsed dur
ing a spring carnival. Funds were 1
solicited, however, and the present
boathouse was built in 1938. Som
ber notes to the boathouse past are
the drownings that occur, but there
is no danger if the rules are fol
lowed; no swimming beyond the j
rafts, no carelessness in canoes, etc., j
and if the student is always con
scious of the potential dangers, ev
erything will be all right.
The lifeguards, including Frank j
DeLisle, A 1 Marquez, and Milt Levy, j
share their watches, so that a guard
is constantly on duty, the duty usu
ally including two-afternoons a week.
These boys sleep upstairs in the
boathouse where they have com
fortable rooms and an opportunity
for quiet study at night.
Hours Listed
They go on duty during week days
from 1 to 6, and 10 to G on week
ends. Altogether, lifeguarding is a
good job; the guards are hired
through the A.S.S.U. and paid by the
University. The opportunity for
study is pretty good, a tan is as
sured, and also an excellent chance
to swim and canoe.
