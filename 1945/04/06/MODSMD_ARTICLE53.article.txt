# Rael Lecture Opens Series
## 
### 
Colored slides and commentary by
Profesor Juan B. Rael served to il
lustrate "Mexican Landscape and
Architecture" at last night's His
panic World series.
Monterrey, Mexico, locale for the
first slide, is a city with a population
of 180,000, most of whom siesta be
tween one and four in the afternoon,
said Rael. The city is one of the
most important, industrially, in Mex
ico.
Slides showed the cathedral of
Monterrey, construction of which
was begun in 1630 and completed in
1800.
The Bishop's palace, another of
Monterrey's architectural achieve
ments, was constructed to provide
employment for Indians during a
great depression in the 18th cen
tury. The palace was soon aban
doned when it was discovered to be
too far from the cathedral.
The dominant scenes in the pic
tures of Mexico City and other of
the Mexican cities were of the rows
of houses with red-tiled roofs and
patios.
One of the main architectural dif
ficulties in some Mexican regions is
the sinkng of many of the buildings
after they are built. According to
Dr. Rael, one of the newer buildings
in Mexico City was left unfinished so
that contractors could determine the
amount of sinkage in a specific pe
riod of lime.
