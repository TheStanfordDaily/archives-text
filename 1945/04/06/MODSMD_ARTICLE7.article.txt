the program will be surrounded
by the Cubbcrly sextette—Bar
bara Porter, Chris Flack, Peggy
Hoover, Nancy Belcher, Florence
Mead, and B. J. Wallace—singing
popular arrangements.
Bea Bowman of Branner will also
sing, but her specialty is imitations
—of Danny Kayc, Bing Crosby, and
Frank Sinatra, in some of their most
popular selections.
Delighted with their applause at
the Pow-wow, Chappies' Dick Dris
coll and Bob Brecr are back to try
again, with several original skits on
their program for tonight.
Before the committee members
close down the entertainment and
turn on the records for dancing,
Driscoll will lead the throng in com
munity Kinging.
Miss Banning explained that this
dance will be open to the entire cam
pus, to give both new and old stu
dents an opportunity to get acquaint
ed. It will be no-date and completely
informal.
The tour around campus for all
new students and for those stu
dents new last quarter who missed
the tour, will be lead by Cardinals'
Ed Luce and Ric Supple. Spots of
interest will be pointed out from
the top of the War Libc; students
wishing to go on the trek over
campus are asked to be in front of
the library promptly at 1:30.
The pre-reg program, limited in its
activities because of the relatively
small number of new students, was
planned by Miss Banning and her
committee, Hilda Hicks, Sally Sutch,
Willie Davies, and Jack Siemer.


ED LUCE, who will conduct the
tour of campus at 1:30 p.m. today.
