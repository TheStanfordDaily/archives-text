# Book Explains New Teaching
## 
### 
Dr. John P. Leonard, associate
professor of the School of Education,
recently completed work on a new
book called "The Development of
the Secondary School Curriculum."
In his book, Dr. Leonard discusses
the changes in American high school
curriculum in the past and its rela
tionship to changes in American so
ciety. An analysis is given of the
present educational system and its
problems.
A plan of work-experience is pre
sented by Dr. Leonard for secondary
schools, which will prepare students
more thoroughly for future life. Stu
dents under this plan would be re
quired to take courses in four dif
ferent areas of subjects.
The first area would train the stu
dents for participation in democracy.
This would include government,
family, and economic subjects. The
second area would be education and
training in health and physical fit
ness. The third area would include
| training in vocations for those who
cxpect to get jobs immediately after
leaving secondary school, and train
ing for those who cxpect to go on to
college. The fourth area would be
for individual interests. Hobbies and
all types of interesting courses would
be offered to the students in this
ci rea.
"In spite of their defects," Dr.
Leonard said, "the schools today arc
doing a magnificent job, as is shown
by our present war effort."
