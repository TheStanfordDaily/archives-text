# Fire to Warm Food, Wet Lagunitans At Barbecue Pit
## 
### 
Problems of all Lagunita women
falling in the Lake at this afternoon's
canoe races will be solved when the
crew of hashers arrives at the bar
becue pit to provide warmth and
dryness to victims while they pre
pare the food. As at last quarter's
Lagunita barbecue, a fire will roar
in the pit to keep piping hot the
beans and hot dogs which will be
served. Perhaps the fire will serve
double duty today.
Under Barbara Brookes' direction
the canoe races will begin promptly
at 5, when waterfront, professionals
and amateurs will try their luck in
the match for Lagunita champion
ship. Two women will form a team
for each canoe.
Chairmen of the barbecue are
Charlotte Anderson, Leilani Brink
and Marion Schwaneflugcl of Casa
Ventura. The barbecue will begin
promptly at 5:30, and women are in
vited to get in the spirit of the occa
