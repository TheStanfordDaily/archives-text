A book exhibit in honor of the late
Melville Jacoby, war correspondent
and former Stanford student, is now
being shown at the main library. Mr.
Jacoby served as Far East corre
spondent for Time and Life maga
zines until he was killed in April,
1942.
He was born in Los Angeles in
1916 and as news editor of the high
school paper he revealed unusual
talents in news reporting. While at
Stanford he became a member of the
Daily staff. Because of his interest
in the Far East he obtained an ex
change scholarship to Lingnan Uni
versity in Canton, China.
Stanford Graduate
In 1937 he graduated magna cum
laude from Stanford and then re
turned to China to take a position in
the Chinese government. He became
a coi'respondent for Time and Life
magazines in 1941 and was married
the following October in Manila.
With the outbreak of the war with
Japan, Mr. Jacoby stayed on to re
port the Japanese invasion of the
Philippines and the fall of Manila.
He and his wife then escaped to
Corregidor and stayed there during
most of the siege of the island for
tress.
Escape from Corregidor
John Hersey in his book "Men on
Bataan" says of Mr. Jacoby: "On
Bataan, Jacoby was fast, observant
and eloquent. He did not bother
much with isolated actions, but con
fined himself to general subjects
which told, not how things were go
ing, but what life was like on the
little peninsula."
Before Corregidor fell to the Japa
nese, Mr. Jacoby and his wife and
several others escaped in a boat ti

misfortune finally overtook him.

Melville Jacoby, General George
of the United States Air Force, Alli
son Ind, another correspondent, and
a few others were waiting on a
Northern Australian air field to
board a plane, when a fighter plane
crashed into them. Allison Ind, who
lived to tell the story, describes that
terrible moment in his book "Bataan,
the Judgment Seat" as follows: "But
as I went, my horror-filled eyes
caught two individual flashes of the
scene and forever they were to be
printed on my memory. The first
was the spinning air screw of the
fighter spinning clean from its shaft
and blurring into the form of Mel
Jacoby as he lunged in one fruitless
step to escape. It cut into him in a
ripping, almost vertical diagonal. . . .
The ambulance lurched into motion
and shot off. Then paused as we
came upon Mel Jacoby. But there
was no use stopping there. One
glance told that he was beyond the
help of human hands."
Jacoby Praised
General Mac Arthur said about Mr.
Jacoby that "He could well have
served as a model for war corre
spondents at the front."
In honor of Melville Jacoby and
his interest in the Far East, Stanford
every year offers a prize for the best
essay on some phase of the Far East.

Escape from Corregidor
John Hersey in his book "Men on

Bataan, Jacoby was fast, observant
and eloquent. He did not bother
much with isolated actions, but con
fined himself to general subjects

Melville Jacoby, General George
of the United States Air Force, Alli
son Ind, another correspondent, and
a few others were waiting on a
Northern Australian air field to
board a plane, when a fighter plane
crashed into them. Allison Ind, who
lived to tell the story, describes that
terrible moment in his book "Bataan,
the Judgment Seat" as follows: "But
as I went, my horror-filled eyes
caught two individual flashes of the
scene and forever they were to be
printed on my memory. The first
was the spinning air screw of the
fighter spinning clean from its shaft
and blurring into the form of Mel
Jacoby as he lunged in one fruitless
step to escape. It cut into him in a
ripping, almost vertical diagonal. . . .
The ambulance lurched into motion
and shot off. Then paused as we
came upon Mel Jacoby. But there
was no use stopping there. One
glance told that he was beyond the
help of human hands."

General Mac Arthur said about Mr.
Jacoby that "He could well have
served as a model for war corre
spondents at the front."
