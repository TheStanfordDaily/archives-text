### PEGGY FITTS 
;ere Pete:
This is a fan letter. And I'm not the type of girl
tiat clips pictures of the Calvert ads (anyway,

they look married); I never asked Errol for his
picture (costs a quarter, y'know); Sinatra leaves
me cold (it can't be the bow tie, on Dr. Popper
it looks good). But the time has come. I take my
Underwood in hand and what should come out
but a genuine, from-the-heart fan letter, with
hand-gnawed edges. (Good trick).
Got a pack?
You might say it's a general characteristic of
the local lights not t<p have much to say for
Monday morning. Life on the Fahm is just one
long week-end and Sunday night, being just a
step from Monday morning, never closes in
without stirring up a nasty sensation of Gawd
not-again. But as we shuffle Cellarward for the
Caffeine Hour, no matter how solidly the April
sunshine is pouring down and forming little
puddles in the foyer, it's sure to be bright inside
if you (Pete) are there with the cheery query that
never wearies. "Got a penny-" is the word, and
when we haven't (what are they, anyhow?),
there is all kinds of heartiness in the smile with
which you slip us that autographed 1.0. U. (suit
able for framing).
Got a smoke?
It's hard to find the words for it (Chesterfield,
Lucky Strike, Domino?) but you know what I
mean, don't you, Pete- Men may come and
men may go (and boy, do they!) but Pete goes
on forever. We girls know the real thing when
we see it, bow tie or no bow tie. So this is a fan
letter to our favorite man of 1945â€”Pete of the
Cellar, Pete the pin-up.
Got a match?
