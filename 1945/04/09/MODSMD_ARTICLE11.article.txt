The OWI doesn't seem to want "wild speculation" on
the present Russian policy towards Japan, but it cer
tainly is not that to say that the Japanese can look at
the denunciation of the non-aggression pact between
them in three lights.
First of all, Russia might think that, with the German
war practically over, her neutrality in the Pacific is
worth more, and is trying to get it. Second, Russia
might be getting ready for war; or third, Russia might
think that her ties with the third Axis partner are a
handicap to her, and wants to break them, and nothing
more.
JAP DIPLOMACY
The Japanese would logically operate on the first as
sumption until the Soviet showed that it was wrong.
They reacted along those lines instantly when Mos
cow's announcement was made.
The Kioso cabinet resigned, and a new one came in
headed by Admiral Sizuki. Sizuki, a Genero, repre
sented the left end of the Japanese right wing, and
thus was a person that both the militarists and Stalin
might be able to trust.
If any proof that he is to be a front for the militarists
is needed, it comes from the number of objectionable
officers holding portfolios under him, one by the name
of Tojo.
NEXT MOVE
But so far the attempted rapprochement doesn't seem
to be making progress. If Japanese diplomacy continues
to fail, the army will have to move in preparation for
war.
The Japanese frontier in Manchuria is tactically very
strong, being covered by the Amur river and high
mountains in back of that. The Maritime Provinces,
however, are a wedge in its flank, and Soviet planes and
submarines based at Vladivostok could efficiently
blockade the Sea of Japan, cutting off Japanese ship
ping to Korea.
I However these provinces are Very narrow, and might
become a pocket if the Japanese, by a rapid offensive,
could cut across them.
The big Japanese worry, however, is the Gobi Desert,
If the Russians moved across it to Peking, they would
not only cut off the garrisons in Manchuria and Ko
rea, but put themselves on a natural invasion highway
to Shanghai.
But such a move would bring with it immense supply
problems. Russia would have to move gasoline, ammu
nition and water from railheads at Irkur down through
the mountains to Urga, and then over throe hundred
miles of desert, no easy task. The Japanese might also
try to strike first in the Gobi Desert, before the Russian
staff preparation was complete, and push the Red army
up to Urga, in order to bottle it up in the hills. But
an often reported lack of Japanese mechanized equip
ment, and the poor quality of the stuff which we have
seen so far, might make this plan visionary.
At any rate, if there is a Russo-Jap war, it will
probably not come until Germany is completely sub
jugated, since our "whole army and the whole Russian
army will then be able to operate against China and
launch one all-out effort, instead of a group of limited
>nes. That is. unless Japan decides to attack Russia
first.
