# Gypsies To Roam At 'Y' Friday 13th
## 
### 
Escape 59 book reports and 33 prc
mid-term quizzes at least once a
week. Otherwise you'll turn into a
gopher. The latter comment comes
directly from a scientific report.
This Friday night the YWCA is
giving an excellent excuse for es
cape. Under a motto of "Roam with
the Gypsies—or—for heaven's sakes,
come see us Friday night," they are
advocating 100 per cent attendance
at their three-floor Women's Club
house su pur-special "Gypsy Night."
You'll hear plaintive, romany mu
sic from the balcony above as you
walk in the pennant-covered caravan
and are grabbed at once by a gypsy
woman who'll run you rapidly
through a gauntlet of entertainment,
games, and dancing. All this and re
freshments too.
Then you'll have an opportunity of
bowing three times before the king
of the evening—a faculty member
who'll be chosen by lot.
To have s or not to have dates is
purely optional, and fun is promised
to those who arrive stag.
