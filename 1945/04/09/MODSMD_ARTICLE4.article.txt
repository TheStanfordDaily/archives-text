# More Student Opinion On Excom Proposal
## 
### 
i Of course the purpose of the new
I plan for representation is to make j
the Executive Committee a body
I which really represents the stu
dents. Under the present system
this is impossible to assure. For ex- |
ample, the Executive Committee to- 1
j day is composed of two men who live
: "off campus," and five out of six of
| the women live on the Row.
Since the living group is the most
j important source of student opinion,
I believe that this plan is far better
j than the present system. If accepted,
| I feel the students will have a
j stronger voice and more interest in
t their activities.
