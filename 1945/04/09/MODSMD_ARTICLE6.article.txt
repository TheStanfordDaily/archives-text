# Students To Vote on Area Representation
## 
### 
No system of student government
is without its shortcomings', and
many of these shortcomings do not
become evident until a system has
been tried.
The present governmental set-up
has been found inadequate when one
wants to ascertain student opinion.
The new plan at least creates the
machinery which can, if properly
used, make government leaders feel
the pressure of student opinion. But
will it be used? For, if the students,
as well as the leaders, do not make
use of their privileges, we might as
well stick with our present system
which calls for less expensive and
less complicated elections than the
lew one.
We must at least give ourselves the
opportunity for a workable organiza
tion. Therefore, I will vote in favor
of the new proposal.

The proposed scheme of represen
tation by living groups will be a lot
more difficult to handle, mechanical
ly; but the representation ' will be
much better. Classes are not, really,
social groups; they are too large and
there are not enough common in
terests among the members.
Living groups, while not perfect as
a basis of representation, are a great
improvement; and the chances of
knowing your ExCom man or woman
personally are immeasureably im
oroved. I believe, therefore, that au
thority should be given to try the
new scheme.

Head of Men's Council.
, Harvard s professor of government,
Carl Friedrichs, once said that "The
problem of government is to turn
sentiment i»<(> action." During the
last two years at Stanford, student
leaders have had difficulty in doing
that, because they often have had
little knowledge of student senti
ment. The fault was not theirs, how
ever; it lay, rather, within a system
(hat separated them from the tangi
ble, potent groups within the student
body—the living groups themselves.
During these war years, class ac
tivities have ,been relegated to a
minor position. We eat as living
groups, we do volunteer war work
as living groups, we give parties as
living groups. Should we not also
act politically as living groups, rath
er than as defunct classes?
For these reasons I can extend full
support to the reorganization plan
whereby the Executive Committee
will be elected by voters voting as
living groups within definite areas
(as political district). It is our best
bet for turning student "sentiment
into action.
—J. D. WILLIAMS.
Chairman Election Board.

Referendum to the student voters will be held tomorrow to
determine whether or not the present method of representation
on Executive Committee should be replaced by a system of
voting and representation by living-group areas.
Endorsed by the Executive Committee in an unanimous vote
of approval, the proposal attempts to repair an inadequacy in
the present system which sets up representation by class, when
class lines have become so nearly obliterated by the wartime
quarter system, and when through experience it has been noted
that the logical units of cohesion, interest and spirit are the living
group areas.
The referendum will inquire whether or not the individual
favors the following general method of representation:
Proposed: that elective members of Executive Committee
with the exception of the president, vice-president and graduate
members, be elected directly by, and shall represent, areas of
living groups. Voters to vote only for the representative or rep
resentatives from their area.
"This proposal would abolish the present system of election
at large and representation by classes. The change would not
effect other student body officers."
Representation by living group area, it is felt, would give the
student a better opportunity to know for whom he is voting, to
whom he should go with requests and suggestions, and from
whom he can obtain information concerning the problems before
Excom. From the living groups, and discussion within them,
spring the comprehensive blocs of student opinion—the opinion
which is necessary to intelligent and representative legislation.
The officers elected under the new plan would be in continu
ous contact with the persons whom they represent. Their re
sponsibility to the students would be effective because they
would report to the house presidents in their area at weekly
meetings. At these meetings, the Excom member would re
veal the issues that are then facing Excom, and may be sure
that the issues will be carried in turn to the students of the area
through Monday night house meetings.
Student opinion of each issue could be returned to the Excom
member unofficially through his own observations or question
ing of the members within his group, or officially from the vot
ing or opinions obtained by the house presidents.
Regardless of where they live, students would then have a
representative who sees and would be concerned with the prob
lems peculiar to their group. The danger that one part of campus
have all the members of Excom living within it would be com
pletely eliminated.
The graduate member on Excom would be elected at large
from the student body as a whole; in addition, students living
off-campus, whether graduate or undergraduate, would be
counted as a living-group area, with representation.
The present ex-officio membership of Women's Conference
president and the president of Men's Inter-hall Council does not
provide for a direct flow of student opinion to Excom for two
reasons. No vote is given these officers at Excom meetings, and
machinery for exchange of student opinion ih highly indirect,
and limited by the brevity of the Conference meetings.

Following is the proposal for
changing the representation on Ex
ecutive Committee. The draft of the
article for the constitution with the
approval of Excom has been drawn
up by the Committee on Constitu
tional Revision under William Gil
bert. Instead of having the complete
article submitted at this time, it will
be submitted for approval as a part
of the constitution later in the quar
ter.
For the past two years Executive
Committee has been operating under
emergency wartime powers, for by
a student vote the constitution was
laid aside and was to be followed in
spirit if not in letter. Thus, this pro
posal is extended to the vote of the
students not in its constitutional
form but merely as a referendum to
obtain the endorsement of the mem
bers of the Associated Students for
the fundamental change which Ex
ecutive Committee proposes to carry
out under its emergency powers.
For a long time, a need has been
felt for more complete representa
tion on Excom. The students
whom each Excom member repre
sents as a class are too difficult to
reach, scattered as they are in ev
ery living group.
Executive Committee has a dual
function—it is both policy-forming
and legislative. For formulating pol
icy, perhaps the present set-up is
adequate. But in legislating, Excom
needs student opinion and must vote
as representatives. There our pres
ent set-up is inadequate. With this
change Excom will be better able to
carry out both its functions.
It is true that each class may not
be represented but that is again the
purpose of the plan—to do away with
the class as a system of representa
tion which has decreased in effec
tiveness and potency over the years.
The living group is the most power
ful factor in a resident university
such as Stanford.
Under this plan, each area will
have its representatives. Thus stu
dent opinion will be more easily ac
cessible and the decisions of Excom
may be more easily and readily an
nounced to the students with less
danger of misinterpretation.
In addition, absolutely every
area on campus will be represent
ed. There is no possibility of hav
ing only one portion of the campus
with full control depending on the
turn ol the election or the nomina
tions. Besides, students may be
come closer to the Executive Com
mittee on realizing: the closeness of
their representatives, how that
person whom they as a smaller
unit have elected is responsible to
them.
The policy of the present admin
istration has been not to "tide over"
the war years but to use the oppor-
tunity to build and lay the founda
i tions for a more effective and
I workable student government.

The proposed scheme of represen
tation by living groups will be a lot
more difficult to handle, mechanical

much better. Classes are not, really,
social groups; they are too large and
there are not enough common in
terests among the members.
Living groups, while not perfect as
a basis of representation, are a great
improvement; and the chances of
knowing your ExCom man or woman

, Harvard s professor of government,

problem of government is to turn
sentiment i»<(> action." During the
last two years at Stanford, student
leaders have had difficulty in doing
that, because they often have had
little knowledge of student senti
ment. The fault was not theirs, how
ever; it lay, rather, within a system
(hat separated them from the tangi
ble, potent groups within the student
body—the living groups themselves.
During these war years, class ac
tivities have ,been relegated to a
minor position. We eat as living
groups, we do volunteer war work
as living groups, we give parties as
living groups. Should we not also
act politically as living groups, rath
er than as defunct classes?
For these reasons I can extend full
support to the reorganization plan
whereby the Executive Committee
will be elected by voters voting as
living groups within definite areas
(as political district). It is our best
bet for turning student "sentiment
into action.
—J. D. WILLIAMS.
Chairman Election Board.

Referendum to the student voters will be held tomorrow to
determine whether or not the present method of representation
on Executive Committee should be replaced by a system of
voting and representation by living-group areas.
Endorsed by the Executive Committee in an unanimous vote
of approval, the proposal attempts to repair an inadequacy in
the present system which sets up representation by class, when
class lines have become so nearly obliterated by the wartime
quarter system, and when through experience it has been noted
that the logical units of cohesion, interest and spirit are the living
group areas.
The referendum will inquire whether or not the individual
favors the following general method of representation:
Proposed: that elective members of Executive Committee
with the exception of the president, vice-president and graduate
members, be elected directly by, and shall represent, areas of
living groups. Voters to vote only for the representative or rep
resentatives from their area.
"This proposal would abolish the present system of election
at large and representation by classes. The change would not
effect other student body officers."
Representation by living group area, it is felt, would give the
student a better opportunity to know for whom he is voting, to
whom he should go with requests and suggestions, and from
whom he can obtain information concerning the problems before
Excom. From the living groups, and discussion within them,
spring the comprehensive blocs of student opinion—the opinion
which is necessary to intelligent and representative legislation.
The officers elected under the new plan would be in continu
ous contact with the persons whom they represent. Their re
sponsibility to the students would be effective because they
would report to the house presidents in their area at weekly
meetings. At these meetings, the Excom member would re
veal the issues that are then facing Excom, and may be sure
that the issues will be carried in turn to the students of the area
through Monday night house meetings.
Student opinion of each issue could be returned to the Excom
member unofficially through his own observations or question
ing of the members within his group, or officially from the vot
ing or opinions obtained by the house presidents.
Regardless of where they live, students would then have a
representative who sees and would be concerned with the prob
lems peculiar to their group. The danger that one part of campus
have all the members of Excom living within it would be com
pletely eliminated.
The graduate member on Excom would be elected at large
from the student body as a whole; in addition, students living
off-campus, whether graduate or undergraduate, would be
counted as a living-group area, with representation.
The present ex-officio membership of Women's Conference
president and the president of Men's Inter-hall Council does not
provide for a direct flow of student opinion to Excom for two
reasons. No vote is given these officers at Excom meetings, and
machinery for exchange of student opinion ih highly indirect,
and limited by the brevity of the Conference meetings.

Following is the proposal for
changing the representation on Ex
ecutive Committee. The draft of the
article for the constitution with the
approval of Excom has been drawn
up by the Committee on Constitu
tional Revision under William Gil
bert. Instead of having the complete
article submitted at this time, it will
be submitted for approval as a part
of the constitution later in the quar
ter.
For the past two years Executive
Committee has been operating under
emergency wartime powers, for by
a student vote the constitution was
laid aside and was to be followed in
spirit if not in letter. Thus, this pro
posal is extended to the vote of the
students not in its constitutional
form but merely as a referendum to
obtain the endorsement of the mem
bers of the Associated Students for
the fundamental change which Ex
ecutive Committee proposes to carry
out under its emergency powers.
For a long time, a need has been
felt for more complete representa
tion on Excom. The students
whom each Excom member repre
sents as a class are too difficult to
reach, scattered as they are in ev
ery living group.
Executive Committee has a dual
function—it is both policy-forming
and legislative. For formulating pol
icy, perhaps the present set-up is
adequate. But in legislating, Excom
needs student opinion and must vote
as representatives. There our pres
ent set-up is inadequate. With this
change Excom will be better able to
carry out both its functions.
It is true that each class may not
be represented but that is again the
purpose of the plan—to do away with
the class as a system of representa
tion which has decreased in effec
tiveness and potency over the years.
The living group is the most power
ful factor in a resident university
such as Stanford.
Under this plan, each area will
have its representatives. Thus stu
dent opinion will be more easily ac
cessible and the decisions of Excom
may be more easily and readily an
nounced to the students with less
danger of misinterpretation.
In addition, absolutely every
area on campus will be represent
ed. There is no possibility of hav
ing only one portion of the campus
with full control depending on the
turn ol the election or the nomina
tions. Besides, students may be
come closer to the Executive Com
mittee on realizing: the closeness of
their representatives, how that
person whom they as a smaller
unit have elected is responsible to
them.
The policy of the present admin
istration has been not to "tide over"
the war years but to use the oppor-
tunity to build and lay the founda
i tions for a more effective and
I workable student government.

much better. Classes are not, really,
social groups; they are too large and
there are not enough common in

Living groups, while not perfect as
a basis of representation, are a great
improvement; and the chances of

, Harvard s professor of government,

last two years at Stanford, student
leaders have had difficulty in doing
that, because they often have had
little knowledge of student senti
ment. The fault was not theirs, how
ever; it lay, rather, within a system
(hat separated them from the tangi
ble, potent groups within the student
body—the living groups themselves.
During these war years, class ac
tivities have ,been relegated to a
minor position. We eat as living
groups, we do volunteer war work
as living groups, we give parties as
living groups. Should we not also
act politically as living groups, rath
er than as defunct classes?
For these reasons I can extend full
support to the reorganization plan
whereby the Executive Committee
will be elected by voters voting as
living groups within definite areas
(as political district). It is our best
bet for turning student "sentiment
into action.
—J. D. WILLIAMS.
Chairman Election Board.

Referendum to the student voters will be held tomorrow to
determine whether or not the present method of representation
on Executive Committee should be replaced by a system of
voting and representation by living-group areas.
Endorsed by the Executive Committee in an unanimous vote
of approval, the proposal attempts to repair an inadequacy in
the present system which sets up representation by class, when
class lines have become so nearly obliterated by the wartime
quarter system, and when through experience it has been noted
that the logical units of cohesion, interest and spirit are the living
group areas.
The referendum will inquire whether or not the individual
favors the following general method of representation:
Proposed: that elective members of Executive Committee
with the exception of the president, vice-president and graduate
members, be elected directly by, and shall represent, areas of
living groups. Voters to vote only for the representative or rep
resentatives from their area.
"This proposal would abolish the present system of election
at large and representation by classes. The change would not
effect other student body officers."
Representation by living group area, it is felt, would give the
student a better opportunity to know for whom he is voting, to
whom he should go with requests and suggestions, and from
whom he can obtain information concerning the problems before
Excom. From the living groups, and discussion within them,
spring the comprehensive blocs of student opinion—the opinion
which is necessary to intelligent and representative legislation.
The officers elected under the new plan would be in continu
ous contact with the persons whom they represent. Their re
sponsibility to the students would be effective because they
would report to the house presidents in their area at weekly
meetings. At these meetings, the Excom member would re
veal the issues that are then facing Excom, and may be sure
that the issues will be carried in turn to the students of the area
through Monday night house meetings.
Student opinion of each issue could be returned to the Excom
member unofficially through his own observations or question
ing of the members within his group, or officially from the vot
ing or opinions obtained by the house presidents.
Regardless of where they live, students would then have a
representative who sees and would be concerned with the prob
lems peculiar to their group. The danger that one part of campus
have all the members of Excom living within it would be com
pletely eliminated.
The graduate member on Excom would be elected at large
from the student body as a whole; in addition, students living
off-campus, whether graduate or undergraduate, would be
counted as a living-group area, with representation.
The present ex-officio membership of Women's Conference
president and the president of Men's Inter-hall Council does not
provide for a direct flow of student opinion to Excom for two
reasons. No vote is given these officers at Excom meetings, and
machinery for exchange of student opinion ih highly indirect,
and limited by the brevity of the Conference meetings.

Following is the proposal for
changing the representation on Ex
ecutive Committee. The draft of the
article for the constitution with the
approval of Excom has been drawn
up by the Committee on Constitu
tional Revision under William Gil
bert. Instead of having the complete
article submitted at this time, it will
be submitted for approval as a part
of the constitution later in the quar
ter.
For the past two years Executive
Committee has been operating under
emergency wartime powers, for by
a student vote the constitution was
laid aside and was to be followed in
spirit if not in letter. Thus, this pro
posal is extended to the vote of the
students not in its constitutional
form but merely as a referendum to
obtain the endorsement of the mem
bers of the Associated Students for
the fundamental change which Ex
ecutive Committee proposes to carry
out under its emergency powers.
For a long time, a need has been
felt for more complete representa
tion on Excom. The students
whom each Excom member repre
sents as a class are too difficult to
reach, scattered as they are in ev
ery living group.
Executive Committee has a dual
function—it is both policy-forming
and legislative. For formulating pol
icy, perhaps the present set-up is
adequate. But in legislating, Excom
needs student opinion and must vote
as representatives. There our pres
ent set-up is inadequate. With this
change Excom will be better able to
carry out both its functions.
It is true that each class may not
be represented but that is again the
purpose of the plan—to do away with
the class as a system of representa
tion which has decreased in effec
tiveness and potency over the years.
The living group is the most power
ful factor in a resident university
such as Stanford.
Under this plan, each area will
have its representatives. Thus stu
dent opinion will be more easily ac
cessible and the decisions of Excom
may be more easily and readily an
nounced to the students with less
danger of misinterpretation.
In addition, absolutely every
area on campus will be represent
ed. There is no possibility of hav
ing only one portion of the campus
with full control depending on the
turn ol the election or the nomina
tions. Besides, students may be
come closer to the Executive Com
mittee on realizing: the closeness of
their representatives, how that
person whom they as a smaller
unit have elected is responsible to
them.
The policy of the present admin
istration has been not to "tide over"
the war years but to use the oppor-
tunity to build and lay the founda
i tions for a more effective and
I workable student government.

No system of student government
is without its shortcomings', and
many of these shortcomings do not

The present governmental set-up
has been found inadequate when one
wants to ascertain student opinion.
The new plan at least creates the
machinery which can, if properly
used, make government leaders feel
the pressure of student opinion. But
will it be used? For, if the students,
as well as the leaders, do not make
use of their privileges, we might as
well stick with our present system
which calls for less expensive and
less complicated elections than the
lew one.
We must at least give ourselves the

Carl Friedrichs, once said that "The
problem of government is to turn

last two years at Stanford, student
leaders have had difficulty in doing
that, because they often have had
little knowledge of student senti
ment. The fault was not theirs, how
ever; it lay, rather, within a system
(hat separated them from the tangi
ble, potent groups within the student
body—the living groups themselves.
During these war years, class ac
tivities have ,been relegated to a
minor position. We eat as living
groups, we do volunteer war work
as living groups, we give parties as
living groups. Should we not also
act politically as living groups, rath

For these reasons I can extend full
support to the reorganization plan
whereby the Executive Committee
will be elected by voters voting as
living groups within definite areas

into action.
—J. D. WILLIAMS.
Chairman Election Board.

Referendum to the student voters will be held tomorrow to
determine whether or not the present method of representation
on Executive Committee should be replaced by a system of
voting and representation by living-group areas.
Endorsed by the Executive Committee in an unanimous vote
of approval, the proposal attempts to repair an inadequacy in
the present system which sets up representation by class, when
class lines have become so nearly obliterated by the wartime
quarter system, and when through experience it has been noted
that the logical units of cohesion, interest and spirit are the living
group areas.
The referendum will inquire whether or not the individual
favors the following general method of representation:
Proposed: that elective members of Executive Committee
with the exception of the president, vice-president and graduate
members, be elected directly by, and shall represent, areas of
living groups. Voters to vote only for the representative or rep
resentatives from their area.
"This proposal would abolish the present system of election
at large and representation by classes. The change would not
effect other student body officers."
Representation by living group area, it is felt, would give the
student a better opportunity to know for whom he is voting, to
whom he should go with requests and suggestions, and from
whom he can obtain information concerning the problems before
Excom. From the living groups, and discussion within them,
spring the comprehensive blocs of student opinion—the opinion
which is necessary to intelligent and representative legislation.
The officers elected under the new plan would be in continu
ous contact with the persons whom they represent. Their re
sponsibility to the students would be effective because they
would report to the house presidents in their area at weekly
meetings. At these meetings, the Excom member would re
veal the issues that are then facing Excom, and may be sure
that the issues will be carried in turn to the students of the area
through Monday night house meetings.
Student opinion of each issue could be returned to the Excom
member unofficially through his own observations or question
ing of the members within his group, or officially from the vot
ing or opinions obtained by the house presidents.
Regardless of where they live, students would then have a
representative who sees and would be concerned with the prob
lems peculiar to their group. The danger that one part of campus
have all the members of Excom living within it would be com
pletely eliminated.
The graduate member on Excom would be elected at large
from the student body as a whole; in addition, students living
off-campus, whether graduate or undergraduate, would be
counted as a living-group area, with representation.
The present ex-officio membership of Women's Conference
president and the president of Men's Inter-hall Council does not
provide for a direct flow of student opinion to Excom for two
reasons. No vote is given these officers at Excom meetings, and
machinery for exchange of student opinion ih highly indirect,
and limited by the brevity of the Conference meetings.

Following is the proposal for
changing the representation on Ex
ecutive Committee. The draft of the
article for the constitution with the
approval of Excom has been drawn
up by the Committee on Constitu
tional Revision under William Gil
bert. Instead of having the complete
article submitted at this time, it will
be submitted for approval as a part
of the constitution later in the quar
ter.
For the past two years Executive
Committee has been operating under
emergency wartime powers, for by
a student vote the constitution was
laid aside and was to be followed in
spirit if not in letter. Thus, this pro
posal is extended to the vote of the
students not in its constitutional
form but merely as a referendum to
obtain the endorsement of the mem
bers of the Associated Students for
the fundamental change which Ex
ecutive Committee proposes to carry
out under its emergency powers.
For a long time, a need has been
felt for more complete representa
tion on Excom. The students
whom each Excom member repre
sents as a class are too difficult to
reach, scattered as they are in ev
ery living group.
Executive Committee has a dual
function—it is both policy-forming
and legislative. For formulating pol
icy, perhaps the present set-up is
adequate. But in legislating, Excom
needs student opinion and must vote
as representatives. There our pres
ent set-up is inadequate. With this
change Excom will be better able to
carry out both its functions.
It is true that each class may not
be represented but that is again the
purpose of the plan—to do away with
the class as a system of representa
tion which has decreased in effec
tiveness and potency over the years.
The living group is the most power
ful factor in a resident university
such as Stanford.
Under this plan, each area will
have its representatives. Thus stu
dent opinion will be more easily ac
cessible and the decisions of Excom
may be more easily and readily an
nounced to the students with less
danger of misinterpretation.
In addition, absolutely every
area on campus will be represent
ed. There is no possibility of hav
ing only one portion of the campus
with full control depending on the
turn ol the election or the nomina
tions. Besides, students may be
come closer to the Executive Com
mittee on realizing: the closeness of
their representatives, how that
person whom they as a smaller
unit have elected is responsible to
them.

No system of student government
is without its shortcomings', and
many of these shortcomings do not
become evident until a system has
been tried.
The present governmental set-up
has been found inadequate when one
wants to ascertain student opinion.
The new plan at least creates the
machinery which can, if properly
used, make government leaders feel
the pressure of student opinion. But
will it be used? For, if the students,
as well as the leaders, do not make
use of their privileges, we might as
well stick with our present system
which calls for less expensive and
less complicated elections than the
lew one.
We must at least give ourselves the
opportunity for a workable organiza
tion. Therefore, I will vote in favor
of the new proposal.
