## WOMEN'S COUNCIL 
### 
When you shave away the usual gripes and
bullwash that spring from any sort of discipline,
you can come down to a few specific sugges
tions that could be acted upon in today's meet
ing of Women's Council representatives.
What we would like to see most would be
uniformity of all women's residences in the ju
diciary phases of regulation. A whisper of
"dirty pool" creeps up when one student spends
two locked-in nights for the same offense as that
of a student in another residence who received
only a Friday night lock-in. The establishment of
uniformity must be accomplished by Council
representatives, not Council itself, for they are
the only persons who can bring the smallest de
tail of penalty-giving and line-drawing on social
conduct into a consistent all-campus pattern.
Right into the lap of each Council member
falls the solving of many arbitrary questions
that arise daily.
"May I take two floaters as an exception this
week?"
"How about that lockout . . . wish I could
change it to next Saturday."
"Is it all right to take a 2 o'clock in San Jose?"
She has to exercise her judgment on these and
like problems a dozen times a week. We sug
gest that Council members check over their ver
dicts on the most common of these eventuali
ties and make certain that their arbitrary power
is channeled into similar opinions.
To the rest of us, Stanford women who had
a tough time passing the social regulations test
and whose minds are fuzzy on some aspects of
the rules, there is a way to cooperate with a
hard-working Council and its representatives.
We can wise up on our established social codes
in a few spare minutes and we can accept Coun
cil's decisions in good faith that they are work
ing for fairness and efficiency in Stanford's ju
iiciary branch of student government. N. S.
