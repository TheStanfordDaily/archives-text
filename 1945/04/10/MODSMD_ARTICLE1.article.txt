'tackefellcr Grants
Grants have been made by
the Rockefeller Foundation to
assist in the development of
the Stanford program and to
provide for visiting lecturers
and, after the war, for study
by the faculty in the Far East.
The program is designed to
give the student a broad, over
all understanding of the geog
raphy, peoples, history, poli
tics, and religion of the Pa
cific-Asiatic-Russian regions,
in addition to a more intimate
acquaintance and language fa
cility with a specific country
or area.
Chinese, Malayan, Russian,
and Japanese languages will
be offered and China, Japan,-
Russia, Southeast Asia, and the
Pacific Islands will be stressed
in different courses as separate
areas.

Foundation lor Positions
Collaboration with other schools
and departments at Stanford will
provide a foundation for further
training that will lead to commercial
and public service positions in the
Orient. The studies will also consti
tute of themselves a liberal education
for other than professional persons.
As soon as possible, an advanced
program of graduate classes and
seminars will be developed.
Strategic Locality

Â£ shores of the Pacific," Dr. Tres
idder pointed out, "is in a favored
position to serve as a center for the
study of the peoples, languages, and
cultures of the Far East and Rus
sia.
Dr. Anthony Sokol, associate pro
fessor of languages, is associate di
rector of the new Far Eastern pro
gram headed by Director Dodds.
