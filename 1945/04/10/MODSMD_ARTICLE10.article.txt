# Vote Today, 9 to 12. in Excom Election Method Referendum
## 
### 
.Opportunity to express opinion on
the issue concerning Excom repre
sentation will be extended to all stu
dents from 9 to 12 this morning when
the newly formed Election Board
sets up its voting booths on the His
tory and Engineering corners. Upon
presentation of student body cards,
each student, regardless of class
standing, will be allowed to state
whether or not he favors the follow
ing general method of representa
tion:

''Proposed: that elective members
of the Executive Committee with the
exception of the president, vice
president, and graduate member be
elected directly by, and shall repre
sent, areas of living groups. Voters
are to vote only for the representa
tive or representatives of their area.
"This proposal would abolish the
present system of election at large
by classes. The change would not
affect other student body offices."
Women chosen by Election Board
member Janet Ossman to staff the
polls are Annette Kirkman, Jo Glas
son, Merle Beuttel, Barbara Ber
nard, Alice Gurley, and Ann Carter.
Results will be announced in to
morrow's Daily.
Because this is an issue which
arisen out of the need of a govern
ment created by and responsible to
the students, every eligible person
is urged to vote.
