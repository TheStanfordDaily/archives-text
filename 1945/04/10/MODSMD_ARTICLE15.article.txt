# SECOND CHANCE

Americans are worrying too much about the success of the
United Nations Conference, states Dr. Wesley Frost, former am
bassador to Paraguay and a veteran of thirty-five years in our
State Department. He declares that voting and other mechanisms
of a world organization are really minor points, for the big thing
is that the nations of the world are meeting together.
This is essentially true. Certainly the League of Nations
failed to prevent World War II but nevertheless it was a bold and
important experiment, failing only because the nations of the
world did not commit themselves far enough as participants in
an international organization.
Nations have nearly always been motivated by self-interest,
and although they joined into a body of nations, they remained
in will and spirit separate entities. Hence the League of Nations,
when put to the test, failed, as every nation acted in its own self
interest regardless of the eventual consequences to itself and to
other nations.
But human progress is made only through experiment and
failure. The League failed, and a war ensued in which nearly
every nation of the world has suffered profoundly. But every
people of the world now has some concept of the price of self
interest. Everywhere people want security against another world
conflict, which might herald the end of civilization and human
existence.
Nations of the world, nevertheless, are still selfish and the
problems of a world organization are still legion; however, the
price of failure is too evident, and this price no rational nation
will be willing to pay.
The world has learned from its experiences and will do better
in the new world organization, because every nation must know
that the best way to serve its own interests is to consider, as
equally important, the other nations. Participants in the new
world organization must be more sincere; for they must be aware
that the success of the organization is a necessity.
So the minor problems that the organization will face are not
really so vital in the face of the new spirit of world co-operation
which now must motivate ever nation. In this sense the United
States Conference has in a measure already succeeded.â€”Ted
