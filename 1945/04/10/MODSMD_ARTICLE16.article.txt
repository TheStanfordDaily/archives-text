# Seen from an Ivory Tower
## 
### 
The common sense of our socifety has imposed greater restrictions on the
public behavior of women than of men. Few would be so contrary as to
maintain that the same ideals of conduct should apply equally to bolh
sexes. But what cannot be supported by philosophy is, nevertheless, often
practiced; and what is often practiced becomes reinforced by habit. The ;
resulting neglect of standards has far-reaching consequences.
My business of late frequently leads me from the top of my Ivory Tower
to the Library. On one such excursion I was disturbed by peals of raucous
laughter from a girl seated on the Library steps. This surprising breach
of manners forced my attention to the subject of conduct in general and
that of girls in particular. Too many examples are now multiplied in my
experience to permit the thought that my introduction to the topic was
an isolated instance.
There are many in this republican country who resent being asked
to conform to any ideal of conduct, whose belief in equality is so strong
that they will admit of no greater degree of excellence in one than in an
other. It is, nevertheless, this fault in particular against which Americans
have most carefully to guard, as it is shaped so closely to our innate
temperaments.
Lacking a native aristocracy, we escape the degredation that results in
the subservient class, but we also miss the presence of accepted models of
good conduct.
By conduct I mean more than mere formal etiquette; conduct is a frame
of mind, derived from a freedom from mean purposes, balance and serenity
of disposition and a sense of the obligations imposed by the possession of
privileges.
All this we have to establish for ourselves, not only for our personal im- j
provement, but also if we have any hopes of our influence abroad being ,
effective for good.
That class of society which the nation relies upon to provide its .
leadership is represented at this University in its educahle stage. Its
future abilities and qualities are being formed here each day.
If Stanford girls behave like hoydens, if Stanford men are complaisant
ibout such behavior, we lose more than the pleasure of living among polite ,
ind well-bred associates; we stand to lose the respect that we should de
serve and the influence that we should exercise upon the nation.
