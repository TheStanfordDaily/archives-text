# WAR FRONTS
## Weser Line Falls Under Allied Push 
### 
PARIS, Tuesday, April 1.0 (UP).â€”
Four Allied armies paced by a blis
tering 5000-plane attack drove to
ward the Elbe River approaches to
Berlin last night as a badly sliced-up
enemy fell back through scores of
burning German towns. The Ger
man Weser River defense line was
smashed completely.
In the north the Canadians closed
a trap on between 50,000 and 150,000
Germans in Holland and the British
battled in the outskirts of Bremen
and threatened Hamburg on the Elbe
54 miles on the northeast.
