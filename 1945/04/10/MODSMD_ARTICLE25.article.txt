# Council Resumes Songbook Planning
## 
### 
Plans for the Stanford songbook,
the first project of Stanford's Music
Council organized last quarter, were
under way again yesterday al the
first council meeting of the quarter,
after a long delay due to copyright
difficulties.
According to Bob Miller, chairman,
most of the Stanford songs, includ
ing such old standbys as "Come Join
the Band" and"The Cardinal Is
Waving," are copyrighted by the
Thornton W. Allen Publishing Com
pany of New York.
In order to publish the songbook

which the Music Council had in j
mind, said Miller, it would have been I
j necessary to buy the copyrights of
nearly all Stanford songs from the
Allen Company, thereby making the
j cost of publishing the book prohibi
j iive.
The Music Council is now asking j
for student reaction to a plan by
which Allen agrees to publish a
Stanford songbbOk of from 15 to 25
I songs at a price reasonable to Stan- j
I ford students, provided Stanford can j
| guarantee the sale of at least 1,000 j
' copies. The songbook now under 1

consideration would include the
words and music to 15 songs.
