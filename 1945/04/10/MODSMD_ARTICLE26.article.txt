# Realism and Acting Make 'The Tree' Plain, but Good
## 
### 
"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" is a
good example of what Hollywod can
turn out without the aid of Bacall,
Lamarr, and company. It's a good
plain story put over by the right

kind of cast—Bet
' ty Smith's account
of the Brooklyn
of several decades
ago, completely
unglamorized.
It's the type of
picture that could
get away with
having noth ing
more torrid than

Officer McShean's (Lloyd Nolan)
proposal to Katie (Dorothy Mc-
Guire), where he asks her if she
"would care to keep company" with
him as a wife. There was little more
spice than Aunt Sissy (Joan Blon
dell), who went around collecting
husbands named "Bill."
Picture Realistic
Yet the picture clicked. Perhaps
the realism and characterizations did

it. Young Peggy Ann Garner turned
in a wonderful performance as plain,
red-nosed Francie. She was all the
better for her miserabfy straight
hair and half-starved look.
James Dunn came out of hiberna
tion long enough to turn in a star
portrayal of drunken Johnny Nolan.
Dunn, who was inevitably the "dad
dy" in Shirley Temple's pre-coming
of age days, has added little during
his retirement except the hint of a
new chin. He was the "daddy" again
in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn," but
instead of marrying Shirley Temple's
teacher, he died of acute alcoholism.
Feeble Symbol
Probably the only truly weak point
was an oration delivered on free
education by the grandmother, who
I think was supposed to be symbolic
of Brooklyn's melting pot. Through
out the entire movie, she sat in the
background like a grinning mass of
dough—except for one time, when
she cleared her throat, everyone
looked on attentively, and she forced
out painfully memorized European
dialect of some sort.
For full appreciation, don't sit in
the balcony. The movie's packed
with pitiful scenes, but even the
sight of Dorothy McGuire scrubbing
tenement staircases is no competi
tion for the balcony hecklers, pic
nickers, and genei'al entertainers.—
