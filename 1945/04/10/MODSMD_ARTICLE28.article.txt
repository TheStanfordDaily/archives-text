For years Santa Clara has been
considered one of the top athletic
schools in the nation. In all sports
they have compiled outstanding rec
ords and have been the nemesis for
many a Stanford team. In 1940, fur
instance, the closest game the "Wow"
boys had was against the Broncos,
the Stanford team won that one on a
7-6 margin. Now we read where
Santa Clara intends to resume inter
collegiate athletics next winter. Now
this news in itself is significant, but
what is even more significant is the
fact that Santa Clara boasts a stu
dent body of only 125 students.
And here we sit at Stanford, with
over 800 men just waiting to get
back to sports, and with twice as
many women ready to cheer them
on. And when everyone asks us
what the matter is, why Stanford
doesn't put out teams, we have no
answer to give them.
Surely we can't say that Stanford
is afraid to put out teams, because
that isn't the truth. There is enough
material around to build up squads
that would do well against any team
on the coast. We can't say that the
students don't want sports, because
that isn't true either. Finally, we
can't say that the enrollment isn't
large enough, especially now when
schools much smaller than Stanford
have been fielding teams. In other
words, we can't answer their ques
tions because we ourselves don't
know why Stanford is not partici
pating in inter-collegiate sports.
Of course, the administration might
feel that Stanford is still not in a
position to put out a football team.
That might be very true, but foot
ball is only one sport in a group of
many. We have already mentioned
the talent on campus for track. In
the last few years USC has gone
back East with skeleton track squads
and has won the national track
championships. We're not saying
that Stanford could do this (although
the idea is not too far-fetched, what
with men like Luce, Hiller and Levy)
but we are saying that the team
could ably represent the University.
And in tennis we find the same
story. In the men-under-18 division
are two stand-outs, Doug Tuck and
Eugene Corman. Tuck took second
in the San Francisco championship
just last week, and Corman, who
hails from Los Angeles (oops, Bev
erly Hills) is considered to be one of
the top players in the Bay Area. And
in the men's division we find John
Brock, the youngest of a family of
tennis stars. A few years back Brock
went to Vermont and placed high in
both singles and doubles in that
State's championship tussle.
We find, then, that it is not the ex
ception but the rule. We have men
who are able to participate in ath
letics; we have men who want to
participate in athletics. They are all
looking for one answer: why doesn't
Stanford resume inter-collegiate
athletics, at least in some of the
sports?
We don't know the answer. We
hope somebody does.
