them a ride to town.

although the police force is working
on the case. Mr. Davis urges girls to
be careful about accepting rides and
about walking alone at night.

"It's your personal security that's
important," he told the girls. "We
need your co-operation and descrip
tions."
If the police are needed sometime
when no one answers in the Stan
ford office, students may call 3131,
the Palo Alto Police Department, and
the person on duty will transmit the
message to a nearby patrol car.

Davis Speaks
Gordy Davis, Chief of Police,
spoke to the girls on "How We Can
Better Protect Ourselves and Our
Fellow Students." Four girls in the
past two months have been accosted
by a strange man who offers to give
them a ride to town.
The man has not yet been arrested
although the police force is working
on the case. Mr. Davis urges girls to
be careful about accepting rides and
about walking alone at night.

"It's your personal security that's
important," he told the girls. "We
need your co-operation and descrip
tions."
If the police are needed sometime
when no one answers in the Stan
ford office, students may call 3131,
the Palo Alto Police Department, and
the person on duty will transmit the
message to a nearby patrol car.

Davis Speaks
Gordy Davis, Chief of Police,
spoke to the girls on "How We Can
Better Protect Ourselves and Our
Fellow Students." Four girls in the
past two months have been accosted
by a strange man who offers to give
them a ride to town.
The man has not yet been arrested
although the police force is working
on the case. Mr. Davis urges girls to
be careful about accepting rides and
about walking alone at night.

"It's your personal security that's
important," he told the girls. "We
need your co-operation and descrip
tions."
If the police are needed sometime
when no one answers in the Stan
ford office, students may call 3131,
the Palo Alto Police Department, and
the person on duty will transmit the
message to a nearby patrol car.
