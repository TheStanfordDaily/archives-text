# Spring Show Tryouts Begin Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tryouts for the annual Spring
Show will be held tomorrow and
Thursday nights from 7:30 to 10, an
nounced Corky Wollman, director.
For its first 1945 production, Ram's
Head has chosen Charles A. Tay
lor's famous melodrama, "From Rags
to Riches." Following the precedent
set down by the Spring Show of 1943,
olio acts will also be included in
the program.
This week's tryouts will only be
for acting parts in the melodrama
itself and will be held in the Little
Theater. Tryouts for the olio acts
will be held next week at which
time ideas, songs, specialties, and
novelty acts may be submitted.
"From Rags to Riches" was picked
by Ram's Head for the Spring Show,
as not enough original plays were
turned into the playwriting contest
held last quarter to enable them to
make a selection. The show will be
presented in the Little Theater of
Memorial Hall on May 10, 11, and 12.
Chosen to direct the produition
was Corky Wollman, who is also
president of Ram's Head, Stanford
honorary dramatic society. Assisting
her will be Peggy Fitts as associate
director; Mary Lou Patton as assist
ant director; Lynn Shrader, technical
director; Mickey Garms, assistant
technical director; Dick Williams,
lights; Pat Jones, costumes, with
Janice Swan and Candy Taylor as
sisting; and Elaine Skahan and
Lome Freeman, props.
Crews will be badly needed for
the show, and anyone interested in
working on lights, in making cos
tumes, in finding and handling props,
or in helping with make-up, is re
quested to come to the Little Thea
ter either Wednesday or Thursday
nights between 7:30 and 10 p.m. and
