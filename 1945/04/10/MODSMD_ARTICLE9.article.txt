(An Editorial)
. . . an affirmative vote today to change the Excom representation
to one based on living group areas.
This means that student government in the fall will have a
sound advantage in promoting student activities according tc
student interests.
With five of its six women members coming from the Row.
and its two men from "off-campus," the present Excom has found
itself greatly handicapped in sensing and knowing student opin
ion.
The proposed change will provide for a representative from
each distinct campus unit so that everyone will feel represented.
Further provisions will see to it that Excom members will meet
with house officers to provide a direct channel of student opinion.
The vote today will authorize the Executive Committee to
work out a complete plan along these lines to be incorporated in
the A.S.S.U. constitution, which will be voted on later in the quar
ter.
In practice, it will amount to an Excom of approximately the
same size with a representative each from LAGUNITA,-THE
UNION UNIT, THE ROW, THE FRESHMAN WOMEN'S HALLS,
THE FRESHMAN MEN'S HALLS, MEN'S HALLS, ENCINA, OFF
CAMPUS STUDENTS, and A GRADUATE MEMBER, plus a presi
dent and a vice-president elected as before.
For the election this quarter, a general non-area member will
be elected for those people who will live on campus next fall
b.ut who will not know where they will live until after the election.
In the future it is hoped that plans will be worked out so that
they will know before the elections.
This plan is readily adaptable to the post-war Stanford as the
prescribed number and gender of representatives are automati
cally convertible with the use of the halls.
We believe that this plan, which works hand in hand with the
proposed housing plan, will provide a sound and sensible basis
for Stanford's future student activities; we recommend a "Yes"
vote today.
