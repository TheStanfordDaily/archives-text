tured the former Japanese naval base at Unten Bay Tu day, while at the
southwestern tip of the Philippines American troops landed on Jolo Island
and gained complete control of the Sulu Archipelago. The occupation of

ican line threatening Borneo. Gen
eral Douglas Mac Arthur announced
the capture of Jolo City and its air
dromes in the first thrust. The Pa

miral Chester W. Nimitz announced

have been counted since Sunday.
Only 222 prisoners have been taken,
but 43,378 civilians are now under
the care of the U.S. military govern
ment.

were held to a standstill as the ar
tillery duel went on. Massed Army
and Marine artillery, carrier planes,
and the guns of battleships, cruiscrs
and destroyers raked enemy posi
tions protecting Naha and three
southern airfields. The Japanese
made several unsuccessful counter
attacks under cover of their own
barrage.

ance.
