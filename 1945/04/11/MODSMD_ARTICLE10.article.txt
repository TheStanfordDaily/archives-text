# Red Army lakes Most of Vienna

LONDON, Wednesday, April 11 !
(UP). â€”The Red Army won 85 per
cent of Vienna yesterday, clearing
all but three of the Austrian capi
tal's districts, and hurled a German
garrison across the Danube canal
into a closing pocket, Moscow an
nounced last night.
Tightening the trap, the Second
Ukrainian Army north of the river
swept through the Napoleonic battle
field of Deutschwagran and nar
rowed to 10 miles the supply or es
cape gap severing the last 15 square
miles of German-held Vienna.
While Vienna, the most important
bastion in any German scheme for
a last-ditch stand in the south, be
came virtually a Soviet prize only
four days after being entered, Mos
cow announced that the German
disaster at Koenigsberg had cost
the enemy 134,000 men captured or
killed.
This brought German losses in the
East Prussian campaign to 234,000 by
actual Soviet count and probably
close to 300,000.
