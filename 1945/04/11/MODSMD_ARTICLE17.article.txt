# New Council's Power To Surpass League's
## 
### TED DRENTON 
President Roosevelt gave the .name
"United Nations" to the Allies of this
war. This name was also suggested
at Dumbarton Oaks for the new
world organization to be drafted in
San Francisco. This organization will
comprise all "peace-loving nations''
of the world and will have a consti
tution which will allow the world
executive body far more power than
the League of Nations' executive
body ever possessed.
The general assembly will not be
a "debating society," as the old
League was called, but will have
specific jobs and specific ways of do
ing them. Members of the assembly
will air the opinions or grievances of
their particular countries. If a na
tion is threatened by an aggressive
neighbor the matter may be dis
cussed in the assembly; and then, if I
two-thirds of the members agree, |
the matter may be referred to the
security council for action.
Working Together
The assembly will determine with
the security council admission of
new members and suspension of un
co-operative nations. On the ma
jority of questions voting in the as
sembly will be by simple majority
roll call, but more important ques
tions will be decided by a two-thirds
plurality.
The assembly will initiate studies
or make recommendations for inter- j
national co-operation on issues of j
world significance. The group, under !
proposals made by America, Russia. I
England, and China at the Dumbar- j
ton Oaks conference, will meet once J
a year; however, detailed work will I
be carried out on a day to day basis j
by the security, economic, and so- J
cial councils. The assembly may j
meet oftener if it should feel such
a meeting justified, and members I

may establish the group's own rules
of conduct, electing a different pre
siding officer for each session.
Secretariat
The assembly will select the sec
retariat, whose members would be

international citizens, selected on the
basis of ability rather than on any
national numerical allocation. Head
of this secretariat will be a secre
tary-general, selected also by the
assembly. This officer may be com

pared to a city manager who has au
thority to act as an administrator
without waiting for the voters' ap
proval of his individual acts. He may
bring before the assembly any mat
ter threatening world peace.

President Roosevelt gave the .name
"United Nations" to the Allies of this
war. This name was also suggested
at Dumbarton Oaks for the new
world organization to be drafted in
San Francisco. This organization will
comprise all "peace-loving nations''
of the world and will have a consti
tution which will allow the world
executive body far more power than
the League of Nations' executive
body ever possessed.
The general assembly will not be
a "debating society," as the old
League was called, but will have
specific jobs and specific ways of do
ing them. Members of the assembly
will air the opinions or grievances of
their particular countries. If a na
tion is threatened by an aggressive
neighbor the matter may be dis
cussed in the assembly; and then, if I
two-thirds of the members agree, |
the matter may be referred to the
security council for action.
Working Together
The assembly will determine with
the security council admission of
new members and suspension of un
co-operative nations. On the ma
jority of questions voting in the as
sembly will be by simple majority
roll call, but more important ques
tions will be decided by a two-thirds
plurality.
The assembly will initiate studies
or make recommendations for inter- j
national co-operation on issues of j
world significance. The group, under !
proposals made by America, Russia. I
England, and China at the Dumbar- j
ton Oaks conference, will meet once J
a year; however, detailed work will I
be carried out on a day to day basis j
by the security, economic, and so- J
cial councils. The assembly may j
meet oftener if it should feel such
a meeting justified, and members I

may establish the group's own rules
of conduct, electing a different pre
siding officer for each session.
Secretariat
The assembly will select the sec
retariat, whose members would be

international citizens, selected on the
basis of ability rather than on any
national numerical allocation. Head
of this secretariat will be a secre
tary-general, selected also by the
assembly. This officer may be com

pared to a city manager who has au
thority to act as an administrator
without waiting for the voters' ap
proval of his individual acts. He may
bring before the assembly any mat
ter threatening world peace.
