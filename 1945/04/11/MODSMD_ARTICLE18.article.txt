# Spring Elections Run on New Basis
## 
### 
A vote of 309 lo 27 in yesterday's referendum
endorsed the proposed change in Excom repre
sentation from a class to a living-group area
basis, Election Board announced last night. This
plan will go into effect in the spring guarter elec
tions to be held tentatively on April 25 .
The proposal was introduced to Excom when
the committee itself and interested students
branded the present machinery inadeguate for
guaranteeing suitable and effective representa
tion of the student body as a whole and of the
natural units and social interests within it.
The principal changes which this new sys
tem will bring about are the election by voters
in specified living-group areas of one of their
residents to represent them, and the meeting
each week of the elected Excom member with
the house presidents in his area for an inter
change of information on pertinent issues and
prevailing group opinion.

Representatives on Excom will now repre
sent Lagunita, the Union Unit, the Row, the
freshman women s halls, the freshman men's
halls, Encina, off-campus students and the
graduate students. A non-area member will be
elected this quarter by those people who will
live on campus next fall but who will not at
the time of the election know in what area they
will live. This, it is hoped, will be a temporary
measure.
Whereas representation along class lines
might formerly have guaranteed efficient rep
resentation, the breakdown of comprehensive
class units because of the quarter system
seemed a serious defect in the present repre
sentation method on the committee.
Referendum votes were counted by the new
ly appointed Election Board: Ruth Lewis, Janet
Ossman, Jerry Matin, and Frank Schiff.
