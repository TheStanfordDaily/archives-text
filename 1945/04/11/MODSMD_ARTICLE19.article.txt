# Con Home Reflects Spirit of Farm Founders
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Bike-riders wheel past the tomb of
the Stanfords, where lie the "par
ents of the children of California,"
past the dull-green shapes that grow
as the famous cactus gardens, out
onto the rutted country road, layered
with sunshine, that runs past the
Stock Farm.
They direct their bicycles, slow
with the dips in the road and with
the riders' pleasure at their sur
roundings, toward a group of build
ings at a crotch in the road, and they
are thinking about Stanford — the
spirit of the founders, the jokes about
the cactus gardens, the placidity of
the Farm.
"The Con Home"
Perhaps in no other part of (he
■ University and its surroundings is
expressed so well the essential spirit
of Stanford and its founders than in
the group of buildings clustered here
at the end of the road, and called
from its cumbersome title, Stanford
Convalescent Home, "the Con
Home." For nearly 26 years the Con
Home has been a part of Stanford's
pride and its activities, and though
supported in large part by the Com
munity Chest and by volunteer
groups in the district, has been
known as "Stanford's own charity."
Founded by Students
In 1917, under the leadership of
I Dr. D. Charles Gardner, a summer
home for children was founded on
campus by interested students. For
two years the organization*flourished
under their enthusiastic care, and in
1919 was converted into a home for
convalescents. With the sanction of
the University Board of Trustees, the
Home in 1920 was established on the
site of the Stanfords' home.
Housing 60 children, the Home
consists of two units for bed patients,
and one auxiliary unit for the "run
abouts." For those children who arc
well enough to make use of them,
there are a clubhouse for the boys;
a tree-house for the girls; a doll
house, furnished in miniature; and

i in the shady play yard, swings, slides
and a sand box.
Well Cared For
Here, under the care of Mrs. At
; wood, the superintendent; Sam Mc-
Donald, the gardener; three nurses,
a staff of ward helpers, and the in
| terest of residents in the community,
i are children suffering from malnu
! trion, recovering from stays in hos
-1 pitals, or preparing to undergo op
erations that require good health and
j strength.
Stanford students have always had
an interest in the Home. At Christ
mas toys are sent from campus liv
ing groups; at Easter, the Chi Ome
< gas traditionally hide eggs for the
children to find; and during spring
I quarter — beginning Api-il 30 this
year—students conduct a week-long
| drive to raise funds for support of

the Home. One of the days of the
drive is devoted to Labor Day; stu
dents swarm out to the Home, paint
toys, repair equipment, and work in
the outlying vegetable gardens.
Root for Farm
Children at the Home, "Stanford
rooters who have never seen the
Quad," have become acquainted with
the students through their many
charities, look forward to seeing
them come each year at Labor Day
time.
Bke-riders, wheeling past, remark
that they are proud of the Home;
that it wouldn't be bad, being sick
in a place like that; and that when
the Con Home Drive begins, they'll
be anxious to take part in its many
activities not solely for their own
pleasure, but for the little children,
chattering there in the sunshine.

Bike-riders wheel past the tomb of

the cactus gardens, the placidity of
the Farm.
"The Con Home"
Perhaps in no other part of (he
■ University and its surroundings is
expressed so well the essential spirit
of Stanford and its founders than in
the group of buildings clustered here
at the end of the road, and called
from its cumbersome title, Stanford
Convalescent Home, "the Con
Home." For nearly 26 years the Con
Home has been a part of Stanford's
pride and its activities, and though
supported in large part by the Com
munity Chest and by volunteer
groups in the district, has been
known as "Stanford's own charity."
Founded by Students
In 1917, under the leadership of
I Dr. D. Charles Gardner, a summer
home for children was founded on
campus by interested students. For
two years the organization*flourished
under their enthusiastic care, and in
1919 was converted into a home for
convalescents. With the sanction of
the University Board of Trustees, the
Home in 1920 was established on the
site of the Stanfords' home.
Housing 60 children, the Home
consists of two units for bed patients,
and one auxiliary unit for the "run
abouts." For those children who arc
well enough to make use of them,
there are a clubhouse for the boys;
a tree-house for the girls; a doll
house, furnished in miniature; and

i in the shady play yard, swings, slides
and a sand box.
Well Cared For
Here, under the care of Mrs. At
; wood, the superintendent; Sam Mc-
Donald, the gardener; three nurses,
a staff of ward helpers, and the in
| terest of residents in the community,
i are children suffering from malnu
! trion, recovering from stays in hos
-1 pitals, or preparing to undergo op
erations that require good health and
j strength.
Stanford students have always had
an interest in the Home. At Christ
mas toys are sent from campus liv
ing groups; at Easter, the Chi Ome
< gas traditionally hide eggs for the
children to find; and during spring
I quarter — beginning Api-il 30 this
year—students conduct a week-long
| drive to raise funds for support of

the Home. One of the days of the
drive is devoted to Labor Day; stu
dents swarm out to the Home, paint
toys, repair equipment, and work in
the outlying vegetable gardens.
Root for Farm
Children at the Home, "Stanford
rooters who have never seen the
Quad," have become acquainted with
the students through their many
charities, look forward to seeing
them come each year at Labor Day
time.
