PARIS, Wednesday, April 11 (UP).
—The American Eighth Army cap
tured Hannover yesterday and
spurted to the front in a race to
Berlin as its armored columns went
beyond Brunswick along a super- |
highway, only 103 miles from the I
Reich capital at last reports.
The U.S. First Army, ripping ofl
a 40-mile gain, also approached the
last 100 miles beyond Berlin, re
ported by Allied fliers to be a dead
city and perhaps even abandoned.
As multiple Allied spearheads
raced on along Adolf Hitler's mod
ern network of highways to Berlin,
Supreme Allied Headquarters in a
message authorized by General
Dwight D. Eisenhower told Germans
in the north that "German resistance
in the west has collapsed" and
warned that "Allied armies are now
threatening your towns."
"In these last weeks of the war
the future of your town is in the
gravest danger'from the fanatics who
may make a last-minute attempt to
make the ports unusable," the mes
sage said.
