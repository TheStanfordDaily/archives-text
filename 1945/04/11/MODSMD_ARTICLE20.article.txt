# Racial Superiority Not True, Says Cole; Tolerance Needed
## 
### 
"If there is mental superiority of
: one race, anthropological and other
scientific investigations have certain
ly not discovered it," avowed Dr.
Fay-Cooper Cole in his Tuesday
Evening Series lecture, "Science and
the Doctrine of Inferior Races," last
! night in Memorial Hall.
Dr. Cole, who is chairman of the |
Department of Anthropology at the
; University of Chicago and has been
| a student of races and race history
for more than 35 years, said that the
reason for the wide prevalence of
I racial intolerance today lies in the
almost universal misuse and misun
! derstanding of the word "race."
Need to Understand What Race Is
"We need to have a definite under
; standing of what race is," he de
clared, "for on the basis of this term
, we pass discriminatory laws against
I 'races' which are based on misunder
j standing." As an example, he cited J
! the naturalization laws of the United
States which allow only white and
i negro immigrants to become Ameri-
I can citizens. Many peoples of the j
Middle East and other areas are de- j
nied citizenship on the ground that
they belong to neither of these !
"racial" groupings, said Dr. Cole,
whereas Iranians, Persians, and
many other nationalities are mem
bers of tire great Caucasoid racial di
[ vision which also includes the so
j called "white" race.
Disproves 'Race' Theories
In statements which struck a di- |
rect blow at racial intolerance in ;
the United tSates, Dr. Cole declared
j that the negro is "no more inferior j
! than any other race," offering scien
j tific proof to back his contention; j
: and, he addnd, "there is no such 1
thing as a 'Jewish race'." The early j
Jews were predominantly members
of the Mediterranean race, a subdi
j vision of the Caucasoid group; when
they spread out, they mixed with the 1
Armenoid-Alpine races. "European
Jews are mainly of Alpine racial
stock, having been converted to the
Jewish religion when the Mediter
ranean Jews migrated to the mid-
Russian Empire of the Kazars. Sixty
per cent of American Jews arc de
scendants of these people. In addi
tion there arc Nordic and some Chi
nese Jews."
Dr. Cole defined the term "race"
as "a people who have in common
i with each other certain physical
characteristics which they pass on
from one generation to the next, and
which differentiate them from the
rest of mankind."
Racial Divisions
On the basis of this definition Dr.
Cole divided mankind into three
ureal racial divisions: Negroid, Cau
casoid, and Mongoloid. Under these
larger divisions, he said, there arc
such sub-groups as the Nordic, Al
pine. Mediterranean, Hindu, and ;
: other races.
"Race is a fact," he said, "and the j
mixing of races does work. The story

that mixture of widely different
races causes sterility in the offspring
is entirely unfounded."
Proofs of Racial Background
"Although the similarity among
races is far greater than the differ
ences." said Dr. Cole, "we magnify
the differences." Science does not
1 depend on color alone to classify an
individual as a member of one race
or another, he added; there are about
30 characteristics on the skeleton,
and about 30 on the living person
that provide racial clues to the sci
entist. "And the skeleton is as great
a clue or greater than the living hu
man when it comes to proving racial
descent," he said.
How do racial differences arise?
Dr. Cole answered his own question
by saying that sports, or mutations,
may appear in an individual who, if
the mutation is a dominant charac
j teristic, will pass it on to his off
spring. If the individual is a mem
j ber pf an isolated racial group where
inbreeding is the rule, that mutation
i will after some time appear in evei'y
member of the group.
Ajj to race in civilization, Dr. Cole
{ said that any race is capable of
| adopting the civilization of another
| race. As an outstanding example of
this he showed how the northern
Europeans, once the most backward
people on their continent, adopted
! the civilization of their southern
j neighbors to become the dominant
group in the world today. The de
j velopment of civilization among ra-
I cial groups depends entirely on so
; cial and environmental factors, he
i said.
"If we are to have a unified, free
America,"he concluded, "we must
become more tolerant. I'm ex
tremely disturbed to see how thin
the veneer of racial tolerance is
in Ibis country. The little slurs,
the jokes with a sting, against
Jews, Italians, Negroes, Poles, and
many others are only small ex
amples of the intolerance prevail
ing in this country today. What
happened in Germany through
education to the superman theory
may just as easily happen here.
"We have made some progress,"
he continued in a hopeful tone;
"I believe there is a growth of tol
erance coining on in spite of all
disheartening things. What is ex
hibited today in racial tolerance
could not have happened 15 years
ago.
"If we're going to have tolerance
and understanding, people like you
and me have got to watch our
tongues and not say the stories
with a sting that hurt the other
fellow. I think tolerance will come.
luit it " ill lie slow, and it will need
all of us."

"If there is mental superiority of
: one race, anthropological and other

Fay-Cooper Cole in his Tuesday
Evening Series lecture, "Science and
the Doctrine of Inferior Races," last
! night in Memorial Hall.
Dr. Cole, who is chairman of the |
Department of Anthropology at the
; University of Chicago and has been
| a student of races and race history
for more than 35 years, said that the
reason for the wide prevalence of
I racial intolerance today lies in the
almost universal misuse and misun
! derstanding of the word "race."
Need to Understand What Race Is
"We need to have a definite under
; standing of what race is," he de
clared, "for on the basis of this term
, we pass discriminatory laws against
I 'races' which are based on misunder
j standing." As an example, he cited J
! the naturalization laws of the United
States which allow only white and
i negro immigrants to become Ameri-
I can citizens. Many peoples of the j
Middle East and other areas are de- j
nied citizenship on the ground that
they belong to neither of these !
"racial" groupings, said Dr. Cole,
whereas Iranians, Persians, and
many other nationalities are mem
bers of tire great Caucasoid racial di
[ vision which also includes the so
j called "white" race.
Disproves 'Race' Theories
In statements which struck a di- |
rect blow at racial intolerance in ;
the United tSates, Dr. Cole declared
j that the negro is "no more inferior j
! than any other race," offering scien
j tific proof to back his contention; j
: and, he addnd, "there is no such 1
thing as a 'Jewish race'." The early j
Jews were predominantly members
of the Mediterranean race, a subdi
j vision of the Caucasoid group; when
they spread out, they mixed with the 1
Armenoid-Alpine races. "European
Jews are mainly of Alpine racial
stock, having been converted to the
Jewish religion when the Mediter
ranean Jews migrated to the mid-
Russian Empire of the Kazars. Sixty
per cent of American Jews arc de
scendants of these people. In addi
tion there arc Nordic and some Chi
nese Jews."
Dr. Cole defined the term "race"
as "a people who have in common
i with each other certain physical
characteristics which they pass on
from one generation to the next, and
which differentiate them from the
rest of mankind."
Racial Divisions
On the basis of this definition Dr.
Cole divided mankind into three
ureal racial divisions: Negroid, Cau
casoid, and Mongoloid. Under these
larger divisions, he said, there arc
such sub-groups as the Nordic, Al
pine. Mediterranean, Hindu, and ;
: other races.
"Race is a fact," he said, "and the j
mixing of races does work. The story

that mixture of widely different
races causes sterility in the offspring
is entirely unfounded."
Proofs of Racial Background
"Although the similarity among
races is far greater than the differ
ences." said Dr. Cole, "we magnify
the differences." Science does not
1 depend on color alone to classify an
individual as a member of one race
or another, he added; there are about
30 characteristics on the skeleton,
and about 30 on the living person
that provide racial clues to the sci
entist. "And the skeleton is as great
a clue or greater than the living hu
man when it comes to proving racial
descent," he said.
How do racial differences arise?
Dr. Cole answered his own question
by saying that sports, or mutations,
may appear in an individual who, if
the mutation is a dominant charac
j teristic, will pass it on to his off
spring. If the individual is a mem
j ber pf an isolated racial group where
inbreeding is the rule, that mutation
i will after some time appear in evei'y
member of the group.
Ajj to race in civilization, Dr. Cole
{ said that any race is capable of
| adopting the civilization of another
| race. As an outstanding example of
this he showed how the northern
Europeans, once the most backward

"Race is a fact," he said, "and the j
mixing of races does work. The story

that mixture of widely different
races causes sterility in the offspring
is entirely unfounded."
Proofs of Racial Background
"Although the similarity among
races is far greater than the differ
ences." said Dr. Cole, "we magnify
the differences." Science does not
1 depend on color alone to classify an
individual as a member of one race
or another, he added; there are about
30 characteristics on the skeleton,
and about 30 on the living person
that provide racial clues to the sci
entist. "And the skeleton is as great
a clue or greater than the living hu
man when it comes to proving racial
descent," he said.
How do racial differences arise?
Dr. Cole answered his own question
by saying that sports, or mutations,
may appear in an individual who, if
the mutation is a dominant charac
j teristic, will pass it on to his off
spring. If the individual is a mem
j ber pf an isolated racial group where
inbreeding is the rule, that mutation
i will after some time appear in evei'y
member of the group.
Ajj to race in civilization, Dr. Cole
{ said that any race is capable of
| adopting the civilization of another
| race. As an outstanding example of
this he showed how the northern
Europeans, once the most backward
people on their continent, adopted
! the civilization of their southern
j neighbors to become the dominant
group in the world today. The de
j velopment of civilization among ra-
I cial groups depends entirely on so
; cial and environmental factors, he
i said.
"If we are to have a unified, free
America,"he concluded, "we must
become more tolerant. I'm ex
tremely disturbed to see how thin
the veneer of racial tolerance is
in Ibis country. The little slurs,
the jokes with a sting, against
Jews, Italians, Negroes, Poles, and
many others are only small ex
amples of the intolerance prevail
ing in this country today. What
happened in Germany through
education to the superman theory
may just as easily happen here.
"We have made some progress,"
he continued in a hopeful tone;
"I believe there is a growth of tol
erance coining on in spite of all
disheartening things. What is ex
hibited today in racial tolerance
could not have happened 15 years

"If there is mental superiority of
: one race, anthropological and other
scientific investigations have certain
ly not discovered it," avowed Dr.
Fay-Cooper Cole in his Tuesday
Evening Series lecture, "Science and
the Doctrine of Inferior Races," last
! night in Memorial Hall.
Dr. Cole, who is chairman of the |
Department of Anthropology at the
; University of Chicago and has been
| a student of races and race history
for more than 35 years, said that the
reason for the wide prevalence of
I racial intolerance today lies in the
almost universal misuse and misun
! derstanding of the word "race."
Need to Understand What Race Is
"We need to have a definite under
; standing of what race is," he de
clared, "for on the basis of this term
, we pass discriminatory laws against
I 'races' which are based on misunder
j standing." As an example, he cited J
! the naturalization laws of the United
States which allow only white and
i negro immigrants to become Ameri-
I can citizens. Many peoples of the j
Middle East and other areas are de- j
nied citizenship on the ground that
they belong to neither of these !
"racial" groupings, said Dr. Cole,
whereas Iranians, Persians, and
many other nationalities are mem
bers of tire great Caucasoid racial di
[ vision which also includes the so
j called "white" race.
Disproves 'Race' Theories
In statements which struck a di- |
rect blow at racial intolerance in ;
the United tSates, Dr. Cole declared
j that the negro is "no more inferior j
! than any other race," offering scien
j tific proof to back his contention; j
: and, he addnd, "there is no such 1
thing as a 'Jewish race'." The early j
Jews were predominantly members
of the Mediterranean race, a subdi
j vision of the Caucasoid group; when
they spread out, they mixed with the 1
Armenoid-Alpine races. "European
Jews are mainly of Alpine racial
stock, having been converted to the
Jewish religion when the Mediter
ranean Jews migrated to the mid-
Russian Empire of the Kazars. Sixty
per cent of American Jews arc de
scendants of these people. In addi
tion there arc Nordic and some Chi
nese Jews."
Dr. Cole defined the term "race"
as "a people who have in common
i with each other certain physical
characteristics which they pass on
from one generation to the next, and
which differentiate them from the
rest of mankind."
Racial Divisions
On the basis of this definition Dr.
Cole divided mankind into three
ureal racial divisions: Negroid, Cau
casoid, and Mongoloid. Under these
larger divisions, he said, there arc
such sub-groups as the Nordic, Al
pine. Mediterranean, Hindu, and ;
: other races.
