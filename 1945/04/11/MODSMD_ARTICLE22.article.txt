# RUSSO-JAPANESE RELATIONS
## 
### 
The announcement of the cancellation by the
USSR of the Russo-Japanese neutrality pact has
considerably more meaning than just the pos
sibility of a combined knockout blow being
prepared for the nerve center of Hirohito's
little realm.
Behind the action lies material for our future
interpretation of both the spirit in which Russia
will regard future action toward Japan, and
the political desirability of acting in concur
rence about measures to preserve peace in the
Pacific for future generations.
It is not popularly heeded in our speculation
about "the great enigma" that the feud between
Russia and the Japanese is historically older and
more battle-scarred than our own mutual ill-will
with the Japanese government. The Russian
push to the east across the huge expanse of
their continent, climaxed in 1776, bears great
similarity to our westward movement. The
Russian people expended great efforts, and the
painful extension of their great Trans-Siberian
railway was an expression of national faith
and courage. At the culmination of their ex
pansion, for many years, they were forced to
play nip and tuck in the remote eastern regions,
afraid of the legendary power of Genghis
Khan's warriors.
For many years now the proximity of the
Japanese, who have imposed their "co-pros
perity sphere" upon the Manchurians at Rus
sia's back door, has made this area the so
called tinderbox of Asia.
Only the Soviet desperate need for peace
after the tortuous birth of their "state of the
proletariat" kept the tinderbox from flaming
previous to this war.
No doubt the Japanese were more acutely
astonished than we were by the emergence of
a new Soviet fighting mechanism that tripped
I filler on his journey toward Moscow.
It seems safe to assume from the record of
Japanese-Russian relations that we can rely
on another power in the east that has similar
interests in keeping the Japanese Empire guite
distant from its own borders.
The Soviets are aware of their position, as is
shown by the dramatic way in which they
broke off relations, just a few weeks ahead of
the anticipated time. Here is another situation
in which only the utmost stupidity would allow
us to trump our partner's ace, or play a dummy
hand.
