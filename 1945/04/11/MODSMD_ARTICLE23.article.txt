# COURTESY FOR THE BLIND
## 
### 
Coming closer to the realities of war than
has been the lot of college women in the past,

Stanford women have found during the past
year that there is much for them to do in the
way of giving entertainment, friendship, and
reassurance to men from Dibble General Hos
pitality.
But a cautioning note comes from Lt. Col.
Norman L. Cutler, chief of the blind service at
the hospital, who was quoted in a recent Palo
Alto Times article as follows:
"It is regrettable that some civilians allow
their natural curiosity to hurt the men (blind
soldiers) as they try to learn their way around
Palo Alto and surrounding communities as part
of their rehabilitation."
It's true that most of us want to be consider
ate and helpful, but we're not sure just how to
begin. The hospital has prepared the follow
ing list of suggestions concerning our cour
tesy to the blind:
1. Don't blurt out questions about how the
blind soldier was hurt. Be tactful and let it
come out in the course of a conversation.
2. Don't let him leave the table with food
on his clothing. Be tactful and tell him about it.
3. Don't go into great detail when helping
him find a seat. Just put his hand on the back
of the chair and he'll do the rest. Don't push
him into the chair.
4. Don't overlook the soldier's proffered hand
when being introduced to him.
5. Don't be stickily sentimental. Treat the
soldier casually or don't talk to him at all.
6. Don't overlook the blind soldier. Ask him
questions directly and not over his head; let
him order a meal if you're dining out.
7. Don't buy a blind soldier something to
eat or drink unless you're willing to have him
buy an occasional round.
8. Don't try to lift him up a stairway. He's
all right physically.
All that these men want or need is our friend
ship and common courtesy. Without an ex
cess or lack of tact, we can aid them to feel at
home in their social contacts. They're just plain
people; be natural and you'll help a lot. —N. S.

on his clothing. Be tactful and tell him about it.
3. Don't go into great detail when helping
him find a seat. Just put his hand on the back
of the chair and he'll do the rest. Don't push
him into the chair.
4. Don't overlook the soldier's proffered hand
when being introduced to him.
5. Don't be stickily sentimental. Treat the
soldier casually or don't talk to him at all.
6. Don't overlook the blind soldier. Ask him
questions directly and not over his head; let
him order a meal if you're dining out.
7. Don't buy a blind soldier something to
eat or drink unless you're willing to have him
buy an occasional round.
8. Don't try to lift him up a stairway. He's
all right physically.
All that these men want or need is our friend
ship and common courtesy. Without an ex
cess or lack of tact, we can aid them to feel at
home in their social contacts. They're just plain
people; be natural and you'll help a lot. —N. S.
