### PEGGY FITTS 
Hubba hubba! The pahty time of the silly season is
with us again; namely, the Spring Show, Ram's Head's
white hope for the sun-tan quarter.
This is everyone's fat chance to join the exclusive
Baggy-Eyes-and-Dirty-Knees Club, and find out what
backstage feels like (it feels fine). Here we find one
organization that hasn't been pushed to the wall by
the meat shortage—they claim a corner on the local
ham output, which is nothing if not terrific, judging by
happy memories of the Pow-Wow, "The Phantom Em
pire," and the boys from the penthouse publication
Out of the bushes, spotlight-lovers—this is your big
moment.
Tryouts tonight and tomorrow night will be con
ducted along the usual informal lines (kind looks and
word for all comers), and talent is absolutely no ob
ject.
Those who know will tell those who want to know
that you don't have to be gifted to pound thumbs and
collect bird-cages (for the birds) and paint racy slo
gans on each other's dungarees. Of course, if you want
to read a part, the proposition is truly a toughie (you
have to know how to read).
Spring Show is one genial feature of a genial time
of year—it wants and welcomes everybody who likes
a good time or giving other people one. Little green
freshmen or middle-sized purple seniors, here is a
slice of those Old Days we're always talking about.
Come join the band—here comes the bandwagon.
