## BRETTON WOODS 
### 
To the Editor:
To publish accurate and reliable information, as well
as to offer wise guidance, are two of the several re
sponsibilities a newspaper has in order to fulfil its role
in society. Yet a certain San Francisco newspaper,
noted for its distortion of the news, has deviated so far
from its responsibilities that it is time Stanford students
be made aware of its unfair attack on Bretton Woods
plan.
Typical of this attack is a series of articles now
appearing daily in this newspaper, written by a "so
called" authority. These articles are not only unin
telligent, but use all the little propaganda devices
that social psychologists are acquainted with. Name
calling is used in an attempt to appeal to the emotions;
generalities are used which are vague with no mean
ing to the intelligent thinker. The author of these ar
ticles is very shrewd; he knows he couldn't get away
with an obvious falsehood so he very skillfully creates
a series of half truths calculated to have enough ver
acity to lend them credence. In this respect only is he
•an expert.
Another of the propaganda devices used is the play
ing up of a particular side of an issue and the playing
down of the other. A newspaper story can be played
up by using large headlines and body type, a front
page display, or any other typographical device calcu
lated to catch the eye. A story can be played down
by either not printing it, or by putting it far back in
the paper. In the case of the Bretton Woods plan the
opposition of the paper in question has been highly
emphasized with little or no opportunity for favorable
comment.
It behooves every Stanford student to study this
newspaper's con argument closely, because this series
of articles on the Bretton Woods plan is distorting the
facts with a lot of verbal nonsense which does much to
confuse intelligent debate of the issues involved.
No one can condemn fair and accurate opposition to
a plan or problem, but he has the right, especially with
successful international organization at stake, to expect
an intelligent debate of the real issues involved.
