## WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN GERMANY NEXT? 
### Elliot Epsteen 
(Continued)

It is certainly apparent that the
temper of the world is for strong
peace terms for Germany. It will be
interesting to see what they will look
like in detail, but they will logically
be either in the form of a temporary
military occupaton or an actual par- j
tition .
The temporary occupation might
also function in two ways. Either
the various Allied governments |
will each have a separate zone to
administer, or will handle every
thing jointly.
Walter Lippmann seems to think
that the latter is in the offing. The
idea might very well be designed to
preserve inter-Allied unity, but the |
whole thing will become so cumber- !
some, since the administrators will 1
have to look out for the interests of
three different nations as well as !
govern the Germans, that the only
reason the various states would stay
in it would be to prevent the other
ones from gaining valuable military
bases in Germany.
Anything as tedious as that would
probably result in the abandonment
of the project by joint resolution,
thus bringing the balance of power
back to where it was, and with Ger
many holding ill feeling toward ev
erybody in general.
An actual political partition would
be much more desirable, since each
nation involved would get positive
economic and military gains out of
it. By giving the French control of
the Rhineland and Ruhr, France
could be brought up to enough of a
power to compensate for Marshal
Stalin's gains in East Europe and in
prestige.
But the partition, to be effective,
would have to be as complete as
possible. The history of the last
twenty-five years shows, if anything,
that the principle "never mistreat a
nation by halves," while Machiavel
lian, is sound.
There are arguments against such
a course, however, but they seem
refutable.
First is the idea put forth by
followers, and perhaps misreprc
senters, of certain modern eco
nomic doctrines, who say that such
a course would so upset the econ
omy of Europe that it would bring
financial catastrophe. To this can
be said, Rcynaud Co. would prob
ably run the Krupp works just as
efficiently as their present man
agement.
Secondly, certain advanced demo
crats are saying that such a partition

wouldn't stick, because the German
national spirit would have to be
coped with, and is probably too
coped with, and is probably too
strong. But in these days of motor
ized armies with high fire power, a
small garrison could probably keep
the Germans efficiently subjugated.
Also, the more humane the occupa
tion is, the smaller will be the num
ber of people who are willing to risk
the hazards of guerilla warfare.
The main argument, however,
against such a course is that it will
simply leave the world in a state
of balance of power, where it was
before.
This is solely a question to be
decided by the people of the world.
No matter how the peace is writ
ten, the conditions of our time will
leave as many opportunities for
international collaboration as there
will be for international friction.
If the peoples of the world ask
for a world prosperity bloc instead
of an Eastern and Western Euro
pean power bloc, then there will
he no balance of power. If the
dream of such men as Briand,
however, is still visionary, then a
balanced system of states will at
least leave the victims of the next
aggression a fighting chance for
national survival.
Then what will happen next in
Germany will probably not decide
the problems of the world, but only
those of Germany, and the German
problem of her neighbors. Nobody
seems in the mood for treating Ger
many lightly, and. if we did, it might
make France and Russia feel that we
are playing her against them. Then
it is again a question of half or whole
measures in respect to her.

govern the Germans, that the only
reason the various states would stay
in it would be to prevent the other
ones from gaining valuable military
bases in Germany.
Anything as tedious as that would
probably result in the abandonment
of the project by joint resolution,
thus bringing the balance of power
back to where it was, and with Ger
many holding ill feeling toward ev
erybody in general.
An actual political partition would
be much more desirable, since each
nation involved would get positive
economic and military gains out of
it. By giving the French control of
the Rhineland and Ruhr, France
could be brought up to enough of a
power to compensate for Marshal
Stalin's gains in East Europe and in
prestige.
But the partition, to be effective,
would have to be as complete as
possible. The history of the last
twenty-five years shows, if anything,
that the principle "never mistreat a
nation by halves," while Machiavel
lian, is sound.
There are arguments against such
a course, however, but they seem
refutable.
First is the idea put forth by
followers, and perhaps misreprc
senters, of certain modern eco
nomic doctrines, who say that such
a course would so upset the econ
omy of Europe that it would bring
financial catastrophe. To this can
be said, Rcynaud Co. would prob
ably run the Krupp works just as
efficiently as their present man
agement.
Secondly, certain advanced demo
crats are saying that such a partition

wouldn't stick, because the German
national spirit would have to be
coped with, and is probably too
coped with, and is probably too
strong. But in these days of motor
ized armies with high fire power, a
small garrison could probably keep
the Germans efficiently subjugated.
Also, the more humane the occupa
tion is, the smaller will be the num
ber of people who are willing to risk
the hazards of guerilla warfare.
The main argument, however,
against such a course is that it will
simply leave the world in a state
of balance of power, where it was
before.
This is solely a question to be
decided by the people of the world.
No matter how the peace is writ
ten, the conditions of our time will
leave as many opportunities for
international collaboration as there
will be for international friction.
If the peoples of the world ask
for a world prosperity bloc instead
of an Eastern and Western Euro
pean power bloc, then there will
he no balance of power. If the
dream of such men as Briand,
however, is still visionary, then a
balanced system of states will at
least leave the victims of the next
aggression a fighting chance for
national survival.
Then what will happen next in
Germany will probably not decide
the problems of the world, but only
those of Germany, and the German
problem of her neighbors. Nobody
seems in the mood for treating Ger
many lightly, and. if we did, it might
make France and Russia feel that we
are playing her against them. Then
it is again a question of half or whole
measures in respect to her.
