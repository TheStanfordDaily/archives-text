# Orient Must Have Freedom Or War--â€”Hayes
## 
### KENNETH SCHUG 
"Failure of America to uphold the
Atlantic Charter on behalf of the
peoples of the Orient will lead in
evitably to World War III." With
this statement, Dr. C. Pearce Hayes,
a missionary in India from 1921 to
1944, began a discussion of the rela
tion of China to world peace at the
Wesley Foundation meeting Sunday
afternoon.
Dr. Hayes reported that the people
of China are asking the world today
two questions about the problems of
world peace. The first is, "Will the
White man apply the Atlantic Char
ter to Asia or return to his former
imperialism?" Dr. Hayes believes
that if the western powers attempt
to exploit Asia as they have in the
past, the next generation will witness
a terrible war between the white
and non-white peoples of the earth.
The second question China asks
is, "Can Christianity provide a basis
for world peace?" The former mis
sionary here stressed the importance
of "practical Christianity," which ac
tively attempts to "change life" in
accordance with its ideals. One of
the important aspects of this prob
lem, he pointed out, is the treatment
of racial mnority groups within our
own country, which exei'ts a tremen
dous effect on Oriental attittudes to
ward America and the white man in
general.
In closing, Dr. Hayes asserted that
world peace will demand the sacri
fice of the personal short range in
terests of the United States, Great
Britain, and Russia.
