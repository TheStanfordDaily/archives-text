# April 16 Is Deadline For Study Changes
## 
### 
Monday, April 1(5, is the last day
students may change their study lists
for this quarter without fine. After
April 16 all program revisions must
be made by petition to the Regis
tration Committee, subject to the
following fines: $2 for each course
added or dropped, or $3 where one
course is substituted for another.
All program changes made since

courses which do not appear there
