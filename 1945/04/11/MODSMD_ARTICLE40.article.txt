# Softball Starts Tomorrow Night

### BOB GILKEY 
Sports-minded Stanford!tes finally
get a chance to root for their favor
ite teams as the intramural softball
season swings into action tomorrow
evening. A trio of contests are slated
for the sunken diamond starting at
7:15.
For opening night the schedule
finds Tyler battling the Legal Eagles,
while Buchanan faces the USA and
Toyon tangles with Phi Psi. The
championship Monroe ten draws a
bye.
The Hilltoppers from Tyler, claim
ing to be the best-dressed team in
the league, expect a far superior
team to the last-place aggregation of
last summer and will probably reign
as favorites over the Eagles, who
represent a rather unknown quan
tity.
The Army team represents a dan
gerous threat to the pennant con
tenders, although not much is known
of their actual personnel. Buchanan
doesn't look too strong at this stage
of the game and will probably .suc
cumb to the soldiers.
The Phi Psi-Toyon game is a toss
up, with neither team regarded as
a potential pennant winner. The Phi
Psis are relying heavily on stars
from their basketball team.
The complete schedule is not yet
available, but for Tuesday, April 17,
the schedule pits Monroe against Ty
ler, Buchanan against the LegÂ»il
Eagles, and the USA against Toyon.
On Thursday, April 19, Monroe
meets the Phi Psis, with Buchanan
facing Tyler and Toyon colliding
with the Legal Eagles. Phi Psi draws
a bye next Tuesday and the USA
rests on Thursday.
