### BOB SLOBE 
When your writer witnessed the
California vs. San .Jose State baseball
game last Saturday, he noticed many
; things. The "Bears" were definitely
superioi. Naturally, they had a
larger amount of material to choose
from; three fair pitchers, a number
of better-than-average batters. But
the odd thing was that San Jose
i State even had a team on the dia
' mond. The total enrollment at San
Jose does not number over 800 stu-
I dents; the ratio of women to men is
almost 10-1. Following the Stanford
policy, I would assume that it was
impossible for the "Spartans" to field
a team with so few men to work
j with. True, they made costly errors.
I and the two homeruns that Boh
Hogeboom whacked out would have
been easy chances to an experienced
outfielder, but the "Slaters" bad a
team that was in there all the way.
What I am trying to do is search
| for an answer to the question: Why
can't Stanford field a baseball team?
| If there is an answer, why isn't it
; made public? Will" w£ lose prestige
if we put forth a squad that doesn't
live up to previous standards? Los
ing a game to Cal will not be un
usual; it has happened before.
Public opinion, in this case stu
dent opinion, is a powerful weapon,
and the Daily sports staff is inter
ested in the sentiments of anyone
who has anything to say about the
possibility or impossibility of hav
; ing a team wearing Stanford colors
j enter into intercollegiate competi
tion.
If you want to see a good Coast
League baseball tussle, wait until
the Oakland "Acorns" play Los
Angeles at Oakland. Both teams
have been murdering all the pitch
i ers they have come up against with
barrages of hits unequaled in Coast
League history. Vic Picetti, who
played his sand lot days in Oak
land. has compiled a sensational
i . 435 batting average for the first
| two weeks of league play. The
I player with the most colorful his
tory is Lou Novikoff, the "Mad
Russian."
Low began his career as a Softball
chucker while he was working in the
oil fields, and gradually worked his
way into major league via the Los
Angeles "Angels." Lou had been up
to the "Cubs" twice now. but he
never quite made the grade because
the "Cubs" won't let him hit the
way he wants to. He has actually
hit homeruns by slugging balls that
were pitched over his head. He is
so-to-speak a major league ball
player playing for a minor league
| club, for the "Cubs" won't sell him
j to any of the numerous major league
outfits that want him.
On the whole baseball promises to
be more entertaining to the crowds
this year because of the lack of good
pitchers and the abundance of slug
gers.

way into major league via the Los
Angeles "Angels." Lou had been up
to the "Cubs" twice now. but he
never quite made the grade because
the "Cubs" won't let him hit the
way he wants to. He has actually
hit homeruns by slugging balls that
were pitched over his head. He is
so-to-speak a major league ball
player playing for a minor league
| club, for the "Cubs" won't sell him
j to any of the numerous major league
outfits that want him.
On the whole baseball promises to
be more entertaining to the crowds
this year because of the lack of good
pitchers and the abundance of slug
gers.
When your writer witnessed the
California vs. San .Jose State baseball
game last Saturday, he noticed many
; things. The "Bears" were definitely
superioi. Naturally, they had a
larger amount of material to choose
from; three fair pitchers, a number
of better-than-average batters. But
the odd thing was that San Jose
i State even had a team on the dia
' mond. The total enrollment at San
Jose does not number over 800 stu-
I dents; the ratio of women to men is
almost 10-1. Following the Stanford
policy, I would assume that it was
impossible for the "Spartans" to field
a team with so few men to work
j with. True, they made costly errors.
I and the two homeruns that Boh
Hogeboom whacked out would have
been easy chances to an experienced
outfielder, but the "Slaters" bad a
team that was in there all the way.
What I am trying to do is search
| for an answer to the question: Why
can't Stanford field a baseball team?
| If there is an answer, why isn't it
; made public? Will" w£ lose prestige
if we put forth a squad that doesn't
live up to previous standards? Los
ing a game to Cal will not be un
usual; it has happened before.
Public opinion, in this case stu
dent opinion, is a powerful weapon,
and the Daily sports staff is inter
ested in the sentiments of anyone
who has anything to say about the
possibility or impossibility of hav
; ing a team wearing Stanford colors
j enter into intercollegiate competi
tion.
If you want to see a good Coast
League baseball tussle, wait until
the Oakland "Acorns" play Los
Angeles at Oakland. Both teams
have been murdering all the pitch
i ers they have come up against with
barrages of hits unequaled in Coast
League history. Vic Picetti, who
played his sand lot days in Oak
land. has compiled a sensational
i . 435 batting average for the first
| two weeks of league play. The
I player with the most colorful his
tory is Lou Novikoff, the "Mad
Russian."
Low began his career as a Softball
chucker while he was working in the
oil fields, and gradually worked his
way into major league via the Los
Angeles "Angels." Lou had been up
to the "Cubs" twice now. but he
