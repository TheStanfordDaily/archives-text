# Luce Triumphs In U.C. Meet
## 
### 
Returning to the form that made
him the champion that he is, Ed Luce
1 went over to Cal last Saturday and
put on an exhibition of high jump
ing that stood out among great exhi
bitions of track. After his opponents
had dropped out at about 5'9", Luce
i continued and finally stopped at
I 6'2". This in itself is not too spec
i tacular for Luce, but considering
the fact that the season is just start
ing and that the competition was not
keen, Luce did very "well for him
self. He left little doubt in the minds
of all those attending that the high
jump is really his event.
Another Stanford man. Emery Hil
ler, also dropped in on Cal and
showed the spectators what a good
discus man could do. It became a
contest between Hiller and Cal's All- I
i Coast Center, Roger Harding, and
I Hiller won.
