Stanford's Hot Jazz Society was
organized in the interest of gather
ing together all Stanford students
who are interested in hot jazz, or
those who wish to learn something
about it. The club was organized
by Joanne Schipp, former president
of the San Jose Hot Jazz Society,
and Juanita Smith of San Francisco.
Miss Schipp was elected president of
the Stanford group. Miss Smith and
Charlotte Tilton were elected vice
president and treasurer respectively.
The group meets every Monday
night to listen to and discuss various
records. There are several different
types of hot jazz and the members
of the group vary widely in their
likes and dislikes. Jazz music is not
that played by Harry James, Stan
Kenton, etc., which is arranged mu
sic. Jazz expresses the feelings of
the player and since much of it is
unarranged the tune varies each time
it is played, according to the musi
cian's mood.
New Orleans' Original Jazz Style
Among the different types of jazz
records played by the group are:
New Orleans. Blues, Chicago. Boog
ie-woogie, and Kansas City. New
Orleans jazz is named for the city
where it started and it is the original

jazz style. The best known of all
New Orleans musicians is Louis
Armstrong, a cornetist, who is often
referred to as King Louis. As the
musicians left New Orleans and went
up the Mississippi, jazz was spread
over the country and the other types
came into being. Outside of New
Orleans, Chicago is perhaps the best
known style and such musicians as
Jack Teagarden, Eddie Condon and
Pee Wee Russell are well known.
Former players of the Chicago style,
who now lead bands are Benny
Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and Artie
Shaw.
The Hot Jazz Society has planned
several different programs for the
quarter with such guests as Phil
Elwood of Berkeley, who has one of
the best jazz record collections on
the coast, and Jim Emerson of Sun
nyvale, whose record collection is
known throughout the country. Oth
er programs, each featuring a differ
ent type of jazz, will be put on by
the various members of the society
during the quarter. The first pro
gram of the quarter featured the
music of Duke Ellington from 1928
to the present. Ellington's band is
probably the only big organization
which plays jazz constantly.
Members of the student body and
faculty, who would be interested in
learning about jazz and how it differs
from popular music are cordially in
vited to attend the meetings, wheh
are held every Monday night in the
Y room of the Women's Clubhouse.

Students and members of the fac
ulty who have their own jazz record
collections are invited to come and
present a program of their own
sometime.

Stanford's Hot Jazz Society was
organized in the interest of gather
ing together all Stanford students
who are interested in hot jazz, or
those who wish to learn something
about it. The club was organized
by Joanne Schipp, former president
of the San Jose Hot Jazz Society,
and Juanita Smith of San Francisco.
Miss Schipp was elected president of
the Stanford group. Miss Smith and
Charlotte Tilton were elected vice
president and treasurer respectively.
The group meets every Monday
night to listen to and discuss various
records. There are several different
types of hot jazz and the members
of the group vary widely in their
likes and dislikes. Jazz music is not
that played by Harry James, Stan
Kenton, etc., which is arranged mu
sic. Jazz expresses the feelings of
the player and since much of it is
unarranged the tune varies each time
it is played, according to the musi
cian's mood.
New Orleans' Original Jazz Style
Among the different types of jazz
records played by the group are:
New Orleans. Blues, Chicago. Boog
ie-woogie, and Kansas City. New
Orleans jazz is named for the city
where it started and it is the original

jazz style. The best known of all
New Orleans musicians is Louis
Armstrong, a cornetist, who is often
referred to as King Louis. As the
musicians left New Orleans and went
up the Mississippi, jazz was spread
over the country and the other types
came into being. Outside of New
Orleans, Chicago is perhaps the best
known style and such musicians as
Jack Teagarden, Eddie Condon and
Pee Wee Russell are well known.
Former players of the Chicago style,
who now lead bands are Benny
Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and Artie
Shaw.
The Hot Jazz Society has planned
several different programs for the
quarter with such guests as Phil
Elwood of Berkeley, who has one of
the best jazz record collections on
the coast, and Jim Emerson of Sun
nyvale, whose record collection is
known throughout the country. Oth
er programs, each featuring a differ
ent type of jazz, will be put on by
the various members of the society
during the quarter. The first pro
gram of the quarter featured the
music of Duke Ellington from 1928
to the present. Ellington's band is
