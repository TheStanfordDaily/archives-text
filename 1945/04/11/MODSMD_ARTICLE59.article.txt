# Freshmen Are Key Part Of Housing Plan--—McClure
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
(Editorial note. — This is the
fourth in our series of articles on
| Stanford's postwar outlook. In in
terviewing Marylou McClure, we
asked her particularly about wom
en's housing, feeling that she was
well qualified to discuss this as
' student-body vice - president and
member of the Housing Commit
tee.)
Freshman entertainment is a key
part of the new housing plan, and it
will begin next week-end, said Miss
McClure.

It will be impartial entertainment
designed for all freshmen women.
They will have a chance to sec the
interiors of possible living groups be
fore choosing their new houses. They
can then choose with open eyes.
But. Miss McClure explained that
the emphasis on meeting specific
people will come later in the quarter,
that the open houses of next week
end will be for showing freshmen the
buildings alone. There will be no
refreshments, and it is not compul
sory for the occupants of the living
units to be at home.
Open Houses
The plan begins with a series of
open houses on April 13, 14, and 15
from 2 to 5 in the afternoon, during
which all women's groups will be
open to the freshman women. Sim
ilar open houses will be held dur
ing the quarter, and individual
houses will be encouraged to enter
tain freshman corridors before room
drawings.
Entertainment will start imme
diately, explained Miss McClure, but
other parts of the housing pro
gram are still being considered by
ihe Administration. Before passing
it, they must examine it carefully
from every angle.
Some recommendations may be fi
nancially impractical, and others will
have to wait until after the war is
over. For instance, kitchcns could
not he put in all units until war de
mands are filled.
The length of the war will also
affect the housing space which is
available for women.

When asked what part of Stanford
she liked best. Miss McClure praised
our growing community spi lit.. She
likes our growing enthusiasm for
campus activities-—everything from
singing "Old Mac Donald" on a hike
with the University President to
flocking to assemblies and cheering
on the faculty singers.
She also liked our increasing in
terest in student government and the

number of students who crowded
Excom and Housing Committee with
opinions and suggestions. She liked
our quick responses to suggested
Honor Code changes.
She had several suggestions for
improving Stanford. Some were
changes that don't have to wait until
the war is over.
Committee Changes
Outstanding was her criticism of
our present committee system.
Charirmen choose the same people
over and over. A small group mo
nopolizes the committees. One so
lution has been suggested but not
very widely used. If chairmen will
only call house presidents they can
find numerous new people with the
talent and interest for all kinds of
committee work.
"The importance of house presi
dents should be stressed more fully,"
stated Miss McClure. They are im
portant in student government as
well as their houses' activities. They
should be elected for interest and
ability as well as popularity.
Miss McClure has other dreams
for Stanford's future. Foremost is
a new and better Student Union. It
will have a larger music listening
lounge, and a room for evening en
tertainment.
Eventually, she hopes, we will do
away with the smaller houses of the
Union Unit. We can then build at
tractive houses for about 35 girls
apiece. Such units could run co
operatively, and each could have its
own kitchen.
Miss McClure's final hope con
cerned the old Stanford relics which
are now sealed away in a library
room where few of us even know
about them. If they were brought
out in public we could enjoy these
old dance bids and frosh bibles. Most
of all we could appreciate the origi
nal cardinal red handkerchief which

a Stanford girl waved at one of our
first football games. It made Car
dinal our school coolr.

(Editorial note. — This is the
fourth in our series of articles on
| Stanford's postwar outlook. In in
terviewing Marylou McClure, we
asked her particularly about wom
en's housing, feeling that she was
well qualified to discuss this as
' student-body vice - president and
member of the Housing Commit
tee.)
Freshman entertainment is a key
part of the new housing plan, and it
will begin next week-end, said Miss
McClure.

It will be impartial entertainment
designed for all freshmen women.
They will have a chance to sec the
interiors of possible living groups be
fore choosing their new houses. They
can then choose with open eyes.
But. Miss McClure explained that
the emphasis on meeting specific
people will come later in the quarter,
that the open houses of next week
end will be for showing freshmen the
buildings alone. There will be no
refreshments, and it is not compul
sory for the occupants of the living
units to be at home.
Open Houses
The plan begins with a series of
open houses on April 13, 14, and 15
from 2 to 5 in the afternoon, during
which all women's groups will be
open to the freshman women. Sim
ilar open houses will be held dur
ing the quarter, and individual
houses will be encouraged to enter
tain freshman corridors before room
drawings.
Entertainment will start imme
diately, explained Miss McClure, but
other parts of the housing pro
gram are still being considered by
ihe Administration. Before passing
it, they must examine it carefully
from every angle.
Some recommendations may be fi
nancially impractical, and others will
have to wait until after the war is
over. For instance, kitchcns could
not he put in all units until war de
mands are filled.
The length of the war will also
affect the housing space which is
available for women.

When asked what part of Stanford
she liked best. Miss McClure praised
our growing community spi lit.. She
likes our growing enthusiasm for
campus activities-—everything from
singing "Old Mac Donald" on a hike
with the University President to
flocking to assemblies and cheering
on the faculty singers.
She also liked our increasing in
terest in student government and the

number of students who crowded
Excom and Housing Committee with
opinions and suggestions. She liked
our quick responses to suggested
Honor Code changes.
She had several suggestions for
improving Stanford. Some were
changes that don't have to wait until
the war is over.
Committee Changes
Outstanding was her criticism of
our present committee system.
Charirmen choose the same people
over and over. A small group mo
nopolizes the committees. One so
lution has been suggested but not
very widely used. If chairmen will
only call house presidents they can
find numerous new people with the
talent and interest for all kinds of
committee work.
"The importance of house presi
dents should be stressed more fully,"
stated Miss McClure. They are im
portant in student government as
well as their houses' activities. They
should be elected for interest and
ability as well as popularity.
Miss McClure has other dreams
for Stanford's future. Foremost is
a new and better Student Union. It
will have a larger music listening
lounge, and a room for evening en
tertainment.
Eventually, she hopes, we will do
away with the smaller houses of the
Union Unit. We can then build at
tractive houses for about 35 girls
apiece. Such units could run co
operatively, and each could have its
own kitchen.
Miss McClure's final hope con
cerned the old Stanford relics which
are now sealed away in a library
