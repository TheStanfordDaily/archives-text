# Want to Roam With Romany Friday Night?
## 
### MARION MORROW 
Wanna roam?
Come roam along the gypsy way
I Friday in the Women's Clubhouse.
Look through the powerful tele
scope on the balcony of the club
house and see who really keeps the
Hoover Libe light on all night.
Hear a gypsy star-gazer tell of life
on Mars and how to go slumming.
Investigate the rumor that invad
ers from an underground planet drift
over the campus each night.
Play ping pong with your room
mate.
Visit the "gambling den" on the
third floor and bet on horse races.
Have your handwriting analyzed,
your palms read—become an open
book to yourself and your friend.
Gorge yourself on ice cream, coke,
and cake.
Enter the chintz room and chal
lenge a professor to a game of bridge,
gin rummy, or choose your own
weapons.
Dance occasionally while Harry
James swings a baton.
View a "stupendous floor show,"
said the chairman.
Take a chance on a door prize do
nated by Phelps-Terkel.
Greet a gypsy king.
Play musical chairs, and things.
Note the decorations — the magic
forest, the big gypsy camp lire, the
mysterious light, the eerie atmos
phere, the gay costumes, the booti
ful people.
Come stag—it's a good chance to
get to know those people you've been
"hello-ing" on Quad these many
months.
