# California Artists Shown
## 
### ROD BROWNING 
A colorful and interesting exhibit
is now being shown at the Stanford
University Art Gallery. The exhibit
is a collection of 32 water-color
paintings by seven of California's
I most prominent artists.
Millard Sheets is represented by
some paintings which show intense
movement. One of his paintings en
titled "House on the Hill" is a force
ful scene of a house on the top of
a small hill. The house gives the ob
server the impression that it strug
gled to the top of the hill and sat
down there to rest. Mr. Sheets for
many years has exhibited his work
in galleries all over the country.
Nature Studies
There are also three unusual na
! ture paintings by Juanita Vitousek.
| Miss Vitousek paints nature studies
1 with a strikingly bold use of color.
The paintings of Etienne Ret reveal
a rather clear, simple style that has
been called typical of the middle 18th
century French painters.
The well - known art reviewer,
Herman Reuter, said of a painting

by Dan Lutz, "To find one such can
vas a year goes far to compensate
the reviewer for the boredom en
gendered by a hundred of lesser cal
iber." Most of the paintings by Mr.
Lutz on exhibition in the gallery now
are down in greens and blues. With
the extreme intensity of color that
Mr. Lutz uses, his pictures have a
sparkle and liveliness which make
them outstanding in the water-color
field.
Water Colors
Loren Barton, Who has several
water-colors on exhibit, is also an
able artist of oil paintings. Versa
tility, clarity of expression and a
highly original style are the char
acteristics attributed to Loren Bar
ton's work.
Precision and technical mastery of
painting are §een in the Russell
Cowel paintings. He has the ability
to use gay color with complete de
tail, as is shown in hi.s painting
of city buildings called "Vertical
World." Another interesting paint
ing of his is the picture "Two Fami
lies" which shows a mother, father,
and their baby looking at a group
of penguins in a zoo.
These seven California artists will
have on exhibit this May at the Art
Gallery some of their oil paintings.
This will give the students and visi
tors a chance to compare the oil with
the water-colr paintings now at the
gallery.
