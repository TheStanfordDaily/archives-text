# Farm Scientists Watch 30,000 Seedlings Develop
## 
### 
Thirty thousand seedlings are now
being grown at the Carnegie plant
laboratory at Stanford from which
the scientists expect to obtain a one
per cent yield of hybrid grasses,
according to recent figures. Last year
in the same experimental work 32
hybrid grasses of great promise were
discovered.
The most spectacular grass dis
covered so far was developed by
crossing a vigorous productive
bunchgrass from Washington state
and with a hardy Lapland blue grass
from north of the Arctic Circle.
Another hybrid that has interested
scientists as that created by the
crossing of the same giant Washing
ton bunchgrass with a strain of Ken- j
tueky bluegrass.
Test Grasses
These hybrid grasses are tested for
climatic adaptability in different al
titudes before being brought to Stan
ford. After testing, the plants are
turned over to Dr. H. A. Spoehr and I
his group for final testing and utili- I
zation.
Dr. Spoehr's work is to apply new- I
ly developed principles of plant re- |
lationships to the breeding of for- !
age grasses. The Carnegie scientist, j
director of the Division of Plant Bi
ology of the Institution, hopes that
these new principles may help save
the western range, now depleted
through overgrazing and drought to
less than 50 per cent of what they
were in the days of the pioneers.
Predicts Desert
If exploitation is allowed to con
tinue because of political and eco
nomic shortsightedness and lack of

vigorous expression of scientific
facts, Dr. Spoehr predicts that vast
tracts of the western range, which
comprises 40 per cent of the total
land area of the United States, will
turn into a virtual desert.
The breeding experiments which
begun in 1943 under Dr. Spoehr's
supervision are a cooperative project
between the Carnegie Institution and
the United States Soil Conservation
Service. Dr. Spoehr's associates are
Drs. Jens Clauson. David Keck, and
William M. Hieseu who carry on the
work in the specially designed (
breeding cages and greenhouses at
the laboratory on campus.
