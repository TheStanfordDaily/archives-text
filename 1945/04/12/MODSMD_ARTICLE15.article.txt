# Joffre Debaters Will Meet Today
## 
### 
JofTrc squad will meet today at 1
p.m. in room 200T to continue re
search on the question, "France's
foreign policy from Locarno to San
Francisco," according to Professor
Gordon Emerson, debating director.
Debating Society members who arc
working on the peacetime conscrip
tion question will meet at the same
time and place tomorrow to begin
preparation for the debates to take
place on that subject with Menlo
Junior College and Santa Clara late
this month.
The JofTre Debate is planned for
May 23, when a team from Cal will
come to Stanford to meet a three
man Stanford team in the annual
contest to be held this year in the
Education Auditorium.
"With the San Francisco Confer
ence in session only 30 miles away,
interest in the JofTrc Debate this
year is sure to be unusually great,"
said Carol Newton, debate manager.
Adding to the usual competitive
spirit which surrounds the tradition
al big clash with Cal is the fact that
the winner of this year's debate will
break the tie which now exists and
win for his school the majority of
JofTre victories, according to Profes
sor Emerson, who recently made a
study of the history of JofTrc de
bates for Gavel magazine.
