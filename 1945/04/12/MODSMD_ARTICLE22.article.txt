# Guys, Gals, Gags at 'Y' Party Time Tomorrow
## Gypsy Mystery To Hold Spell Over Friday's Gaieties 
### 
Definitely a "no-date unless you absolutely can't stand to be alone"
affair, the Y "Gypsy Night" is now pulling rabbits, telescopes, and gam
bling dens out of the bag and sticking them in the Women's Clubhouse
for tomorrow night.
On the balcony of the clubhouse will be a powerful telescope which

► wil reveal at last who keeps that
light burning in the top of the Hoo
ver Libc all night long. Think what
a twist of the wrist might reveal to
you.
A gypsy star gazer imported di
rectly from Lagunita will explain
the not-so-unusual sights which
may be seen through this tele
scope.
If you zoom immediately to the
third floor of the clubhouse you can
i progressive ping pong games
j and receive prizes, if you win. There
I will also be the "Gambling Den" on
j the third floor. Prizes will be given
for playing the right hunch.
Handwriting experts and palm
ists with phenomenal powers of
perception, according to their re
commedations, will be present on
the third floor, too. It takes high
I altitude to concentrate on most of
i the Stanford population's grimy
palms.
In the chintz room you may chal
lenge your favorite professor to a
game of bridge, gin rummy, or etc.
Pretzels and popcorn will be avail
able as well as coke, ice cream, and
cake.
•
In the middle of the evening all
dancing will be halted for a floor
show - , the presentation of the gyp
sy king and the drawing for the
door prizes which have been do
nated by Phclps-Terkcl.
The atmosphere is what's impress
ing. That big caravan and gypsy fire
as you wander in, the colorful cos
tunics, the purty girls, the mysteri
ous lighting—all this and refresh
ments too.
