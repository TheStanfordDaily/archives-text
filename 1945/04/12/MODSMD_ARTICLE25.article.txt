# GETTING TOGETHER
## TO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC EXERCISES 
### 
Though since our Western Civ days we have
been exposed to one spiritual blow after an
other, we are hardly prepared to face the prob
lems thrown before Excom last night concern
ing the difficulties of executing the new elec
tion system, revised by the referendum on
Tuesday.
Despite the problem of acguainting both stu
dent election officials and voters with the tech
niques involved, there is the ever-present diffi
culty of inducing voters to really know what
the candidates, offices, and problems are about.
We have usually depended on student as
semblies the day of the election to at least pro
vide curiosity for investigation of the candidate's
possibilities.
Now this assembly has become a problem
tossed into Excom's crowded lap, with the an
nouncement that the Committee on Public Ex
ercises has already formulated a policy against
allowing election assemblies.
We hope at this time that the committee will
see the desirability of breaking the policy. Not
only is the election more difficult this spring,
but its success should be doubly guaranteed so
that the new Excom system will get off to a
start that will insure a fair trial.
Beyond this we wish to emphasize that the
major problem and major defect in student
affairs has been the lack of things to do to
gether, places to go together, and the conse
quent attainment of a group feeling.
The stinging loss of athletics is primarily to
blame, but if this must be so, we hope that the
necessity for other kinds of group meetings will
be realized. The election assembly would help
to provide this.
The reasons againsi it are understandable. It
t ikes class-time, which is undesirable. Some
students stay away, which is also undesirable.
We feel, however, that things have always oc
curred and have been excused.
Professors can usually overcome lost class
time; few courses ever meet on all the appointed
days throughout a quarter anyway. The stu
dents who will go to the assembly are the ones
that the Executive Committee can afford to
worry about, as those who don't vote can't be
expected to vote anyway.
We know because of Dr. Tresidder's talk to
night, and the talk later this quarter by ex-Daily
Editor W. Parmer Fuller, Jr., that something has
been done to overcome this unfortunate situ
ation.
We hope that understanding of this student
problem will permit the Committee on Public
Exercises to aid the arrangements for a student
election assembly.
