# "CALIFORNIA STORY"
## 
### 
The battered roof of the Daily Shack raised
slightly this week as editors read a little item
from the editorial columns of the Daily Califor
nian about being "the only student-owned, stu
dent-controlled newspaper in the West"! That,
we thought, is too much, so from the little white
.'hack beside the Press building we issue a
statement: The Stanford Daily is student-owned
nnd student-controlled, and wishes to be recog
nized as such.
We were also struck by the first sentence of
the editorial "The Californian has no editorial
policy" and we're tempted to add that the
Deiily does have an editorial policy and is proud
of it. Contending that an individual or a news
paper can be so open-minded that he or it be
(- mes vacant minded, the Daily has tried to pre

sent both sides of an issue, but then attempts,
if possible, to come to a decision or take a stand
and relay that position to the campus in its edi
torial columns.
The Daily editorial policy is again reflected
in feature stories written oy staif members who
are getting the facts and tapping the vast and
invaluable sources of knowledge at Stanford
through interviews with professors and other
University leaders on political, economic, and
social guestions —the history of the past and
the plans for the future.
We don't term ourselves "monarch of the
college dailies," Cal; but yes, we're student
owned, student-controlled; over 2,000 members
of the A.S.S.U. will tell you that!—H. D.
