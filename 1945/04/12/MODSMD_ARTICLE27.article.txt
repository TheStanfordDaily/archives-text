CULTIVATION OF AUTHORITY

"Off with his head," screamed the Queen of Hearts,
gesticulating wildly in the direction of the Cheshire
Cat, and jumping angrily up and down on the croquet
lawn. "But how can you chop of! his head," asked Alice
in a puzzled voice, "if he hasn't any body?" "Hmmm,"
said the Queen thoughtfully, "That's none of your
business." And she kicked Alice's hedgehog (Alice was
trying to play croquet with a hedgehog for a ball) out
of position for the next wicket.
"And why do you want to chop off the head of such
a nice cat?" said Alice, "He really looks very well with
it on." "It's a matter of policy," admitted the Queen.
"You see, it is really much too hard to try and decide
what is good and what is bad on the merits of the
case; I daresay that if I were to think it over, I should
find out that it is the wisest thing not to chop off his
head."
"Then why do you go about having everyone's head
removed?" asked Alice, "if you know that sometimes
it is a mistake; I am sure that some people must miss
their heads."
"Yes, unfortunately they do complain," said the
Queen, disentangling the beak of Alice's Flamingo
(which Alice was using as a croquet mallet) from
her hair; "but I have neither the time nor the pa
tience for being reasonable. It is much easier to he
consistent and decisive if one acts upon purely per
sonal feelings, and disregards the facts of the case."
Alice was quite perplexed at this idea, but was dis
tracted for a moment as she tried to separate two
hedgehogs, each of which was fighting to prevent the
other from crawling through a wicket.
"You see," continued the Queen, who was strolling
along, quite unconcerned by the squabbling hedgehogs,
"it is really much better to give up pretending that one
is trying to be good or Christian; most of us are either
hypocrites or have given up such ideas already."'
"Oh dear," sighed Alice, "I really did want to learn
how to be nice without being a hypocrite, and now you
tell me that it's impossible!"
"Why no!" said the Queen, staring perplexedly at
Alice, "I said nothing of the sort. It is perfectly pos
sible to be a really very nice person, almost a sort of
a Christian, (in the better sense of the word), except
that it is a great deal of trouble. And. for a person
in my position of authority, where I have dignity and
position to preserve, it is quite Impractical."
"Whhrumph," suddenly exclaimed the Queen, as she
tripped over a wicket that stood in her path, tore it from
the lawn, and sent the hedgehogs flying. "Just mind
your own business," she continued from her position on
the ground, "do what you're told, and only be nasty to
people who can't protect themselves. One's bound to
hurt some people's feelings, so only hurt those people
you don't know or understand, and make sure that
/ou don't get to know the people whose feelings you
hurt."
"You're so discouraging," said Alice, frowning, "be
cause I don't like being nasty or unpleasant, and I
don't really think I want to be."
"Oh don't worry about that," consoled the Queen in
a comforting tone, "with a little practice and with the
aid of the prejudices that quite naturally come with
age, you will be quite capable of being as unpleasant as
any of us."
"However," she added reflectively, "like all moral
principles, narrowness and prejudice require constant
cultivation, and are greatly aided by the formulation of
codes, creeds, churches, and the like."
As though stricken by conscience, she glanced about
to see what had happened to the Cheshire Cat. "What!"
she exclaimed to Alice, "his head isn't off yet! Call
the Executioner! Off with his head!"
