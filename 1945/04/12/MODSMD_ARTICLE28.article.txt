(Ed. note.—Following art* pertinent facts about
the San Francisco United Nations Conference culled
from the flood of information now being made avail- j
able. Such articles will be in the Daily preceding the j
conference until it opens, when closer accounts can
be given.)
In the United Nations' organization the power to !
halt aggression and to prevent war will be vested in the
Security Council of eleven nations including the Big
Five, America, England, Russia, China, and France,
which will hold permanent seats.
The other six nations will be elected for two-year (
terms, three members retiring each year and not sub- j
ject to re-election.
The council will have a military staff, including !
chiefs of staff of the Big Five and contingents of the |
United Nations' armed forces. Of especial impor
tance will be the standing air force used for policing
potential aggressors.
The Security Council will be in continuous session ;
to study disputes as they develop and to recommend
means for peaceful settlement. If countries cannot I
settle disputes by direct negotiation then the Inter
national Court of Justice will serve as a medium for I
conciliation, arbitration, or mediation.
If all attempts at peaceful .settlement of a dispute I
fail then the Security Council will take direct action
by imposing economic sanctions, the suspension of
communication and transportation facilities to the ag
gressor nation, and finally the termination of diplo- I
mate and economic relations. If these actions fail to i
deter the aggressor, then the Council will "take such |
action by air, naval, or land forces as may be necessary j
to maintain or restore international peace and se- I
curity." Members of the organization so far as is !
necessary w ; ll give mutual assistance to the measures !
decided upon by the Security Council.
An important function of (he body will be the
study of disarmament and recommendations for de- '
creasing fighting equipment of the world. The Coun
cil will have supervisory authority over regional
security arrangements, that is for collective security
between nations in a certain region.
Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin at the Yalta meet
ing agreed on a voting plan for the Council. In the j
settlement of disputes by force votes of seven out
of the eleven nations, including unanimity of the Big !
Five, will be required. Steps short of military action :
will require a seven-vote majorty without unanimity J
of the Big Five.

of the Big Five.
(Ed. note.—Following art* pertinent facts about
the San Francisco United Nations Conference culled
from the flood of information now being made avail- j
able. Such articles will be in the Daily preceding the j
conference until it opens, when closer accounts can
be given.)
In the United Nations' organization the power to !
halt aggression and to prevent war will be vested in the
Security Council of eleven nations including the Big
Five, America, England, Russia, China, and France,
which will hold permanent seats.
The other six nations will be elected for two-year (
terms, three members retiring each year and not sub- j
ject to re-election.
The council will have a military staff, including !
chiefs of staff of the Big Five and contingents of the |
United Nations' armed forces. Of especial impor
tance will be the standing air force used for policing
potential aggressors.
The Security Council will be in continuous session ;
to study disputes as they develop and to recommend
means for peaceful settlement. If countries cannot I
settle disputes by direct negotiation then the Inter
national Court of Justice will serve as a medium for I
conciliation, arbitration, or mediation.
If all attempts at peaceful .settlement of a dispute I
fail then the Security Council will take direct action
by imposing economic sanctions, the suspension of
communication and transportation facilities to the ag
gressor nation, and finally the termination of diplo- I
mate and economic relations. If these actions fail to i
deter the aggressor, then the Council will "take such |
action by air, naval, or land forces as may be necessary j
to maintain or restore international peace and se- I
curity." Members of the organization so far as is !
necessary w ; ll give mutual assistance to the measures !
decided upon by the Security Council.
An important function of (he body will be the
study of disarmament and recommendations for de- '
creasing fighting equipment of the world. The Coun
cil will have supervisory authority over regional
security arrangements, that is for collective security
between nations in a certain region.
Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin at the Yalta meet
ing agreed on a voting plan for the Council. In the j
settlement of disputes by force votes of seven out
of the eleven nations, including unanimity of the Big !
Five, will be required. Steps short of military action :
will require a seven-vote majorty without unanimity J
of the Big Five.
