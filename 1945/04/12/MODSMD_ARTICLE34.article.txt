## 
### 
MADRID, April 11 (UP). â€”Spain
broke diplomatic relations with Ja
pan tonight because of Japanese
troop brutalities against Spanish citi
zens in the battle of Manila and re
served the right to claim indemnity
for loss of life and damage.
It was the first break of the gov
ernment of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco, which came to power after a
civil war, with an Axis power. Spain
acted against Japan only after care
ful assembly of reports of Spanish
origin which left no doubt that the
Japanese had stormed the Spanish
consulate in Manila and murdered
consulate officials and others present.
The consulate was burned. Many
other persons of Spanibh origin were
murdered and Japanese troops de
liberately destroyed property of
Spanish citizens. All this was cited
in a formal government statement
announcing ihe break.
