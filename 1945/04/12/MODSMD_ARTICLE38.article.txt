### MORT COHEN 
As we sit in our abode called the
Sports Staff Room, we sit motionless,
quiet, dumbfounded. We don't know
what to say or think. Everything
around us has been shattered; there

is no longer a past; the future is
questionable. We cannot believe
what we read; we can believe noth
ing, nor can we understand. We still
remember the day that resident Rob
ert Gordon Sproul of U.C. issued a
statement to the effect that Stub Al
lison would remain as head football
coach, regardless of the showing of
his teams. And now, we hear that
Allison has been ousted from his
position, that the A.S.U.C. has not
I renewed his contract.
There is nothing for us to say or
do. Allison has been at Cal since
1931 and has been head coach since
< 1935. In his ten years as coach, he
won the Big Game five times, and
lost but three. Probably his greatest
success came in 1937, when he put
out one of the greatest teams the
coast has ever seen. On that team
were Vic Bottari, Sam Chapman,
Dave Anderson, Bob Herwig, Perry
Schwartz, and others. Except for a
tie with Washington, that team went
j undefeated and untied. Another of
his great triumphs was in 1941 when
he brought his Bears against our fa
vored Cardinal team and beat us,
16-0. We hate to say this, but it was
a slaughter. Of course* Marchie
Schwartz got back the next year
with a spectacular 26-7 win over
the Bears: that goes without saying.
Why the Briefness?
The part that we don't understand
about this whole situation is the
briefness of the communique. Cal did
not name a successor. The A.S.U.C.
probably has its eyes on either Com
mander Franck Wickhorst or Lt. Bob
Herwig. Both of these men assisted
Allison and both were great stars in
their day. Wickhorst was an All-
I American center from Minnesota
and Herwig was an All-American
center for Cal on the 1937 team.
Also, Bob is the husband of Kather
ine Windsor, but we hope that this
does not enter in on the selection.
Whatever the selection for a suc
cessor, however, one thing is almost
certain: Cal will not go back on the
old power plays of Allison. If they
intended to remain with straight
power, there would have been no
sense in dismissing Allison, for he is
about the best in the business for
that type of play. Maybe Clark
Shaughnessy was right when he said
that everyone will change over to
the new style of football, the T and
speed. California was one of the few
teams left that was against this sys
tem (even though they worked out
of a T the Bears held on to their old
tactics of two line plays and a kick)
and with the Bears leaving this be
hind. anything can happen.
A NEW DAY?
For all we know the "Golden
Days" of sports might return to
Berkeley and the new "Wonder"
teams might pop up again. Anyway,
Cal is making an effort to do some
thing drastic in the way of sports.

factories for use again«;t the Nazis

lations. A small British island

Now being processed in British
factories for use again«;t the Nazis
is this huge new 11-ton "town
buster" bomb. It is as tall as a
two-story house and is designed
to smash underground factories,
shelters and other military instal
lations. A small British island
was recently wiped out during ex
periments from the terrific force
of the bomb explosion.
As we sit in our abode called the
Sports Staff Room, we sit motionless,
quiet, dumbfounded. We don't know
what to say or think. Everything
around us has been shattered; there

is no longer a past; the future is
questionable. We cannot believe
what we read; we can believe noth
ing, nor can we understand. We still
remember the day that resident Rob
ert Gordon Sproul of U.C. issued a
statement to the effect that Stub Al
lison would remain as head football
coach, regardless of the showing of
his teams. And now, we hear that
Allison has been ousted from his
position, that the A.S.U.C. has not
I renewed his contract.
There is nothing for us to say or
do. Allison has been at Cal since
1931 and has been head coach since
< 1935. In his ten years as coach, he
won the Big Game five times, and
lost but three. Probably his greatest
success came in 1937, when he put
out one of the greatest teams the
coast has ever seen. On that team
were Vic Bottari, Sam Chapman,
Dave Anderson, Bob Herwig, Perry
Schwartz, and others. Except for a
tie with Washington, that team went
j undefeated and untied. Another of
his great triumphs was in 1941 when
he brought his Bears against our fa
vored Cardinal team and beat us,
16-0. We hate to say this, but it was
a slaughter. Of course* Marchie
Schwartz got back the next year
with a spectacular 26-7 win over
the Bears: that goes without saying.
Why the Briefness?
The part that we don't understand
about this whole situation is the
briefness of the communique. Cal did
not name a successor. The A.S.U.C.
probably has its eyes on either Com
mander Franck Wickhorst or Lt. Bob
Herwig. Both of these men assisted
Allison and both were great stars in
their day. Wickhorst was an All-
I American center from Minnesota
and Herwig was an All-American
center for Cal on the 1937 team.
Also, Bob is the husband of Kather
ine Windsor, but we hope that this
does not enter in on the selection.
Whatever the selection for a suc
cessor, however, one thing is almost
certain: Cal will not go back on the
old power plays of Allison. If they
intended to remain with straight
power, there would have been no
sense in dismissing Allison, for he is
about the best in the business for
that type of play. Maybe Clark
Shaughnessy was right when he said
that everyone will change over to
the new style of football, the T and
speed. California was one of the few
teams left that was against this sys
tem (even though they worked out
of a T the Bears held on to their old
tactics of two line plays and a kick)
and with the Bears leaving this be
hind. anything can happen.
