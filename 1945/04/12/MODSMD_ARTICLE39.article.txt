# Tyler, Eagles Clash Tonight
## 
### JOHN GLATHE 
The Spring Quarter intramural
Softball.league opens its schedule to
night when six teams swing into ac
tion. Tonight's contests are between
Tyler and the Legal Eagles. Buchan
an and USA, and Phi Psi's and Toy
on.
Top hilling should be given to j
the Tyler-Legal Eagle tussle. The
Eagles fresh from their mural ca- |
saha tourney triumph are out to j
avenge their only basketball de- j
feat, a loss to Tyler. The Hilltop- '
pers boast an outstanding roster
of veterans returning from last
summer's mural wars. Little is
known about the potentality of the
Eagle squad, but stiff opposition is
expected, goaded by the revenge
motive. Lineups are as follows:
Tyler: Fox, shortstop; Slobe, third
base: Hall, catcher; Pickering, first
base: Ryan. left field; Snell, second
base; Davies, center field: Hjelte.
short center: Clayton, right field; j
Glathe, pitcher.
The tentative Legal Eagle lineup is |
as follows: O'Neill, pitcher; Jarvis,
catcher; Hartwell, first base; Eyman,
second base; Honeysett, outfield;
Husby, short stop; Walt, outfield;
Keller, third base; Anderson, out
field; Baldwin, outfield.
Buchanan presents the proverbial
question mark. They have lost many
of last summer's stars, including
Johnny Mills, Jack Fix. and Joe
Pickering, who has gone up the hill
to Tyler. The mainstays of the Bear
cats' lineup are: Bob Daly, pitcher;
Frank "Slugger" Hoffman, Ed Chris
tie, Charlie McClung, and Shelton
Butt. Nothing is known about the
USA, but with 500 Army men to
choose from they should field a ten
to be reckoned with. We'll give the
edge to the Army in this one.
The Phi Psi-Toyon battle should
i be a bit one-sided. The Phi Psi's are
I fielding a powerful team this season
which will even give the renowned
j Monroe Bozers a terrific fight. The
| Hood-Ashley-Pitts combo form the
I backbone of the squad. Little or
j nothing is known about the abilities
j of Tony Ortega and his team.
All games will begin promptly at
7:15 in the Sunken Diamond. The
I entire campus should come down
to witness these games as they are
Stanford's only bid for athletic
fame.
