# Pens, Shoes, False Teeth; All Are in Lost and Found
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
As a side-line to hei* job as head
cashier, Mrs. Helen Lees is also in
charge of the lost and found depart
ment which is located in one corner
of the Cashier's office on the second
floor of the Ad Building.
All the departments of the school,
including the Police Department and
the Memorial Theater, turn in any
thing they find to this department.
There is always a large conglomera
tion of articles that have not been
claimed. Such things as coats, sweat
ers, gloves, caps, jewelry, fountain
pens, and even shoes are in the
collection.
Wooden Shoes Lost
"One girl left a pair of wooden
shoes in gym and they remained
here in the lost and found for sev
eral months before they were finally
claimed," Mrs. Lees said.
"Every day I get calls from peo
ple who have lost things that they
hope may be turned in," she said. "I
always keep a list and call them if
they are turned in." Mrs. Lees tries
to find the owner of every article
that is turned in. If it has any iden
tification on it, she writes a card to
the owner informing him that it is
in lost and found.
Many Articles Not Claimed
However, many articles have no
identification on them at all and it
is almost impossible to find the own
er. Many of the articles are never

claimed.
There is no definite length of time
that the articles remain in the lost
and found. Eventually the un
claimed articles are given away or
sold, however. Six months ago the
Purchasing Agent took some of the
things, sold some of the jewelry
for its gold value, and donated the
money to the Con Home or the Dean
of Men's office fund.
Clothing for Con Home
Nearly all clothing goes to the
Con Home and the Bookstore takes
all the unclaimed books. The pro
ceeds from articles that are sold go
to different campus funds.
The lost and found has been in
the Cashier's office for many years.
Some of the large universities have
definite lost and found offices with
people in charge as full-time em
ployment. It has never been neces
sary to do this at Stanford, how
ever.
Hours Open
Lost and found is open from 8:30
to 12 a.m. and from 1 to 4:30 p.m. on
week days. Mrs. Josephine McCar
thy, assistant cashier, helps Mrs.
Lees with it. "When I first came to
Stanford a year the articles
were scattered all over the Cash
ier's office," Mrs. Lees said. "Since
then I have straightened things up
and put them all in one corner and
have also put things in boxes and
labeled them."
Before coming to Stanford Mrs.
Lees worked in the accounts payable
office for the Paraffine Company in
San Francisco. She lives in Palo
Alto.
False Teeth Found
"I get a big kick out of doing the
lost and found work," she said.
"One time a pair of false teeth came
in. A woman had lost them at the
Memorial Theater where they had
fallen out of her pocket."
"There have been more lost ar
ticles in the winter because there are
more gloves and things to lose," she
said. "I think if the kids' heads were
not fastened on, they'd lose them
too."

all the unclaimed books. The pro
ceeds from articles that are sold go
to different campus funds.
The lost and found has been in
the Cashier's office for many years.
Some of the large universities have
definite lost and found offices with
people in charge as full-time em
ployment. It has never been neces
sary to do this at Stanford, how
ever.
Hours Open
Lost and found is open from 8:30
to 12 a.m. and from 1 to 4:30 p.m. on
week days. Mrs. Josephine McCar
thy, assistant cashier, helps Mrs.
Lees with it. "When I first came to
Stanford a year the articles
were scattered all over the Cash
ier's office," Mrs. Lees said. "Since
then I have straightened things up
and put them all in one corner and
have also put things in boxes and
labeled them."
Before coming to Stanford Mrs.
Lees worked in the accounts payable
office for the Paraffine Company in
San Francisco. She lives in Palo
Alto.
False Teeth Found
"I get a big kick out of doing the
lost and found work," she said.
"One time a pair of false teeth came
in. A woman had lost them at the
Memorial Theater where they had
fallen out of her pocket."
"There have been more lost ar
ticles in the winter because there are
more gloves and things to lose," she
said. "I think if the kids' heads were
not fastened on, they'd lose them
too."
As a side-line to hei* job as head
cashier, Mrs. Helen Lees is also in
charge of the lost and found depart
ment which is located in one corner
of the Cashier's office on the second
floor of the Ad Building.
All the departments of the school,
including the Police Department and
the Memorial Theater, turn in any
thing they find to this department.
There is always a large conglomera
tion of articles that have not been
claimed. Such things as coats, sweat
ers, gloves, caps, jewelry, fountain
pens, and even shoes are in the
collection.
Wooden Shoes Lost
"One girl left a pair of wooden
shoes in gym and they remained
here in the lost and found for sev
eral months before they were finally
claimed," Mrs. Lees said.
"Every day I get calls from peo
ple who have lost things that they
hope may be turned in," she said. "I
always keep a list and call them if
they are turned in." Mrs. Lees tries
to find the owner of every article
that is turned in. If it has any iden
tification on it, she writes a card to
the owner informing him that it is
in lost and found.
Many Articles Not Claimed
However, many articles have no
identification on them at all and it
is almost impossible to find the own
er. Many of the articles are never

claimed.
There is no definite length of time
that the articles remain in the lost
and found. Eventually the un
claimed articles are given away or
sold, however. Six months ago the
Purchasing Agent took some of the
things, sold some of the jewelry
for its gold value, and donated the
money to the Con Home or the Dean
of Men's office fund.
Clothing for Con Home
Nearly all clothing goes to the
Con Home and the Bookstore takes
all the unclaimed books. The pro
ceeds from articles that are sold go
to different campus funds.
