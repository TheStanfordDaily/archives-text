# Social Code Change Gets Excom OK
## 
### 
The proposal that social regula
tions be placed under the Funda
mental Standard, rather than under
Honor Code, in the revision of the
Constitution now being drafted by
Bill Gilbert and committee was
unanimously approved by Excom in
its meeting last night.
Whereas the by-laws of the 1942
constitution, inoperative since 1943,
state specifically that women's social
regulations shall be enforced by the
Honor Code, the new ruling would
make violations of these regulations
subject to discipline under Coun
cil interpretation of the Standard i
alone.
Postponement of the spring quar- |
ter election date from April 25 to |
May 16 was judged necessary in
order to provide for smooth running
of the proposed election schedule,
and to allow time for designation of
living-group areas and the machin
ery for election under the new plan
of representation.
Election of a non-area member on
Excom was approved, since the in
decision confronting freshman stu
dents in particular as to where they
will live fall quarter would disen
franchise them at the polls in May,
according to the provisions of the
area method. With the housing pro
gram speeded up, as it will be next
year, it is believed that this provi
sion may be hereafter eliminated.
An election assembly for intro
duction of candidates was deemed
essential to the processes of student
government, however small the
turnout. It is through the interest of
those that attend election assemblies
and later vote on the basis of them,
said A.S.S.U. president Barbara
White, that student government de
rives its value. Number of voters
participating in the referendum
showed an upward swing in student j
interest, she said, taking into ac- ]
count hours the polls were open.
