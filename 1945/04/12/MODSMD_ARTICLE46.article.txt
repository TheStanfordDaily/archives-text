# Campus Scout Troop Active In War Work
## 
### GILBERT WHEAT 
Stanford resembles a miniature
city with its own post office, fire de
partment, barber shop, and newspa
per, and its "citizens" are constantly
discovering little parts of it that most
of them never knew even existed.
A matter of interest to Stanford
students and especially former
Scouts, should be the fact that there
is a £cout troop right here on the
campus, with a meeting hall on Sal
vatierra Street (a building originally
built as a school for the children of
Stanford laculty members, but taken
over by the Scouts since a new
school has been built). The troop has
been in existence for about 23 years,
and at the present time its scout
master is Gordon Davis, Chief of Po
lice. Jim Emerson is assistant scout
master.
Active in War Work
"Gordy," in talking of his troop,
first referred specifically to its ac
tive participation in the war effort.
Since General Eisenhower has issued
a call for 300,000,000 tons of scrap
paper, his troop of 33 boys, ranging
in ages from 12 to 17, has collected
over 9,000 pounds. Gordy said that
those boys who had gathered up a
thousand pounds or, more apiece
would be given a special medal
known as the General Eisenhower
award.
Troop members who will receive
the award are John Hanna, Bill and
John Hardesty, Austin Turner, Ste
ven Hopkins, Dick Peterson, Robert
Demson, John Mcßain, and Gerald
Ber reman.
Proud of Troop
Gordy is proud of his troop and
has a right to be. This paper collec
tion represents hard work; the whole
collection is bundled and ready for
shipment to the paper warehouse in
San Jose, and cash received from
this paper will be used to finance
various activities and to purchase
supplies for the troop.

"This paper drive is just one of
I several efforts these Scouts have ta-J
| ken part in since Pearl Harbor; they [
| have been energetic in salvage cam- ;
! paigns and served faithfully as mes
! sengers during the blackouts we used
I to Jiave," Gordy said.
| Five Awards Given
He mentioned the fact that at the j
last court of honor in Palo Alto, five
boys received their Eagle Scout
awards. Gordy stated that "This rec
! ord of advancement has never been
duplicated by any other troop in this
! council since members of Troop 51
j here at Stanford earned a similar
j distinction about five years ago, j
j when five other boys received the I
Eagle Scout award."
Gordy remarked that the difficulty !
of obtaining the rank of Eagle Scout j
had increased since the war, because
of the impossibility at times of com- [
pleting the outdoor requirements, j
But the council was presented with i
a gift of ten acres of camp ground on
Huntington Lake, 75 miles east of ,
Fresno, by Aunt Lucy Stearns, who
was also responsible for financing the j
Civic Center in Palo Alto. A Scout j
camp, called 01-Ja-To, was set up,
where opportunities are presented
for obtaining merit badges like [
swimming, canoeing, and pioneering. |

of them never knew even existed.
A matter of interest to Stanford
students and especially former
Scouts, should be the fact that there
is a £cout troop right here on the
campus, with a meeting hall on Sal
vatierra Street (a building originally
built as a school for the children of
Stanford laculty members, but taken
over by the Scouts since a new
school has been built). The troop has
been in existence for about 23 years,
and at the present time its scout
master is Gordon Davis, Chief of Po
lice. Jim Emerson is assistant scout
master.
Active in War Work
"Gordy," in talking of his troop,
first referred specifically to its ac
tive participation in the war effort.
Since General Eisenhower has issued
a call for 300,000,000 tons of scrap
paper, his troop of 33 boys, ranging
in ages from 12 to 17, has collected
over 9,000 pounds. Gordy said that
those boys who had gathered up a
thousand pounds or, more apiece
would be given a special medal
known as the General Eisenhower
award.
Troop members who will receive
the award are John Hanna, Bill and
John Hardesty, Austin Turner, Ste
ven Hopkins, Dick Peterson, Robert
Demson, John Mcßain, and Gerald
Ber reman.
Proud of Troop
Gordy is proud of his troop and
has a right to be. This paper collec
tion represents hard work; the whole
collection is bundled and ready for
shipment to the paper warehouse in
San Jose, and cash received from
this paper will be used to finance
various activities and to purchase
supplies for the troop.

"This paper drive is just one of
I several efforts these Scouts have ta-J
| ken part in since Pearl Harbor; they [
| have been energetic in salvage cam- ;
! paigns and served faithfully as mes
! sengers during the blackouts we used
I to Jiave," Gordy said.
| Five Awards Given
He mentioned the fact that at the j
last court of honor in Palo Alto, five
boys received their Eagle Scout
awards. Gordy stated that "This rec
! ord of advancement has never been
duplicated by any other troop in this
! council since members of Troop 51
j here at Stanford earned a similar
j distinction about five years ago, j
j when five other boys received the I
Eagle Scout award."
Gordy remarked that the difficulty !
of obtaining the rank of Eagle Scout j
had increased since the war, because
of the impossibility at times of com- [
pleting the outdoor requirements, j
But the council was presented with i
a gift of ten acres of camp ground on
Huntington Lake, 75 miles east of ,
Fresno, by Aunt Lucy Stearns, who
was also responsible for financing the j
Civic Center in Palo Alto. A Scout j
camp, called 01-Ja-To, was set up,
where opportunities are presented
for obtaining merit badges like [
swimming, canoeing, and pioneering. |
Stanford resembles a miniature
city with its own post office, fire de
partment, barber shop, and newspa
per, and its "citizens" are constantly
discovering little parts of it that most
of them never knew even existed.
