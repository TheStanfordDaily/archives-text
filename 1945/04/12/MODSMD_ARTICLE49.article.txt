# Tuesday Series Has Long History, Many Slips, Say Robinson, Heffner
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
"Two theories have always been j
the basis on which the Tuesday Eve- |
ning Series progiams have been cho- |
sen, and they are the distribution !
of subject matter and the policy of
having student advisors," said Ed«ar
Eugene Robinson, professor of Am
erican history, and long time mem
ber and chairman of the Committee
of Public Exercises- which sponsors
the series, in an interview with the
Daily recently.

Isj the policy «»f distributing
subject matter, said Dr. Robinson,
the Series each inonlh tries to have
one lecture on science, one on lec
ture. art. or music; one on history
or the social sciences; and an eve
ning 011 public affairs or a movie.
"The Tuesday Series runs no
competition, because there is no
organization similar to it in this

region." Dr. Robinson said, "so that
by not specializing in subject mat
ter. it can present programs that
will appeal to almost everyone."
The second theory, that of seeking
.student advisors, was also emphasiz
ed by Hubert C. Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and present
chairman of the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises. "The Committee would
appreciate suggestions from faculty
members and students that wouh!
make the programs of greater ser
vice to the University," Said Mr.
Heffner, "but we especially want the
students' opinions."
The history of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series goes hack to the days
of David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, who or
ganized the Series to "share the
fine specialists on this campus and
their knowledge with the com
munity," said Mr. Heffner.
For many years Tuesday Series
programs were held only infre
quently, but by 1920 they were well
established among campus functions
and were part of the weekly doings
of Stanford life.
"The Committee of Public Ex
ercises is a faculty committee,"
explained Dr. Robinson, "and
planning the Tuesday Evening
Scries is only one of its functions.
It arranges all public activities,
including commencement. Found
ers' Day.and (he entertainment of
visitors, which is one of its most
important duties."
Tuesday Series programs used to
be held in the old Little Theater in
Room 100, he added; it was later
moved to the old Assembly Hall
which no longer exists. The latter
was torn down in 1937, was Mr. Hef

flier's explanation, and the School of
Business occupies that site now.
"Many times wo have been caught
in funny and frantic situations," said
Mr. Heffner, "One time when Laura
Bolton was due to arrive in San
Francisco early on the morning of
her lecture. She wired us that her
train was late and that she wouldn't
arrive until 3 in the afternoon. That
wasn't so bad, but when a second
telegram arived saying she wasn't
going to get in until 5, we were
frantic. We hurriedly lined up a "folk
music program, but Miss Bolton did
arrive—and only just before the
program was to start.
"A couple of years ago," lie con
tinued, "we had a music program
hooked for a Series performance.
The artist who was to give the
program was delayed, and only a
few hours before the program was
to start we found out he couldn't
come. Immediately we called Dr.
Warren D. Allen who gave an out
standing program 011 the harpis
chord with demonstrations.
"We couldn't do this if we did'nt
have a gifted, versatile, and coop
erative faculty body to help us
out," he added; "we always have
to be prepared for an emergency
a few hours in advance."
Not only is the Series designed to
bring to the campus outstanding
people who have something to con
tribute that we don't have, but it is
used also to share with the campus
and community the interesting work
our faculty members do that other
wise doesn't enter into the general
academic program, declared Mr.
Heffner. Many members of our fac
ulty are asked for various national
special services; they go to many
places, and when they return with
interesting stories to report we put
them on the Tuesday Series pro
grams, he explained.
Music and art occupy an im
portant position on the Tuesday
Series agenda, said Mr. Heffner.
Most of the musical programs arc
sponsored by the Friends of Mu
sic, a group of peninsula people,
headed this year by Mrs. Russell
Lee, who donate money for most
of the music programs.
In the summer, in cooperation
with the Elizabeth Sprague Cool
idge Music Foundation, they bring
a series of chamber music con
certs —from 4 to (i—of which 2 go
on the Tuesday Evening Series;
the rest are presented on other
evenings, Mr. Heffner said. "We
are deeply indebted to the Friends
of Music at Stanford for the series
of outstanding music programs we
couldn't have otherwise had," he
added.
Every year Dr. Tressider appoints
an administrative committee with its
powers established by the trustees
to help various organizations, de
partments, and schools to present
what they have to the campus com
munity in the best way possible,
said Mr. Heffner. This Committee of
Public Exercises has a budget set
up by which they are able to obtain
outside speakers in this region to
come to the campus.
It is a valuable educational ad
vantage, lie said, "Our biggest sup
port. comes from the community, but
in normal times people came from
all over this section of the penin
sula."
Fourteen faculty members com
prise the Committee of Public Ex
ercises for 1944-45. They arc Dr.
Warren I). Allen, University Or
-1 ganist; Thomas A. Bailey, profes
sor of history; Chilton R. Bush,
professor of journalism; Lorcn R.
Chandler, dean of the School of
Medicine; Paul 11. Davis, general
secretary of (he University; John
W. Dodds, dean of (he School of
Humanities; J'aul E Holdcn of the
Graduate School of Business;
George E. Osborne, professor of
law; Herbert Jan Popper, assistant
professor of music; Hugh 11. Skill
ing, acting dean of the School of
Engineering; F. Cowles Strickland,
associate professor of speech and
drama, on leave this quarter; V.
C. Twitty. professor of biology; C.
Langdon White, professor of geo
graphy; and Mr. Ileffner.
A sflb-committee of four meets
every Thursday noon to plan the

Tuesday Scries. They are Professor
Bush, Professor Strickland, Mr. Hef
fner, and Mrs. Yvonne H. Dane, sec
retary to the Committee on Public
Exercises. All Scries programs are
booked a quarter in advance, said
Mr. HelTner.
Dr. Robinson, who left the com
mittee in 1941, added some informa
tion on the history of past Series
programs and other activities of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
"Before the war," he said, "we had
a Wednesday afternoon scries which
was more highly specialized than the
Tuesday Series, and which was de
signed mainly for visiting scholars."
In the last lew years, he added, the
Tuesday Series sponsored several
symposiums. "We had half a dozen
on the war before the United States
entered, and they were very popu
lar. Others were given on current
subjects."
Dr. Robinson had several amus
ing incidents connected with the
early Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams to recount. "When they
were held in the old Little Thea
ter," he said, "it used to be my
job to carry a glass of water clear
across the Quad for the speaker's
use. For in those days the water
was turned off at night, and there
was no other way for the speaker
to have any."
When he was first put on the com
mittee, he said, he was in charge of
marking of! the department's places
on Quad in front of the Memorial
Church in preparation for Com
mencement Exercises "I was so ner
vous that I got down on Quad at 5
in the morning to begin marking off
their places. Of course I finished
long before Commencement was
scheduled to start, but by then it
was too late for me to get some of
the sleep I need not have missed.
And after all that, 1 found 1 had ar
ranged it so that the men entered
the church before the women!"
Another time, he said, a Tuesday
Series chairman invited a man to
come down to be speaker for the
evening. He took Itini to his house
for dinner, after which they walked
down Quad to the Little Theater
where the speaker was scheduled to
appear. But the door was locked,
the place was dark, and no one was
there. It wasn't until then that the
chairman realized that he had for
gotten to give the speaker any ad
vance publicity!
Students themselves have contrib
uted to Tuesday Series programs in
past years. Telford Work, Navy Med
student whose picture "Trail Pack
ing in the Trinity Alps" was a recent
program, filmed another picture,
"The Eagle," several years ago and
brought it to the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises as a possible program
subject. "We liked it," Said Dr. Rob
inson, "and as a Series program it
proved very popular."
He told of another time several
years ago when some Stanford stud
ents took an around-thc-world trip.
When they returned, 4 or 5 of them
gave a report on the journey at a
Tuesday Evening Scries program.
When the Scries first started, said
Dr. Robinson, average attendance
was about 75 to 100 people a night;
in the academic year 1940-41 32,000
people comprised the total Scries
audience.
The Scries programs give an in
teresting clue to current history.
In 1921-22, the year of the Wash
ington Conference, nearly onc
fifth of the programs dealt with
some phase of the Far East, a re
gion which figured prominently in
( onfcrcncc plans. Three lectures
in succession were given on the
conference, including one by form
er Stanford Professor Yamato
Ichihashi, who was a member of
the staff of the Japanese delega
tion to the conference.
In 1933-34, the first year of the
Roosevelt administration, there were
a couple of lectures on the new gov
ernment. The only program which
reflected the coming menace to the
democratic nations was a lecture by
Sir Norman Angcll on "The Crisis
in Democracy: Ways Out."
In 1935-30 a series of four lec
tures and recitals on Richard Wag
ner and"The Ring" were present
ed. The approaching crisis in Eur

ope and the Far East was shown
by the fact that 8 out of a total of
27 subjects were devoted to lec
tures on different phases of this
vital subject.
The first year of war for the
United Stated, 1941-42, showed a
drop of some 5,000 from the previous
year's attendance; "but," explained
the President's annual report for
that year, "this was due in part to
blackouts and restrictions on tires."
It added that in the 5 years preced
ing, Series programs had drawn
133,233 listeners.
Some of the famous speakers
who have appeared on the Tues
day Evening Series arc William
Rose Benct, Kcrmit Roosevelt, Roy
W. Howard, Louis Adamic, Lewis
Mumford, C. S. Forester, Villijal
mur Stefansson, and llu Shih.
Sorry, this last is China's am
bassador to the United States, not
the real live model for Milt Caniff's
character.

on the war before the United States
entered, and they were very popu
lar. Others were given on current
subjects."
Dr. Robinson had several amus
ing incidents connected with the
early Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams to recount. "When they
were held in the old Little Thea
ter," he said, "it used to be my
job to carry a glass of water clear
across the Quad for the speaker's
use. For in those days the water
was turned off at night, and there
was no other way for the speaker
to have any."
When he was first put on the com
mittee, he said, he was in charge of
marking of! the department's places
on Quad in front of the Memorial
Church in preparation for Com
mencement Exercises "I was so ner
vous that I got down on Quad at 5
in the morning to begin marking off
their places. Of course I finished
long before Commencement was
scheduled to start, but by then it
was too late for me to get some of
the sleep I need not have missed.
And after all that, 1 found 1 had ar
ranged it so that the men entered
the church before the women!"
Another time, he said, a Tuesday
Series chairman invited a man to
come down to be speaker for the
evening. He took Itini to his house
for dinner, after which they walked
down Quad to the Little Theater
where the speaker was scheduled to
appear. But the door was locked,
the place was dark, and no one was
there. It wasn't until then that the
chairman realized that he had for
gotten to give the speaker any ad
vance publicity!
Students themselves have contrib
uted to Tuesday Series programs in
past years. Telford Work, Navy Med
student whose picture "Trail Pack
ing in the Trinity Alps" was a recent
program, filmed another picture,
"The Eagle," several years ago and
brought it to the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises as a possible program
subject. "We liked it," Said Dr. Rob
inson, "and as a Series program it
proved very popular."
He told of another time several
years ago when some Stanford stud
ents took an around-thc-world trip.
When they returned, 4 or 5 of them
gave a report on the journey at a
Tuesday Evening Scries program.
When the Scries first started, said
Dr. Robinson, average attendance
was about 75 to 100 people a night;
in the academic year 1940-41 32,000
people comprised the total Scries
audience.
The Scries programs give an in
teresting clue to current history.
In 1921-22, the year of the Wash
ington Conference, nearly onc
fifth of the programs dealt with
some phase of the Far East, a re
gion which figured prominently in
( onfcrcncc plans. Three lectures
in succession were given on the
conference, including one by form
er Stanford Professor Yamato
Ichihashi, who was a member of
the staff of the Japanese delega
tion to the conference.
In 1933-34, the first year of the
Roosevelt administration, there were
a couple of lectures on the new gov
ernment. The only program which
reflected the coming menace to the
democratic nations was a lecture by
Sir Norman Angcll on "The Crisis
in Democracy: Ways Out."
In 1935-30 a series of four lec
tures and recitals on Richard Wag
ner and"The Ring" were present
ed. The approaching crisis in Eur

ope and the Far East was shown
by the fact that 8 out of a total of
27 subjects were devoted to lec
tures on different phases of this
vital subject.
The first year of war for the
United Stated, 1941-42, showed a
drop of some 5,000 from the previous
year's attendance; "but," explained
the President's annual report for
that year, "this was due in part to
blackouts and restrictions on tires."
It added that in the 5 years preced

133,233 listeners.

EDGAR EUGENE ROBINSON.
Professor of American History.

This Filipino, having hatJ the mis
fortune to full into Jap hands, was
found dead, resting on a fallen
bpanish iron gate, inside Manila's
walled city.
"Two theories have always been j
the basis on which the Tuesday Eve- |
ning Series progiams have been cho- |
sen, and they are the distribution !
of subject matter and the policy of
having student advisors," said Ed«ar
Eugene Robinson, professor of Am
erican history, and long time mem
ber and chairman of the Committee
of Public Exercises- which sponsors
the series, in an interview with the
Daily recently.

Isj the policy «»f distributing
subject matter, said Dr. Robinson,
the Series each inonlh tries to have
one lecture on science, one on lec
ture. art. or music; one on history
or the social sciences; and an eve
ning 011 public affairs or a movie.
"The Tuesday Series runs no
competition, because there is no
organization similar to it in this

region." Dr. Robinson said, "so that
by not specializing in subject mat
ter. it can present programs that
will appeal to almost everyone."
The second theory, that of seeking
.student advisors, was also emphasiz
ed by Hubert C. Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and present
chairman of the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises. "The Committee would
appreciate suggestions from faculty
members and students that wouh!
make the programs of greater ser
vice to the University," Said Mr.
Heffner, "but we especially want the
students' opinions."
The history of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series goes hack to the days
of David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, who or
ganized the Series to "share the
fine specialists on this campus and
their knowledge with the com
munity," said Mr. Heffner.
For many years Tuesday Series
programs were held only infre
quently, but by 1920 they were well
established among campus functions
and were part of the weekly doings
of Stanford life.
"The Committee of Public Ex
ercises is a faculty committee,"
explained Dr. Robinson, "and
planning the Tuesday Evening
Scries is only one of its functions.
It arranges all public activities,
including commencement. Found
ers' Day.and (he entertainment of
visitors, which is one of its most
important duties."
Tuesday Series programs used to
be held in the old Little Theater in
Room 100, he added; it was later
moved to the old Assembly Hall
which no longer exists. The latter
was torn down in 1937, was Mr. Hef

flier's explanation, and the School of
Business occupies that site now.
"Many times wo have been caught
in funny and frantic situations," said
Mr. Heffner, "One time when Laura
Bolton was due to arrive in San
Francisco early on the morning of
her lecture. She wired us that her
train was late and that she wouldn't
arrive until 3 in the afternoon. That
wasn't so bad, but when a second
telegram arived saying she wasn't
going to get in until 5, we were
frantic. We hurriedly lined up a "folk
music program, but Miss Bolton did
arrive—and only just before the
program was to start.
"A couple of years ago," lie con
tinued, "we had a music program
hooked for a Series performance.
The artist who was to give the
program was delayed, and only a
few hours before the program was
to start we found out he couldn't
come. Immediately we called Dr.
Warren D. Allen who gave an out
standing program 011 the harpis
chord with demonstrations.
"We couldn't do this if we did'nt
have a gifted, versatile, and coop
erative faculty body to help us
out," he added; "we always have
to be prepared for an emergency
a few hours in advance."
Not only is the Series designed to
bring to the campus outstanding
people who have something to con
tribute that we don't have, but it is
used also to share with the campus
and community the interesting work
our faculty members do that other
wise doesn't enter into the general
academic program, declared Mr.
Heffner. Many members of our fac
ulty are asked for various national
special services; they go to many
places, and when they return with
interesting stories to report we put
them on the Tuesday Series pro
grams, he explained.
Music and art occupy an im
portant position on the Tuesday
Series agenda, said Mr. Heffner.
Most of the musical programs arc
sponsored by the Friends of Mu
sic, a group of peninsula people,
headed this year by Mrs. Russell
Lee, who donate money for most
of the music programs.
In the summer, in cooperation
with the Elizabeth Sprague Cool
idge Music Foundation, they bring
a series of chamber music con
certs —from 4 to (i—of which 2 go
on the Tuesday Evening Series;
the rest are presented on other
evenings, Mr. Heffner said. "We
are deeply indebted to the Friends
of Music at Stanford for the series
of outstanding music programs we
couldn't have otherwise had," he
added.
Every year Dr. Tressider appoints
an administrative committee with its
powers established by the trustees
to help various organizations, de
partments, and schools to present
what they have to the campus com
munity in the best way possible,
said Mr. Heffner. This Committee of
Public Exercises has a budget set
up by which they are able to obtain
outside speakers in this region to
come to the campus.
It is a valuable educational ad
vantage, lie said, "Our biggest sup
port. comes from the community, but
in normal times people came from
all over this section of the penin
sula."
Fourteen faculty members com
prise the Committee of Public Ex
ercises for 1944-45. They arc Dr.
Warren I). Allen, University Or
-1 ganist; Thomas A. Bailey, profes
sor of history; Chilton R. Bush,
professor of journalism; Lorcn R.
Chandler, dean of the School of
Medicine; Paul 11. Davis, general
secretary of (he University; John
W. Dodds, dean of (he School of
Humanities; J'aul E Holdcn of the
Graduate School of Business;
George E. Osborne, professor of
law; Herbert Jan Popper, assistant
professor of music; Hugh 11. Skill
ing, acting dean of the School of
Engineering; F. Cowles Strickland,
associate professor of speech and
drama, on leave this quarter; V.
C. Twitty. professor of biology; C.
Langdon White, professor of geo
graphy; and Mr. Ileffner.
A sflb-committee of four meets
every Thursday noon to plan the

Tuesday Scries. They are Professor
Bush, Professor Strickland, Mr. Hef
fner, and Mrs. Yvonne H. Dane, sec
retary to the Committee on Public
Exercises. All Scries programs are
booked a quarter in advance, said
Mr. HelTner.
Dr. Robinson, who left the com
mittee in 1941, added some informa
tion on the history of past Series
programs and other activities of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
"Before the war," he said, "we had
a Wednesday afternoon scries which
was more highly specialized than the
Tuesday Series, and which was de
signed mainly for visiting scholars."
In the last lew years, he added, the
Tuesday Series sponsored several
symposiums. "We had half a dozen
on the war before the United States
entered, and they were very popu
lar. Others were given on current
subjects."
Dr. Robinson had several amus
ing incidents connected with the
early Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams to recount. "When they
were held in the old Little Thea

A sflb-committee of four meets
every Thursday noon to plan the

Tuesday Scries. They are Professor
Bush, Professor Strickland, Mr. Hef
fner, and Mrs. Yvonne H. Dane, sec
retary to the Committee on Public
Exercises. All Scries programs are
booked a quarter in advance, said
Mr. HelTner.
Dr. Robinson, who left the com
mittee in 1941, added some informa
tion on the history of past Series
programs and other activities of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
"Before the war," he said, "we had
a Wednesday afternoon scries which
was more highly specialized than the
Tuesday Series, and which was de
signed mainly for visiting scholars."
In the last lew years, he added, the
Tuesday Series sponsored several
symposiums. "We had half a dozen
on the war before the United States
entered, and they were very popu
lar. Others were given on current
subjects."
Dr. Robinson had several amus
ing incidents connected with the
early Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams to recount. "When they
were held in the old Little Thea
ter," he said, "it used to be my
job to carry a glass of water clear
across the Quad for the speaker's
use. For in those days the water
was turned off at night, and there
was no other way for the speaker
to have any."
When he was first put on the com
mittee, he said, he was in charge of
marking of! the department's places
on Quad in front of the Memorial
Church in preparation for Com
mencement Exercises "I was so ner
vous that I got down on Quad at 5
in the morning to begin marking off
their places. Of course I finished
long before Commencement was
scheduled to start, but by then it
was too late for me to get some of
the sleep I need not have missed.
And after all that, 1 found 1 had ar
ranged it so that the men entered
the church before the women!"
Another time, he said, a Tuesday
Series chairman invited a man to
come down to be speaker for the
evening. He took Itini to his house
for dinner, after which they walked
down Quad to the Little Theater
where the speaker was scheduled to
appear. But the door was locked,
the place was dark, and no one was
there. It wasn't until then that the
chairman realized that he had for
gotten to give the speaker any ad
vance publicity!
Students themselves have contrib
uted to Tuesday Series programs in
past years. Telford Work, Navy Med
student whose picture "Trail Pack
ing in the Trinity Alps" was a recent
program, filmed another picture,
"The Eagle," several years ago and
brought it to the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises as a possible program
subject. "We liked it," Said Dr. Rob
inson, "and as a Series program it
proved very popular."
He told of another time several
years ago when some Stanford stud
ents took an around-thc-world trip.
When they returned, 4 or 5 of them
gave a report on the journey at a
Tuesday Evening Scries program.
When the Scries first started, said
Dr. Robinson, average attendance
was about 75 to 100 people a night;
in the academic year 1940-41 32,000
people comprised the total Scries
audience.
The Scries programs give an in
teresting clue to current history.
In 1921-22, the year of the Wash
ington Conference, nearly onc
fifth of the programs dealt with
some phase of the Far East, a re
gion which figured prominently in
( onfcrcncc plans. Three lectures
in succession were given on the
conference, including one by form
er Stanford Professor Yamato
Ichihashi, who was a member of
the staff of the Japanese delega
tion to the conference.
In 1933-34, the first year of the
Roosevelt administration, there were
a couple of lectures on the new gov
ernment. The only program which
reflected the coming menace to the
democratic nations was a lecture by
Sir Norman Angcll on "The Crisis
in Democracy: Ways Out."
In 1935-30 a series of four lec
tures and recitals on Richard Wag
ner and"The Ring" were present
ed. The approaching crisis in Eur

ope and the Far East was shown
by the fact that 8 out of a total of
27 subjects were devoted to lec
tures on different phases of this
vital subject.
The first year of war for the
United Stated, 1941-42, showed a
drop of some 5,000 from the previous
year's attendance; "but," explained
the President's annual report for
that year, "this was due in part to
blackouts and restrictions on tires."
It added that in the 5 years preced
ing, Series programs had drawn
133,233 listeners.
Some of the famous speakers
who have appeared on the Tues
day Evening Series arc William
Rose Benct, Kcrmit Roosevelt, Roy
W. Howard, Louis Adamic, Lewis
Mumford, C. S. Forester, Villijal
mur Stefansson, and llu Shih.

Professor of American History.

This Filipino, having hatJ the mis
fortune to full into Jap hands, was
found dead, resting on a fallen
bpanish iron gate, inside Manila's
walled city.
"Two theories have always been j
the basis on which the Tuesday Eve- |
ning Series progiams have been cho- |
sen, and they are the distribution !
of subject matter and the policy of
having student advisors," said Ed«ar
Eugene Robinson, professor of Am
erican history, and long time mem
ber and chairman of the Committee
of Public Exercises- which sponsors
the series, in an interview with the
Daily recently.

Isj the policy «»f distributing
subject matter, said Dr. Robinson,
the Series each inonlh tries to have
one lecture on science, one on lec
ture. art. or music; one on history
or the social sciences; and an eve
ning 011 public affairs or a movie.
"The Tuesday Series runs no
competition, because there is no
organization similar to it in this

region." Dr. Robinson said, "so that
by not specializing in subject mat
ter. it can present programs that
will appeal to almost everyone."
The second theory, that of seeking
.student advisors, was also emphasiz
ed by Hubert C. Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and present
chairman of the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises. "The Committee would
appreciate suggestions from faculty
members and students that wouh!
make the programs of greater ser
vice to the University," Said Mr.
Heffner, "but we especially want the
students' opinions."
The history of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series goes hack to the days
of David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, who or
ganized the Series to "share the
fine specialists on this campus and
their knowledge with the com
munity," said Mr. Heffner.
For many years Tuesday Series
programs were held only infre
quently, but by 1920 they were well
established among campus functions
and were part of the weekly doings
of Stanford life.
"The Committee of Public Ex
ercises is a faculty committee,"
explained Dr. Robinson, "and
planning the Tuesday Evening
Scries is only one of its functions.
It arranges all public activities,
including commencement. Found
ers' Day.and (he entertainment of
visitors, which is one of its most
important duties."
Tuesday Series programs used to
be held in the old Little Theater in
Room 100, he added; it was later
moved to the old Assembly Hall
which no longer exists. The latter
was torn down in 1937, was Mr. Hef

flier's explanation, and the School of
Business occupies that site now.
"Many times wo have been caught
in funny and frantic situations," said
Mr. Heffner, "One time when Laura
Bolton was due to arrive in San
Francisco early on the morning of
her lecture. She wired us that her
train was late and that she wouldn't
arrive until 3 in the afternoon. That
wasn't so bad, but when a second

The artist who was to give the
program was delayed, and only a
few hours before the program was

Warren D. Allen who gave an out
standing program 011 the harpis
chord with demonstrations.
"We couldn't do this if we did'nt

Professor of American History.

This Filipino, having hatJ the mis
fortune to full into Jap hands, was
found dead, resting on a fallen
bpanish iron gate, inside Manila's
walled city.
"Two theories have always been j
the basis on which the Tuesday Eve- |
ning Series progiams have been cho- |
sen, and they are the distribution !
of subject matter and the policy of
having student advisors," said Ed«ar
Eugene Robinson, professor of Am
erican history, and long time mem
ber and chairman of the Committee
of Public Exercises- which sponsors
the series, in an interview with the
Daily recently.

Isj the policy «»f distributing
subject matter, said Dr. Robinson,
the Series each inonlh tries to have
one lecture on science, one on lec
ture. art. or music; one on history
or the social sciences; and an eve
ning 011 public affairs or a movie.
"The Tuesday Series runs no
competition, because there is no
organization similar to it in this

region." Dr. Robinson said, "so that
by not specializing in subject mat
ter. it can present programs that
will appeal to almost everyone."
The second theory, that of seeking
.student advisors, was also emphasiz
ed by Hubert C. Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and present
chairman of the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises. "The Committee would
appreciate suggestions from faculty
members and students that wouh!
make the programs of greater ser
vice to the University," Said Mr.
Heffner, "but we especially want the
students' opinions."
The history of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series goes hack to the days
of David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, who or
ganized the Series to "share the
fine specialists on this campus and
their knowledge with the com
munity," said Mr. Heffner.
For many years Tuesday Series
programs were held only infre
quently, but by 1920 they were well
established among campus functions
and were part of the weekly doings
of Stanford life.
"The Committee of Public Ex
ercises is a faculty committee,"
explained Dr. Robinson, "and
planning the Tuesday Evening
Scries is only one of its functions.
It arranges all public activities,
including commencement. Found
ers' Day.and (he entertainment of
visitors, which is one of its most
important duties."
Tuesday Series programs used to
be held in the old Little Theater in
Room 100, he added; it was later
moved to the old Assembly Hall
which no longer exists. The latter
was torn down in 1937, was Mr. Hef

flier's explanation, and the School of
Business occupies that site now.
"Many times wo have been caught
in funny and frantic situations," said
Mr. Heffner, "One time when Laura
Bolton was due to arrive in San
Francisco early on the morning of
her lecture. She wired us that her
train was late and that she wouldn't
arrive until 3 in the afternoon. That
wasn't so bad, but when a second
telegram arived saying she wasn't
going to get in until 5, we were
frantic. We hurriedly lined up a "folk
music program, but Miss Bolton did
arrive—and only just before the
program was to start.
"A couple of years ago," lie con
tinued, "we had a music program
hooked for a Series performance.
The artist who was to give the
program was delayed, and only a
few hours before the program was
to start we found out he couldn't
come. Immediately we called Dr.
Warren D. Allen who gave an out
standing program 011 the harpis
chord with demonstrations.
"We couldn't do this if we did'nt
have a gifted, versatile, and coop
erative faculty body to help us
out," he added; "we always have
to be prepared for an emergency
a few hours in advance."
Not only is the Series designed to
bring to the campus outstanding
people who have something to con
tribute that we don't have, but it is
used also to share with the campus
and community the interesting work
our faculty members do that other
wise doesn't enter into the general
academic program, declared Mr.
Heffner. Many members of our fac
ulty are asked for various national
special services; they go to many
places, and when they return with
interesting stories to report we put
them on the Tuesday Series pro
grams, he explained.
Music and art occupy an im
portant position on the Tuesday
Series agenda, said Mr. Heffner.
Most of the musical programs arc
sponsored by the Friends of Mu
sic, a group of peninsula people,
headed this year by Mrs. Russell
Lee, who donate money for most
of the music programs.
In the summer, in cooperation
with the Elizabeth Sprague Cool
idge Music Foundation, they bring
a series of chamber music con
certs —from 4 to (i—of which 2 go
on the Tuesday Evening Series;
the rest are presented on other
evenings, Mr. Heffner said. "We
are deeply indebted to the Friends
of Music at Stanford for the series
of outstanding music programs we
couldn't have otherwise had," he
added.
Every year Dr. Tressider appoints
an administrative committee with its
powers established by the trustees
to help various organizations, de
partments, and schools to present
what they have to the campus com
munity in the best way possible,
said Mr. Heffner. This Committee of
Public Exercises has a budget set
up by which they are able to obtain
outside speakers in this region to
come to the campus.
It is a valuable educational ad
vantage, lie said, "Our biggest sup
port. comes from the community, but
in normal times people came from
all over this section of the penin
sula."
Fourteen faculty members com
prise the Committee of Public Ex
ercises for 1944-45. They arc Dr.
Warren I). Allen, University Or
-1 ganist; Thomas A. Bailey, profes
sor of history; Chilton R. Bush,
professor of journalism; Lorcn R.
Chandler, dean of the School of
Medicine; Paul 11. Davis, general
secretary of (he University; John
W. Dodds, dean of (he School of
Humanities; J'aul E Holdcn of the
Graduate School of Business;
George E. Osborne, professor of
law; Herbert Jan Popper, assistant
professor of music; Hugh 11. Skill
ing, acting dean of the School of
Engineering; F. Cowles Strickland,
associate professor of speech and
drama, on leave this quarter; V.
C. Twitty. professor of biology; C.
Langdon White, professor of geo
graphy; and Mr. Ileffner.
A sflb-committee of four meets
every Thursday noon to plan the

Tuesday Scries. They are Professor
Bush, Professor Strickland, Mr. Hef
fner, and Mrs. Yvonne H. Dane, sec
retary to the Committee on Public
Exercises. All Scries programs are
booked a quarter in advance, said
Mr. HelTner.
Dr. Robinson, who left the com
mittee in 1941, added some informa
tion on the history of past Series
programs and other activities of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
"Before the war," he said, "we had
a Wednesday afternoon scries which
was more highly specialized than the
Tuesday Series, and which was de
signed mainly for visiting scholars."
In the last lew years, he added, the
Tuesday Series sponsored several
symposiums. "We had half a dozen
on the war before the United States
entered, and they were very popu
lar. Others were given on current
subjects."
Dr. Robinson had several amus
ing incidents connected with the
early Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams to recount. "When they
were held in the old Little Thea
ter," he said, "it used to be my
job to carry a glass of water clear
across the Quad for the speaker's
use. For in those days the water
was turned off at night, and there
was no other way for the speaker
to have any."
When he was first put on the com
mittee, he said, he was in charge of
marking of! the department's places
on Quad in front of the Memorial
Church in preparation for Com
mencement Exercises "I was so ner
vous that I got down on Quad at 5
in the morning to begin marking off
their places. Of course I finished
long before Commencement was
scheduled to start, but by then it
was too late for me to get some of
the sleep I need not have missed.
And after all that, 1 found 1 had ar
ranged it so that the men entered
the church before the women!"
Another time, he said, a Tuesday
Series chairman invited a man to
come down to be speaker for the
evening. He took Itini to his house
for dinner, after which they walked
down Quad to the Little Theater
where the speaker was scheduled to
appear. But the door was locked,
the place was dark, and no one was
there. It wasn't until then that the
chairman realized that he had for
gotten to give the speaker any ad
vance publicity!
Students themselves have contrib
uted to Tuesday Series programs in
past years. Telford Work, Navy Med
student whose picture "Trail Pack
ing in the Trinity Alps" was a recent
program, filmed another picture,
"The Eagle," several years ago and
brought it to the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises as a possible program
subject. "We liked it," Said Dr. Rob
inson, "and as a Series program it
proved very popular."
He told of another time several
years ago when some Stanford stud
ents took an around-thc-world trip.
When they returned, 4 or 5 of them
gave a report on the journey at a
Tuesday Evening Scries program.
When the Scries first started, said
Dr. Robinson, average attendance
was about 75 to 100 people a night;
in the academic year 1940-41 32,000
people comprised the total Scries
audience.
The Scries programs give an in
teresting clue to current history.
In 1921-22, the year of the Wash
ington Conference, nearly onc
fifth of the programs dealt with
some phase of the Far East, a re
gion which figured prominently in
( onfcrcncc plans. Three lectures

ernment. The only program which
reflected the coming menace to the
democratic nations was a lecture by
Sir Norman Angcll on "The Crisis

In 1935-30 a series of four lec

ope and the Far East was shown
by the fact that 8 out of a total of

said Mr. Heffner. This Committee of

Fourteen faculty members com

Langdon White, professor of geo
graphy; and Mr. Ileffner.
A sflb-committee of four meets
every Thursday noon to plan the

Tuesday Scries. They are Professor
Bush, Professor Strickland, Mr. Hef
fner, and Mrs. Yvonne H. Dane, sec
retary to the Committee on Public
Exercises. All Scries programs are
booked a quarter in advance, said
Mr. HelTner.
Dr. Robinson, who left the com
mittee in 1941, added some informa
tion on the history of past Series
programs and other activities of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
"Before the war," he said, "we had
a Wednesday afternoon scries which
was more highly specialized than the
Tuesday Series, and which was de
signed mainly for visiting scholars."
In the last lew years, he added, the
Tuesday Series sponsored several
symposiums. "We had half a dozen
on the war before the United States
entered, and they were very popu
lar. Others were given on current
subjects."
Dr. Robinson had several amus
ing incidents connected with the
early Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams to recount. "When they
were held in the old Little Thea
ter," he said, "it used to be my
job to carry a glass of water clear
across the Quad for the speaker's
use. For in those days the water
was turned off at night, and there
was no other way for the speaker
to have any."
When he was first put on the com
mittee, he said, he was in charge of
marking of! the department's places
on Quad in front of the Memorial
Church in preparation for Com
mencement Exercises "I was so ner
vous that I got down on Quad at 5
in the morning to begin marking off
their places. Of course I finished
long before Commencement was
scheduled to start, but by then it
was too late for me to get some of
the sleep I need not have missed.
And after all that, 1 found 1 had ar
ranged it so that the men entered
the church before the women!"
Another time, he said, a Tuesday
Series chairman invited a man to
come down to be speaker for the
evening. He took Itini to his house
for dinner, after which they walked
down Quad to the Little Theater
where the speaker was scheduled to
appear. But the door was locked,
the place was dark, and no one was
there. It wasn't until then that the
chairman realized that he had for
gotten to give the speaker any ad
vance publicity!
Students themselves have contrib
uted to Tuesday Series programs in
past years. Telford Work, Navy Med
student whose picture "Trail Pack
ing in the Trinity Alps" was a recent
program, filmed another picture,
"The Eagle," several years ago and
brought it to the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises as a possible program
subject. "We liked it," Said Dr. Rob
inson, "and as a Series program it
proved very popular."
He told of another time several
years ago when some Stanford stud
ents took an around-thc-world trip.
When they returned, 4 or 5 of them
gave a report on the journey at a
Tuesday Evening Scries program.
When the Scries first started, said
Dr. Robinson, average attendance
was about 75 to 100 people a night;
in the academic year 1940-41 32,000
people comprised the total Scries
audience.
The Scries programs give an in
teresting clue to current history.
In 1921-22, the year of the Wash
ington Conference, nearly onc
fifth of the programs dealt with
some phase of the Far East, a re
gion which figured prominently in
( onfcrcncc plans. Three lectures
in succession were given on the
conference, including one by form
er Stanford Professor Yamato
Ichihashi, who was a member of
the staff of the Japanese delega
tion to the conference.
In 1933-34, the first year of the
Roosevelt administration, there were
a couple of lectures on the new gov
ernment. The only program which
reflected the coming menace to the
democratic nations was a lecture by
Sir Norman Angcll on "The Crisis
in Democracy: Ways Out."
In 1935-30 a series of four lec
tures and recitals on Richard Wag
ner and"The Ring" were present
ed. The approaching crisis in Eur

ope and the Far East was shown
by the fact that 8 out of a total of
27 subjects were devoted to lec
tures on different phases of this
vital subject.
The first year of war for the
United Stated, 1941-42, showed a
drop of some 5,000 from the previous
year's attendance; "but," explained
the President's annual report for
that year, "this was due in part to
blackouts and restrictions on tires."
It added that in the 5 years preced
ing, Series programs had drawn
133,233 listeners.
Some of the famous speakers
who have appeared on the Tues
day Evening Series arc William
Rose Benct, Kcrmit Roosevelt, Roy
W. Howard, Louis Adamic, Lewis
Mumford, C. S. Forester, Villijal

EDGAR EUGENE ROBINSON.
Professor of American History.

This Filipino, having hatJ the mis
fortune to full into Jap hands, was
found dead, resting on a fallen
bpanish iron gate, inside Manila's
walled city.
"Two theories have always been j
the basis on which the Tuesday Eve- |
ning Series progiams have been cho- |
sen, and they are the distribution !
of subject matter and the policy of
having student advisors," said Ed«ar
Eugene Robinson, professor of Am
erican history, and long time mem
ber and chairman of the Committee
of Public Exercises- which sponsors
the series, in an interview with the
Daily recently.

Isj the policy «»f distributing
subject matter, said Dr. Robinson,
the Series each inonlh tries to have
one lecture on science, one on lec
ture. art. or music; one on history
or the social sciences; and an eve
ning 011 public affairs or a movie.
"The Tuesday Series runs no
competition, because there is no
organization similar to it in this

region." Dr. Robinson said, "so that
by not specializing in subject mat
ter. it can present programs that
will appeal to almost everyone."
The second theory, that of seeking
.student advisors, was also emphasiz
ed by Hubert C. Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and present
chairman of the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises. "The Committee would
appreciate suggestions from faculty
members and students that wouh!
make the programs of greater ser
vice to the University," Said Mr.
Heffner, "but we especially want the
students' opinions."
The history of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series goes hack to the days
of David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, who or
ganized the Series to "share the
fine specialists on this campus and
their knowledge with the com
munity," said Mr. Heffner.
For many years Tuesday Series
programs were held only infre
quently, but by 1920 they were well
established among campus functions
and were part of the weekly doings
of Stanford life.
"The Committee of Public Ex
ercises is a faculty committee,"
explained Dr. Robinson, "and
planning the Tuesday Evening
Scries is only one of its functions.
It arranges all public activities,
including commencement. Found
ers' Day.and (he entertainment of
visitors, which is one of its most
important duties."
Tuesday Series programs used to
be held in the old Little Theater in
Room 100, he added; it was later
moved to the old Assembly Hall
which no longer exists. The latter
was torn down in 1937, was Mr. Hef

flier's explanation, and the School of
Business occupies that site now.
"Many times wo have been caught
in funny and frantic situations," said
Mr. Heffner, "One time when Laura
Bolton was due to arrive in San
Francisco early on the morning of
her lecture. She wired us that her
train was late and that she wouldn't
arrive until 3 in the afternoon. That
wasn't so bad, but when a second
telegram arived saying she wasn't
going to get in until 5, we were
frantic. We hurriedly lined up a "folk
music program, but Miss Bolton did
arrive—and only just before the
program was to start.
"A couple of years ago," lie con
tinued, "we had a music program
hooked for a Series performance.
The artist who was to give the
program was delayed, and only a
few hours before the program was
to start we found out he couldn't
come. Immediately we called Dr.
Warren D. Allen who gave an out
standing program 011 the harpis
chord with demonstrations.
"We couldn't do this if we did'nt
have a gifted, versatile, and coop
erative faculty body to help us
out," he added; "we always have
to be prepared for an emergency
a few hours in advance."
Not only is the Series designed to
bring to the campus outstanding
people who have something to con
tribute that we don't have, but it is
used also to share with the campus
and community the interesting work
our faculty members do that other
wise doesn't enter into the general
academic program, declared Mr.
Heffner. Many members of our fac
ulty are asked for various national
special services; they go to many
places, and when they return with
interesting stories to report we put
them on the Tuesday Series pro
grams, he explained.
Music and art occupy an im
portant position on the Tuesday
Series agenda, said Mr. Heffner.
Most of the musical programs arc
sponsored by the Friends of Mu
sic, a group of peninsula people,
headed this year by Mrs. Russell
Lee, who donate money for most
of the music programs.
In the summer, in cooperation
with the Elizabeth Sprague Cool
idge Music Foundation, they bring
a series of chamber music con
certs —from 4 to (i—of which 2 go
on the Tuesday Evening Series;
the rest are presented on other
evenings, Mr. Heffner said. "We
are deeply indebted to the Friends
of Music at Stanford for the series
of outstanding music programs we
couldn't have otherwise had," he
added.
Every year Dr. Tressider appoints
an administrative committee with its
powers established by the trustees
to help various organizations, de
partments, and schools to present
what they have to the campus com
munity in the best way possible,
said Mr. Heffner. This Committee of
Public Exercises has a budget set
up by which they are able to obtain
outside speakers in this region to

Daily recently.

Isj the policy «»f distributing
subject matter, said Dr. Robinson,
the Series each inonlh tries to have
one lecture on science, one on lec
ture. art. or music; one on history
or the social sciences; and an eve
ning 011 public affairs or a movie.
"The Tuesday Series runs no
competition, because there is no
organization similar to it in this

region." Dr. Robinson said, "so that
by not specializing in subject mat
ter. it can present programs that
will appeal to almost everyone."
The second theory, that of seeking
.student advisors, was also emphasiz
ed by Hubert C. Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and present
chairman of the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises. "The Committee would
appreciate suggestions from faculty
members and students that wouh!
make the programs of greater ser
vice to the University," Said Mr.
Heffner, "but we especially want the
students' opinions."
The history of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series goes hack to the days
of David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, who or
ganized the Series to "share the
fine specialists on this campus and
their knowledge with the com
munity," said Mr. Heffner.
For many years Tuesday Series
programs were held only infre
quently, but by 1920 they were well
established among campus functions
and were part of the weekly doings
of Stanford life.
"The Committee of Public Ex
ercises is a faculty committee,"
explained Dr. Robinson, "and
planning the Tuesday Evening
Scries is only one of its functions.
It arranges all public activities,
including commencement. Found
ers' Day.and (he entertainment of
visitors, which is one of its most
important duties."
Tuesday Series programs used to
be held in the old Little Theater in
Room 100, he added; it was later
moved to the old Assembly Hall
which no longer exists. The latter
was torn down in 1937, was Mr. Hef

flier's explanation, and the School of
Business occupies that site now.
"Many times wo have been caught
in funny and frantic situations," said
Mr. Heffner, "One time when Laura
Bolton was due to arrive in San
Francisco early on the morning of
her lecture. She wired us that her
train was late and that she wouldn't
arrive until 3 in the afternoon. That
wasn't so bad, but when a second
telegram arived saying she wasn't
going to get in until 5, we were
frantic. We hurriedly lined up a "folk
music program, but Miss Bolton did
arrive—and only just before the
program was to start.
"A couple of years ago," lie con
tinued, "we had a music program
hooked for a Series performance.
The artist who was to give the
program was delayed, and only a
few hours before the program was
to start we found out he couldn't
come. Immediately we called Dr.
Warren D. Allen who gave an out
standing program 011 the harpis
chord with demonstrations.
"We couldn't do this if we did'nt
have a gifted, versatile, and coop
erative faculty body to help us
out," he added; "we always have
to be prepared for an emergency
a few hours in advance."
Not only is the Series designed to
bring to the campus outstanding
people who have something to con
tribute that we don't have, but it is
used also to share with the campus
and community the interesting work
our faculty members do that other
wise doesn't enter into the general
academic program, declared Mr.
Heffner. Many members of our fac
ulty are asked for various national
special services; they go to many
places, and when they return with
interesting stories to report we put
them on the Tuesday Series pro
grams, he explained.
Music and art occupy an im
portant position on the Tuesday
Series agenda, said Mr. Heffner.
Most of the musical programs arc
sponsored by the Friends of Mu
sic, a group of peninsula people,
headed this year by Mrs. Russell
Lee, who donate money for most
of the music programs.
In the summer, in cooperation
with the Elizabeth Sprague Cool
idge Music Foundation, they bring
a series of chamber music con
certs —from 4 to (i—of which 2 go
on the Tuesday Evening Series;
the rest are presented on other
evenings, Mr. Heffner said. "We
are deeply indebted to the Friends
of Music at Stanford for the series
of outstanding music programs we
couldn't have otherwise had," he
added.
Every year Dr. Tressider appoints
an administrative committee with its
powers established by the trustees
to help various organizations, de
partments, and schools to present
what they have to the campus com
munity in the best way possible,
said Mr. Heffner. This Committee of
Public Exercises has a budget set
up by which they are able to obtain
outside speakers in this region to
come to the campus.
It is a valuable educational ad
vantage, lie said, "Our biggest sup
port. comes from the community, but
in normal times people came from
all over this section of the penin
sula."
Fourteen faculty members com
prise the Committee of Public Ex
ercises for 1944-45. They arc Dr.
Warren I). Allen, University Or
-1 ganist; Thomas A. Bailey, profes
sor of history; Chilton R. Bush,
professor of journalism; Lorcn R.
Chandler, dean of the School of
Medicine; Paul 11. Davis, general
secretary of (he University; John
W. Dodds, dean of (he School of
Humanities; J'aul E Holdcn of the
Graduate School of Business;
George E. Osborne, professor of
law; Herbert Jan Popper, assistant
professor of music; Hugh 11. Skill
ing, acting dean of the School of
Engineering; F. Cowles Strickland,
associate professor of speech and
drama, on leave this quarter; V.
C. Twitty. professor of biology; C.
Langdon White, professor of geo
graphy; and Mr. Ileffner.
A sflb-committee of four meets
every Thursday noon to plan the

Tuesday Scries. They are Professor
Bush, Professor Strickland, Mr. Hef
fner, and Mrs. Yvonne H. Dane, sec
retary to the Committee on Public
Exercises. All Scries programs are
booked a quarter in advance, said
Mr. HelTner.
Dr. Robinson, who left the com
mittee in 1941, added some informa
tion on the history of past Series
programs and other activities of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
"Before the war," he said, "we had
a Wednesday afternoon scries which
was more highly specialized than the
Tuesday Series, and which was de
signed mainly for visiting scholars."
In the last lew years, he added, the
Tuesday Series sponsored several
symposiums. "We had half a dozen
on the war before the United States
entered, and they were very popu
lar. Others were given on current
subjects."
Dr. Robinson had several amus
ing incidents connected with the
early Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams to recount. "When they
were held in the old Little Thea
ter," he said, "it used to be my
job to carry a glass of water clear
across the Quad for the speaker's
use. For in those days the water
was turned off at night, and there
was no other way for the speaker
to have any."
When he was first put on the com
mittee, he said, he was in charge of
marking of! the department's places
on Quad in front of the Memorial
Church in preparation for Com
mencement Exercises "I was so ner
vous that I got down on Quad at 5
in the morning to begin marking off
their places. Of course I finished
long before Commencement was
scheduled to start, but by then it
was too late for me to get some of
the sleep I need not have missed.
And after all that, 1 found 1 had ar
ranged it so that the men entered
the church before the women!"
Another time, he said, a Tuesday
Series chairman invited a man to
come down to be speaker for the
evening. He took Itini to his house
for dinner, after which they walked
down Quad to the Little Theater
where the speaker was scheduled to
appear. But the door was locked,
the place was dark, and no one was
there. It wasn't until then that the
chairman realized that he had for
gotten to give the speaker any ad
vance publicity!
Students themselves have contrib
uted to Tuesday Series programs in
past years. Telford Work, Navy Med
student whose picture "Trail Pack
ing in the Trinity Alps" was a recent
program, filmed another picture,
"The Eagle," several years ago and
brought it to the Committee of Pub
lic Exercises as a possible program
subject. "We liked it," Said Dr. Rob
inson, "and as a Series program it
proved very popular."
He told of another time several
years ago when some Stanford stud
ents took an around-thc-world trip.
When they returned, 4 or 5 of them
gave a report on the journey at a
Tuesday Evening Scries program.
When the Scries first started, said
Dr. Robinson, average attendance
was about 75 to 100 people a night;
in the academic year 1940-41 32,000
people comprised the total Scries
audience.
The Scries programs give an in
teresting clue to current history.
In 1921-22, the year of the Wash
ington Conference, nearly onc
fifth of the programs dealt with
some phase of the Far East, a re
gion which figured prominently in
( onfcrcncc plans. Three lectures
in succession were given on the
conference, including one by form
er Stanford Professor Yamato
Ichihashi, who was a member of
the staff of the Japanese delega
tion to the conference.
In 1933-34, the first year of the
Roosevelt administration, there were
a couple of lectures on the new gov
ernment. The only program which
reflected the coming menace to the
democratic nations was a lecture by
Sir Norman Angcll on "The Crisis
in Democracy: Ways Out."
In 1935-30 a series of four lec
tures and recitals on Richard Wag
ner and"The Ring" were present
ed. The approaching crisis in Eur

ope and the Far East was shown
by the fact that 8 out of a total of
27 subjects were devoted to lec
tures on different phases of this
vital subject.
The first year of war for the
United Stated, 1941-42, showed a
drop of some 5,000 from the previous
year's attendance; "but," explained
the President's annual report for
that year, "this was due in part to
blackouts and restrictions on tires."
It added that in the 5 years preced
ing, Series programs had drawn
133,233 listeners.
Some of the famous speakers
who have appeared on the Tues
day Evening Series arc William
Rose Benct, Kcrmit Roosevelt, Roy
W. Howard, Louis Adamic, Lewis
Mumford, C. S. Forester, Villijal
mur Stefansson, and llu Shih.
Sorry, this last is China's am
bassador to the United States, not
the real live model for Milt Caniff's
character.

"Two theories have always been j
