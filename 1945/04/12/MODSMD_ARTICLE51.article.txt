# Excom OK's Frosh Head
## 
### 
Gordon Levy was unanimously
appointed president of the freshman
class at Excom's meeting last night,
replacing Moi-ley Thompson, called
into the Merchant Marine. Levy re
ceived the appointment apparently
with the support of freshman opin
ion, by virtue of being runner-up in
the election of officers last quarter.
A budget of $t>o4 to allow a band,
refreshments, and decorations for
the freshman dance, scheduled May
5, was approved by Excom, to the
relief of frosh members present, who
feared that as the final function of
Con Home week, the dance would
have to be extremely informal as
was traditional.
An informal all-campus dance,
preceded by a barbecue, might be
given a week from Saturday night,
from which the proceeds could be
directed to the Con Home Drive,
Marylou McClure, A.S.S.U. vice
president, suggested. This would re
place the donation usually made to
the Drive as profits from the frosh
dance.
Pamela Strathairn, in speaking for
Women's Conference, suggested that
this organization sponsor a fashion
show, as it did in the past, for the
benefit of Con Home.
UNRAR clothing drive will com
mence April 21 under the direction
of newly appointed chairman Shir
ley Jamison. This drive will be co
ordinated through living group col-
