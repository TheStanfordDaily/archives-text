# Hopkins, WLB Consultant, Tells All on Wartime Labor Headaches
## 
### ELLEN MARCUS 
When the Pacific Greyhound em
ployees went on strike last summer
to protest against carrying "standee"
passengers and upset the transpor
taiton of the entire Bay Area, the
War Labor Board called on one of
its "oldest inhabitants," William S.
Hopkins, associate professor of eco
nomics at Stanford, to serve as chair
man of the arbitration board.
Since December 1942, when the
Tenth Regional War Labor Board
was first set up, Dr. Hopkins has
served the WLB first as head con
sultant ("or what the Standard Oil
Company would call a relief man at
the service station"), when he pinch
hit for everyone from the regional
director to the reception clerk. At
the same time, he had the continuing
duty of representing the board on
other war agencies such as the OPA,
the WMC, and the WPB.
WLB Veteran
When the burden bccamc too great
for Dr. Hopkins to hold in addition
to his teaching duties at Stanford, he
asked to be relieved of that position
and has since handled disputed cases
for the WLB, wheh, he remarked,
arc less burdensome. "I feel like a
veteran," he added, "as I've been in
the WLB even before it started to
operate."
Before the Tenth Regional Board,
which has jurisdiction over all labor
disputes affecting the war effort in
California, Nevada, Arizona, and Ha
waii, was established Dr. Hopkins
acted as special arbitrator for the
National War Labor Board.
Public Panel Member
Now Dr. Hopkins holds the title
of public panel member and serves
as chairman of the panel along with
a representative from industry and
one from labor on all cases which the
WLB delegates to him. Since he has
held this position, Dr. Hopkins has
handled hundreds of cases, but the
two most conspicuous in his opinion
were the cannery cases, which af
fected 70,000 employees in all the
canneries from the Tehachapi Moun
tains to the Oregon line, and the
Greyhound case which occupied so
much public attention last summer
and fall. "I've spent many a sleep
less night on both of them," com
mented Dr. Hopkins.
The Greyhound case started with
the dispute instigated by the bus
drivers in their refusal to carry
standee passengers. Subsequently
every section of hte contract between
the bus drivers and the Pacific Grey
hound Company was under dispute,
138 issues in all. Hearings were be
gun by Dr. Hopkins and his two as
sociates on the public panel on Au
gust 30, 1944, and have only recently

ended.
Wage Scale Trouble
"The main trouble was over wage
scales which were most complex,"
stated Hopkins. "Different drivers
were paid by different rates depend
ing on which kind of runs they had.
'Over-the-road' drivers were paid by
the mile, local drivers were paid by
the hour, other drivers were guar
anteed a daily minimum, and sta
tion employees were paid by the
month."
By the present rulings of the WLB
and the ODT, buses must carry a
limited number of passengers on
over-the-road runs—a total load of
150 per cent of seating capacity—but
in local service, they may carry as
many as the'bus will hold. This rul
ing and the final one which will be
announced shortly affect all the
Greyhound buses from El Paso to
Portland, from Salt Lake to Los An
geles, and all intermediate areas.
WLB Ends After War
"The WLB is entirely a wartime
agency," Hopkins emphasized. "It
automatically goes out of existence
six months after the end of the war.
I don't know if a peace-time boaid
will be created or not."
At the beginning of the war, Dr.
Hopkins held the position of senior
employment officer for the War Re
location Authority, and was thereby
in charge of all employment within
the projects. After five and a half
months, he was transferred to Wash
ington, D.C.; but rather than leave
the coast and Stanford, Hopkins re
signed and was appointed acting di
rector of the Wage Stabilization Au
thority. A few months later he was
transferred to the WLB.
Travels Extensively
In 1939 and 1940, when Hopkins
had a year's leave from Stanford,
he worked for the Social Science
Council in Washington, D.C. His du
ties consisted of traveling through
all the 48 states granting funds for
research assistants in the social sci
ences.
Dr. Hopkins graduated from the

University of Oiegon where he re
ceived both his 13.A. and M.A. de
grees. He received his Ph.D. from
Stanford in 1932 and had since
taught economics, specializing in la
bor problems. During a two-year
exchange professorship at the Uni
versity of Washington between 1935
and 1937, he worked for the Social
Security Advisory Board for the
state of Washington.
