Speaking of Operations!
An invasion fleet of several hundred warships uses
some 48,000 telephones—from 1,500 on a battle
ship to 10 on a motor torpedo hoat. That's as
many as are used by most cities of 160,000!
Our fighting men are using telephones, wire,
switchboards, and other communications equip
ment in huge quantities. And Western Electric
workers, peacetime suppliers to the Bell System,
are busy meeting those needs.
That is why there are not enough borne tele
phones right now. But Ave are looking forward to
the day when the Bell System can again provide
telephone service to anyone, anywhere, at any time.
