# Franklin D. Rooseveltâ€”1882-1945
## 
### 
The death of Franklin Roosevelt finds us with
out the ability or the desire to fathom the course
of the great unfinished work which is testimony
to the place the late president occupies in our
lives.
Instead we find ourselves pausing with a be
numbed nation to consider the personal impact
which this death holds for all of us who can
remember no other President, whose considera
tion of public service and what it should be, has
come to some mature expression during his
years in office.
We have had the passionate nature of the
attacks and the defense of his policies dinned
into our ears. From simple onesided matters of
right and wrong we have gained some realiza
tion of the complexity of the problems, and how
great was the fear that has clutched at our par
ents during these years.
Far from a mere war president, Mr. Roosevelt
has had eii'ect upon our persons in the troublous
years since the depression. Our estimation be
fore history involves the consideration of un
reasoning fury, as well as adulation.
The honest statements of those who say they
do not feel that they could have kept their
homes had it not been for his aid, may not bear
full weight in history, but they are part of the
real expression we have, in the four times
that the nation, as a whole, has endorsed his
leadership.
Whatever the maelstrom of social change has
been, and where one may have been caught in
deciding whether or not the performance of
Franklin D. Roosevelt was reckless or coura
geous, at no time could our nation fail to realize
that we had a leader who rose above the side
issues and half-issues and who always repre
sented the strength and courage of his own faith
in America's future.
The national struggle never became sordid in
his hands, but rather one of a vital people. From
the early years of 1932, his strong gaze and ex
pressive voice, practically alone, sounded a
note of confidence in a frightened and tense
nation. So, only a few months before we ever
dreamt that the most familiar voice would stop

sounding American faith and hope for the fu
ture, it keynoted the confidence of men for the
future of a better peace. And most men believed
it.
Of Franklin Roosevelt's zest for living we only
suspect that the world had gained better battles,
no man bested him and many men tried; his
chuckle could be heard the length and breadth
of his thirteen years as "the Champ".
We are only sure now that the loss is ours;
and it is deep. We think he would not regret
one ounce of the effort that he put behind his
convictions. No man fought harder for peace
which now, at last, has come to the late presi
dent.


FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT
