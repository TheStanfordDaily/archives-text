# Elbe Crossed, Berlin to Go

### 
PARIS, April 10 (UP).—American
Ninth Army tank forces crashed over
the Elbe River today and were re
ported approaching the suburban
area of Berlin tonight. One semi
official report placcd the Yanks
within 49 miles of the Reich capital.
A strict security blackout, lifted
temporarily to reveal that the Ninth
Army bridged the Elbe in the Mag
deburg area, hid movements of the
tank forces beyond the river—last
natural barrier before Berlin.
Rumors and speculation of all
kinds swept throughout the world
as the battle of Berlin neared its
climactic stage. One wholly uncon

j firmed report .said thai Allied para-
I troopers had landed only 16 miles
I from the capital in the path of the
! advancing Americans.
Charging in from the ea.st. the
j Russians were meeting fierce resist -
j ance on the approaches to Berlin,
radio Moscow said, but in the west
the American tanks were believed
speeding along virtually unopposed
down the home stretch.
A junction between the Americans
and Russians seemed near. Secre
tary of War Henry L. Stimson said
in Washington that the east-west
forces now are 75 miles apart at some
points.
