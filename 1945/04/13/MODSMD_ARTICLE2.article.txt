From Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur came the following
statement:
"President Roosevelt has been our national
leader through a long period of trial when our
country was caught in a series of crises due to
two great world-wide wars. With the nation
assuming more and more significance in a great
and tragic world its responsibility for the future
became more and more evident. President
Roosevelt caught the imagination of millions of
people throughout the world who looked to
him and the strength of the United States either
with hope or with fear. His sudden death
changes many things in the twinkling of an eye.
After a long and crippling illness it seems ap
propriate that his death should come suddenly
and without suffering.
Circumstances made it possible for him to
name his own successor and to live long
enough to start him on his way. We can have
confidence in President Truman's loyalty and
willingness to give his full measure of service."
