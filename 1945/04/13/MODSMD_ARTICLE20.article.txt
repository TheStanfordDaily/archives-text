# FROM PLAN TO PRACTICE

### 
SOCIAL PROGRAM
University living units, scrubbed and shining,
stand ready this afternoon to welcome freshmen
and other new women as the first lap of the
Housing Committee's new social program gets
under way. Number one brain-child of the com
mittee throughout last quarter's tussle over
housing plans, the social program is designed
to acquaint all new women with the members
and type of living in each University unit.
Upon no other point during the entire session
of meetings was the committee so whole-heart
edly in agreement. A social program and policy
based on informal, natural methods of meeting
and knowing new women is considered the
backbone of the committee's recommended
plan for housing which is now under admini
stration scrutiny. The carrying out of all the
fine-sounding ideals of "congeniality" and
"group responsibility" upon which committee
members base their hopes for a "unified Stan
ford community" is dependent upon the co
operation and attitude of both new and old wo
men as the weekend open houses progress.
As planned by the social sub-committee of
Housing Committee the first series of open
houses will give freshmen an opportunity to
see all living groups. No refreshments will be
served ana there will be no entertainment.
Freshmen are asked to look carefully at the
housing set-up of each group and to remember
what the obligations and responsibilities, ad
vantages or disadvantages would be in living
in the different types of units. Later social func
tions will enable new and old women to become
acquainted as individuals.
The test, then, of a new experiment in hous
ing Stanford women begins today. Whether or
not the specific housing plan which incorpor
ates this social program will be adopted is not
yet known. But any plan that bars rushing and
group selection of its own members requires
an exercise of good judgement, and under
standing, and a sincere effort on the part of
every Stanford woman to secure a solution to
a troubled situation.—H. D.
