### PEGGY FITTS 
THE LATE PRESIDENT IS HISTORY
It's four o'clock. The Cellar is quiet. The usual
people are there, with their milk-shakes and
cigarettes, but nobody is talking much. In the
Daily Shack, people come and go in a hurry,
trying to put the paper together, with a radio on
loud, telling us what the world thinks.
People are leaving the Reserve Book Room,
carrying their binders, their faces half excited,
half stunned. People stop and turn in the sun
light, calling to friends across the Quad, by the
Post Office, up the Row.
"Did you hear-"
"I can't believe it!"
"What'll we do now?"
Nobody knows quite what to say.
For the first time since 1922, we have lost a
President in office. For the first time in history,
we have lost a great national figure who was
also a great world figure—on whom, personally
and directly, much of the world's future de
pended.
The unfinished business of one life afnd mil
lions of others, including our own, is something
to think about, but later. Right now the speeches
and statements of great men everywhere don't
fill the emptiness we all feel. Some of us are
thinking of December 7, three years ago, when
v/e heard the news that peace had ended, and
now something else has ended.
But school goes on, the war goes on, and the
j i ion goes on. The machinery of ordinary life
112 !!- tho gaps, and v/e find out we haven't for

! gotten how to do things and accept things we
hoped would never have to be done or accepted
by us.
You get used to living in the middle of his
tory. The late President is history now, and be
cause of him this day is history. So we'll re
member what kind ©112 a day it was here at
Stanford, and how we were told the news and
told it to others, in the Cellar, in the Libe, in
the Daily shack, on the Quad, and how nobody
knew quite v/hat to say.
