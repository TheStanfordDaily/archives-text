### Elliot Epsteen 
President Roosevelt is dead. The hard-to-believe, al
most paralyzing message came to us over the radio
yesterday afternoon.
The President was more than a man to America.
He was a personality, and not a synthetic one at that.
That this is all gone is hard to believe.
It is hard to say what will happen to the leadership
of the New Deal. Domestically we have been ruled

by a group whose
elements showed
friction rather than
integration. Mr.
Roosevelt, despite
what we hight think
of his policies, man
aged to keep them in
working order and
away from each oth
er's throats.
It is also hard to
say what will hap
pen to the Democrat
ic party. Even more,
it is difficult to pre
dict the effect on our
foreign affairs, ex
cept to say that the
man whose person
ality no doubt often
brought calm out of
near-strife, is gone.
Everything depends

upon Vice-President
Truman, who will

assume the leadership of the nation.
There are many things to be said against him. First
of all, his relations with the Pendergast machine were
shown to be somewhat intimate. Secondly, his sym
pathies as a Southerner will no doubt make things diffi
cult lor him.
But, on the other hand, it must be admitted that he
showed rare statesmanship in his conduct of the Tru
man Committee, and the one time he brought a case
before the whole nation, during the recent national
campaign, he talked sense.
Yet now speculation as to the future is impossible,
since it has no accurate logical basis. Time alone can
tell all.
