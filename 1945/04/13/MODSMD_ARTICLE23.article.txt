# World Peace Notes—'4s

### TED DRENTON 
Men may beat up other men simply for the joy of it;
however, nations do not engage in combat unless they
have an economic reason, which means in simple words
"hunger" for food, money, or land. The men who
drafted the Dumbarton Oaks proposals clearly per
ceived this and so suggested that an international Eco
nomic andlSocial Council be created to deal with such
essential problems.
The Council will be elected by the general assem
bly of the United Nations and will consist of 18 mem
bers serving three-year terms. Of most importance
the Big Five—America, England, Russia. China and
France—will have no more authority on the council
than any other group of nations, which is strikingly
contrary to the arrangement of the Security Council
or VV orld Police Department.
The organization will have as its main duty the
problem of facilitating "solutions of internatonal eco
nomic, social, and other humanitarian problems." So
lution of these problems is vital for international sta
bility and for peaceful friendly relations among nations.
Another necessity for peace is the promotion of re
spect for "human rights and fundamental freedoms."
Although the Economic and Social Council will act
under instructions of the General Assembly, the
Council nevertheless may act on its own initiative
in the study of humanitarian porblems and in the
making of recommendations to the Assembly.
The Council will assist the Assembly whenever in
formation is requested and will of course work with
the secretary-general of the world organization. Va*
rious international organizations which are now in exis
tence or have been proposed will be coordinated under
the Council.
These include: The International Bank, the Cur
rency Stabilization Fund, the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration, and the International
Labor Organization. The Council will elect its own
president and all decisions will be taken by simple
majority vote.
Through the Economic Council the United Nations
will attempt to prevent war by seeking to solve the
various "hunger" problems of the world's nations.
The Council will oDerate as social agencies in our
own country do; that is, they attempt to prevent a
young man front turning to robbery by training him
for a job and giving him opportunity for an ade
quately paid job.
For instance the Security or Economic Councils might
suggest new trade agreements be negotiated among
nations that have trade barriers and resulting economic
rivalries which could threaten war.
