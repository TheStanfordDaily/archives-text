CONSCRIPTION AGAIN
Dear Editor:
A recent request to Congress by the Department of
State should be of interest to everyone who is trying <
to make a decision on the advisablity of peacetime con- !
scription. On April 7, the State Department asked Con
gress to delay all consideration of postwar military ,
training until summer.
The reason given was that it would "muddy the ;
waters" if Congress were to dscuss this issue at a time j
when the nations of the world were assembling to try i
to establish a just and durable peace.
It is obvious that the San Francisco Conference will !
only be able to tackle a few of the problems of peace, |
leaving many more to be solved in the days ahead, even
after the war is over.
If we apply the reasoning of the State Department
completely, it should be apparent that any enactment
of a program of postwar conscription before we know
what the peace will be like would be a serious threat
to a successful peace.
A very rfTective way to express opposition to fur
ther attempts to enact peacetime conscription during
wartime is by writing to members of Congress and
newspaper editors.
