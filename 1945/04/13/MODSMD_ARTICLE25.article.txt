# 'Thin Man' Offers More Comedy Than Murder
## 
### 
"The Thin Man Goes Home," in
spite of its three corpses and a town
full of melodrama villains, has more

to offer in the
way of comedy
than in murders.
The story cen
ters around Nick
and Nora Charles
(William Powell
and Myrna Loy),
in true Thin Man
style, who this
time are going to
spend their va-

cation with Nick's parents in a small

town. Between gulps from a cider
jug, they create the corpses and find
little - suspected murderers hiding
behind choir book?; and cocoa cups.
There were plenty of laughs all
the way through, though, to help you
forget that a mystery was trying to
go on in the background. Then there
was Powell's amour. It must be
through pure sentimentality over I
their earlier Thin Man pictures that
Myrna Loy will put up with his
ever-multiplying chins and ever-re
ceding hair line.
The second feature now at the
Stanford is a weak imitation of a
high school play. Its name is
"Blonde Trouble"—nufT said. Mary

Astor makes another feeble attempt
to be glamorous, and two new hope
fuls just attempt. Mary Astor, the
wife, finds her husband making mad
love in the cellar with a blonde. For
ever the martyr, Astor bravely an
nounces that she will leave peace
fully. Complications then set in—
money gone, Astor gone, blonde
gone. The wine cellar lover recovers
Astor and peace reigneth, allah.—
