# Early Indian Cole's Topic
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
It probably doesn't mean a thing
if you should turn over a man's
skull while digging out behind the
Farm on a Physical Science 5 survey
trip. But it did mean something
when a group of University of Chi
cago archaeologists overturned one
while digging near some Indian
mounds in Fulton County, Illinois,
several years ago.
Dr. Fay-Cooper Cole in his infor
j mal talk on North American archae
' ology for the American Studies sym
posium yesterday afternoon said that
the new find indicated a hitherto un
suspection typo of man had lived
in the area. In recent time's other
excavations in this and other sections
of the Mississippi Valley have been
| made in an attempt to tie together
| the Indian cultures there with those
of the Southwest, Dr. Cole said, and
to form a definite chronological ac
count.
Head of the Department of An-
I thropology at Chicago, Dr. Cole re
lated how he and a group of graduate
students set out to excavate the fa
mous Indian mounds of Illinois in
1930. With time and hard work they
pieced together a picture of the cul
j tural "horizons" of some of the
| mounds and reached as far back into
j the history of the region as 20.000
j years.
I In this primitive Indian history Dr.
j Cole said that there are two distinct
patterns which have been ascer
j tained from the burial mounds, pot
j tery, and the position of the dead,
j The two patterns — Woodland and
I Mississippi—can both be found in the
j valley and show signs of influence
j from the high Central American civ
j ilizations.
Dr. Cole concluded his talk by say
ing that although the knowledge of
the area is not yet as extensive as
of that of the Southwest, which he
has explored, much valuable work
has been done to discover the relics
of the region and to establish a
chronology.
