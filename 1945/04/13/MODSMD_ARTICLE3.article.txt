Dr. Tresidder released this statement:
"Like all my fellow Americans, I am shocked
at the tragic death of President Roosevelt. To
lose the benefit of his direct personal experi
ences with Winston Churchill and Marshal
Stalin is a grevious blow at a time of great
crisis. His death serves as a reminder of the
crushing load which he has been carrying."
