# Wolter Still Going Strong After 20 Years at Farm

### BOB SLOBE 
"Prospects for the return of base
ball to Stanford in 1!)4<» are exceed
ingly good, if enrollment picks up by
that time." surmised Harry Wolter
when asked of the possibilities of
an intercollegiate baseball team.
"Sports at this time are impossible
when you realize that, although
Stanford has an enrollment of over
800 civilian students, almost half of
these are graduate students and
many of the rest are not athletes,"
he added.
Wolter's baseball background dis
plays ample evidence that he "prac
tices what he preaches," for he was
one of the best players to play in the
Coast League.
Began with Fresno
His college days consisted of three
years at Santa Clara, but that was
cut short by the earthquake of 1906,
and Wolter, left without a school to
attend, went into professional base
ball with Fresno of the Pacific Coast
League and at the close of the sea
son was sold to Cincinnati of the
National League. After two years
with the "Reds," he went to the
Boston Americans, and from there
to the Highlanders, the present day
New York Yankees. A southpaw,
Wolter began his career as a pitcher,
and because of his slugging poten
tialities, he was moved to center field.
"None of those easy times a pitcher
has nowadays; when we weren't
chucking, we played in the out
field," laughed Wolter. "My job was
pitching twice a week and holding
down an outfield spot the other five
; days. Oh, yes, we played seven days
j a week."
Batted .354
When he left the Highlanders,
Wolters journeyed to the Los An
■ geles Angels where he had two
successful seasons, hitting a solid
.347 his first year and taking sec
' ond batting honors with an aver
age of .354 in 1015. Although
! slowed up by a broken leg suf
fered while sliding into second
base when with the Highlanders,
he went up to the Chicago Cubs
and thence to Sarcamento where
he had two more years of .300 or
I above hitting. He then left base
ball for good after having com
piled a lifetime batting average
that was over . 300.
Here Since '23
After coaching Stanford for the
1916 season, he came back to stay in
1923 and has been here ever since.
Wolter said that his last outstanding
team was in '26, and that since then
we have only beaten California
! twice. "When it wasn't lack of good
batters we didn't have any pitchers
and vice versa, and just when we had
the best frosh ball team in years,
the war came along and with it came
the end of a possible winning squad,"
said Wolter.
Wolter has always been interested
in boys, and since 1926 has donated
his time unselfishly to the supervi

sion of intramurals—baseball, bas
ketball, and football alike.
"Good football players will never
make good baseball players as a
rule," he stated. "This is mainly be
cause baseball players have long
muscles and have to be loose and
fiaxible, whereas good football play
ers are usually tight and rugged.
Take Sam Chapman for example.
He was a great football player for
California a few years back, and he
went straight into major league
baseball with the Philadelphia Ath
letics. He had a hard time holding
down his job the first season, but as
soon as his muscles loosened up, he
turned into a fair hitter."
"I have never regretted my choos
ing baseball as a career, for I have
made many lifetime friends, and had
a great deal of fun."
Wolter has little to say about his
present baseball class, but he is
ready to go to work on an inter-col
legiate team when he is given the
go signal by the administration. For
many years, Wolter has also taught
golf in conjunction with Eddie
Twiggs, regular golf instructor.
Although he is nearing 61, Har
ry, as the fellows like to speak of
him, can still rattle the hoards of
the sunken diamond with his sharp
line drives, and is still active in
his capacity as intramural director.
Strict at times, hut never unrea
sonable, he is, and always will be,
well liked by his students and all
others who know him.
