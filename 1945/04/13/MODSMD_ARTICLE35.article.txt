# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
With the flag at half-mast for the
nation's number one baseball fan. it
seems a rather inappropriate time to
dwell seriously on a subject as triv
ial as professional athletics. Base
ball has never been a vital factor in
the American scene, and it is prob
able that in the past twenty-four
hours very few of us have found time
to think much about it.
Nevertheless, the leagues continue
to operate, and no stoppage of play,
of course, is contemplated: so I will
do my best to bring fans up to date
on the past week's developments.
Seals Lose Again
Last week's series in the Pacific
Coast League found the Ump's pre
season predictions kicked in every
direction, but certain definite quali
ties of the teams are beginning to
show up. San Francisco's Seals
dropped their second series to the
theoretically weak Padres, 4 games
to 2. Contrary to our pre-season
opinions, the Seals' weakness was
at the plate, not on the mound. Bob
Joyce, Ken Miller, Okey Flowers,
Ken Brondell & Co. turned in cred
itable performances on the rubber,
but no pitcher ever won a game
without a run or two to back him up.
Pepper Martin's San Diego outfit
didn't look particularly strong, but
had the punch to beat the even
weaker (at the moment) O'Doulmen.
Angels Too
Meanwhile, our faith in the Los
Angeles aggregation suffered a se
vere blow as Seattle's beer boys
boys temporarily found their collec
tive eye and treated Sweeney's An
gels to a 4 to 2 drubbing. L.A.'s
weakness was in the hurling depart
ment. Seattle finding little difficulty
in scoring in droves.
Dolph Camilli's Oakland team
came closest to scoring a shut-out
series when they took care of Holly
wood to a tune of 5 games to 1. The
Oaks' sole strength was at the plate,
but it proved enough to overcome
the weak stars. Sensation of Emery
ville was 17-year-old Vic Piccetti,

who continues to batter the best
pitchers his opponents can offer.
Portland continued to blaze along,
defeating Sacramento, 4 to 2. Marv
Owens' Beavers just have too much
in every department.

This week's series find the Seals
and Portland split at one game each,
\ Hollywood and Seattle split the
same way, Oakland leading San Die
go and Sacramento beating Los An
| geles by 2 to 0.
Browns Come Through
Meanwhile the major leagues were
taking their final warm-up tosses in
[ preparation for the coming season.
Exhibition games were on every
hand, with the St. Louis city series
holding the spotlight.
