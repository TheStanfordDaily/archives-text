# Farm Fears Friday 13th, Dodges Daily Ladder
## 
### MARYAL SMITH ROD BROWNING 
So, you sneer at today's date with
a "Friday the thirteenth. So what!
I'M notN superstitious!"
But do you know that over 75 per
cent of the Farm students and fac
ulty who hurried down the outer
quad during the rush hours yes
terday morning purposely avoided
walking—or running—under the lad
der that was planted near the engi
neering corner by your roving re
porter.
Perhaps you were one of the 73
deliberate dodgers who shied away
from the braceless ladder around the
9 a.m. rush, or maybe you were
among the fearless 14 who boldly
walked under—unflinchingly.
Later in the morning, Dr. Rudolph
Holsti, Dr. Thomas Barclay, Profes

sor Georges Lemaitre. Miss Theressa
Gay, Western Civ librarian, and Dr.
and Mrs. Donald B. Tresidder were
among the more than 190 persons
who took the long way 'round, while
69 members of the Stanford family
braved the danger; with A 1 Marquez,
Pat Wright, Jody Le May, Dr. Au
relio Espinosa, Frank de Lisle, and
Dick Bower among them.
However, it was the ASTudents
who emerged with a reckless record.
During the morning four squads
courageously marched through the
ladder, and to top this off one un
willing section leader was dragged
under it by his buddies.
This survey may prove little about
the "superstitions" of Farm dwellers
who avoid arguing with swaying lad
ders, but it may convince some stu
dents and professors that there's no
escaping the Stanford Daily.

Do you hide out in a cave for seven
years after breaking a mirror? Do |
you set new sprinting records to get
around a black cat which has just
crossed your path? Do you carry so
many good - luck pieces in your
pocket that you have become a
lightning hazard? Many people
here on campus live up to these and I
a great many more superstitions.
Scared-o'-Cats
Don Miller, a cartoonist elite for
"Chaparral," said about the super
stitious element in his life, "I don't
really have any superstitions but I
do rather flinch when a black cat
runs across my path." Eve Borde,
vice-president of Branner, said she
couldn't think of anything witty to
say on the subject, but she then re
lated a perfectly fascinating tale
about how she and her roommate,
Barbara Quinn, covered a good many
miles of hill country in an attempt
to outrun a black cat which had
crossed their trail.
Dean Bunn bends over backward
to disprove the unlucky '13" super
stition. He had the number 13 on
all his basketball and baseball suits,
and good lugk certainly has to run
to keep up with the Dean.
Gamhlin' Man
Willie Davies, that gentleman of
Tyler Hall, said that he was quite a
believer in the saying "Lucky at
love, unlucky at cards." "If there is
a woman around when I'm gambling,
I my luck disappears," he said. I might
add that brother Willie is not the
only one who prefers looking at
women to looking at cards.
Mrs. Shotz, director of Toyon, said
she didn't believe in superstitions
and gave some very impressive rea
sons why.
Mrs. Sharpe has a red hat which
she often wears to ball games. Some
people claim that whenever Mrs.
Sharpe wears the hat to a Stanford
game, the Indians win.
Wood Workers
Do you thump the nearest piece of
wood with your fist every time you
boast about your Bawl-out average?
Do you spread your birthday cake
frosting all over your guests in a
fervent desire to blow out all the
candles? You don't? Hmmmmm.


TWO ROUGHS CHOOSE the long way 'round, as Friday 13th jitters

Later in the morning, Dr. Rudolph
Holsti, Dr. Thomas Barclay, Profes

sor Georges Lemaitre. Miss Theressa
Gay, Western Civ librarian, and Dr.
and Mrs. Donald B. Tresidder were
among the more than 190 persons
who took the long way 'round, while
69 members of the Stanford family
braved the danger; with A 1 Marquez,
Pat Wright, Jody Le May, Dr. Au
relio Espinosa, Frank de Lisle, and
Dick Bower among them.
However, it was the ASTudents
who emerged with a reckless record.
During the morning four squads
courageously marched through the
ladder, and to top this off one un
willing section leader was dragged
under it by his buddies.
This survey may prove little about
the "superstitions" of Farm dwellers
who avoid arguing with swaying lad
ders, but it may convince some stu
dents and professors that there's no
escaping the Stanford Daily.

Do you hide out in a cave for seven
years after breaking a mirror? Do |
you set new sprinting records to get
around a black cat which has just
crossed your path? Do you carry so
many good - luck pieces in your
pocket that you have become a
lightning hazard? Many people
here on campus live up to these and I
a great many more superstitions.
Scared-o'-Cats
Don Miller, a cartoonist elite for
"Chaparral," said about the super
stitious element in his life, "I don't
really have any superstitions but I
do rather flinch when a black cat
runs across my path." Eve Borde,
vice-president of Branner, said she
couldn't think of anything witty to
say on the subject, but she then re
lated a perfectly fascinating tale
about how she and her roommate,
Barbara Quinn, covered a good many
miles of hill country in an attempt
to outrun a black cat which had
crossed their trail.
Dean Bunn bends over backward
to disprove the unlucky '13" super
stition. He had the number 13 on
all his basketball and baseball suits,
and good lugk certainly has to run
to keep up with the Dean.
Gamhlin' Man
Willie Davies, that gentleman of
Tyler Hall, said that he was quite a
believer in the saying "Lucky at
love, unlucky at cards." "If there is
a woman around when I'm gambling,
I my luck disappears," he said. I might
add that brother Willie is not the
only one who prefers looking at
women to looking at cards.
Mrs. Shotz, director of Toyon, said
she didn't believe in superstitions
and gave some very impressive rea
sons why.
Mrs. Sharpe has a red hat which
she often wears to ball games. Some
people claim that whenever Mrs.
Sharpe wears the hat to a Stanford
game, the Indians win.
Wood Workers
Do you thump the nearest piece of
wood with your fist every time you
boast about your Bawl-out average?
Do you spread your birthday cake
frosting all over your guests in a
fervent desire to blow out all the
candles? You don't? Hmmmmm.


TWO ROUGHS CHOOSE the long way 'round, as Friday 13th jitters
hit the Farm.
So, you sneer at today's date with
a "Friday the thirteenth. So what!
I'M notN superstitious!"
But do you know that over 75 per
cent of the Farm students and fac
ulty who hurried down the outer
quad during the rush hours yes
terday morning purposely avoided
walking—or running—under the lad
der that was planted near the engi
neering corner by your roving re
porter.
Perhaps you were one of the 73
deliberate dodgers who shied away
from the braceless ladder around the
9 a.m. rush, or maybe you were
among the fearless 14 who boldly
walked under—unflinchingly.
