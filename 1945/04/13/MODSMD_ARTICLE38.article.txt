### 
In Sunday's movie at the Memo
rial Theater at 7:15 p.m., George
Sanders, alias the Saint, becomes
intricately involved with "jools,"
smugglers and dangerous characters,
occasionally doubling as the villain
himself. It's murder and the Saint
finds out â€”with the help of Helen
Whitney and Bela Lugosi.
