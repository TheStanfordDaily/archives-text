# Nation Mourns Roosevelt's Death on Eve of V-E Day
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 10 (UP).—
Franklin D. Roosevelt, for 12 un
precedented years President of the
United States, died today—a casualty
in history's greatest war. Tonight at
7:08 E.W.T., Harry S. Truman be
came the nation's 32nd President.
Mr. Roosevelt died suddenly in
"the Little White House" at Warm
Spi'ings, Ga., as armies he helped to
muster drove momentarily closer to
final victory over Nazi Germany.
Was 63 Years Old
Worn out at 63, he died as other
forces fighting in freedom's name
foretold the doom of militarist Japan.
He died on the eve of what he had
hoped would be the inauguration
of an era of peace in a world at long
last free of want and fear.
Mr. Roosevelt left as his successor
the 61-year-old Harry Truman of
Independence, Mo., a man who never
wanted to be President. The 31st
President died at 4:35 p.m. Eastern
War Time of "a massive cerebral
hemorrhage." The 32nd President
took the oath of office from Chief
Justice Harlan F. Stone less than
three hours later.
Truman Makes Statement
The new chief executive's first
statement was:
"It will be my effort, to carry on
as I believe the President would
have done, and to that end I have
asked the cabinet to stay on with
me."
Mr. Truman's second act as Presi
dent was to instruct Secretary of
State Edward Stettinius, Jr., to go
ahead "as planned" with what per
haps was Mr. Roosevelt's dearest
project—the United Nations Confer
ence at San Francisco April 25 to
chart a road to peace on earth.
Mr. Roosevelt's body will be
brought here tomorrow. Mrs. Roo
sevelt went to Warm Springs by
plane tonight to accompany her hus
band back to the White House for
the last time.
Funeral Services Tomorrow
Funeral services will be held in

the East Room of the White House
Saturday afternoon. Mr. Roosevelt's
last resting place will be on the
ancestral estate he loved at Hyde
Park, N.Y.
Mr. Truman was sworn in as Pres
ident in a brief ceremony in the cab
inet room of the White House. Mem
bers of the cabinet were flanked
around Truman and Justice Stone
during the ceremony, which took no
more than a minute.
Standing behind Truman was his
wife, whose eyes were tear-stained.
Members of the White House staff,
some of them with tear-stained eyes,
stood silently in the three doorways
and watched President Roosevelt's
successor sworn in.
Dies in Warm Springs, Ga.
Mr. Roosevelt died in a peaceful
rural scene. Commander Howard
Bruenn, a Navy doctor who was with
him, said the President was "in ex
cellent spirits" at 9:30 a.m. C.W.T.
today in Warm Springs.
Shortly before 1 p.m. the President
was sitting for some sketches. He
suddenly complained of a "terrific
headache." At 1:15 the President lost
consciousness. He died without pain
at 4:35 p.m. Eastern War Time.
Mr. Roosevelt's death was an-
Time. Mr. Truman was en route to
nounced at 5:48 p.m. Eastern War
the White House by then. Mrs. Roo
sevelt had been informed and cables
had been sent to the four Roosevelt
sons in the service to tell them that
their father was dead.
Capitol Flag Lowered
The cabinet converged on the
rambling white building where the
Roosevelts have lived so long. By
6:40 p.m. the flag on the Capitol was
lowered. Just more than an hour
later congressional leaders began
hurrying to the White House gates.
Tentative plans call for departure
of the President's funeral train from
Warm Springs at 8 a.m. C.W.T. to
morrow. It will reach Washington
early the next morning. The body
will not lie in state.
