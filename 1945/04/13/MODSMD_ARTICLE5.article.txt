### 
LONDON, Friday, April 13 (UP).
—A few minutes before the chimes
of Big Bun tolled the start of Friday,
April 13, the news reached Great
Britain that President Roosevelt —
Britain's number one friend — had
died.
Within a few moments the news
had swept the country and shocked
it.
King George was awakened and
told the news. Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill was advised at oner.
From all over the country, front
army and navy bases, from homes,
telephone calls deluged newspapers
from people who could not believe it
was true.
Within a few minutes Berlin was
on the air. The first reports by Ber
lin radio gave the news factually
without comment. Then, as if just
realizing the importance of the event,
the German Trans-Ocean agency
started broadcasting:
"Blitz! Blitz! Blitz! President
Roosevelt died on Thursday night,
according to American broadcasts."
Another few minutes and the Ber
lin radio said:
"Roosevelt will go down in history
as the man who caused the present
war."
