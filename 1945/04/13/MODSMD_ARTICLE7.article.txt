President of Stanford and United
States Secretary of the Interior —
those were only two of Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur's many titles. Today he
celerbates his 70th birthday, look
ing back on a life of work and
achievement.
He received the A.B. degree from
Stanford in 1896, and immediately
was made an instructor. In 1911 he
became dean of the Mcdical School,
and from 1916 to 1943 was president
of Stanford.

For four years he worked in
Washington as Secretary of the In
terior under President Hoover. At
that time he was greatly interested
in the American Indian problem,
and was initiated into the Pueblo
Tribe in gratitude for the work he
had done. They gave him the title
"Bearer of Light."
In 1933 he left Washington to re
sume his duties here at Stanford.
Just before he retired he was made
Chancellor of Stanford, the only man
besides David Starr Jordan to bear
that title.

I join with all sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red in ex
pressing congratulations and warm
regards to Chancellor Wilbur on
this, his 70th birthday. Evidences of
his wise, vigorous leadership are
to be seen throughout the Univer
sity. lie holds a high place in the
affections of Stanford people ev
erywhere.

He has always been an outdoor
man who liked to relax with a fish
ing rod. When he was still a stu
dent he paid part of his tuition by
collecting specimens for the natural
| history museum. As President of
| Stanford he sometimes traveled as
j far as Canada to fish or hunt. He
j set a new record at Lake Stuart in
J British Columbia the day he caught
a 33-inch rainbow trout weighing
20 pounds.
