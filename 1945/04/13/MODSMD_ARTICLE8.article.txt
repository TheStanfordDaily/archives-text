## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
"Five million dollars? Well, Jane,
I guess we can manage that much."

I With these words, in the face of bit- j
ter and determined opposition, Sen
ator Leland Stanford finally decided j
to see through the realization of his j
and his wife's one dream since the j
death of their son: that of founding j
i a university so that, as he said the j
1 morning of Leland, Jr.'s, death, "the j
j children of California will be our j
i children."
With these words, Dr. Donald B. j
Tresidder last night told a packed I
; audience of Stanford students in the |
Cubberley Education Auditorium the ;
; story of the founding of Stanford
University, and of the lives of its
: founders.
"We are all saddened by the
death of the President," he said,
opening his talk, "Jane Lathrop
and Leland Stanford: An Ameri
can Success Story," "and yet his
story is one of the many things
that have helped to make America
great."
Dr. Tresidder then told the story
of another American and his wife
who also contributed much to the
building of the country and of Cali- ,
i fornia.
Leland Stanford was born in 1824 j
in the Mohawk Valley, one of eight ;
children. Always enterprising, in
l dustrious, and frugal, he early made j
j a promising start in his chosen ea- j

reel* in law. He married Jane La
throp in 1850, and the couple lived in
Port Washington, Wisconsin, until a
fire swept the business district of
the town destroying all Stanford's
savings, his library, and his personal
belongings.
From there the Stanford story is
well known to all Stanford stu
dents. He came to California, alone
because his wife had to remain in
Albany to care for her ailing fa
' ther, and in nine years had saved
his first quarter of a million dol
lars.
He achieved national fame and
prominence, first as the promoter of
the Central Pacific Railroad, and In
ter as Governor and then Senator
| from California. As California's
Civil War Governor, he was instru
mental in keeping California in the
Union, in the face of a strong move
ment to make this state a separate
country.
The Stanfords' only son, Leland,
Jr., was horn in IXtiX. and he be
came the object around which
their lives were centered. Much
of young Leland's early life was
spent on the Stanfords' Palo Alto
Farm, and he grew to love it dear
ly. When he died in IXBI. his par
ents resolved to build a university
in his name.

ly. When he died in IXBI. his par
ents resolved to build a university
in his name.
"Five million dollars? Well, Jane,
I guess we can manage that much."

I With these words, in the face of bit- j
ter and determined opposition, Sen
ator Leland Stanford finally decided j
to see through the realization of his j
and his wife's one dream since the j
death of their son: that of founding j
i a university so that, as he said the j
1 morning of Leland, Jr.'s, death, "the j
j children of California will be our j
i children."
With these words, Dr. Donald B. j
Tresidder last night told a packed I
; audience of Stanford students in the |
Cubberley Education Auditorium the ;
; story of the founding of Stanford
University, and of the lives of its
: founders.
"We are all saddened by the
death of the President," he said,
opening his talk, "Jane Lathrop
and Leland Stanford: An Ameri
can Success Story," "and yet his
story is one of the many things
that have helped to make America
great."
Dr. Tresidder then told the story
of another American and his wife
who also contributed much to the
building of the country and of Cali- ,
i fornia.
Leland Stanford was born in 1824 j
in the Mohawk Valley, one of eight ;
children. Always enterprising, in
l dustrious, and frugal, he early made j
j a promising start in his chosen ea- j

reel* in law. He married Jane La
throp in 1850, and the couple lived in
Port Washington, Wisconsin, until a
fire swept the business district of
the town destroying all Stanford's
savings, his library, and his personal
belongings.
From there the Stanford story is
well known to all Stanford stu
dents. He came to California, alone
because his wife had to remain in
Albany to care for her ailing fa
' ther, and in nine years had saved
his first quarter of a million dol
lars.
He achieved national fame and
prominence, first as the promoter of
the Central Pacific Railroad, and In
ter as Governor and then Senator
| from California. As California's
Civil War Governor, he was instru
mental in keeping California in the
Union, in the face of a strong move
ment to make this state a separate
country.
The Stanfords' only son, Leland,
Jr., was horn in IXtiX. and he be
came the object around which
their lives were centered. Much
of young Leland's early life was
spent on the Stanfords' Palo Alto
Farm, and he grew to love it dear
ly. When he died in IXBI. his par
ents resolved to build a university
in his name.
