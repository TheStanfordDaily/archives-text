## 
### 
The Women's Gym will be decor
ated with a large maypole in the
center with streamers across the
ceiling on Saturday, April 28, from
8:30 to 12 p.m. when the girls of
Lagunita and Union Unit present
their Spring Fantasy formal.
There will also be large crepe
paper flowers and butterflies and
park benches throughout the gym,
according to Carol Torresen, decora

the band house to give the effect of
a concert in the park.
Tickets for the dance will go on

week before the dance, at $2.40
per couple. A number of them will
be reserved for Lagunita and Un
ion girls so that all who want them
will be able to get them.
Any Lagunita or Union girls
wishing blind dates should call An
nette Gattuccio, 9043 (Union), or
Nancy Hand (Lagunita) before to
morrow night. The dates will be
from Del Monte or Treasure Island
and are definitely assured.
Bert Whiting and his orchestra
from Menlo Park will play for the
dance. Jackie Boucher (Union), and
Nancy Pennycook (Lagunita) are
co-chairmen.
