# Truman and the Liberals
## A 						PRAYER 
### 
For first week in a long time the United
States proceeds in its history-making routine,
with a new President.
It seems that no one in the nation is hoping
harder and with more real anxiety than Harry
Truman that all will go well. There is, of
course, the binding tie made by the people for
the policies of President Roosevelt, endorsed
in the 1944 elections. President Truman has
already acknowledged this in his "no change,
no lag" pledge.
It is clear however that Truman himself, by
reason of his own selection as Vice-President,
represented a kind gesture toward the conserva
tive elements in the Democratic party.
Also the headship of the Senate now falls
to Mr. Kenneth McKellar, who, with other long
hyper-conservative Congressmen, not long ago
pledged himself to a crippling revision of Bret
ton Woods.
We do not mean to sound sour grapes, but
neither can we deny that there are more clouds
on the horizon than there were a few days ago.
As long as Franklin Roosevelt was alive,
complicated problems with historical seeds
were easily personified for the great masses
of people. But now they are only words
called "liberal" or "Red," depending on how
your sympathies lie; and the struggle of those
who call themselves "liberal" and believers
in a future of world participation is like the
task of pushing from the bottom a snowball
that was half-way up a hill.
It seems clear that a definite effort will be
made to pursue the Roosevelt policies and
agreements to a successful end. Certainly the
job will probably be more difficult without the
intimate knowledge of the conditions with
which the President has dealt. As the president
of Harvard has said, this tragedy is of such
magnitude as to render trivial all expressions
of grief and homage.
With Truman himself, more or less, owing
his position to some of the most reactionary
elements in the party, it will require courage
and strength on his part to pursue the late
Piesident's liberal, internationalist policies with
vigor. We plead and pray that this may be
done.
