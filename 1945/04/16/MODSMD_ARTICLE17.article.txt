# Flop or First Step
## SOCIAL PROGRAM 
### 
From three days of alphabetized, super-or
janized women's social program come reports
hat there was a lack of interest, occasionally
so pronounced as to border on discourtesy,
ihioughout the whole prodcedure, and that
:ew freshman women ventured curiously from
.toble, Ventura, and Bratnner's halls to see the
est of the campus living groups.
Not as discouraging at second glance, the

program did serve its avowed purpose of at
least giving the freshman women a chance to
look around, however disappointing it seemed
to those residences who expected a large-scale
get-together. The real responsibility begins
now of initiating friendly, easy social functions
to acquaint the freshmen with the persons who
lived inside those shined-up rooms they vis
ited this week-end.
Exchange desserts, Sunday non-invitational
open houses, tournaments, coffee-and-dough
nuts after a baseball game—these are the ways
in which both non-freshman residences and
units within the freshman halls can take over
this program on an individual basis.
Without the somewhat stifling influence that
too much organization has on informal enter
taining, campus women should start thinking
now of the best way to meet and know the
freshman who'll be the new girl two doors down
the hall next autumn.—N. S.
