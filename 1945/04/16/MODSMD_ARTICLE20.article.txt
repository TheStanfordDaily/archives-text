News dispatches tell us that the battle of Okinawa is,
at present, a heavy artillery duel. This is good for us,
because we have uninterrupted supply lines to the is
land, and we have good reason to believe that the Jap
anese do not. Our navy controls the waters around
the island.
The tonnage of shells necessary to keep the big
guns firing is something tremendous. In even suclv a
small scale fight as Okinawa, it undoubtedly runs into
at least five figures a day. In addition, we have support
from 16-inch high velocity naval batteries, while the
best the Japanese might have to offer in opposition are
6 and 8-inch pieces of much less muzzle velocity.
The Japanese garrison undoubtedly sees the hand
writing on the wall. It has so far launched a group of
counterattacks in light strength, all of which have been
abortive.
These have been on both the northern and southern
sectors of the island front. Those in the north are prob
ably merely an attempt to feel out our lines in the
hope that a weak point can be found, where the enemy
can launch a major effort, and in order to make vis think
twice before maneuvering our infantry under cover of
of barrage. The fact that all thrusts have been turned
back with dispatch shows that they have at least failed
in the first of the two endeavors.
Those in the south, on the other hand, arc the product
of the desperation of part of the garrison cut off by
our rapid march across the island. This enemy force
is probably trying to break out and try to get in touch
with the main enemy units up north, but their attempt
is gaining them nothing but high casualty lists. Once
we have won the artillery fight, however, our infantry
will launch a general attack in the north. Our troops
in the south simply have to keep the Japanese con
tained until the enemy starves to death.
Our casualties in the north will depend on how well
enemy works can stand up under our massed batteries.
As things are going now, the battle might be like some
of the earlier ones of the World War when, "the artil
lery conquered, the infantry occupied."
