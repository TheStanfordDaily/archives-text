# Buck Shaw To Coach at Cal
## 
### 
Will wonders never cease? Cal
not only fired Stub Allison, as of
last week, but then did a second
"impossible" thing; they hired, in
his stead, Buck Shaw, ex of Santa
Clara. Without a doubt, Shaw was
the most sought-after coach in the
nation in the past few years. UCLA
wanted him; numerous eastern col
leges wanted him; and Tony Mor
-bito, of San Francisco, got him.
Shaw stated that he would coach
the new professional team that is to
organized after the war in San Fran
cisco. That is why he did not accept
any college offers. But, when U.C.
asked for him, he changed his mind
a wee-bit and said that he would
help out over at Berkeley until the
professional deal goes through.
This might mean that he will
coach over at Cal for a few years.
It might also mean that Buck Shaw
will enjoy Cal so much that as far
as he is concerned the professional
deal never goes through. All this
remains to be seen.
