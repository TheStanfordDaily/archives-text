Franz von Papen
When World War I broke out in
July, 1914, Captain Franz von Papen
was German military attache in !
Washington. He was also, secretly, '
head of the German secret service |
in the United States and the insti-
gator of the sabotage activities, such j
as fires and other destruction in war j
implement plants in the United j
States, which raged through this |
country in 1914 and 1915.
Von Papen's activities came to
light when James /-uohibald. an |
"American newspaper : " embarked
on his return voyage to Berlin and j
Vienna as foreign war correspondent I
in August, 1915. Just prior to his >
departure he had been wined and j
dined by Dr. Dumba, Austrian am- j
bassador to the United States, and |
Captain von Papen. They asked him i
to be good enough to take some J
papers for them to Berlin and Vi- j
! enna. Just before his sailing a hol
low cane filled with documents and
a fat package, were delivered to
, Archibald.
Archibald Arrested
However, British secret service
had been warned and Archibald was
arrested when he entered British '
waters. Among the papers was a J
plan for complete disorganization of |
the Bethlehem Steel Works. The I
papers were published first in Eng- '
land and then in the United States ,
and the recall of Dumba and von
Papen was demanded by the United 1
States government. Von Papen leftj
the United States in December. 1915, '
accompanied by Captain Boy-Ed,
German naval attache who had also '
been active in the sabotage plots.
In 1932 von Papen became chan
cellor of the German reich and in i
that capacity served as head of the ,
German delegation to the Lausanne
Conference. When he became chan
cellor Germans were startled to see
the headlines in the foreign press:
"Ex-war Spy Becomes German |
Chancellor."
Agreement Opposed
At the Lausanne Conference von
Papen succeeded in convincing the
powers concerned, Great Britain.
Belgium, France, Italy and Japan,
that Germany must be helped or
i she would go under. The Lausanne
I Agreement completely put an end to.
and substituted for the reparations
1 regime, promises on the pan of
I Germany to pay a" definite sum at

some future date but with no penal
ties attached if she did not do so.
Even this agreement met with vio
lent opposition from the Nazi party
in Germany and Hitler announced,
"in three weeks time the Lausanne
Agreement will not be worth three
marks."
The agreement was signed July 9,
I 1932, and Hitler, succeeding von
| Papen. became chancellor of the
1 German reich on January 30, 1933.

In 1934 when Hitler determined 1
j to annex Russia he sent von Papen
I to Vienna as German ambassador to
! Austria. When World War II was
about to break Hitler sent von Papen |
! as ambassador to Turkey to insure '
1 that country's adhesion to the Axis
! cause, or its neutrality. In July, '
! 1944, just prior to the break be
j tween Turkey and the Axis powers,
| von Papen left Turkey and returned !
I to Germany.
