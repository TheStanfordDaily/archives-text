# Professors Debate Peace Conference
## Danger to Peace In Power Politics 
### 
Possible dangers within the frame
work of the United Nations Confer
ence, opening in San Francisco in
nine days, are the power politics
which could be employed by the
sponsor nations, and secrecy of de
bate behind the muflled doors of
the four or five major commissions
performing the conference's work.
So said Albert Guerard, professor
of general literature, in the Stanford
panel discussion heard over radio
station KYA from 2 to 3 yesterday
afternoon.
In the absence of University Pres
ident Donald B. Tresidder, Dr. Har
old Fisher acted as mediator for the
discussion on the Who, How, What,
and Why of the conference, in which
Stanford Professor* Thomas Bailey,
Philip Buck, and Felix Keesing, and
Harry B. Reynolds, Class of '96, par
ticipated.
"The big and small feet'' under the
conference table should not be too
rigidly classified, according to Pro
fessor Guerard; there should be a
finer gradation between those called
"important" and those that are not.
The smaller nations are important,
said Professor Keesing, for this is
primarily their conference. At Dum
barton Oaks, the sponsor nations
made plans for their future relation
ships and actions, but this is the first
opportunity for most of the other
nations to do so.

The bigness of the "Big Five" is
a corollary to power politics, accord
ing to Mr. Reynolds; the smaller
nations look to those that have tak
en the leadership in this war for
their rights and protection.
Dr. Guerard's argument that se
cret debate is never wholly secret,
that it guarantees nothing, but en
courages a lack of faith, was an
swered by Mr. Bailey, who said that
the objects of debate if made pub
lic would be enlarged upon by a
sensationalist press, making inform
ed discussion seem like a battle
royal.
Why the conference? To draft a
charter for the organization of the
United Nations into an effective body
for international cooperation. In its
functions, it resembles most the com
mission for drawing up the League
of Nations; its purpose, however, is
not to create a super-state but one
in which the individual member na
tions meet as equal and sovereign
states.
The desire on the part of the peo
ple for an "international bill of
rights" was pointed out by Profes
sor Keesing. who supposed that the

conference would write such a bill
into ihe charter.
That the conference is to be lo
cated in San Francisco is indication
of the shifting of the world's eco
nomic and commercial focus to the
Pacific, according to Professor Kees
ing. Mr. Bailey noted that holding
the conference in the United States
was a silent commitment on our
part to active participation in the
peace, not the isolationism.
Who will attend the conference?
The 44 nations that declare war up
on one or more of the Axis nations
before March 1. Satellite nations of
the Axis powers have not been in
vited. but these as well as Germany
and Japan may become members of
United Nations if their future con
duct makes them eligible.

bate behind the muflled doors of
the four or five major commissions
performing the conference's work.
So said Albert Guerard, professor
of general literature, in the Stanford
panel discussion heard over radio
station KYA from 2 to 3 yesterday
afternoon.
In the absence of University Pres
ident Donald B. Tresidder, Dr. Har
old Fisher acted as mediator for the
discussion on the Who, How, What,
and Why of the conference, in which
Stanford Professor* Thomas Bailey,
Philip Buck, and Felix Keesing, and
Harry B. Reynolds, Class of '96, par
ticipated.
"The big and small feet'' under the
conference table should not be too
rigidly classified, according to Pro
fessor Guerard; there should be a
finer gradation between those called
"important" and those that are not.
The smaller nations are important,
said Professor Keesing, for this is
primarily their conference. At Dum
barton Oaks, the sponsor nations
made plans for their future relation
ships and actions, but this is the first
opportunity for most of the other
nations to do so.

The bigness of the "Big Five" is
a corollary to power politics, accord
ing to Mr. Reynolds; the smaller
nations look to those that have tak
en the leadership in this war for
their rights and protection.
Dr. Guerard's argument that se
cret debate is never wholly secret,
that it guarantees nothing, but en
courages a lack of faith, was an
swered by Mr. Bailey, who said that
the objects of debate if made pub
lic would be enlarged upon by a
sensationalist press, making inform
ed discussion seem like a battle
royal.
Why the conference? To draft a
charter for the organization of the
United Nations into an effective body
for international cooperation. In its
functions, it resembles most the com
mission for drawing up the League
of Nations; its purpose, however, is
not to create a super-state but one
in which the individual member na
tions meet as equal and sovereign
states.
The desire on the part of the peo
ple for an "international bill of
rights" was pointed out by Profes
sor Keesing. who supposed that the

conference would write such a bill
into ihe charter.
That the conference is to be lo
cated in San Francisco is indication
of the shifting of the world's eco
nomic and commercial focus to the
Pacific, according to Professor Kees
ing. Mr. Bailey noted that holding
the conference in the United States
was a silent commitment on our
part to active participation in the
peace, not the isolationism.
Who will attend the conference?
The 44 nations that declare war up
on one or more of the Axis nations
before March 1. Satellite nations of
the Axis powers have not been in
vited. but these as well as Germany
and Japan may become members of
United Nations if their future con
duct makes them eligible.
