# CONFERENCE
## 'Back to Farm' Dance Planned 
### 
"Back to the Farm" will be the
theme for the Con Home dance to be
given Saturday night under the
sponsorship of Women's Conference.
It will be a jeans and gingham
dance, although any costume suitable
for a farm will be in order with the
theme of the dance, according to
Ruth Maxwell, general chairman.
Tickets will probably be sold at
the door at $1 per couple including
tax. Proceeds will go to the Con
Home. Cokes will be sold and music
will be from records of the name
bands.
Committee chairmen are:
Marjorie Dwyer, arrangements;
Carol Atkinson, entertainment; Joey
Nell Ryan, publicity; Margaret Wade,
decorations and lighting; Charmian
Kolar, patrons; Jean Gait, clean-up;
and Helen Frost, food.
Bill Gilbert explained Article Ten
of the Constitution which was re
cently clarified by Excom. The Honor
Code applies only to academic work
and the violation of rules of the li
brary. Women's social regulations
are a part of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Pam Strathairn, chairman of Wo
men's Conference, announced that
the scholastic report for winter quar
ter was about the same as fall quar
ter and that both were very low.
Winter quarter is usually a quarter
of high grade averages because of
poorweather. Miss Strathairn urged
house presidents to devise some sys
tem in their houses to bring up the
grade averages.
There is a shortage of workers in
the Cellar at night, and the ones who
now work at this time are mostly
freshmen.
It is felt that freshmen should not
have to be depended upon to keep
the Cellar open. Hashers' hours are
from 9 to 11 p.m. on either two or
four nights each week and they re
ceive 60 cents per hour. Anyone in
terested should call Alice Tuttle at
22151.
Patty Patten, Women's Council
member, said that students who get
look-outs on 2 a.m. late leaves will
be referred directly to Women's
Council for the violation.
Suggestion was made that the Row
houses be organized into a unit so
they can operate as a large group
like Union Unit when necessary.
This would facilitate the housing
program and would benefit the
houses financially, especially in
sponsoring large affairs.

Patty Patten, Women's Council
member, said that students who get
look-outs on 2 a.m. late leaves will
be referred directly to Women's
Council for the violation.
Suggestion was made that the Row
houses be organized into a unit so
they can operate as a large group
like Union Unit when necessary.
This would facilitate the housing
program and would benefit the
houses financially, especially in
sponsoring large affairs.
"Back to the Farm" will be the
theme for the Con Home dance to be
given Saturday night under the
sponsorship of Women's Conference.
It will be a jeans and gingham
dance, although any costume suitable
for a farm will be in order with the
theme of the dance, according to
Ruth Maxwell, general chairman.
Tickets will probably be sold at
the door at $1 per couple including
tax. Proceeds will go to the Con
Home. Cokes will be sold and music
will be from records of the name
bands.
Committee chairmen are:
Marjorie Dwyer, arrangements;
Carol Atkinson, entertainment; Joey
Nell Ryan, publicity; Margaret Wade,
decorations and lighting; Charmian
Kolar, patrons; Jean Gait, clean-up;
and Helen Frost, food.

Pam Strathairn, chairman of Wo
men's Conference, announced that
the scholastic report for winter quar
ter was about the same as fall quar
ter and that both were very low.
Winter quarter is usually a quarter
of high grade averages because of
poorweather. Miss Strathairn urged
house presidents to devise some sys
tem in their houses to bring up the
grade averages.
There is a shortage of workers in
the Cellar at night, and the ones who
now work at this time are mostly
freshmen.
It is felt that freshmen should not
have to be depended upon to keep
the Cellar open. Hashers' hours are
from 9 to 11 p.m. on either two or
four nights each week and they re
ceive 60 cents per hour. Anyone in
terested should call Alice Tuttle at
22151.
