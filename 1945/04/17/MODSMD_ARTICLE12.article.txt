# MEN TO WATCH
## 
### 
The Congress of the United States stands to
day as one of the most important and powerful
bodies in the world —a small group of half-blind
folded though well-informed, fumbling though
aspiring Americans. These are the men to
watch, for they will make our decisions for us
in the probable wrangling to come over the
plans formed at Dumbarton Oaks which may
be ratified at San Francisco this month.
Before the Congressional discussion begins
on its way history-ward, a few stumbling blocks
should be whittled down to stepping-stone size
that lie in the path of any real effort to bulwark
world security.
The first of these to combat will be a lack of
vision on the part of some legislators, predic
table from proposals like the revival of imperial
ism through the cheap, power-backed acquisi
tions of several foreign-owned islands. Men
who fail to see the implications of such pro
posals can't be expected to recognize the worth
of direct United States government loans to na
tions attempting reconstruction in the post-war
era, the Export-Import Bank, lower tariffs to in
crease foreign trade, and any of the Bretton
Woods plans for economic security. They
haven't yet discovered that the United States,
as the established world leader, must make
some concessions, even sacrifices, for the high
er goal of permanent peace.
Among the legislators we can also spot a
tendency to carry over their traditional vote
sv/apping into the field of post-war planning.
Pressed to get favorable action by Congress on
important foreign policies, some leaders may
give in too easily to those who demand con
cessions on domestic issues which are equally
essential to the peace.
Another stumbling block is the closed mind,
a bugaboo which arises almost automatically in
persons who must formulate plans by modify
ing and discarding—husking possibilities. Top
government officials develop a confidence in
their own judgment through the constant use
of this mental sorting process that may stand
opposed to suggested changes in the world se
curity plan, whether proposed by Congress or
by the United Nations.
These are the things that we will be looking
for when members of the Senate and the House
*
gather to act upon these issues. They can be
warning signals that will help us in keeping on
the straight road to what we want for the future,
in avoiding the old meandering trails we fol
lowed from 1918 to 1941.— N. S.

The Congress of the United States stands to
day as one of the most important and powerful
bodies in the world —a small group of half-blind
folded though well-informed, fumbling though
aspiring Americans. These are the men to
watch, for they will make our decisions for us
in the probable wrangling to come over the
plans formed at Dumbarton Oaks which may
be ratified at San Francisco this month.
Before the Congressional discussion begins
on its way history-ward, a few stumbling blocks
should be whittled down to stepping-stone size
that lie in the path of any real effort to bulwark
world security.
The first of these to combat will be a lack of
vision on the part of some legislators, predic
table from proposals like the revival of imperial
ism through the cheap, power-backed acquisi
tions of several foreign-owned islands. Men
who fail to see the implications of such pro
posals can't be expected to recognize the worth
of direct United States government loans to na
tions attempting reconstruction in the post-war
era, the Export-Import Bank, lower tariffs to in
crease foreign trade, and any of the Bretton
Woods plans for economic security. They
haven't yet discovered that the United States,
as the established world leader, must make
some concessions, even sacrifices, for the high
er goal of permanent peace.
Among the legislators we can also spot a
tendency to carry over their traditional vote
sv/apping into the field of post-war planning.
Pressed to get favorable action by Congress on
important foreign policies, some leaders may
give in too easily to those who demand con
cessions on domestic issues which are equally
essential to the peace.
Another stumbling block is the closed mind,
a bugaboo which arises almost automatically in
persons who must formulate plans by modify
ing and discarding—husking possibilities. Top
government officials develop a confidence in
their own judgment through the constant use
of this mental sorting process that may stand
