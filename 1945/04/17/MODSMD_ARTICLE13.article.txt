# Seen from an Ivory Tower

To appreciate fhe saying that nothing unites people
is much as does adversity shared in common, one has
>nly to ravel by the milktrain from Los Angeles to
P;ilo Alto.
The unwary traveler who goes to the ticket office in

Los Angeles is smoothly sold a coach reservation on this
train with an alacrity that a more experienced man
would find suspicious.
The physical appearance of the train yields the first
hint that the whole design is the railway company's
passionate protest against war-time travel. Although
the train has to travel throughout the night, no Pull
mans are provided; no pillows are to be obtained for
rent; no luxuries grace the bleak antiquity of the
coaches.
There is no doubt that our Victorian ancestors had
corporal frames very difVerent in plan from those of
the present day. Apparently they were most com
fortable when sitting bolt upright, their arms rigidly
extended, their shoulders squared and with a huge
unyielding mass of plus placed at the back of the
head, pushing it forward till chin meets breastbone.
As this tribute to the force of sadism speeds on its
slovenly way, the passengers are to discover further
acts of thoughtfulness in its construction. Dashing with
maniac haste into a long tunnel, the engine expels
quantities of noxious gases that are speedily swept into
the coaches by devices attached for the purpose. To
prolong the agony of the helpless victims trapped inside
the coaches, the engine now dawdles, now comes to a
full stop, and now begins a maddening series of back
wards and forwards shuttles, all in the dark bowels
of the earth.
Goodbye, Brother Sun. It is sad to think that I
shall not see your face again, that I am fated to ex
pire of sulfide and hydrocarbon vapors, choked to
death by a super-patriotic railway company.
Suddenly the coach bursts into the daylight. Outside,
the sun is shining on the green fields, a stiff breeze
tosses the grain in golden waves; inside, the red-eyed
victims cannot see across the coach because of steam,
fumes and fog.
The common d'stress of the passengers has by now
united them in at least one strong sentiment of hatred.
Remarks, varying in nature with the temperatment of
the speaker but varying little in their general tenor,
are exchanged and soon acquaintanceship is strength
ened to a feeling of friendship and brotherhood.
Hacking coughs, streaming eyes, and other signs
of physical distress that generally cause only feel
ings of disgust in the beholder, are now seen with
sympathy as tokens of the villainy of railway com
panies, the stupidity of engineers and the particular
harshness of Fate towards all the passengers on the
train.
In the same way the esprit de corps of a battalion can
be formed by the process known in the Army as "grip
ing." The men are united in at least one respect. Sym
pathy for an individual is engendered when his mis
fortune is seen to be one to which all are liable, and ef
forts are made to assist him to the extent that his com
rades hope the same efforts would be expended on their
behalf. •
