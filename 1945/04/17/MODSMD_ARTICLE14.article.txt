TRUMAN'S SPEECH
President Truman laid down a definite policy in his
speech yesterday. It is impossible to doubt what he
stands for in international affairs, but he did not men
tion domestic policy.
He came out for an international organization "sub
stituting law or force in international relations," and he
also made the point that "the role of the big nations is
not to dominate but to serve the world." ''America,' 1 he
said as a corollary, "has attained a leadership based
not entirely on its military or naval strength.'"
The concept of law being the dominant force in the
new international organization is actually something
new. The previous idea seemed to be a cooperative use
of armed, economic, and diplomatic intervention to put
down aggression, coupled with vague statements of an
attempt to get to the financial roots of war.
Moreover, this will be somewhat tedious to get over. I
since it subordinates the member to the organiaztion, ;
and not vice versa.
CONTROVERSIAL "FREE TRADE"
This, coupled with the statment that "there must be !
free trading amongst nations in order to accomplish 1
fuller employment and greater mutual prosperity," are j
the most potentially controversial points of the whole ;
oration.
He probably wouldn't have said them if he hadn't
meant them, and if this is your philosophy towards the
postwar world, you may well be sure that the new
President will fight for it.
As a matter of fact, President TrUman's Senate rec
ord, coupled with this speech, tends to show him as a j
very honest and determined man. He is also practical, j
as the logical order and concrete points of his speech i
today showed. Finally, the whole Congress seems to be i
behind him. and this will no doubt help his foreign pol
icy.
KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS
He lacks many of the fine qualities of the late Presi
dent, such as Mr. Roosevelt's great suaveness and di
plomancy, but he seems to know what he wants in in
ternational affairs.
A test on domestic affairs, however, has not come up.
He also might lack Mr. Roosevelt's gland quality of
harmonizing discordant elements, but the record of the
Truman Committee shows that he can do the next best
thing, namely keep people in their own places.
He seems, so far, to have risen veil to his office.

stands for in international affairs, but he did not men
tion domestic policy.
He came out for an international organization "sub
stituting law or force in international relations," and he
also made the point that "the role of the big nations is
not to dominate but to serve the world." ''America,' 1 he
said as a corollary, "has attained a leadership based
not entirely on its military or naval strength.'"
The concept of law being the dominant force in the
new international organization is actually something
new. The previous idea seemed to be a cooperative use
of armed, economic, and diplomatic intervention to put
down aggression, coupled with vague statements of an
attempt to get to the financial roots of war.
Moreover, this will be somewhat tedious to get over. I
since it subordinates the member to the organiaztion, ;
and not vice versa.
CONTROVERSIAL "FREE TRADE"
This, coupled with the statment that "there must be !
free trading amongst nations in order to accomplish 1
fuller employment and greater mutual prosperity," are j
the most potentially controversial points of the whole ;
oration.
He probably wouldn't have said them if he hadn't
meant them, and if this is your philosophy towards the
postwar world, you may well be sure that the new
President will fight for it.
As a matter of fact, President TrUman's Senate rec
ord, coupled with this speech, tends to show him as a j
very honest and determined man. He is also practical, j
as the logical order and concrete points of his speech i
today showed. Finally, the whole Congress seems to be i
behind him. and this will no doubt help his foreign pol
icy.
KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS
He lacks many of the fine qualities of the late Presi
dent, such as Mr. Roosevelt's great suaveness and di
plomancy, but he seems to know what he wants in in
ternational affairs.
A test on domestic affairs, however, has not come up.
He also might lack Mr. Roosevelt's gland quality of
harmonizing discordant elements, but the record of the
Truman Committee shows that he can do the next best
thing, namely keep people in their own places.
He seems, so far, to have risen veil to his office.
