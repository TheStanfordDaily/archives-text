In the April 17 Look magazine,
Barbara Jo Allen, alias Vera Vague,
has a half-page biography of her
rise to fame. We note this fact be
cause Barbara Jo, now Mrs. Norman
Morrell, was once a Stanford stu
dent.
Formerly a model in New York,
Mrs. Morrell preferred to go on the
stage, but ended in a compromise
by entering radio work. Her fame as
Vera Vague spread until she finally
joined the Bob Hope show. Tuesday
nights, NBC, under the sponsorship
of Pepsodent toothpaste, containing
irium. She appeared on Hope
program two years ago after having
acted in Jack Carson's Signal Carni
val and the Rudy Vallee and Char
lie McCarthy shows.
Despite Bob Hope, her fame as
the man-hunter of the ether reached
new heights. She has played at many
Army camps with Hope and made
several movies, such as "Girl Crazy"
and "Lake Placid Serenade."
Although Vera Vague's radio au
dience thinks of this comedienne as
an ugly duckling, capitalizing on her
wit and voice, she is actually a pret
ty, quiet-spoken wife and mother in
real life. Of interest to the male
minority here at Stanford is the fact
that Mrs. Morrell has a 15-year uld
daughter who seems to be following
in her mother's footsteps when she
says:"I try to keep my mother's
radio activity as quiet as possible."
