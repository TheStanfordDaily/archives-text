# You Swing, They Sting--
## 
### 
Intermediate golfers MW2 were
contentedly swinging their clubs and
sending the white balls in beautiful
arcs yesterday afternoon at 2:45 p.m.
They were most happily engaged in
improving their driving form on the
hockey field when a few bees began
buzzing over iheir heads.
What are a few bees to a golfer
used to communing with nature in
all its manifestations â€”including poi
son oak? So, ignoring the increasing
horde of droning injects, they playeci
on until Mrs. Cain said, "Don't
move." And nine girls froze (if one
can freeze at 80 F.)
A few thousand hornets played "in
and out the window" for ten minutes
while ten persons thought of ten
other places where they would rath
er be. Hovering distractedly over the
girls, the hornets cast a black shadow
on the grass. One flash of a golf
club and ten unhappy golfers would
have rushed for the nearby stream.
The hornets chose for their home
the tall tree by the road, on the
corner of Santa Teresa street and
Governor's lane. And for all we
know they may be there yet, terri
fying venturesome crows.
