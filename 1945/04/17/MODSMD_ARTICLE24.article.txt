There are now 50 per cent more college students in China than at the start
of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, according to Dr.,Pen-Tung Sub. president
of the National University of Amoy. Seventy thousand students are now at
tending institutions of higher learning, compared with 47,000 before the war.
In a discussion of Chinese Education at the International Club Sunday

evening, Dr. Sah also pointed out
that Chinese universities are able to
provide an education for only a small
number of those who would like to
go to college. He said that the vo
cational training schools are espe
cially in need of equipment and per
sonnel.
China's first '"five year plan" suc
ceeded in lowering the rate of il
literacy from 80 per cent to 60 per
cent,, and in five more years will re
duce it to only 40 per cent. The pro
gram is administered both by teach
ing in grade schools and adult edu
cation centers, said Dr. Sah. He also
stated that 80 per cent of the Chi
nese children can now be accomo
dated in public grade schools, with
education for all possible within the
next few years.
During a brief discussion of Chi
nese political problems, the guest
speaker urged those present not to
place too much confidence on the re
ports of Americans who return from
China after short visits and claim to
know all about the situation, as the
problem is much too complex to be
analyzed so quickly.
