# 'Tonight' Has Blackout Plot
## 
### 
"Tonight and Every Night" is just
another musical with just another
black-out plot—nothing worth wast-

ing a late-leave
on, but good re
laxation.
* Rita Hayworth,
as the dancer in
London with an
> American troupe,
i has a few new
routines and cos
tumes, but in
general her tac
tics ard the same
•subtle bomb

shells.
The only bright point in the pic
ture was Marc Piatt, formerly in the
"Oklahoma" cast. He did a marvel
ous job on both modern and classical
routines, with a maximum of leaps.
He was at his best when he danced
to a foreign radio speaker's voice.
On the whole, the plot was too
full of heavy British accents and
obvious chins-up attitudes. Lee
Bowman played the part of the RAF
pilot, who fell in love with the
American dancer, per usual, was sent
on a mission, per usual, and was
reported missing, per usual. Aha,
but he came back—also per usual—
and persuaded Hayworth to get de
cently dressed long enough to get
married.
Waste Basket Salvage
"Fashion Model," the second fea
ture now playing at the Stanford, is
either an international melerdram
er or a rejected screen test, which
escapcd from the studio's waste bas
ket.
Marjorie Weaver and Lee Bowman
may be blamed for the leads. As
for the story, it's just a pointless
network of poor acting, livened oc
casionally by a corpse. Each time
Weaver found a corpse, she raised
her hands expressively, and enun
ciated , "Look—Look!" slowly and
carefully. She was invariably an
swered by Bowman, who raised his
hands in the same way, and said.
"What—what!" in a way that would
plainly mean a flunk in Speech 9.—
