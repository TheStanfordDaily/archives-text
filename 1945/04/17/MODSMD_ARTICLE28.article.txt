WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP).â€”
President Truman promised Con
gress and the world in a fighting
speech today that the nation will
continue the war for freedom "until
no vestige of resistance remains."
"Our demand has been and it re
mains 'unconditional surrender'," he
told a joint session of Congress in
his first address as 32nd President.
And to Adlf Hitler and Axis lead
ers he gave the warning that they
will get their just deserts, that they
will not escape punishment by hid
ing out in some mountain retreat.
He promised no uarter for the en
emy; he warned them that "we will
not traffic with the breakers ,of the
peace on the terms of peace," and he
told Congress and his millions of ra
dio listeners "the grand strategy of
the war must go on under the able
direction of the present high com
mand.'"
