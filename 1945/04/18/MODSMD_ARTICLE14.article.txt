### 
Girls are very urgently needed to
work on posters for the clothing and
War Bond drives. Those who would
be interested and willing to work
should contact Beth van Hoesen at
The Redwoods or at the War Board
Since the system of war hours have
been abolished, posters are more
necessary than ever to call war work
to the attention of the students, said
Jeannette Grimsley, War Board co
ordinator.
