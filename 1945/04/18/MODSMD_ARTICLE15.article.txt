# Series Trio Varies Style
## 
### 
Last night's Tuesday Series con
cert trio with Ferenc Molnar on the
viola; Boris Blinder, violoncellist;
and Lev Shorr, pianist, opened in
traditional manner with J. S. Bach's
"Sonata in A Minor" for viola and
piano.
Other selections for the evening
included "Sonata in D Major" for
'cello and piano, by Anton Ruben -
stein; "Concertstuck" for viola and
piano, by Georges Enesco; and Bee
thoven's "Trio in B Major, Opus 11."
As an opening, the Bach sonata
proved only mediocre. Although the
steadiness and rigid tempo of Mr.
Shorr's piano was in true Bach style,
Mr. Molnar's viola was at times a bit
raspy. However, his technique in the
allegro was skillfully handled.
The outstanding number of the
evening was Rubenstein's "Sonata in
D Major." The singing quality of Mr.
Blinder's 'cello and the dramatic re
straint of Mr. Shorr's piano made for
a very effective presentation. The
precise rhythm and masterful tech
nique on the part of both musicians
was superb, while the poignancy and
the melancholy of the moderato lef:
the audience in complete approval
of Mr. Blinder's lovely tone.
Enesco's "Concertstuck" had the
typical qualities of his Rumanian
folk music. The tone of Mr. Mol
nar's viola was much improved in
this selection; his double stopi
against the background of piano ar
peggios, though difficult, were well
done.
The selections were well chosen
and proved interesting contrasts i:*.
