# A 						ROW UNIT
## 
### 
One lone item at the end of the Women s
Conference minutes of last Monday s meeting
interested us: (1) because of its importance in
the Housing Committee's present social pro
gram; (2) because nothing was definitely de
cided on the subject at Conference that day.
The point of contention is the proposal for a
Row organization, to be composed of an equal
number of representatives from each house on
the Row.
Opposition to such an organization or why
a definite decision was not made at the meet
ing is vague, but events of last week-end clearly
indicate the need of a method of communication
among Row houses; of a means of standardiza
tion of social policies and easy discussion and
exchange of ideas on the present social pro
gram and any particular problems that may
arise under the co-operative living system of
small units. At present there is no organization,
such as Union Unit or Lagunita excom, that has
Row support, except Women's Conference,
which is too large a body for consideration of
problems of Row houses as a separate living
unit.
Tentative Housing Committee plans call for
a permanent committee to guide the future pro
gram and policy of the new housing experi
ment. An equal number of women on that com
mittee from the freshman halls, Lagunita and
Union excoms, and the Row unit would pro
vide a compact, representative body for effi
cient and effective decisions.
Again the need for immediate action in a
troubled situation is important. Representatives
from Row houses—from all living units—should
have been together this week discussing last
week-end's social program and making sug
gestions for the improvement of plans and atti
tudes on both sides; offering constructive in
stead of negative criticism of a program that is
going to take a lot of time, patience, and good
feeling to be made effective.—H. D.
