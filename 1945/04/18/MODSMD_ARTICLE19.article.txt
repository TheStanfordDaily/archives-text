SPRING, THY STING IS EVERYWHERE

Well,. Old Sol has finally done it to us.
.atched onto the southwest corner of the Boat
louse and picked up his knitting, and keeps on
. aking so darn much shine around the place
hat you just can't see to read a book. Spring
ias come, one hundred proof.
Variety's the thing, all right. When the books
ail, you can always fall back (on the nearest

roof) in your next-to-nothings and absorb some
of this bottled-in-bond ultra-violet in the space
provided for that purpose on the form. (Life Can
Be Beautiful department.)
Of course, even life on a sun-porch has its
gimmicks. Gimmicks one to three are as fol
lows: (1) men in airplanes; (2) men out of air
planes; (3) bees. The first two gimmicks—(l)
and (2) —for ladies only. The rest of you girls
haven't a thing to worry about.
When it comes to airplanes, as it so often
does, you run right up against the United States
government. Our dollars and cents (plug) and
somebody else's muscle built those planes. And
they have to fly somewhere, don't they? Pic
ture the chagrin of the United States govern
ment at the mere idea of all that vacant air over
the Chi O sun porch going to waste. We just
haven't got the heart, have we, kids? We love
our government. (You big attractive govern
ment!)
When it comes to men (once in a while), we
have the guestion of thy neighbor—to love or
not to love. Look at that poor parlor-pallid
neighbor, hitting the books day after day (ex
cept the days when they hit back), glued to his
desk with a pair of binoculars. Math majors in
the grip of solid geometry have been known to
crack up on nothing but angles. You wouldn't
grudge them a few old curves, would you? A
few old curves in a Mabs original with dainty
appligue of telephone number. (Hi, neighbor!)
But bees now. I feel pretty deeply about
bees. Come to find out, bees feel pretty deeply
about me. (Hit 'er again, hit 'er again, hahdah,
hahdah!) After a period of intensive research on
the Manzan sun porch (I got there first but they
lasted longer), I offer the following Helpful
Hints to the Half-baked, or My Ten Rounds with
Hymenoptera, superfamily Apoidera. "Was you
ever bit "If you wasn't, follow these simple
directions and see how you like it.
1. When you see a bee, don't move. He can
move faster than you can.
2. Hand me down that bottle of Skol. Bees
go for girls who wear Skol. In fact, bees go for
Skol. (It ain't bad.)
3. Don't light that cigarette. Bees will walk
a mile for a whiff of a Camel. (Who won't?)
4. Walk, do not run, to the nearest entrance.
Even bees are afraid to go into a women's resi
dence unescorted.
4. Speak gently to the bee. He won't under
stand you anyway.
5. Bite him back.

1. When you see a bee, don't move. He can
move faster than you can.
2. Hand me down that bottle of Skol. Bees
go for girls who wear Skol. In fact, bees go for
Skol. (It ain't bad.)
3. Don't light that cigarette. Bees will walk
a mile for a whiff of a Camel. (Who won't?)
4. Walk, do not run, to the nearest entrance.
Even bees are afraid to go into a women's resi

4. Speak gently to the bee. He won't under
stand you anyway.
5. Bite him back.

louse and picked up his knitting, and keeps on

hat you just can't see to read a book. Spring
ias come, one hundred proof.
Variety's the thing, all right. When the books
ail, you can always fall back (on the nearest

roof) in your next-to-nothings and absorb some
of this bottled-in-bond ultra-violet in the space
provided for that purpose on the form. (Life Can
Be Beautiful department.)
Of course, even life on a sun-porch has its
gimmicks. Gimmicks one to three are as fol
lows: (1) men in airplanes; (2) men out of air
planes; (3) bees. The first two gimmicks—(l)
and (2) —for ladies only. The rest of you girls
haven't a thing to worry about.
When it comes to airplanes, as it so often
does, you run right up against the United States
government. Our dollars and cents (plug) and
somebody else's muscle built those planes. And
they have to fly somewhere, don't they? Pic

the Chi O sun porch going to waste. We just
haven't got the heart, have we, kids? We love
our government. (You big attractive govern

When it comes to men (once in a while), we
have the guestion of thy neighbor—to love or
not to love. Look at that poor parlor-pallid
neighbor, hitting the books day after day (ex
cept the days when they hit back), glued to his
desk with a pair of binoculars. Math majors in
the grip of solid geometry have been known to
crack up on nothing but angles. You wouldn't
grudge them a few old curves, would you? A
few old curves in a Mabs original with dainty
appligue of telephone number. (Hi, neighbor!)
But bees now. I feel pretty deeply about
bees. Come to find out, bees feel pretty deeply
about me. (Hit 'er again, hit 'er again, hahdah,
hahdah!) After a period of intensive research on
the Manzan sun porch (I got there first but they
