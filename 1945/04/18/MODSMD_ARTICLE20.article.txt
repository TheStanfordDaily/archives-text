Though President Roosevelt has died, the great work
he has done in furtherance of world unity his been
given new impetus by international realization that his
ideas are crucially important to the continued welfare
of civilization.
He understood world problems more profoundly than
other men of our times, and acted wisely to knit the
disorganized international society into essential eco
nomic and political unity.
Every people of the world, perhaps even some among
our enemies, are aware that he stood only for the wel
fare of humanity. In the truest sense he was an
American.
Many able men are left to carry on with his far
sighted efforts to create a society of nations. The re
sponsibility rests very much now on the shoulders of a
comparatively unknown man, President Truman. He.
too. is an American with an intense appreciation of
his predecessor and of the vital political and economic
concepts which he sought to establish in world society.
President Truman is an honest and capable leader
and will prove himself worthy of the task that has
fallen to him.
A brief hour after he became president he issued a
statement to the effect that the United Nations Con
ference would not be delayed by the calamitous death
of the late president. This act brought remarkable
prestige to the new president in the eyes of other peo
ples whose confidence was immediately assured.
He won a vital diplomatic victory when Premier
Stalin acceded to the president's request to send V. M.
Molotov as the head of the Russian delegation to the
United Nations Conference.
Foreign ministers of every other country were at
tending the conference to which Russia had been the
only exception.
As a result hopes of world leaders are rising that in
San francisco ancient dreams of a brotherhood of man
will become a simple and noble reality.
