# Hoffman Sparks Buchanan Win
## 
### BOB GILKEY 
Monroe and Phi Psi continued as
the class of the intramural softball
league by winning overwhelming
victories yesterday, but Buchanan
stayed in there with a thrilling 5-4
triumph over the Legal Eagles.
With the Eagles leading 4-3 in the
last of the sixth, Frank "Slugger"
Hoffman, Buchanan pitcher, pounded
a mighty homer to right center to
knot the count. Buchanan went on
to win in the seventh when the Eagle
left-fielder bobbled Sheldon Butt's
long fly to score the winning run.
Hoffman was definitely the big gun
in the Buchanan victory, slamming
out a homer and two singles in addi
tion to hurling the victory.
Monroe, paced by the fine twirling
of Joe Sher, crushed Tyler, 11-3, and
the strong Phi Psi ten toppled the
Flacs. 13-2. The Phi Psi's really went
to town in the fifth, exploding for
eight runs, including homers by Tom
Ashley and Luke Pitts, who also
pitched an excellent game for the
winners.
The coming game between Monroe
and Phi Psi should really be a clas
sic, since both clubs have excellent
pitching and plenty of power at the
plate.
