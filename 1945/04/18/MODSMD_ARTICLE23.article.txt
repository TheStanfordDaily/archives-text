starting out behind the lake over
Jaspers Ridge and down to the creek,
according to Mary Jane Bull, chair
man of the hikes.
Hikers will leave Roble at 1 p.m.
"This hike will be a little more
strenuous than the last one, so we
hope that the seasoned hikers will
come along and also those who
weren't able to accompany Dr. Tres
idder on the last hike," Miss Bull
