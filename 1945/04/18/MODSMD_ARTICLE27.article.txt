### KEN SCHUG 
"If the United States of America had joined the League of Nations and
had lived up to its obligations, Japan would never have succeeded in Man
churia," stated Dr. Tully C. Knoles, president of the College of the Pacific,
at the Palo Alto Forum on the San Francisco Conference Monday evening.
If we had done this, he added, the world would have been saved from the
present situation.
Dr. Knoles pointed out that the nine-power agreement in 1922 failed at

the time of the Manchuria invasion
because it did not guarantee, but !
merely respected, the integrity of
China. The fact that neither Russia j
nor the United States belonged to ;
he League and both wanted to in
crease their trade with Japan in 1931. J
made the League impotent to employ
economic sanctions against the ag
gressor Japan, said Dr. Knoles.
In beginning his talk. Dr. Knoles 1
commented on the tendency of the
American people, especialy the j
younger generation, to make broad
generalizations without bothering
to digest the facts or organize the
information at their disposal. A
striking example of this weakness
has been the many attempts to
trace all political and international
events of the past 25 years back to
the Treaty of Versailles, he said.
They must remember, he said, that
following the armistice of World
War I, the people of the world were
suffering from a severe war psycho
sis, and that the United States was
a participant in the making of the
:reaty. The failure of the Versailles
Treaty, he continued, was "pretty
nuch because the United States did
.lot ratify it."
Dr. Knoles then refuted some of
.he objections made to the Treaty
of Versailles by outlining the revi
sions made in the peace terms in
the years following the war. In 1926,
an impartial committee of scholars
published a report in London which
removed the judgment of complete
war guilt from Germany, he said.
This committee in an open report
stated that "Germany was not sole
ly responsible for the outbreak of the
war" at a time before we had ever
heard of Hitler, said Dr. Knoles.
On the question of reparations,
the speaker recalled that the
amount of reparation was reduced
from 132 billion dollars to 28 bil
lion, that Germany was not al
lowed to pay off in labor or goods,
and that the inflation of the Ger
man mark finally discredited the
German Republic and wiped out
a class in Germany which the
Junkers wanted wiped out. How
ever, said Dr. Knoles, the mora
torium on war debts called by
Presidcnt Hoover occurred before
the rise of the Nazi party to power
in Germany.
In concluding his discussion of the
Versailles Treaty, Dr. Knoles said
that "the Treaty of Versailles had
veiy little to do with the rise of
Hitler and his power."

merely respected, the integrity of
China. The fact that neither Russia j
nor the United States belonged to ;
he League and both wanted to in
crease their trade with Japan in 1931. J
made the League impotent to employ
economic sanctions against the ag
gressor Japan, said Dr. Knoles.
In beginning his talk. Dr. Knoles 1
commented on the tendency of the
American people, especialy the j
younger generation, to make broad
generalizations without bothering
to digest the facts or organize the
information at their disposal. A
striking example of this weakness
has been the many attempts to
trace all political and international
events of the past 25 years back to
the Treaty of Versailles, he said.
They must remember, he said, that
following the armistice of World
War I, the people of the world were
suffering from a severe war psycho
sis, and that the United States was
a participant in the making of the
:reaty. The failure of the Versailles
Treaty, he continued, was "pretty
nuch because the United States did
.lot ratify it."
Dr. Knoles then refuted some of
.he objections made to the Treaty
of Versailles by outlining the revi
sions made in the peace terms in
the years following the war. In 1926,
an impartial committee of scholars
published a report in London which
removed the judgment of complete
war guilt from Germany, he said.
This committee in an open report
stated that "Germany was not sole
ly responsible for the outbreak of the
war" at a time before we had ever
heard of Hitler, said Dr. Knoles.
On the question of reparations,
the speaker recalled that the
amount of reparation was reduced
from 132 billion dollars to 28 bil
lion, that Germany was not al
lowed to pay off in labor or goods,
and that the inflation of the Ger
man mark finally discredited the
German Republic and wiped out
a class in Germany which the
Junkers wanted wiped out. How
ever, said Dr. Knoles, the mora
torium on war debts called by
Presidcnt Hoover occurred before
the rise of the Nazi party to power
in Germany.
In concluding his discussion of the
Versailles Treaty, Dr. Knoles said
that "the Treaty of Versailles had
veiy little to do with the rise of
Hitler and his power."
"If the United States of America had joined the League of Nations and
had lived up to its obligations, Japan would never have succeeded in Man
churia," stated Dr. Tully C. Knoles, president of the College of the Pacific,
at the Palo Alto Forum on the San Francisco Conference Monday evening.
If we had done this, he added, the world would have been saved from the
present situation.
Dr. Knoles pointed out that the nine-power agreement in 1922 failed at

the time of the Manchuria invasion
because it did not guarantee, but !
merely respected, the integrity of
China. The fact that neither Russia j
nor the United States belonged to ;
he League and both wanted to in
crease their trade with Japan in 1931. J
made the League impotent to employ
economic sanctions against the ag
gressor Japan, said Dr. Knoles.
