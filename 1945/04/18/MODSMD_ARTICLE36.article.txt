# 1920-19459 'Labor Day' Con Home Tradition
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Mr. Roth was disturbed. It was
Sunday, the Sunday before the Stan
ford Convalescent Home was to open
its doors. The lawns were clipped,
the Stanford Home, main unit for
the convalescents, was freshly swept
and in good repair. But Mr. Roth,
comptroller, had discovered in the
basement of the Home a substantial
layer of trash, left by workmen who
had baen repairing the place.
Knowing he could get no workers
on Sunday, Mr. Roth rang doorbells
on the Row, collecting a handful of
volunteers as he went. Working to
gether, they cleared the basement
and removed the trash from the
Home property. This first "labor
day" in 1920 was followed a month
later by an all-University Labor Day
with founders Mr. and Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins as hosts. At the close of
an afternoon's invigorating work, the
students were treated to a barbecue
prepared by the children's old friend,
Sam Mac Donald.
Program Includes Band Music
From the first barbecue and im
promptu entertainment by a few
band members in 1920, the particu
lars of the day have been enlarged
to include a program of band music,
and entertainment previewing the
Spring Show. The day is brightened
by the establishment of numerous
concessions on the grounds.
In 1923, the Phi Delta Theta house
sponsored the first Masque Ball ben
efiting the drive. Election of a king
and queen was one of the main fea
tures of the ball, and in 1930 this was
converted into one of the best in
struments for money-making that
was featured in the drive. For a
penny, a student could vote for the
candidate of his choice, women for
queen, men for king. For a week,
the voting proceeded at polls spot
ting convenient corners of Quad, and
in the last few hours before the end
of the election swarms of students
| flung pennies at the officials in order

to cast a few extra votes for then
candidates. In 1936, the king-queer
election netted over $4,000. $2,000 of
which was taken during the last few
hours.
Held Strawberry Breakfast

time in May 1929 for 25 cents a plate
at the Y.W.C.A.'s Strawberry Break
fast. Changed to a "lunch," later y
brunch, this event is held in Unio.
Court, complete with hot coffee and
hotter music.
In 1933, drive chairmen initiated a
Bean Day, during which every liv
ing group on campus served a noon
meal of beans, brown bread, apple?
and milk. Bean growers of Kinu
City, at the instigation of the Cham
ber of Commerce, donated one-halt
ton of beans to the Drive. A similar
move in Watsonville netted enough
apples to serve every student on
campus. Dairymen in Palo Alto anJ
vicinity gave the necessary gallons
of milk. Each living group then
turned over to the drive chairmen
the money it would have spent for
the regular noon meal. This day has
been declared a war casualty.
The student-sponsored off-campus
drive consists of a canvassing o:
Palo Alto residential districts for
funds in the name of the Home.
Theater Donates Funds
In 1927, the Stanford Theater ot
Palo Alto donated the funds from
one showing to the drive. This year,
a colored motion picture of students
now attending Stanford working at
the Con Home will be shown at the
Sunday movie April 29.
The drive will open April 30, under
the direction of Joan McDonough,
Cardinals member.

In 1933, drive chairmen initiated a
Bean Day, during which every liv
ing group on campus served a noon
meal of beans, brown bread, apple?
and milk. Bean growers of Kinu
City, at the instigation of the Cham
ber of Commerce, donated one-halt
ton of beans to the Drive. A similar
move in Watsonville netted enough
apples to serve every student on
campus. Dairymen in Palo Alto anJ
vicinity gave the necessary gallons
of milk. Each living group then
turned over to the drive chairmen
the money it would have spent for
the regular noon meal. This day has
been declared a war casualty.
The student-sponsored off-campus
drive consists of a canvassing o:
Palo Alto residential districts for
funds in the name of the Home.
Theater Donates Funds
In 1927, the Stanford Theater ot
Palo Alto donated the funds from
one showing to the drive. This year,
a colored motion picture of students
now attending Stanford working at
the Con Home will be shown at the
Sunday movie April 29.
The drive will open April 30, under
the direction of Joan McDonough,
Cardinals member.
Mr. Roth was disturbed. It was
Sunday, the Sunday before the Stan
ford Convalescent Home was to open
its doors. The lawns were clipped,
the Stanford Home, main unit for
the convalescents, was freshly swept
and in good repair. But Mr. Roth,
comptroller, had discovered in the
basement of the Home a substantial
layer of trash, left by workmen who
had baen repairing the place.
Knowing he could get no workers
on Sunday, Mr. Roth rang doorbells
on the Row, collecting a handful of
volunteers as he went. Working to
gether, they cleared the basement
and removed the trash from the
Home property. This first "labor
day" in 1920 was followed a month
later by an all-University Labor Day
with founders Mr. and Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins as hosts. At the close of
an afternoon's invigorating work, the
students were treated to a barbecue
prepared by the children's old friend,
Sam Mac Donald.
Program Includes Band Music
From the first barbecue and im
promptu entertainment by a few
band members in 1920, the particu
lars of the day have been enlarged
to include a program of band music,
and entertainment previewing the
Spring Show. The day is brightened
by the establishment of numerous
concessions on the grounds.
In 1923, the Phi Delta Theta house
sponsored the first Masque Ball ben
efiting the drive. Election of a king
and queen was one of the main fea
tures of the ball, and in 1930 this was
converted into one of the best in
struments for money-making that
was featured in the drive. For a
penny, a student could vote for the
candidate of his choice, women for
queen, men for king. For a week,
the voting proceeded at polls spot
ting convenient corners of Quad, and
in the last few hours before the end
of the election swarms of students
