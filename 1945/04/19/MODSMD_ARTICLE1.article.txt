# Red Troops Encircle Berlin; Reported 14 Miles from Capitol
## Fortress of Forst Entered; Germans Report 30-Mile Advance to Spremberg 
### 
LONDON, Thursday, April 19 (UP). —The Red Army, forging a 50-
mile arc around Berlin, was reported within sight of the Reich capital and
14 miles froa its municipal boundary last night, while to the southeast
Soviet forces entered the fortress of Forst and advanced 13 miles westward
in a drive to outflank the devastated city.
A vaguely worded German broadcast reported a spectacular 30-mile

" advance to to Spremberg, southeast"
anchor of the Berlin line to Finster
walde.
Such an advance would outflank
Berlin, leave the enemy only two es
cape routes to the south, and put the
Russians within 47 miles of the U.S.
First Army at Wurzcn. Thus it could
be construed that the Russians had
reached Finsterwalde or the entire
plan of operation had been tempo
rarily stalled in the Spremberg area
which earlier German reports said
the Russians had reached.
All enemy commentators agreed
that the situation had grown critical
east of Berlin where Soviet tanks ]
were reported overrunning the Na- i
zis.
The American army, completing
a 205-mile drive across the waist of
Germany, smashed three miles into
Czechoslovakia while Allied armies
to the north battled along the Elbe
to meet the Russians.
General Patton's Third Army, now
GOO miles beyond the Normandy
beaches, where the Allies landed 318
days ago, entered Czechoslovakia at
several points near Asch, located in
one of the four parts of the country
won by Adolf Hitler under the Su
deten agreement drawn up at the
1938 Munich conference. The Eva
sion technically split Germany
proper, as the American First and
Ninth and the British Second armies
A were battling to cross the Elbe River
™ from the Hamburg area in the north
to Dessau to the south.
The First Army was driving to
ward Dresden and a junction with
the Red Army which would make
the bisecting of the Reich complete. I
The Ninth Army captured the Elbe
River fortress of Magdeburg after a
22-hour battle. They found all four j
Elbe River bridges destroyed in that !
city, G1 miles from Berlin, but seized I
71 million dollars in reichsmarks and
silver coin in the local branch of j
the Reichsbank.

Soviet forces entered the fortress of Forst and advanced 13 miles westward
in a drive to outflank the devastated city.
A vaguely worded German broadcast reported a spectacular 30-mile

" advance to to Spremberg, southeast"
anchor of the Berlin line to Finster
walde.
Such an advance would outflank
Berlin, leave the enemy only two es
cape routes to the south, and put the
Russians within 47 miles of the U.S.
First Army at Wurzcn. Thus it could
be construed that the Russians had
reached Finsterwalde or the entire
plan of operation had been tempo
rarily stalled in the Spremberg area
which earlier German reports said
the Russians had reached.
All enemy commentators agreed
that the situation had grown critical
east of Berlin where Soviet tanks ]
were reported overrunning the Na- i
zis.
The American army, completing
a 205-mile drive across the waist of
Germany, smashed three miles into
Czechoslovakia while Allied armies
to the north battled along the Elbe
to meet the Russians.
General Patton's Third Army, now
GOO miles beyond the Normandy
beaches, where the Allies landed 318
days ago, entered Czechoslovakia at
several points near Asch, located in
one of the four parts of the country
won by Adolf Hitler under the Su
deten agreement drawn up at the
1938 Munich conference. The Eva
sion technically split Germany
proper, as the American First and
Ninth and the British Second armies
A were battling to cross the Elbe River
™ from the Hamburg area in the north
to Dessau to the south.
The First Army was driving to
ward Dresden and a junction with
the Red Army which would make
the bisecting of the Reich complete. I
The Ninth Army captured the Elbe
River fortress of Magdeburg after a
22-hour battle. They found all four j
Elbe River bridges destroyed in that !
city, G1 miles from Berlin, but seized I
71 million dollars in reichsmarks and
silver coin in the local branch of j
the Reichsbank.
