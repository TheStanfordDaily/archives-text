Last 'Farm' Dance in 1941
The last "Back to the Farm" was
in the spring of 1941 as a climax to
the Con Home drive. During the day
students wore farmers' clothes or
old-fashioned costumes of 50 years
ago. Women wore old-fashioned
bathing suits with long black stock
ings, middies, and shirt waists, while
the Stanford roughs got dolled up in
peg-topped trousers, checkered jack
ets, spats, straw hats, with handle
bar mustaches and hair parted in the
middle.
Nothing but bikes, rigs, and horses
and buggies was allowed on cam
pusâ€”anything with a motor was ex
cluded on "Back to the Farm" day.
A Gay Nineties Dance was always
held in the evening.
