### 
"Plow high schools are likely to be
affected by Army teachings" is the
subject of a survey just completed
by Dr. Bayard Q. Morgan of the Ger
manic Languages department, for an
article in the California Journal of
American Secondary Education, of
which he is associate editor.
The Journal is addressed to high
school teachers of the state, and Dr.
Morgan has sent questionnaires to
them asking their opinions of this
question in relation to the teaching
of Germanic languages.
Dr. Morgan found that no public
high school in the state thinks it
feasible to introduce Army curricu
lum into classes, because they cannot
meet as often as Army classes do,
that is, ten times a week.
Many teachers believe there will
be increased emphasis on the oral
aspect of teaching foreign languages.
Gramaphones, records, film projec
tors, and similar equipment will be
used. Dr. Morgan expects these
methods to be extended to colleges
also.
