# Dumbarton Symposium Topic
## Thurman Will Speak On Plans 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
"Dumbarton Oaks Versus Our
Constitution" will be discussed by
Samuel David Thurman, Jr., asso
ciate professor of law, at the Ameri
can Studies Symposium this after
noon at 4:15 in the Women's Club
house.
Mr. Thurman, whose special field
is constitutional law, will defend the
position that there is no constitu
tional block to our full participation
in a world organization, even to
committing a certain number of
troops, because, under the Constitu
tion, troops can already be called
out by the President.
Progress at Other Conferences
Another point Mr. Thurman said
he may wish to bring out is that
many persons expect too perfect a
plan to come out of the world se
curity conference in San Francisco,
April 25, without considering the tre
mendous amount of progress that has
already been made at Dumbarton
Oaks, Bretton Woods, Teheran, Yal
ta, and Cairo and the even greater
results that may come from future
conferences. He compared the for
mation of a world organizational
scheme to the process of forming the
United States Constitution, saying
that it was not the result of a single
conference.
World Security and the Constitution
Mr. Thurman has been requested
to speak on the general topic of the
world security organization in rela
tion to the Constitution several times
before local groups and at the recent
alumni conference.
A graduate of the University of
Utah in 1935, Mr. Thurman received
the LL.B. degree from Stanford in
1939. He practiced law in Salt Lake
City with Irvine, Skeen and Thur
man from 1939 to 1942 and has been
at Stanford in the School of Law
since then.
