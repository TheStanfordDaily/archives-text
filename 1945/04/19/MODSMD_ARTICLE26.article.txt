### 
Tickets arc now on sale in Room 202, Memorial Hall, for "The Merry
Wives of Windsor," by Otto Nicolai, a comic opera which is based on the
Shakespeare comedy and will be performed at the Stanford Memorial Au
ditorium May 24, 25, and 26, at 8:15 p.m.
The production is being offered by the Stanford Players in co-opera-

tion with the Division of Music. An
orchestra of approximately fifty
players and a chorus of forty to
gether with the twelve soloists will
be under the musical direction of
Herbert Jan Popper of the Music
Department. The entire production
will be under the supervision of F.
Cowlcs Strickland of the Department
of Speech and Drama.
Popular Overture
"This gay and tuneful opera is best
known for its overture, which is a
perennial favorite with concert or
chestras arid most of the major sym
phony orchestras," Mr. Strickland
said. All of the melodies of the over
ture are taken from the opera itself.
"In spite of the charm and gaiety
of the entire opera, it is seldom
heard in this country," Mr. Strick
land said. "None of the major op
era companies keep it in their reper
tories and fco it is only heard in an
occasional performance." Two im
portant productions of recent years
were given in the Hollywood Bowl
and by the Juilliard School of Music
in New York.
Modern Design
Wendell Cole is providing bright
and colorful settings. The opera is
in three acts with nine scenes, but
Mr. Cole has designed a modern
setting which will facilitate the shift
ing of the scenes and permit the op
era to be played without waits be
tween the scenes.
Opera at Stanford is becoming a

regular feature of each spring .sea
son. Other operas which have been
produced in recent years under the
direction of Dr. Popper and Mr.
Strickland have been "The Bartered
Bride" by Smetana, "The Beggars'
Opera" by Gay, and "The Gondo
liers" by Gilbert and Sullivan.
