# THE 						USE OF MEM AUD
## BUTTON, BUTTON, WHERE IS THE SPRING SHOW? 
### 
Ja:;f when we were cured of that vicious
habit of escaping through fire exits with our
Cellar check unpaid, we are faced with the de
sire of starting another great crime wave in
violent protest over the way our Cellar money
js being poured into Mem Aud.
Weighing the luscious downward feel of a
clior: frost against the use of our favorite aud,
temptation creeps over us like a bitter pall.
It just about knocked us in the* creek to hear
that the students' best and hammiest spring
festivity, the annual Spring Show, was going
to be given in the Little Theater this year. Ram s
Hear, which wanted to present the proceeds of
the Show to the Con Home Drive, will struggle
along in the Little Theater where the chances
for profit are greatly diminished, instead of in
our own Mem Aud. As a clincher, this fact casts
a long, dark shadow: even with four perform
ances in the Little Theater, two-thirds of the
student body would be unable to see the Spring
Show.
Upon investigation we found that Ram's Head
had become all tied up on dates and the place
was booked solid with rehearsals, concerts, op
eras, penthouse performances, etc. The whole
thing has just enough simple reason to it, to
make us disbelieve the whole setup.
All we know is that this guarter students
have asked for the auditorium for two things:
an assembly and Spring Show. After great
travail we are getting it for an assembly.
Instead we are being offered an operetta
which, as far as we can ascertain, has two stu
dents only in the cast, with all others in the
chorus solely.
Also there is an Oscar Wilde production by
the Stanford Players which reguires the main
auditorium. The players seldom draw a third
of their audience from the student body.
The Concert Series and the Tuesday Series,
of course, have their regular days during the
quarter, and they can hardly be said to be
pointed for the student audience.
We are as proud of the appearance our Uni
versity makes before the public and local
community as anyone. But we've learned to
traditional student activities as a maker
of loyal Stanford people with responsible and
memorable college experiences.
If on the one hand our advertised entertain
ment obviously appeals more to the public, and
in major productions we are sacrificing student
participation to "quality" performances, then
on the other hand we should have especially
safeguarded the few cherished dates that the
students have for getting together in the Mem
Aud to root for olios and melodrama.
There is no finger pointing to be done about
this poor situation. It seems innumerable "coun
cils," committees, and groups are involved. But
the favorite accompaniment of such divided
responsibilities is irresponsibility. And we for
one protest this final straw.
There are various people connected in fairly
neutral positions who certainly can, and ought
to, go to bat over this injustice-in-the-name-of
inertia and the irrevocability of schedules. We
are at bat.
