The news of the death of the beloved G.I.
reporter, Ernie Pyle, comes to freshen thoughts
of the many correspondents who have fallen
in this war.
From the necessary communication between
those at war and those at peace that these men
have tried to aid, Ernie Pyle was able to create
the most real and satisfying message in this
war.
He has won renown throughout the world, as
his small frame and frail goodness followed
American boys through the bleakest moments
of their missions.
lie seems always to have conveyed a nation's
feeling about them; and he moved between the
battle front and the home as a symbol of the
b each he tried ever to heal.
rmie Pyle will live long in many memories
a the best expression of an anxious people's
devotion to their men at war.
