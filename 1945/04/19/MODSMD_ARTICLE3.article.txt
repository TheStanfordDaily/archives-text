# Spring Sing To Be June 1
## 
### 
A little "Shine On Harvest Moon,"
a touch of "Junior Birdmen," a
sprinkling of "Stardust," and what
have we got? The Spring Sing! Dat
ed for the evening of Friday. June
1, in the Frost Memorial Amphi
theater, the Sing will be held under
Cardinals sponsorship to determine
the best musical presentation by liv
ing groups or combination of living
groups.
Martha Austin, Cardinal member
in charge, announced that all song
entries should be registered at the
ASSU office before May 18â€”as soon
as possible before that date so that
selections may be adjusted in cases
of duplication. Entry fee is 50 cents.
Reviewing the outcome of last
year's Sing, Cardinals made the rul
ing that entries from women's living
groups have no less than 25 singers.
In this way, the number of selections
will be cut down and the quality of
the singing probably improved.
Trophies will be awarded to the
best women's, the best men's, and
the best graduate groups. Last
year's winners were Casa Granada
in Lagunita, the SAE's and the Med
School. Six faculty judges will award
points for such items as appearance
of group, type and arrangement of
selection, and tonal quality, and win
ners will be announced at the close
of i.he Sing.
