The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for
some time in silence; at last the Caterpillar took the
hookah out of his mouth.
"You're awfully tall," said the Caterpillar.
"No, I'm not!" said Alice vehemently, shocked at the
Caterpillar's bad manners in making such a personal
remark, "I'm just the right size for Alices to be."
The Caterpillar shrugged his shoulders. "Then," he
said, "Alices come in inconveniently large sizes,"
"And,"he added reflectively, "unnecessarily stupid
varieties."
"I'm not stupid at all," protested Alice. "I'm really
terribly interested in the Postwar World, and very often
when the Rector comes over to tea I have simply won
derful discussions on what to do with the Russians."
The Caterpillar stopped puffing on his hookah for a
few surprised moments and peered at Alice over the
top of his mushroom, until Alice fancied that he must
need bifocals.
"It's time that you should know,"the Caterpillar said
at last, "that girls may be creatures of beauty, but
they are not creations of intelligence."
"Nonsense!" cried Alice, and she stamped her feet; "if
I am pretty, it is mostly chance; I am quite as capable
of being intelligent as anyone else."
"1 never said that you weren't capable of being intel
ligent," replied the Caterpillar, "I merely mentioned the
fact that you aren't."
"But I want to be different," said Alice petulantly, "I
want to be both pretty and intelligent."
"But you won't be," said the Caterpillar bluntly, "in
telligent girls are not appreciated; you would rather
be appreciated than be intelligent; therefore you will
remain stupid."
"But why aren't intelligent girls appreciated?" asked
Alice in a puzzled voice.
Because," said the Caterpillar, burbling his hookah
between clauses, "when girls try to he intelligent, it's
because they're not pretty; but they always try too
hard, and make a nasty mess of things."
"But aren't there any girls at all who are naturally
intelligent?" asked Alice hopefully.
"Few," replied the Caterpillar, "if any. If they are at
all pretty they repress their intelligence, because it
offends most people. If they aren't pretty, they are
forced by the circumstances to use their intelligence
to see that appreciation is not especially important any
way?"
"Gracious!" said Alice, "and to think how danger
ously close I came to being intelligent through discuss
ing international politics with the Rector!"
"Oh. don't he afraid of knowing a little about such
matters," said the Caterpillar, "afetr all, that is much
closer akin to prejudice than it is to intelligence."
And he set to burbling on his hookah.
"But wouldn't more education be dangerous?" asked
Alice, "because I must go through all sorts of grades
yet."
"Pish-tush!" said the Caterpillar, in the midst of a
burble. "The educators are fully aware of your prob
lem, and have instituted special Schools of Education
to make sure that a regard for intelligence is kept
at a safe and sanitary minimum."
Alice was just about to reply, when there was a
terrible explosion and she found herself enveloped
in a huge cloud of smoke that smelled of Latakia and
burning rubber, with just a tinge of brimstone. When
at last the smoke had cleared away, the Caterpillar,
the hookah, and the mushroom (except for a few
small bits scattered here and there) had completely
disappeared.
"Goodness! ' exclaimed Alice to no one in particular,
"either that was an Act of God; or else there must have
been a kink in the hookoh hose."
And Alice was probably right. SAM ANDERSON.

And he set to burbling on his hookah.
"But wouldn't more education be dangerous?" asked
Alice, "because I must go through all sorts of grades
yet."
"Pish-tush!" said the Caterpillar, in the midst of a
burble. "The educators are fully aware of your prob
lem, and have instituted special Schools of Education
to make sure that a regard for intelligence is kept
at a safe and sanitary minimum."
Alice was just about to reply, when there was a
terrible explosion and she found herself enveloped
in a huge cloud of smoke that smelled of Latakia and
burning rubber, with just a tinge of brimstone. When
at last the smoke had cleared away, the Caterpillar,
the hookah, and the mushroom (except for a few
small bits scattered here and there) had completely
disappeared.
"Goodness! ' exclaimed Alice to no one in particular,
"either that was an Act of God; or else there must have
been a kink in the hookoh hose."
And Alice was probably right. SAM ANDERSON.
WOMEN AN!) INTELLIGENCE
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for
some time in silence; at last the Caterpillar took the
hookah out of his mouth.
"You're awfully tall," said the Caterpillar.
"No, I'm not!" said Alice vehemently, shocked at the
Caterpillar's bad manners in making such a personal
remark, "I'm just the right size for Alices to be."
The Caterpillar shrugged his shoulders. "Then," he
said, "Alices come in inconveniently large sizes,"
"And,"he added reflectively, "unnecessarily stupid
varieties."
"I'm not stupid at all," protested Alice. "I'm really
terribly interested in the Postwar World, and very often
when the Rector comes over to tea I have simply won
derful discussions on what to do with the Russians."
The Caterpillar stopped puffing on his hookah for a
few surprised moments and peered at Alice over the
top of his mushroom, until Alice fancied that he must
need bifocals.
"It's time that you should know,"the Caterpillar said
at last, "that girls may be creatures of beauty, but
they are not creations of intelligence."
"Nonsense!" cried Alice, and she stamped her feet; "if
I am pretty, it is mostly chance; I am quite as capable
of being intelligent as anyone else."
"1 never said that you weren't capable of being intel
ligent," replied the Caterpillar, "I merely mentioned the
fact that you aren't."
"But I want to be different," said Alice petulantly, "I
want to be both pretty and intelligent."
"But you won't be," said the Caterpillar bluntly, "in
telligent girls are not appreciated; you would rather
be appreciated than be intelligent; therefore you will
remain stupid."
"But why aren't intelligent girls appreciated?" asked
Alice in a puzzled voice.
Because," said the Caterpillar, burbling his hookah
between clauses, "when girls try to he intelligent, it's
because they're not pretty; but they always try too
hard, and make a nasty mess of things."
"But aren't there any girls at all who are naturally
intelligent?" asked Alice hopefully.
"Few," replied the Caterpillar, "if any. If they are at
all pretty they repress their intelligence, because it
offends most people. If they aren't pretty, they are
forced by the circumstances to use their intelligence
to see that appreciation is not especially important any
way?"
"Gracious!" said Alice, "and to think how danger
ously close I came to being intelligent through discuss
ing international politics with the Rector!"
"Oh. don't he afraid of knowing a little about such
matters," said the Caterpillar, "afetr all, that is much
closer akin to prejudice than it is to intelligence."
And he set to burbling on his hookah.
