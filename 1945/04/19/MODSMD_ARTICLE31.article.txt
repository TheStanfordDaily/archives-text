The battle in Germany is in its last stage. The rem
nants of two German armies, one on the Oder and the
other on the Elbe, seem to be the last organized ele
ments of the army. But there are other fragments
that might well have large resources cached for a last
ditch struggle, and which will have to be dealt with.
The main body, being squeezed together in central
Germany, is putting up a fierce battle so far. On the
western front, their southern wing has been pried loose
from Leipzig, but should retire through the highly de
fensive Bautzen area to the hills around Dresden and
Torgau, the strongest sector of the Elbe. In the center,
the American 9th Army has pushed two bridgeheads
across the river, one at Magdeburg and the other on the
direct line to Berlin. They were thrown out of the
latter, but hold the former.
The British are still moving in parallel columns across
the northern plains. They are approaching Hamburg,
where they should meet a stiff fight.
The Soviets are so far launching two drives. One
is in the center, towards Berlin, and is employing five
infantry divisions and one armored division at last re
ports. The Germans admit that this attack has broken
their lines, while Moscow is still laconic about all op
erations. The second drive is in the south, where Konev
seems to be trying to turn both ends of the Spree line
and to break through to the 3rd Army, advancing on
Dresden.
The whole German defense structure is rotten, how
ever. A vast amount of territory, which contains
many of the homes that the German soldiers were de
fending, has fallen. Any intelligent soldier must know
that the game is nearing its end, and nobody wants to
be shot in the last battle, if it has to be a lost. one.
What would be the use?
Secondly, it is decadent physically. The little materiel
left to the Wehrmacht was highly depleted by the dis
organized retreat across Germany. The war industry
necessary to refill the artillery parks and dumps, and
re-armor the panzers, is gone.
But the Germans are still organizing a scratch de
fense. They are basing it mostly on the great con
centrations of AA guns around Berlin, Dresden, and
Leipzig. These are being zeroed so as to produce verti
cal lanes of fire, useful more against tanks than in
counterbattery. However, once one big breach is made,
the whole structure should collapse. News is so sketchy
from the front that it might have been already.
POCKETS
The German army will soon fragmentize, because its
structure as a while will collapse, but the fanaticism
and brutality of the particles might cause us more
trouble. One of those particles is now making a stand
in Bavaria, and forcing General Patch, operating south
of the Main, to fight a hard battle for Nurenburg, but
this should only be held long enough for the main Ger
man body to establish a line along the Danube. The
Bavarian mountains might prove a difficult barrier, but
the Danube should not cause us much trouble, consid
ering our superiority of numbers. The mountains, how
ever, are incapable of supporting an army, so every
thing will depend on stores. We do not know how much
the Germans have.
Norway might also prove hard to take. The garrison
commander, however, might be inclined to surrender
for reasons of humanity, and again, any battle depends
on the amount of enemy stores.
Some German units nre holding out in the Harz
Mountains, but they might not last too long. The Ruhr
pocket has been virtually wiped out, and the German
resistance in Holland is lessening.
But the hardest part of the European war is certain
ly over.

The main body, being squeezed together in central
Germany, is putting up a fierce battle so far. On the
western front, their southern wing has been pried loose
from Leipzig, but should retire through the highly de
fensive Bautzen area to the hills around Dresden and
Torgau, the strongest sector of the Elbe. In the center,
the American 9th Army has pushed two bridgeheads
across the river, one at Magdeburg and the other on the
direct line to Berlin. They were thrown out of the
latter, but hold the former.
The British are still moving in parallel columns across
the northern plains. They are approaching Hamburg,
where they should meet a stiff fight.
The Soviets are so far launching two drives. One
is in the center, towards Berlin, and is employing five
infantry divisions and one armored division at last re
ports. The Germans admit that this attack has broken
their lines, while Moscow is still laconic about all op
erations. The second drive is in the south, where Konev
seems to be trying to turn both ends of the Spree line
and to break through to the 3rd Army, advancing on
Dresden.
The whole German defense structure is rotten, how
ever. A vast amount of territory, which contains
many of the homes that the German soldiers were de
fending, has fallen. Any intelligent soldier must know
that the game is nearing its end, and nobody wants to
be shot in the last battle, if it has to be a lost. one.
What would be the use?
Secondly, it is decadent physically. The little materiel
left to the Wehrmacht was highly depleted by the dis
organized retreat across Germany. The war industry
necessary to refill the artillery parks and dumps, and
re-armor the panzers, is gone.
But the Germans are still organizing a scratch de
fense. They are basing it mostly on the great con
centrations of AA guns around Berlin, Dresden, and
Leipzig. These are being zeroed so as to produce verti
cal lanes of fire, useful more against tanks than in
counterbattery. However, once one big breach is made,
the whole structure should collapse. News is so sketchy
from the front that it might have been already.
POCKETS
The German army will soon fragmentize, because its
structure as a while will collapse, but the fanaticism
and brutality of the particles might cause us more
trouble. One of those particles is now making a stand
in Bavaria, and forcing General Patch, operating south
of the Main, to fight a hard battle for Nurenburg, but
this should only be held long enough for the main Ger
man body to establish a line along the Danube. The
Bavarian mountains might prove a difficult barrier, but
the Danube should not cause us much trouble, consid
ering our superiority of numbers. The mountains, how
ever, are incapable of supporting an army, so every
thing will depend on stores. We do not know how much
the Germans have.
Norway might also prove hard to take. The garrison
commander, however, might be inclined to surrender
for reasons of humanity, and again, any battle depends
on the amount of enemy stores.
Some German units nre holding out in the Harz
Mountains, but they might not last too long. The Ruhr
pocket has been virtually wiped out, and the German
resistance in Holland is lessening.
But the hardest part of the European war is certain
ly over.
The battle in Germany is in its last stage. The rem
nants of two German armies, one on the Oder and the
other on the Elbe, seem to be the last organized ele
ments of the army. But there are other fragments
that might well have large resources cached for a last
ditch struggle, and which will have to be dealt with.
