## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
Both visitors and delegates to the Peace Conference in San Francisco
will be able to use the documentary exhibit on the League of Nations, the
Paris Peace Conference and other groups now on display at the Hoover
War Library, according to Miss Nina Almond, librarian.
The exhibit is in both the East and West Rooms, under the general

►heading of "Experiences in Inter
national Government and Interna
tional Co-operation since the Inter
national Peace Conference at The
Hague in 1899, with Emphasis on the
Period since IK 18."
I Story of ihe League
The exhibit in the West Room is
a documentary story of the establish
ment of the League of Nations, in
cluding pictures of the committee
who drafted it, minutes of the Min
ister of Foreign Auuirs, minutes of
the first meeting of the Council of
the League, and the acceptance of
the Covenant.
Another section of the exhibit
deals with activities of the League
with representative publications.
Some of the committees which have
reports in this section are Public
Health, Slavery, Communications,
j and Foreign Trade. One book in this
collection publishes all the treaties
made by these groups since 1920.
Revision of the Covenant of the
League, by means of constitutional
amendments, occupies another sec-
I tion.
Island Question
Documents dealing with German
colonies, or the mandatory system,
will probably figure in the second
conference, Miss Almond said. The
League gave all German possessions
in the Pacific north of the Equator
to Japan. Although Japan withdrew,
she kept all these possessions, in
cluding the Marianas, Carolines, and
Marshall Islands groups, with the
islands of Palau, Saipan, Yap. Tin
ian, and Truk.
There is a documentary exhibit of
the establishment of a Permanent
Court of Justice at The Hague and
revisions of the statute up to the
present time, as well as the publica
tions of the Internationa] Labor Of
fice and Labor Organization.
Broadcasting, art, and educational
methods are displayed as being part
of a movement to further the under
standing of mutual co-operation of
countries belonging to the League.
The Hague to UNRRA
The East Room, which includes
documents of international confer
ences and congresses, displayed in
chronological order, begins with The
Hague in 1899, a conference which
was not to settle a war, but was
merely to preserve the peace.
The Peace Conference of 1919, the
Rhineland High Commission, the At
lantic Charter, Dumbarton Oaks,
Bretton Woods—all are shown in of
ficial United States state documents,
with the exception of only a few,
Miss Almond said.
Arabian Propaganda
The collection of delegation propa
ganda at the Peace Conference of
1919 is unique in that no other li
brary has one like it, Miss Almond
said. In this display are examples of
the propaganda used by 53 delega
tions, including Arabia and Bul
garia.
Some wanted to become separate
countries, others wanted to be at
tached to larger ones. All came to
the Peace Conference with these
ideas.
The exlubit will be on display
throughout -vhe Conference.

national Government and Interna
tional Co-operation since the Inter
national Peace Conference at The
Hague in 1899, with Emphasis on the
Period since IK 18."
I Story of ihe League
The exhibit in the West Room is
a documentary story of the establish
ment of the League of Nations, in
cluding pictures of the committee
who drafted it, minutes of the Min
ister of Foreign Auuirs, minutes of
the first meeting of the Council of
the League, and the acceptance of
the Covenant.
Another section of the exhibit
deals with activities of the League
with representative publications.
Some of the committees which have
reports in this section are Public
Health, Slavery, Communications,
j and Foreign Trade. One book in this
collection publishes all the treaties
made by these groups since 1920.
Revision of the Covenant of the
League, by means of constitutional
amendments, occupies another sec-
I tion.
Island Question
Documents dealing with German
colonies, or the mandatory system,
will probably figure in the second
conference, Miss Almond said. The
League gave all German possessions
in the Pacific north of the Equator
to Japan. Although Japan withdrew,
she kept all these possessions, in
cluding the Marianas, Carolines, and
Marshall Islands groups, with the
islands of Palau, Saipan, Yap. Tin
ian, and Truk.
There is a documentary exhibit of
the establishment of a Permanent
Court of Justice at The Hague and
revisions of the statute up to the
present time, as well as the publica
tions of the Internationa] Labor Of
fice and Labor Organization.
Broadcasting, art, and educational
methods are displayed as being part
of a movement to further the under
standing of mutual co-operation of
countries belonging to the League.
The Hague to UNRRA
The East Room, which includes
documents of international confer
ences and congresses, displayed in
chronological order, begins with The
Hague in 1899, a conference which
was not to settle a war, but was
merely to preserve the peace.
The Peace Conference of 1919, the
Rhineland High Commission, the At
lantic Charter, Dumbarton Oaks,
Bretton Woods—all are shown in of
ficial United States state documents,
with the exception of only a few,
Miss Almond said.
Arabian Propaganda
The collection of delegation propa
ganda at the Peace Conference of
1919 is unique in that no other li
brary has one like it, Miss Almond
said. In this display are examples of
the propaganda used by 53 delega
tions, including Arabia and Bul
garia.
Some wanted to become separate
countries, others wanted to be at
tached to larger ones. All came to
the Peace Conference with these
ideas.
The exlubit will be on display
throughout -vhe Conference.
Both visitors and delegates to the Peace Conference in San Francisco
will be able to use the documentary exhibit on the League of Nations, the
Paris Peace Conference and other groups now on display at the Hoover
War Library, according to Miss Nina Almond, librarian.
The exhibit is in both the East and West Rooms, under the general

►heading of "Experiences in Inter
national Government and Interna
tional Co-operation since the Inter
national Peace Conference at The
Hague in 1899, with Emphasis on the
Period since IK 18."
