At last there is real understanding
between the United tSates and Rus
between the United Stales and Rus
sia is one of the leading nations of
the world and very likely her poli
cies will become part of the United
Nations.
We have more in common with
the Russians than we realize. Both
of us have large areas of land rich
in resources, large populations, vast
modern cities, aggressive intellectual
minorities and progressive govern
ments.
Radical Communism is dead,
while the economic system becomes
more nearly akin to Socialism each
year.
Those individuals who compare
Communism with Fascism simply
are misled. Russian Communism
has been, and is, the primitive
stage in the development of a
Russian economic democracy.
In the past twenty-eight years the
living conditions of the people have
improved remarkably, even though
inferior to American living stand
ards. The people in these recent
years have gained more to eat, a
more competent educational system,
and tolerable working conditions.
Recently the trend has been for
less rigid control over the people
so that in the strictest sense the po
litical system cannot be considered
totalitarian.
We too arc drifting more to
ward an economic.democracy. In
the next few decades we shall
become a more socialistic nation
with more government control of
production and employment, how
ever in a democratic fashion. The
trend during the last twelve years
has been toward economic de
mocracy, and this trend will in
evitably continue.
Throughout the world the tend
ency toward Socialism seems strik
ingly evident. In such a state Russia,
as an economic pioneer, would hold
along with, the United States the
leading position. Considering this,
the policies of late have been far
sighted. We understand Russia, for
we too are economic pioneers.
