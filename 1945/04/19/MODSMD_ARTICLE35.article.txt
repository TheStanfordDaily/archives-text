"Responsibility of Women in War
time" will be the subject of the ser
mon this Sunday at the Memorial
Church when the Y.W.C.A. will
sponsor the service, according to
Miss Pal Davidson, secretary of the
"Y."
The "Y" has planned the service
and has asked Dr. Elton Trueblood,
University chaplain, to preach on
this subject. Dean Mary Yost and
Marian Johnson, president, will read
the scriptures, and "Y" members will
usher.
It is hoped that these services will
become a yearly tradition, with a
special sermon to accent women's
activities, Miss Pat said.
