The California invitational track
and field meet Saturday will have a
"touch" of Star ford, judging from
some tentative Olympic Club entries.

"Dink Templeton, former Indian
mentor, will probably bring over a
twelve-man team although he is not
certain of all the entries yet."
So begins the latest communique
from the A.S.U.C. over Berkeley
way. It contains the typical Cal ap
proach. What they are trying to say,
but hate to admit, is that four Stan
ford students are competing in their
meet and that these four students,
with the rest of the Olympic Club
team - mates, possess an excellent
chance of taking the meet. Of
course, the Bears won't admit that;
so we'll give you the information
and let you decide for yourself.
The first name we come upon is
that of Ed Luce, high-jumper de
iuxe. Luce, without a doubt, is one
of the best high-jumpers in the na
tion. His best official mark this year
is G ft. 3 in., but he can do much
better with more competition. There
is probably not another man on the
coast to give him that competition,
so he will probably be content to
take a first and not get too over
worked.
Next, we find Emerson Hiler.
Hiler is a grad student in the Med
School in San Francisco and spends
most of his time studying. However,
he always seems to get in a little
practice i where he finds the time
nobody seems to know) and is still in
good shape. In this meet the odds
are that he will again beat Cal's
Roger Harding in the discus.
Talking about the discus, we come
to the name of Gordon "Klinger"
Dunn. A few years back, Dunn was
one of the best weight men at Stan
ford and he might give Hiler his
closest competition. Another ex-
Stanford star, Johnny Mottram, has
entered in the javelin.
There is also the possibility that
Gordon Levy, freshman class presi
dent and one of the outstanding high
school dash men of last year, will
enter. Levy has been getting back
into shape, but as yet has not been
able to enter any meets. Neverthe
less, he would stand a good chance
of winning both dashes. So far, the
coast has not come up with any Hal
Davises or Clyde Jeffries. In fact,
most of the times in the hundred
have been over 10 fiat. Levy ran the
hundred in 10 fiat in high school;
think what he can do now.
And poor Cal is resigned to its
fate. The '"touch" of Stanford might
very well prove to be the heaviest
hand that has hit Cal in the last
decade.

coast has not come up with any Hal
Davises or Clyde Jeffries. In fact,
most of the times in the hundred
have been over 10 fiat. Levy ran the
hundred in 10 fiat in high school;
think what he can do now.
And poor Cal is resigned to its
fate. The '"touch" of Stanford might
very well prove to be the heaviest
hand that has hit Cal in the last
decade.
The California invitational track
and field meet Saturday will have a
"touch" of Star ford, judging from
some tentative Olympic Club entries.

"Dink Templeton, former Indian
mentor, will probably bring over a
twelve-man team although he is not
certain of all the entries yet."
So begins the latest communique
from the A.S.U.C. over Berkeley
way. It contains the typical Cal ap
proach. What they are trying to say,
but hate to admit, is that four Stan
ford students are competing in their
meet and that these four students,
with the rest of the Olympic Club
team - mates, possess an excellent
chance of taking the meet. Of
course, the Bears won't admit that;
so we'll give you the information
and let you decide for yourself.
The first name we come upon is
that of Ed Luce, high-jumper de
iuxe. Luce, without a doubt, is one
of the best high-jumpers in the na
tion. His best official mark this year
is G ft. 3 in., but he can do much
better with more competition. There
is probably not another man on the
coast to give him that competition,
so he will probably be content to
take a first and not get too over
worked.
Next, we find Emerson Hiler.
Hiler is a grad student in the Med
School in San Francisco and spends
most of his time studying. However,
he always seems to get in a little
practice i where he finds the time
nobody seems to know) and is still in
good shape. In this meet the odds
are that he will again beat Cal's
Roger Harding in the discus.
Talking about the discus, we come
to the name of Gordon "Klinger"
Dunn. A few years back, Dunn was
one of the best weight men at Stan
ford and he might give Hiler his
closest competition. Another ex-
Stanford star, Johnny Mottram, has
entered in the javelin.
There is also the possibility that
Gordon Levy, freshman class presi
dent and one of the outstanding high
school dash men of last year, will
enter. Levy has been getting back
into shape, but as yet has not been
able to enter any meets. Neverthe
less, he would stand a good chance
of winning both dashes. So far, the
coast has not come up with any Hal
Davises or Clyde Jeffries. In fact,
most of the times in the hundred
have been over 10 fiat. Levy ran the
hundred in 10 fiat in high school;
think what he can do now.
