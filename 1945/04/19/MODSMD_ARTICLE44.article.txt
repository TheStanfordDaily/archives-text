# Monroe Faces Phi-Psi Today
## 
### 
The day of days has finally come.
Everybody has been waiting; no
one has been studying (the Boat
house has nothing to do with this,
contrary to the belief of most stu
dents). And how could they study,
anyway, knowing that f:ru>)' Phi
Psi and Monroe were going to have
it out in the fields of friendly strife.
No longer will the Cellar aggrega
tions forget politics and argue over
the merits or demerits of Luke Pitts
and Our Hasher Joe Sher, for today
a victor will be crownedâ€”a king will
either keep his title or lose it.
That is the way things stand. Both
Monroe and the Phi Psi teams are
as powerful and skillful as they
come. Both teams have excellent
material. Both teams are loaded
with sluggers. Both teams have out
standing pitchers.
Leading the Phi Psi's are pitcher
Luke Pitts and infielders Tom Ash
ley and Tom Hood. These three men
are natural athletes and have led
their team time and again to mag
nificent victories.
Opposing them will be the afore
mentioned Sher and first-sacker Ed
Luce. Both of these men have beer,
terrific in every encounter. The
game will be close all the way, and
the winner will probably continue
on the victory road.
In another one of the games
scheduled, Buchanan will meet Ty
ler. Tyler has already been set back
twice while Buchanan is still un
defeated, having upset the Legal
Eagles Tuesday in a spectacular
game. Shining for the Bearcats is
pitcher-slugger Frank Hoffman. He
is continuing his fine work, the work
that he started summer quarter, by
belting out hit after hit. Tyler, paced
by Bob Slobe and Joe Pickering,
still stands a good chance of dump
ing the Bearcats.
In the other games, Arguello meets
Flacks and U.S.A. faces the Lega!
Eagles.
