# Everett Dean Has Fine Record in Coaching

(This is tin' second in a series of
interviews with members of the
Stanford coaching staff).
Successful basketball teams seem
to be synonomous with Everett
Dean, Stanford's head basketball
coach. Considered as one of the top
basketball coaches in the nation,
Dean's record speaks for itsell.
He graduated from Indiana Uni
versity in 1921 where he played
three years of varsity basketball,
three years of varsity baseball,
and two seasons of football. In
1921 he was acclaimed as all-con
ference and All-American center
on the Indiana basketball squad.
Speed and height being his assets
he played second base on the In
diana nine and end on the football
team.

After graduating from Indiana, he
took a coaching position at Carleton
College in Minnesota where his bas
ketball quintets won 49 out of 52
games over a three-year period. He
then returned to his alma mater as
head basketball and baseball coach
where his basketball and baseball
teams had an average standing of
second place over a 14-year period.
His basketball teams also annexed
three Big Ten titles during this time.
He came to Stanford in 1938 and
set to work with what remained of
Hank Luisetti and Company. In
'40 the Indians copped the South
orn Division title, and the follow
ing season saw his squad take the
Southern Division championship,
the Pacific Coast Conference
crown, and finally whip Dartmouth
for the NCAA title.
One of the essentials in Dean's
system of training basketball teams
is good physical condition. Training
begins the fall before the regular
season and consists of circling the
track to build up wind and stamina,
and playing volleyball and Softball
so that the team members can learn
(o cooperate to get the teamwork
so necessary in basketball.
Dean's system is very elastic and
is changed to suit the material at
hand as well as the opposition's ma
terial. A fast break is a major fac
tor in the Indian defense, and Dean's
teams seem to use a man-to-man de
fense for the most part. However,
in the NCAA playoffs Dean had his
squad using a different defense each
night they played.
Many top basketball mentors
have received their training under

Dean. Osborne Cowles, Dartmouth
coach, came up against his former
coach when Dean's quintet defeat
ed him in '42. Fifteen of the top
basketball coaches in the state of
Indiana in 1942 received their
training under him. He has been
selected to teach a basketball class
for coaches at the University of
Utah from July 5 to 11. He is also
a member of the board of directors
of the National Association of Bas
ketball Coaches.
Another evidence of his successful
career is lifetime record of 321 wins
against 124 losses, a winning per
centage of .724.
