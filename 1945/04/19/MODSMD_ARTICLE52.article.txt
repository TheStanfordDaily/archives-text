# Hoover Writes Series on Dumbarton Oaks Plan
## 
### BOB PECK 
It was just 50 years ago this quar
ter that Herbert Clark Hoover was
graduated with the class of 1895 from
Stanford, the first class ever to com
plete four years' training in the new
University. Now working on cur
rent topics and peace problems,
Stanford's most beloved alumnus
has retired from the rigor of public
life and press conferences and is
quietly working on books and papers
such as his "Problems ' of Lasting
Peace," published in collaboration
with Hugh Gibson in 1942.
Connected with Mining
As an undergraduate at Stanford,
Mr. Hoover worked with the Ar
kansas and United States Geological
Surveys and in the mines of Califor
nia. After graduation he did work in
mining engineering in Africa, Eu
rope, Asia, Australia, and North
America until the outbreak of World
War I. After work with the Amer
ican Relief Administration during
the war, Mr. Hoover became Secre
tary of Commerce until 1928 when
he was elected President.
During his career Mr. Hoover has

kept in constant touch with his alma
mater. His acceptance speech of the
Republican nomination in 1928 was
made from the Stanford Stadium.
Election night, when it became ob
vious that the people of the United
States had chosen him to lead the
nation, Stanford students trekked up
to his hilltop house and serenaded
the happy Hoovers.

Pcace Proposals
Recently the North American
Newspaper Alliance requested Mr.
Hoover to write a series of articles
discussing the Dumbarton Oaks pro
posals and the coming San Francisco
Conference. From these articles we
quote briefly:
"The most fateful conference in
all American history is that which
meets at San Francisco to formu
late the proposals at Dumbarton
Oaks into a world charter of or
ganization for maintenance of
peace. During those fleeting mo
ments the future of mankind may
he molded for the next hundred
years. A third world war would
return the world to the barbarism
of the stone age. Those discover
ies of new methods of killing; this
shift from wars between men to
wars against women and children
and the gigantic destruction of
men's toil of centuries makes cer
tain the extinction of civilization.
"Ever thinking man and woman
prays for a successful issue of the
conference. The destruction of war
is now so terrible and the animosities
among nations have become so deep
that failure to assure a lasting peace
now means the end of all hopes for
humanity. America has fought this
war for the greatest purpose of all
time. That is to secure a lasting
peace.
