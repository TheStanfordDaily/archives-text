# Allen Tells History Of farm's Organ
## 
### GEORGANNE PARSONS 
During Dr. Warren D. Allen's 25 years at Stanford as University or
ganist, he has watched Stanford grow and also witnessed improvements in
what he terms ' one of the largest and most complex instruments from
the standpoint of mechanics on the campus," the organ placed by Mrs.
Leland Stanford in the Memorial Church.
In telling the engrossing history of the organ, Dr. Allen said that dur-

•"ing the earthquake it was unharmed
although the front wall of the church
fell into the Quad, and the dome
toppled. When the church was re
built, the organ was improved and
an echo organ was placed in the
front of the church.
Two at Once
Its 400 pipes are located behind
the painting in the galleries. Al
though this is a complete organ with
its own console, it can. be played
from one of the manuals on the
great organ in the choir loft, making
it possible for Dr. Allen to play two
organs at the same time.
After Dr. Allen's appointment as
organist, one manual was added to
the console to make the present four
and other additions were made to
practically double the volume. At
present there are from four to five
thousand pipes, the longest of which
is 32 feet and must be "mitred" to fit
into ihe church.
Increasing for Beauty
There are still a number of stops
which are to be added, but. Dr. Allen
hopes that these will be acquired in
the future. ''An organ is an instru
ment to which numerous additions
may be made, each one increasing its
range and beauty," he commented.
He emphasized the fact that the
organ belongs to the students, and
he urges them to suggest pieces that
the would like to have played at the
Thursday and Sunday recitals.
"These recitals are intended to give
the students an opportunity to get
away from the hurly-burly of school
life and spend a few minutes in the
quiet of the church listening to beau
tiful nusic," Dr. Allen stated. He
also invited any students who are
interested to come to the choir loft
during the recitals and watch him
play.
Great Things to Come
After the war he hopes that the
University will again present re
citals by great visiting organists.
Guest artists, including Marcel Du
pre, Joseph Bonnet, and Lynnwood
Farnam, have played at Stanford,
and Dr. Allen's hope is that the stu
dents will be able after the war to
hear some of the famous young or
ganists who are now in the armed
forces.
When asked about students' tastes
in organ music, Dr. Allen said that
the interests of music lovers show
remarkable changes. "When I first
came, people wanted to hear roman
tic love songs and arrangements of
piano pieces; now Bach and other
great masters seem to be the fa
vorites."
The adaptability of the organ to
emergency needs was illustrated last
Thursday, when a quick change of
program, in memoriam, was made
only an hour after the radio an
nounced the death of the President.
With little advance announcement,
crowds came on Friday noon and
Sunday morning to observe the day
by listening to music and participat
ing in worship.
Surprise for Hoover
Dr. Allen recalled another im
promptu occasion when the organ
and the choir were called upon. "At
the inauguration of President Hoo
ver in 1929, N.B.C. asked for a sur
prise program which we prepared
overnight. On this national hook
up we had the largest audience in
Stanford history. On another occa
sion, we broadcast portions of '"Judas
Maccabaeus" by Handel to the Uni
versity of Chile. After the war it is
hoped that this great organ may
be heard more often on the air."
Dr. Allen, who received his train
ing abroad in Paris and Berlin, was
recently invited back to the College
of the Pacific, where he was Dean
of the Conservatory of Music before
coming to Stanford, and was given an
honorary degree. While at Stanford
he has seen the music section grow
from one course (choir) to the pres
ent Division of Music in the School
of Humanities.

Dr. Allen recalled another im
promptu occasion when the organ
and the choir were called upon. "At
the inauguration of President Hoo
ver in 1929, N.B.C. asked for a sur
prise program which we prepared
overnight. On this national hook
up we had the largest audience in
Stanford history. On another occa
sion, we broadcast portions of '"Judas
Maccabaeus" by Handel to the Uni
versity of Chile. After the war it is
hoped that this great organ may
be heard more often on the air."
Dr. Allen, who received his train
ing abroad in Paris and Berlin, was
recently invited back to the College
of the Pacific, where he was Dean
of the Conservatory of Music before
coming to Stanford, and was given an
honorary degree. While at Stanford
he has seen the music section grow
from one course (choir) to the pres
ent Division of Music in the School
of Humanities.
During Dr. Warren D. Allen's 25 years at Stanford as University or
ganist, he has watched Stanford grow and also witnessed improvements in
what he terms ' one of the largest and most complex instruments from
the standpoint of mechanics on the campus," the organ placed by Mrs.
Leland Stanford in the Memorial Church.
In telling the engrossing history of the organ, Dr. Allen said that dur-

•"ing the earthquake it was unharmed
although the front wall of the church
fell into the Quad, and the dome
toppled. When the church was re
built, the organ was improved and
an echo organ was placed in the
front of the church.
Two at Once
Its 400 pipes are located behind
the painting in the galleries. Al
though this is a complete organ with
its own console, it can. be played
from one of the manuals on the
great organ in the choir loft, making
it possible for Dr. Allen to play two
organs at the same time.
After Dr. Allen's appointment as
organist, one manual was added to
the console to make the present four
and other additions were made to
practically double the volume. At
present there are from four to five
thousand pipes, the longest of which
is 32 feet and must be "mitred" to fit
into ihe church.
Increasing for Beauty
There are still a number of stops
which are to be added, but. Dr. Allen
hopes that these will be acquired in
the future. ''An organ is an instru
ment to which numerous additions
may be made, each one increasing its
range and beauty," he commented.
He emphasized the fact that the
organ belongs to the students, and
he urges them to suggest pieces that
the would like to have played at the
Thursday and Sunday recitals.
"These recitals are intended to give
the students an opportunity to get
away from the hurly-burly of school
life and spend a few minutes in the
quiet of the church listening to beau
tiful nusic," Dr. Allen stated. He
also invited any students who are
interested to come to the choir loft
during the recitals and watch him
play.
Great Things to Come
After the war he hopes that the
University will again present re
citals by great visiting organists.
Guest artists, including Marcel Du
pre, Joseph Bonnet, and Lynnwood
Farnam, have played at Stanford,
and Dr. Allen's hope is that the stu
dents will be able after the war to
hear some of the famous young or
ganists who are now in the armed
forces.
When asked about students' tastes
in organ music, Dr. Allen said that
the interests of music lovers show
remarkable changes. "When I first
came, people wanted to hear roman
tic love songs and arrangements of
piano pieces; now Bach and other
great masters seem to be the fa
vorites."
The adaptability of the organ to
emergency needs was illustrated last
Thursday, when a quick change of
program, in memoriam, was made
only an hour after the radio an
nounced the death of the President.
With little advance announcement,
crowds came on Friday noon and
Sunday morning to observe the day
by listening to music and participat
ing in worship.
