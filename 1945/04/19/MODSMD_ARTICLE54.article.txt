# Go-By Given To Features At Stanford
## 
### 
"Hangover Square," which the ads
teasingly dubbed "where no woman
is safe," and "Experiment Perilous"
opened at the Stanford yesterday in
an aura of psychopathies and insan
ity.
"Experiment Perilous," slightly the
better of the two efforts, unfortu
nately is not able to grasp the in
tensity of feeling that R-K-O and
Director Jacques Tourneur obviously
strove for. The body of the picture
never lives up to the promise shown

by the first few
scenes in which
George Brent, as
a doctor of the
gaslight era, first
stumbles across
the mystery sur
rounding Paul
Lukas and wife
He d y Lamarr.
Near the middle
of the picture the
plot follows that

of the earlier and much better "Gas
light" with Lukas attempting to
drive Hedy insane and only failing
when . . . (but that would be de
stroying what's left of the plot).
The other psychopathic picture on
the double bill is the late Laird Cre
gar's last movie, "Hangover Square."
In an eflort to cash in on an earlier
Twentieth Century Fox success,
"The Lodger," Fox has again used
George Sanders and Cregar but re
placed Merle Oberon with the best
vixen player seen in a long time,
Linda Darnell. Unfortunately the
picture rarely achieves the horror
that "The Lodger" did.
Only in two scenes, the Fawkes'
Day bonfire, in which Cregar cre
mates the body of Linda Darnell,
and the climactic scene, in which he
sets fire to a concert hall, does the
picture utilize the possibilities of the
plot. Cregar is excellent as a com
poser who loses himself in moods of
horror, and Linda Darnell very ca
pably plays the part of a modern fe
male counterpart to lago.
George Sanders, who proved in
"The Moon and Sixpence" that he is
a great actor, is unable to salvage
anything out of his stereotyped role
as a Scotland Yard doctor.â€”Peck
