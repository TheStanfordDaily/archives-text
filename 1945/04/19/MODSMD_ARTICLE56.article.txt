# Frank Walker Praises Student Independence; Likes Farm Life
## Many Buildings Need Repair; Hopes For Better Union, Housing Expressed

(Editorial note: This is the fifth in our series of articles on Stan
ford's present and postwar outlook.
What is best at Stanford?" we asked. "Student independence," answered
Frank F. Walker, financial vice-president and one-time Stanford student.
"Here at Stanford the students learn to handle independence before they
are pushed into the world."
Our honor code, student government, and outside actviities tend to put

the students on their own. They as
sume responsibility gradually and
learn to think for themselves while
still in school. By the time they
graduate they are ready and able to
take care of themselves.
Professor-Student Friendship
Mr. Walker also likes the large ra
tio of faculty to students and the
Farm's friendly community life. He
believes that a professor can teach
more English to 25 students in a

small classroom than he could to 500
in a big impersonal lecture hall. And
very few large universities give their
student body such opportunity to
know their professors outside of
class.
When asked what he liked least
about Stanford, Mr. Walker men
tioned the need for repair in many
of the buildings. Most of the work
will have to wait until the war is
over, but a planning commission is
already studying our needs. Some
day, for instance, they intend to put
efficient lighting in all classrooms.
New Union
Mr. Walker has many hopes for
our future. First we must have a
new Union where we can have good
campus dances. It will have more
recreational facilities and will be
large enough to take care of an ex
panding student body. It should also
have room for parents and returning
graduates who want to stay over
night on campus.
We need an adequate Faculty
Clubhouse, new physics and Law
School buildings, and a new basket
ball pavilion.
More Houses
Most of all, we need more living
accommodations, especially for en
tering men and graduate students.
Freshman men must have more
modern quarters, and graduates need
more chance to get together. The
graduates come from other schools
all over America, and the present
system throws them into widely sep
arated houses where they cannot be
come acquainted.
Mr. Walker has three definite pre
dictions for the future. First, the
eminence of our faculty will continue
and increase. Second, Stanford will
become even more popular as a lead
ing school for young men and wom
en. Third, we will have more and
more money for scholarships and
similar needs as more people ap
preciate our role in civilizing the
West.

tioned the need for repair in many
of the buildings. Most of the work
will have to wait until the war is
over, but a planning commission is
already studying our needs. Some
day, for instance, they intend to put
efficient lighting in all classrooms.
New Union
Mr. Walker has many hopes for
our future. First we must have a
new Union where we can have good
campus dances. It will have more
recreational facilities and will be
large enough to take care of an ex
panding student body. It should also
have room for parents and returning
graduates who want to stay over
night on campus.
We need an adequate Faculty
Clubhouse, new physics and Law
School buildings, and a new basket
ball pavilion.
More Houses
Most of all, we need more living
accommodations, especially for en
tering men and graduate students.
Freshman men must have more
modern quarters, and graduates need
more chance to get together. The
graduates come from other schools
all over America, and the present
system throws them into widely sep
arated houses where they cannot be
come acquainted.
Mr. Walker has three definite pre
dictions for the future. First, the
eminence of our faculty will continue
and increase. Second, Stanford will
become even more popular as a lead
ing school for young men and wom
en. Third, we will have more and
more money for scholarships and
similar needs as more people ap
preciate our role in civilizing the
West.

(Editorial note: This is the fifth in our series of articles on Stan
ford's present and postwar outlook.
What is best at Stanford?" we asked. "Student independence," answered
Frank F. Walker, financial vice-president and one-time Stanford student.
"Here at Stanford the students learn to handle independence before they
are pushed into the world."
Our honor code, student government, and outside actviities tend to put

the students on their own. They as
sume responsibility gradually and
learn to think for themselves while
still in school. By the time they
graduate they are ready and able to
take care of themselves.
Professor-Student Friendship
Mr. Walker also likes the large ra
tio of faculty to students and the
Farm's friendly community life. He
believes that a professor can teach
more English to 25 students in a

small classroom than he could to 500
in a big impersonal lecture hall. And
very few large universities give their
student body such opportunity to
know their professors outside of
class.
When asked what he liked least
about Stanford, Mr. Walker men
tioned the need for repair in many
of the buildings. Most of the work
will have to wait until the war is
over, but a planning commission is
already studying our needs. Some
