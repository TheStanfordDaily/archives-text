### 
Wallace Stegner, author of "The
Big Rock Candy Mountain" and
other novels, will join the Stanford
faculty this fall in the Humanities
department.
In the May issue of Look maga
zine there is an article on prejudices
in America by Mr. Stegner. To do
Look's survey on prejudices, Steg
ner spent a year in travel and re
search. The editors compiled the
result in the book "One Nation," to
be published this fall. The article
in Look called "Prejudice: Our Post
war Battle" is based on this book.
This pictorial article will be found
on pages 47-51 in the current maga
zine.
While in college, Stegner turned to
magazine writing, and won a Brown,
Little novelette award for his "Re
membering Laughter." His work
earned "one of the most important
novelists in America" praise from
Sinclair Lewis.
Stegner's article in Look is "a vivid
warning of the consequences of ra
cial and religious intolerance." It
deals with the hate propaganda and
prejudices of the American public.
