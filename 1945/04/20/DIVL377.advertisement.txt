CLASS OF 1850
) '
Fads and fancies in college costumes are by
no means modern phenomena. Here is a
gay undergraduate of the Class of 1850.
Observe his flowing collar and tie, his super
expanse of Panama brim, and his studied jfSk
air of nonchalance. Jf«j J:
This was in ISSO, when America was 112
basking in peace. The Golden West was
opening up, and Express Service was keep- VjjC
ing pace. Today, there are few fads and fan- Jj\j
cies on the college campus. They have given m ' / '-m
place to the uniformity and efficiencies of F ,W / II
war time. Thousands of students are con- J // y /
centrated on the needs of the nation in arms. / J \j 112
Railway Express is devoting its nation- Ny L 112
wide services, both rail and air, primarily 112" 1 / <?A
to speeding war materiel. To help all con- I J 1
cerned, you can do three simple things with If \
your 1945 home packages and baggage: // 112 JZ \k- .-
Pack securely — address clearly and ade- J,>', \
quarely —avoid abbreviating state names.
