# New Amendment Needed-Thurman
## 
### 
The constitutional rule that any
treaty entered into by the United
States must be ratified by two-thirds
of the Senate may cripplc our effec
tive participation in a world security
organization, Samuel David Thur
man, associate professor of law, said
yesterday at the American tSudics
Symposium.
Mr. Thurman proposed two solu
tions to the problem. We may use
executive agreements in preference
to "treaties," which has been done
many times in our history but in
volves some circumvention of the
Constitution. Or we may take the
alternative, highly recommended by
Mr. Thurman, of adding a twenty
second amendment giving Congress
the power to ratify treaties by a ma
jority vote of both houses.
Failure of Isolationism
Mr. Thurman said that, for 50 years
isolationism on the part of both the
people and Congress, through the
two-thirds rule, has kept the United
States from world co-operation. He
echoed the feeling of many Ameri
cans that "the necessity for preven
tion of* a third experiment with the
i engines of destruction" was mani-
I fest and that since isolationism has
| failed to preserve the peace, "why
i not try something else?"
In answer to another problem —

the constitutionality of the U.S. com
mitting troops to maintain peace by
force — Mr. Thurman replied that
there is no objection to the use of
troops as a police force. "War is one
thing, maintaining peace another,"
and the United States has used
troops 74 times outside of the United
States without a declaration of war.
i Danger of-Over Optimism
Drawing a parallel between the
formulation of the United States
Constitution and the world plan be
ing formed now, Mr. Thurman re
iterated the belief that we must not
expect perfection from the result of
a single conference, even such an
important one as that at San Fran
cisco April 25. We have the alter
natives of disagreement and failure
or compromise and eventual success.
The outline of the "United Na
tions" is clear to us now from what
is generally known about the Dum
barton Oaks plans, he said. He
pointed out that of the separate
groups—general assembly, security
council, secretariat, court, and eco
nomic and social council—the last
has an extremely important function,
for it will be its purpose to prevent
the seeds of war from even being
sown.
In the Stanford School of Law
since 1942, Mr. Thurman's special
field is constitutional law.
