nine campus living units will enter
tain freshmen Sunday from 2 to 5
p.m., giving new and old women
more opportunity to become indi
vidually acquainted and enabling
freshmen to decide where they could
live most happily next year.
Freshmen have signed for the
houses they wish to visit and for
convenience both living units and
guests have been divided into three
groups.
Freshman croup one consists of
Roble center, B wing, and Ventura;
group two, Roble A and C wings;
group three, Branner.
House groups arc:
One — Hawthorne, Madrono, Juni

three —Story, Redwoods, Oaks.
House group one will entertain
freshman group one from 2 to 3;
group two from 3 to 4; and group
three from 4 to 5 p.m.
House group two will entertain
freshman group two from 2 to 3;
group three from 3 to 4; group one
from 4 to 5 p.m.
House group three will entertain
freshman group three from 2 to 3;
group one from 3 to 4; group two
from 4 to 5 p.m.
Transfers and other new students
not living in freshman halls may
visit the houses at any time.
The social program planners have
asked that freshmen try to stay
within their groups and visit the
houses at designated hours if pos
sible.
Members of the Housing Commit

tee urged that all new women take
this opportunity to meet upperclass
women. Success of the social pro
gram, it is felt, is a primary factor
affecting the success of the commit
tee's entire housing plan.
