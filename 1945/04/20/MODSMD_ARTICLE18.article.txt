# Orchesis in Concert This Evening at 8:15
## 
### 
At 8:13 tonight the Stanford chap
ter of Orchesis will present its an
nual spring concert in the Memorial
Auditorium. The dances are all
composed, costumed, and performed
by Orchesis members who have been
working on the concert since last
fall.
The first part of the program will
consist of a group of classical forms
—Prelude, Nouturne, Chorale, Ave
Maria, a miniature ballet by Ibert,
a Scherzo and a Rhapsody.
The second part will be based on
folk styles, and will be presented as
a "Western Ballet."
The main idea for the Western
Ballet was developed by Mrs. Jac
queline Ogg, head of the Stanford
Orchesis chapter. She also choreo
graphed two sections of it, the "Ro
deo" and"From A-courtin' Too
Slow." The "Reel," also part of the
Western Ballet, was choreographed
by Janice Shaughnessy and Olgadale
Phillips.
This will be contrasted by a tra
ditional ballad, "Coopers and Wives,"
and a berceuse, "Broken Lullaby."
Though essentially modern, these
two pieces, with choreography by
Ellen Davis and Nancy Hand, will

express a mood more serious than
the cowboy love story of the Western
Ballet.
Choreographers for the other
numbers include Virginia DeLong,
Catherine Jones, Alice Webb, Nita
Bomberger and Betty Jane Voss.
The underlying theme of the pro
gram is a study of forms in music.
