No Evening Clothes
For the destitute peoples of Eu
rope, many of whom have died from
exposure and lack of adequate cloth
ing, it is necessary to contribute good
substantial clothing, useful to the
people who are to receive it. This
means that evening dresses and tux
edos, high-heeled shoes, and those
without either toes or heels cannot
be used. Articles which are needed
arc: infants' garments; men's and
boys' garments, including overcoats,
suits, coats, shirts, work clothes,
sweaters, underwear, and pajamas;
women's and girls' garments, over
coats, skirts, sweaters, dresses, un
derwear, and nightwear; caps and
knitted hcadwear (this does not in
clude wotnens' hats and men's dress
hats).
In addition (lie UNCC has put in
a call for bedding, including blan
kets, afghans, sheets, pillowcases,
for shoes, and for any usable rem
nants and piece goods a yard or
more in length.
