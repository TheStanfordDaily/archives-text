# Dr. Tresidder Congratulates Students' Housing Committee
## 
### 
Acceptancc by the Board of
Trustees of the plan for future hous
ing of Stanford women recom
mended by Housing Committee last
quarter was announced yesterday by
President Donald B. Tresidder.

Dr. Tresidder expressed his thanks
to the committee for their work and
indicated his gratification over the
results achieved. He called it "a dif
ficult job well done."
The plan was recommended to Dr.
Tresidder and Dean Mary Yost last
month after weeks of debate on
the problem of converting former so
rority houses to University units and
housing the unusually large fresh
man class; maintaining, meanwhile,
group congeniality without resorting
to a rushing system.
Main points of the accepted plan
include:
1. Agreement to have the same lot
system of room choosing for all
women's residences.
2. Consideration of casas in La
gunita as small, separate units, along
units.
3. Maintenance of the co-opera
tive living system in former sorority
houses, and independence of house
policy.
4. Recommendation that the Uni
versity work toward putting kitch
ens and co-operative living systems
into small Union units as soon as
practical and possible, if it is de
sired by women in the units.
5. Recommendation that house
bills be uniform in all women's resi
dences.
6. Establishment of an all-campus
social program to acquaint freshman
women with types of living units and
their members, and recommendation
that an educational pi'ogram be set
up outlining the duties, functions,
advantages, and disadvantages in all
types of living groups.
Recognizing that there will be dif
ficulties and a need for unified wom
en's action, Housing Committee rec
ommended that a permanent com
mittee be set up to co-ordinate the
social policy and generally judge the
success of the plan as it is worked
out. In such a committee the exist
ing dormitory system may be im
proved through the common ex
change of ideas.
Last quarter's Housing Committee
is expected to carry out the present
program. Former chairman Sally
Breuner has been graduated; a new
chairman will probably be desig
nated.
Committee members include:
Phyllis Sutherland, Joan Bailey,
Guyla Runyan, Jo Glasson, Nancy
Banning, Nada Skidmore, Marie
Wagner, B. J. Rucker, Margaret Hus
ton, Helen Jones, Merlon Albrecht,
Nancy Tilden, Pamela Strathairn, B.
J. Miller, Dorothy Taggart, Luana
Forkner, Marylou McClure, and
Beverley Leggett.
