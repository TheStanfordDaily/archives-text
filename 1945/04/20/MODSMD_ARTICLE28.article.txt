# WOMEN'S HOUSING
## A 						PLAN AND ITS FUTURE 
### 
The news that the Board of Trustees has ac
cepted the Housing Committee's plan is the
first real encouragement that the Committee
has had in working out the best possibilities
for a very difficult situation.
The committee was organized last quarter.
It was chosen with particular care to be repre
sentative and fair. We believe that the quality
of the work and the spirit in which it was pur
sued give evidence of this. All meetings were
open and well attended.
Several plans were introduced, of radically
different natures. The final one introduced by
Fran Jennings drew up clearly the inch-by
inch conclusions of the committee as a whole.
The plan has already been sufficiently en
dorsed by the Daily, Conference, and the cam
pus as a whole, so that the first part of the social
program has been set up and began last week
end and continues this week-end.
The plan is based on the essential contention
that among Stanford women there need be no
greater criteria for selection of one's fellow
residents than their own willingness to assume
the responsibilities of making the living unit
function.
After the tremendous effort of getting all sides
to agree on the plan, the program just begun
seems, as yet, not to be radical. And it is true;
it will not change the face of the campus over
night.
But strongly connected with the plan is the
p.doption of a quite new attitude by some of us.
Nobody can make this plan successful or even
adequate for Stanford women. They must make
it successful for themselves by showing their
willingness, and their ability to think along the
lines that are going to be best and necessary
for the future.
We hope that the hostesses throughout this
social program will remember that their visitors
value congenial living atmospheres as much
as they do themselves. And we hope their
visitors will remember that they are visiting
other people's homes where they can "draw,"
but ought to prefer to "gain" their place in the
group.
The Board of Trustees has shown its willing
ness to allow us to settle this matter as we want.
Many more of us are going to have to want to,
if we are to keep that responsibility.
