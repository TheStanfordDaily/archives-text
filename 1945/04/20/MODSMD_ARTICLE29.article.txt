# FRAUDULENT RIGHTEOUSNESS
## 
### 
One of the most difficult instincts which man
has not been able to eradicate from his thinking
even though it has caused him centuries of un
happiness, is his sense of being "right" because
he has the last word.
Tantamount is the irrevocable desire to try
to convince the guy who lost, that he is bad
because he was mistaken.
The simple theory of it usually receives pen
;;ive shakings of the head. Yet, when multiplied
to international size, ifs, ands, and buts, creep
in that change the whole complexion of the
question.
For a long time we have heard that "might
does nor make right" and we would teach the
world so. Curiously enough it requires might
to do so. But Americans place their might upon
the reasons that "only the free can be strong."
To prove the theory's excellence, we are win
ning a war. One of the noblest things about our
nation and its allies, is the unquenchable de
termination which has overcome the initial ad
vantages enjoyed by our enemies everywhere.
Since the first light of victory, however, there
i:; evident a certain growing tendency to be de

ceived about the planes, tanks, and guns which
have won this war, and call them "the power
of right."
In the beginning we knew our greater pro
duction schedules would make our victory, and
it is dangerous now to minimize that fact.
One of the signs of the danger is the way we,
Americans, prate about punishment, and pay
ment for the damage that war has done, by
those who have lost.
This awful sense of "righteousness" because
we are victorious seems to be slowly seeping
through the nation. Being mere mortals, surely
we enjoy its abiding feeling. Being sickened
of war, and death that everywhere can be laid
at the door of men's stupidities, short sighted
ness, and folly, we hope the people of the na
tion, in the determination of our future peace,
will deal in the broadest possible terms to bring
a sound chance for peace, and necessary econ
omic prosperity, to all peoples of the world, win
or lose.
We hope the punishment of war criminals
will be done strictly for recognized criminal of
fenses, and with as much just dispatch as pos
sible. If punishment turns into a celebration of
victory, surely Europe will hate us, and any
plans that come from us, for generations.
So with reparations, if we allow the debt of
invaders to be so high that they cannot get their
own economy on a stable basis, then we can
never ask them to listen to our reasoning for
peace, over a conference table.
Not only are these things evident, but now
we are moving toward reckless actions. Our
task requires the utmost farsightedness and jus
tice, the only spoils awaiting victors this time
if they must demand spoils, are hard decades
of misunderstanding, world-wide poverty, and
war.
