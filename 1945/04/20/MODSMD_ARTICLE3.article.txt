# 'Farm' Con Home Dance Tomorrow
## 
### 
"Back to the Farm" will be the
theme of the dance sponsored by
Women's Conference tomorrow night
in the Pavilion from 8 to 11:45. All
proceeds will go to the Con Home.
During intermission time, the Jun
ior Water Carnival group will give a
skit. Nancy Greenbaum will sing and
accompany herself in a "little farm
girl gag" and the Chalet quartet will
sing. Cardinals and Chappies will
present run on and run off skits.
The idea for the dance was derived
from the old "Back to the Farm"
days, the last of which was held in
1941 as a climax to Con Home Week.
Students tomorrow night, like those
of 1941, will wear jeans and cotton
dresses, all kinds of old clothes suit
able for a farm, or the type of clothes
their grandparents used to wearâ€”
old-fashioned bathing suits with long
black stockings, middies, shirt waists,
or for the men, peg-topped trousers,
checkered jackets, spats, straw hats,
handle-bar mustaches, and hair
parted in the middle.
Tickets for the dance will be sold
at the door for $1 per couple includ
ing tax. Cokes will be sold at the
dance, proceeds going to the Con
Home.
Charmian Kolar has announced
that patrons and patronesses will be
Dr. and Mrs. Max Savclle, Dr. and
Mrs. Richard A. Ogg Jr., and Dr. and
Mrs. Carl Brand.
Dance music will come from rec
ords of the number-one bands.
