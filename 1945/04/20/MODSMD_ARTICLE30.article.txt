### PEGGY FITTS 
There's a good show going on tonight in
Mem. Aud., not the least of its attractions being
that it's free for nothing and worth more than
that. Orchesis (pronounced Awk' -i-sis), the lo
cal Hot Licks and High Kicks Society for Double-
Jointed Coeds, is at it again, muscling into the
entertainment department (division of hard
breathing) with their yearly assortment of reel
ing, writhing, and fainting in coils.
I don't know how these kids do it. (Hemo-
Vita-Serts?) Commencing with a basic equip
ment that's far from unusual, working with lim
ited time (ridiculous, these 24-hour days!),
crowded schedules, hardwood floors, and hu
man ligaments, they never fail to come up with
one of the best show-times of the year from any
angle you care to mention. (Out of that orches
tra pit, bud!)
A program like this is a shot in the arm for
all those people (see them over there-) who
think dancing without men is no fun to do and
even less to watch. It's more fun than a ride to
Paly, with one of those calory-ridden ham
burgers at the end of it; more fun than a bad
movie (any movie without Van Johnson); more
fun than a-settin' and a-puffin' and a-kickin' the
same old shins under the bridge table of an
April PM. (Bridge on a table! Imagine!)
It's more fun because those people on the
stage are girls (even as you and I) out of your
class-rooms, your dining-halls, and the next
door convertible at the Drive-In. You've seen
them around, and maybe you've wondered how
come they've been getting smaller and smaller
the last few weeks (hello, down there!), but un
til you've seen them in the lights-camera-action
setting, doing the thing they're really good at
and looking as smooth as a little girl's curls,
you'll never know they had it in them.
