Secretary of State Stettinius has received a note from
Russia on reorganization of the Polish government and
will discuss the mutter with Soviet Foreign Commissar
Molotov when he arrives in Washington. W. Averill
Harriman, Sir Archibald Kerr and Molotov, who con
stitute the commission appointed at the Yalta Confer
ence to aid Poland in drawing up a government of na
tional unity, are scheduled to confer wilh Stettinius
and President Truman.
All indications arc that (he United Nations will
agree upon Ihe vital Polish within (he next few
days and most probably the Russian sponsored re
gime will remain substantially in power. The Polish
people, anyway, are more sympathetic toward (he
Russian sponsored regime, which is composed
chiefly of Polish resistance group leaders who seem
more truly representative of their people than (he
London Regime has ever been and is.
Poland, as well as the other countries of Eastern
Europe in conformance with the wishes of the people
are being firmly secured in the sphere of Russian poli
tics, and this all Slavic people desire. These countries,
impoverished by war, have few industries to rebuild
their economy and are ravished by famine and disease.
Russia, unlike the other great powers, is willing to do
much for them; hence ihey turn to her for aid, as they
know that she has the material wealth and the factories
most essential to large-scale economic reconstruction.
Politically, Russia will restore order in these coun
tries which have never known any real political order
and order may give the citizens the beneficial domin
ance that Russia may demand of them to keep the
peace in future years. She will begin to unify Europe.
Fascism its venture failed to unify Europe because
it appealed only to man's worst instincts, using brute
force and terror to bring the nations into line. The
Russian government has been far wiser in her politics,
using reason and persuasion rather than force to bring
nations into her sphere of influence.
For these reasons, therefore, most nations of Europe
are not. adverse to accepting Russian guidance in their
economic and political affairs.
