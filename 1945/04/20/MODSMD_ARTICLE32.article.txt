# Women's Housing Committee Plan
## 
### 
A. WOMEN'S HOUSING, IN
GENERAL
1. Agreed to maintain freshman
dormitory system as it is now.
2. Agreed to have the same sys
tem of room choosing for all wom
en's residences.
3. Agreed to consider casas in
Lagunita as small, separate units,
along with small Union units and
Row units.
4. Recommended, if it is de
sired by women in small Union
units, that the University work
toward putting kitchens and co
operative living into small Union
units as soon as practical and pos
sible, using the co-operative ex
sorority houses as a nucleus or
basis.
5. For the present, house regu
lations he left to each house's dis
cretion. (See B-10-b.)
(i. Recommended that house bills
be uniform in all women's resi
dences.
7. Recommended that freshman
women be informed about differ
ences in the types of women's liv
ing groups—i.e., it was felt that
smaller groups often demanded
more willingness to accept re
sponsibility (house duties, func
tions, etc.) on each girl's part,
whereas in larger groups a girl
can often be more independent.
R. RECOMMENDED METHOD FOR
CHOOSING LIVING GROUP
Because sororities have been abol
ished, and with them rushing, we
advocate the most natural and fair
plan we can think of.
1. During fall and winter quarters
of every year and up until the time
when drawing is to take place, there
should be social gatherings by which
freshmen and upperclassmen may
become well acquainted. These gath
erings may take several forms:
a) A program taking place over sev
eral days to enable the freshmen
to see the inside of all. the wom
en's residences.
b) Informal get-togethers so that
freshmen and upperclassmen may
become more than casually ac
quainted.
At this point the plan for the
social program that is now being
carried out is explained, which
we omit.)
2. Dining spring quarter there
should be a list published of the ap
proximate vacancies which will oc
cur in each living group the follow
ing quarter. This list should be pre
viously adjusted to provide an even
distribution of classes (sophomores,
juniors, seniors) in each residence,
because of the mutual benefit of con
tact among different classes. Also if
a house is run co-operatively, and
for reasons of group tradition and
spirit, continuity is felt to be a defi
nite need.
a) Any plan to establish class ratios
in a residence must be flexible;
that is, the residence itself must
have means of changing the ratio
if it so desires. In order that this
may be done, we suggest an ad
visory committee, which would
work closely with the University
residence staff, and which would
be informed of the particular
needs of the residences in regard
to classes. (See B-10-b.)
(Suggestion that for the present
the junior-senior class could be
considered one ratio group as it is
so hard to distinguish between
iuniors and seniors.)
Residence Changes
3. During the first part of spring
quarter the upperclassmen would
make any changes in residence which
they desire. We recommend that ii
be made clear to the freshmen that
the privilege of the upperclassmen
drawing first has been used in the
University for some time and has
been thought just because the
amount of time the upperclassmen
have left at Stanford is less than
that of the "reshmen.
Furthermore, the turnover of up
perclassmen is not great, and there
is still plenty of room for the fresh
men to move wherever they want.
We feel, too, that the class quota sys
tem will assure freshmen of places.
4. A little later in spring quarter
the freshmen would indicate their
preference for future living group.
Each girl would receive a card on
which a list of all the different
women's residences on the campus
would appear. We suggest that they
be listed in Ihree sections: Lagunita,
Union, and Row; but purely for (he
sake of clarity. A long maze of
strange names might complicate the
freshman's choice.
Five Preferences
The freshman would have five op
portunities for preference and would
mark 1, 2, 3, 4. 5 in the order of her
choice, by five different residences.
It would not be necessary for her to
keep within one unit, but she could
spread her marks over residences in
all three sections if she so desired.
(The recommendation that each
casa in Lagunita be considered an
individual unit would do away with
the existing priority which girls liv
ing within the unit have when
changing to another part of the
whole Lagunita unit.)
At this same time each freshman
would draw a number and those
with the lowest numbers would be
most likely to get their first prefer
ence. Tlie size of the number drawn,
plus the number of vacancies in the
class quotas of the residences she

has chosen, would determine her
final placement.
Drawing in Pairs
We recommend that freshmen
draw in pairs, because we feel that
it would reduce any feeling of iso
lation. It is administratively feas
ible. and it should be done purely on
a voluntary basis. The fact that a
freshman had a friend with her
might enable both of them to adjust
more easily to a new group and thus
facilitate congeniality,
5. Once it has been decided what
living group a freshman will go to
the following quarter, she may be
given a room within the residence.
Every residence should not be re
quired to make women draw for spe
cific rooms, but rather each one
should be able to settle on the meth
od of giving the new women their
rooms in their own way.
After a residence has been in
formed as to the girls who will live
in it next quarter, the old girls
should plan some sort of activity to
welcome the incoming group,
a) Recommended that house meet
ings be held at the end of spring
quarter, especially in former
sorority houses, to discuss with
the freshmen old house policies,
such as changing rooms each
quarter, duties, what the house
provides such as sheets, etc.
(1) Perhaps the freshmen would
decide to room together, at least
for the fifst quarter. In an case,
the old members of the house
should be encouraged to ask the
incoming girls what to do, rather
than ielling them.
(2) Recommended that there bo
some sort of a Row Excom to co
ordinate the group if need be, and
to represent it. This group would
include the Union co-ops, when
and if there are some.
(3) Recommended that house
presidents be elected at such time
that they carry over from spring
to fall; this will make spring plan
ning of full activities easier.
Permanent Member
G. Once a woman is in a unit she
is assured of being able to stay as
long as she is in Stanford, an under
graduate.
7. There should be adequate pro
vision for room drawing any quar
ter that a woman wishes to change
living groups.
a) Recommended that the quota
system be maintained every
quarter, as far as possible.
b) Recommended that a freshman
complete no less than three quar
ters in a freshman dormitory, and
that she may draw into upper
class residences any quarter she
reaches sophomore status.
8. Recommended that transfers be
proportioned among the various liv—

ing groups, and that they be allowed
to state whether they would prefer
a single or double room, and wheth
er they be placed in a more loosely
knit dorm or a more co-operative
type of residence.
a) Perhaps the Dean could send
them the pros and cons on the
subject of differences in living
groups.
Graduates
9. Recommended that Stanford
graduate women be allowed to con
tinue to live in their former resi
dences, unless total undergraduate
enrollment makes this impossible,
a) Recommended that Casa Ventura
He made a co-operative graduate
women's residence as soon as pos
sible.

10. Because this plan is the least
like a system that we can fairly
devise and we realize that there will
be difficulties and perhaps need for
unified women's action, and because
J we hope that this plan will provide
the best framework for a way of liv
ing, and therefore will grow in the
living of it. we recommend:
a) That the Housing Committee
continue spring quarter; there
fore there is need for a new
chairman.
b) That a permanent committee be
set up (representation not yet de
termined):
(1) To co-ordinate social pol
icy, if need be.
(2) To allow flexibility in class

I ratios, working on this along
with the residences and the Uni
versity residence staff.
(3) To carry forth efforts to
promote congeniality in each liv
ing group and generally judge
the success of the plan as it goes
along.
(•I) That this permanent com
mittee he a sub-committee of
Women's Conference, which does
not mean necessarily that it he
composed of members of Con
ference.
The committee further
mends that the existing dormitory
system may be improved through
the common exchange of ideas, and
that there be leadership education.
