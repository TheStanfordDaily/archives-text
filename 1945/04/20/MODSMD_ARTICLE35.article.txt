# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
The ump's third official appearance
behind the plate finds interest in
baseball throughout the nation pick
ing up, as the two major leagues
swing into their first week of play.
Before he gets too far behind in his
calling, thprefore, he has decided to
tell you who is going to win the
coveted flags, so you can rest with
assurance through the rest of the
season while the poor bedeviled fans
who are unlucky enough to miss this
column spend the next four months
in an agony of worry.
American League
The junior circuit is the toughest
to call, and by all odds should pro
vide an exciting race. Here's the
verdict:
1. St. Louis
2. Detroit
3. New York
4. Boston
5. Chicago
6. Cleveland

7. Philadelphia
8. Washington
Yes, we take the Brownies again
for the pennant. It's virtually a
toss-up with the potent Detroit Ti
gers, but Luke Sewell of St. Louis
has everything he had last year,
which was enough, plus perhaps a
little more; while the Tigers are
without the services of stellar Dick
Wakefield and one or two other key
men. The Browns' only important
loss to date is pitcher Denny Gale
house, but they are still left with
Nelson Potter, Jack Kramer, Sig
Jackuki, and Bob Muncrief on the
mound staff, which should be enough
to last the season nicely. One of the
league's better infields should aid
the Cinderella kids considerably, led
by the reliable Vern Stephens.
Here's a tip: keep your eye on first
sacker George McQuinn. The ump
has a hunch he's going to develop
into one of the best hitters on the
American League.
As for the rest of the circuit: the
Yanks have far too much left to be
overlooked. They may well give both
St. Louis and Detroit a run for their
money, and will certainly find no
difficulty landing in the first division.
For the others it will be a mad
scramble. Various and sundry in
formation leads us to deduce that
they will finish in something like the
above-indicated order.
National League
The National League looks like the
same old story from here, which goes
as follows:
1. St. Louis
2. Pittsburgh
3. Cincinnati
4. New York
5. Chicago
(i. Philadelphia
7. Boston
8. Brooklyn
The selection requires little dis
cussion. It will take more than any
one else in the loop has to stop the
rampaging Cards for a long time yet;
but look for increased trouble from
the direction of Pittsburgh and Cin
cinatti. The Giants are steadily

climbing and should fill out the first
division. The rest of 'em stack up
as indicated.
The first couple of days of play are
hardly enough to confirm or refute
the umpire's verdict, but they may
be significant. In the American, St.
Louis knocked the mighty Hal New
houser of Detroit around to take the
opener, 7-1; causing the ump, who
is very partial to the Brownies, to
dance a jig behind home plate. The
next day found him in different
spirits as the Tigers came back
strong, 11-0.
