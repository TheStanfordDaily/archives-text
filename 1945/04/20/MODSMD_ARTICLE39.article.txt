# 'Black Boy' Records Tragedy Of Negroes and Poor Whites
## 
### Richard Wright (Harper Brothers) 228 pp. $2. 50 
This book is the autobiography of
a Negro who spent his early life in
the Southern states. It is unavoidab
ly concerned with the relations exist
ing there between the white and the
colored people and their impact on
the author. It is a book, therefore,
that no American who values his
peace of mind should read.
Whether or not the raw violence
that Mr. Wright feels lying close to
the surface of all dealings of white
men with black actually exists, is
not the question; whether his fears
were always grounded or not they
were real. With fear and hatred,
poverty and humiliation as the daily
attendants of his childhood, it is
surprising that Mr. Wright has been
able to surmount the psychological
obstacles, let alone the social ones,
that separate the masses from the
few who are able to survey the world
by the light of their free intelligence

and pass on their feelings to each
other.
Not Whole Man
But having surmounted or evaded
these obstacles it is not, it could not
be, a whole man that comes through.
The vessel that weathers the storm
gets damaged in proportion to the
force of the tempest.
The triumph of Richard Wright
is to have produced a record such as
this one under review; a record pas
sionately written as it was passion
ately lived. The tragedy of Richard
Wright is that this same record tells
us how much more he might have
accomplished had the same strength
of mind, intellectual curiosity and
ambition been free to apply them
selves from the start.
Religious Element
There are, for example, perhaps no
passages in the book more interesting
than those that reveal the sterility of
Mr. Wright's feelings on religion.

Mr. Wright has the capacity for the
heightened feeling towards morals
that is the basis of religion, this book
itself gives ample testimony. His
genuine grief after committing theft
is evidence of this. But there is no
evidence in the whole autobiog
raphy that feelings such as these
were ever raised to the higher plane
of religious experience.
The strange, metaphysical dogmas
of the Seventh-Day Adventist
Church thwarted his natural devel
opment in this direction, depriving
him of the solace of religion and its
pertaining moral and cultural bene
fits. That is part of what I mean by
the tragedy of Richard Wright.
Fluent Style
Readers of this book will find it
fluent in style and fascinating in
content. The author has powers of
quiet observation that give the touch
of truth to his descriptions of peo
ple.
The general story of the attitude
of Southern Whites towards Negroes
is well known; the present narrative
relates its effect on the personalities
and actions of both races. It would
be hard to say which of the two has
suffered the greater psychological
damage as a resuIt.—SYDNEY

than those that reveal the sterility of
Mr. Wright's feelings on religion.

Mr. Wright has the capacity for the
heightened feeling towards morals
that is the basis of religion, this book
itself gives ample testimony. His
genuine grief after committing theft
is evidence of this. But there is no
evidence in the whole autobiog
raphy that feelings such as these
were ever raised to the higher plane
of religious experience.
The strange, metaphysical dogmas
of the Seventh-Day Adventist
Church thwarted his natural devel
opment in this direction, depriving
him of the solace of religion and its
pertaining moral and cultural bene
fits. That is part of what I mean by
the tragedy of Richard Wright.
Fluent Style
Readers of this book will find it
fluent in style and fascinating in
content. The author has powers of
quiet observation that give the touch
of truth to his descriptions of peo
ple.
The general story of the attitude
of Southern Whites towards Negroes
is well known; the present narrative
relates its effect on the personalities
and actions of both races. It would
be hard to say which of the two has
suffered the greater psychological
damage as a resuIt.—SYDNEY

This book is the autobiography of
a Negro who spent his early life in
the Southern states. It is unavoidab
ly concerned with the relations exist
ing there between the white and the
colored people and their impact on
the author. It is a book, therefore,
that no American who values his
peace of mind should read.
Whether or not the raw violence
that Mr. Wright feels lying close to
the surface of all dealings of white
men with black actually exists, is
not the question; whether his fears
were always grounded or not they
were real. With fear and hatred,
poverty and humiliation as the daily
attendants of his childhood, it is
surprising that Mr. Wright has been
able to surmount the psychological
obstacles, let alone the social ones,
that separate the masses from the
few who are able to survey the world
by the light of their free intelligence

and pass on their feelings to each
other.
Not Whole Man
But having surmounted or evaded
these obstacles it is not, it could not
be, a whole man that comes through.
The vessel that weathers the storm
gets damaged in proportion to the
force of the tempest.
The triumph of Richard Wright
is to have produced a record such as
this one under review; a record pas
sionately written as it was passion
ately lived. The tragedy of Richard
Wright is that this same record tells
us how much more he might have
accomplished had the same strength
of mind, intellectual curiosity and
ambition been free to apply them
selves from the start.
Religious Element
There are, for example, perhaps no
passages in the book more interesting
than those that reveal the sterility of
Mr. Wright's feelings on religion.
