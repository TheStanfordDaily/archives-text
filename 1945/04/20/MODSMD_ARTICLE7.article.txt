## 
### 
LONDON, April 19 (UP). â€”The
Soviet high command announced to
night for the first time that its
armies were storming Berlin's ap
proaches on a 150-mile front and the
Germans said one of the bloodiest
battles of all time was raging almost
at the very gates of the doomed
Reich capital.
The German 'account said the Red
Army had captured three forts in
Berlin's defense ring and was attack
ing positions only nine miles from
the city limits. Soviet flanking
forces south of Berlin were said to '

have swept 32 miles, stormed across
Berlin's river, the Spree, and moved
within 25 miles of Dresden.
Soviet confirmation of the offensive
that enemy sources have been de
tailing for four days came in a com
munique broadcast by the Moscow
radio more than an hour after the
usual time. It announced that Rus
sian and Polish foi'ces had crossed
the Neisse on a broad front and cap
tured the big west bank fortress of
Forst and Weisswasser and Rothen
burg. The Germans had acknowl
-1 edged the loss of all three.
