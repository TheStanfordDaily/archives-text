# Yanks Capture Leipzig, Halle
## 
### 
PARIS, Friday, April 20 (UP).—
The American First Army captured
Leipzig and Halle yesterday, clear
ing the way for a drive to meet the
Russians some 65 miles away, while
the American Seventh Army won all
but a small corner of Nuernberg in
a penetration of the northern fringe
of the enemy's Bavarian redoubt.
Combined forces of the U.S. First
and Ninth Armies crushed the last
enemy resistance in the Ruhr, taking
316,930 prisoners in 18 days and in
flicting on the Nazis their worst de

bade of the entire war —greater than
even Stalingrad.
The fall of Leipzig and Halle to
Lieut. Gen. Courtney H. Hodges'
doughboys after hard street battles
caved in the western side of the
shrinking Nazi corridor between the
American and Red armies south of
Berlin. The First Army already had
by-passed Leipzig and was along or
across the Mulde River to the east
on a 23-mile front preparing to re
sume what was officially described as
the next phase of the European war.
