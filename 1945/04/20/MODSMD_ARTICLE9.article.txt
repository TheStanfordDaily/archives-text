MANILA, Friday, April 20 (UP).
American troops have seized Bala
bac Island, south of Palawan Island
and only 45 miles from the north
tip of Borneo, posing a new threat to
that pillar of Japan's stolen empire,
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur announced
today. Other American troops al
ready had occupied Tawi Tawi Is
land on the southern end of the Sulu
archipelago, barely 30 miles from
Borneo.
The new landing on which Mac-
Arthur gave no details, is 265 miles
northwest of Tawi Tawi, and gives
his forces two sets of "stepping
stones" toward the rich East Indies.
