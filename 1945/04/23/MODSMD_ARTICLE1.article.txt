activities of the United Nations re
lief the late President Roosevelt said
in a message to Congress: "In oc

ple have died from exposure due to
lack of adequate clothing as have
died from starvation."
National Goal
To relieve this great need the UN
CC has set a national goal of 150,-
000,000 pounds of clothing for free
distribution among the 125,000,000
men, women, and children in war
devastated Europe. What is needed
by these people is good, substantial
used clothing for both winter and
summer wear.
The types of clothes most urgently
needed are infants' garments, men's
and boys' clothing—overcoats, suits,
coats, shirts, work clothes, sweaters,
underwear, pajamas; women's and
girls' garments — overcoats, skirts,
sweaters, shawls, dresses, underwear,
and nightwear. Needed as well are
caps and knitted headwear, all types
of bedding in serviceable condition,
any shoes of durable type with low
or medium heels, and any usable
remnants or piece goods over a yard
in length.
Final Collections
The living group representatives
will take the clothing collected to
Woodpecker Lodge on Tuesday be
tween 1 and 5 p.m. where it will be
sorted, packed, and labeled for ship
