awarded to the men's and women's
living groups scoring highest in the

Coney Island Capers is the label
given to the Carnival by chairman

the conglomeration of ice cream,
beach towels, swimmers, and sun-tan
oil at the Stanford Boathouse will be
the nearest thing to Coney Island
that ever hit the West Coast.
Two comic divers from the Olym
pic Club in San Francisco will dive
waterward from the top of the Boat
house, marking the halfway point in
the water events. A pageant of floats
will decorate the lake front, as liv
ing-groups enter the competition for
the prize float built atop a University
canoe.
At noon today sign-up sheets will
be distributed among living groups,

practice.
