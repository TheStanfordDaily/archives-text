# Where Are Dimes for Diplomas?
## 
### 
One of the many lags in our thinking and
doing was revealed the other day, when it sud
denly came to our attention that Stanford was,
all of the mere talk to the contrary notwith
standing, way behind the tempo of the ap
proaching times.
At the beginning of the war when men were
pulled from behind Reserve Book Room texts
to the training camps, it was seen that for
many of them the chance of finishing school at
all was greatly diminished.
At that time Stanford's "Dimes for Diplo
mas" campaign was started,.and every Wednes
day on Quad there were collections for our
dimes to go toward a fund from which Stanford
veterans might someday receive aid in finish
ing their work at school.
When the campaigns for various other things
started growing too, all were combined in one
sizeable fee that now is collected at the begin
ning of the year. Hence "Dimes for Diplomas"
has passed from our conscious attention.
And altogether too much so. Last week some
one suddenly realized that several thousand
dollars in the fund has been lying idle as
guarter after guarter more veterans were re
turning.
* Wednesday Excom relegated the problem to
the student manager with the suggestion of
making it a "memorial fund." This is all that
has been done with this money.
There is really an opportunity here for Stan
ford students to show their concern for fellow
students who have not been able to be here
during the war, by the wise and considered
admiinstration of this fund.
It is a way to show that their absence means
more to us than just our now minimized activi
ties because of it.
The G.I. Bill of Rights makes it possible for
veterans to come to Stanford by doing some
part-time work.
There are many instances in the veterans'
education that could be provided for by this
money. The G.I. bill only provides for one
year of school in cases where the veteran
served less than a year. Some veterans may not
be able to do extra work. At present the
'Dimes" fund seems to be for Stanford men
Dnly; perhaps the possibility of helping other
/eterans to come here should be investigated.
Another item is the fact that the money has
oeen accepted by the University under the
egular scholarship rule that it is not to be given
■o those covered by the G.I. Bill of Rights.
Students would have to investigate other
possibilities, or ways of circumventing these
uies. If it were undertaken with determination
u inake this money work for the veterans and
Mrtnford's benefit, perhaps a permanent stu
.lent-faculty-administration committee could be
vorked out for interviews.
It seems certain that something should be

done so that these funds may be publicized by
next fall quarter.
This money belongs to all Stanford students
to be used for veterans, and the students must
certainly have ideas about its administration.
Veterans on campus are in a position to know
the possibilities best. With Executive Commit
tee, our columns are open to your ideas.

next fall quarter.
This money belongs to all Stanford students
to be used for veterans, and the students must
certainly have ideas about its administration.
Veterans on campus are in a position to know
the possibilities best. With Executive Commit
tee, our columns are open to your ideas.
One of the many lags in our thinking and
doing was revealed the other day, when it sud
denly came to our attention that Stanford was,
all of the mere talk to the contrary notwith
standing, way behind the tempo of the ap
proaching times.
At the beginning of the war when men were
pulled from behind Reserve Book Room texts
to the training camps, it was seen that for
many of them the chance of finishing school at
all was greatly diminished.
At that time Stanford's "Dimes for Diplo
mas" campaign was started,.and every Wednes
day on Quad there were collections for our
dimes to go toward a fund from which Stanford
veterans might someday receive aid in finish
ing their work at school.
When the campaigns for various other things
started growing too, all were combined in one
sizeable fee that now is collected at the begin
ning of the year. Hence "Dimes for Diplomas"
has passed from our conscious attention.
And altogether too much so. Last week some
one suddenly realized that several thousand
dollars in the fund has been lying idle as
guarter after guarter more veterans were re
turning.
* Wednesday Excom relegated the problem to
the student manager with the suggestion of
making it a "memorial fund." This is all that
has been done with this money.
There is really an opportunity here for Stan
ford students to show their concern for fellow
students who have not been able to be here
during the war, by the wise and considered
admiinstration of this fund.
It is a way to show that their absence means
more to us than just our now minimized activi
ties because of it.
The G.I. Bill of Rights makes it possible for
veterans to come to Stanford by doing some
part-time work.
There are many instances in the veterans'
education that could be provided for by this
money. The G.I. bill only provides for one
year of school in cases where the veteran
served less than a year. Some veterans may not
be able to do extra work. At present the
'Dimes" fund seems to be for Stanford men
Dnly; perhaps the possibility of helping other
/eterans to come here should be investigated.
Another item is the fact that the money has
oeen accepted by the University under the
egular scholarship rule that it is not to be given
■o those covered by the G.I. Bill of Rights.
Students would have to investigate other
possibilities, or ways of circumventing these
uies. If it were undertaken with determination
u inake this money work for the veterans and
Mrtnford's benefit, perhaps a permanent stu
.lent-faculty-administration committee could be
vorked out for interviews.
It seems certain that something should be

done so that these funds may be publicized by
next fall quarter.
