A junction between the Allied and Russian
armies is imminent, and this will mean that
Berlin will be completely cut off. The morale
of the garrison is not known, and this will be
the chief determining factor influencing the
length of the siege.
Its completion will divide the Germans into
two compartments, to Berlin's north and to
its south. Also, it will eliminate the main dumps
of the remaining enemy forces in this area, and
also the remaining war industry.
Some of the Germans on the southern end of
the Berlin front are trying to slip out into the
Bavarian Alps by way of Czechoslovakia, but
General Patton, driving into this flank, has sud
denly pivoted southward, heading to cut their
escape routes, and probably thinking that Mar
shal Konev, hitting at the German rear, will
make the enemy think twice before hitting the
Third Army in flank.
But the Germans have managed to get twelve
divisions into the Bavarian Alps, where they
have their so-called "national redoubt." How
ever, this force has been pushed back from
Nuernberg, and at last reports the line of the
Danube had been breached. That would force
the enemy all the way back to the lakes and
rivulets around Munich, or else would leave
them to be massacred in the open country.
The Germans in the redoubt, however, could
be starved out in a matter of time, or could be
pried out if our commanders thought that, with
regard to the Pacific War, casualties were less
important than time. That seems to be the big
gest military question of importance in Ger
many just now.
