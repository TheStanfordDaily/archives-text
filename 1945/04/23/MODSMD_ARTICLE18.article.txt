### PEGGY FITTS 
Sights and Sounds Department:
Characters in black cloaks and green eye
shades pilfering the pansy patch in Union Court
and carrying off the proceeds in what used to
be 'known as tooth glasses. (Made from old
teeth.)
The popcorn fans in the Stanford Theater,
gnawing their toasted vegetables right before
the bulging eyes of Laird Cregar and Co., the
Square from Hangover.
Three of the kids in an intense huddle over
the community weed—(they pass it around,
y'know)—"Well, why do we have to read his
book? That's what I wanna know!"
The popular professor standing in front of
the Cellar on a blue Tuesday, solemnly rolling
his own.
The two dear little old ladies (they never
fail) at the Orchesis concert, struck by the sight
of a couple of blacked-out dancers in blue jeans
(leotards are longer this year>. "My, the boys
are getting small!"
The music-loving taxi-driver, returning from
L'Ommie's with a gay party of pancake fanciers,
and suddenly bursting out with a soulful
"Geeeeeez! If I had my electric guitar, we
could park right here and have a community
sing!"
The cokeless coke machine in tthe Daily
shack—you put in your nickel and you get
Tchaikovsky. (Come out of there, Smith!)
The bent-hat-and-overalls boys in the Inner
Quad, resting philosophically on their rakes to
watch the passage of a little girl carrying a
dumb-bell. "Ahhhh! Stoodents!"
