# P.A.I. in Initial Contest Today

### JOHN GLATHE 
The Palo Alto Independent base
ball team will take to the field this
afternoon in its first encounter of
the season against Lincoln High of
San Jose. Game time is 3:45 on the
local diamond of Palo Alto High.
There is no definite line-up as yet.
according to Bob Rosburg, captain
and manager. The tentative line-up,
however, is as follows: catcher, Ed
Hall; pitcher, Doc Mason; first base.
Tom Hood; second base, Ted Mor
rison; short stop, Tom Ashley; third
base. Bob Rosburg; outfield, Luke
Pitts, Ray Ryan, Dennis Fox, and
Bob Slobe.
Although the P.A.I, nine have had
little practice, they should have at
least an even chance, and it will be
quite likely that they will come out
on the long end of the score. Hit
ting will be the main deficiency of
the Independents. Their fielding
should be good, but the main threat
of the P.A.I, attack is the pitching
of Doc Mason. Mason was first string
hurler on the last official Stanford
baseball team. His terriffic fastball
and baffling hook should cause the
boys from San Jose no end of trou
ble. The infield should be just about
air tight with Morrison and Ashley
forming the backbone. The outfield

is more or less an indefinite quantity
mainly clue to lack of experience.
This game is the first of a possible
fifteen game schedule. Captain -
manager Bob Rosburg has games
with high schools, junior colleges,
and service teams from around the
Bay area. There have been several
games scheduled for Sundays as
well as week days.
Because of the Administration's
present policy concerning athletics
this is Stanford's only outside con
tact in the realm of athletics. There
fore, we hope that the new P.A.I, will
receive full support from the entire
student body.
