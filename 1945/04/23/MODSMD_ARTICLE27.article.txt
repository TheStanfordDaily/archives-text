# Farm Still Favors Junk on Wheels
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
You wei'e 14, and you dreamed
about coming to college. You saw
carefree coeds, and lean, laughing
senior men, cruising about your
dream campus in sleek, shiny con
vertibles. You saw lots of things—
dances, and football games, and no
smoking on Quad—but mostly there
were visions of cars—white-sidewall
tires, aromatic leather seats, a dash
board full of meaningless knobs.
Then you came to Stanford —you
were at least 15 then — and found
that college students were driving
around in some of the noisiest, old
est, and weirdest models you'd im
agined, and apparently loved them.
Party Buggy
Take the Black Mariah, for in
stance. Known as "the best party
car on campus," and named for its
similarity to a police patrol-wagon,
this car has evaded junk-yards for
years by virtue of its phenomenal
energy and lengthy history. Bought
four years ago by Jean Richards
from a Berkeley wrecking yard, the
car looped down the highway to
Stanford where it has remained ever
since, first as the pride of Roble 38,
later as the hobby of the Pi Phi's,
and recently as the demon of the
Boathouse.
An iron grilling gives the back an
open-air effect, and the blue uphol
stery of the built-in benches, the
cream-colored decorations on the
windows (yes, it's got windows!) and
the signatures of all the students
who have ever been connected with
it add to its unique appearance. You
can't miss it—it's the truck with the
T-card on the front.

Claim to Fame
Miss Richards was uroud to tell
that Dr. Tresidder and Dean Yost
have both been passengers in the
| auto she once owned. 'Tis said that
neither minded at all that the gear
shifts exactly backward.
According to present owner Milt |
Levy, the screwdriver which acts as
ignition is much more fun than the
ordinai-y kind. The car runs per
fectly, can reach 50 m.p.h. with the
doors tied on.
The Black Mariah boasts a tool
box, five tires, and a horn operated |
with the fingers, a peeled wire, and !
plentiful sparks. It accommodates
12 passengers with ease and com
fort—or 17, for fun!
Oooh, Frankie!
Levy's prestige as owner of the
Mariah is being endangered by his j
Boathouse roommate, Frank de Lisle,
who owns a '22 model T. Veteran of
two trips to Carmel, and retained
solely for week-end use, de Lisle's
car, light green, may be identified
by the "Prince Albert Came in a Can,
Too" sign on its side, a remnant of
its days at Berkeley High.
A glance at the polka-dotted car
outside Lagunita, or Penny's cream
and-blue four-leaf colver enamel, or
at the files that contain the stories
about the D.G.-Monroe Hall Doge- j
mobile will convince you that tastes j
don't change much and that the '
junk-yard on wheels is here to stay.
