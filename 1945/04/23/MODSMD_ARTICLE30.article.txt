# Russian Tanks Drive Into Heart of Berlin
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Monday, April 23 (UP).
â€”Soviet tank columns early today
were rumbling down Berlin's broad
avenues leading to the Alexander
Platz, and the reported suicide forces
left to defend the city were believed
marooned by another Red Army
thrust south of the capital which had
cut the Berlin-Dresden highway.
Russian tanks and Cossack horse
men were reported fighting in the
center of Berlin last night after over
running one-fourth of the bux-ned
and battered Reich capital and cap
turing 20 of its suburbs.
