# Levy, Luce, Hiler, Dunn Lead Olympic Club to Win Over Cal
## 
### MORT COHEN 
Last Saturday, at the California
Invitational Meet, four Stanford men,
wearing the colors of the Winged-0
of the San Francisco Olympic Club
entered the meet and compiled a
record that would make any Stan
ford rooter, past, present, or future,
feel proud.
These four Stanford men had
nothing in common except a love for
track and a love for Stanford. One,
a lieutenant in the Navy, was once
the world's greatest discus tosser;
another, a graduate med. student,
was one of the outstanding weight
men of the past few years; the third
member, a senior, is ranked as one
of the top high-jumpers in inter
collegiate ranks; the fourth, a "mere"
freshman, was one of the best high
school dash men in California.
Levy Wins Dashes
These four men got together, at
the beckoning of ex-Stanford Mentor
Dink Templeton, and, with their
teammates, pounded out 69\'i points
to win the meet, far overshadowing
Cal's 44 ! j points, C.O.P.'s 19 points,
and the totals of the other five teams
entered.
In the second race of the day, Gor
don Levy, the freshman class presi
dent who ran in his first collegiate
meet, upset the field and took the
100-yard dash. The time, 10.7, was
very slow, but there was a strong
wind and everyone was slowed down
considerably. The U.C. man who
took third had been clocked at :10.3
a few days before.
And this was just the start, for
Levy came back a short time later to
cinch the 220-yard dash in :23.1.
Levy was the only dual winner of
the day and placed second on total
points. If he can keep up his good
work, and he shows every sign of
doing just that, he might develop
into one of the outstanding dash
men of this year.
In the field events, Ed Luce came
through as usual and took the high
jump at 6' 3'4". Luce has not been
beaten this year. As yet. he has not
been pressed, for there seems to be
very little good competition around
the Bay Area. Luce will probably
go back to the nationals, as he did
last year, and compete against the
best in the nation.
Hiller Again
In the discus, Emerson Hiler, the
med. student, and Lt. Gordon Dunn,
ex-Stanford weight man. took first
and second place respectively to lead
the field. Hiler reached 153' 9 7 a"
while Dunn tossed the platter 146'

8 n t". Add this to his third place in
the shot put at 44' 8", and one might
say that Lieutenant Dunn did very
well for himself.
About that time the U.C. rooters
were resigned to their fate. They
were forced to realize that, although
Stanford has officially banned inter
collegiate athletics for the duration,
the men of Stanford are still good
enough to push around their oppo
nenets, whenever and however the
occasion arises.
This year Cal will have to dream
of their teams of the past, of their
teams of Davis and Klemmer.
This year Stanford can watch and
be proud of its team, a team com
posed of Luce, Levy, Hiler and Dunn.
