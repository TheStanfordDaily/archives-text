# Series Goers To See Film On Philippines
## 
### 
Results of one of the United States'
greatest colonial experiments will
be shown in the documentary film, j
"Pledge to Bataan," at the Tuesday (
Evening Series in Memorial Hall at ,
7:30 tonight.
Produced by Herbert T. Edwards,
with photography by David Grif
fin, the film presents the Philippines' j
cultural background and the politi- i
cal, social, and economic progress of |
the Islands under the guidance of
the United States. It shows the cus
toms of the natives, whose forbearers j
came mainly from southeastern Ma
laya many centuries ago, and con- j
trasts the ancient Oriental with mod- j
ern American influences.
Filipinos' religious ceremonies, and
their agricultural, industrial, and
mineral development are all depicted
in this technicolor and sound film.
The picture deals largely with the ,
lives of the Philippine people—their I
cultivating of wheat and terraced
fields of rice, their weaving, log-cut
ting, and the way they are educated
and cared for in modern schools, i
preventoriums, and hospitals.
Manuel Quezon, late president of
the Philippine Commonwealth, has
said of "Pledge of Bataan," ''This j
picture is a magnificent achievement ■
of real historic importance. In it !
Americans have a chance to see the j
true Philippines, to understand the j
background and the way of life for j
which the Filipino people fought so
heroically side by side with the j
American soldiers . .
