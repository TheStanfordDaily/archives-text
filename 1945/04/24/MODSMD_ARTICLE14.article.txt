Advocating a program of mayhem, hot-foot,
and butchery isn't exactly in line with our pub
lic responsibility, or so we are told, but that's
our program for the amateur pilferers at dear
old Alma Mater who cannot curb their juvenile
tendencies long enough to leave posters hang
ing on Quad until after the event advertised is
over.
We hope that a brief program modeled after
the tactics of the S.S. Elite Guard might call
to their minds the considerable effort and time
reguired to make and hang these posters, and
perhaps it would — oh wish eternal! — even
cause Stanford students to protect the posters
from the hands of our petty nuisances!
