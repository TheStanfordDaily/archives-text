# THE 						MAN IN THE CLASSROOM

### 
Stanford students can't help but feel a touch
of pride for the due honor which is being paid
Stanford professors in the many responsible po
sitions with which they are being entrusted at
the San Francisco conference.
Sometimes we receive happy proof that pro
fessors do not continually frequent scholastic
towers. We witness now their contributions to
a puzzled world for which their knowledge
should be put to use more often than is usual.
Another point of pride with us is the manner
in which members of the Stanford faculty have
continued to serve with no complaint or slack
ening during the inconveniences and pressure
packed days of war. After a perhaps belated
recognition of their loyalty, we thank them for
this way of theirs, a way of always and incon
spicuously giving us their best.â€”N. S.
