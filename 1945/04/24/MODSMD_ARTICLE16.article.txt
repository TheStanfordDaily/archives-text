"Excuse me," said Alice politely, "but would you
mind telling me what y®u are doing?"
"We're digging a Dean-Proof Hole," said Tweedledee
in a very noisy whisper.
"A new and very confidential method for trapping
Deans," added Tweedledum in a low, secretive whis
per.
"But it looks to me as though it were just a big hole
in the ground," said Alice, puzzled at all this strange
secrecy.
Tweedledee and Tweedledum looked horribly of
fended.
"Oh dear!" cried Alice, "I really didn't mean to be
*o unappreciative. It's really a charming hole, but
'low does it work?"
"When the Deans are prowling about in the scary
darkness," said Tweedledee, brightening at her in
quiry. "since thev don't have luminous noses they
c-an't see where they are going, and tliev get lost and
tall into this hole and are trapped.' He smiled with
threat flee at the thought.
'Then why don't you call it a Dean-Catching Hole
nstead of a Dean-Proof Hole, if it's for catching
eans?" asked Alice.
'Because," said Tweedledum, "if it were a Dean-*
JaW iling Hole worthy of name it would have a Dean in
it, therefore it wouldn't be empty, therefore it
vouldn't be something where something isn't, there

fore it wouldn't be a hole, therefore it couldn't catch
Deans in the first place."
"Oli." said Alice (who was thoroughly muddled by
now, but didn't want to olTcnd their feelings again
by asking for another explanation), "but why do you
want to catch Deans; I thought that most people tried
to avoid them."
"Deans are horrible monsters!" declared Tweedledee
vehemently. "Awful unpleasant slithery things that
give one terrible nightmares." "Sort of hypocritical
hallucinations with legs on them," continued Tweedle
dum, shuddering at the thought, "and a thick scaly
skin and a sharp, barbed tail."
"Nonsense!" said Alice. "I don't believe a word of it.
The Walrus once pointed out a Dean to me, and he
was quite an innocent looking creature. Indeed, he
looked very much like poor Father William, except that
he was riding a velocipede."
Tweedledee and Tweedledum looked very crest
fallen. "Well, to tell the truth," confessed Tweedle
dee in a small, cautious voice, "they aren't really bad
creatures at all; in fact, occasionally I think they are
quite nice."
"But," explained Tweedledum, "it's such fun to criti
cize. It makes us feel almost grown up to be nasty
about authority. Unfortunately, since we aren't quite
clever enough to see what is really wrong, we have to
invent things or do a little exaggerating or imagining."
"Why, you're just a couple of silly children making
up scary stories about a perfectly harmless nuisance."
said Alice severely, "and I think you really ought to
be ashamed of yourselves."
"Confidentially, though," said Tweedledee to Alice,
whispering behind his hand, "it's really Tweedledum
who started it; I just joined in to have a little fun."
"What did you say?" asked Tweedledum, who had
heard the whole of the conversation.
"I said that it's very early in the spring for the rose
blossoms to bud," said Tweedledee, hiding behind Alice.
"No, you didn't!" screamed Tweedledum, hitting
Tweedledee over the head with his spade.
"Yes, I did!" screamed Tweedledee, hitting Tweedle
dum over the head with the pick handle.
'Round and 'round they they went, and Alice tried
desperately to dodge the blows that missed their
mark. Finally they both hit one another over the
head simultaneously, and collapsed into the Dean-
Proof Hole.
"It is probably very significant," thought Alice, "that
they fell into their own trap. However, I am much
more inclined to believe that it is all a lot of nonsense."

"It is probably very significant," thought Alice, "that
they fell into their own trap. However, I am much
more inclined to believe that it is all a lot of nonsense."

"Excuse me," said Alice politely, "but would you
mind telling me what y®u are doing?"
"We're digging a Dean-Proof Hole," said Tweedledee
in a very noisy whisper.
"A new and very confidential method for trapping
Deans," added Tweedledum in a low, secretive whis
per.
"But it looks to me as though it were just a big hole
in the ground," said Alice, puzzled at all this strange
secrecy.
Tweedledee and Tweedledum looked horribly of
fended.
"Oh dear!" cried Alice, "I really didn't mean to be
*o unappreciative. It's really a charming hole, but
'low does it work?"
"When the Deans are prowling about in the scary
darkness," said Tweedledee, brightening at her in
quiry. "since thev don't have luminous noses they
c-an't see where they are going, and tliev get lost and
tall into this hole and are trapped.' He smiled with
threat flee at the thought.
'Then why don't you call it a Dean-Catching Hole
nstead of a Dean-Proof Hole, if it's for catching
eans?" asked Alice.
'Because," said Tweedledum, "if it were a Dean-*
JaW iling Hole worthy of name it would have a Dean in
it, therefore it wouldn't be empty, therefore it
vouldn't be something where something isn't, there

fore it wouldn't be a hole, therefore it couldn't catch
Deans in the first place."
"Oli." said Alice (who was thoroughly muddled by
now, but didn't want to olTcnd their feelings again
by asking for another explanation), "but why do you
want to catch Deans; I thought that most people tried
to avoid them."
"Deans are horrible monsters!" declared Tweedledee
vehemently. "Awful unpleasant slithery things that
give one terrible nightmares." "Sort of hypocritical
hallucinations with legs on them," continued Tweedle
dum, shuddering at the thought, "and a thick scaly
skin and a sharp, barbed tail."
"Nonsense!" said Alice. "I don't believe a word of it.
The Walrus once pointed out a Dean to me, and he
was quite an innocent looking creature. Indeed, he
looked very much like poor Father William, except that
he was riding a velocipede."
Tweedledee and Tweedledum looked very crest
fallen. "Well, to tell the truth," confessed Tweedle
dee in a small, cautious voice, "they aren't really bad
creatures at all; in fact, occasionally I think they are
quite nice."
"But," explained Tweedledum, "it's such fun to criti
cize. It makes us feel almost grown up to be nasty
about authority. Unfortunately, since we aren't quite
clever enough to see what is really wrong, we have to
invent things or do a little exaggerating or imagining."
"Why, you're just a couple of silly children making
up scary stories about a perfectly harmless nuisance."
said Alice severely, "and I think you really ought to
be ashamed of yourselves."
"Confidentially, though," said Tweedledee to Alice,
whispering behind his hand, "it's really Tweedledum
who started it; I just joined in to have a little fun."
"What did you say?" asked Tweedledum, who had
heard the whole of the conversation.
"I said that it's very early in the spring for the rose
blossoms to bud," said Tweedledee, hiding behind Alice.
"No, you didn't!" screamed Tweedledum, hitting
Tweedledee over the head with his spade.
"Yes, I did!" screamed Tweedledee, hitting Tweedle
dum over the head with the pick handle.
'Round and 'round they they went, and Alice tried
desperately to dodge the blows that missed their
mark. Finally they both hit one another over the
head simultaneously, and collapsed into the Dean-
Proof Hole.
