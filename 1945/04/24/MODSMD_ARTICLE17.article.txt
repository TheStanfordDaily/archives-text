# World Peace Notesâ€”'45

### TED DRENTON 
John Foster Dulles, former chairman of the Com
mission for a Just and Durable Peace, and adviser to
Thomas E. Dewey, envisions the San Francisco Con
ference as an elemental start toward permanent peace. I
'"This beginning must be solidified," he states, and
proposes six "pillars of peace." These are: (1) A politi
cal framework for continuting collaboration of the
United Nations; (2) Inclusion within the scope of inter
national agreement economic and financial acts of gov- j
ernments which have widespread international reper
cussions; (3) Provision for changing treaty structures !
with changing underlying conditions; (4) An interna
tional organization to promote autonomy for subject i
peoples; (5) Control of material establishments every- j
where; and (G) Establishment not only in principle but j
in practice the right of individuals everywhere to re
ligious and intellectual liberty.
Control of Material Establishments
Most peoples of the world, I think, are in agreement
with these proposals as the minimum requirements for
world peace. One proposal of interest is number five,
control of material establishments everywhere.
The churches have proposed world socialism or. fn
other words, control in fact by the United Nations of
the great international business interests for the bene
fit of the people rather than for the few.
It is becoming increasingly obvious to world political
leaders of all complexions that international cartels are
operated by selfish interests and tend to stifle free world
trade, keeping large masses of people in poverty.
There have been many notorious associations be
tween American and German monopolies which have
kept up during the war. Well known is the war agree
ment between the Standard Oil Company in America
and the I. G. Farben Company in Germany, whereby
each company took care of the other's interests in their
respective countries. Certain American products could
not be manufactured during the war because German
concerns had patents to them.
After the war many new inventions such as gasless
automobiles that would be of immeasurable benefit*
to the people, will not be available because these in
ventions would deflate the income of the monopolies.
War and discord is welcomed by these interests as
increases in business. Unfortunately these interests
tend to control the politics of their own nations. As
an example the English government is accused of keep
ing the Indian people in continued subjection and ig- !
norance because the big business interests of England
can more easily profit by them.
Many sincere politicians who have the interest of j
their people at heart are conscious'of this economic
menace. President Roosevelt was aware of the dangers
inherent in the economic and political control of mon
opolistic interests and often spoke of their threat to
world security.
At Bretton Woods world legislation to regulate mon
opolies was proposed; and. I trust, that at the United
Nations Conference the far-sighted statesmen
bled there will act wisely upon these essential pro
posals basic to international human securitv.
