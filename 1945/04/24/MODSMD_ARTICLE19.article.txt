# Reviewer's Decision: No Objections to 'Objective'
## 
### 
"Objective, Burma," is a straight
war story—and a good one. It's just
a real story of real men, and one
operation hi Burma.
The movie starts with the an-

no un cement of
plans for the raid
and ends when
the men return
from that same
r aid. The re's
nothing spectacu
lar about it, un
less you could
call the grimy
business of being
hunted in a jun-

gle for days without food spectacu
lar.
The amazing thing about it is that
it contains very few Hollywood
tricks. You keep expecting the be
draggled fighters to find a detach
ment of nurses in a Burmese swamp,
or something similar, but it never
happens. In fact, there are no wo
men in the cast.
You get a true picture of the way
men talk and the things they do un
der tension. One particularly good
scene is when a force of Japs have
surrounded the 12 Americans dug in

on top of a Hill. The Americans have •
decided to silently sweat it out and i
let the enemy come after them. II I
you can get through that scene with
out shoving your feet clear through I
the back of the person sitting in front |
of you, more power.

Errol Flynn turns in a good per
formance as the leader of the squad
ron, though his courageousness is
a bit overdone. Despite his grueling
winter in court, Flynn still makes
an impressive hero.
The second feature at the Stanford
is a mess called "'Girl Rush." It's a
mixture of sage brush, Frances
Langford, covered wagons, peroxide

chorus girls, Red Creek in the midst
of a gold rush, and Aunt Emma. Be
sides that it has Stanford's most
successful spinster. Vera Vague, and
is full of too typical villings and
I hee-roes.
