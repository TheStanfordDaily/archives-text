# Monroe To Battle Buchanan
## 
### BOB GILKEY 
Monroe's powerful Boozers, fresh
from their crucial win over Phi Psi,
tackle an undefeated Buchanan team
in the feature tussle of the intra
mural Softball league today.
The Boozers, with three straight
triumphs to their credit, are seem
ingly headed for the league crown,
but if "Slugger" Hoffman, ace Bu
chanan pitcher, can silence the blud
geoning bats of Ed Luce, Bob Rbs
burg, and the rest of the Belting
Boozers, and if the Buchanan hitters
can solve the offerings of league
leading flinger Joe Sher, the Bear
cats might pull an upset. However,
those are mighty potent "ifs," and
Monroe must be regarded as a heavy
favorite.

i To date Monroe has defeated the
j Flacs 8-0. Tyler 11-3. and Phi Psi
i 3-2, while Buchanan holds a forfeit
win over USA and a 5-4 triumph
over the Legal Eagles.
