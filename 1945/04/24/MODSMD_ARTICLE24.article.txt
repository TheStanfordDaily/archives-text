# Quakers Work For Good-Will
## 
### 
By giving indiscriminate help to
the oppressed and conquered peo
ples of the world, the Quakers are
attempting to assure them of Ameri
can good-will and wish to help, said
Mr. Irwin Abrams in his talk to the
Y.W.C.A. yesterday.
Mr. Abrams, a former Stanford
history instructor, is now working
with the Friends Society in rehabili
tation and reconstruction, and is on
the West Coast recruiting people for
foreign service.
This good-will assurance, contin
ued Mr. Abrams. is necessary if a
durable peace is expected from any
conference. .
Quakers, he said, feel the oneness
of God, and in so doing dedicate
themselves to two principles: aiding
the suffering of humanity, and never
taking a lifeâ€”that is. becoming a
pacifist.
That does not mean, however, that
Quakers are not active in this war.
Many Quaker men are acting as
guinea pigs in scientific experiments;
they are offering themselves in dan
gerous experiments with malaria,
jaundice, mental institutions, and
semi-starvation cases.
Foreign work is being done in
China, India, Italy, Spain, France,
and the countries around France.
Clothes have been sent in. canteens
set up, medical relief offered, and
help given regardless of racial, reli
gious, or political beliefs.
