# Conference Delegates Face Polish Issue
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 24 (UP). â€”Statesmen of the United Nations,
their attention riveted on the stubborn Polish issue, assembled tonight for
the opening of deliberations tomorrow designed to erect the framework
of world machinery to keep the peace and guarantee security.
All of the major participants in the 46-nation gathering had arrived
with the exception of Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. He was due at
mid-evening by plane from Washington.
There was no indication of any progress in solution of the Polish
troubles and both Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., and Foreign
Commissar V. M. Molotov avoided any comment on that situation.
Stettinius, upon his arrival here, revealed that Russia had now joined
Britain, the United States, and China in supporting Chinese proposals to
strengthen the Dumbarton Oaks plan by specifying that principles of
"justice and international law" shall be the guide in settlement of inter-
national disputes. Molotov, when he arrived this afternoon, had nothing
w to say, but a colleague said that "now we can begin work."
