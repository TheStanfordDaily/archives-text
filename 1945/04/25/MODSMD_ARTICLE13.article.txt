# Units Entertain Sunday, Says Committee
## 
### 
Emphasizing to freshman women
the importance of meeting and
knowing women in all University
living units, members of the social
committee, sub-committee of Hous
ing Committee, decided yesterday to
continue the week-end social pro
gram, in spite of the fact that fresh
man women responded only half
heartedly to invitations issued by
nine units last Sunday.
Members of the social committee
have met with freshman women to
discover why so few of those who
had signed to visit the house actually
appeared, after units had planned
food and entertainment for them.
The social program, it is felt, is the
backbone of the housing plan which
has been accepted by the Board of
Trustees. Failure to take advantage
of opportunities for the promotion of
congeniality by the acquaintance of
new women with old will be detri
mental, if not fatal, to the success of
the plan as a whole, according to
committee members.
Russell, Manzanita, Durand, Roth,
The Chalet, Hurlburt, Cubberley,
and Jordan will entertain freshmen
Sunday. For convenience freshmen
are asked to stay in their groups and
visit houses at the designated hours.
All women should wear name tags.
Housing Committee, meeting yes
terday as a whole, discussed techni
cal details of the plan, which in
cluded payment of room deposits by
a-11 women May 7 and 8 to obtain
exact count of vacancies next fall
and to assure women rooms. Sum
mer room deposits will be paid later.
It was decided that freshmen
drawing in pairs would choose one
number only, which would deter
mine their unit assignment. Room
drawing for seniors, juniors, and
sophomores, in that order, will pre
cede that of the freshmen.
A panel discussion will be held in
freshman halls to explain the re
sponsibilities, duties, and functions
connected with all types of campus
living groups.
