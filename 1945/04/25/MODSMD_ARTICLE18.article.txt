# Secrecy, Power Are Obstacles of Everlasting Peace – Guerard
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
"My objection to Yalta is that ils
agreements were secret and every
thing there was based on power and
not on justice," said Dr. Albert Gue
rard at the Palo Alto Forum Mon
day evening. As an example of this,
Dr. Guerard pointed out the secret
agreement which allowed the United
States and Russia to have three votes
apiece at the San Francisco Con
ference.
Dr. Guerard said that he was glad
that the protests of the American
people resulted in our declining the
three vote privilege, because the
substitution of that kind of politics
for statesmanship won't work in the
creation of a new world order.
Fear of Secret Diplomacy
He declared that the people arc
still haunted by a fear of secret
diplomacy and declared that al
though the secrecy of Versailles
might possibly have saved six
months in 1919, we have since lost 25
years and ten million lives because
we did not establish "open covenants
openly arrived at."
"We must eliminate from the
peaceful world that we arc trying to
build, the idea of power and force
as an argument," continued the
speaker, "because power means

i purely and simply the idea of war."
In his plea to Hive the little fellow
a chance in the world organization,
Dr. Guerard rejected the idea that
the larger nations are right because
they arc big. He declared that the
American people and American dele
nates at the Conference should "re
sent and resist the power aspects of
| Dumbarton Oaks."
j Christian Unification
As a preface to his talk on "Prom
j ise of Association?- Cairo to Yalta
i and Chapultcpcc," Dr. Guerard pre
j .senled a brief history of previous
I proposals for world organization.
He began with a proposal made in
' HOG for unifiaction of the Christian
! countries of Europe, and mentioned
j briefly the attempts for world organ
! izalion of Rousseau, Kant, William
! Penn, George Washington —who call
; ed himself "a citizen of the republic
of humanity at large," and Victor
I Hugo—with his Universal Republic.
He continued by recalling Tcnny
j son's Federation of the World, the
i League to Enforce Peace, established
by President Taft and Lowell, and fi
nally the Covenant of the League of
Nations formulated by Woodrow
Wilson.
This persistant demand of human
| ity for international association can
I be interpreted in two ways declared

Dr. Guerard. Many people take a
cynical view of this long list of at
tempts at world peace and decide

that, we cannot abolish war any more
than we can abolish crime or sick
ness or death. The second point of
view, which he supports, is that
whatever man wills with sufficient
intensity and for a long enough time,
lie can achieve if it is humanly pos
sible.
Gucrard's Optimism
Dr. Guerard based him optimism
for a permanent peace on three ma
jor factors: (1) The failure of the
Paris Conference ought to have
taught us a lesson and impel us to
do a better job this time; (2) The
decline of frankly isolationist opinion
in recent years; and (i{) The example
of unity among the United Nations
during the past four or five years of
war.
In tracing the development of the
United Nations, Dr. Guerard desig
nated the Lend-Lease act of 1941
as the material foundation, and the
Atlantic Charter in the same year
as the moral foundation. He expres
sed disappointment that a general
economic staff of the United Nations
was not esablished at the same time,
stating that such an organization
would make the transition from war
to peace much easier.
S. F. Conference Strategic
The San Francisco Conference was


ALBERT GUERARI)
described by the speaker as the con
verging point of two scries of con
ferences which have been held dur
ing the past four years. The one
series, said Dr. Guerard, can be
called the executive or strategic con
ferences and include Casablanca,
Quebec, Moscow, Cairo, Teheran,
Quebec (II), Yalta, and Chaltepec.
These meetings were carried out by
the top men in the various nations
and were designed primarily for
planning the conduct of the war.
The second series includes the con
ferences of food and agriculture at
Atlantic City and Hot Springs, the
establishment of the United Nations
Relief and Rehabilitation Associa
tion, the Bretton Woods economic
conference, and the elaborate plan
formulated at Dumbarton Oaks.
Sharp DifTercnccs
Dr. Guerard pointed out that al
though it is encouraging to see the
people of the world getting together
to talk things over, the uneasy twi
light between the two world wars
was filled with all kinds of confer
ences and discussions. He also said
that the conference is meeting both
because they agree and because they
don't agree, and added that it would
be "too bad for the conference if
it didn't bring out some pretty sharp
differences of opinion."
In answer to warnings against the
danger of perfectionism, the speaker
declared that he could not remember
a case in history of things spoiled by
perfectionism, stating that the people
who killed the League of Nations
were certainly not the perfectionists
of that time. He further pointed out
that whenever we want to disregai'd
honesty or intelligence we say that

we must be "realistic" and throw our
ideals overboard.

Dr. Guerard spoke at the second of
six weekly forums on the San Fran

tempts at world peace and decide

that, we cannot abolish war any more
than we can abolish crime or sick
ness or death. The second point of
view, which he supports, is that
whatever man wills with sufficient
intensity and for a long enough time,
lie can achieve if it is humanly pos
sible.
Gucrard's Optimism
Dr. Guerard based him optimism
for a permanent peace on three ma
jor factors: (1) The failure of the
Paris Conference ought to have
taught us a lesson and impel us to
do a better job this time; (2) The
decline of frankly isolationist opinion
in recent years; and (i{) The example
of unity among the United Nations
during the past four or five years of
war.
In tracing the development of the
United Nations, Dr. Guerard desig
nated the Lend-Lease act of 1941
as the material foundation, and the
Atlantic Charter in the same year
as the moral foundation. He expres
sed disappointment that a general
economic staff of the United Nations
was not esablished at the same time,
stating that such an organization
would make the transition from war
to peace much easier.
S. F. Conference Strategic
The San Francisco Conference was


ALBERT GUERARI)
described by the speaker as the con
verging point of two scries of con
ferences which have been held dur
ing the past four years. The one
series, said Dr. Guerard, can be
called the executive or strategic con
ferences and include Casablanca,
Quebec, Moscow, Cairo, Teheran,
Quebec (II), Yalta, and Chaltepec.
These meetings were carried out by
the top men in the various nations
and were designed primarily for
planning the conduct of the war.
The second series includes the con
ferences of food and agriculture at
Atlantic City and Hot Springs, the
establishment of the United Nations
Relief and Rehabilitation Associa
tion, the Bretton Woods economic
conference, and the elaborate plan
formulated at Dumbarton Oaks.
Sharp DifTercnccs
Dr. Guerard pointed out that al
though it is encouraging to see the
people of the world getting together
to talk things over, the uneasy twi
light between the two world wars
was filled with all kinds of confer
ences and discussions. He also said
that the conference is meeting both
because they agree and because they
don't agree, and added that it would
be "too bad for the conference if
it didn't bring out some pretty sharp
differences of opinion."
In answer to warnings against the
danger of perfectionism, the speaker
declared that he could not remember
a case in history of things spoiled by
perfectionism, stating that the people
who killed the League of Nations
were certainly not the perfectionists
of that time. He further pointed out
that whenever we want to disregai'd
honesty or intelligence we say that

we must be "realistic" and throw our
ideals overboard.
Not Pcrfcction
Dr. Guerard spoke at the second of
six weekly forums on the San Fran
cisco Conference being held at the
Palo Alto Senior High School Audi
torium under the auspices of the
Palo Alto Department of Adult Edu
cation.
The next meeting will present Dr.
George Dowrie, professor of finance
in the Graduate School of Business
speaking on "The First Draft for a
World Financial and Economic Asso
ciation—the Bretton Woods Agree
ment."
"My objection to Yalta is that ils
agreements were secret and every
thing there was based on power and
not on justice," said Dr. Albert Gue
rard at the Palo Alto Forum Mon
day evening. As an example of this,
Dr. Guerard pointed out the secret
agreement which allowed the United
States and Russia to have three votes
apiece at the San Francisco Con
ference.
Dr. Guerard said that he was glad
that the protests of the American
people resulted in our declining the
three vote privilege, because the
substitution of that kind of politics
for statesmanship won't work in the
creation of a new world order.
Fear of Secret Diplomacy
He declared that the people arc
still haunted by a fear of secret
diplomacy and declared that al
though the secrecy of Versailles
might possibly have saved six
months in 1919, we have since lost 25
years and ten million lives because
we did not establish "open covenants
openly arrived at."
"We must eliminate from the
peaceful world that we arc trying to
build, the idea of power and force
as an argument," continued the
speaker, "because power means

i purely and simply the idea of war."
In his plea to Hive the little fellow
a chance in the world organization,
Dr. Guerard rejected the idea that
the larger nations are right because
they arc big. He declared that the
American people and American dele
nates at the Conference should "re
sent and resist the power aspects of
| Dumbarton Oaks."
j Christian Unification
As a preface to his talk on "Prom
j ise of Association?- Cairo to Yalta
i and Chapultcpcc," Dr. Guerard pre
j .senled a brief history of previous
I proposals for world organization.
He began with a proposal made in
' HOG for unifiaction of the Christian
! countries of Europe, and mentioned
j briefly the attempts for world organ
! izalion of Rousseau, Kant, William
! Penn, George Washington —who call
; ed himself "a citizen of the republic
of humanity at large," and Victor
I Hugo—with his Universal Republic.
He continued by recalling Tcnny
j son's Federation of the World, the
i League to Enforce Peace, established
by President Taft and Lowell, and fi
nally the Covenant of the League of
Nations formulated by Woodrow
Wilson.

In answer to warnings against the
danger of perfectionism, the speaker
declared that he could not remember
a case in history of things spoiled by
perfectionism, stating that the people
who killed the League of Nations
were certainly not the perfectionists
of that time. He further pointed out
that whenever we want to disregai'd
honesty or intelligence we say that

we must be "realistic" and throw our
ideals overboard.

Dr. Guerard spoke at the second of
six weekly forums on the San Fran
cisco Conference being held at the
Palo Alto Senior High School Audi
torium under the auspices of the
Palo Alto Department of Adult Edu
cation.
The next meeting will present Dr.
George Dowrie, professor of finance
in the Graduate School of Business
speaking on "The First Draft for a
World Financial and Economic Asso
ciation—the Bretton Woods Agree
ment."
"My objection to Yalta is that ils
agreements were secret and every
thing there was based on power and
not on justice," said Dr. Albert Gue
rard at the Palo Alto Forum Mon
day evening. As an example of this,
Dr. Guerard pointed out the secret
agreement which allowed the United
States and Russia to have three votes
apiece at the San Francisco Con
ference.
Dr. Guerard said that he was glad
that the protests of the American
people resulted in our declining the
three vote privilege, because the
substitution of that kind of politics
for statesmanship won't work in the
creation of a new world order.
Fear of Secret Diplomacy
He declared that the people arc
still haunted by a fear of secret
diplomacy and declared that al
though the secrecy of Versailles
might possibly have saved six
months in 1919, we have since lost 25
years and ten million lives because
we did not establish "open covenants
openly arrived at."
"We must eliminate from the
peaceful world that we arc trying to
build, the idea of power and force
as an argument," continued the
speaker, "because power means

i purely and simply the idea of war."
In his plea to Hive the little fellow
a chance in the world organization,
Dr. Guerard rejected the idea that
the larger nations are right because
they arc big. He declared that the
American people and American dele
nates at the Conference should "re
sent and resist the power aspects of
| Dumbarton Oaks."
j Christian Unification
As a preface to his talk on "Prom
j ise of Association?- Cairo to Yalta
i and Chapultcpcc," Dr. Guerard pre
j .senled a brief history of previous
I proposals for world organization.
He began with a proposal made in
' HOG for unifiaction of the Christian
! countries of Europe, and mentioned
j briefly the attempts for world organ
! izalion of Rousseau, Kant, William
! Penn, George Washington —who call
; ed himself "a citizen of the republic
of humanity at large," and Victor
I Hugo—with his Universal Republic.
He continued by recalling Tcnny
j son's Federation of the World, the
i League to Enforce Peace, established
by President Taft and Lowell, and fi
nally the Covenant of the League of
Nations formulated by Woodrow
Wilson.
This persistant demand of human
| ity for international association can
I be interpreted in two ways declared

Dr. Guerard. Many people take a
cynical view of this long list of at
tempts at world peace and decide

that, we cannot abolish war any more
than we can abolish crime or sick
ness or death. The second point of
view, which he supports, is that
whatever man wills with sufficient
intensity and for a long enough time,
lie can achieve if it is humanly pos
sible.
Gucrard's Optimism
Dr. Guerard based him optimism
for a permanent peace on three ma
jor factors: (1) The failure of the
Paris Conference ought to have
taught us a lesson and impel us to
do a better job this time; (2) The
decline of frankly isolationist opinion
in recent years; and (i{) The example
of unity among the United Nations
during the past four or five years of
war.
In tracing the development of the
United Nations, Dr. Guerard desig
nated the Lend-Lease act of 1941
as the material foundation, and the
Atlantic Charter in the same year
as the moral foundation. He expres
sed disappointment that a general
economic staff of the United Nations
was not esablished at the same time,
stating that such an organization
would make the transition from war
to peace much easier.
S. F. Conference Strategic
The San Francisco Conference was


ALBERT GUERARI)
described by the speaker as the con
verging point of two scries of con
ferences which have been held dur
ing the past four years. The one
series, said Dr. Guerard, can be
called the executive or strategic con
ferences and include Casablanca,
Quebec, Moscow, Cairo, Teheran,
Quebec (II), Yalta, and Chaltepec.
These meetings were carried out by
the top men in the various nations
and were designed primarily for
planning the conduct of the war.
The second series includes the con
ferences of food and agriculture at
Atlantic City and Hot Springs, the
establishment of the United Nations
Relief and Rehabilitation Associa
tion, the Bretton Woods economic
conference, and the elaborate plan
formulated at Dumbarton Oaks.
Sharp DifTercnccs
Dr. Guerard pointed out that al
though it is encouraging to see the
people of the world getting together
to talk things over, the uneasy twi
light between the two world wars
was filled with all kinds of confer
ences and discussions. He also said
that the conference is meeting both
because they agree and because they
don't agree, and added that it would
be "too bad for the conference if
it didn't bring out some pretty sharp
differences of opinion."
In answer to warnings against the
