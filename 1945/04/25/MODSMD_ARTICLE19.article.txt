# Chills, Spills in Store For Carnival-Goers
## Thirteen Units Enter Float Competition 
### 
Tense moments (diving exhibi
tion), spills (log-rolling contest),
laughs (nightgown race), chills (that
lake is cold!), beautiful concession
girls, food, gold trophies to lure on
the ambitious, and ye olde Califor
nia sun—will combine to bring Stan
ford students the best Junior Water
Carnival yet attempted, claim chair
men of the Coney Island Capers.
Thirteen living groups have def
initely entered the float competi
tion, anounced Ruth Maxwell. So
far the entrants are Cubberley
House, Jordan House, Lathrop

House, Lagunita, Casa Ventura,
Russell House, Alpha Kappa
Lambda fraternity, Roth House,
Storey House, Union Unit, The
Chalet, and Roble Hall.
Special acts are being planned by
Norman Hanley and Clyde Diaz,
comic divers coming from the Olym
pic Club in San Francisco for the
Carnival. The pair will perform
halfway in the program with a skit
including costumes and distracting
dialogue.
Barbara Beardslee, chairman of
the Carnival, reminds everyone to
sign up now for the races and spe
cial events. As publicity, a quar
tette of four, Ric Supple, Joe Sher,
Gracie Campbell, and Marianne
Supple, are touring the living groups,
dressed suitably for the occasion—
swim suits of the 1890's, heyday of
Coney Islands.
Choose your event or events now,
urges Marian Bush, junior class sec
retary. Competition is limited in
each race. Only one contestant, for
instance, can enter the balloon race
for women. One team of two from
each living group may enter the
jousting contest. Reminiscent of
tournaments of old when mounted
knights in armor charged with raised
lances, this contest will substitute
canoes for horses and poles covered
with boxing gloves for lances.
There's 110 limit in the canoe
filling contest, just as many as
you can muster. But Miss Bush
advises using the thinnest persons
available. In case some are in
doubt, the delicate art of gunnel
ing consists in balancing lightly
on the stern of the canoe and
gently propelling it forward by
bouncing. Very tricky! Come and
watch. Only one girl may enter
from each house.
Co-ordination will be important
for the log-rolling contest, one man
from cach living group. The log
will be long enough for all contest
ants to spin the log at. the same time
—even if some hit the drink on the
first round.
The nightgown race for women
calls for two women from each
house. Competing teams will swim
to the float, don gowns and try for
the shore.
Two changes have been made In
committee chairmen. Milton Levy
will be in charge of events, and
Patty Whittcmorc will take over re
freshments.

instance, can enter the balloon race
for women. One team of two from
each living group may enter the
jousting contest. Reminiscent of
tournaments of old when mounted
knights in armor charged with raised
lances, this contest will substitute
canoes for horses and poles covered
with boxing gloves for lances.
There's 110 limit in the canoe
filling contest, just as many as
you can muster. But Miss Bush
advises using the thinnest persons
available. In case some are in
doubt, the delicate art of gunnel
ing consists in balancing lightly
on the stern of the canoe and
gently propelling it forward by
bouncing. Very tricky! Come and
watch. Only one girl may enter
from each house.
Co-ordination will be important
for the log-rolling contest, one man
from cach living group. The log
will be long enough for all contest
ants to spin the log at. the same time
—even if some hit the drink on the
first round.
The nightgown race for women
calls for two women from each
house. Competing teams will swim
to the float, don gowns and try for
the shore.
Two changes have been made In
committee chairmen. Milton Levy
will be in charge of events, and
Patty Whittcmorc will take over re
freshments.
Tense moments (diving exhibi
tion), spills (log-rolling contest),
laughs (nightgown race), chills (that
lake is cold!), beautiful concession
girls, food, gold trophies to lure on
the ambitious, and ye olde Califor
nia sun—will combine to bring Stan
ford students the best Junior Water
Carnival yet attempted, claim chair
men of the Coney Island Capers.
Thirteen living groups have def
initely entered the float competi
tion, anounced Ruth Maxwell. So
far the entrants are Cubberley
House, Jordan House, Lathrop

House, Lagunita, Casa Ventura,
Russell House, Alpha Kappa
Lambda fraternity, Roth House,
Storey House, Union Unit, The
Chalet, and Roble Hall.
Special acts are being planned by
Norman Hanley and Clyde Diaz,
comic divers coming from the Olym
pic Club in San Francisco for the
Carnival. The pair will perform
halfway in the program with a skit
including costumes and distracting
dialogue.
Barbara Beardslee, chairman of
the Carnival, reminds everyone to
sign up now for the races and spe
cial events. As publicity, a quar
tette of four, Ric Supple, Joe Sher,
Gracie Campbell, and Marianne
Supple, are touring the living groups,
dressed suitably for the occasion—
swim suits of the 1890's, heyday of
Coney Islands.
Choose your event or events now,
urges Marian Bush, junior class sec
retary. Competition is limited in
each race. Only one contestant, for
