# SHAPING TOMORROW'S WORLD
## 
### 
Today in San Francisco was begun what may
well be one of the most significant international
assemblies of all time. Delegates from nations
throughout the world pledged to the destruc
tion of Fascism met to take the initial step in
shading the world of tomorrow. What is to be
accomplished? What do we Americans want
as a result of this conference? These are gues
tionr; we may well consider while it is still in
its early stages.
We believe that we want a plan of campaign.
There is among American thinkers everywhere
a restless search for an ideal or a plan which
will lead the world toward international co-op
eration in attacking the problems of supply and
distribution and control of lands; problems
which transcend national boundaries and na
tional creeds. We want something for which
we can fight. Without this the United Nations
is a fiction, a mere meaningless term.
An era of reconstruction is dawning in Eu
rope, and we regret bitterly that as yet Western
democracy has lighted no beacons to guide it.
Nationalism will spring up as strong as ever.
Communism will be even stronger, with the
spectacle of Russian success, and the gift for
organization and discipline which seem to be
long to it, because it is part of the underground
movement. These two forces will inevitably
combine, and some believe they represent the
most fruitful union possible at this time.
To us both of them represent a collective ideal
centered around a race, a nation, a class, or a
party; and impose so tight a discipline on the
individual that they may easily be turned to
vicious ends, and check the freedom of thought
and speech and action which serve as a con
trol and as the spear of progress, and provide
a rich and satisfying life for t'he individual.
These are ideals diametrically opposed to those
of Western democracy.
We can see such a period of confusion and
turmoil in Europe as nations attempt to rebuild
themselves, and as revolution may seem the
only means of bringing about changes fast
enough to meet demands, that new and yet
more ugly dictatorships are almost certain to
impose new forms of mass control.
That is why we must have, now, a restate
ment of democracy in terms, first, of a recogni
tion that complete nationalism of ownership,
control, and political organization are no longer
consonant with the maintenance of peace; and
second, a restoration of the human being as the
test and touchstone of policies, organiations and
laws rather than the vague abstraction "soci
ety," or its ramifications, "race," "nation," or
"class."
Ihe development of the individual human
personality as a responsible and creative unit
on an eguality with all other human beings has
been the outstanding contribution of European
and American civilization to thought and action.
11 has supplied the motive power for their prog
ress.
As yet we have had no such restatement of
democracy. The Atlantic charter was too vague,
Dumbarton Oaks too much like the agenda of a
small business concern, Yalta was a continua
tion of the war into the peace.
San Francisco represents our greatest and
perhaps our last opportunity. We sincerely be
lieve that democracy's apparent bankruptcy at
f his time is not an indication that it is a product
suited only to Anglo-Saxon and American so
cieties.
We believe that it presents the foundation
for individual progress and happiness in any
"race," "nation," or "society." But if democ
racy is to have a rebirth in the post-war world,
v/e, as the standard bearers, must choose the
way now. It may be generations before we
are given another chance.

democracy has lighted no beacons to guide it.
Nationalism will spring up as strong as ever.
Communism will be even stronger, with the
spectacle of Russian success, and the gift for
organization and discipline which seem to be
long to it, because it is part of the underground
movement. These two forces will inevitably
combine, and some believe they represent the
most fruitful union possible at this time.
To us both of them represent a collective ideal
centered around a race, a nation, a class, or a
party; and impose so tight a discipline on the
individual that they may easily be turned to
vicious ends, and check the freedom of thought
and speech and action which serve as a con
trol and as the spear of progress, and provide
a rich and satisfying life for t'he individual.
These are ideals diametrically opposed to those
of Western democracy.
We can see such a period of confusion and
turmoil in Europe as nations attempt to rebuild
themselves, and as revolution may seem the
only means of bringing about changes fast
enough to meet demands, that new and yet
more ugly dictatorships are almost certain to
impose new forms of mass control.
That is why we must have, now, a restate
ment of democracy in terms, first, of a recogni
tion that complete nationalism of ownership,
control, and political organization are no longer
consonant with the maintenance of peace; and
second, a restoration of the human being as the
test and touchstone of policies, organiations and
laws rather than the vague abstraction "soci
ety," or its ramifications, "race," "nation," or
"class."
Ihe development of the individual human
personality as a responsible and creative unit
on an eguality with all other human beings has
been the outstanding contribution of European
and American civilization to thought and action.

ress.
As yet we have had no such restatement of
democracy. The Atlantic charter was too vague,
Dumbarton Oaks too much like the agenda of a
small business concern, Yalta was a continua
tion of the war into the peace.
San Francisco represents our greatest and
perhaps our last opportunity. We sincerely be
lieve that democracy's apparent bankruptcy at
f his time is not an indication that it is a product
suited only to Anglo-Saxon and American so
cieties.
We believe that it presents the foundation
for individual progress and happiness in any
"race," "nation," or "society." But if democ
racy is to have a rebirth in the post-war world,
v/e, as the standard bearers, must choose the
way now. It may be generations before we
are given another chance.

Today in San Francisco was begun what may
well be one of the most significant international
assemblies of all time. Delegates from nations
throughout the world pledged to the destruc
tion of Fascism met to take the initial step in
shading the world of tomorrow. What is to be
accomplished? What do we Americans want
as a result of this conference? These are gues
tionr; we may well consider while it is still in
its early stages.
We believe that we want a plan of campaign.
There is among American thinkers everywhere
a restless search for an ideal or a plan which
will lead the world toward international co-op
eration in attacking the problems of supply and
distribution and control of lands; problems
which transcend national boundaries and na
tional creeds. We want something for which
we can fight. Without this the United Nations
is a fiction, a mere meaningless term.
An era of reconstruction is dawning in Eu
rope, and we regret bitterly that as yet Western
democracy has lighted no beacons to guide it.
