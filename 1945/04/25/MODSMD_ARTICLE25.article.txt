TODAY IS THE BEGINNING

Today the United Nations Conference which
will determine the course of history for many
decades begins. Diplomats from nearly every
nation in the world airive here to speak for
their peoples and the people of the world.
Now is work begun in an attempt to terminate
an era of discord and human agony; and man's
spirit, after a great trial, is rekindled by the new
vision of a brotherhood.
Many complex international problems still
remain to be solved but the will to solve them
makes them smaller.
Everywhere directly or indirectly the un
wholesmome effects of Fascism have disturbed
the order of world society. Millions of innocent
people have been slaughtered to suit the pur
poses of fanatical dictators. In Germany, it is
said, 5,000,000 Jews alone have been put to
death by the most ghastly means of torture be
cause they were a race out of favor.
Millions have been blasted to death by bombs
from those impartial instruments of war, air
planes. Millions in the armed forces of nations
have been cruelly wounded or slain in defense
of their lands. Fascists have eradicated price
less works of art. They have outlawed or made
inconsequential culture and morality.
Civilization totters but survives, still strong
in the faith that the crisis of Fascism never again
will occur. At San Francisco Fascism will be
buried, we trust, remaining only in history as
a monument to the evil possibilities of the
human mind.
Outmoded political systems and old injus
tices may perish at San Francisco. Pressure will
come upon the British Empire to give her sub
ject peoples economic and political freedom.
We are wisely giving political independence to
the Philippines, and there will seem less rea
son for other Oriental peoples not to have simi
lar justice.
Now or never must come the realization that
there exists no inferior people and that every
human being has a right to a free and complete
life, no matter what his culture, faith, or skin.
America in particular, which stands for so
much, should be aware of this fact. In our
history negroes and other colored peoples have
been treated as inferior to the white man, when
they are equal.
