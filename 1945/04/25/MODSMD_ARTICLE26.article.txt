### PEGGY FITTS 
Did you ever stop to think how many different kinds
of cai'ds they must have over in the Ad Buildingâ€”the
home of the outstretched hand. (You're halfway to
heaven and suddenly, there's the Cashier's Office!)
You've seen them around, in the Reg Books, in your
P.O. box, in the wastebaskets of the worst people;
green cards, pink cards, puce cards, and deuces wild,
each with the requisite number of blank spaces. (Sign
on the dotted line and live a little longer.)
But there's one card you have to wait four years,
more or less, to put a pen to, the card from the anti
climax department, the pay-off card. There's a
little stack of them sitting in front of the Informa
tion Window right now (knock twice and ask for
Joe.) It's a little card in a mournful shade of blue,
and in the right-hand corner, which they keep for
the good word, it says in very small print "Candidate
for Graduation." That's me. (Paid adv.)
There are people who go right into a swivet at the
sight of a blank space. They just can't buckle down
to the yawn-ma king realities, and they don't waste
a lot of time trying. In four years at Stanford U. these
people have all kinds of a time. Where it says "Mr.,
Mrs., or Miss," they like to put "All three"; they
claim to be "completing requirements in the school of"
Embalming (or Tapestry-Weaving); and if everything
else fails, as it so often does, they'll fill in the rest of
the card with "Are you kidding?"
But this card is different. This is the card you
don't kid around with. It's a sticky moment, brothers
and sisters, when you pick up the little blue card and
find out you've gone the way of all freshmen and
somehow or other become a "Candidate for Gradu
ation." Maybe the thought sneaks up on you that a
little blue card isn't much to show for four years. And
maybe you wish it was four years ago, when you had
nothing to worry about except getting in, and all your
friends were young and green instead of old and mud
colored.
Myself, I'm going to open an office, not too far
from the Cellar, and on the door it's going to say
"Perpetual Candidate No. 1. Positively no graduates
allowed."
The class of '45 is invited.
