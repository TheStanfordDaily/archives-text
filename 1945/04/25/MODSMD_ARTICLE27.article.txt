The week-end before last it became evident that
the freshman women were either disinterested or mis
informed concrning the open houses held.by the var
ious women's living groups for the freshman women's
benefit. The small number attending made the pro
gram seem worthless.
Last week-end this complete indifference was
proven when tea invitations were accepted to various
houses and ignored—for example in one living group
fifty women accepted and two attended; this was
not only rude on the part of those accepting but a
complete waste of time, effort, and food for the
living group.
The present situation is defeating the purposes of
the whole program and only serving to create a gap
between the freshmen and the girls with whom they
must live next year.
We are a house which has not yet entertained but
are scheduled to next week-end. It is our suggestion
that unless a more organized and enthusiastic response
is shown to the piogram it should be discontinued.
It seems, however, a shame to deprive those who
did and who wish to take this opportunity to get
acquainted with other living groups, but it is not
worth while for such a small number.
