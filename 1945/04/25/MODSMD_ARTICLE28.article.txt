Beyond All Fronts: A Bystand
er's Notes on this Thirty Years
War. By Max Jordan (The Bruce
Publishing Co., Milwaukee). 38(1
pp. $3.00.
The Daily Reviewer is co-operat
ing with the Stanford Bookstore in
emphasizing books that may he use
ful reading for those interested in the
San Francisco Conference. In the
Bookstore windows this week a new
display shows a selection of such
books; a few of them will be re
viewed in these columns.
The attitude of the Allied peoples
toward Germany will largely hinge
on the answer to what at one time
might have seemed a purely philoso
phical question, namely, what kind of
people are the Germans? Are they
all hopelessly imbued with the rest
less urge for conquest, for disquiet,
for revolt against Western Civiliza
tion? Can we expect nothing more
from them than the recurrence of
the furor Teutonicus lhat has dis
turbed Europe for a thousand years?
Max Jordan in this book has a de
cided "No" to these questions. He
recounts once more the familiar
story of European politics since 1920;
his personal experiences in European
countries serve as a connecting link
throughout the period. He loses no
opportunity, reasonable or otherwise,
while relating the story, to point out
occasions when the bulk of the Ger
man people showed themselves un
sympathetic to the Nazi regime.
The argument here seems at times
a trace too finely drawn, as for ex
ample when art exhibtion of "degen
erate art" (Hitler definition) draws
twice as much interest as a "model
show" set up on Hitler's standards,
Mr. Jordan sees this as a significant
expression on the part of "the two
thirds of the German people who
had opposed Hitler ever since he had
come to power, (and who) had ap
parently not changed their minds."
The author has sometimes over
reached himself in his anxiety to
promote his thesis. Yet some em
phasis of his view-point is necessary
at this time when too many adopt
the glib theory of Vanstittart and
regard the whole German nation as
little short of psychopathic criminals.
The history of the brave German
underground is given in this volume.
Carl Goerdelei emerges as the hero
of that movement, yet even Goerde
ler appears to have been the agent
of the military faction and as such
will be regarded with reserve by the
Allies. The German underground
movement was never as fully organ
ized as similar movements jiow in
other countries, or, as we have rea
son to fear, the Nazi undergi-ound
now in Germany. Again the impar
tial observer cannot but feel that to
say two-thirds of the German nation
remained opposed to Hitler is a false
statement of the Tacts.
In his consideration of the plans
for peace, Mr. Jordan rightly states
that the Allies must take advantage
of the strong feeling for peace that
will prevail in Germany after the
war, and use it to inculcate demo
cratic ideals. The contempt that the
Germans have been taught to feel
for America must first be dispelled,
or the Germans will be in no mood
to learn anything from us. This is

the hardest task that the would-be
educators of Germany will have to
attempt.
There is a sound basis for hope,
nevertheless. The Allied nations
must regard themselves as doctors to
a sick Germany; like all doctors the
best they can do is to interfere as
little as possible and let Nature do
ihc healing. The Zeitgeist, as Mat
thew Arnold called it, is in their
favor. An industrial nation, divorced
of military aims, will produce a pop
ulation well drilled in the immutable
laws of cause and effect, skeptical of
the existence of "Heaven-sent des
tinies," imbued with the attitudes of
modern science and hence unlikely
to accept mystical doctrines of
"blood" and "race." If such a nation
is allowed to emerge from the ruins
of Germany the Allies may congrat
ulate themselves on having won the
peace not only for themselves but for
their unfortunate foes.—Sydney Ross

of military aims, will produce a pop

The Daily Reviewer is co-operat
ing with the Stanford Bookstore in

ful reading for those interested in the
San Francisco Conference. In the
Bookstore windows this week a new
display shows a selection of such
books; a few of them will be re
viewed in these columns.
The attitude of the Allied peoples
toward Germany will largely hinge
on the answer to what at one time
might have seemed a purely philoso
phical question, namely, what kind of
people are the Germans? Are they
all hopelessly imbued with the rest
less urge for conquest, for disquiet,
for revolt against Western Civiliza
tion? Can we expect nothing more
from them than the recurrence of
the furor Teutonicus lhat has dis
turbed Europe for a thousand years?
Max Jordan in this book has a de
cided "No" to these questions. He
recounts once more the familiar
story of European politics since 1920;
his personal experiences in European
countries serve as a connecting link
throughout the period. He loses no
opportunity, reasonable or otherwise,
while relating the story, to point out
occasions when the bulk of the Ger
man people showed themselves un
sympathetic to the Nazi regime.
The argument here seems at times
a trace too finely drawn, as for ex
ample when art exhibtion of "degen
erate art" (Hitler definition) draws
twice as much interest as a "model
show" set up on Hitler's standards,
Mr. Jordan sees this as a significant
expression on the part of "the two
thirds of the German people who
had opposed Hitler ever since he had
come to power, (and who) had ap
parently not changed their minds."
The author has sometimes over
reached himself in his anxiety to
promote his thesis. Yet some em
phasis of his view-point is necessary
at this time when too many adopt
the glib theory of Vanstittart and
regard the whole German nation as
little short of psychopathic criminals.
The history of the brave German
underground is given in this volume.
Carl Goerdelei emerges as the hero
of that movement, yet even Goerde
ler appears to have been the agent
of the military faction and as such
will be regarded with reserve by the
Allies. The German underground
movement was never as fully organ
ized as similar movements jiow in
other countries, or, as we have rea
son to fear, the Nazi undergi-ound
now in Germany. Again the impar
tial observer cannot but feel that to
say two-thirds of the German nation
remained opposed to Hitler is a false
statement of the Tacts.
In his consideration of the plans
for peace, Mr. Jordan rightly states
that the Allies must take advantage
of the strong feeling for peace that
will prevail in Germany after the
war, and use it to inculcate demo
cratic ideals. The contempt that the
Germans have been taught to feel
for America must first be dispelled,
or the Germans will be in no mood
to learn anything from us. This is

the hardest task that the would-be
educators of Germany will have to
attempt.
There is a sound basis for hope,
nevertheless. The Allied nations
must regard themselves as doctors to
a sick Germany; like all doctors the
best they can do is to interfere as
little as possible and let Nature do
