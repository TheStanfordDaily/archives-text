For our first column of the quar
ter we've picked Louis Armstrong
as the musician of the week. Louis
was born on July 4, 1900. Thirteen
years later Louis was sent to a waif's
home where he learned to piay the
cornet. When he left home, he start
ed to play with small bands in the
honky-tonks of New Orleans. Louis
joined the King Oliver band in 1922,
which marked the beginning of his
march to fame. During this period
Louis married Lil Hardin, who was
the pianist with the Oliver band.
They later formed a band of their
own, which was first known as "Lil's
Hot Shots" and later as "Louis Arm
strong's Hot Five."
In 1932 Louis went to Europe
where he remained until 1935. When
he came back to the United States,
he started leading Luis Russell's old
band. Since that time none of Louis'
bands have been too good; sometimes
very bad. But always Louis was
playing wonderful cornet. During
that period he made many records
for Decca, most of them extremely
good.
Louis isn't playing the same type
of New Orleans music he played 20
years ago. He feels that music and
jazz have advanced since those days
and thinks that he should keep up
vvith vhe vimes.
Most of the records made by Louis
Armstrong are collectors' items to
day. There are available only a few
albums and single records.
Among the best of them are the
Columbia albums "King Louis,"
"Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five,'
and "Louis and Earl," Decca's "Louis
Armstrong Classics" and the new
Victor album which was just issued
under their green label educational
series.

very humorous song sung by Ger
trude Neisen, from the musical com
edy, "Follow the Girls" (Decca).
Popular: "Strange Music" by Fred
dy Martin (Victor).

by Cesar Franck, beautifully per
