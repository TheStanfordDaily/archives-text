"It is obvious that the Indian dele
gates to the United Nations Confer
ence don't represent the Indian peo
ple," said E. Wesley Mumby in a
talk on India to the Wesley Foun
dation Sunday afternoon.
Mr. Mumby, who was on the fac
ulty of the Lucknow Christian Col
lege in India from 1921 to 1942, ex
plained that the three delegates to
the Conference were appointed by
the Viceroy of India and will present
only the British point of view of
Indian problems.
In presenting a background for
current Indian problems, the
speaker recalled that in 1936 the
nominees of the Indian National
Party were elected to the All-In
dia Congress in eight of the 11
provinces of India. This legislative
body directed almost completely
the internal affairs of India for the
following two and a half years
although (he British appointed
provincial governors still retained
the power of veto, he said.
Mr. Mumby outlined the achieve
ments of the Congress under three
main points: (1) An investigation of
past treatment of India by Great Bri
tain and the dissemination of this
information throughout the country;
(2) A concerted movement to regain
land for the oppressed classes which
had been slowly taken over by pow
erful landlords; (3) A program of
adult literacy which has taught two
and one-half times as many people
to read and write as had been edu
cated during the long period of Brit
ish control before 1936.

At present there is strong re
sentment against England in India
because the British Parliament de
clared war on Germany and Japan
on behalf of India without consult
in the All-India Congress, said Mr.
Mumby. The Viceroy of India had
to use his special powers to over
rule a decision of the Indian Su
preme Court which declared illegal
the imprsonnient of 25,(100 leaders
of the Indian National Party, added
the speaker. These imprisoned
leaders arc the heroes of the peo
ple of India and they alone could
truly speak for the Indian people,
he continued.
Mr. Mumby then talked a bit
about the efforts of British agencies ,
to keep America uninformed or mis
informed about what is really going '
on in India. He pointed out that any
sort of disturbance, even minor
brawls between student bodies of op
posing schools following an athletic
contest, is heralded in the British
press as a riot between the Hindus
and Mohammedans in an effort to
convince us that freedom for India j
would mean civil war within the
country. The fact is, stated Mr.
Mumby, that for that period of two
and one-half years in which the All -
India Congress was operating, the
various factions in India co-operated
with each other to a remarkable de
gree, with both Hindus and Mo
hammedans participating in the gov-

eminent.
To demonstrate the efforts of
Great Britain to prevent the
American people finding out about

the actual conditions in India Mr

!Miunl>y disclosed (hut the British
information service on India have
quadrupled their expenditures
since the arrival in this country of
Mrs. Vijayalakshmi Pandit, sister
of Jawaharlal Nehru, who will
prohahly take over the leadership
of the Indian National Party when
Ghandi dies.
Mr. Mumby is now an instructor
of physical eduaction at Stanford and
is active in local YMCA affairs. For

the past few weeks Mr. Mumby hasÂ®
been speaking on India to high
schools and other groups in North
ern California.
