# Boozers Win by 14-0; Phi Psis Upset, 6-3
## 
### BOB GILKEY 
Monroe's league-leading Softball
team further entrenched its firm
hold on first place yesterday by
plastering Buchanan, 14-0, but the
Med School, a late entry, estab
lished itself as a powerful contender
by upsetting Phi Psi, 6-3.
The Monroe victory gave the
Boozers four wins and no defeats,
while Buchanan was dropped from
the undefeated ranks as a result of
the loss. Monroe opened with six
runs in the first and added two in
the second and six more in the
seventh. Joe Sher turned in a mas

terful performance on the slab for
Monroe to coast to an easy triumph.
The Med School, winning its sec
ond straight game since entering the
league, pulled the big upset of the
day in defeating powerful Phi Psi.
The Phi Psi's were handicapped by
the loss of ace pitcher Luke Pitts,
who was suffering from a sore back,
and while Bob Stephens, his substi
tute. turned in a creditable perform
ance, the loss of Pitts was keenly
felt.
The contest was scoreless until
the fourth, when Med School pushed
across two runs. Phi Psi came back
with three in the first of the fifth,
but the Med School went on to win
with one in the fifth, two in the
sixth, and one in the seventh.
Arguello came through with a
minor upset by trouncing Tyler, 14-
9. The victors pounded out the
mammoth total of 12 runs in the first
two innings, a homer by Ted Morri
son being the big blow. Tyler slow
ly closed the gap but was never able
to overtake the Arguellans, who
brought their seasonal average to
. 500. The Hilltoppers, a big dis
appointment to date, blew their
third straight game.
The Legal Eagles copped their
third win in four starts by downing
a hustling Flac ten, 11-8, in a wild
and woolly battle. The Eagles scored
twice in the first and once in the
second, but the winless Flacs came
back with one in the second and a
four-run barrage in the third to
move ahead.
With the Flacs enjoying a 6-3 lead
and seemingly headed for an upset
win, the roof caved in the sixth.
Infield errors led to seven Eagle
runs and gave the winners a com
fortable lead which they never re
linquished.
The Flacs have shown plenty of
fight and hustle, and while they
have yet to win a game, they should
provide plenty of trouble for their
remaining opponents. Ernie Webb,
speedy little catcher-pitcher, is one
of the best stolen base artists in the
circuit, and the hitting department,
paced by Webb and Bob Gettys, is
improving with every game.

The Legal Eagles copped their
third win in four starts by downing
a hustling Flac ten, 11-8, in a wild
and woolly battle. The Eagles scored
twice in the first and once in the
second, but the winless Flacs came
back with one in the second and a
four-run barrage in the third to
move ahead.
With the Flacs enjoying a 6-3 lead
and seemingly headed for an upset
win, the roof caved in the sixth.
Infield errors led to seven Eagle
runs and gave the winners a com
fortable lead which they never re
linquished.
The Flacs have shown plenty of
fight and hustle, and while they
have yet to win a game, they should
provide plenty of trouble for their
remaining opponents. Ernie Webb,
speedy little catcher-pitcher, is one
of the best stolen base artists in the
circuit, and the hitting department,
paced by Webb and Bob Gettys, is
improving with every game.
Monroe's league-leading Softball
team further entrenched its firm
hold on first place yesterday by
plastering Buchanan, 14-0, but the
Med School, a late entry, estab
lished itself as a powerful contender
by upsetting Phi Psi, 6-3.
The Monroe victory gave the
Boozers four wins and no defeats,
while Buchanan was dropped from
the undefeated ranks as a result of
the loss. Monroe opened with six
runs in the first and added two in
the second and six more in the
seventh. Joe Sher turned in a mas

terful performance on the slab for
Monroe to coast to an easy triumph.
The Med School, winning its sec
ond straight game since entering the
league, pulled the big upset of the
day in defeating powerful Phi Psi.
The Phi Psi's were handicapped by
the loss of ace pitcher Luke Pitts,
who was suffering from a sore back,
and while Bob Stephens, his substi
tute. turned in a creditable perform
ance, the loss of Pitts was keenly
felt.
The contest was scoreless until
the fourth, when Med School pushed
across two runs. Phi Psi came back
with three in the first of the fifth,
but the Med School went on to win
with one in the fifth, two in the
sixth, and one in the seventh.
Arguello came through with a
minor upset by trouncing Tyler, 14-
9. The victors pounded out the
mammoth total of 12 runs in the first
two innings, a homer by Ted Morri
son being the big blow. Tyler slow
ly closed the gap but was never able
to overtake the Arguellans, who
brought their seasonal average to
. 500. The Hilltoppers, a big dis
appointment to date, blew their
third straight game.
