### BOB SLOBE 
Thanks to the efforts of Bob Ros
burg, another independent team has
been formed similar to the basket
ball squad captained by Dave Brown
last quarter. Games are being sought
with a number of high schools, serv
ice teams, and junior colleges.
Talent is definitely not lacking.
\ In a recent intra-squad contest,
some excellent pitching and field
ing ability was demonstrated. Ros
lnirg held the opposition in check
with no hits, and only two men
reached base in three innings.
Pitchers Galore
A good pitcher can either make
or break a team, and the "Independ
ents" seem to have a,n abundance of
them. Leading hurler will probably
be "Doc" Mason who pitched for
Stanford in the last year of inter
collegiate competition. Mason has
terrific fastball and a baffling hook
that will cause plenty of headaches
for the opposition. Rosburg also has
plenty of "stuff" on the ball. Joe
Sher, who can really burn that soft
ball in, has great potentialities as a
hardball chucker.
The infield also consists of a well
talented crew, with Tom Hood on
first base, Ted Morrison on second,
Tom Ashley at shortstop, and the
versatile Rosburg covering the "hot
corner." Outfielding chores will be
held down by Luke Pitts, Dennis
Fox, Ray Ryan, and others yet un
named.
"We will sometimes play two
games a week," stated Rosburg,
and then added, "we might even
have some Sunday games played
in the near vicinity."
Though the schedule is as yet in
definite, the "Independents" hope to
have a ten to fifteen game season.
Support Them
Continuing its wartime policy to
ward intercollegiate athletics, the ad
ministration will not support, en
courage, or officially sanction the
squad, but it is hoped that Stanford
students will support this team as
their own, and get behind it 100 per
cent. This is a team of Stanford stu
dents who are going out on their
own time and expense to try to per
petuate the Stanford spirit until such
a time that an active athletic pro
gram can again be resumed. Let's
support them by showing that we
are for them all the way!

The infield also consists of a well
talented crew, with Tom Hood on
first base, Ted Morrison on second,
Tom Ashley at shortstop, and the
versatile Rosburg covering the "hot
corner." Outfielding chores will be
held down by Luke Pitts, Dennis
Fox, Ray Ryan, and others yet un
named.
"We will sometimes play two
games a week," stated Rosburg,
and then added, "we might even
have some Sunday games played
in the near vicinity."
Though the schedule is as yet in
definite, the "Independents" hope to
have a ten to fifteen game season.
Support Them
Continuing its wartime policy to
ward intercollegiate athletics, the ad
ministration will not support, en
courage, or officially sanction the
squad, but it is hoped that Stanford
students will support this team as
their own, and get behind it 100 per
cent. This is a team of Stanford stu
dents who are going out on their
own time and expense to try to per
petuate the Stanford spirit until such
a time that an active athletic pro
gram can again be resumed. Let's
support them by showing that we
are for them all the way!
