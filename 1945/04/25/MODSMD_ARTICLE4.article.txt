# Pattern's Tanks Near Austria
## 
### 
PARIS, Wednesday, April 25 (UP). â€”Lieut. Gen. George S. Patton's
racing tanks carved out a spectacular 28-mile gain today, driving within
35 miles of Austria and reaching the Danube, four miles west of Regens
burg. Other American and French forces assaulting the Nazis' southern
redoubt captured Ulm and threatened Augsburg and Munich.
Patton's sensational break-through, which has covered 78 miles in two
days, was rolling to the Germans' Danube River defenses at a two-mile
an-hour gait as his tanks ripped to within 94 miles of Berchtesgaden, Adolf
Hitler's redoubt fastness, and 120 miles of the Russians west of Vienna.
Lieut. Gen. Alexander M. Patch's powerful Seventh Army on Patton's
western flank joined with the French First Army to capture Ulm on the
Danube where that river becomes navigable for traffic to the Black Sea.
