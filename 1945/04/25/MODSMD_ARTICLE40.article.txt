# Arranging of Time Schedules Confusing Job, Says Winbigler
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
The difficulty of arranging the cal
endar for each quarter and schedul
ing all classes is one of the main
problems settled in the Ad Building,
according to Donald B. Winbigler,
associate registrar in charge of this
job.
"We have different units operating
on different schedules and we have
to avoid conflicts over room assign
ments and overlapping quarters," he
said.
"Cycle One"
Last year the ASTP and civilians
were on the same quarter system
called "Cycle One" by the Army.
Quarters began on approximately the
tenth of October, January, April, and
Jul/, and ended on the 30th of the
month three months later. Every
quarter started on a Monday and
ended on a Saturday.
In that system, fall quarter ran
into Christmas vacation. Now the
ASTP is reduced and the civilian
quarter is gradually returning to
normal. At the beginning of sum
mer quarter it will be normal.
Spring Classes
This quarter, civilian classes be
gan Tuesday, April 3, and will end
June 13. ASTRP classes began April
Sand will end June 30, after the be
ginning of the civilian summer quar
ter, June 21.
The ASTAP, advanced engineers,
are on still another quarter system
called Cycle Three. They began
March 12 and will close June 2.
Their summer quarter will start
June 11, while the civilian spring
quarter is still going.
Class One Gone
"Class One of the CATS has come
and gone," he said. Class Two is on
a six months quarter—Jan. 22 to
June 30. Class Three began April 9
and will end Oct. 6.
Medical School classes in which
Army men are enrolled are in Cy
cle One—they began April 9 and
will close June 20.
Civilian students who are taking
ASTRP classes will begin their sum
mer quarter civilian courses before

their spring quarter Army classes are
over.
Schedules Confusing
"Having so many different sched
ules makes our job very confusing,"
Mr. Winbigler said. "We are in
charge of assigning rooms for all
classes and we have to see that they
don't conflict."
During every quarter Miss Miriam
Remele sends out blanks to all the
departments, so they can fill out the
classes they will teach, what time
they will teach them, and what room
they prefer. If the room number
space is left blank, the Registrar's of
fice assigns a room, or if there are
any conflicts in rooms, this office
straightens ihem out.
"We have to be careful not to as
sign any summer quarter classes in
rooms where spring quarter classes
may still be meeting," he said.
Special Room Code
The Registrar's office keeps a rec
ord of all the classrooms and what
classes are meeting in them. It does
this by a carefully worked out code.
In this way it can tell at a glance
whether a room is free or not.
At the present time, one of the
main problems is finals. The office
has to be careful not to schedule any
civilian finals where any of the
Army's regular classes will be meet
ing. It either has to move the ex
amination or the class.
Time Schedules Underway
Miss Remele is working on both
summer and fall quarter time sched

ules, so that lower division students
can pre-reg for cither quarter, de
pending upon whether they are com
ing quarter or not. The summer
schedule will come out May 28 and
29, and the fall schedule, June 4 and
5.
Mr. Winbigler also plans the pro
grams for all the ASTRP men —
where they will have their classes
and when. One time he had to ar
range 30 different sections in one
term. "This was a gigantic mathe
matical puzzle," he said.
