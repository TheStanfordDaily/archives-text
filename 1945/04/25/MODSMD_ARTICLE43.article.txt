# Five Summer Workshops Accent Teaching Problems
## 
### 
Accent on actual teaching problems will be the keynote of the education
workshops offered this summer at Stanford from June 21 to August 17,
according to Dr. Lucien B. Kinney, acting dean of the School of Education.
While world peace leaders develop broad plans for inter-racial harmony,
the Stanford Workshop on Intercultural Relations will search for practical

answers to real problems in the com
munity. This workshop method has
been found the most effective way
of meeting the needs of educators
who come for just one summer's con
centrated study, claims Dr. Kinney.

according to Dr. Lucien B. Kinney, acting dean of the School of Education.
While world peace leaders develop broad plans for inter-racial harmony,
the Stanford Workshop on Intercultural Relations will search for practical

answers to real problems in the com
munity. This workshop method has
been found the most effective way
of meeting the needs of educators
who come for just one summer's con
centrated study, claims Dr. Kinney.
Trips to Supplement
Field trips will supplement group
discussion. Heading the workshop
will be Dr. Stewart G. Cole, director
of the West Coast Office of the Bu
reau for Intercultural Education, and
Dr. I. James Quillen, associate pro
fessor of education.
# This summer there will be five
workshops, four of them in educa
tion. Besides the one in Intercultural
Relations, there is the Workshop for
Elerrtentary Teachers with Emer
gency Credentials, the Workshop in
Guidance, Workshop in Foreign
Language Teaching, and the Insti
tute and Workshop on Intcr-Amcri
can Relations.
Will Help War Teachers
Over 7,000 teachers in California
have only emergency teaching cre
dentials. The Stanford workshop
will be set up to help these wartime
teachers obtain regular credentials.
Special seminars will be set up to
fit specific needs. Professors Paul R.
Hanna and J. Paul Leonard will be
co-directors of the workshop.
The Guidance Workshop will han
dle such problems as planning of
counseling programs, advising re
turning veterans, and dealing with
delinquent or problem children. Di
rector of the workshop will be Pro
fessor Leonard.
Latin-American Workshop
The Workshop in Modernized
Foreign-Language Teaching will be
conducted by Professor Walter V.
Kaulfers as part of the Latin-Amer
ican Workshop. Dr. Kaulfers worked
in the Army program and in this
course will adapt the best teaching
methods of Army language programs
in Spanish, French, German, and
Italian to typical school situations.
This workshop is only presented the
first four weeks.
Courses in all workshops will be
so arranged that those unable to
come for the full program will be
able to take the four-week courses.
