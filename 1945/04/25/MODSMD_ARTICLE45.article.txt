physics branch of the aero-medical

Gretchen Ahlswede, class of '39,
American Red Cross clubmobile di
rector in Southern France, thought
she had every type of work there
was to do in the process of distribut
ing doughnuts to battle-worn G.l.'s
until she landed in France immedi
ately after D-day. Airfields were
being established in the forward lines
and gasoline for the clubmobiles was
unavailable, so the group's com
manding general requested a differ
ent type of operation that had never
been attempted before.
The doughnut machine was kept
far behind the fighting, each girl in
the unit set up a small club closer
to the front, and Miss Ahlswede kept
the doughnut maker informed of the
needs of the various forward fields.
The precious dunkers and supplies
for coffee canteens, and in addition,
entertainment, were ferried in by
courier planes. In cases when weath
er prevented the arrival of the
planes, improvised snacks could be
served.
