# Venezuelan Aid Helping War Says Machado
## 
### ROD BROWNING 
Dr. Alfredo Machado, the father
of two Stanford students, Guillermo
and Alfredo Machado, is a delegate
to the San Francisco Conference
from Venezuela. Guillermo and his
brother Alfredo went to school in
Venezuela. While Guillermo Ma
chado was in school there he took
some courses in English and later
on spent some time in England.
This gave him the chance to learn
that great puzzle, the English lan
guage. He is taking some courses in
engineering and business adminis
tration here at Stanford, although
he already has a degree in engi
neering from Venezuela. He and his
brother came to this country only
five months ago and intend to re
turn to Venezuela in a few years.
"Venezuela is a country whose
importance has grown greatly
because of the war," Scnor Ma
chado said. Oil is the main prod
uct of Venezuela and the large
exports of oil lo the Allies are
helping in a large part to will the
war.
The oil companies in Venezuela
are mostly American and foreign
concerns. These companies bring a
great many engineering specialists
to Venezuela, especially from the
United States.
The Venezuelan government
and people are quite content to
let foreign countries exploit the
oil resources of the country. Ve
nezuela itself does not have the
trained specialists to Ho the job.
Also, the taxes paid to the Vene
zuelan government by these com
panies constitute the main incomc
of the government.
The population of Venezuela is
centered mostly in the northern part
of the country. Since the equator
runs right through the country, the
main part is covered with tropical
jungles.
Venezuela is a member of the
League of Nations and within the
last few years the government has
been very much in accord with
the Latin-American policy of the
United States. Since most of the
export and import business of
Venezuela is done with the United
States, the people of Venezuela
arc greatly interested in this
country and the San Francisco
Conference.
Dr. Alfredo Machado arrived here
Sunday with three other delegates
from Venezuela to attend the San
