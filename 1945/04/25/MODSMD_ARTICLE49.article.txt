# Light Goes Crooked In Physics Exhibit
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
Did you know that light doesn't always travel in straight lines? Well,
it's true and you can see it for yourself at the present demonstration ex
hibit in the Physics Department. The display case is on the east wall of the
corridor running through the Physics Building near the back door.
On the front window of the case are several pieces of film with very

â€¢narrow slits on them. When the light
passes through these small openings
it bends in a way that makes the
light filament in the back of the case
appear wider than normal. This
bending is similar to the bending of
sound waves around comers, only
on a much smaller scale. You can
also see that red light has a longer
wave length than blue, because it. is
bent more when passing through the
slits.
Wave Motion
Another part of the present exhibit
is designed to show that light actu
ally possesses wave motion, a fact
which has been known for only
about 100 years. The "diffraction
gratings" used to show this are also
used by scientists to perform analy
ses of chemical substances.
This physics project was originated
about three years ago by Professor
Paul Kirkpatrick, who is now acting
head of the School of Physical Sci
ences. It is designed to provide both
entertainment and education for
passers-by, as well as the members
of the Physics Department who take
turns designing and setting up the
displays.
Past Exhibits
Some of the exhibitions which
have appeared in past years include
a demonstration of three-color stere
oscopic photography and a special
gyroscope which rotated at the rate
of 500 times a second. Demonstra
tions have also been shown of polar
ized light effects, motors which run
on heat or by means of hidden mag
nets, and an apparatus which shows
a "picture" of sound waves.
The next exhibit, to be set up as
soon as the overworked physics stafT
has time enough, will send KPO's
broadcast on a beam of light up and
down the hall, with a chance for the
observer to have some fun by inter
rupting the beam in different ways.
If this sounds interesting, be sure to
get in the habit of taking a short cut
through the Physics Building when
you are around that way to see
what's going on.
