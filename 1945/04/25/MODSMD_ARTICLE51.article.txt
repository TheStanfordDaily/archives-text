### 
Stanford Philological Association
will hear Nathan Van Patten, direc
tor of University Libraries, speak
Thursday afternoon on "Would a
Linguistic Museum Serve a Useful
Purpose in a University Library?"
The discussion will begin at 4:15
p.m. in the lower lounge of the Fac
ulty Women's Clubhouse.
It will cover the possible organi
zation of such a museum, the nature
of its exhibits, the publication of
descriptive handlists, and the collec
tion of material. Such a museum
might include exhibits dealing with
anatomical and physiological charac
teristics of the vocal mechanism, his
torical materials relating to the
graphic arts, the development of

shorthand systems, the geographic
distribution of languages, the devel
opment of alphabets, hearing aids,
early linguistic publications.
Dr. Van Patten is interested in
determining how much interest ex
ists in such a project.
Faculty, students, and the general
public is invited.
