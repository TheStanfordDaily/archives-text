### 
Presenting a somewhat rosy pic
ture of life in the Philippines before
the war, "Pledge to Bataan," docu
mentary film on the Tuesday Eve
ning Series last night, nevertheless
showed clearly what has been ac
complished and what is possible for
the post-war economic and social de
velopment of the islands.
This technicolor film, with musi
cal accompaniment, directed by Ed
ward Craig, was produced by Her
bert T. Edwards, with commentary
by Ralph Schoolman and photogra
phy by David Griffin. Besides show
ing the modern industrial and agri
cultural progress of the Philippines,
it presented a picturesque record of
the folk customs of the islands.
Old native dances and music, per
formed at the harvests of such an
cient crops as rice, coconuts, and
sugar cane, were depicted, with
dancers in the colorful native cos
tumes.
American influence in the cultural,
social, and political progress was am
ply shown, coupled with the fact that
Filipinos today have the highest
standard of living of any people of
the Orient.
The Philippines' progress in indus
try and manufacturing has been
great, with most of their products
going toward the betterment of the
Filipino people themselves.
The main Philippine industrial
projects today arc mining and lum
ber. The picture showed the old na
tive styles of their agricultural proc
esses, contrasting them with the con-
I tributions which modern American
machinery has made to further this
! progress.—Shelton
