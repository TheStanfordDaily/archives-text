# San Francisco — Peace Conference Boom Town
## 
### JOAN HODGDON NADA SKIDMORE 
On the eve of the San Francisco Conference your two Daily
reporters toured the city, rubbing elbows yesterday with United
Nations diplomats, high-ranking military and naval aides, news
men and photographers, and the man in the street—who was a
little bewildered and goggle-eyed at the moment.
Daily representatives applied for credentials at press head
quarters located in the Veterans Building, center of teeming pre-
Conference activities and nucleus of a well-policed restricted
area where United Nations meetings begin today. Three police
men questioning all those entering the area were genial but firm,
impressing visitors that once the conference has begun the strict
est regulations will be enforced at all points of entrance to the
' area.
Inside the Veterans' Building photographers rushed by with
flashbulb equipment while a group of sailors wheeled a wagon
carrying 15 typewriters into news agency ofifces—the Chinese
Central News Agency, France Presse, INS, and others were rep
resented, with U.P. and A.P. of-ices facing each other at opposite
ends of the lobby.
Foreign delegates received silver label buttons identifying
them as official representatives, who were registering at three

long desks in the lobby. Now covered with signs for each of
the 46 United Nations, these desks will later be used to aid the
delegates with transportation and banking difficulties.
Smaller committee meetings of the Conference will be held
in the auditorium of the Veterans Building, a room approximately
the size of Stanford's Cubberley Auditorium. Yesterday carpen
ters, hurrying to ready the room for these meetings, were setting
up rows of desks facing a long, pale blue speakers' table.
Next door stands the massive War Memorial Opera House
where delegates from all over the world will convene today for
the first time. Daily reporters hoping to glimpse preparations
were refused admittance after dodging in a stage entrance where
a guard demanded special credentials.
San Francisco's hotel lobbies had an atmosphere of subdued
tenseness as delegates arrived in the city. Luggage was stacked
high near the middle of the Fairmont Hotel's flag-draped lobby—
luggage with European hotel stickers, "special pass" railroad
tags, and even a small bundle of Turkish cigarettes.
"We're looking for Czechoslovakian luggage," one of the
bellboys yelled.
"Put the Belgians' over here," replied another.
A European diplomat with a white goatee, pinstriped pants,

and a silver-topped cane searched for his suitcase. Heads turned
as two men in flowing Arabian robes and white and gold head
dresses entered the lobby and walked toward the elevators.
Photographers took flashbulb shots of the scene as a sudden
influx of delegates and members of their staffs filled the room.
Staying at the Fairmont are Nelson Rockefeller and staff, Czecho
slovakia, Jugoslavia, Belgium, Union of South Africa, Saudi Ara
bia, United States, and Norway.
One official aide typified the feelings of everyone in the lobby
by greeting an old acquaintance, who was wearing the familiar
badge, with:
"My God, everybody's here!"
As taxis with flag stickers designating various countries on
their side windows passed at the usual San Francisco speed, a
four-star Admiral strode across California Avenue.
Meanwhile in Union Square, heart of the city, nothing had
changed, except for the two flags at half-mast. A small man with
a beard parted down the middle fed the pigeons and quietly
watched an overgrown town assimilate the flow of foreign
tongues, red fezzes, unfamiliar uniforms, and good and bad di
plomacy. This was San Francisco the day before it stepped into
history.

A European diplomat with a white goatee, pinstriped pants,

and a silver-topped cane searched for his suitcase. Heads turned
as two men in flowing Arabian robes and white and gold head
dresses entered the lobby and walked toward the elevators.
Photographers took flashbulb shots of the scene as a sudden
influx of delegates and members of their staffs filled the room.
Staying at the Fairmont are Nelson Rockefeller and staff, Czecho
slovakia, Jugoslavia, Belgium, Union of South Africa, Saudi Ara
bia, United States, and Norway.
One official aide typified the feelings of everyone in the lobby
by greeting an old acquaintance, who was wearing the familiar
badge, with:
"My God, everybody's here!"
As taxis with flag stickers designating various countries on
their side windows passed at the usual San Francisco speed, a
four-star Admiral strode across California Avenue.
Meanwhile in Union Square, heart of the city, nothing had
changed, except for the two flags at half-mast. A small man with
a beard parted down the middle fed the pigeons and quietly
watched an overgrown town assimilate the flow of foreign
tongues, red fezzes, unfamiliar uniforms, and good and bad di
plomacy. This was San Francisco the day before it stepped into
history.
On the eve of the San Francisco Conference your two Daily
reporters toured the city, rubbing elbows yesterday with United
Nations diplomats, high-ranking military and naval aides, news
men and photographers, and the man in the street—who was a
little bewildered and goggle-eyed at the moment.
Daily representatives applied for credentials at press head
quarters located in the Veterans Building, center of teeming pre-
Conference activities and nucleus of a well-policed restricted
area where United Nations meetings begin today. Three police
men questioning all those entering the area were genial but firm,
impressing visitors that once the conference has begun the strict
est regulations will be enforced at all points of entrance to the
' area.
Inside the Veterans' Building photographers rushed by with
flashbulb equipment while a group of sailors wheeled a wagon
carrying 15 typewriters into news agency ofifces—the Chinese
Central News Agency, France Presse, INS, and others were rep
resented, with U.P. and A.P. of-ices facing each other at opposite
ends of the lobby.
Foreign delegates received silver label buttons identifying
them as official representatives, who were registering at three

long desks in the lobby. Now covered with signs for each of
the 46 United Nations, these desks will later be used to aid the
delegates with transportation and banking difficulties.
Smaller committee meetings of the Conference will be held
in the auditorium of the Veterans Building, a room approximately
the size of Stanford's Cubberley Auditorium. Yesterday carpen
ters, hurrying to ready the room for these meetings, were setting
up rows of desks facing a long, pale blue speakers' table.
Next door stands the massive War Memorial Opera House
where delegates from all over the world will convene today for
the first time. Daily reporters hoping to glimpse preparations
were refused admittance after dodging in a stage entrance where
a guard demanded special credentials.
San Francisco's hotel lobbies had an atmosphere of subdued
tenseness as delegates arrived in the city. Luggage was stacked
high near the middle of the Fairmont Hotel's flag-draped lobby—
luggage with European hotel stickers, "special pass" railroad
tags, and even a small bundle of Turkish cigarettes.
"We're looking for Czechoslovakian luggage," one of the
bellboys yelled.
"Put the Belgians' over here," replied another.
