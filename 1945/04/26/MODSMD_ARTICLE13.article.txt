LONDON, Thursday, April 26
(UP).-—Two Soviet armies, striking
swift death blows at Nazi Germany,
completed the encirclement of Ber
lin and its fanatic garrison yesterday,
and 70 miles to the south lunged
westward across the Elbe to hasten
a junction with American troops.
German broadcasts said Adolf
Hitler was in the Berlin trap and
would remain in the capital
"where the war will be decided."
Paul Gocbbels, the Reich cabinet,
and members of the high command
also were reported staying in the
capital.
The Russians captured four more
of Berlin's city districts to bring a
total of 37 under their control and
stormed across the Spree River and
Tcltow Canal inside the city. Berlin
said the battle flamed the fuJl length
of the Frankfurterstrasse leading to
the central Alexanderplatz.
Driven from the greater part of
the Berlin built-up area, the Ger
man garrison, including thousands
of 12 to 15-year-old Hitler Youth
members, descended to the city
subways and fought on like cor
nered animals, Moscow dispatches
said.

Iwo Island with their lives. In the background are some of th«
cargo vessels and transports which brought them to the island.
