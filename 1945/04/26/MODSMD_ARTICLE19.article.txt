# Humor Boy Sells Cones Tonight!!
## 
### 
"Buy a cone, buy a cone" will be
the loud cry of the Senior Good Hu
mor Man, Joe Sher, as he and a

group of senior
helpers peddle
ice cream cones
from house to
house tonight
between 8:30 and
0:30.
The cones in
chocolate and
strawberry fla
vors will sell at
10 cents apiece
and will have an
extra amount of
ice cream in

them, as long as the ice cream holds
out.
The old Pi Phi wagon, decorated
with posters, will double as the ice
cream cart, and riding on it will be
B. J. Calfee, Barbara Burroughs,
Connie Frank, Julie Crommelin,
Pat Pierce, Verna Pace, Dick Dris
coll, Bob DeMott and the Good Hu
mor Man.
The group plans to .start at the top
of the Row and work as quickly as
possible toward the P. 0., over to La
gunita and out to Branner, with
countless stops in between.
Proceeds of the ice cream sale tra
ditionally go to the Senior Fund.
