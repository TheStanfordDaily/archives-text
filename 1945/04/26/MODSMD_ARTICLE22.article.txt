WAR MEMORIAL OPERA
HOUSE, SAN FRANCISCO, April 25
(UP). —Meeting at a climactic hour
of the European war, the United Na
tions convened on the Pacific shores
late today to hear President Tru
man's warning that their efforts to
erect an enduring world security
structure must not fail lest increas
ing horrible wars blot out civiliza
tion.
The session was convoked in the
San Francisco Opera House at 4:32
p.m. in a glare of Klieg lights and
with amassed flags of the nations
united in a common effort for war
and peace forming a backdrop for
the proceedings.
After a moment of silent medita
tion loud speakers brought the voice
of President Truman by radio from
Washington calling upon the dele
gates to work in common to estab
lish a peace machinery which would
end for all time the "settlement of
international disputes by bombs and
bayonets."
The Conference opened in an at
mosphere of solemnity heightened by
dispatches from Washington and
from Europe which bore strong hints
that great events in the European
war were in the immediate offing.
Preparation of the text of Presi
dent Truman's Conference - opener
address was delayed while the Chief
Executive went into a sudden and
unexpected conference with the na
tion's high-ranking military and na
val chiefs in Washington's vast Pen
tagon Building.
In Europe the junction of Ameri
can and Russian armies was expected
to be announced at any moment and
there was no indication whether an
nouncements of even wider import
might come just as the Conference
was getting under way.
The undertone of urgency in the
Conference was echoed in a 90-min
utc meeting of the Big Four For
eign Secretaries—Secretary of Stale
Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., Foreign
Commissar V. M. Molotov, Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden, and For
eign Secretary T. V. Soong—which
was called just before the formal
opening of the initial Conference ses
sion. There was no indication what
matters were discussed by the Big
Four, but there was plenty of pos
sible or potential business—the sta
tus of the European war where Ger
many struggled in the last throes of
defeat, the still unresolved Polish
problem and possibly matters of un
finished business in the Pacific where
Russia has denounced her neutrality
pact with Japan.

might come just as the Conference
was getting under way.
The undertone of urgency in the
Conference was echoed in a 90-min

eign Secretaries—Secretary of Stale
Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., Foreign
Commissar V. M. Molotov, Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden, and For
eign Secretary T. V. Soong—which
was called just before the formal
opening of the initial Conference ses
sion. There was no indication what
matters were discussed by the Big
Four, but there was plenty of pos
sible or potential business—the sta
tus of the European war where Ger
many struggled in the last throes of
defeat, the still unresolved Polish
problem and possibly matters of un
finished business in the Pacific where
Russia has denounced her neutrality
pact with Japan.
WAR MEMORIAL OPERA
HOUSE, SAN FRANCISCO, April 25
(UP). —Meeting at a climactic hour
of the European war, the United Na
tions convened on the Pacific shores
late today to hear President Tru
man's warning that their efforts to
erect an enduring world security
structure must not fail lest increas
ing horrible wars blot out civiliza
tion.
The session was convoked in the
San Francisco Opera House at 4:32
p.m. in a glare of Klieg lights and
with amassed flags of the nations
united in a common effort for war
and peace forming a backdrop for
the proceedings.
After a moment of silent medita
tion loud speakers brought the voice
of President Truman by radio from
Washington calling upon the dele
gates to work in common to estab
lish a peace machinery which would
end for all time the "settlement of
international disputes by bombs and
bayonets."
The Conference opened in an at
mosphere of solemnity heightened by
dispatches from Washington and
from Europe which bore strong hints
that great events in the European
war were in the immediate offing.
Preparation of the text of Presi
dent Truman's Conference - opener
address was delayed while the Chief
Executive went into a sudden and
unexpected conference with the na
tion's high-ranking military and na
val chiefs in Washington's vast Pen
tagon Building.
In Europe the junction of Ameri
can and Russian armies was expected
to be announced at any moment and
there was no indication whether an
nouncements of even wider import
might come just as the Conference
was getting under way.
The undertone of urgency in the
Conference was echoed in a 90-min

Commissar V. M. Molotov, Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden, and For
eign Secretary T. V. Soong—which
