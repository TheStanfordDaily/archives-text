# Stevens To Sing Monday in Opera House Concert
## 
### 
One of the few Opera House at
tractions in San Francisco open to
the public during the period of the
United Nations Conference will be
the concert of Rise Stevens of the
Metropolitan Opera Company. Her
concert is scheduled for Monday
evening, April 30.
Miss Stevens, well known to local
audiences for her concert and opera
performances here, is an American
born artist, although her parents
were Norwegians. She is known as
the young woman who shattered all
tradition by rejecting a Metropolitan
offer because she was not sufficiently
prepared.
Tickets for the concert are now
on sale at the Opera Box Office, City
of Paris, EXbrook 8585.
