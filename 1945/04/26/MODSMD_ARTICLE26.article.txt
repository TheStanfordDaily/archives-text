THE SMALL NATIONS
Yesterday we ran an editorial by Bill Adams
w ich we felt expressed well the overall di
lemma that people are finding who are now
not "just talking," but are in Europe and Asia
with the rehabilitation committees, the relief
committees, or Allied military governments.
Everywhere we are sending people, mostly
unknown personalities, and by their routine
ev< ryJ.iy work the many peoples of the world
wili know and judge the United States.
Yesterday's editorial called for a plan that
could be followed to represent our well-propa
ganuized dims to the peoples of the world who
mus have working goals.
These aims would also more or less provide
a real work for our policy-makers to accomplish
at the United Nations Conferences, at present
and in the future.
Or e of our largest and most celebrated catch
wor s is our vaunted "respect for the rights of
small nations."
Yet everywhere that our commissions go we
know of misunderstanding of the customs and
the sympathies of other people. A definite pro
cj nof piovisions for religious freedom could
be provided.
Of greater difficulty is the determination of
the law that should be in effect. The demon
::a\iiions by the people of France and Italy, for
ins', ice, who punished their own Nazi-sympa
thk.3rs were revolting displays of mass-hysteria,
destined to lay the seeds of future hatreds.
V/e are allowing too much injustice to be
passed out in the name of war punishment.
Conguered people may resent, at first, being
unable to do vengeful acts, but in the long run,
their respect for Yankee order, both for the oc
cuj i d nation and our own troops, would
fiiTC i-gthen our position.
Tho Belgian minister in San Francisco said
wh .n asked about his stand at the conference,
"We are a small nation, we must wait our
chance to speak." There is bitterness in a re
mark like that that will underlie the acceptance
of all that may be accomplished.
Though we continually talk sympathetically
of "small nations" we have difficulty in ear
nestly considering the programs of small na
tions, individually, which is the test of our faith
in provisions for small nations that have been
re .do, and mostly ignored, from the fourteen
points to the Atlantic Charter.
We blame the Javanese for their poverty, the
Filipinos for their rude houses, the Latin Ameri
cans for their revolutions. Even though we are
taught the reasons, our practice shows that
they color our understanding too much.
Oh, how the Latin Americans must vision
the United States, with its constant newsreels
showing pickets running from union-industry
strikes with blood streaming down their faces,
and headlines and pictures of the militia enter
ing the areas with clubs and time bombs.
One of the long-overdue rules of our national
policy abroad is the careful respect we must
pay to the rights of others for their religion,
language, customs, and their rights on earth to
be considered as knowing what they want done
in their country.
We are overplaying the role of the conguer
ing hero, and the game that order in a country
means ignorance of their problems.
We can learn a lesson from the Russians who
have revised the leaning of the Balkan nations,
by recognizing that they do have problems and
helping and even providing for their solution.
If we are not liberal in allowing for their in
tcrr sts, some day a menacing power will be,
for reasons of self-interest.
For two wars the little peoples of the world
have looked to Uncle Sam because he was
strong and because he did not seem to pursue
selfish interests, but if his own shortsightedness
r:iid stupidity stand in the way once more, they
rosy not be ready to listen again for a long
time.
