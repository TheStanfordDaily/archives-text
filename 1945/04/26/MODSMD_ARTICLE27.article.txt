VARIOUS ATTITUDES AT THE UNCIO
( lenient Attlee, loader of Britain's Labor party, and
i time Minister Churchill's right hand man, made sev
cial interesting assertions in San Francisco yesterday
( oricerning world peace. He declared that permanent
Jicace among nations cannot endure alone on a foun
dation of security but must be bulwarked with pros
perity.
Flo spoke of several distinct sides to (he San Fran
cisco Conference, "trying to build up the means of
preventing war" and "eliminating the conditions
which make wars easy to start." He believes we
should have a prosperity organization as well as a
security organization to prevent war.
He stated that one cause of this war was the great

depression of the 'thirties. According to him it was
due to the fact that our economic system failed to
create abundance and went on the line of artificial
scarcity. He expressed the hope that the nations will
never again allow food to be destroyed in one country
while people are starving in another.
lie said, "We have got to get a freer interchange of
services and commodities, if we are to raise the stan
dard of life. Europe has got to get away from narrow
economic nationalism."
Britons have suffered profoundly from the war and
are willing to give and take at the conference.
"All of us are anticipating building up something
necessary to raise the standard of life of all our peo
ple. We see in this conference the possibility of
building up an organization which, on the negative
side will prevent war, and, on the positive side,
building up human betterment and social progress."
"We know,"he said, "that none of us will get exactly
what we want, but we will have discussions and get the
best possible agreement."
The agreement he emphasized will have basis in
the Dumbarton Oaks' proposals which he believes are
sound but must be implemented.
He concludes, "We shouldn't just have a debating so
ciety but a world organization with the will to act and
the power to act. We're looking at this conference as
not an idle dream of some perfectionist but as a very
practical thing. Behind that we are deeply concerned
with an organization which will try to make full use of
the powers of the world to give a decent life to all our
people. It can be done."

are willing to give and take at the conference.
"All of us are anticipating building up something
necessary to raise the standard of life of all our peo
ple. We see in this conference the possibility of
building up an organization which, on the negative
side will prevent war, and, on the positive side,
building up human betterment and social progress."
"We know,"he said, "that none of us will get exactly
what we want, but we will have discussions and get the
best possible agreement."
The agreement he emphasized will have basis in
the Dumbarton Oaks' proposals which he believes are
sound but must be implemented.
He concludes, "We shouldn't just have a debating so
ciety but a world organization with the will to act and
the power to act. We're looking at this conference as
not an idle dream of some perfectionist but as a very
practical thing. Behind that we are deeply concerned
with an organization which will try to make full use of
the powers of the world to give a decent life to all our
people. It can be done."
