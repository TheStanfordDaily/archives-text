# OUR HASHER
## 
### JOE SHER 
(Just in case there was any doubt in anybody's
mind, the Campus' favorite hasher has come out of
seclusion to give the inside info on Saturday's Junior
Water Carnival).
The usual introduction to a water carnival runs
something like this: Beautiful girls with shapely anato
mies, bronzed muscular men, pageants unexcelled be
fore on earth for their beauty, difficulty, and original
ity, gorgeous floats, decorated with beautiful flowers,
and dancing girls.
But on Saturday the Junior class will present their
own water carnival and the scene will run something
like this:
The usual Stanford women, (thousands to be sure)
with their bulging biceps and brown bodies (obtained
through hours of sun on the roofs of their various resi
dences), a few scrawny males with their minor ail
ments which have been magnified to fool unobservant
draft boards.
LADIES TO THE FORE
The pageants and floats will consist of a few canoes
covered with chicken wire and cheese cloth and flowers
jobbed from the faculty gardens on the campus (Profs
beware), and a variety of events which will cause a
tremendous amount of exhaustion and distress for the
out-of-condition males, and no end of satisfaction for
the sturdy Stanford women who will probably win all
of the events that they enter.
The clear blue water of the ordinary pools will be
substituted for the cholera ridden waters of Lagunita
and thousands of pollywogs will have the greatest num
ber entered, all of them bitter at the frivilous humans
who are retarding their metamorphoses (Biology I) by
the human inhalation of the "wee beasties." Lanes
have been cut in the seaweed that infests the pond
and through these the eager contestants will wallow
and swallow.
SCINTILLATION YET!
Comedy divers from the city will aid the program.
These little men recently received their old age pen
sions and are so happy about the whole situation that
they were induced to come down to the Farm and
put on a little show out of the goodness of their hearts
and the fact they are getting nine thousand dollars
for their expenses.
A brief resume of the events shows us that we are
having canoe filling races, canoe jousting, canoe turn
over races, and log rolling among the scintillating hap
penings of the afternoon.
This canoe-filling contest is a cinch; all you have to
do is get 55 people into the canoe and you get the prize
for this event which is marvelous. It is a complete
set of bacteriacides which will come in very handy, for
if you can get 55 people in one of the leaky tubs at
the boathouse you are going to get plenty of chance
to use the stuff, for the bacteria are plentiful on the
bottom.
The other events show equal promise and should
be lots of fun for the people watching, and the frogs.
