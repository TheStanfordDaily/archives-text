The feeling that exists against the wearing of wigs
and beards is hard to explain. In the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Centuries, gentlemen were only too willing
to hide the scanty growth left them by the passing of
years. Underneath a luxurious full-bottomed wig a
man could once more imagine himself in the days of
his youth.
A glance in the mirror each morning before leaving
the house would confirm the presence of heavy locks
still colored with the pristine pigment of their salad
days. Thus armed with confidence in his appearance,
the Seventeenth Century gentleman could sally forth
to his day's task, buoyed up with gratification and self
esteem.
How sadly different is our present plight! In our
younger days we submit to the tyranny of barbers
(the word is derived from the same source as "bar
barian."). Intended by Nature to Haunt our crowning
glory to an even greater extent than the less hirsute
female, we nevertheless chop and crop as if our ideal
of manly beauty were a plucked rooster.
All that has been said of hair on the head is also true
of beards. Encouraged by the greedy-eyed manufac
turers of steel, we purchase short slivers of metal to
perform operations of a painful nature on our faces.
After each morning ordeal it is necessary to apply
soothing medicaments to allay the damage afflicted on
the epidermis. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals are
thus drawn into the plot against us.
There is something servile and unmanly about a
smooth-shaved face. Immature boys, flunkeys and
women, are all beardless. But the mature and in
dependent man is traditionally and by Nature beard
ed and long-haired.
It is noteworthy how the mere wearing of a beard
adds an aspect of wisdom to a man's appearance. And
what wearer of a beard could be imagined as otherwise
than dignified.
As the development of the machine age provides lei
sure for men the emergence of the beard will once more
take place. No longer enslaved to a daily routine, no
longer subservient to the will of those whose psycho
logical comfort is maintained by thwarting their under
lings, every man will be free to develop his personality
in his own way.
The heard is Nature's method of exposing individ
ual differences. The present stereotyped facial design
will he replaced by a series of characteristic visages,
each one a separate work of art, expressive of its
owner's temperament, ability and cultural hack
ground.
The loss to the makers of razors, blades, shaving
creams, lotions and face powders, will be more than
made up to the rest of mankind as they discover an
other outlet for per.'ional expression and as they enjoy
the more varied scenes of life passing on the streets.

of manly beauty were a plucked rooster.
All that has been said of hair on the head is also true
of beards. Encouraged by the greedy-eyed manufac
turers of steel, we purchase short slivers of metal to
perform operations of a painful nature on our faces.
After each morning ordeal it is necessary to apply
soothing medicaments to allay the damage afflicted on
the epidermis. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals are
thus drawn into the plot against us.
There is something servile and unmanly about a
smooth-shaved face. Immature boys, flunkeys and
women, are all beardless. But the mature and in
dependent man is traditionally and by Nature beard
ed and long-haired.
It is noteworthy how the mere wearing of a beard
adds an aspect of wisdom to a man's appearance. And
what wearer of a beard could be imagined as otherwise
than dignified.
As the development of the machine age provides lei
sure for men the emergence of the beard will once more
take place. No longer enslaved to a daily routine, no
longer subservient to the will of those whose psycho
logical comfort is maintained by thwarting their under
lings, every man will be free to develop his personality
in his own way.
The heard is Nature's method of exposing individ

will he replaced by a series of characteristic visages,
each one a separate work of art, expressive of its
owner's temperament, ability and cultural hack

The loss to the makers of razors, blades, shaving
creams, lotions and face powders, will be more than
made up to the rest of mankind as they discover an
other outlet for per.'ional expression and as they enjoy
the more varied scenes of life passing on the streets.
Sydney Hons,
The feeling that exists against the wearing of wigs
and beards is hard to explain. In the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Centuries, gentlemen were only too willing
to hide the scanty growth left them by the passing of
years. Underneath a luxurious full-bottomed wig a
man could once more imagine himself in the days of
his youth.
A glance in the mirror each morning before leaving
the house would confirm the presence of heavy locks
still colored with the pristine pigment of their salad
days. Thus armed with confidence in his appearance,
the Seventeenth Century gentleman could sally forth
to his day's task, buoyed up with gratification and self
esteem.
How sadly different is our present plight! In our
younger days we submit to the tyranny of barbers
(the word is derived from the same source as "bar
barian."). Intended by Nature to Haunt our crowning
glory to an even greater extent than the less hirsute
female, we nevertheless chop and crop as if our ideal
of manly beauty were a plucked rooster.
