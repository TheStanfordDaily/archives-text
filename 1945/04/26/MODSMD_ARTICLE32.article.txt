# Spring Sing Entries Due
## 
### 
If you've been wondering what the
strange sounds are that have been
emanating from campus living
groups lately, then your fears are
over. No, Farm students are not go
ing crazy with the heat. They are
just practicing for the coming Spring
Sing.
Scheduled to take place the eve
ning of Friday, June 1, in the Frost
Memorial Amphitheater, the Sing
will determine the best musical pres
entation by living groups or combi
nation of living groups.
The annual Sing is sponsored by
Cardinals, this year under the chair
manship of Cardinals member Mar
tha Austin. All song entries should
be registered at the A.S.S.U. office
before May 18 —and as soon as pos
sible before that date so that selec
tion may be adjusted in cases of du
plication, said Miss Austin. Entry
fee is 50 cents.
In view of the outcome of last
year's Sing, Cardinals made a ruling
that entries from women's living
groups have no less than 25 singers.
In this way, the number of selec
tions will be cut down and the qual
ity of singing will probably be im
proved, Cardinals decided.
Repeating his emcee performance
of last year's Sing will be Ric Supple,
who will again introduce campus
singers vieing for the three trophies.
Awards will be made to the best
women's, the best men's, and the best
graduate groups. They will be based
on points for such items as appear
ance of group, type and arrangement
of selection, and tonal quality, and
will be judged by six faculty mem
bers.
Winners will be announced at the
close of the Sing. Last year's win
ners were Casa Granada, the SAE\s,
and the Med School.
