## Mason Twirls P.A.I. To Win Over Lincoln 
### BOB SLOBE 
A fighting Palo Alto Independent
squad gleaned their first victory to
day at the expense of Lincoln High
of San Jose. Although rain threat
ened to end the game in the early
innings, it ceased pouring at the end
of the first frame and permitted the
game to go to its successful conclu
sion. The "Independents" chalked up
4 runs on 11 hits as against 2 runs
on 4 hits for the Lincoln High nine.
Mason Baffles Opponents
"Doc" Mason pitched a great game
for the victors. The first inning saw
the San Jose boys go into an early
lead when Ingram slammed Mason's
first toss for a double along the left

J field foul line and score later in the
inning on an error.
The boys from Stanford knotted
the count in their half of the frame
when Joe Sher socked a sharp
triple into left center field and
crossed the plate on Ted Morrison's
single into right. In the top half
of the second, Mason, fully warmed
up. proceeded to baffle the opposi
tion with his fastball. In this in
ninÂ«r he hung up two of his 13
strikeouts, an average of almost
two to an inning.
In the third Morrison got his sec
ond hit of the day and advanced to
second on Ashley's line single into
center. Team manager Bob Rosburg
came through with a base knock
scoring Morrison and again tying up
j the ball game, San Jose having
j scored another counter by virtue of
j a single and a double. The fourth
| saw Mason at his best, for he struck
three batters out.
Fox Socks Homer
In the Independents' half of the
fourth, the home team took the lead
which they never lost again. Mason
walked to open, and Dennis Fox
greeted Padilla, the San Jose hurler,
with a long home-run that rolled all
the way to left field fence and ran
the score to four to two in favor of
the locals.
The "Independents" then coasted
on to an easy triumph, the rest of the
game being uneventful. San Jose
hoping for revenge has invited the
P.A.I, squad to a game next Monday
to be played on the Lincoln school's
home grounds.
Win Impressive
This win looks like the start of a
successful season for the "Independ
ents," for they have a first-class
hurler in "Doc" Mason and tight in
field and outfield. Ample support by
Stanford students is all that is lack
ing to make their season a complete
success. The support for yesterday's
game was well supplied by "Sarge"
Casey, who really took the interests
of the team to heart and kept them
in there pitching all the time.
