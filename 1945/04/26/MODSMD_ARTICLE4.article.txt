# Program A Sellout
## Rubinstein Piano Concert 'Brilliant' 
### RUTH GUMBRECHT 
In a brillian piano concert Artur
! Rubinstein last night delivered a
I performance which far exceeds pre
j vious Concert Scries programs of
J this season. His masterful playing
overwhelmed the audience which
filled Memorial Hall to capacity for
the third Series presentation of 1044-
45.
Opening with Beethoven's rela
tively unfamiliar "Sonata," opus 31,
No. 3, in E fiat," Mr. Rubinstein gave
! a well-rounded program which in
j eluded "Capriccio, opus 76" and
."Rhapsody, opus 119" by Brahms;
and "Sonata in B Minor" by Liszt.
He followed these with four short
selections from Debussy; and "Bal
lada in G Minor," two Etudes, and
"Polonaise, opus 53," all by Chopin.
Brahms Forccful, Colorful
j The somewhat playful and roman
i tic style displayed in Brahms' "Ca
| priccio" was accurately interpreted
by Mr. Rubinstein in a colorful pcr
! formance. The "Rhapsody," with its
| strong chords and forceful runs, also
j gave a touch of romanticism con
! trasting with Beethoven's preceding
â–  classic work.
J The highlight of the evening's se
lections came with a dramatic and
vibrant offering of Liszt's "Sonata in
B Minor." Opening the work in som
ber notes of despair, then working
up into beautiful crescendos and
coming forth with strong chords,
i Mr. Rubinstein worked into varying
| moods of color and tone.

Spiritual Quality of Debussy
The ethereal and transparent qual
! itics suggestive of nature in the se
lections by Debussy were done in
I great subtlety. The almost sad, yet
| moving, feeling of nostalgia found
j in the "Valse" and "La Plus que
] Lonte" was typical of Debussy's
! spiritual quality.
I The Chopin works on the program
were Mr. Rubinstein's best. The
j technique displayed in the two
) Etudes and the stirring melodies in
; the "Polonaise" and "Ballada" were
j marked evidence that Chopin is Mr.
| Rubinstein's composer.
The encores for the evening in
cluded the soothing "Berceuse" of
| Chopin and the light, fanciful "Pol
| ka" by Shostakovitch.
The Concert Series office reported
j the concert a complete sellout.
