# Medics Battle Monroe Boozers
## 
### 
In what should be an outstanding
game, the Monroe Boozers face the
Med School today, in the sunken
diamond; this might be the clincher
of the year. So far, Monroe has been
undefeated, and except for a close
game with the Phi Psi, has white
washed >ts opponents.
However, the Med School, which
entered late but is undefeated, upset
the highly-touted Phi Psi aggrega
j tion 6-3 yesterday and set themselves
up as positive title contenders. This
game will probably be another pitch
ing duel with Joe Sher of the Booz
ers and Doc Mason of the Medics,
I battling it out. The contest will prob
j ably be close all the way.
In another top-notch game, the
Legal Eagles face the Phi Psi's. Both
I of these squads have met with one
loss and both are strong. The pitch
ing of Luke Pitts will probably mean
the difference between victory and
defeat.
In the other games of the day,
Buchanan faces Arguello, and Tylei
faces the Flacks. Both of these games
are toss-ups. Each of the four teams
have seen good days, and have tasted
bad days; it will all depend on how
fate treats them voday.
