# 'Village' Dance Campus- Wide
## 
### 
"You can do better here."
So says the sign that will be post
ed in front of Jane Lathrop House
this Saturday night to advertise to
Farm Water Carnival celebrators the
news of their "Greenwich Village"
dance.
Given annually by the Chi Ome
gas at Junior Water Carnival time,
the all-campus dance will last from
9 to 12, with refreshments dispensed
from the Omar Chi-0 bar from
12 to 1.
Traditional "old New York" dec
orations will adorn Lathrop House
walls, with colored clothes-lines and
checkered tablecloths in full sway.
The old washerwoman will scrub
clothes over a washboard in a wood
en tub. (But don't be worried, she's
I only a robot!)
Officiating at the fortune teller's
booth will be Mrs. Dare Stark Mc-
Mullin, who promises to foretell the
futures Farm students have in store
for ihemseives.
Keynoting the affair will be in
formal dancing to the tune of the
nation's "lop bands," supplied danc
ers through the courtesy of the pho
nograph.
Committee chairman for the dance
is Betty Putnam, assisted by Kallie
Tremaine, decorations; Nan Bolen
der, refreshments; and Coreen Con
sidine, publicity.
