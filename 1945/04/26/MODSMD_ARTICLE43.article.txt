# Lawson Returns To Pre-Flight
## 
### 
Lieutenant Jim Lawson, who was
head football coach at Stanford at
the time he was commissioned in
the Navy three years ago, has re
turned to St. Mary's Pre-Flight.
Lawson acted as assistant football
coach at Pre-Flight in 1542 and was
instrumental in turning out one of
the best teams in the nation. He left
in 1943 and served a tour of duty at
Flight Prep School in Seattle and
later at Naval Operations School in
Washington, D. C.
Assigned to sea duty in 1944, he
served aboard the U.S.S. West Vir
ginia and was in the battle of Surigao
Straights last October. It was in this
battle that the Fleet turned back the
Japanese flotilla and won one of the
greatest naval victories of the war.
