# Chem Fraternity To Hold Initiation Banquet Tonight
## 
### 
lota Sigma Pi, women's national
chemical fraternity, will hold its an
nual initiation of members at a
banquet this evening. The banquet
will be held at the home of Mrs.
Jacqueline Ogg. The girls will meet
at Lagunita at G p.m. and transpor
tation will be provided.
lota Sigma Pi is an honorary fra
ternity whose members are se
lected on the basis of their scholar
ship in chemistry. Members must
have completed at least 30 units of
chemistry with an average grade of
B or higher.
This year's initiation sets a record
with 15 new members invited to en
ter the organization. The average in
past years has been three or four
new members each year. Mrs. Eve
lyn Mcßain, faculty adviser of the
fraternity, explained that this in
crease is due to the increased oppor
tunity for women in the fields of
chemistry and medicine.
"The fact that a generation of men
scientists and doctors have been di
verted from continuing their educa
tion, provides plenty of opportunity
for women in these fields," said Mrs.
Mcßain, a former national president
of the fraternity.
Another activity of this fraternity
is the annual awarding of the lota
cup to the freshman woman student
who has the best record in the first
year chemistry course. The decision
for this year has not yet been made,
but will be announced soon.
