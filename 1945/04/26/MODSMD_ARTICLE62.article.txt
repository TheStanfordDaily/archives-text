# Children Express Thanks For Con Home Treatment
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Michael is a bed patient at the Con Home. He ft suffering from ex
posure and malnutrition as a result of many months in the jungles of
the Philippines, evading Nipponese troops. He has never seen toys before,
and because he has had little opportunity for friendships, he can't quite
believe his luck in having so many young companions at the Home.

Perhaps traceable to the days be
fore the escape, when Michael and
his family built grass shacks in the
jungles, barely ahead of the ap
proaching Japs—is the little boy's
fascination for constructing with
blocks and paper cut-outs.
Children Need Toys
Because there are many such
children at the Home, who are un
able to climb into the tree-house, or
hold meetings in the boys' clubhouse,
or swing, or slide, or play in the
sand-box, toys for the daily play pe
riod are being asked from Stanford
students as gifts to the bed patients.
Animals, dolls, and paper construc
tion sets are needed, but none that
require the use of razors for cutting,
because of possible injury to the
children. Roble Corridor 3A will
paint and furnish a doll-house for
the children, and Phyllis Graham is
in charge of collection of the toys in
all living groups. Branner, Roble,
Lagunita, and Storey House will be
points at which toys will be picked
up.
Tuesday is letter-writing day at
the Home. One child wrote to Mrs.
Timothy Hopkins, founder of the
Home, who was ill, "We hope you
have as nice a place to be ill in as
we have." Play-hours in the yard,
or afternoons on the sun porch; les
sons conducted in the wards, or in
the little Home school-house; picnic
lunches and ice cream and glasses
of milk in mid-afternoon—all these
belong on the week's routine for the
children.
Child Writes Letter
Wrote one child, "I don't want to
go home because I like it better here.
I can eat all I want. So that's why
I like it here."
Many of the children are kept in
the Home with the funds of the
Community Chest, and local chari
ties and services. Parents of some
are able to pay, and do so by dona
tion. The price of supporting a child
in the Home for one day is $2.75, and
from each student at Stanford this
donation is asked, as part of his con
tribution to the annual Con Home
Drive.
A letter from "Gimp" said, "The
school here is better than I have in
San Francisco."
Curriculum Given
On the windows of the schoolhouse
are pasted colored-paper silhouettes
of potted tulips—a remnant of Easter
activities. Reading, writing, and
long - division are included in the
school's curriculum, but specialty of
the children is the toy orchestra—
combining drums, triangle, and horns
— which accompanies professional
recordings.
Wednesday all students may visit
the Home as workers for the annual
Labor Day—painting toys, working
in the victory garden under the su
pervision of Sam Mac Donald, re
pairing the tree-house, and cleaning
in the yard. Cokes, popcorn, oranges
and novelty ice-cream bars will be
sold to benefit the Home and to re
fresh the workers.
Box Lunchcs to Be Served
Midge Hexter, barbecue chairman,
announced that box lunches will be
served on an all-campus scale at 5
p.m. Army students are encouraged
to come following their classes, as

skits and band music will top off the
day's activities.
Letters of appreciation from the
child ren described Labor Day in !
j glowing terms, and added that Stan
ford coeds were "the prettiest girls
! we ever saw."

Child Writes Letter
Wrote one child, "I don't want to
go home because I like it better here.
I can eat all I want. So that's why
I like it here."
Many of the children are kept in
the Home with the funds of the
Community Chest, and local chari
ties and services. Parents of some
are able to pay, and do so by dona
tion. The price of supporting a child
in the Home for one day is $2.75, and
from each student at Stanford this
donation is asked, as part of his con
tribution to the annual Con Home
Drive.
A letter from "Gimp" said, "The
school here is better than I have in
San Francisco."
Curriculum Given
On the windows of the schoolhouse
are pasted colored-paper silhouettes
of potted tulips—a remnant of Easter
activities. Reading, writing, and
long - division are included in the
school's curriculum, but specialty of
the children is the toy orchestra—
combining drums, triangle, and horns
— which accompanies professional
recordings.
Wednesday all students may visit
the Home as workers for the annual
Labor Day—painting toys, working
in the victory garden under the su
pervision of Sam Mac Donald, re
pairing the tree-house, and cleaning
in the yard. Cokes, popcorn, oranges
and novelty ice-cream bars will be
sold to benefit the Home and to re
fresh the workers.
Box Lunchcs to Be Served
Midge Hexter, barbecue chairman,
announced that box lunches will be
served on an all-campus scale at 5
p.m. Army students are encouraged
to come following their classes, as

skits and band music will top off the
day's activities.
Letters of appreciation from the
child ren described Labor Day in !
j glowing terms, and added that Stan
ford coeds were "the prettiest girls

Michael is a bed patient at the Con Home. He ft suffering from ex
posure and malnutrition as a result of many months in the jungles of
the Philippines, evading Nipponese troops. He has never seen toys before,
and because he has had little opportunity for friendships, he can't quite
believe his luck in having so many young companions at the Home.

Perhaps traceable to the days be
fore the escape, when Michael and
his family built grass shacks in the
jungles, barely ahead of the ap
proaching Japs—is the little boy's
fascination for constructing with
blocks and paper cut-outs.
Children Need Toys
Because there are many such
children at the Home, who are un
able to climb into the tree-house, or
hold meetings in the boys' clubhouse,
or swing, or slide, or play in the
sand-box, toys for the daily play pe
riod are being asked from Stanford
students as gifts to the bed patients.
Animals, dolls, and paper construc
tion sets are needed, but none that
require the use of razors for cutting,
because of possible injury to the
children. Roble Corridor 3A will
paint and furnish a doll-house for
the children, and Phyllis Graham is
in charge of collection of the toys in
all living groups. Branner, Roble,
Lagunita, and Storey House will be
points at which toys will be picked
up.
Tuesday is letter-writing day at
the Home. One child wrote to Mrs.
Timothy Hopkins, founder of the
Home, who was ill, "We hope you
have as nice a place to be ill in as
we have." Play-hours in the yard,
or afternoons on the sun porch; les
sons conducted in the wards, or in
the little Home school-house; picnic
lunches and ice cream and glasses
of milk in mid-afternoon—all these
belong on the week's routine for the
children.
