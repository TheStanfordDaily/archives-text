# Your Dimes Are Needed For Sophomore Carnival
## 
### 
Carnival-time will come to the
Farm Friday, May 4, when the soph
omores open wide the doors of the
Pavilion and invite the whole campus
to spend their dimes shooting water
pistols, sending telegrams and buying
fuzzy root beers.
Twenty-seven living-groups have
volunteered to sponsor concessions,
and to turn over profits, as is tradi
tional, to the Convalescent Home
Drive. Those who have not turned
in their ideas for concessions should
do so sometime today, according to
Chairman Johnny Jenkins.
Women's groups on the Row
should phone Merle Bcuutcl, 8660;
Lagunita, Union, and freshman
women's groups should phone Mil
dred Edwards, 22151, and men's
groups should phone Jack Siemer,
8644.

"Step right up" to the Army stu

Women from The Oaks, entitling
their concession "Oak Limbs," offer
the chance for carnival-goers to
throw hoops over their limbs—clad
in black mesh stockings and pink
rose garters.
Dunking for the Con Home will be
undergone by women from Russell
House, who will receive a deluge of
water every time student marksmen
hit the bull's-eye with a baseball.
Fortune-tellers will sit behind the

curtains of the Hawthorne booth,
Mariposa will sponsor a freak show,
and Jordan will add to the general
humidity with another water show.
Roble taxi-dancers will perform
for 10 cents a dance, to the music of
the Army band.
Varga (iirls
Buchanan's Varga girl display
caused a wild sensation at last year's
carnival, according to Jenkins, so
back it will come this year—with
bigger and better Varga girls.
Tyler's 'rat race" hasn't been de

—and offer prizes to all those who
are successful in knocking them
down to the head.
Elm's artists will sketch all stu
dents who pay the fee. Union will
be sending telegrams all over the
Pavilion, so start thinking up mes

Washington Hall will oversee a
ski-ball game, and offer prizes to
high scorers.
Ix>ads of Food
Candied apples, root beer, ice
cream and cokes will be sold at other
booths, and numerous other conces

entertainment, according to Jenkins.
Soph President Frank de Lisle has
taken on the job of constructing
booths for the affair, and class sec
retary Margaret Kehoe will head fi
nances.
Nancy Norton is in charge of pub
licity, and Jim Wilcox will handle
police; Ray Sandei-s, lighting.
Script tickets may be purchased
from six booths around the floor at 10
cents apiece. And remember—every
cent you spend at the Carnival will
go to the Con Home, where conva
lescent children arc trying to regain
their health.
