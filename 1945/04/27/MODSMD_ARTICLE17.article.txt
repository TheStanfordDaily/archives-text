# Padrewski, Con Home To Share Sunday Billing
## 
### 
Last year's Con Home helpers can
see themselves in the colored film to
be shown Sunday at the Memorial
Auditorium at 7:15, with the famous
"Moonlight Sonata," only picture in
which Ignace Jan Paderewski ever
appeared.
In the foreign film, Paderewski
plays Chopin's "Polonaise in A Flat
Major"; Beethoven's "Moonlight So
nata"; Liszt's "Hungarian Rhap
sody" ;and his own "Minuet in G
Major."
