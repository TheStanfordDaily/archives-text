# THE 						TEST CASE
## THE 						PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 
### 
It has been said before and it will be said
again that the United Nations Conference now
in session in San Francisco is the most import
ant conference that has yet been held to formu
late a firm and definite plan for peace.
That Ihis peace must be an organized peace
for :;omG years to come is a fact that, though
we may not like it too much, we cannot evade.
Some people have said that peace, any kind of
poa o, would be welcome after the horror and
destruction that has prevailed all during the
present war.
This is not :;o. Any kind of peace will not be
enough; any kind of peace, disorganized and
embarked on without forethought, would only
lead us into a third world war, the magnitude
and chaos of which we cannot even imagine.
The part the United States will play in main
taining this pcace is a great one. We are today
the only powerful country in the world that has
remained untouched by the ravages of war. We
have enormous wealth coupled with the power
of a people who are still, we hope, mentally
liedlthy and alert.
The world looks to the United States as its
chief bulwark to restore economic security to
the.' war devastated nations. And the way to help
every nation help itsell to recover economic
<;>. urity is by encouraging a free and open flow
of tiade.
Perhaps closest to the United States now in
the working of this kind of trade is a nation
wh■ fi, itself, is part of the United States the
Philippine Islands.
In three years of destructive Japanese occu
pation, the Filipinos have seen nearly every
one of Iheir advances toward economic self
: deficiency go up in smoke. Rich in resources,
the Philippines are a potential gold-mine to any
far-seeing business man.
But today, the Philippines are in ruins. More
ihan 70 per cent of Manila is completely de
stroyed. Factories have been destroyed, or their
machinery taken by the Japs—and the same is
true of Iheir other industries: gold, lumber, and
others.
The work of restoring the islands to even their
former level of economic stability will require
years of rehabilitation.
But next year, under the Tydings-McDuffie
/• r:t of 1936, the Philippines are due to gain their
i'[dependence. That they deserve this there can
be no doubt. Taken by the United States against
their will, Filipinos have stood loyally by us
through the most severe trial in their history.
But after independence, what? Already Am
erican sugar and dairy interests are proposing
<' complete' cessation of the trade privileges we
cic orded the Filipinos as a subject nation.
Already tariffs against Philippine imports are
being proposed, tariffs which are too high for
the Philippines to pay, and which would only
succeed in strangulation of trade between the
United States and the Islands.
We cannot afford to lose a lucrative trade
with the Philippines, and what is more import
ant, we cannot afford to lose the friendship and
the faith and trust they have placed in us.
Trade with the Philippines is not a one-way
aifair. Today, more than ever, they need every
thing we can sell them; and the list of their
products which we vitally need and do not pro
duce is a long one.
The situation that the dairy business is in is
a farcical one. A Daily interview with Albert
W. C. T. Herre revealed that nearly all dairy
products used in the islands are imported from
the United States, and cutting off this valuable
market would mean a serious curtailing of the
dairy products trade.
Kven American sugar interests are acting only
from a fear of what might happen. Almost all
the sugar produced in the islands is kept there
for the Filipinos' own use, as is true of nearly
'•very agricultural and industrial enterprise they
maintain.
But the worst results of erecting high tariff
b iiriers against the Philippines would fall right
on our own Pacific coast. Before the war, nearly
all trade carried on in the Philippines went be
tween there and the west coast.
I he islands themselves would not suffer bad-
I/, for they would soon find other nations eager
to buy the things they can produce. But the Far
.1 .'astern trading companies on this coast would
oon fall idle, as would a large number of dock

workers and middlemen, who. although they
may not know it, keep their jobs because of
trade with the Philippines.
We have a trust not only with the Philippines,
but also with ourselves that we cannot fail to
keep. And it is up to the people of America to
see that we keep it. For our experience with
the islands is a small example of what can be
done on a world-wide scale.
Even more important to us is the effect that
our policy concerning the Philippines will have
on other nations of the world. The rest of the
world has a natural right to expect that what we
do with and to the Philippines, we will do to
ether nations. If we curtail fair trade with our
own possessions after they have gained inde
pendence, would not other nations expect an
even worse attitude toward themselves-
Free and open trade with other countries
works not only to their benefit, but also to ours,
to an extent which few Americans can imagine.
By adopting a policy of friendly trade we can
gain the respect, admiration, and trust of every
country with which we deal. And this, more
than anything, will help to guarantee us and
the world a secure and lasting peace.
