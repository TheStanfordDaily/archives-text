### PEGGY FITTS 
It looks like a big weekend. A bigger week
end than usual, which is saying something lor
the local weekends —just one gay round at the
Waffle Shop, chinning and chewing with the
after-theater crowd, or hunched over a cheap
coke at the Cellar in the middle of all those
people who sprout there in the spring. (A root
in a boot'.) But this weekend we branch out.
This weekend we see Stanford first.
To begin with Saturday around two in the
afternoon, (you can get up by then!) there's a
one way train to Coney Island, which has sud
denly turned up right in the back of Roble.
Step right this way, friends and other suckers,
see the one and only Carnival that was ever
held in the water; see the pretty float going
down for the third time; see the comic divers
diving off their imaginations; see the night
gowns swimming around, some of them with
people in them, and the canoesome twosomes
adorned respectively with two-day beards and
wet pin-curls. (We're dancing, this spring with
our hair in a sling.) See all there is to see; it
sounds good.
From Coney Island it's only a step to Green
wich Village at the Chi O house (doesn't any
body want to go to the Waldorf?), and from
there you can go clear out of this world at the
Lag-Union fawmal in the Women's Gym where
those bulging biceps (sez Our Hasher!) come
from.
This is one time Stanford is worth seeing, all
gussied up with a full moon and a high wind,
and ready for a week's worth of party time.
Have some.
