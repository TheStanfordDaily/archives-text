### "NAILS" BRICKLIN 
After five months at Stanford, wo like to picture
ourselves meeting with a former buddy from the
Third Platoon. We're both veteran soldiers, and a re
union between two fellows who have done a ten
month's hitch in the Army should bring out some
interesting experiences.
The scene is in our luxurious quarters in Enema
Hall. It is Saturday and our room is prepared for
inspection according to the most recent regulations.
We are putting a mirror-like polish on our shoes when
Olin B. Adams barges in. Alter the handshaking, back
slapping, name calling and other signs of mutual satis
faction at the reunion, we settle down to compare notes.
Olie looks at his shoes, so well water-proofed by
dubbing, then he looks at his reflection in the shoes
we are working on, and asks, "How come you polish
your shoes? Doesn't it ever rain out heroV' patiently
we explained to him that on this university post, shoes
must be shined, regardless of California's liquid sun
shine.
Talk about rain brings to mind our days in Northern
Florida where we had gotten used to being soaked
either by the rain or by wading in the swamps. When
we venture a lew remarks about Camp lilanding, O'lie
beams. That is his cue, and he tells us what he is doing
now.
"I was lucky," he starts, "I got off easy because I
was kept as a cadreman. It isn't a bad deal, living and
working with tlie non-coms. In fact" and here he
grows very confidential "the sergeants and corporals
are really okay, when you get to know them."
We admire his bulging muscles and surmise that the
training must be tougher now. We ask him about it,
and we know he's a veteran when he replys, "Oh, it's
plenty rough now with daily marches, but you should
have been here the first cycle."
As we mentioned, it is Saturday, and so all our
drawers are open, with our belongings slacked inside.
Having been brought up on the idea of only a foot
locker in which to store all his things, Olie is intrigued
by our spacious bureaus and closets.
After admiring our luxury for a few minutes, our
buddy starts rummaging through our drawers, and
gains momentum as he goes along. He mumbles to
himself, "They must be here," and "Where could he
hide them?" We ask him what he is looking for and he
is surprised. "Your rifle patches, of course. Where do
you hide them?" Then we tell him the awful truth,
we don't have patches nor rifles either. "That does it,"
he gasps, hardly able to stand after so severe a shock.
We assure him that we do get to sec rifles on Satur
days, and invite him to accompany us during our week
ly drill. Olie knows it must be something special be
cause we are all dressed up in Class "A"' uniforms,
blouse and all. When the band comes, he figures it
must be some holiday, but doesn't know which one.
He can hardly believe it when we tell him Saturday
afternoon drilling is usually done to the accompani
ment of a brass band and in a large stadium.
When drill and pass formation are both over, we
turn to the topic of the evening's entertainment. Olie
says he wants to have a helluva good time. Money i- s
no object. We agree with him and set ofT for Biiyshore
in true ASTP style with two bits between us

plenty rough now with daily marches, but you should
have been here the first cycle."
As we mentioned, it is Saturday, and so all our
drawers are open, with our belongings slacked inside.
Having been brought up on the idea of only a foot
locker in which to store all his things, Olie is intrigued
by our spacious bureaus and closets.
After admiring our luxury for a few minutes, our
buddy starts rummaging through our drawers, and
gains momentum as he goes along. He mumbles to
himself, "They must be here," and "Where could he
hide them?" We ask him what he is looking for and he
is surprised. "Your rifle patches, of course. Where do
you hide them?" Then we tell him the awful truth,
we don't have patches nor rifles either. "That does it,"
he gasps, hardly able to stand after so severe a shock.
We assure him that we do get to sec rifles on Satur
days, and invite him to accompany us during our week
ly drill. Olie knows it must be something special be
cause we are all dressed up in Class "A"' uniforms,
blouse and all. When the band comes, he figures it
must be some holiday, but doesn't know which one.
He can hardly believe it when we tell him Saturday
afternoon drilling is usually done to the accompani
ment of a brass band and in a large stadium.
When drill and pass formation are both over, we
turn to the topic of the evening's entertainment. Olie
says he wants to have a helluva good time. Money i- s
no object. We agree with him and set ofT for Biiyshore
in true ASTP style with two bits between us
After five months at Stanford, wo like to picture
ourselves meeting with a former buddy from the
Third Platoon. We're both veteran soldiers, and a re
union between two fellows who have done a ten
month's hitch in the Army should bring out some
interesting experiences.
The scene is in our luxurious quarters in Enema
Hall. It is Saturday and our room is prepared for
inspection according to the most recent regulations.
We are putting a mirror-like polish on our shoes when
Olin B. Adams barges in. Alter the handshaking, back
slapping, name calling and other signs of mutual satis
faction at the reunion, we settle down to compare notes.
Olie looks at his shoes, so well water-proofed by
dubbing, then he looks at his reflection in the shoes
we are working on, and asks, "How come you polish
your shoes? Doesn't it ever rain out heroV' patiently
we explained to him that on this university post, shoes
must be shined, regardless of California's liquid sun
shine.
Talk about rain brings to mind our days in Northern
Florida where we had gotten used to being soaked
either by the rain or by wading in the swamps. When
we venture a lew remarks about Camp lilanding, O'lie
beams. That is his cue, and he tells us what he is doing
now.
"I was lucky," he starts, "I got off easy because I
was kept as a cadreman. It isn't a bad deal, living and
working with tlie non-coms. In fact" and here he
grows very confidential "the sergeants and corporals
are really okay, when you get to know them."
We admire his bulging muscles and surmise that the
training must be tougher now. We ask him about it,
and we know he's a veteran when he replys, "Oh, it's
plenty rough now with daily marches, but you should
have been here the first cycle."
