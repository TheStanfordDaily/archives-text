### Elliot Epsteen 
The opening stages of (he San
Francisco Conference, though still
negligible in the way of results, and
the smashing Allied drive through
Germany are dominating our atten
tion these days.
But there is a war front just as
important, although the men who
direct the battles are not generals,
and the soldiers in the firing line are
unsung men behind microphones.
We are winning our battle here, and
our progress is a great blow to the
Japanese. This front is the propa
ganda campaign, or war of words.
Moral Base
The most important of all strategic
principles is that, in order to fight a
war, an army needs a secure base,
which is not only a railhead, a wcll
organized rear area, or even this
combined with an industrial setup. It
is all these things, to be sure, but it
is also a moral foundation giving
confidence and a will to fight to both
soldier and civilian.
The totalitarian state tries to cre
ate it by exclusively dominating the
channels of propaganda dissemina
tion. Everything and anything is
broadcast and written each day with
the object of impressing the audi
ence.
But the trouble is that the state
ments sometimes contradict each
other. For example, in the Pacific
war, the Japanese home radio one
day called Manila the "Stalingrad of
the Pacific," and later said it was of
no military importance.
The totalitarian enemy, by his
strict police procedure, thinks that
only few people will catch the incon
sistencies, and will be suppressed if
they publicize them.
However, a new technological ad
vance has changed things. It is a
method by which radio transmitters,
operated in San Francisco, can get
onto the relatively long wave lengths
of the small receivers which the Jap
anese man in the street owns.
Norman Pringle's Work
Norman Pringle, of the Office of
War Information, has written a mim
eographed release to the press, de
scribing the techniques we use in
exploiting this weak point in our
enemy's psychological front.

The first gun that opens fire is a
technique to attract and interest
Japanese listeners. Good dance mu
sic is put on the air. Deanna Durbin
was the most popular movie star to
the average prewar Japanese thea
ter-goer, and briefs about what she
is doing in Hollywood are broadcast.
Many business men have been pro
hibited from studying American pro
i duction techniques, and a financial
| program is put on for them.
Then the critique of Japanese
I propaganda goes on, such as the
i Manila botch, and other of General
Yarnashita's communique inconsis
j tencies.
Enemy Countermeasures
The enemy must realize the effect
! this is having. He tries to jam the
airways with static, but OWI broad
casters use too many wave lengths.
He tries to suppress the ideas that
; are radioed, but history has proven
that no idea can be put down by
force.
And, when our bombers come over,
I our radio men have a field day. Jap
anese stations and static generators
shut down, but our stations still
I transmit, and our words come into
the Japanese air raid shelters to
the frightened Nipponese huddled
around small radios.
Reaching the enemy soldier and
shaking him is somewhat more
difficult. General Von Seeekt, in
j "Thoughts of a Soldier," said that
the spirit of Frederick the Great and
Napoleon went down to the humblest
grenadier. The same should hold
for the fanaticism of the Samurai.
But we do have a broadcast, a mil
itary program, starting with a bugle
call. A strident voice, similar to that
of a Japanese officer, points out army
inefficiency, again uses the high ex
plosive shell of communique incon
sistencies.
Although results might be harder
to get with the Japanese army than
with the Japanese home population,
I hoy will be more devastating in ef
| feet, since they will destroy confi
dence in command, and with it, all
vital discipline.
As Mr. Pringle says, we are win
ning the propaganda war, and it
j seems that our main weapon is the
' mistakes of the enemy in this phase.

anese stations and static generators
shut down, but our stations still
I transmit, and our words come into
the Japanese air raid shelters to
the frightened Nipponese huddled
around small radios.
Reaching the enemy soldier and
shaking him is somewhat more
difficult. General Von Seeekt, in
j "Thoughts of a Soldier," said that
the spirit of Frederick the Great and
Napoleon went down to the humblest
grenadier. The same should hold
for the fanaticism of the Samurai.
But we do have a broadcast, a mil
itary program, starting with a bugle
call. A strident voice, similar to that
of a Japanese officer, points out army
inefficiency, again uses the high ex
plosive shell of communique incon
sistencies.
Although results might be harder
to get with the Japanese army than
with the Japanese home population,
I hoy will be more devastating in ef

As Mr. Pringle says, we are win

' mistakes of the enemy in this phase.
The opening stages of (he San
Francisco Conference, though still
negligible in the way of results, and
the smashing Allied drive through
Germany are dominating our atten
tion these days.
But there is a war front just as
important, although the men who
direct the battles are not generals,
and the soldiers in the firing line are
unsung men behind microphones.
We are winning our battle here, and
our progress is a great blow to the
Japanese. This front is the propa

Moral Base
The most important of all strategic
principles is that, in order to fight a
war, an army needs a secure base,
which is not only a railhead, a wcll
organized rear area, or even this
combined with an industrial setup. It
is all these things, to be sure, but it
is also a moral foundation giving
confidence and a will to fight to both
soldier and civilian.
The totalitarian state tries to cre
ate it by exclusively dominating the
channels of propaganda dissemina
tion. Everything and anything is
broadcast and written each day with
the object of impressing the audi
ence.
But the trouble is that the state
ments sometimes contradict each
other. For example, in the Pacific
war, the Japanese home radio one
day called Manila the "Stalingrad of
the Pacific," and later said it was of
no military importance.
The totalitarian enemy, by his
strict police procedure, thinks that
only few people will catch the incon
sistencies, and will be suppressed if
they publicize them.
However, a new technological ad
vance has changed things. It is a
method by which radio transmitters,
operated in San Francisco, can get
onto the relatively long wave lengths
of the small receivers which the Jap
anese man in the street owns.

Norman Pringle, of the Office of

technique to attract and interest
