The world organization under
blueprint in San Francisco will have
the profoundest task in history, to
keep order in human society and
promote the welfare of the individual
human being whatever his culture,
religion, or color of skin.
Members of this great international
body should be men of extraordinary
ability, imagination, good will, and
courage—to fulfill their titanic obli
gations.
In the truest sense these interna
tional representatives must be politi
cal, economic, and social scientists.
Not only must they have an intimate
knowledge of the nation or segment
of society they represent, but they
must have an intimate knowledge of
every other nation or segment of
society, so that they may strive more
effectively for the welfare of human
ity-
The United Nations have a weighty
obligation, to select men of such ex
alted caliber. On this everything de
pends. The men who will represent
the world will be chosen by many
processes; some men will be elected,
others will be appointed by national
leaders. Obviously not all men chos
en will be perfectly or completely
capable of their duties.
After this great organization has
been established perhaps some uni
form system of selecting individual
men from nations can be established.
Specifically the men should be thor
oughly educated for their task and
then undergo a period of apprentice
ship in the organization. United Na
tions schools might be established in
which qualified representatives of
the nations might be trained in prob
lems of world leadership, and fa
miliarized with all phases of inter
national politics and more important
social and economic complexities.
They should be indoctrinated in
the concept that they represent not
an individual nation's welfare but
the welfare of humanity. After com
pleting a certain period of training
they should be required to pass an
examination and then begin a period
of apprenticeship in the United Na
tions.
They might serve under the retir
ing representatives from this nation

until completely familiar with the
conduct of international affairs. By
this method competent statesmen
capable of world problems would be
I more assured.
Men so educated could be sent to
any part of the earth and they would
know how to deal with problems of
the people they encounter. Misun
derstanding between peoples would
occur less frequently.
To conclude, politicians within in
dividual nations, such as our con
gressmen, governors, and mayors,
might be educated in a similar man
j ner. For example, they should be
I prevented from running for eletcion

until they have had sufficient politi
cal education. This might eliminate
democratic Incompetence.

form system of selecting individual
men from nations can be established.
Specifically the men should be thor
oughly educated for their task and
then undergo a period of apprentice
ship in the organization. United Na
tions schools might be established in
which qualified representatives of
the nations might be trained in prob
lems of world leadership, and fa
miliarized with all phases of inter
national politics and more important
social and economic complexities.
They should be indoctrinated in
the concept that they represent not
an individual nation's welfare but
the welfare of humanity. After com
pleting a certain period of training
they should be required to pass an
examination and then begin a period
of apprenticeship in the United Na
tions.
They might serve under the retir
ing representatives from this nation

until completely familiar with the
conduct of international affairs. By
this method competent statesmen
capable of world problems would be
I more assured.
Men so educated could be sent to
any part of the earth and they would
know how to deal with problems of
the people they encounter. Misun
derstanding between peoples would
occur less frequently.
To conclude, politicians within in
dividual nations, such as our con
gressmen, governors, and mayors,
might be educated in a similar man
j ner. For example, they should be
I prevented from running for eletcion

until they have had sufficient politi
cal education. This might eliminate
democratic Incompetence.
UNCIO Personnel Problem
The world organization under
blueprint in San Francisco will have
the profoundest task in history, to
keep order in human society and
promote the welfare of the individual
human being whatever his culture,
religion, or color of skin.
Members of this great international
body should be men of extraordinary
ability, imagination, good will, and
courage—to fulfill their titanic obli
gations.
In the truest sense these interna
tional representatives must be politi
cal, economic, and social scientists.
Not only must they have an intimate
knowledge of the nation or segment
of society they represent, but they
must have an intimate knowledge of
every other nation or segment of
society, so that they may strive more
effectively for the welfare of human
ity-
The United Nations have a weighty
obligation, to select men of such ex
alted caliber. On this everything de
pends. The men who will represent
the world will be chosen by many
processes; some men will be elected,
others will be appointed by national
leaders. Obviously not all men chos
en will be perfectly or completely
capable of their duties.
