### BOB GILKEY 
The Monroe Boozers removed an
other tough obstacle on their path
to the league title by defeating the
Med Schol 3-1. Ed Luce's dramatic
last-inning homer provided the mar
gin of victory.
With the score knotted at 1-1 in
the last of the seventh, Joe Sher,
who pitched a beautiful game for his
fifth straight triumph, beat out a
bunt. Luce, who has been the big
gun in the Monroe slugging attack

this year, whacked his mighty four
master to l ight center. The drive es
caped the Med School center-fielder,
who barely reached it with his
gloved hand.
The victory placed Monroe far
ahead with five wins and no losses
and removed their last serious com
petition. The Med School was pre
viously unbeaten and had an upset
win over Phi Psi to its credit.
The Phi Psi's, after two successive
losses, came back to normal again
by decisively walloping the Legal

Eagles, 15-4. Even without the serv
ices of ace pitcher Luke Pitts, the
Phi Psi's hopelessly outclassed the
Eagles, who moved back into a tie
with Phi Psi, both teams having
three victories and two defeats.
Scoring nine runs in the fifth in
ning, Buchanan came from behind to
topple Arguello, 11-6. The score was
(5-2 in favor of Arguello when the
Bearcats opened up with their scor
ing barrage. The triumph moved
Buchanan into second place with a
3-1 record.
In the fourth Softball league game,
the Tyler Hilltoppers entered the
victory column for the first time by
beating the Flacs, 13-5), in a five-in
ning slugfest. The Hilltoppers
pounded over five markers in the
first and six more in the third to
establish a safe lead. Joe Pickering,
Tyler first baseman, paced the hit
lers with two triples and a walk.
