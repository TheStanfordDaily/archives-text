# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
With the major leagues largely idle
as the result of inclement weather
this week, the biggest news in base
ball is the appointment of Senator
"Happy" Chandler of Kentucky to
fill the position of high commissioner
of baseball vacated by the death of
Kenesaw Mountain Landis four
months ago. The Congressman, with
a $50,000 a year contract staring him
in the face, announced his immediate
decision that keeping baseball in
line is now more of a national prob
lem than the war, on Wednesday. He
plans to assume his new duties as
soon as he can get out of his now
unimportant Senate position.
Tough Role
He takes on his shoulders one of
the most difficult peacetime jobs in
the nation, a job requiring prompt
decision and decisive action. Wheth
er he will be able to match the as
sertive personality of his predecessor
only time can tell. That Chandler
himself is the assertive type is not a
point of speculation. We seem to re
member one time in the far distant
past when Winston Churchill was
held up a whole day in addressing
the joint houses of Congress because
Chandler was carrying on an An
glophobic filibuster on the Senate
floor and under the Constitution
there was no way to get rid of him.
American League
The American League, while fail
ing to produce the anticipated re
sults, has come through with some
good ball games and taken some
unexpected turns. Leading the field
are the Chicago White Sox, who have
yet to taste defeat. The Yanks and
the Tigers have come through in ex
pected Style, but cannot quite match
Jimmy Dykes' boys as yet. The
Ump's Browns seem to have let him
down. It is his personal opinion that
while they have everything they had
last year on paper, they seem to have
lost that imponderable factor that
never quite shows up in the score
books: the ability to come through in
the clutches—you might almost call

it the old "college try." It was a de
ciding factor in their last year's pen- !
nant victory.
The National League finds the
Giants atop the heap with the Chi
cago outfit hot on their tails. The
Cards are at present in third, but

give 'em time. They'll get there all
right.
A( Home
Here at home Portland continues
on its merry way with virtually no
opposition except from Bill Skiff's
amazing Rainiers. The first series
between these two powerhouses
should be a lulu. San Diego has
proved unexpectedly strong, and is

opposing Oakland as the third posi
tion contender. Lefty O'Doul is hav
ing trouble finding a hurler who can
last more than seven innings, and
his Seals never seem quite to reach
the first division. Two feeble entries
from Los Angles County repose at
th bottom of the ladder.

floor and under the Constitution
there was no way to get rid of him.
American League
The American League, while fail
ing to produce the anticipated re
sults, has come through with some
good ball games and taken some
unexpected turns. Leading the field
are the Chicago White Sox, who have
yet to taste defeat. The Yanks and
the Tigers have come through in ex
pected Style, but cannot quite match
Jimmy Dykes' boys as yet. The
Ump's Browns seem to have let him
down. It is his personal opinion that
while they have everything they had
last year on paper, they seem to have
lost that imponderable factor that
never quite shows up in the score
books: the ability to come through in
the clutches—you might almost call

it the old "college try." It was a de
ciding factor in their last year's pen- !
nant victory.
The National League finds the
Giants atop the heap with the Chi
cago outfit hot on their tails. The
Cards are at present in third, but

give 'em time. They'll get there all
right.
A( Home
Here at home Portland continues
on its merry way with virtually no
opposition except from Bill Skiff's
amazing Rainiers. The first series
between these two powerhouses
should be a lulu. San Diego has
proved unexpectedly strong, and is

opposing Oakland as the third posi
tion contender. Lefty O'Doul is hav
ing trouble finding a hurler who can
last more than seven innings, and
his Seals never seem quite to reach
the first division. Two feeble entries
from Los Angles County repose at
th bottom of the ladder.
With the major leagues largely idle
as the result of inclement weather
this week, the biggest news in base
ball is the appointment of Senator
"Happy" Chandler of Kentucky to
fill the position of high commissioner
of baseball vacated by the death of
Kenesaw Mountain Landis four
months ago. The Congressman, with
a $50,000 a year contract staring him
in the face, announced his immediate
decision that keeping baseball in
line is now more of a national prob
lem than the war, on Wednesday. He
plans to assume his new duties as
soon as he can get out of his now
unimportant Senate position.
Tough Role
He takes on his shoulders one of
the most difficult peacetime jobs in
the nation, a job requiring prompt
decision and decisive action. Wheth
er he will be able to match the as
sertive personality of his predecessor
only time can tell. That Chandler
himself is the assertive type is not a
point of speculation. We seem to re
member one time in the far distant
past when Winston Churchill was
held up a whole day in addressing
the joint houses of Congress because
Chandler was carrying on an An
glophobic filibuster on the Senate
floor and under the Constitution
there was no way to get rid of him.
