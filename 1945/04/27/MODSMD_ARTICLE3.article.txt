## 
### 
Pastel - colored streamers, park
benches, lattice work, and crepe
paper spring flowers and butterfliesâ€”
all will be features of the Lagunita-
Union Unit Spring Fantasy semi
formal which will begin tomorrow
night at 8:30 in the women's gym to
the music of Beit Whiting and his
orchestra.
Spring fever will really take shape
when Mr. Whiting and his ten-piece
orchestra play the soft, dreamy music
they have promised, and Stanford
roughs and co-ecLs dance around the
maypole which will be centered in
the room.
Sonia Shaw, NBC vocalist, will
sing with the band. Mr. Whiting
does his own arranging and has a
special arrangement of "Stanford in
Spring" to play. He also promises to
play waltzes and such favorites as
"Maytime."
According to Decorations Chair
man Carol Torreson, the band stand
will be set of! by pillars to give the
room a concert-in-the-park look.
Huge crepe paper butterflies will be
pcrched on bouquets of pastel-col
ored crepe paper flowers throughout
th room. The basketball baskets will
be filled with greens and flowers.
The maypole and streamers, all in
spring colors, will bring the "Fan
tasy" to life. Park benches will be
in the room both for convenience and
atmosphere.
After the dance, all hungry Stan
fordites will be served punch, coflce,
little sandwiches, and small cakes.
Girls are urged to leave their coals
in their gym lockers to avoid the
check-room confusion.
