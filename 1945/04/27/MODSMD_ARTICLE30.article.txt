If you liked the book, ' Song of
Bernadette," you'll probably weep
through a month's supply of Kleenex
at the movie . On the other hand, if
you couldn't force yourself through
several hundred of Franz Werfel's
sticky pages of visions, saints, and
martyrs, you'll find the movie even
worse.
Considering the amount of public
ity that the picture has been given,
the cast was quite poor. Jennifer
Jones gave a marvelous portrayal of
neurotic Bernadette Soubirous up
until the time she was taken to the
nunnery. From then on, her imma
turity and innocence didn't seem
natural. Her face was too sweet and
fresh to convey any idea of suffering
toward the end of the movie, and she
did a sloppy job of dying.

With the exception of Mania Sou
birous and the skeptical nun, most
of the supporting cast was melodra
matic. The majority of them talked
with no trace of an accent, but oc
casionally a thick French accent
would creep into the atmosphere de
partment.
Probably the weakest paoint was
the showing of Bernadette's vision.
Instead of letting the movie-goer
presume from Bernadette's expres
sion that the vision had returned,
they produced a slight tingling sound
and a flood of light, with a character
in the midst of it that looked just
about as real as a page from a re
ligious calendar.
Outside of this, there wasn't much
wrong with the movie—except that
it lasted two and one-half hours.—
