MEMORIAL OPERA HOUSE,
SAN FRANCISCO, April 26 (UP).—
Russia made plain yesterday that she
would stand by her demand for three
votes for the world security organi
•.■nti'in, and that Poland herself must
have a voice in the Big Three discus
sion over the deadlocked Polish
problem.
The views were put forth by For
eign Commissar Molotov in a crowd
er press conference before the first
plenary session of the San Francisco
Conference which Molotov also ad
dressed. The Soviet Commissar did
not mention Poland in his address to
security conferees on the three-vote
issue in any formal manner.
Molotov's plenary session address
emphasized that the Conference was
to demonstrate the ability of the
United Nations to work together to
guarantee the peace and welfai'e in
combining the war and the defeat
of German aggressors. He made no
mention of Japan but specified China
as the Asiatic power that must join
with the Big Three and France in
big power elaboration to make the
new organization effective.
Molotov emphasized that he was
very anxious that Poland be repre
sented at the United Nations assem
bly. After questioning he said no
solution of the Polish issue could be
made without the participation of
the Poles themselves. He did not
specify the identity of the Poles, but
there was no doubt that the refer

ence was to the provisional Warsaw
regime.
The plenary session was addressed
by Secretary of State Edward R.
Stettinius, and Foreign Secretaries
Anthony Eden, T. V. Soong and
Molotov. Both Stettinius and Eden
told delegates not to expect perfec
tion in the deliberation. Eden urged
them to concentrate on a suitable
charter for organization, leaving de
tails to be filled in later if necessary.
