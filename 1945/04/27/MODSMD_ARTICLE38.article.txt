## 
### 
Eleven new members of lota Sig
ma Pi, women's national chemical
fraternity, were initiated last night
at a supper held by the fraternity at
the home of Mrs. Jacqueline Ogg.
The new members are: Madeline
Brill, Jacqueline Canfield, Karleen
Cooper, Vivian Fleming, Mrs. Nydia
Goetz, Nancy Grcenbaum, Elizabeth
Ketcham, Janet Settle, Ann Stuart,
Elizabeth Tarr, and Alice Tuttle.
lota Sigma Pi is an honorary fra
ternity, with its members elected on
the basis of their scholarship in
chemistry courses. The number of
initiates this year is far above the
usual number, reflecting the in
creased wartime interest of women
in chemistry and related fields.
