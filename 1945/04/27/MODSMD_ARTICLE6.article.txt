# Town Meeting Talks Peace
## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
On the second day of the San
Francisco Confcrcncc, America's
Town Meeting of the Air assembled
Senator Tom Connally, Commander
Harold Stassen, Raymond Swing,
H. V. Kaltcnborn, William L. Shirer,
Joseph C. Grew from Washington,
D.C., and 10,000 San Francisco spec
tators to discuss "Can We Build a
Lasting Peace Now?"
The crowds were in a town meet
ing mood, interest whetted by what
Joseph C. Grew termed the "town
meeting of the world." Half an hour
before the scheduled introduction,
people were crowded in the aisles
and bginning to frame questions an
hour in advance.
As an initial introduction to di
plomacy, the actual broadcast was
delayed 15 minutes by a speech from
Anthony Eden, and it was announced
that Stassen, Connally, and Grew
could not, for "diplomatic reasons,"
be questioned. One individualist un
der the balcony objected, but the
other 9,999 in the audience laughed
him to his scat.
Middle of Road
Grew, Stassen and Connally spoke
tactfully %n the middle-of-the-road
policy, to be expected in their offi
cial position. All three agreed, in
slightly different terms, with Presi
dent Truman's plea that "might
should be right and right should be
might." They developed the hope
that San Francisco would be a con
tinuation and evolution of Dumbar
ton Oaks with the vitality of active
desire for peace backing the organi
zation at work.
It was Raymond Swing and H. V.
Kaltcnborn, however, who pul the
vitality in the Town Meeting of the
Air. Swing opened with the an
nouncement. that there would be two
great powers after the war â€” the
United tSates and Russia. Kaltcn
born objected to the exclusion of
Great Britain. Swing again led off
with the contention that the main
task to be accomplished in the San
Francisco Conference was a Russo-
U.S. alliance in spirit, if not in fact.
Newsman Kaltcnborn felt that the
world is past the period of alliances,
and that drafting of a San Francisco
charter is a step forward for a peace
in which the whole world will have
a part.
Timely Warning
Kaltcnborn went on to warn that
we could not expect too much sacri
fice from individual nations. A peace
plan of sacrifice, he summarized,
would be an evolution only begin
ning with the San Francisco charter.
Both Swing and Kaltcnborn agreed
that peace would have to be en
forced, and that a mere illegalizing
of war would be inadequate.

For the men, long, narrow trouser
legs and old-fashioned straw hats
were extremely popular. Men wore
high, uncomfortable collars which
often did not match their shirts.
Jack Worthing (William Melton),
a man about town and country, is
quite conservative in his dress. In
one scene he has to wear mourning
clothes. The committee has made
him a mourning handkerchief and a
black band to wear around his sleeve.
Silk and Sideburns
Johnny High, who plays the man
about town Algernon, is much less
conservative. One of his shirts is of
striped silk. He is also growing side
burns for the play.
Costumers have made a clerical
vest and plain frock coat for the Rev.
Chasuble (Martin Naldcr).
Costume Committee consists of:
Mary Higgins, Muriel Hopkins, and
Candy Taylor.
