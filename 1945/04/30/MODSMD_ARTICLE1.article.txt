# CONFERENCE
## False Armistice Cheered; Molotov Calm at Report 
### TED DRENTON 
Conference excitement pervaded
San Francisco Saturday afternoon as
delegates from the various United
Nations hurried from hotels to the
Opera House. To come in the im
mediate Conference area passes had
to be shown. Inside the Veterans'
building crowds milled around the
information desks and the press bu
reaus.
Lines of nevrous people waited in
front of the ticket both in the Op
era House, where tickets were free
ly given away to those willing to ac
cept standing room.
War Rumors
All seats were filled and many
stood leaning over the balconies,
staring at the group of reporters
with flash cameras below the speak
er's platform. In the lower wings
hundreds of news and camera men
leaned over the rails chatting and
staring down at the dignitaries. Sev
eral people whispered that the end
of the war would be announced from
the Conference. Floodlights were
turned on lighting the stage with
brilliant white light. Four gold pil
lars representing the Four Freedoms
and fastened together with chains,
stood behind the speaker's platform.
Between the pillars were flags of
the United Nations set against a blue
curtain. On the blue carpet in front
of the stage were four gold silk
chairs and a platform with five mic
rophones.
Molotov Presides
Molotov and three other officials
entered from behind the blue curtain
but unfortunately Anthony Eden and
Stettinius were not present. Every
one stood and clapped; then Molotov
began to address the audience in
Russian, thanking the United Nations
for accepting him as one of the chair
men of the Conference. After he
spoke an interpreter presented his
statement in English. Molotov is a
small, broad-faced, intelligent-fea
tured man of few smiles and great
dignity.
He introduced the ambassador
from San Salvador, speaking in Rus
sian. after which the interpreter re
peated the statement in English. Next
were the ambassadors from Greece

and the Philippines, who spoke of the
terrible suffering their countries had
undergone and the urgent need for a
world organization to promote justice
and equality of opportunity for all
nations .
Philippine Ambassador
The Philippines ambassador was a
particularly brilliant and moving or
ator whose earnestness of expression
moved everyone in the audience.
"I have seen the bones of men,
women, and children;" he said. "Civ
ilization cannot outlast another war,
hence we must succeed here."
The Uruguayan minister spoke in
Spanish and was translated by an
interpreter. Many began to leave at
this period and those standing began
to fill the empty seats. Molotov sat
with folded hands, occasionally
drinking a glass of water.
Headlines Flashed
Suddenly a delegate ran down the
aisle holding a paper with the start
ling five-inch red heading, "Nazis
Quit." Reporters sprang from the
first row of seats, gathered around
the delegate, who held the paper high
so everyone might see, and their
flashlight cameras blinked.
The audience rose to their seats
and applauded thunderously, while
a few delegates began running up
and down indiscriminately shaking
hands with fellow delegates.
Molotov Interrupted
For a moment the speaker was
interrupted as the delegate dashed
on the stage handing Molotov the
momentous paper. The interpreters
excited spoke to him; however he
did not seem much disturbed and
motioned for order; the speech con
tinued.'
During this time people shuffled
impatiently and whispered that the
momentous announcement should be
made at the end of the speech; how
ever, remarkably, no such thing oc
curred.
Molotov simply adjourned the
meeting and the crowds poured out
in great disappointment and excite
ment. From here the news was
spread over the nation and the world
but of course was later disproved.
Millions were disappointed, though
it was a great thrill, nevertheless.
