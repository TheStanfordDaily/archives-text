There's a thrill running the course of the Campus' spinal
column these days, and the traditional unruffled air of the college
countenance is having a hard fight in the face of the historical
events and personages that are appearing around us every day.
Already we have shown our campus to people from several
countries, and are looking forward to having many more here to
see the Farm.
As more teas, tours, and receptions appear on the campus cal
endar, we suppose, we shall get braver about seeing these peo
ple. The first hysteria of guessing whether our guests speak
English or not, will be overcome, to some extent.
The strain of these visits among strangejrs, and especially
among college youth (picture what our own predicament would
be in another country) must certainly be kept in mind.
The brashness of speaking German to the Russians, or being
flip about the dearly held boundaries of some small country, con
sidering how our own American sense of humor excuses ig
norance, which is rudeness to other people, will probably only be
overcome by considerable effort on our part. We must con
sciuosly make this effort if we are to fairly represent oru country
to these esteemed guests.
The social committee of the A.S.S.U. is currently working on
plans by which students may entertain people from the con
ference; let's be determined to make their stay a treat for them,
and it will probably mean more pleasure for ourselves.
