Now we come to Con Home Week, that expansive time of year
at which Stanford students are permitted, not to say urged (not
to say beaten over the head), to feel pleased with themselves at
minimum prices. Parting with a favorite stuffed rabbit, eating
strawberries in Union Court and candied applies at the Soph Car
nival, and investing in brand-new denims for the weed-pulling
party at the Con Home are, after all, not so hard to take, and not
so hard to give.
All the local spectators have their chance to become, for a
six-day run, star performers in a sure-fire show, with a gallery
?f wonderful young 'uns who would rather look at the neigh
boring undergraduates in the midst of their annual experiment
vith manual labor than fourteen reels of Gene Autry. (And who
vouldn't?)
The entertainment is non-stop and commences this evening,
it vhich time the cream of the campus pretty-please talent will
■»pen the doors to the good people of Paly. (We're coming, we're
coining, our gay little band!) And tomorrow, as we make the
ounds of our favorite fag-time spots, we are likely to encounter
he first in a series of good-natured bites with free advertising
or each and every bitee.
Come to the party.
