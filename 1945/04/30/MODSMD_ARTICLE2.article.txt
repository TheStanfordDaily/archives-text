# V-E DAY
## Victory Program Released; Special Exercises in Chapel 
### 
Stanford will hold special V-E Day
exercises in Inner Quad and Memor
ial Church immediately upon re
ceipt of official proclamation of the
end of the war in Europe, it has
been announced by Professor Geoi'ge
E. Osborne, chairman of the V-E
Day Committee.
Because of the nature of V-E Day,
Professor Osborne said the commit
tee felt it inadvisable to declare a
special University holiday. Accord
ingly classes will be dismissed only
for the actual period of the exercises
and will be resumed at the beginning
of the next regular class hour.
The V-E Day program will be di
vided into two parts: a spontaneous
celebration for "letting off steam,"
and a chapel service for thanksgiving
and re-devotion to the unfinished
task which lies ahead.
If the V-E Day announcement
conies between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
on a day when the University is
in full session, the campus will he
notified by a signal consisting of
three series of four medium blasts
of the Firehouse and Powerhouse
whistles. All classes (including
Army classes) will dismiss and of
fices will close, in order that stu
dents, faculty and staff members
may assemble immediately in front
of Memorial Church.
Band music, songs, and yells will
make up the first part of the V-E

Day program. The Stanford band
will be on hand to play; Bill Shep
herd will lead the singing, and Rie
Supple will double as both yell lead
er and master of ceremonies.
The second phase, the service
within the Church, has been built
around three thoughts, Professor Os
borne said: First, the memory of
the men who have been sacrificed to
achieve V-E; second, the realization
that the job of war is not finished;
third, the fact that the great and
difficult problems of the peace lie
ahead.
Although more detailed plans of
the chapel service will be announced
shortly, it will consist of singing by
the student choir, call to worship,
congregational singing, a brief ad
dress by President Donald B. Tres
idder or his representative, and pray
er followed by a moment of silence.
There will be no official signal
sounded on campus if the V-E Day
announcement comes during a Sat
urday afternoon, on a Sunday, or
awter 5 p.m. on week days. The
service planned for Memorial
Church will be held at 11 a.m. on
the next regular class day fol

make up the first part of the V-E

Day program. The Stanford band
will be on hand to play; Bill Shep
herd will lead the singing, and Rie
Supple will double as both yell lead
er and master of ceremonies.
The second phase, the service
within the Church, has been built
around three thoughts, Professor Os
borne said: First, the memory of
the men who have been sacrificed to
achieve V-E; second, the realization
that the job of war is not finished;
third, the fact that the great and
difficult problems of the peace lie
ahead.
Although more detailed plans of
the chapel service will be announced
shortly, it will consist of singing by
the student choir, call to worship,
congregational singing, a brief ad
dress by President Donald B. Tres
idder or his representative, and pray
er followed by a moment of silence.

Stanford will hold special V-E Day
exercises in Inner Quad and Memor
ial Church immediately upon re
ceipt of official proclamation of the
end of the war in Europe, it has
been announced by Professor Geoi'ge
E. Osborne, chairman of the V-E
Day Committee.
Because of the nature of V-E Day,
Professor Osborne said the commit
tee felt it inadvisable to declare a
special University holiday. Accord
ingly classes will be dismissed only
for the actual period of the exercises
and will be resumed at the beginning
of the next regular class hour.
The V-E Day program will be di
vided into two parts: a spontaneous
celebration for "letting off steam,"
and a chapel service for thanksgiving
and re-devotion to the unfinished
task which lies ahead.
If the V-E Day announcement
conies between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
on a day when the University is
in full session, the campus will he
notified by a signal consisting of
three series of four medium blasts
of the Firehouse and Powerhouse
whistles. All classes (including
Army classes) will dismiss and of
fices will close, in order that stu
dents, faculty and staff members
may assemble immediately in front
of Memorial Church.
