# Mussolini Executed
## 
### 
MILAN, April 29 (UP). â€” Italian
patriots executed Benito Mussolini
yesterday, and today a howling mob
is kicking and spitting at the re
mains lying in the center of the city
where Italian Fascism was born.
Mussolini's face has a disdainful
snarl. He died shouting "No, no" to
the firing squad which took his life
and that of his mistress at Dongo in
Lake Zono at 4:0.
The body was taken by truck to
Milan and dumped in the city hall.
Along with Mussolini the patriots
killed 16 other Fascists, many of
them members of his family.


. , . BENITO MUSSOLINI
