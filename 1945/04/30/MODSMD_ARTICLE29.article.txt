# Sponsor Choosing Committee Meets
## 
### 
Want to be a sponsor? If so, and
if you are at least of first quarter
junior standing and have a C aver
age, preferably better, you may try
out. Come for an interview with
the Sponsor Choosing Committee to
day or tomorrow.
The committee will meet today and
tomorrow from 2 to 5 p.m. and to
morrow night from 7 to 8 p.m. in the
Excom room, according to Lorrain
Streblow, chairman.
Sponsors chosen will be sponsors
of freshmen women and may serve
during summer and fall quarters or
fall and winter quarters.
Girls interested both in running in
the all-campus election, May 16. and
in applying for sponsorship positions
are urged to try out before the com
mittee, as their status as a sponsor
will not be affected by their partici
pation in the elections. Appointments
will not be disclosed until after the
election.
Members of the committee are:
Yvonne Guilbert, Winifred Lamm, Jo
Davis, Lorraine Harband, B. J. Mil
ler, Patty Patten, Marylou McClure,
and Pam Strathairn.
