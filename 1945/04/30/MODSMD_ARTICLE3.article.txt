While Stanford students, including
earnest Daily reporters, were flock

Conference greats and near-greats,
Russian, Belgian, and French officials

In an unofficial visit, members of
the USSR's delegation, including
Premier Molotov, swept up Palm

three limousines flanked by U. S.
Army cars. The delegation refused
formal guidance, strolled about, and
then left once again down Palm
Drive.
Kaltenborn Here
PI. V. Kaltenborn ran into Daily
reporters Saturday morning after a
tour of the Hoover Library and a
close inspection of its newspaper
files. Mr. Kaltenborn, with Mrs.
Kaltenborn, expressed his pleasure
with Stanford, thought it "charm
ing." They said, "We wish our grand
children might go here to school."

the first announcement of the "un

night, Dr. Tresidder appeared in the
