The Palo Alto Independents will j
get their real test of strength when
they tackle the Fleet City Blue
jackets next Friday on the Paly High
diamond. Fleet City has a talented
roster which includes Harvey Storey,
former San Francisco Seals and Chi
cago Cubs player, and Eddie Fernan
dez.
With their batting prowess as yet
to stand up against professional
pitching, the "Independents" are
pinning their hopes on the slants
of "Doc" Mason, who really pitched ;
a sensational game last Wednesday.
Mason, who was the hurler tor the
last official Stanford squad, pos
sesses all the poise of a big league
chucker and much of the talent to
go with it.
P.A.I, also has a game scheduled
for next Thursday, a return match
with Lincoln High of San Jose. In
order to save Mason for the Fleet
City contest, the Independents are
using Rosburg against Lincoln. Al
though Rosburg doesn't have the ter
riffic speed of Mason, he has a baf- !
fling dehvery and a repertoh'e of j
curves and hooks that will keep the !
opponents guessing. Yesterday's tri
umph over Lincoln may not sound
impressive, but it is noteworthy that !
the San Jose outfit has only lost !
three games, two close ones to San j
Jose State and the loss to the Inde- |
pendents.
For all you Stanfordites that have !
been waiting to find an outlet for I
that spirit that you haven't had a
chance to express, here is your
chance. The Palo Alto Independent
team is an outfit that is composed of
Stanford students, students that
would probably be playing for an j
"Indian" nine if they had a chance, j
Ability and talent are not the only
necessities for a successful team.
Support and pronounced interest on ;
the part of the students is a very j
important factor in determining the
outcome of any game.
