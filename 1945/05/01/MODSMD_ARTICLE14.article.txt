# DATE WITH A TOY GIRAFFE
## 
### 
CON HOME DRIVE
Some little guy's playing around with his
funny old toy giraffe out at the Con Home today,
and although he doesn't guite understand the
workings of society and the concessions it
makes to "little guys," he's part of something
big.
He's two dollars and seventy-five cents worth
of boy, when it comes to adding up the figures
that mean food, shelter, and clothing every day;
and he's part of a charity movement that's big
at Stanford because it's all our own —the annual
Stanford Convalescent Home Drive.
To keep us from getting tied up in small
knots over the time-consuming guestion ot
"us" and our comtort, we have that little guy
out there at the Con Home and his 60 junior
size pals to think about. This week we can
concentrate on them; we can be in on the
various schemes that the drive chairmen have
plotted out to donate in the easy way to those
who need its material support.
Today we'll have a Strawberry Brunch, and
it's T-Day, when all Farm students buy a Con
Home tag. Tomorrow we'll hit for the Home and
hoe a fine row for the traditional Labor Day.
Thursday each tournament will be played off
between Farm students who contributed a little
extra to the drive as an entry fee, and Friday
we'll Soph-Carnival it until we've piled up lots
of proceeds to be contributed to the Home.
A Con Home report tells us this:
"The Home was organized in 1919 and was in
corporated on June 23, 1924 ... the purpose of
the organization is to provide nursing care, med
ical services, and instruction for convalescent
children."
To our little guy out at the Home we say,
"Okay, fella, we'll be on your side. Sock that
knobby old toy giraffe for us and tell him we'll
be there tomorrow!"—N. S.
