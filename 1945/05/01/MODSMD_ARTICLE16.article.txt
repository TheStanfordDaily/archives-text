from getting anywhere," said a small voice behind Al
ice," but an irritable nature and a bad temper have
handicapped even more." Alice paddled herself around
until she could see where the voice was coming from.
It was a mouse, a moderately small mouse-colored
mouse about Alice's size.
"But what am I to do!" exclaimed Alice in exaspera
tion, "I am getting very unhappy and cold and lonely,
and I haven't the vaguest idea where I am going."
"Who does know where they're going?" reflected
the mouse in a very philosophical tone, as he blew
hubbies through his whiskers. ''But even if you are
unhappy, there is no use in being nasty and irritable
about it."
"I can't help being irritable, I'm afraid," said Alice
respectfully, "and I'm very sorry to be nasty, but I'm
not comfortable inside. It's all muddled and confused
inside; things are all tangled up."
"That's because yo"u were trying to figure out where
you were going, and because you were worrying
whether you would get there or not," replied the mouse
"and that makes life much too complex. Best put off
worrying about such ideas until you're much much
older."
■'But then," said Alice, in a voice that was still q
little irritable, "I'm liable to have made a great many
— mistakes because I had no idea where I was going."
"It is far far better," said the mouse, swimming
along briskly, "to make a great many mistakes and
be pleasant, than it is to be correct in your purposes,
but nasty in your disposition."
"I wish," said Alice, as she tried to keep up with the
mouse, "you'd stop trying to be so clever and say some
thing intelligent and practical."
The mouse blew the foam off the end of his nose, and
practiced Immelman turns between the lily fronds.
Then he disappeared from sight for a minute, and re
appeared suddenly, swimming along with Alice as
though nothing had happened.
"After mature reflection," he said with a frown, "I
find that the best way to get rid of irritableness is by
ceasing to be irritable. Like me. I'm cold and I'm lost;
nevertheless I remain pleasant and cheerful."
"But you're a mouse," said Alice, splashing along
beside him, "and mouses are different inside."
"Hum," said the mouse to himself in an extremely in
terested voice, "that's absolutely true. Mouses are
very comfortable inside, very very comfortable in
deed." And he stopped swimming, quite overcome by
the idea; he drifted along in the water, occasionally
giving a faint swish with his tail or a dabbling sort of
paddle with his right foreleg to avoid the larger pieces
of driftwood.
"Oh dear!" cried Alice as she paddled after him, "I
wish that you would say something profound or
penetrating that would explain me to myself."
But the mouse went on drifting and drifting; and
when Alice last saw him he was still saying over and
over to himself, "How very, very true, mouses are com
fortable inside; very, very comfortable."
