### BY TED DRENTON 
Conference color—l saw Foreign Commissar Mo
lotov on the campus Saturday followed by member's
of the Soviet delegation. Russian newsmen, and secret
service men. Fifteen or so cars were gathered on Palm
Drive, where the delegation halted to stroll about the
campus, while nearby were gathered a few students
staring with fascination upon the impressive group.
I tried to break through the cordon of secret service
men to speak with Molotov but was pushed away. None
of the newsmen seemed to understand English, al
though one delegate in the rear of the party was able
to explain a portion of Palm Drive and then stepped
back into their official car and sped away. He did
seem quite interested in the University as he spoke
with great admiration to the men around him. He was
dressed in a grey suit and hat. While the men spoke
to him he smiled and nodded his head with interest. I
did understand them say "Palo Alto" and "University
of Stanford" just as they stepped into their cars.
As he entered his car I tried to get close to him but
again was held away by the secret service men. In the
party was a Russian admiral in a beautiful blue uni
form, gold braid and black boots.
Cameramen stood on the running boards of the car«
constantly snapping pictures.
In San Francisco I saw crowds gathered around and
in the major hotels, everyone staring with curiosity at
entering and departing diplomats. Autograph seekers
were hunting delegates and eagerly demanding signa
tures. Several Russian generals strolled out of the
Hotel St. Francis dressed in boots, gold braid, and
with red stars on their chests.
In the Hotel Mark Hopkins I encountered two Chi
nese delegates who had just been upstairs with T. V.
Soong. They commented in excellent English that San
Francisco was a very beautiful city, and then asked
how I liked their diplomatic invasion.
They said there was no doubt that the Conference
would be successful and that even if Germany surren
ders the delegates would not depart for home. One of
them had visited Stanford five years ago, and exclaimed
that it is a very wonderful school.
In the Hotel St. Francis I encountered the Minister
from Irrq who commented that the Conference not only
would succeed but must succeed. He stated that the
Germans had made no trouble in his country during the
war, but they had caused considerable uproar in Iran
and neighboring countries.
Iraq has potentalities of becoming a great country,
having all the resources and historic background nec
essary for this position. He thought that Iraq dates are
far superior to California dates.

dressed in a grey suit and hat. While the men spoke
to him he smiled and nodded his head with interest. I
did understand them say "Palo Alto" and "University
of Stanford" just as they stepped into their cars.
As he entered his car I tried to get close to him but
again was held away by the secret service men. In the
party was a Russian admiral in a beautiful blue uni
form, gold braid and black boots.
Cameramen stood on the running boards of the car«
constantly snapping pictures.
In San Francisco I saw crowds gathered around and
in the major hotels, everyone staring with curiosity at
entering and departing diplomats. Autograph seekers
were hunting delegates and eagerly demanding signa
tures. Several Russian generals strolled out of the
Hotel St. Francis dressed in boots, gold braid, and
with red stars on their chests.
In the Hotel Mark Hopkins I encountered two Chi
nese delegates who had just been upstairs with T. V.
Soong. They commented in excellent English that San
Francisco was a very beautiful city, and then asked
how I liked their diplomatic invasion.
They said there was no doubt that the Conference
would be successful and that even if Germany surren
ders the delegates would not depart for home. One of
them had visited Stanford five years ago, and exclaimed
that it is a very wonderful school.
In the Hotel St. Francis I encountered the Minister
from Irrq who commented that the Conference not only
would succeed but must succeed. He stated that the
Germans had made no trouble in his country during the
war, but they had caused considerable uproar in Iran
and neighboring countries.
Iraq has potentalities of becoming a great country,
having all the resources and historic background nec
essary for this position. He thought that Iraq dates are
far superior to California dates.
Conference color—l saw Foreign Commissar Mo
lotov on the campus Saturday followed by member's
of the Soviet delegation. Russian newsmen, and secret
service men. Fifteen or so cars were gathered on Palm
Drive, where the delegation halted to stroll about the
campus, while nearby were gathered a few students
staring with fascination upon the impressive group.
I tried to break through the cordon of secret service
men to speak with Molotov but was pushed away. None
of the newsmen seemed to understand English, al
though one delegate in the rear of the party was able
to explain a portion of Palm Drive and then stepped
back into their official car and sped away. He did
seem quite interested in the University as he spoke
with great admiration to the men around him. He was
dressed in a grey suit and hat. While the men spoke
to him he smiled and nodded his head with interest. I
did understand them say "Palo Alto" and "University
