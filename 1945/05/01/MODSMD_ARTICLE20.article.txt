### 
The following' topics were dis
cussed at yesterday's meeting of
Women's Conference:
1. Row Exconi
2. Saturday night closing hours

4. Nominating Committee
5. "Back to the Farm" proceeds
Eleanor Marks, vice-chairman of
Women's Conference, reported to
Conference yesterday that the nine
Row houses will be organized into a
which will meet once a month
and will be subject to special meet
ings to solve immediate problems, if
the president feels it necessary to
call them.
This was decided last week when
representatives of each of the Row
houses met with Miss Marks. It was
thought that a Row Excom would
make it easier to get in touch with
the houses and would be especially
helpful for such occasions as the
social program of the Housing Com
mittee.
Elect President
The Excom will be made up of the
vice-presidents of each of the nine
houses. Ann Goodwin, vice-presi
dent of Cubberley, will call a spe
cial meeting this week so that a
president can be chosen.
House presidents announced
that the girls in their houses were
very much in favor of keeping
their houses open until 1:30 on
Saturday nights, so there would be
some place to go after 12. More
action will be takjm on this before
Conference meets again.
Campus Culturals
A plan was suggested whereby all
girls would be able to have one or
two campus culturals per quarter to
use when going to plays on campus.
The leaves would expire one half
hour after the play is over. Women's
Council is working on this plan.
The Nominating Committee, it
is announced, will meet the week
of May 7. probably the afternoon
of Tuesday, May 8. The work of
Nominating Committee will then

he over before petitions are cir
culated. Any girls interested in
running for the vice-president of
A.S.S.U., Women's Conference
chairman, vice-chairman, or sec
retary, member of Women's Coun
cil, Excom area representative or
freshman representative to Excom,
may come for an interview with
the Committee at this time if they
do not wish to circulate a petition
on their own.

$200 on its ' Back to the Farm"
dance. The proceeds will go to the
Con Home.

houses met with Miss Marks. It was
thought that a Row Excom would
make it easier to get in touch with
the houses and would be especially
helpful for such occasions as the
social program of the Housing Com
mittee.
Elect President
The Excom will be made up of the
vice-presidents of each of the nine
houses. Ann Goodwin, vice-presi
dent of Cubberley, will call a spe
cial meeting this week so that a
president can be chosen.
House presidents announced
that the girls in their houses were
very much in favor of keeping
their houses open until 1:30 on
Saturday nights, so there would be
some place to go after 12. More
action will be takjm on this before
Conference meets again.
Campus Culturals
A plan was suggested whereby all
girls would be able to have one or
two campus culturals per quarter to
use when going to plays on campus.
The leaves would expire one half
hour after the play is over. Women's
Council is working on this plan.
The Nominating Committee, it
is announced, will meet the week
of May 7. probably the afternoon
of Tuesday, May 8. The work of
Nominating Committee will then

he over before petitions are cir
culated. Any girls interested in
running for the vice-president of
A.S.S.U., Women's Conference
chairman, vice-chairman, or sec
retary, member of Women's Coun
cil, Excom area representative or
freshman representative to Excom,
