# Outdoor 'Sing' Planned June 1
## 
### 
Frost Memorial Amphitheater will
be the scene of the annual Spring
Sing, to be held June 1 under the
direction of Martha Austin and the
sponsorship of Cardinals. Ric Sup
ple, Cardinals member, will be em
cee for the occasion and will an
nounce winners of the of BMOC
—best music on campus!
Med School and nurses from Stan
ford Lane Hospital have announced
their intention to compete for the
trophies which are awarded each
year—one to the best musical pres
entation by a men's, women's, or
graduate group.
Twenty-five (25) is the minimum
number of singers that may enlist
from each women's living group.
Reviewing the outcome of last year's
Sing, Cardinals made the ruling that
each entry should include 25 singers
or more in order that the number of
entries might be cut down, and the
quality improved.
Awards to be made to men's,
women's, and graduate groups will
be based on arrangement, selection,
tonal quality, and group appearance.
The judges will be six faculty mem
bers; winners to be announced at
the close of the Sing.
