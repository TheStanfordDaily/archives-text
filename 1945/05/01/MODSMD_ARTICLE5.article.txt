## 
### 
"Some Stanford Writers," will be
the subject of Dr. Margery Bailey's
lecture for the Tuesday Evening
Series tonight in the Memorial Hall
at 7:30.
Dr. Bailey, a Stanford graduate
and now associate professor of Eng
lish here, will discuss the works of
such former Stanford students as
Maxwell Anderson, Archie Binns,
Bruce Bliven, John Steinbeck, Rob
ert Duffus, and others. She knew
all of them except Duff us, as a stu
dent or as a teacher.
Undergraduate Writing
Dr. Bailey will trace the work of
these men as students, showing how
they developed and comparing their
undergraduate work with the writ
ing they are doing today. "Most of
the stress will be laid on how they
wrote as undergraduates, however,"
sne said.
She will read samples of their
writing from "Stanford Writers,
1891-1941," which was published by
the Dramatists' Alliance of the Stan
ford Alumni Association in honor of
the University's birthday celebra
tion. The samples she will read are
taken from such early campus maga
zines as the "Sequoia" and "Car
dinal."
The last few copies of "Stanford
Writers, 1891-1941," are now selling
at book dealers' stores in New York
City at advanced prices.
Criticism and Comparison
Dr. Bailey's talk will be mainly
one of criticism and comparison, she
said. She will also tell of Stanford
faculty members who had the most
important effect on these writers as
undergraduates. They include the
late Professor Seward, the late Mrs.
Russell, and Professors Emeritus
Henry David Gray and Edith Mir
rilies.
While at Stanford, Dr. Bailey ma
jored in English, but took no writ
ing courses because she expected to
be a librarian, she said. All of her
writing has been done since her
graduation, and it has consisted
mainly of scholarly and critical
work, with some writing of chil
dren's romances as well. Her special
field in English is the 17th and 18th
Centuries.
