Stressing the importance of post- i
war international freedom of news. ;
United Press and Associated Press j
newsmen addressed representatives !
of California's student newspapers j
at the San Francisco Press Club |
Sunday. The meeting was the first
of a series of youth meetings to be j
| sponsored by the club during the
United Nations Conference.
Henry C. Cassidy, present editor 1
of AP World Service, author of
"Moscow Dateline," and chief of
AP's Russian bureau for four years, i
i told of censorship barriers in Mos- I
cow that prevent the growth of a j
mutual understanding between the j
United States and Russian people.
i News Censored
Under the Soviet "collectivised i
press" system, the meager supply i
; of news available is censored at the j
! source before it is released to for- j
eign correspondents. This squelches
j most hopes of scoops or individual j
' interpretation, Mr. Cassidy said.
The squabble over the chairman- |
ship of the San Francisco Confer- \
ence was partly due to misunder- |

standings that arise when persons
speak different languages and must
r£ly upon the aid of interpreters, he
stated, explaining that Molotov, Rus
sia's top statesman, had questioned
the issue because of his lack of
knowledge of international customs
involved.
Graceful Withdrawal
''Molotov withdrew quite grace
fully," Mr. Cassidy commented about
the outcome of the dispute.
Summing up his previous state
ments, be said. "The only possible
hope we have is that someday after
the war is won, there w'll be a free
exchange of information, and we
will get to know and understand
each other."
Informal Discussion
Students tossed questions at the
newsman in an informal discussion
period. Asked whether he thought
the Soviet Comintern had been com
pletely dissolved. Mr. Cassidy replied
that it was a question of whether
one accepted in good faith what one
was told .He added. "I frankly be
lieve that Russia has abandoned the
Comintern."

A Stanford representative asked
him if the state department ar
chives should be open to public |
inspection. He answered that there
were some occasions when for se
curity's sake these archives must |
be kept secret.
Diplomacy Delicate
"Diplomacy, is a very delicate
thing," he said. "You can't open
it wide."
Veteran and student newspaper
men alike laughed when AP's pre
mature release of the unofficial Ger
man surrender story was discussed.
Sandor S. Klein, a United Press
UNCIO correspondent, admitted:
"We were very fortunate that we
didn't have a man there at the time
(conferring with Senator Tom Con
nally about the news), or we would
have had the same story.
Washington Coverage
Mr. Klein spoke on the coverage of
the war from Washington, saying of
the early disorganized days of the
war, "We'd have a lot of wordage |
but very little news."
Washington Is covered now by 1
the various press associations that
can send out men on each depart
ment "heat." Factual background
for their interpretive articles is
received from Army and Navy of
ficers selected for the job of hold
ing daily conferences with the
press, Mr. Klein said.
Truman Press Conferences
President Truman will meet with
reporters once a week, according to
Mr. Klein, instead of holding press
conferences twice weekly as did the
late President Roosevelt.
Among the other newspapermen at
the Press Club student meeting, were
Joseph R. Knowland, publisher of
the Oakland Tribune; Harold Turn
blad, division news editor of AP;
George Rowe, managing editor of
the Oakland Post-Enquirer; Dick
Chase, Press Club president; Curtide
Clark, assistant city editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle; and Stan
ton Delaplane of the Chronicle.

j most hopes of scoops or individual j

The squabble over the chairman- |
ship of the San Francisco Confer- \
ence was partly due to misunder- |

standings that arise when persons
speak different languages and must
r£ly upon the aid of interpreters, he
stated, explaining that Molotov, Rus
sia's top statesman, had questioned
the issue because of his lack of
knowledge of international customs
involved.
Graceful Withdrawal
''Molotov withdrew quite grace

Informal Discussion
Students tossed questions at the
newsman in an informal discussion
period. Asked whether he thought
the Soviet Comintern had been com
pletely dissolved. Mr. Cassidy replied
that it was a question of whether
one accepted in good faith what one
was told .He added. "I frankly be
lieve that Russia has abandoned the
Comintern."

A Stanford representative asked
him if the state department ar
chives should be open to public |
inspection. He answered that there
were some occasions when for se
curity's sake these archives must |
be kept secret.
Diplomacy Delicate
"Diplomacy, is a very delicate
thing," he said. "You can't open
it wide."
Veteran and student newspaper
men alike laughed when AP's pre
mature release of the unofficial Ger
man surrender story was discussed.
Sandor S. Klein, a United Press
UNCIO correspondent, admitted:
"We were very fortunate that we
didn't have a man there at the time
(conferring with Senator Tom Con
nally about the news), or we would
have had the same story.
Washington Coverage
Mr. Klein spoke on the coverage of
the war from Washington, saying of
the early disorganized days of the
war, "We'd have a lot of wordage |
but very little news."
Washington Is covered now by 1
the various press associations that
can send out men on each depart
ment "heat." Factual background
for their interpretive articles is
received from Army and Navy of
ficers selected for the job of hold
ing daily conferences with the
press, Mr. Klein said.
Truman Press Conferences
President Truman will meet with
reporters once a week, according to
Mr. Klein, instead of holding press
conferences twice weekly as did the
late President Roosevelt.
Among the other newspapermen at
