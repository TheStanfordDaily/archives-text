# Migration to Con Home Today; Students To Paint, Dig, Repair
## Trucks Will Carry Students For Farm's Annual Labor Day 
### 
Migration of the entire student body will take place this afternoon, as
Corp Yard trucks relay loads of Farm students to the Con Home for Stan
ford's annual Labor Day. After 3 p.m. all men's and women's physical
education classes will be excused for the convenience of the workers.
Trucks will leave the post office in a continuous circuit from 2 to 5:30

this afternoon, and students clad in
work clothes will spend this period
working in the victory garden,
cleaning the yard, repairing play
houses, or painting toys for the con
valescent children.
Box Lunches
Dinner, in the form of box lunches,
will be served to every member of
the student body at 5:30, according
to Chairman Midge Hcxter. No
women's living groups will be open
for evening meals, and men who or
dinarily eat at Encina may pick up
their lunches there and take them
to the Home. Army students,
whether or not they arc able to work
at the Home, are urged to come for
the entertainment and dinner pe
riod.
Women's living groups on the Row
packed their own lunches. Milk will
be supplied at the Home by the A.S.-
S.U. office.

Any students needing first-aid
treatment while working at the
Con Home today should report im
mediately to the main office. This
point was stressed by Mrs. Mabel
Atwood, superintendent of the
Home.

'Band Music
Dick Flint's German band will
play during the afternoon —for the
entertainment of kiddies young and
old, and while students relax over
their lunches, Joe Slier will present
a program of entertainment starring
the Chappies, olio acts from the
spring show, and vocals by Peggy
Hoover. She will also tell jokes.
All living groups will work as
units at the Home, according to Ric
Supple, co-chairman with Ed Luce
of the Labor Day. Foremen will be
assigned to each group as it gathers,
he added —among them Frank de
Lisle, Willie Davics, Tam Crowley,
Milt Valentine, Tom Peake and Gor
don Levy. To each group, specific
| tasks will be delegated, in hopes that
they will be more rapidly and effi
ciently carried out.
Ice Cream, Cokes
Thanks to concessions chairman
Carol Hurwitz, ice cream, cokes, and
popcorn will be sold for 10 cents
apiece, and oranges for 5 cents apiece
throughout the afternoon, proceeds
from which will go to the Home.
Popcorn and oranges were distrib
uted by the Union Store.
Students who wish to drive to the
Home in their own cars may do so,
according to Supplo, but must park
their cars outside the boundaries of
the Home itself.
Mrs. Atwood requested that stu

dents stay outside of the buildings,
confining themselves to the grounds
alone.
Tools are being provided by the
Department of Public Works in Palo
i Alto, the Corp Yard and the Con
Home itseif.
Present Toys
During the morning the trucks
will transport toys out to the Home.
These toys, bought or contributed by
each living unit, were collected by
the vice-presidents of each house.
Police for the affair, headed by Bill
Snow, will be Ed Rosenberg, Dan
Rogers, Rex Alsup, Denny Fox, Par
ker Reische, Tom Peake, and Milt
Valentine.
