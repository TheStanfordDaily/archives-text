### KEN SCHUG 
"The United States loses far more
in one day of war than it could pos
sibly lose during the entire lifetime
of the international monetary fund
proposed at Bretton Woods," stated
Dr. George Dow lie, professor of fi
nance in the Graduate School of
Business at the Palo Alto Forum
Monday night. Dr. Dowric spoke on
the subject "The First Draft of a
World Financial and Economic As
sociation — The Bretton Woods
Agreements," as the third in a series
of forums on the San Francisco
Conference under the auspices of the
Palo Alto Department of Adult Ed
ucation.
Dr. Dowrie began his talk by say
ing that the Bretton Woods discus
sions were devoted to trying to ob
tain freedom from want in the post
war world, as an essential part of
our plans for peace and prosperity.
The monetary conferencc, continued
the speaker, had its goal the stabili
zation of the world's monetary sys
tem. He also mentioned that there
is now a need for a world economic
conference to deal with problems of
tariffs, trade restrictions and equit
able distribution of natural re
sources.
Dr. Dowric insisted that prosperity
is not a single entity, that we do not
lower our standard of living by help
ing other people to live better, but

rather that our own prosperity is
increased if other nations are pros
perous. Therefore, said the speaker,
economic planning must be on a
world-wide basis.
The Bretton Woods agreements
consist of two main divisions, said
Dr. Dowrie, the plan for an interna
tion monetary fund and the plan for
an international bank. lie added
thai although there is almost no op
position to the bank, there have been
strenuous objections to the monetary
fund, especially in the American
Congress. Failure of the United
States Congress to ratify the fund
as well as the bank might well mean
the defeat of the goal of world eco
nomic security, warned the speaker.
The board of directors of the fund
would consist of 12 members, five
of whom must be from the five ma
jor contributors to the fund—United
States, England, Russia, China, and
France, explained Dr. Dowrie. As a
further lure to the United States,
the delegates agreed to establish the
headquarters of the fund, as well as
the bank, in this country. The board
of directors is in constant operation,
he said, and have the power to make
loans from the fund, freeze rates of
exchange — thus preventing dis
astrous currency wars, and otherwise
stabilize the international monetary
.■ystem.
The main purpose of the monetary
fund is to provide "emergency
funds" for member nations which
will be repaid as soon as their finan
cial condition improves, said Dr.
Dowrie. He also thought that the
conditions under which money could
be borrowed would prevent misuse
of the fund.
The bank, said the speaker, will
be similarly managed by a separate
directorate, and will have the func
tions of insuring bonds sold in one
member country by another member
as well as making cash loans when
needed by members. In this way,
private investors in the United States
and elsewhere can buy foreign bonds
without fear of losing their money,
as so many did in the 1920'5, stated
Dr. Dowrie.
In conclusion, Dr. Dowrie said that
both the fund and the bank arc
necessary to the immediate postwar
world, and that it would be impos
sible to wait for prosperity before
putting such plans into operation.
Dr. Dowrie felt sure "that both the
fund and the bank will remain sound
and make important contributions to
the economic security of the world."

member country by another member
as well as making cash loans when
needed by members. In this way,
private investors in the United States
and elsewhere can buy foreign bonds
without fear of losing their money,
as so many did in the 1920'5, stated
Dr. Dowrie.
In conclusion, Dr. Dowrie said that
both the fund and the bank arc
necessary to the immediate postwar
world, and that it would be impos
sible to wait for prosperity before
putting such plans into operation.
Dr. Dowrie felt sure "that both the
fund and the bank will remain sound
and make important contributions to
the economic security of the world."
"The United States loses far more
in one day of war than it could pos
sibly lose during the entire lifetime
of the international monetary fund
proposed at Bretton Woods," stated
Dr. George Dow lie, professor of fi
nance in the Graduate School of
Business at the Palo Alto Forum
Monday night. Dr. Dowric spoke on
the subject "The First Draft of a
World Financial and Economic As
sociation — The Bretton Woods
Agreements," as the third in a series
of forums on the San Francisco
Conference under the auspices of the
Palo Alto Department of Adult Ed
ucation.
Dr. Dowrie began his talk by say
ing that the Bretton Woods discus
sions were devoted to trying to ob
tain freedom from want in the post
war world, as an essential part of
our plans for peace and prosperity.
The monetary conferencc, continued
the speaker, had its goal the stabili
zation of the world's monetary sys
tem. He also mentioned that there
is now a need for a world economic
conference to deal with problems of
tariffs, trade restrictions and equit
able distribution of natural re
sources.
Dr. Dowric insisted that prosperity
is not a single entity, that we do not
lower our standard of living by help
ing other people to live better, but

rather that our own prosperity is
increased if other nations are pros
perous. Therefore, said the speaker,
economic planning must be on a
world-wide basis.
The Bretton Woods agreements
consist of two main divisions, said
Dr. Dowrie, the plan for an interna
tion monetary fund and the plan for
an international bank. lie added
thai although there is almost no op
position to the bank, there have been
strenuous objections to the monetary
fund, especially in the American
Congress. Failure of the United
States Congress to ratify the fund
as well as the bank might well mean
the defeat of the goal of world eco
nomic security, warned the speaker.
The board of directors of the fund
would consist of 12 members, five
of whom must be from the five ma
jor contributors to the fund—United
States, England, Russia, China, and
France, explained Dr. Dowrie. As a
further lure to the United States,
the delegates agreed to establish the
headquarters of the fund, as well as
the bank, in this country. The board
of directors is in constant operation,
he said, and have the power to make
loans from the fund, freeze rates of
exchange — thus preventing dis
astrous currency wars, and otherwise
stabilize the international monetary
.■ystem.
The main purpose of the monetary
fund is to provide "emergency
funds" for member nations which
will be repaid as soon as their finan
cial condition improves, said Dr.
Dowrie. He also thought that the
conditions under which money could
be borrowed would prevent misuse
of the fund.
The bank, said the speaker, will
be similarly managed by a separate
directorate, and will have the func
tions of insuring bonds sold in one
member country by another member
as well as making cash loans when
needed by members. In this way,
private investors in the United States
and elsewhere can buy foreign bonds
without fear of losing their money,
as so many did in the 1920'5, stated
