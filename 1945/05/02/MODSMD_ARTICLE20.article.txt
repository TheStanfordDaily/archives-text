# STANFORD'S BABY
## 
### 
Today's the day! No Hitler, no Mussolini, and
no classes from one to five. Today lots of
£:':anford students will probably do the biggest
thing that they'll ever do while at Stanford.
It isn't tops in thrills, or entertainment, or sump
tuousness of any tangible kind.
Probably few will think it notable as they do
it, but the contribution that each student can
make today by showing up to do the odds and
er ' that have to be *lone at the children's
Convalescent Heme, will demonstrate accept
ance of a lesson that isn't found in any text
book, but illustrates them all.
All of us spend a lot of time here freely
criticizing society, the universe, and life in
general. We like our own little theories, some
times a professor's, some follow them to ex
tremes, others conveniently pigeonhole them
for exams and never air them at all; one addi
tion 1 lesson with which Stanford can provide
us is this tradition that has made the children's
Convalescent Home the responsibility of Stan
ford students.
One thing wrong with the life we lead here
.'it school is that our privileges are more evident
th n our responsibilities. The Con Home is
one of the most pleasant responsibilities that
we will ever have.
The hundreds of kids that have recovered
from illnesses at the home will probably always
fool a lot better about people, in general, than
the many who have had to recover without such
t"icl; the way that feeling can be ours, too, is just
one of the many amazing things about Con
Home Week.
An essential part of knowing and being Stan
ford at its best is to join in today's activities
and pitch in where we can at the Home and for
the Home. This is our baby!
