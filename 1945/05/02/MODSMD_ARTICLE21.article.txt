AI times like this, the filling of a particular
swatch of space in the Peninsula's O.M.N., or
anywhere else, becomes a problem of nail
chewing proportions. From where I sit, as one
blank space to another, the problem is always
there, but the blank at this end of the wire has
become a victim of the conditions that prevail;
columns from here to Christmas are jockeying
for position. All of a sudden, the world is too
lull of a number of things.
The demands of history, local and otherwise,
are running way ahead of people's private
schedules; you can hardly bring yourself to
; iep into the Reserve Book Room (even history
won't follow you in there), in case the parade
rhould go by outside and leave you among
the dust-eaters. (This line is available for use
-;t the tail-end of butched mid-terms on payment
of a small but unreasonable fee.)
Walking in the door, this colyum was going
lo be about the Con Home Drive, today being
Labor Day. Jeans and your big brother's shorts
are official for the afternoon campaign against
the weed that grows in Brooklyn. All good men,
-.nd the rest of you, too, are invited to come to
Ihe aid of the party.
Then came a communique from the Depart
ment of Rosy Futures, to the effect that the
fleet is in, or nearly in, at Stanford. It's the
world's greatest, kids, and here's where we
U p depending on "Time" magazine to tell us
so. Some of us, that is. Look around you; the
green complexion denotes what we used
lo c.ill the better half of the class of '45 (while
w<. were only half, that was.) As far as we're
concerned, it's another case of too little and

too late. Does anyone care to join that Club
for Perpetual Candidates?
And then came the pay-off. There was a
report that Hitler was dead, followed at a dead
run by the front page of the Call-Bulletin, where
never is heard a discouraging word. It was, and
still is, hard to believe, even in two-inch head
lines. Hitler was a story out of the world's
past, a story that has made ten years of strange
and bloody reading for us and people bigger
than we are, and now it appears that the end
has been written for everybody to see.
If it turns out to be true, the date some of us
wrote on our ex's yesterday morning will go
down in the history books. And some of those
contemporary governments abroad that we've
been hearing about are not contemporary any
more. They belong in the next volume of
Western Civ, the volume we learned the hard
way.

AI times like this, the filling of a particular
swatch of space in the Peninsula's O.M.N., or
anywhere else, becomes a problem of nail
chewing proportions. From where I sit, as one
blank space to another, the problem is always
there, but the blank at this end of the wire has
become a victim of the conditions that prevail;
columns from here to Christmas are jockeying
for position. All of a sudden, the world is too
lull of a number of things.
The demands of history, local and otherwise,
are running way ahead of people's private

concerned, it's another case of too little and

And then came the pay-off. There was a
report that Hitler was dead, followed at a dead
run by the front page of the Call-Bulletin, where
never is heard a discouraging word. It was, and
still is, hard to believe, even in two-inch head
lines. Hitler was a story out of the world's
past, a story that has made ten years of strange
and bloody reading for us and people bigger
than we are, and now it appears that the end
has been written for everybody to see.
If it turns out to be true, the date some of us
wrote on our ex's yesterday morning will go
down in the history books. And some of those
contemporary governments abroad that we've
been hearing about are not contemporary any

Western Civ, the volume we learned the hard
way.
