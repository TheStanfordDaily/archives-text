The monotonous regularity of the Plenary Sessions
of the San Francisco Conference, was broken last
Monday by the Argentine question.
The seemingly innocent business of reporting the
work of the steering committee started it. The chief
of the Cuban delegation, recognized by Mr. Eden,
then presiding, read the reports, first giving the
committee recommendation that the Ukranian and
White Russian Soviet Socialist Republics be seated
immediately. This was passed without comment.
Then he recommended the same for Argentina.
That did it.
AKC;ENTINE QUESTION
Mr. Eden asked for comments, and M. Molotov,
followed by his interpreter, Pavlov, arose to the
speaker's platform.
Molotov made a long speech, Pavlov translating it
not too well. He said that the question had not been
fully considered in conference, that Argentina had
been Fascist, and might well still be, and that Poland
deserved more to be admitted than Argentina, yet
was not. He summed up with:
"We would like to ask that the question be post
poned for a few adys so it can be more fully con
sidered by the sponsors of the conference. That is
the Soviet delegation's only request."
After that, eight other chief of delegations arose
to speak, by far the majority being South American,
minister of foreign affairs, in favor of immediate
seating. Mr. Eden brought the question to a vote
as quickly as he could, and the Soviet was literally
flattened by 31 pros against the 7 that he influenced.
POLAND
In another effort to win a victory, Molotov tried
to get Poland seated, but v/as voted down again.
With two defeats in back of him, it became a
question of what he will do. There are three rumors,
as improbable as they are unsubstantiated, that try
to form an answer.
1. M. Molotov will leave for Russia, but the Soviet
delegation will remain.
2. The Soviet Union will withdraw altogether.
3. Molotov will ask for 16 votes, one for each
Soviet Republic, instead of only three.
YALTA
It does not seem that the seating of the Argentine,
or the refusal to seat Poland, mean too much to
the Soviet, considering what was reported by relia
ble sources to have been Premier Stalin's attitude
on a general conference during the Yalta discussions.
"I do not care too much what Luxembourg thinks
about it,"he said, "or what Peru's opinion is. If the
Big Three can hold together, there will be peace, no
matter what the little nations do."
Since Russia doesn't care what the little nations
say, what does it matter to her what are at the
conference and what are not?
Molotov's fight, in light of this, was probably simply
an effort to gain a few points which he can give up,
if other nations will grant him more important ones.
In short, he tried to establish a better bargaining
position. But an effective and efficient South Amer
ican bloc prevented this.
If Molotov is a realist, he will probably realize it
will also stop any 16 vote drive.
Therefore, the net result of Monday's tilt will be
to preserve the status quo in regards to pre-con
ference bargaining power. It was constructive in
nature, since it will probably put a minimum on
such haggling by showing it unprofitable. Besides
that, it does not seem too significant.
