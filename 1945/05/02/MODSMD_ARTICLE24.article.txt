# World Peace Notes-'45

### TED DRENTON 
Hitler is dead! The German radio announced that
the commander of the naval forces will take his place
in a new regime to prevent the influx of Bolshevism.
II is difficult to tell whether this startling news
is verity or merely audacious bluff by the Germans
to hide Der Fuhrer's whereabouts. The German
leaders will do anything to save themselves from
reckoning thy must face.
Perhaps too, they may hope desperately to save
something of their regime if they get rid of the
man that is most obnoxious to us. We must believe
nothing until we have his body for evidence.
Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden has been re
ported negotiating a German unconditional sur
render to the Allies. Not much of the master race
or its territory remains to be surrendered, except
fleeing remnants of supermen hiding on their last
fragments of conquered soil.
ALLIED OCCUPATION
With peace the real problems of the world will
begin. Different areas of Germany will be occupied
respectively by the different Allied armies, and
the questions of disposing of the war criminals and
reduction of (his misled people must be dealt with
wisely.
We should make it known to the German people
that so long as they don't practice our ways ol life
or the obligations of human decency, they must
suffer our occupation. However it should be made
clear to them that, as soon as they sincerely prac
tice democracy and re-educate their children in the
ways of peace, the occupation will be terminated, and
they can rejoin the society of nations.
IT'S UP TO TIIEM
Wc must put it up to them. If they see that there
is more to gain by working with us than against
us, then they may repent, or else certainly they
will be forever disgracefully occupied.
Of course there will he much underground op
position to our occupation forces, but if we are
firm, the majority of intelligent Germans will
quickly sec the lij{ht and behave themselves. Where
we can, we may help or advise them politically:
but they must do most of the work themselves.
During the occupation the real world crisis will
occur, for if we do not deal wisely with this situa
tion. then another terrible war is inevitable.
