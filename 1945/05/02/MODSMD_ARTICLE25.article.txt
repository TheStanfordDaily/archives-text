# OUR HASHER

### JOE SHER 
"Shades of ihe Postman."
' Bite me, rip me, mash me," par
aphrased can be made to read "put
the bite on me, rip the last vestige
of cash from my weary check book,
mash my aching fingers and back
down into the weeds of the old Con
Home, so that I can give my all for
the little kiddies down at the Con
Home.
It is with these joyful words
that many of the Stanford family
look forward to a swell day of
blisters, poison oak, sunburn and
dirt, at Stanford's own private
charity, the Convalescent Home.
With the soliciting well-launched
and students bringing in fabulous
amounts, the drive looks well on the
way to being one of the greatest of
all and the eager response of the In
dians to the pressing need is indeed
gratifying to these old eyes.
"Brunch Time"
The Strawberry Brunch was a
complete success, as long before
Mary Al Smith got completely
wound up, the strawberries were
gone down the gullets of berry
hungry and quarter-wealthy stu
dents.
The excellent entertainment
provided by the members of the
Spring Show held the eager thou
sands enthralled and a repeat of
their performance today (after
work) will be a treat well worth
seeing. These excellent acts will
he supplemented hy many more
and the entire show promises to
he worth any effort.
Starting at 2 o'clock, trucks will
begin to truck the people on down to
the good earth. Plop on the first
truck you see and drop your denim
clad body down among thousands
of others who are riding the sardine
specials.
"This is the Rub"
When you got there listen to the
commands of the foremen, who are
in reality frustrated army sergeants
and at their gentle commands grab
any old hoe or shovel and pitch
into your communion with nature.
There are plenty of weeds to go
around for everybody so don't hes
itate if you feel that you can't have
room for expression without the
wide open spaces around you.
Refreshments can he purchased
from serving girls down at the
Home so that it will not he neces
sary for anyone to bring their own,
besides it's against the rules to
have reeb on the old homestead.
For all those who have afternoon
labs and can't come until 4 or so
don't hesitate to come at that time.
In the hour before supper you can
accomplish enough to have helped
a great deal and each little bit
helps.
"Your Move"
Suitable clothes for the afternoon
are sack suits, denims or what
have-you. Sweaters will not be
necessary as the afternoon promises
to be warm and they are a detri
ment to production.
All this little information is build
ing up to only one thing, which is
to get the heck out there and give
your all for the group who reside
in the Con Home. Your effort can
make their stay shorter and more
pleasant; this can be your present.

"Your Move"
Suitable clothes for the afternoon
are sack suits, denims or what
have-you. Sweaters will not be
necessary as the afternoon promises

ment to production.
All this little information is build

"Shades of ihe Postman."
' Bite me, rip me, mash me," par
aphrased can be made to read "put
the bite on me, rip the last vestige
of cash from my weary check book,
mash my aching fingers and back
down into the weeds of the old Con
Home, so that I can give my all for
the little kiddies down at the Con
Home.
It is with these joyful words
that many of the Stanford family
look forward to a swell day of
blisters, poison oak, sunburn and
dirt, at Stanford's own private
charity, the Convalescent Home.

dians to the pressing need is indeed
gratifying to these old eyes.

Starting at 2 o'clock, trucks will
begin to truck the people on down to

truck you see and drop your denim
clad body down among thousands
of others who are riding the sardine
specials.
"This is the Rub"
When you got there listen to the
commands of the foremen, who are
in reality frustrated army sergeants
and at their gentle commands grab
any old hoe or shovel and pitch
into your communion with nature.
There are plenty of weeds to go
around for everybody so don't hes
itate if you feel that you can't have
room for expression without the
wide open spaces around you.
