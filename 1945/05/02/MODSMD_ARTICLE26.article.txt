# Barzun's Book Good For Student Reading

### SYDNEY ROSS 
TEACHER IN AMERICA, by Jac
ques Barzun. (Little, Brown and
Company.) *t2l pp. $3.00.
Teaching is a personal experience
for both the teacher and the student
and it is in the interplay of their
temperaments that the process of
teaching somehow takes place. It is,
therefore, appropriate that in this
book the personality of the author
should figure so prominently. It is
essentially from the personal view
point that the ideas are presented;
they are illustrated by personal rec
ollections and the author retains the
center of the stage throughout.
This method has both inherent ad
vantages and disadvantages. II has
the immense advantage of catching
attention, of enlivening a topic that
can be discussed in a manner pro
foundly dull. But at the same time
it places a great strain on the au
thor's personality; only a broad and
well-stocked mind, a sympathetic
and amiable character and a sturdy
common sense can sustain the read
er's attention through three hundred
pages.
Not all those qualities are appar
ent in this work and consequently
its weaknesses are glaringly dis
played. For although the more am
bitious method here adopted is un
equaled when it is successful, when
it fails it is lamentably crass. The
book is uneven throughout.
Mr. Barzun runs the risk of alien
ating an adult reader at the outset.
His style is informal and even flip
pant but, much worse, occasionally
bumptious and lacking in modesty.
The examples of his own experiences
with students invariably demon
strate his gifts of repartee, insight
and ability to "inspire," or testify to
the gratitude of his former students
and the stupidity of his opponents.

While it may be good practical ad- j
j vice never to tell a story against
j yourself, it is certainly no less the
way of wisdom to beware the other
I extreme.
But the reader who has the pa
| tience to overlook Mr. Barzun's self-
J laudatory footnotes will find a great
deal of worth-while material in this
book. The ideas are not original
with Mr. Barzun, and his forcible
style of presentation and criticism
may well exert considerable influ
ence. This is precisely what we ex
pect from a teacher and Mr. Barzun's
I book about teaching is itself a good I
j example of his teaching methods.
It is a matter of fairly common
observation that student judgments
of teachers are not trustworthy. As
a rule the undergraduate does not
even know what he has a right to
expect from his teachers and, just
as important, what he has no right to
expect. Yet the importance of mak
ing correct judgments is shown ev
ery day, when we see students act
ing on the basis of whatever opin
ions they have evolved, or accepted,
about the faculty.
I therefore recommend this book
for student reading. The style is
likely to be attractive to young peo
ple who enjoy watching the blows
fall thick and fast; its subject mat
ter is one which they will have to
consider sometime and it will pro
vide them with truer principles for
estimating their teachers than they
are likely to obtain from gossip at
the Boathouse or from the fellow
who took the course last quarter.
On the other hand, I am inclined
to warn faculty members, especially
those in the physical sciences, away
from this book. There is no reason
why they should spend three dollars
to court a rise of blood pressure.â€”
