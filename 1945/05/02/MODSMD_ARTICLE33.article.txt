# India On Way To Freedom
## Unity Possible Now Says British Teacher 
### 
"I believe that the Hindus and
the Moslems in India would be more
likely to work in close agreement if
India were free of the British," said
Horace G. Alexander in a talk to a
joint picnic of the International Club
and Wesley Foundation Sunday af
ternoon. Mr. Alexander is at present
in San Francisco as a press corre
spondent at the Conference.
Knows Gandhi
Mr. Alexander, who is a personal
friend of the Indian national leader,
Mohandas K. Gandhi, began his talk
by recounting briefly his experiences
as the head of a British Friends Am
bulance Unit in India in 1942 and
1943. He pointed out that this unit
worked in harmony with both the
British and National governments in
India, and devoted their efforts to
the relief of suffering during the
famine with no discrimination at all.
Mr. Alexander mentioned that al
though large-scale famines, such as
the one in 1943 which took at least
one million lives, are quite rare, over
350 million Indians are constantly
undernourished. This problem of
want should be of concern to the
entire world, said the speaker. He
added that although the millions of
vitamins supplied by American Qua
kers saved thousands of lives during
the famine, the problems of broken
lives and shattered homes are still
being tackled by Friends Units sta
tioned in India.
Indians Skeptical
The Indians are extremely skepti
cal of British promises for eventual
freedom on the condition that India
be internally united, since an im
perialistic British government can
always find some group within India
which has not united with other uni
fied groups. He further stated that
the British administrators in India
have lost faith in their ability to gov
ern India, and that only the Indian
National Government can carry out
the reforms needed to improve In
dia's miserable economic plight.
Mr. Alexander has been Director
of Studies and Professor of Inter
national Relations at Woodbrooke
College in Birmingham, England.
His latest visit with Gandhi was dur
ing Gandhi's latest fast in 1942 at
Puna, India.
Gandhi and he first met in 1930.
when the Indian leader was in Eng
land for the Round Table discus
sions, said the speaker.
