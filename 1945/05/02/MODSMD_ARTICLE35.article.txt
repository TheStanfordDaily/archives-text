# Nehru's Sister Talks On Indian Freedom
## India Awaits Fact of Liberation as Promised In Conference Terms, States Mrs. Pandit PETE CARPENTER 
### 
The distinguished Mrs. Vihayalaksmi Pandit, sister to the great Indian
leader and incarcerated president of the Indian National Congress Juwa
harlal Nehru, spoke to a jammed and enthusiastic audience in the Scottish
Rite Auditorium Friday night.
Introducing Mrs. Pandit were Dr. Shridharani, author of the best-

silling hook on Indian affairs, "My
India, My America!, Dr. J. .1. Singh,
and Dr. Rowland Roman.
As background for Mrs. Pandit's
talk, Mr. Shridharani said India's
main problem is simply poverty, and
the only way the Indian people can
ever be sufficiently led will be fo'r
Americans to help and insist on (he
industrialization of India. He im
plied that the British would never
make that move.
Mrs. Pandit made it clear that
she is here in no official capacity.
As the representative of the Indian
people, the official delegates are
appointed by the British, she has
not yet been able to get a seat in
the Conference Hall, but she is
watching to see the San Francisco
Conference do what they claim
to do.
She stated that she had no dis
agreement with the plans or
terms of the peace conference
as they are stated on paper. Rut
she emphasized the fact that no
ble sentiments on paper are of no
use to a country which is await
ing the fact of "liberation."
The detached and dignified Mrs.
Pandit occasionally referred with
quiet irony to British policies in
India. Said Mrs. Pandit: "The Brit
ish have borne the white man's
burden in India for many years
now. We would be glad to relieve
them of that burden."
She warned flatly that if the
British expect the Indian people
to wait for independence to be
handed to them at some indefinite
future date when they are united
and "ready for it," they may he
surprised when a united India
decides to take that independence
by force, before the British are
"ready for it."
She said the younger generation
of India would probably repudiate
Gandhi's leadership if his past and
present policy of non-violence does
nt show any results for Indian free
dom after this war.
She pointed out that the white
man's prestige has been lowered
tremendously in the Asiatic area
where the whites in Malay, Bur
ma, Java, and Singapore failed to
live up to their responsibility for
the brown, ignored the unpre
pared and unprotected native pop
ulations and fled when the Japa
nese bombardment started.
The people of India, she "stated, do
not consider the British representa
tives at the Conference as their rep-'
resentatives, and they will not hesi
tate to ignore any decisions they
may reach for India.
India is being represented at
the San Francisco Conference as
a sovereign nation. The delegates
are British, and it is certainly ob
vious when the sister of the lead
er of the Indian people asks for
the liberation of India that India
is not a sovereign nation.
"Security is equality of power,"
said Mrs. Pandit. "If liberation is
the overall policy for the peoples of
the world, why is not India in
cluded?
"The future should belong to In
dia too. What meaning has your
much-used word freedom if it is
denied to others?"

She pointed out that the white
man's prestige has been lowered
tremendously in the Asiatic area
where the whites in Malay, Bur
ma, Java, and Singapore failed to
live up to their responsibility for
the brown, ignored the unpre
pared and unprotected native pop
ulations and fled when the Japa

The people of India, she "stated, do
not consider the British representa

resentatives, and they will not hesi

may reach for India.
India is being represented at
the San Francisco Conference as
a sovereign nation. The delegates
are British, and it is certainly ob
vious when the sister of the lead
er of the Indian people asks for
the liberation of India that India
is not a sovereign nation.
"Security is equality of power,"
said Mrs. Pandit. "If liberation is
the overall policy for the peoples of
the world, why is not India in
cluded?
"The future should belong to In
dia too. What meaning has your
much-used word freedom if it is
denied to others?"


VIJAYA LAKSHMI PANDIT
The distinguished Mrs. Vihayalaksmi Pandit, sister to the great Indian
leader and incarcerated president of the Indian National Congress Juwa
harlal Nehru, spoke to a jammed and enthusiastic audience in the Scottish
Rite Auditorium Friday night.
Introducing Mrs. Pandit were Dr. Shridharani, author of the best-

silling hook on Indian affairs, "My
India, My America!, Dr. J. .1. Singh,
and Dr. Rowland Roman.
As background for Mrs. Pandit's
talk, Mr. Shridharani said India's
main problem is simply poverty, and
the only way the Indian people can
ever be sufficiently led will be fo'r
Americans to help and insist on (he
industrialization of India. He im
plied that the British would never
make that move.
Mrs. Pandit made it clear that
she is here in no official capacity.
As the representative of the Indian
people, the official delegates are
appointed by the British, she has
not yet been able to get a seat in
the Conference Hall, but she is
watching to see the San Francisco
Conference do what they claim
to do.
She stated that she had no dis
agreement with the plans or
terms of the peace conference
as they are stated on paper. Rut
she emphasized the fact that no
ble sentiments on paper are of no
use to a country which is await
ing the fact of "liberation."
The detached and dignified Mrs.
Pandit occasionally referred with
quiet irony to British policies in
India. Said Mrs. Pandit: "The Brit
ish have borne the white man's
burden in India for many years
now. We would be glad to relieve
them of that burden."
She warned flatly that if the
British expect the Indian people
to wait for independence to be
handed to them at some indefinite
future date when they are united
and "ready for it," they may he
surprised when a united India
decides to take that independence
by force, before the British are
"ready for it."
She said the younger generation
of India would probably repudiate
Gandhi's leadership if his past and
present policy of non-violence does
nt show any results for Indian free
dom after this war.
