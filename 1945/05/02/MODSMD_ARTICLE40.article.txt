# Boozer Ten Cops Sixth
## Monroe Smothers Legal Eagles, 12-3 
### BOB GILKEY 
As the first round of play in the
intramural Softball league drew to a
close, Monroe's Belting Boozers con
tinued to rids high, wide, and hand
some on top of the circuit with six
victories and no defeats. The Booz
ers copped their sixth successive de
cision from the Legal Eagles, win
ning by a 12-3 count.
The Boozers once again demon
strated their terrific slugging power
as they chalked up another lopsided
triumph. The big inning for Monroe
was the fourth, when five Boozers
dented home plate. The Eagles were
outclassed from the beginning and
dropped into a tie for fifth as a result
of the loss.
Phi Psi and Buchanan hooked up
in a slugfest, with the Phi Psi's fi
nally coming out on top, 16-9. The
victory moved Phi Psi up a notch,
irom a fourth-place tie to sole pos
session of third, while Buchanan
sank from second to fourth.
The Phi Psi's were still without
the services of Luke Pitts, their star
hurler, but pitching was definitely
not needed as Phi Psi blasted across
four markers in the third frame,
three in the fourth, and seven in the
fifth to clinch the contest. Buchanan
came back strongly in the final in
nings but was unable to overcome
the wide Phi Psi lead.
The all-Toyon grudge battle be
tween Arguello and the Flacs turned
into a rout, with the Arguellans win
ning, 11-4. After the Flacs went
ahead, 2-0. in the first, Tony Orte
ga's team bounced back with a four
run outburst in the second to move
into a lead which they never relin
quished.
The Flac players, with a dismal
record of six straight losses, have
decided to grow beards until they
win a game. However, they were
only able to garner three hits against
Arguello yesterday and must de
velop more hitting power if they
expect to trounce hard-hitting Bu
chanan on Thursday.
In the fourth game, the Med
School won a default match from
the Tyler Hilltoppers.
Thursday's tussles bring the first
round of league play to a conclusion.
Monroe meets up-and-coming Ar
guello in the feature attraction, and
in other contests, Phi Psi battles Ty
ler, the Med School tackles the Le
gal Eagles, and Buchanan collides
with the Flacs. The second round
will open next Tuesday.
