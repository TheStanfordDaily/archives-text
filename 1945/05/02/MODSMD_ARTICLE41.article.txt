# Musial Plays for Fleet City
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
The Palo Alto Independents are
meeting more than they bargained
for when they play Fleet City this
Friday on the Palo Alto High School
diamond. A recent addition to the
big league studded roster of the
Bluejackets is Stan) Musial, world
championship St. Louis Cardinal
outfielder. Stan was second in the
big league batting race last season
with a mark of .347. and in 1943 he
was awarded the National League's
most valuable player award, and
widely acclaimed as the most out-
I standing rookie of the year. Musial
is a long ball hitter and the short
fences of the Paly High Held ought
to be 'duck soup" for him. Two
j other big guns on the Fleet City
nine are Harvey Storey, former Chi
; cago Cub, and Eddie Fernandes.
One serious handicap for the In
dependents will undoubtedly be lack
of team practice and proper coach
ing. However the P.A.I, boys have
a Thursday game <vith Lincoln High
of San Jose and their success there
will be highly indicative of their
chances against the Bluejackets.
Admission will be charged and
j the proceeds will go to the Stanford
Convalescent Home drive, according
to Bob Rosburg, team manager. The
i chance to witness Stan Musial in
action will be worth the admission
price alone, for the former Cardinal
| star is definitely a drawing card in
| any league.
Tentative P.A.I, lineup is as fol
lows: Catcher, Ed Hall; pitcher,
"Doc" Mason; first base, Tom Hood;
second base, Ted Morrison; third
base, Rob Rosburg; shortstop, Tom
Ashley; left field, Ray RRyan; cen
ter field, Dennis Fox, and right field,
j Joe Sher.
