# Nurse's Aide Course Proves Popular with Farm Students
## 
### MARION MORROW 
Stanford began its nurse's aide
program in 1942, and has given it
steadily every quarter since, says
Mrs. Dare Stark McMullin, volun
teer chairman of public relations for
the Palo Alto Red Cross.
The course, taught by Mrs. Mar
garet Riasetto, registered public
health nurse, is so popular that there
is always a long waiting list. Only a
limited number of prospective aides
may be taken in the hospital, but
the enrollment, which used to be
sixteen, is now increased to twenty.
Eighty hours of instruction com
plete the course, with forty of the
hours spent in actual practice as
apprentices in the hospital.
At the end of the eighty hours, a
formal graduation is held and the
new nurse's aides are presented with

their pins and allowed to wear their
uniforms for the first time.
'Fifty hours of work a quarter af
ter graduation is required, or 150
hours a year. Most of the girls put
in their time in the afternoons, eve
nings, and week-ends.
According to the patients there
is no preference for the older Palo
Alto women, and Stanford girls
have often caused the Red Cross
to receive letters from patients
recommending the nurse's aides on
duty.
The only difficulty occasionally
arises when the girls do not realize
how hard it is to replace them if
they do not show up for their as
signed hours.
Hospitals formerly requiring eight
or nine nurses can now get along
with one or two if they have the

I volunteer nurses. Many of the older
nurses in Palo Alto are being re
} leased by the aides to work at
J Dibble.
The aides do the same work as the
| nurses, with the exception of ad-
I ministering medicine.
A year ago Stanford nurse's
aides worked during Christmas
vacation to keep the hospital open
during the flu epidemic.
The girls who graduated last quar
ter are: Nadine Bergerot, Alexandra
; Adams, Pat Kingston, Elizabeth Kell.
Jo Edwards, Joan Law.
Grace Campbell, Betty Elliott,
Barbara Brooks, Charlotte Goodwin,
Mary Narina Raddel, Jo Glasson,
Joyce Costello, Mary Scherrer, Su
sanne Bassett, Doris McEachran,
Nina Park, Elinore Stone, Enid
I Hutchinson.
