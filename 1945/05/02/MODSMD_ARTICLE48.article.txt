# Dr. Holsti Praises Old Friends Now Delegates at Conference
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
A roster of fame to most of us; a
group of old friends to Dr. Rudolf
Holsti, political science professor.
For he personally knows and ad
mires many of the delegates to the
World Security Conference.
As Finland's delegate to the
League of Nations, he has met some
of them in Geneva; he was intro
duced to others at state dinners in
Paris and London. He knows men
and women from every part of the
world.
Now his old friends have flocked
to the San Francisco Conference, and
hopes to pay his respects to all of
these ladies and gentlemen. "But
not until they settle down," he added
smiling.
Five Pounds of Honey
When he was asked to describe
some of these delegates, he threw up
his hands in despair. "It would take j
five pounds of honey to do them all |
justice," he declared. "I am so full
of admiration for these people."
He began to talk at random, once
or twice interrupting himself with a
quiet chuckle at the expense of
some celebrity. He spoke respect
fully of Mr. Anthony Eden, a friend
of 20 years standing, and one of the
most popular members ever in the
League of Nations. Dr. Holsti con
siders him one of the most important
statesmen of our time.
He mentioned the "most generous
hospitality" that Mr. Eden had ex
tended to him and his wife when
Dr. Holsti was representing Finland |
at Ihe coronation in London in 1937.
He mentioned, too, their luncheons
and dinners together in Geneva at
the Finnish legation.
Eden, the Artist
One of his favorite sketches of '

Mr. Eden involves a commission
meeting and "a too-long speech." He
and Mr. Eden were seated opposite
one another, and both gentlemen
were bored. Mr. Eden took a piece
of paper and began to sketch a land
scape. He had inherited his father's
artistic talent, and before the speech
was over he had completed a very
fine picture. Dr. Holsti begged it
for a souvenir and now considers it
one of his "most precious papers."
Dr. Holsti thinks highly of Lord
and Lady Halifax, and he tells a
favorite story about Lord Halifax. In
1938 Dr. Holsti visited London as
Foreign Minister of Finland. Lord
Halifax invited him to a great lunch
eon where among numerous other
guests some party leaders were pres
ent; and at cofTee time took him to
a table where Lord Sncll, Mr. Attlcct
and several other leaders were seat
ed. Lord Halifax introduced him
jokingly. "Now you can infect Mr.
Holsti to the best of your ability. I
will disinfect him later."
French Orator
When asked about the French del
egation, Dr. Holsti grew enthusiastic
about many of his old acquaintances.
There is Paul Boncour, former Pre
mier of France and one of the great
French delegates to the old League
of Nations. Dr. Holsti describes him
as a great orator and lawyer, much
like Mirabeau, and a man of strong
principles.
Only a year ago he said goodby to
M. and Mme. Henri Bonnet. M.
Bonnet was leaving for Algiers to be
Minister of Propaganda for the Free
French government. Now he is re
turning as ambassador to Washing
ton and delegate to the Conference.
Panorama
A few inches of print cannot tell

all that Dr. Holsti said. He told of
too many people: M. Spaak and oth
ers from Belgium, B. Bech of Lux
embourg, and M. Van KlefTens of
the Netherlands. He praised M.
Pelt, one-time director of the infor
mation section in the Secretariat of
the League of Nations, now one of
the Dutch delegates. He looks for
ward to meeting again the Greek
ambassador, Aghnides, who was the
director of the Security and Disar
j mament Sections in the League. He
spoke too of his old acquaintance,
Field Marshal Smuts, Premier of the
Union of South Africa, and his col
leagues Mr. and Mrs. Harry An
drews.
He told of the Chinese ambas
sador, Dr. Wellington Koo, a bril
liant man and leading Chinese
statesman, and Dr. Hoo Chi-tsai, one
of Dr. Holsti's most intimate col
leagues in Geneva.
"It goes without saying that I also
know several Norwegian delegates,"
he continued, "all very old friends."
He mentioned in particular Mr.
J Hambro, president of the Norwegian
Parliament, "a man of lofty princi
ples and a deep sense of the practi
cal."
Two-Hour Defeat
Dr. Holsti told of one memorable
day during the Ethiopian invasion.
A great Finnish sculptor had made
a bronze bust of Paul Boncour, and
Dc. Holsti had invited the French
delegation to a solemn little cere
mony. At the height of the enthu
siasm he was presenting the bust to
I M. Boncour, when a secret agent ar
rived from Mussolini. He wanted to
see M. Boncour immediately, so Dr.
Holsti led the two men to his library.
Two hours later they emerged, the
Italian furious, Boncour smiling.
Mussolini had lost; France would not
would not support Italy.
Dr. Holsti concluded with a seri
i ous note. "It is to be hoped the Con
! fcrcnce will be a complete success
j and unanimity will prevail. For the
peaceful future of mankind it is of
I capital importance that the new
world organization be set up."
He deeply admires the delegates
and is sure they will represent their
countries well.
