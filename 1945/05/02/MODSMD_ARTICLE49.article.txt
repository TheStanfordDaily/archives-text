# Blood--Our New Weapon
## Stanford Chemists Aid In Research Program 
### KEN SCHUG 
Today hospitals and laboratories
throughout the world arc writing a
story in blood which promises to
give man powerful new weapons in
his struggle against disease and in
jury. These weapons are obtained
from human blood, and arc being
used in an ever-increasing variety
of ways to restore health to sick and
wounded bodies.
Under the direction of Dr. J.
Murray Luck, professor of bio
chemistry, the Stanford Depart
ment of Chemistry has been co
operating in a nationwide blood
protein research program under
the direction of the Office of Sci
entific Research and Development.
Many universities and hospitals
throughout the United States arc
also contributing to this program.
The work at Stanford has been
largely on the investigation of the
thermal stability of blood protein so
lutions in an efTort to find a way to
preserve the solutions indefinitely
under unfavorably high temperature
conditions. The significance of this
process is that users of solutions de
rived from blood have long been
handicapped by a tendency of pro
teins in solution to flocculate out
when heated, a process known as
coagulation. This condition has made
it difficult to use blood derivatives
in tropical regions or other hot re
gions.
Other work in the Stanford Iabo
rator has concerned the gamma glob
ulins, the blood grouping globulins
of plasma, and the fibrinolytic en
zyme. This work will be published
later.
In their study of the coagulation
of human scrum albumin, one of
the proteins found in the plasma
of human blood, the Stanford
chemists have determined the ef
fect of various chemicals on the
thermal stability of protein solu
tions. Definite amounts of these
chemicals have been added to the
solutions and accurate data re
corded of their stability at differ
ent temperatures.
After preliminary work revealed
certain compounds which seemed to
produce the desired stabilizing effect
on the protein solutions, further ex
periments were conducted to discov
er the mode of action of these pro
tective substances. Work on this as
pect of the problem is still going on
in the biochemical laboratory. Some
of the recent work includes studies
of the behavior of protein solutions
under the influence of an electric
field, including a property known as
electrophoretic mobility.
The work in the Stanford labo
ratories has been due to efforts of
a number of research chemists in
the Department of Chemistry.
Former workers on the project are
Dr. Tomkins, Dr. Gerald Ballou, Dr.
Randall Rice, and Funston Lum. At
present, those employed are Dr. Paul
Boyer, Dr. Eric Hecgard, and Rene
Bolomcy.
The chemical section of the blood
protein studies pursued in this coun
try was initiated principally by Dr.
Edwin J. Cohn of the Harvard Medi
cal School. This work was begun by
Dr. Cohn and his associates early in
1041. All the laboratories engaged in
this research do so under direct con
tract, recommended by the Commit
tee on Medical Research, with the
Office of Scicntific Research and De
velopment.
The story of the achievements of
these efforts to get new life from
blood is still being written, but the
results so far arc of interest not
only because of their accomplish
ments to date but also because of
their implications. Great progress
has been made in the use of plas
ma or resuspended red blood cells
in place of whole blood for certain
types of transfusion needs.
In plasma research, the develop
ment of frozen and dried plasma has
greatly increased the length of time
which the plasma can be stored
without deterioration. The chief use
of plasma for both military and ci
vilian cases is in the treatment of
shock. Plasma injection causes an
increase in blood volume by pulling
water from the body cells into the
blood stream. Serum albumin, the
most abundant protein in plasma, has
been prepared as a more stable and
much more concentrated substitute
for plasma. Plasma and its constit
uents also promise to help in the
treatmnt of infectious diseases.
