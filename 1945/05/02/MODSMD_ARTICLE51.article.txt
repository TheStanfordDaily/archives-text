# Clowns To Appear At Frosh Bigtop
## 
### 
Join the crowd and come to the
circus! Laugh at the clowns and
scream at the wild animals Satur
day nii*ht at the Frosh Bigtop. Tick
ets, which according to reports are
selling fast, can be purchased at the
ASSU office for $2.40.
The freshman formal, an all-cam
pus event, will feature the music of
Maurice Anger's ten-piece band.
This band has been imported from
the St. Francis and Claremont ho
tels. Anger is well known to many
Stanford students as a very good
musician.
A new addition to the decorating
plans is a tent which is to stand at
the entrance of the Pavilion. Ac
cording to Joe Pickering, chairman
of the Frosh decoration committee,
the Bigtop had to have a tent to
pitch. A loud-mouthed barker will
greet guests in the traditional circus
manner.

The dance bids will carry out this
circus theme. They are tiny tents
and were designed by Illie Costigan.
The bids will be distributed at the
door, or tent entrance, Saturday
night.
It has just been announced by
Gordon Levy, president of the fresh
man class, that part of the proceeds
of the dance will go to the Con Home
drive. As originally planned the
freshmen were to keep the profit
they made on their event. However
the frosh excom has decided to join
the drive in spite of the expenses the
dance is incurring.
"For lots of color and fun, come
to the Frosh Bigtop," states Jan
Lamb, co-chairman of the decoration
committee. Miss Lamb assures ev
eryone that the atmosphere of the
dance will be authentic, and, she
adds, the food will be free.
