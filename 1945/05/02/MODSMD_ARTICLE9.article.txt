## Binns Good, Says Bailey Famed Steinbeck Style Shown in College Work 
### 
Speaking to an enthusiastic Tues
day Evening Scries audience com
posed largely of students, Dr. Mar
gery Bailey, associate professor of
English, last night traced the writing
development of several former Stan
ford students, now well-known au
thors.
"You cannot teach a man to write.
You can only direct him away from
his errors," she declared in her talk,
"Some Stanford Writers." She il
lustrated this point by reading some
of the early work of such authors as
John Steinbeck, Archie Binns, Bruce
Bliven, Robert Duffus, and Will Ir
win, showing how their writing then
reflected the ideas of the times, and
was in many cases imitative of the
best writers of their day.
Stcinhcck Least Altered
In a critical comparison of Stein
beck's work then and now, Dr. Bai
ley said that, unlike many authors,
the tone of his early writing has not
altered greatly with the years. She
read one of his early short stories,
"fairly representative of John Stein
beck's mind and feeling," which dis
played much of the "frank and fear
less realism and the uneasy curiosity
of the morbid" which marks much of
his work today.
"Although Steinbeck was not so
social-minded in those days, and al
though his writing resulted mainly
from observation," Dr. Bailey de
clared, "he showed the ,same liking
to write about people with odd
minds or no minds, and he showed
the same love of oddities, and vio
lence —with the overplay of senti
ment over violence—that is charac
teristic of Steinbeck's present work."
Dramatists Preserve Work
Dr. Bailey read the selections from
"Stanford Writers, 1891-1941," a
compilation of the best products of
early Stanford writers, which was
published by the Dramatists' Alli
ance of the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation in honor of the University's
birthday celebration.
Archie Binns, she said, was older
when he came to Stanford, having
spent three years at sea to earn the
money for a college education. In
the quiet drama of his short story,
"Logs," parts of which Dr. Bailey
read, he achieved work that is "not
exactly a story of the vengeance of
the logs and is not exactly realistic
. . . but something beautiful in be
tween."
The Best 'Social Story'
Calling "Logs" excellent, she said
that the "best sort of propaganda or
social story is valuable because of
the amount of restraint and sim
plicity used in telling it."
Dr. Bailey deplored the decline of
literary expression at present-day
Stanford, saying that when the Uni
versity was supposed to be a voca- '
tional school it gave far more en
couragement to student writers,
through the medium of campus lit
erary magazines, than it docs today.
"Next year," she said, "Dr. Wal
lace Stegncr is coming to Stanford to
head, I hope, a sort of sub-depart
ment of writing." She said that she
felt he wouid be a stimulation to
undergraduate literary expression.
She declared that there must be a
medium for mankind to speak him
self, and that this expression shows
the development of true culture.
"For," she concluded, "if we have
n't got living culture in the Univer
sity, then it has not accomplished its
mission."

minds or no minds, and he showed
the same love of oddities, and vio
lence —with the overplay of senti
ment over violence—that is charac
teristic of Steinbeck's present work."
Dramatists Preserve Work
Dr. Bailey read the selections from
"Stanford Writers, 1891-1941," a
compilation of the best products of
early Stanford writers, which was
published by the Dramatists' Alli
ance of the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation in honor of the University's
birthday celebration.
Archie Binns, she said, was older
when he came to Stanford, having
spent three years at sea to earn the
money for a college education. In
the quiet drama of his short story,
"Logs," parts of which Dr. Bailey
read, he achieved work that is "not
exactly a story of the vengeance of
the logs and is not exactly realistic
. . . but something beautiful in be
tween."
The Best 'Social Story'
Calling "Logs" excellent, she said
that the "best sort of propaganda or
social story is valuable because of
the amount of restraint and sim
plicity used in telling it."
Dr. Bailey deplored the decline of
literary expression at present-day
Stanford, saying that when the Uni
versity was supposed to be a voca- '
tional school it gave far more en
couragement to student writers,
through the medium of campus lit
erary magazines, than it docs today.
"Next year," she said, "Dr. Wal
lace Stegncr is coming to Stanford to
head, I hope, a sort of sub-depart
ment of writing." She said that she
felt he wouid be a stimulation to
undergraduate literary expression.
She declared that there must be a
medium for mankind to speak him
self, and that this expression shows
the development of true culture.
"For," she concluded, "if we have
n't got living culture in the Univer
sity, then it has not accomplished its
mission."
Speaking to an enthusiastic Tues
day Evening Scries audience com
posed largely of students, Dr. Mar
gery Bailey, associate professor of
English, last night traced the writing
development of several former Stan
ford students, now well-known au
thors.
"You cannot teach a man to write.
You can only direct him away from
his errors," she declared in her talk,
"Some Stanford Writers." She il
lustrated this point by reading some
of the early work of such authors as
John Steinbeck, Archie Binns, Bruce
Bliven, Robert Duffus, and Will Ir
win, showing how their writing then
reflected the ideas of the times, and
was in many cases imitative of the
best writers of their day.
Stcinhcck Least Altered
In a critical comparison of Stein
beck's work then and now, Dr. Bai
ley said that, unlike many authors,
the tone of his early writing has not
altered greatly with the years. She
read one of his early short stories,
"fairly representative of John Stein
beck's mind and feeling," which dis
played much of the "frank and fear
less realism and the uneasy curiosity
of the morbid" which marks much of
his work today.
"Although Steinbeck was not so
social-minded in those days, and al
though his writing resulted mainly
from observation," Dr. Bailey de
clared, "he showed the ,same liking
to write about people with odd
minds or no minds, and he showed
the same love of oddities, and vio
lence —with the overplay of senti
ment over violence—that is charac
teristic of Steinbeck's present work."
