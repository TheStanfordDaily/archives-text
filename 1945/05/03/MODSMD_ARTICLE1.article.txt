PARIS, May 2 (UP). â€”The war in
Europe roared toward an end to
night as British forces drove SO miles
to the Baltic without opposition, en
tering Luebcck amid a general dis
integration of the enemy and the
German commander, in Italy sur
rendered the entire battleground to
the U.S. Seventh Army in the Aus
trian panhandle.
The German capital of Berlin was
captured by the Russians after 12
days of vicious street fighting as the
entire German line from the Baltic
to the Mediterranean crumbled
swiftly toward complete collapse.
Lieut. Gen. Sir Miles G. Dempscy's
plunge to the Baltic drove miles
east of Luebcck to Wismar, reaching
within 28 miles of joining the Sec
