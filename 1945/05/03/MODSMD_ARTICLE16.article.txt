Studies Symposium today.
Dr. Williams will begin his talk,
"American Map Making Since Pearl
Harbor," at 4:15 in the lower lounge
of the Women's Clubhouse.
To Discuss Map Development
He will attempt to draw an over
all picture of the development of
maps in the modern rela
tion to aviation, and will point out
the modern development of pro
jection used in new global maps. He
will evaluate the work of Edes Har
rison, cartographer for "Life,"
"Time," and "Fortune," and will il
lustrate these.
Giving examples of European
methods and recent American work,
Dr. Williams will also evaluate the
present system of representation of
! topography on physical maps.
Maps Have Been Published
"Anyone who has seen the special
global maps featured some time ago
in "Life" magazine will understand
j the radical difference a new projec
j tion will make in one's concept of
distances on earth," lie said.
Stanford University Press lias
published a series of Dr. Williams'
outline maps of the polar world;
Schwabacher-Frey has published a
series, and J. L. Delkin a series.

University of Vienna. He has been
