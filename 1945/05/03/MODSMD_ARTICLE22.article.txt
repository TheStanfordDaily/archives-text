# 'Earnest' Comedy Termed Delightful
## 
### NANCY TILDEN 
The Stanford Players last night
in a highly successful "penthouse"
staging of "The Importance of Being
Earnest" turned in a performance as

engagingly dc -
tailed and en -
.irely delightful
as the artificial
rose bushes in
round pink pots
ihat squared the
second act scene
with precis e
grace.
In an evening
that kept the
first night audi
ence continually
tittering behind
their programs
when they were
no t guffawing

outright, it is hard to name any one
performance as better than another,
but if anyone stole the show it was
Murray Stirton as the engagingly
outspoken spinster backbone of
Manor Mouse.
Stirton Wins 'Clap-olT'
Ilcr by-play with the "perpetual
temptation" to spinsterly humanity,
the celibate Canon Chasuble, as
played by Martin Nalder, brought
her the rumbling appreciation of the
audience and the only "clap-ofT" of
the evening.
Among the leads Maggie Morgan
as Earnest's young country ward,
who takes down her lover's proposal
by dictation in her diary, and John
ny High as the man-about-town who
goes country wooing under the ex
cuse of seeing an invalid uncle by
tlie name of Bunbcrry and eats
quantities of tea biscuits, turned in,
as usually, the most finished and
lively performances of the evening.
What superoority they and Miss
Stirton showed over the rest of the
cast lay in their ability to get. the
spirit of the characters and situations
of the Oscar Wilde parody as well
as the brilliantly clever dialogue.
William Melton as Jack, or Ear
nest, as you will, though catching
! on the whole the properly "car
| nest" nature of his eharactcriza
j tion. had a tendency to be over
awed by the brilliance of his lines
and to rely upon them and not
their meaning for his effect.
Welch Plays Lady Bracknell
Barbara Welch as the eminently
proper and clever Ladv Bracknell
had plums aplenty for lines and gave
them and the woman behind them
her usually careful and effective
character-delineation, but there was
i a slight sense of hurry in her de

livery which often left the audience
panting considerably behind the
point.
Lorna Robertson as the modish
Gwendolyn with her passion for the
"vibrating" Christian name of Ear
nest gave a performance quite up to
the full potentialities of the role,
which is to say she kept the audi
ence quite delighted.
Direction Excellent
Largest bouquet of the evening
should go to Norman IMiilbrick and
Wendell Cole for the thoroughly
careful and continually lively di
rection. Also whoever is respon
sible for properties and staging—
in particular the artificial rose
bushes and the pink chairs with
their "tatted" balls—merits the en
chanted gratitude of the audience
for catching concretely the sense
of exaggerated parody which
makes up (lie charm of Wilde's
play.
Charles Smurr as Lane, the cynical
butler, and Merriman, the announcer
of "Pony-cart at the door, sir," ef
fected not only the proper fulfillment
of their parts in the play, but a
straight face changing of scenes, in
chiding "rolling out the grass," pre
cisely in tune with the mock-scrious
feel of the evening.
But to return to what made
Murry Stirton's performance, and
Martin Naldcr's in lesser degree,
stand out even above the excellent
performances of the rest of the
cast, it seemed that while everyone
else filled more than adequately
the play's demand for delightful
parody, there was something in
the energy and confidence of Miss
Stirton's performance that con
vinced the audience she and her
celibate temptation, Canon Chasu
ble, were not parodies at all but
people, who had wandered into
one by accident.
There were moments when Mag
gie Morgan in her exuberant enjoy
ment. of "Earnest's" wickedness
caught much the same quality. Her
scenes with Johnny High were u
sort of second high point to those
between Miss Prism and Canon
Chasuble.
The entirely satisfactory thrcc-in
onc clinch at curtain time was
played to best advantage by two
"touching tableaus" that served as
curtain falls and closed quite cor
rectly ihe Wilde parody.
For an evening of sophisticated
and yet constantly live entertain
ment this reviewer can only go out
on a limb by insisting this is the
best work the Stanford Players have
done this year.
