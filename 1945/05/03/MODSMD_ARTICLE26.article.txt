# Voto Power and the Result

Thf extremely intelligent manner in which the
re] i jsentatives of India have handled them
selves in America is perhaps one of the most
encouraging signs in current public affairs.
The people of India, give all indications of be
ing as firmly convinced of their own potentiali
ties to govern themselves, and have worked
as hard for their liberation as any of the people,
including ourselves, who have struggled for
freedom.
f.'ir:-:. Pandit, sister of the Indian leader, Nehru,
is proving to be a wonderful exemplification of
their suavity in presenting their cause in this
country.
r lh plight ol India seems to be a pretty one
sided one, just recently on campus two esteem
ed visitors, certainly men with no reason to be
swayed without reason to either side, Dr. Mum
by and Mr. Horace G. Alexander, strongly de
fended the position of the party seeking libera
tion for India.
It is a great tendency of Americans to go off
on a tangent about India, completely forgetting
thai our Negro problem seems quite as easily
solvable lo the average Britain, as their Indian
problem lo us.
One thing that has wider implications for us
is the predicament for India in the future. For
instance, in San Francisco we are setting up ma
chinery to effect jusiice in the world without re
sort to arms. How will this machinery be able
to fit into the pattern of revolt that can be fore
seen in the predicament of India?
jVi;s. Pandit said that Ghanai and Nehru have
Jiot advocated violence of any sort, but the
younger and the coming leaders of India are
more impatient and see that few benefits have
rome from programs of non-violence.
The Dumbarton Oaks machinery would make
i! impossible for India to gain freedom, as long
as Britain, as a major power, has the right, by its
single veto vote, to make a resolution fail.
f\'j ma tier how we regard the single issue of
India, though it is indicative of how the weight
of evidence can be extremely one-sided, this
situation certainly shows how little actual power
ihe organisation will have, to work for peace.
The league of nations could, at least, have a
measure passed to use sanctions against a major
power, but the veto power of major nations
would paralyze the new organization.
It is too true that there cannot be peace if just
one of the major powers is in disagreement with
the policy of all the nations as a whole.
This question is vital to the need that has been
declared time and again since the last war for
stronger action against acts detrimental to jus
tice throughout the world.
If the organization is going to have power to
act for justice, to influence powerful nations in
the common interest of world peace, to enforce
sanctions, and present unity for justice behind
the facts, the veto power for a single major na
tion is a bad proposal.
The organization of "united nations" must be
able to take a courageous stand, and if the ma
chinery does not even provide the means, the
wisdom of many statesmen can be to no avail.
