Soon (he United Nations must find an international
' i! lot' their organization. Th'j site to be chosen should
I;! located within the territory of any particular
)!. ion. Preferably the site ought to be international,
iii ilie same manner as (he District of Columbia in our
112 . .intry is not a part of a state but an independent dis
trict In such an international site there would he less
iii.clihood of perverse international politics, as (his
: pot would belong equally to all nations.
Hawaii would he the i<le;i| location for the New
World organization. By air this island is located equally
distant from all capitals of (he world. J) is situaled
r>00:) miles from Chungking, 5,000 miles from Moscow,

and 5,000 miles from London. If the world capital were
located at (his spot, no diplomat would be obliged to
travel farther than another, which is only just, as trav
eling involves so much expense and effort that no na
tion should be obliged to contribute more than an
other.
This island has excellent military fortifications and
would be only suitable lor international armed forces.
From here the world army and navy would be equally
distant from all important areas that must be policed.
Never would the world army or navy be obliged to
travel unduly long distances to an area of dispute, as
the case might be if the World Organization were lo
cated in Switzerland and was suddenly obliged to
put down a dispute in Japan.
The climate in Hawaii is excellent, without extremes
or periods of discomlort.
The United Stater, might present Hawaii to the
United Nations as an international island belonging
lo all the nations, where peace would be everlastingly
presi rvrd. The American people who are sick of war
and desire peace woidd not object too greatly to this
sacrifice of national territory, for in their present state
of mind they will do anything favorable to peace.
The United States, it is true, would be giving up an
important defense bastion; however the much stronger
armed forces of the United Nations would even better
guard our .shores.
In the meantime the United States would have mili
tary bases much farther west at Guam and other Far
Eastern islands.
We either have faith in an international organiza
tion to keep the peace, and hence the World Police
Force, or we have faith in national militaiism. Surely
we will have sufficient faith in the new world organi
zation to make this sacrifice.
In Hawaii numerous foreign populations, in par
ticular Oriental, are predominant. If we make such
a generous gesture with our territory, at the same time
giving these people some semblance of self-govern
ment, we shall give a powerful example to other Or
iental and foreign peoples of the word under domina
tion of imperialistic powers. The Indian people, for
instance, will take notice of this, and England will be
obliged to give them their freedom.
Of course buildings to house the International Or
ganization would have to be constructed; however
this would not prove too significant a problem. Un
questionably Hawaii, an island of peace, would be wor
thy as a nucleus for a world of peace.
