# Seen from an Ivory Tower

### 
The instinct for collecting is so deeply ingrained in
human nature that it requires the utmost exercise of
philosophy to prevent a man amassing an unmanage
able heap of personal property.
The position of being an owner operates in two
directions; the possessor owns and is owned by his
property. 'As its physical volume increases it acts
as an anchor that hampers his freedom in moving
from one house to another. As its financial worth
increases it begins to offer responsibilities and to con
sume time. Such considerations cannot l»e denied
yet they are outweighed hy the urge to own ma
terial objects.
It is futile to point out, as lias been done by some
austere thinkers, that man cannot hope to own any
thing, that his transitory period of existence means
that only a lease o (property is possible. Ownership
is an emotional feeling and it is strong enough to give
a satisfaction that is not affected by these sober re
flections.
It would appear, however, that to bound the period
of ownership by the length of a lifetime is still an over
statement. Some research on this subject has been con
ducted by the insatiable research-hounds who are now
putting every subject to the quantitative measure. They
have discovered that, on the average, an article of
personal property stays only ten years in the hands of
any one owner.
Within ten years that new fishing rod, that antique
chair, that prized autograph portrait or rare first
edition will have passed out of your possession and
(tut of your ken. The little material object that
looms so large in your mind today, that comes as a
warmly comforting image into your early morning
day-dreams, is shortly to he replaced in your affec
tion by some other glittering object equally as im
portant and equally as transient.
There is on occasion something sad and something
intensely personal about the results of research, even
when scientifically conducted. It is true that the mech
anism of research, the endless questionnaires to be
analyzed, the intricate statistical equations to be de
veloped, tested and applied, the pages of closely
printed tabulation, is enough to frighten any human
feeling and send it scurrying for shelter behind a wall
of scorn. Hut here the result of the research carries
its message of the fickleness of affection and the vari
ability of taste; at last something that is human and
understandable.
(If course it did not need much research in the
case just quoted to verify what every intelligent ob
server of mankind knows already. Hut in its painful
way research lias to go over the ground slowly and
cautiously, where the individual has previously made
his intuitive leaps. Holh have reached the same con
clusion.
In time, by dint of plodding and calling on vast
amount:; of exp< rimental data, science hopes to be able
to push a few steps beyond what has -been done by even
th( most, gifted single person. Some time in the future
we may hope that our researchers in the social sciences
will be able to tell us things that we had not discov
ered for ourselves in advance.

directions; the possessor owns and is owned by his
property. 'As its physical volume increases it acts
as an anchor that hampers his freedom in moving
from one house to another. As its financial worth
increases it begins to offer responsibilities and to con
sume time. Such considerations cannot l»e denied
yet they are outweighed hy the urge to own ma
terial objects.
It is futile to point out, as lias been done by some
austere thinkers, that man cannot hope to own any
thing, that his transitory period of existence means
that only a lease o (property is possible. Ownership
is an emotional feeling and it is strong enough to give
a satisfaction that is not affected by these sober re
flections.
It would appear, however, that to bound the period
of ownership by the length of a lifetime is still an over
statement. Some research on this subject has been con
ducted by the insatiable research-hounds who are now
putting every subject to the quantitative measure. They
have discovered that, on the average, an article of
personal property stays only ten years in the hands of
any one owner.
Within ten years that new fishing rod, that antique
chair, that prized autograph portrait or rare first
edition will have passed out of your possession and
(tut of your ken. The little material object that
looms so large in your mind today, that comes as a
warmly comforting image into your early morning
day-dreams, is shortly to he replaced in your affec
tion by some other glittering object equally as im
portant and equally as transient.
There is on occasion something sad and something
intensely personal about the results of research, even
when scientifically conducted. It is true that the mech
anism of research, the endless questionnaires to be
analyzed, the intricate statistical equations to be de
veloped, tested and applied, the pages of closely
printed tabulation, is enough to frighten any human
feeling and send it scurrying for shelter behind a wall
of scorn. Hut here the result of the research carries
its message of the fickleness of affection and the vari
ability of taste; at last something that is human and
understandable.
(If course it did not need much research in the
case just quoted to verify what every intelligent ob
server of mankind knows already. Hut in its painful
way research lias to go over the ground slowly and
cautiously, where the individual has previously made
his intuitive leaps. Holh have reached the same con
clusion.
In time, by dint of plodding and calling on vast
amount:; of exp< rimental data, science hopes to be able
to push a few steps beyond what has -been done by even
th( most, gifted single person. Some time in the future
we may hope that our researchers in the social sciences
will be able to tell us things that we had not discov
ered for ourselves in advance.

The instinct for collecting is so deeply ingrained in

philosophy to prevent a man amassing an unmanage
