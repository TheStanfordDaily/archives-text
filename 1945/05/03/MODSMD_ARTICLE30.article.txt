A now island campaign for the control of Borneo, and
thus probably the East Indies, seems to have opened up.
This is an excellent preparatory stroke for further op
erations in the Pacific, and makes it possible to conduct
th-ise operations on a larger scale than hitherto.
The conquest of Romeo first of all produces oil. The
supply is so good that the most crude refining will ex
trad gasoline from it. This chops a figure oIT the
length of miles which we have to carry fuel to our
Pacific outposts.
Secondly, the capture of Borneo puts us right next
door to Sumatra, and the capture of it would net us the
Straits of Malacca. The Japanese hold here would be
reduced to the tapering southern end of the Malay
States, which is a bulge, and an amphibious operation
can easily turn it into a sack.
Thirdly, the conquest of the Indies completely neu
tralizes Indo-China, Siam, and Burma. How can the
( ncmy supply them with our air forces over his com
munication routes, and Chinese guerillas constantly
dynani'ling his rail lines? The twisting Chinese
mountain "roads" with their hair pin curves would
be hardly adequate unless enemy engineers can im
prove (hem in the next year, and by then it might he
too late.
Fourthly, we are now capable of attacking Asia from
any direction and any place along its perimeter. We
have an entangling, strangling net of pressure forcing
the Japanese to tie down troops on hopeless frontages,
making it easier for us when we decide to strike.
Fourthly, and perhaps most important, the control of
this area will cut the shipping distance for our troops
in Europe in half, once they are ready to move into the
A iatic theater of operations.
