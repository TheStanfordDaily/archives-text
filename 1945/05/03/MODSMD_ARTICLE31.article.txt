## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
Besides being chairman of the com
mittee which is planning the 50 year
reunion this year of the "Pioneer
Class," Charles K. Field, '95, and old
est living alumnus of the Speech and
Drama Department, has come back
to Stanford to live so he can give
whatever he can for the boys at Dib
ble Hospital.
Dibble Hospital is building a cen
tral microphone studio with ear
phones at every bed. Patients can
listen to the radio this way, and Mr.
Field is helping to put on radio shows
for them right at Dibble.
Was NBC "Cheerio"
Mr. Field's 15 years experience as
"Cheerio" over N. B. C. has equipped
him lor his work. He began this pro
gram in 1925 in San Francisco to give
mental and spiritual setting-up ex
ercises for invalids. Herbert Hoover
heard the program and asked him to
go East.
He then began broadcasting his
programs from New York, and when
he retired in 1940, he had 85 stations
coast to coast.
' With this experience behind me
and since I have nothing else to do,
1 want to help the boys at Dibble in
this way," he said. "No returning
alumnus could be happier than to be
sort of a liaison officer between his
favorite department (Speech and
Drama) and such an opportunity as
there is at Dibble."
Farm Departments Help
Many of Stanford's departments
are tying in with the work to be done
at Dibble. The speech and micro
phone technique of the Department
of Speech and Drama ties in nicely
with Mr. Field's work there. Other
departments are helping to instruct
the men in the fields in which they
are interested, according to Mr. Field.
On the side, Mr. Field and his com
mittee are sending out invitations to
the "Pioneer Class" of '95, the first
class to graduate from Stanford after
attending four years, and the three
classes above and below this class to
attend the graduation exercises of the
class of '45 and the reunion of his
class this June. Because of wartime
conditions the reunion cannot be na
tion-wide, but will be regional in
stead.
'Oldtimers' Invited
"Any 'old-timer' who is in this vi
cinity at the time of the reunion is
invited to be the guest of the Univer
sity," Mr. Field said.
"When I graduated from Stanford
I hated to leave," he said, "And I re
solved never to lose contact with the
'Farm.'" Now coming back 50 years
later, having known many new peo
ple, I still feel at home here."
Mr. Field was Stanford's first, poet
and in 1899 his book of Stanford
rhymes entitled "Four Leaved Clo
ver" was published. It was introduc
ed by Dr. David Starr Jordan who
said it was a part of the Farm's tra
ditions.
Reads Poems at Assembly
"In 1924, I gave an author's reading
of the poems at an assembly here and
the audience reacted to them as if
they had been written the day be
fore," he said.
He also wrote the first play to be
presented at Stanford which was
called "A Meeting of the Faculty"
and was presented in 1892. He was
author, too, of the first Junior Farce.
In 1921, he established "Un ivcrsity
Day" which was an annual tradition
until this war broke out. On this day
all the trustees and alumni came back
and saw the campus going in "ful
steam." The faculty and students
were hosts and the four-way cele
bration was held in the spring of the
year.
Held During Track Meet
In alternate years "University
Day" was held when the track meet
was here. "I established this dav be

cause when alums came back at com
mencement time under the old sem
ester system, the campus was dead,''

he said. "This gave all the 'old-timers'
a chance to see the campus in activi
ty"
In 1941, Mr. Field was in charge of
ihe great 50th birthday celebration
that was held in Inner Quad. The
Drama Department reproduced the
opening exercises of the University
and Mr. Field showed his lantern
slides of the first buildings.
Sings Duet with Classmate
Shirley Baker, his old classmate
and glee club star, sang a duet with :
Mr. Field at a student leader's lun- 1
cheon. The next day Charlie Bull,
editor of the Daily, brought him an
editorial which was to be published
entitled, "Two Grand Old Men."
"We were very much touched and j
thought it was an excellent joke on I
us," he laughed.
After graduating from Stanford, |

Company and was editor of "Sunset"
Magazine before going into broad- [
casting.

great-grandfather, grandfather, and
father. He has a little theater in the
barn and is in charge of the Field

well-equipped with microphones and
other dramatic equipment.
"I have leased a room at a house
on Alvarado Row for the 'rest of my
natural life'," he said. ''I am doing
the work I want to do in helping the
Dibble boys, and am living in the
place I love hest."

programs from New York, and when
he retired in 1940, he had 85 stations
coast to coast.
' With this experience behind me
and since I have nothing else to do,

sort of a liaison officer between his
favorite department (Speech and
Drama) and such an opportunity as
there is at Dibble."
Farm Departments Help
Many of Stanford's departments
are tying in with the work to be done
at Dibble. The speech and micro

with Mr. Field's work there. Other
departments are helping to instruct
the men in the fields in which they
are interested, according to Mr. Field.
On the side, Mr. Field and his com
mittee are sending out invitations to
the "Pioneer Class" of '95, the first
class to graduate from Stanford after
attending four years, and the three
classes above and below this class to
attend the graduation exercises of the
class of '45 and the reunion of his
class this June. Because of wartime

stead.
'Oldtimers' Invited
"Any 'old-timer' who is in this vi
cinity at the time of the reunion is
invited to be the guest of the Univer
sity," Mr. Field said.
"When I graduated from Stanford
I hated to leave," he said, "And I re
solved never to lose contact with the
'Farm.'" Now coming back 50 years
later, having known many new peo
ple, I still feel at home here."
Mr. Field was Stanford's first, poet
and in 1899 his book of Stanford
rhymes entitled "Four Leaved Clo
ver" was published. It was introduc
ed by Dr. David Starr Jordan who
said it was a part of the Farm's tra
ditions.
Reads Poems at Assembly
"In 1924, I gave an author's reading
of the poems at an assembly here and
the audience reacted to them as if
they had been written the day be
fore," he said.
He also wrote the first play to be
presented at Stanford which was
called "A Meeting of the Faculty"
and was presented in 1892. He was
author, too, of the first Junior Farce.
In 1921, he established "Un ivcrsity
Day" which was an annual tradition
until this war broke out. On this day
all the trustees and alumni came back
and saw the campus going in "ful
steam." The faculty and students
were hosts and the four-way cele
bration was held in the spring of the
year.
Held During Track Meet
In alternate years "University
Day" was held when the track meet
was here. "I established this dav be

cause when alums came back at com
mencement time under the old sem
ester system, the campus was dead,''

he said. "This gave all the 'old-timers'
a chance to see the campus in activi
ty"
In 1941, Mr. Field was in charge of
ihe great 50th birthday celebration
that was held in Inner Quad. The
Drama Department reproduced the
opening exercises of the University
and Mr. Field showed his lantern
slides of the first buildings.
Sings Duet with Classmate
Shirley Baker, his old classmate
and glee club star, sang a duet with :
Mr. Field at a student leader's lun- 1
cheon. The next day Charlie Bull,
editor of the Daily, brought him an

"We were very much touched and j
thought it was an excellent joke on I
us," he laughed.
