### LISA EBBERTS 
Editorial Note: This is the sixth in our series of articles on Stanford's
present and postwar outlook.
Dr. H. Donald Winbigler is enthusiastic about Stanford, and he gives a
good many reasons for his admiration. He arrived in 1940 to become Asso
ciate Registrar and Academic Secretary, and was impressed at once by the
Stanford spirit.

Hi' likes the attractive campus
and the friendly informal people
who live here. He lilies our Honor
Code, and our freedom from re
strictions and regulation. lie is im
pressed with our self sufficient col
lege community. And he has al
ways admired our keen interna
tional interest in far-away people
and places.
Most of all, he likes our miraculous
mixture of old and new, the vigor of
a new college combined wilh the
pride of traditions. So many new col
legos have vigor, but lack a certain
richness and polish. So many old col
leges are weighed down by their out
moded traditions.
We have a college that people hate
to leave. More than one faculty mem
ber has refused a much higher salary
at some other school.
I)r. Winbigler admits that we
need improvements, ''just as any
growing school", lie Names many
needs on the dislocations of war,
such as our reduced enrollment
and absence of faculty in war ser
vices. lit? looks forward to normal
times and expansion.
He feels that our prewar student
body was the ideal size, but hopes for
the addition and return of many dis
tinguished teachers.
Our physical resources have
many gaps, he said. We need a new
Union and Faculty Club and room
for visiting parents and friends to
spend the night. We should build
comfortable houses for graduates
in the postwar period, particularly
married ones. And every depart
ment on campus wants more class
and laboratory space.
Stanford is on the move, says Dr.
Winbigler. Our leaders have excel
lent judgment, and the school has a
reputation that attracts good people.
Our gift procurement program is
rapidly increasing. "Stanford can't
miss."
