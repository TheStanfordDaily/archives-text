Well, it has finally happened; we
are going to get some Naval R.O.T.C
students in November and then
nothing in the world is going to
keep us from returning to inter
collegiate athletics. This has been
the best news to reach Stanford for
many quarters, but will mean noth
ing unless we take full advantage of
it.
The spirit at Stanford is sadly
lacking. Except for an occasional
rally or meeting, there has been
very little to bring the students
together. Slowly, however, Stan
ford students have been taking the
problem in their own hands and
bringing back their own answer.
The Palo Alto Independent basket
hall team started it rolling; the
Palo Alto Independent baseball
team is keeping it going; and the
individual efforts of a great many
Stanford athletes are furthering
its progress.
Now, when full-scale athletics will
return, we students have a perfect
opportunity to get back into the
swing of it, and really be ready to
stand behind our teams. The change
over will be quick; we must be
ready for it.
Many of us have forgotten what
a Stanford team looks like; many
of us have never known. For too
many years we have not had the op
pprtunity to find out, but we have
had the opportunity to see our ath
letes in action. Many of us have ne
glected that opportunity. We must
always remember that a team is just
what its players make it.
The P.A.I, baseball team is play
ing Fleet City tomorrow in what
should be a top game. Fleet City
is headed by Harvey Storey and
Eddie Fernandez and is considered
to be one of the best nines in the
Bay area. The Independents are led
by "Doc" Mason, regular hurler for
the last official Stanford baseball
squad and one of the best collegiated
pitchers on the Coast. He is ably
backed up by veterans Torn Ashley.
Bob Rosburg, Tom Hood, and others.
If Stanford were participating in in
ter-collegiate athletics, these men
would probably be the stars of the
Stanford nine.
Next Satu/day, in Golden Gate
Park, three Stanford students are
entering the Bay County Cham
pionships in tennis. In the men's
division is John Brock, once fourth
ranking junior doubles champion
of the United States. Brock is one
of the outstanding tennis stars of
California and has not been de
feated since he has been at Stan
ford.
Eugene Corman and Gil Seaton
arc entering the Junior Singles and
Doubles tournaments. Seaton is an
ex-Southern California Interschol
astic doubles champ, while Cor
man was seventh ranking in sin
gles. Since coming to Stanford,
Corman has improved tremen
dously and is seeded very high in
the coming tournament. Both were
stars on their Beverly High squads.
And if that isn't enough, there are
still some tracksters on campus who
showed the nation a few weeks ago
that Stanford is still tops in track.
Ed Luce is number one high-jumper
on the Coast, and probably one of

the best in the country. As yet, no
one has come even near his mark,
and he has just begun. Gordon Levy,
who took both dashes in the U.C.
Invitational meet two weeks ago is
steadily improving. Watch him for
more spectacular upsets.
Every student has a chance and a
duty to root for these athletes who
are giving up their time to keep the
spirit going. They might not wear
Stanford uniforms, but they will go
flown on the records as some of
Stanford's best; and when Stanford
does resume sports, you can be sure
that they will be leading Ihe teams.
These arc the men that will
make U.C., U.S.C., and all the
other Coast schools wish that
Stanford had not returned to ath
letics. Take advantage of your
good fortune; get behind them;
give them encouragement; cheer
them on to victory.
They will be the ones that are
leading Stanford to victory.
