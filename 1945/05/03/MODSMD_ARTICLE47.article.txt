# Ground School Class Tonight
## 
### 
Is that a cold front, altostratus
cloud, or California sunshine? Are
you going east, west, or upside
down? Run to the ground school
lessons at Palo Alto High School to
night and every Thursday night at
7:15 if aeronautics and the wild blue
yonder is your secret ambition or
present hobby.
You will be greeted by the smiling
instructor from Pan-American Air
ways, ready to answer your ques
tions and fill you with knowledge on
navigation, meteorology, theory of
flight, and Civil Air Regulations.
The classes last two hours and will
prepare the students to take the
Civil Aeronautics examination if it's
that private license that's wanted.
Tonight's class will be on naviga
tion. Two Thursday nights will be
devoted to each of the remaining
subjects with a possible review class
at the end of the course.
