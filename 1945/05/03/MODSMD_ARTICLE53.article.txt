### BETTY BARLOW 
William Haw ley Davis, professor
of English and editor of the Univer
sity Press, who lias been active in
leaching and press publications
work for the past twenty years, will
retire this year, on August 21, at the
end of his term.

Although his work ut the Univer
sity Press took most of his time Pro
fessor Davis taught required and
elective English and literature
courses. His favorite course was on
Thomas Carlyle. He stated that most
of hi.s literature classes were very
small, for students neglected Car
lyle and Emerson. There has been
a surprisingly sustained interest in
the course on Arthurian legends
which, according to Professor Davis,
is due to their widespread fame.
Kditor in 1D2.1
The relationship with students and
faculty was important to Professor
Davis as editor of the Press, for he
was in a better position to suggest
changes and deal with the work of
his colleagues.
In 1925 when Professor Davis be
came editor of the University Press
it was not a publishing institution,
and there was no special effort made

to sell books. Work was done only
for books by members of the faculty.
The Press then began to solicit man
uscripts and to promote and sell
books accepted for publication. The
first catalogue of the titles of pub
lished books was printed in 192(5. Of
all the manuscripts received, Pro
fessor Davis said that roughly only
one in every four was accepted. He
decides what books are to be re
jected, and tlie others are examined
by experts in the fields who arc
members of the faculty. Most of the
published books are in the field of
learning. No books on fiction, poetry,
or contemporary drama are accepted.
Plans Research
Professor Davis stated that his re
lations with authors, colleagues, and
members of the Press staff have been
interesting and stimulating and that
his work at Stanford for the past
years has been enjoyable.
He said that, he will take pleasure
in following the further develop
ments of the Press. Until alter the
war Professor Davis wants to en
gage in industry to relieve the man
power shortage, and then plans to
do research and writing. In his files
he has accumulated material for
about 3000 familiar figures of speech.
At present he has no plans in par
ticular for this information since
publishers are not interested in it as
a book.
Taught Army Students
Professor Davis did graduate and
undergraduate work at Harvard,
then taught at Columbia where he
completed the requirements for his
master's degree. Before coming to
Stanford he taught at the University
of Kansas and Bowdin College in
Maine. Last year when there was a
shortage in teachers for the Army
he taught algebra and trigonometry.
He has taught special courses of in
dividual study in the English de
partment and has also been a de
bating coach.
A number of professional articles
have been written by Professor Da
vis and printed in periodicals. He
has written one book, "The Eng
lish Essayist," which is now out of
print.
