# UNCIO Begins Peace Draft

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 2 (UP).â€”
The United Nations Conference to
day shelved major controversial
problems, including Poland, and set
to work in an atmosphere of Big
Three harmony to draft the charter
of the world security organization
designed to keep the postwar peace.
Only America will submit any ma
jor proposals for a change in the
Dumbarton Oaks agenda. One new
American proposal was understood
to be viewed favorably by the Rus
sians. This is a suggestion that a
two-thirds vote be required for ap
proval of amendments to Dumbarton
Oaks.
After the demonstration of hemi
spheric unity in the voting on the
Argentine question, the Russians re
gard the two-thirds requirement as
a partial protection against repeti
tion of such events in the future.
