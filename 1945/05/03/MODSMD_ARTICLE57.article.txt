# Fellowship Discusses Bible, Christian Life

### ROD BROWNING 
II was a warm Sunday evening in the year 1877. Over half the student
body of Cambridge University were assembled in the Holy Trinity Church
to see what this new experiment was that some of their fellow students
were starting. Mr. Stevenson Blackwood had been asked to address the
meeting that evening. He solemnly arose from his chair and began his speech
with the words, "I am going to speak â™¦

to you men on the true secret of hap
piness."
It was from this student movement
in 1877 at Cambridge University that
the present Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship grew. Oxford students
soon heard of the ovei'whelming suc
cess of this experiment at Cambridge,
and they formed a similar group at
Oxford.
War llulps Movement
By the end of the first World War,
the movement had surged rapidly
ahead, establishing chapters through
out Great Britain and Ireland. The
organization soon spread to Canada,
New Zealand, Australia, and India;
and early in 1939 the first chapter was
opened in the United States. Since
then 150 chapters have been formed
at various colleges and universities
all over this country, and many more
are just getting started.
An organization similar to Inter-
Varsity existed until 1942, here at
Stanford, under the name Stanford
Christian Fellowship. In the spring
of 1942 this organization joined the
international Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship.
Dr. Francis Russell, whose work in
Christianity has been world-wide, is
adviser for the Stanford group. Un
der the leadership of Marian Madden,
the group has met every Monday for
Bible discussion, and occasionally
has sponsored a social function.
Purpose Explained
The purpose of the Christian Fel
lowship is to provide a meeting
ground for Christian thought and life
or college and university campuses.
Bible classes are held at least once
a week to teach students the basic
principles of the Bible. The Stanford
group meets every Monday at 8 p.m.
in the Vestry Of the Memorial Chapel.
All those who can not manage to
get up early enough Sunday morning
to go to Church have the opportunity
to discuss Christianity on a more
personal basis at the Monday night
meetings. All students arc invited to
attend these meetings and see for
themselves how interesting and
worth while they arc.
