# Review KO's 'Pleasure' Film --No Pleasure
## 
### 
After "It's a Pleasure —which defi
nitely wasn't — "Ministry of Fear,"
also at the Stanford, looked like

Academy Award
bait.
Michael O'Shea
puffed through
nine reels, but it
was a slow leak
all the way, even
with the help of
technicolor and
Sonja Henie.
Fortunately, O'-
Shea faded out

through the middle of the picture
but they held it over your head that
he would return for the final clinch.
"Ministry of Fear" was sheer relief
in contrast. With fairly good sus
pense, it started out as a psycho
logical horror story and turned into
a Nazi versus Scotland Yard opus,
with Ray Milland in the middle.
The delicious looking country fair
cake turned out. to be strictly lethal,
as well as the bl'.nd man, the tailor
and a spooky seance sccne.
Everyone seemed to be against
Ray Milland, but the rest of London
finally came around to the viewpoint
of the audience, and Marjorie Rey
nolds. Much darkness, air raids, and
broken-down office buildings helped
the general tension, along with two
murders in the line of duty.
Occasional scenes seemed to be
lifted right from"The Uninvited,"
but it was exciting enough to keep
your interest up until Scotland Yard
finally came through — without the
aid of Sherlock Holmes, who seemed
to be about the only person not in
terested in the case by the last scene.
A scissors suicide and the usual
roof-top gunfire finally solved all the
complications. Your first hunch will
be right about who the 'brains" be
hind the Nazis is.—Ayres
