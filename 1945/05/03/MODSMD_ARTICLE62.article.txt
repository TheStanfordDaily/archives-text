"We wanted to show students what
a Chinese book looks like," smiled
Willard Johnson, reference librarian,
when questioned about the Univer

The exhibit was set up Monday by
Mr. Young and Dr. Mark H. S. Tseng,
library bibliographer, to illustrate the

Tseng is in charge.

Students interested in the exhibit
arc urged to examine the Stanford
Chinese collection of over 0.000 vol
umes covering a wide variety of sub

notable for being among the few in

valuable works, preserved by litho
graphing, include canonical works,
legends, customs, folklore, proverbs,
poems, and essays by China's fore
most authors of the past.
Li he Possesses These Works
"With the Stanford Library pos
sessing these fundamental works
their usefulness will be apparent
when they are made available for
use. The time is not far off when 'a
closer intellectual cooperation will
be established between the West and
the East which will facilitate the ex
change of ideas and foster under
standing", said Dr. Tseng.
Dr. Tseng came from China to at
tend Columbia University, from
which he graduated with his mas
ter's degree in 1937. He was affiliated
