## 
### 
Step right up, folks, to the Pavil
ion, where from 7:150 till 11:30 to
night the sophomores will present
ihcir annual carnival for the bene
fit of the Con Home. Thirty conces
sions, sponsored by campus living
groups, will compete for student
dimes, and in combination will guar
antee an evening of varied enter
tainment from popcorn to pop-guns.
To the tunes of the Army band,
Ruble women will taxi-dance the
evening away. Just 10 cents a
dance is the price to all comers.
Under the leadership of Johnny
Jenkins an eight-man committee has
enrolled, co-ordinated, and built
booths lor all groups participating.
From the sponsor groups, however,
have come the ideas and the sup
plies for putting on their portion of
the entertainment.
Mariposa, they say, will supply
freaks for its freak show—cast of
characters has been dreamed up and
costumed by Mariposa women. Ty
ler will supply its own rodents for
the "rat race," which remains a mys

tery to potential carnival-goers.
Union women will accept and de
liver telegrams all over the Pavil
ion, and, for a higher price, all over
campus. Five-minute sketches of all
I students who purchase tickets will
I be turned out by Elm women.
Residents of the Oaks will chal
lenge all comers to throw hoops over
i their limbs, which, according to
I chairman Pat Jones, will be dis-
J played through holes in a sheet, and
I clad in black mesh stockings.
Buchanan, utilizing its native pul
chritude, will show off its own Var
fia girls a show that returns to the
carnival after its hilarious staging
last year. Washington men will
sponsor a ski-ball game (no skis
allowed).
Cigarettes as prizes are the bait
i offered by the two Army booths,
! to be flanked by Storey House's
nail-pounding booth, and the con
cession of Cubberley House.
I Water games will drench all com
