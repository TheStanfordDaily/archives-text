# CONSTITUTIONALLY YOURS

### 
Though not many people realize it, and ear
nest citizens find themselves wondering if it
matters to anyone, every Stanford student finds
himself in a precarious position these days.
The possibilities for our future, fellow citi
zens, may include everything from building a
city rail a mile high and an inch square, to
abolishing the Chaparral, declaring the Boat
house out of bounds, or issuing a vole of con
fidence to the Nazi Party . . . little did you know,
but the very constitution under which we live
is in shambles and lying on the floor of the
Excorn room.
AIJ this rigamorole goes to say that the so
called "drifting through, till after the war" is
a mytli on this campus, unless people are mak
ing such a situation themselves.
flight now the ASSU constitution, relax now
(Messrs. Jefferson and Hamilton) is being re
wjilten. Recent practices have shown the tre
mendou:; lapses, inconsistencies, and errors,
that pervade the rule under which all our cam
pus organizations operate and which has more
power than most students realize over all of
!he things that we like and don't like about the
campus.
The Daily, with faith in the undergraduate
ever abounding, will try to keep everyone post
ed about the changes that are due to come up
lor discussion. Some of them are routine and
minor, and others will prove extremely inter
esting and perhaps debatable to those students,
who in the course of their days here, are not
so intellectually accomplished as to have most
questions of principle and practice already
beyond debate.
Saturday at 9 .m. Excom will meet to go over
the first draft of this Constitution. It would not
only be an excellent way to get in on the new,
but ail who come, will probably learn a lot
that Ihey didn't know about the old Constitu
tion.
People who are professing to be interested
in student government, now that elections are
not far away, might drop in to be forewarned.
