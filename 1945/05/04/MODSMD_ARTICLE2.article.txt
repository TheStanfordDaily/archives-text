# Wild Imperialist Capitalist Causes Wars, Says Bliven
## 
### 
Tlu; area of agreement, a! the San Francisco Conference is much larger
than the area oi disagreement," reported Mr. Bruce Bliven, editor of the
New Republic, at I lie Palo Alto Democratic Forum Wednesday evening.
Mr. Bliven was introduced to the campus by Miss Edith Mirrielees, pro
fessor of English, emeritus, at Stanford. Miss Mirrielees presented the

speaker as a former Stanford student
who was a leader of liberal thought
even during his campus days.
Mr. Blivcn began his talk on "The
San Franeiseo Conference and Its
Aftermath" by saying that the press
has ovcr-emphasi/.ed the differences,
explaining that the newspapers like
a fight and like to present every dif
ficulty as a "crisis," "deadlock," or
roadblock." The speaker stated that
lie believed that the Conference
would be a success. He added that
he hoped the United Nations organi
zation "will go far beyond merely
keeping peace."
Mr. Blivcn then discussed the pop
ularity of collective security in the
various countries taking part in the
Conference. He said that 80-85 per
cent of the American people favor
collective security, and that public
opinion must prevent the sabotage
of the United Nations agreements by
hampering amendments planned by
the United States Senate. The Brit
ish people, said Mr. Blivcn, tend to
rely on special alliances, but still, on
the whole, will go along with collec
tive security neasures.
"The Russians would be glad to
have collective security," stated the
speaker, recalling the efforts of I-.it
vinov before the League of Nations
in ir.35. He added that the Russians
are cynical of the desire of the West
ern capitalistic countries for collec
tive security, a point of view which
has some foundation. The small
countries will be strongly in favor
of collective security, and so will the
middle-sized nations if their private
affairs are not restricted, said Mr.
Bliven.
Some of the important events of
the Conference were then discussed
by the speaker, who is an accredited
press representative u( San Fran
cisco.
"I think that Stalin asked for three
votes because he was pushed from
within," said Mr. Bliven, adding that
the republics of the USSR "have a
larger degree of autonomy than most
people realize." He believed that
both White Russia and the Ukraine
put the pressure on Moscow for sep
arate representation.
On the Polish question, the speak
er said that he believes that Moscow
is sincerely trying to carry out the
Yalta agreement to reorganize the
Lublin government, but has been
blocked by the opposition of the
Lublinites. He added that Russia
was probably not very disturbed by
the refusal of the Conference to seat
the present Polish government.
Mr. Bliven criticized the political
bargain which he said was respon
sible for the acceptance of Argentina
by the Conference, stating that the
United Nations missed a good op
portunity to force Argentina to re
store civil liberties in accordance
with their endorsement of the Cha
pultepec agreements and the Atlan
tic Charter. The support of Argen
tina by the other Latin American
nations despite U.S. objections was
"the fruit of 50 years of not very
good treatment of the Latin Ameri
can countries at the hands of Yan
kee imperialism," he said. Latin
America does not want the United
States to act as a Western Hemi
sphere policeman, said Mr. Bliven,
and resented the pressure which we
put on Argentina the last lew years.
The World Court, explained the
speaker, would be essentially the
same as the old one, with only a
few .ninor changes.
In his discussion of the Economic
and Social Council, Mr. Bliven said

that there must be "either atrophy
1 of the Security Council within the
next fifteen years or destruction of
the whole organization." He ex
plained that if we ever have to use
I collective force against a big power,
it will spell the death of the organi
zation, since collective force can only
!be effective in preventing small
| wars. Stating that we "can't pos
| sibly do away with war until we
| have struggled with the causes of
| war," the speaker pointed out that
! the Economic and Social Council
! would have the job of eliminating
the causes of international conflict.
I Perhaps the most important cause of
| war is the activities of international
capitalism, said Mi'. Bliven, who
; added, "If we gel the wild intcr
i national capitalist under control,
peace will be sure; if not, war is in
evitable."
Mr. Bliven concluded hi.s talk with
this sober warning: "If we don't de
j velop a means of doing away with
! war, then war will do away with
j us. I don't know how we can stand
j another world war which will begin
! in horror where this one leaves off."

blocked by the opposition of the
Lublinites. He added that Russia
was probably not very disturbed by
the refusal of the Conference to seat
the present Polish government.
Mr. Bliven criticized the political
bargain which he said was respon
sible for the acceptance of Argentina
by the Conference, stating that the
United Nations missed a good op
portunity to force Argentina to re
store civil liberties in accordance
with their endorsement of the Cha
pultepec agreements and the Atlan
tic Charter. The support of Argen
tina by the other Latin American
nations despite U.S. objections was
"the fruit of 50 years of not very
good treatment of the Latin Ameri
can countries at the hands of Yan
kee imperialism," he said. Latin
America does not want the United
States to act as a Western Hemi
sphere policeman, said Mr. Bliven,
and resented the pressure which we
put on Argentina the last lew years.
The World Court, explained the
speaker, would be essentially the
same as the old one, with only a
few .ninor changes.
In his discussion of the Economic
and Social Council, Mr. Bliven said

that there must be "either atrophy
1 of the Security Council within the
next fifteen years or destruction of
the whole organization." He ex
plained that if we ever have to use
I collective force against a big power,
it will spell the death of the organi
zation, since collective force can only
!be effective in preventing small
| wars. Stating that we "can't pos
| sibly do away with war until we
| have struggled with the causes of
| war," the speaker pointed out that
! the Economic and Social Council
! would have the job of eliminating
the causes of international conflict.
I Perhaps the most important cause of
| war is the activities of international
capitalism, said Mi'. Bliven, who
; added, "If we gel the wild intcr
i national capitalist under control,
peace will be sure; if not, war is in
evitable."
Mr. Bliven concluded hi.s talk with
this sober warning: "If we don't de
j velop a means of doing away with
! war, then war will do away with
j us. I don't know how we can stand
j another world war which will begin
! in horror where this one leaves off."
Tlu; area of agreement, a! the San Francisco Conference is much larger
than the area oi disagreement," reported Mr. Bruce Bliven, editor of the
New Republic, at I lie Palo Alto Democratic Forum Wednesday evening.
Mr. Bliven was introduced to the campus by Miss Edith Mirrielees, pro
fessor of English, emeritus, at Stanford. Miss Mirrielees presented the

speaker as a former Stanford student
who was a leader of liberal thought
even during his campus days.
Mr. Blivcn began his talk on "The
San Franeiseo Conference and Its
Aftermath" by saying that the press
has ovcr-emphasi/.ed the differences,
explaining that the newspapers like
a fight and like to present every dif
ficulty as a "crisis," "deadlock," or
roadblock." The speaker stated that
lie believed that the Conference
would be a success. He added that
he hoped the United Nations organi
zation "will go far beyond merely
keeping peace."
Mr. Blivcn then discussed the pop
ularity of collective security in the
various countries taking part in the
Conference. He said that 80-85 per
cent of the American people favor
collective security, and that public
opinion must prevent the sabotage
of the United Nations agreements by
hampering amendments planned by
the United States Senate. The Brit
ish people, said Mr. Blivcn, tend to
rely on special alliances, but still, on
the whole, will go along with collec
tive security neasures.
"The Russians would be glad to
have collective security," stated the
speaker, recalling the efforts of I-.it
vinov before the League of Nations
in ir.35. He added that the Russians
are cynical of the desire of the West
ern capitalistic countries for collec
tive security, a point of view which
has some foundation. The small
countries will be strongly in favor
of collective security, and so will the
middle-sized nations if their private
affairs are not restricted, said Mr.
Bliven.
Some of the important events of
the Conference were then discussed
by the speaker, who is an accredited
press representative u( San Fran
cisco.
"I think that Stalin asked for three
votes because he was pushed from
within," said Mr. Bliven, adding that
the republics of the USSR "have a
larger degree of autonomy than most
people realize." He believed that
both White Russia and the Ukraine
put the pressure on Moscow for sep
arate representation.
On the Polish question, the speak
er said that he believes that Moscow
is sincerely trying to carry out the
Yalta agreement to reorganize the
Lublin government, but has been
blocked by the opposition of the
Lublinites. He added that Russia
was probably not very disturbed by
the refusal of the Conference to seat

put on Argentina the last lew years.
The World Court, explained the
speaker, would be essentially the

In his discussion of the Economic
and Social Council, Mr. Bliven said

that there must be "either atrophy
1 of the Security Council within the
next fifteen years or destruction of
the whole organization." He ex
plained that if we ever have to use
I collective force against a big power,
it will spell the death of the organi
zation, since collective force can only
!be effective in preventing small

! would have the job of eliminating
the causes of international conflict.
I Perhaps the most important cause of
| war is the activities of international
capitalism, said Mi'. Bliven, who
; added, "If we gel the wild intcr

peace will be sure; if not, war is in
evitable."
Mr. Bliven concluded hi.s talk with
this sober warning: "If we don't de

Bliven.
Some of the important events of
the Conference were then discussed
by the speaker, who is an accredited
press representative u( San Fran
cisco.
"I think that Stalin asked for three
votes because he was pushed from
within," said Mr. Bliven, adding that
the republics of the USSR "have a
larger degree of autonomy than most
people realize." He believed that
both White Russia and the Ukraine
put the pressure on Moscow for sep
arate representation.
On the Polish question, the speak
er said that he believes that Moscow
is sincerely trying to carry out the
Yalta agreement to reorganize the
Lublin government, but has been
blocked by the opposition of the
Lublinites. He added that Russia
was probably not very disturbed by
the refusal of the Conference to seat
the present Polish government.
Mr. Bliven criticized the political
bargain which he said was respon
sible for the acceptance of Argentina
by the Conference, stating that the
United Nations missed a good op
portunity to force Argentina to re
store civil liberties in accordance
with their endorsement of the Cha
pultepec agreements and the Atlan
tic Charter. The support of Argen
tina by the other Latin American
nations despite U.S. objections was
"the fruit of 50 years of not very
good treatment of the Latin Ameri
can countries at the hands of Yan
kee imperialism," he said. Latin
America does not want the United
States to act as a Western Hemi

Tlu; area of agreement, a! the San Francisco Conference is much larger
than the area oi disagreement," reported Mr. Bruce Bliven, editor of the
New Republic, at I lie Palo Alto Democratic Forum Wednesday evening.
Mr. Bliven was introduced to the campus by Miss Edith Mirrielees, pro
fessor of English, emeritus, at Stanford. Miss Mirrielees presented the

speaker as a former Stanford student
who was a leader of liberal thought
even during his campus days.
Mr. Blivcn began his talk on "The
San Franeiseo Conference and Its
Aftermath" by saying that the press
has ovcr-emphasi/.ed the differences,
explaining that the newspapers like
a fight and like to present every dif
ficulty as a "crisis," "deadlock," or
roadblock." The speaker stated that
lie believed that the Conference
would be a success. He added that
he hoped the United Nations organi
zation "will go far beyond merely
keeping peace."
Mr. Blivcn then discussed the pop
ularity of collective security in the
various countries taking part in the
Conference. He said that 80-85 per
cent of the American people favor
collective security, and that public
opinion must prevent the sabotage
of the United Nations agreements by
hampering amendments planned by
the United States Senate. The Brit
ish people, said Mr. Blivcn, tend to
rely on special alliances, but still, on
the whole, will go along with collec
tive security neasures.
"The Russians would be glad to
have collective security," stated the
speaker, recalling the efforts of I-.it
vinov before the League of Nations
in ir.35. He added that the Russians
are cynical of the desire of the West
ern capitalistic countries for collec
tive security, a point of view which
has some foundation. The small
countries will be strongly in favor
of collective security, and so will the
middle-sized nations if their private
affairs are not restricted, said Mr.
Bliven.
