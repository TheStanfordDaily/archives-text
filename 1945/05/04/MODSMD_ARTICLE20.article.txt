The war in Europe is practically over, and
everybody is asking everybody else when
I hey think the Far Eastern battle will be over.
It is not the purpose of this column to attempt
to answer that question, but simply say that we
should leave the predictions to competenl gen
erals who enjoy the realm of prophecy.
Just look into the records of prophecy by
generals during the last war.
In 1914, Molkte 11, commander of the Ger
man forces, said, "We should win the decisive
victory by the 21st day of mobilization." On
that day, the German army was in retreat all
along the line.
On September 13th, 1914, General Wilson
wrote of a discussion with the French staff
officer, Berthelot. "Berthelot asked me when I
thought we should cross into Germany, and I
replied in four weeks. He thought three
weeks."
On that day the Allied armies had reached

the line of the Aisne, where they remained for
the next four years.
In January, 1915, General French, C-in-C of
the BEF, predicted that the war would be over
before June; in February, Joffre said it would
be over in July, and in March, Haig said that
the Germans could be beaten by July, but
might hold on until November, and that, in
any case, they would be defeated by January,
1916.
The big Allied offensive came on July Ist,
1916, when Haig, according to the British of
ficial records, "impressed all that the infantry
could walk over and lake the trenches." The
whole affair, of course, was a complete failure.
The casually rates for that day alone were
60,000.
In J917, Nivelle replaced Joffre as comman
der in-chief. He instantly plotted an offensive,
predicting that he would gain six miles on the
first day, and more from then on until "the
great pursuit lo the Rhine was underway."
On Ihe first day, the offensive gained 300
yards, and from then on nothing was made but
a casualty list of 120,000.
In June, 1917, Haig, in the middle of an
offensive, declared that Germany would
lapse at any time. Even the transfer of troops
would not check him, he said. In January,
1918, he said that the Germans were so severely
weakened that they could not possibly attack
him. On March 21st, they launched a counter
offensive that broke through his front to a depth
of 40 miles.
It can thus be seen that we might as well
leave predictions about durations of wars to
generals. They enjoy it, and with them it is
just as much a shot in the dark as with us. The
duration of a war has pretty nearly always been
an imponderable. (This article was based on
parts of "Europe in Arms," by Captain B. H.
Liddell Hart, British Army.)

1918, he said that the Germans were so severely
weakened that they could not possibly attack
him. On March 21st, they launched a counter
offensive that broke through his front to a depth
of 40 miles.
It can thus be seen that we might as well
leave predictions about durations of wars to
generals. They enjoy it, and with them it is
just as much a shot in the dark as with us. The
duration of a war has pretty nearly always been
an imponderable. (This article was based on
parts of "Europe in Arms," by Captain B. H.
Liddell Hart, British Army.)
The war in Europe is practically over, and
everybody is asking everybody else when
I hey think the Far Eastern battle will be over.
It is not the purpose of this column to attempt
to answer that question, but simply say that we
should leave the predictions to competenl gen
erals who enjoy the realm of prophecy.
Just look into the records of prophecy by
generals during the last war.
In 1914, Molkte 11, commander of the Ger
man forces, said, "We should win the decisive
victory by the 21st day of mobilization." On
that day, the German army was in retreat all
along the line.
On September 13th, 1914, General Wilson
wrote of a discussion with the French staff
officer, Berthelot. "Berthelot asked me when I
thought we should cross into Germany, and I
replied in four weeks. He thought three
weeks."
On that day the Allied armies had reached

the line of the Aisne, where they remained for
the next four years.
In January, 1915, General French, C-in-C of
the BEF, predicted that the war would be over
before June; in February, Joffre said it would
be over in July, and in March, Haig said that
the Germans could be beaten by July, but
might hold on until November, and that, in
any case, they would be defeated by January,
1916.
The big Allied offensive came on July Ist,
1916, when Haig, according to the British of
ficial records, "impressed all that the infantry
could walk over and lake the trenches." The
whole affair, of course, was a complete failure.
The casually rates for that day alone were
60,000.
In J917, Nivelle replaced Joffre as comman
der in-chief. He instantly plotted an offensive,
predicting that he would gain six miles on the
first day, and more from then on until "the
great pursuit lo the Rhine was underway."
On Ihe first day, the offensive gained 300
yards, and from then on nothing was made but
a casualty list of 120,000.
In June, 1917, Haig, in the middle of an
offensive, declared that Germany would
lapse at any time. Even the transfer of troops
would not check him, he said. In January,
1918, he said that the Germans were so severely
weakened that they could not possibly attack
him. On March 21st, they launched a counter
offensive that broke through his front to a depth
of 40 miles.
