Editor:
This letter is prompted by an incident which took
place last Monday evening, and which will have a
profound effect on the overall result of the Convales
cent Home Drive. "The overall result" does not only
imply the monetary returns to aid the Con Home next
year, but includes also the spirit with which each per
son works this week for the Con Home, and the lasting
impression made on those students who in future years
will carry on these tasks.
The incident mentioned concerns the pre-soliciting
dinner which is traditionally given for couples who
are collecting off-campus this week. A large percent
age of these people are the creators and directors of
our campus life, and who persuade their friends into
new lines of thought and action.
This lack of interest meant that there was an enor
mous amount of food left over, and that (he envelopes
for twenty soliciting districts were not picked up.
Twenty districts represent about 50 per cent of the total
number of ofT-campus areas, and a large part of ihe
total moneys collected for the Con Home children come
from just such places. Is that exhibition truly repre
sentative of the Stanford Student Body?
And what have our pleasant, personality-plus lead
ers been doing all this time? Many people have com
plained that the old off-campus spirit is gone because
of the lack of sports, and that it will return when inter
collegiate activities return. But will it? Must we have
inter-collegiate contests in order to arouse each indi
vidual in our community? #
Is a team on the Held THE ONLY FORCE which
holds student groups together? No, it could not he
(he sole cause of "spirit." Con Home Drives, Water
Carnivals, Barbecues, ami Tresidder hikes would
have disappeared long ago if that were the case.
The hlame cannot rightfully he placed on (he war
and its stepped-up programs. The war has caused
a tremendous turnover in the Student Body, and it
has manufactured numerous unexpected situations.

ICISM IS DIRECTED ARE THOSE WHO WERE
HERE A YEAR AGO, AND WIIO MAY BE HERE A
YEAR HENCE IE THEY SO DESIRE!!!
Nor can the errors be accredited to an increased
amount of study, or "tomorrow's midterms." The per
* son who does the best work, the most efficient work,
is the one who can always squeeze in just one more job.
He i.s the competent person, and he is the one to look
for in war or peace.
The major fault, then lies in only one place. The
failure of many of our "leaders" to take seriously their
responsibilites is reflected in incidences of which the
above is an example.
It is too late (o change (hat which has passed, hu(

This letter is prompted by an incident which took
place last Monday evening, and which will have a
profound effect on the overall result of the Convales
cent Home Drive. "The overall result" does not only
imply the monetary returns to aid the Con Home next
year, but includes also the spirit with which each per
son works this week for the Con Home, and the lasting
impression made on those students who in future years
will carry on these tasks.
The incident mentioned concerns the pre-soliciting
dinner which is traditionally given for couples who
are collecting off-campus this week. A large percent
age of these people are the creators and directors of
our campus life, and who persuade their friends into
new lines of thought and action.
This lack of interest meant that there was an enor
mous amount of food left over, and that (he envelopes
for twenty soliciting districts were not picked up.
Twenty districts represent about 50 per cent of the total
number of ofT-campus areas, and a large part of ihe
total moneys collected for the Con Home children come
from just such places. Is that exhibition truly repre
sentative of the Stanford Student Body?
And what have our pleasant, personality-plus lead
ers been doing all this time? Many people have com
plained that the old off-campus spirit is gone because
of the lack of sports, and that it will return when inter
collegiate activities return. But will it? Must we have
inter-collegiate contests in order to arouse each indi
vidual in our community? #
Is a team on the Held THE ONLY FORCE which
holds student groups together? No, it could not he
(he sole cause of "spirit." Con Home Drives, Water
Carnivals, Barbecues, ami Tresidder hikes would
have disappeared long ago if that were the case.
The hlame cannot rightfully he placed on (he war
and its stepped-up programs. The war has caused
a tremendous turnover in the Student Body, and it
has manufactured numerous unexpected situations.
BUT THE PERSONS TOWARD WHOM THIS C RIT
ICISM IS DIRECTED ARE THOSE WHO WERE
HERE A YEAR AGO, AND WIIO MAY BE HERE A
YEAR HENCE IE THEY SO DESIRE!!!
Nor can the errors be accredited to an increased
amount of study, or "tomorrow's midterms." The per
* son who does the best work, the most efficient work,
is the one who can always squeeze in just one more job.
He i.s the competent person, and he is the one to look
