An AST student from the University of Connecticut
sent us this poem.
A BITTER PILL
Just think nf some poor captain,
Minus all his silver bars,
Standing behind a counter
Selling peanuts and cigars.
And think of all the majors,
With their oak leaves far behind,
And the uniforms they're wearing
Are the Western Union kind.
Shed a tear for some poor colonel
II he doesn't feel himself,
Jerking sodas isn't easy
When your eagle's on the shelf.
'Tis a bitter pill to swallow,
'Tis a matter of despairâ€”
Being messengers and clerks again
Is a mighty cross to bear.
So be kind to working people
That you meet, where e'er you go.
For the guy that's washing dishes
May he your old C.O.
This accident was taken care of just as all others,
the universal fudge factor was applied to all readings
The gang turned in the usual report, "Mission accom
plished."
