# Women to 'Beachcomb' For Dates-Senior Dance
## 
### 
The seniors invite all campus women to find a man and join them for
an evening of South Sea Island beachcombing Friday, May 11, from 9 to 12.
The dance is a "girl-ask-boy" affair, and beachcomber clothes are to be
worn.
The setting for the senior "Castaway Sway" will be the cast-off spot of

"♦■the outside tennis courts behind the
I Pavilion, where you may sway to
orchestra music in the balmy tropi
cal night.
Only lighting will be candle-light
from the little tables around the
edge of the flor and from the South
Sea Island Bar where thirsty dancers
may imbibe a special "South Sea
Island punch."
Committee heads are: Barbara
Burroughs, general chairman; Pat
Pierce, decorations; Dick Fayram,
I orchestra; Verna Pace, refreshments.
Dance bids at $1.10 are now on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office in the
Union.
