# Walford Talks On Fisheries
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
Dr. Lionel A. Walford, in a talk
before the biology seminar Wednes
day afternoon, said that there are
at present 40 vacancies in fishery
biology on the Columbia River, with
no prospects in sight.
The need for increased production
of food fish, said Dr. Walford, is
reflected by the fact that 50 Chinese
biologists are coming to this coun
try for fisheries training, some of
whom may come to Stanford, which
is one of four institutions in the
United States able to provide such
training.
Emphasis Changes
The speaker pointed out that the
emphasis in fisheries work has
changed from hatcheries and the
study of fish in the days of Stan
ford's David Starr Jordan and
Charles H. Bilbert to the quantitave
problem of fish conservation.
Future fisheries work, stated Dr.
Walford, will have to meet the prob
lems caused by the building of higher
dams and depletion of protein food
supply.
Describes Profession
Dr. Walford, after describing the
fisheries biology profession as in part
applied science and in part creative
science, went on to say that most of
the preparatory course work could
be completed during undergraduate
years, although a year of graduate
study is necessary to the man or wo
man who hopes to go far in fishery
biology.
Courses recommended by Dr. Wal
ford are as follows: Vertebrate zo
ology (anatomy and classification),
ecology (biology of populations, pop
ulations dynamics, experimental
ecology), general physiology of the
whole organism, mathematics
through calculus, statistics, oceano
graphy, and limnolgy.
He added that although mathemat
ics is becoming increasingly import
ant in fisheries work, the fundamen
tal training and viewpoint must al
ways be that of the biologist.
