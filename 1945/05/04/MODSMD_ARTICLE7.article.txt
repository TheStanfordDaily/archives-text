v LONDON, May 3 (UP). â€”Negotiations for Gorman surrender 4
may now be in progress, diplomatic quarters believed tonight,
as German Munitions Minister Albert Speer hinted in a radio
specch that the end of the war hinged solely on Allied generosity
'o a "vanquished opponent."
Speaking in the name of the German government over the
Danish radio, Speer said: "The only meaning of the struggle still
being waged at this moment is in our desire not to allow our
German compatriots fleeing from the east to die. For the rest,
the degree to which our opponents will concede to the German
people honor and the possibilities of a vanquished but honorable
and herocially fighting opponent is entirely in their hands."
