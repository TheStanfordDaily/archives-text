SMALIf, NATIONS
There had been much said about the role of small
nations in the coming conference. There are as
many different unofficial opinions on what they will
ask as there are commentators.
The deputy head of the delegation of Norway,
Dr. C. J. Hambro, made some enlightening remarks
upon this subject before the Electric Club of San
Francisco last week. What he said seems not only

reasonable, but perhaps quite representative of
the smaller power's attitudes.
Dr. Hambro has had quite a bit of background in
international affairs, and in the last League. He was
the last president of the Assembly in the latter. He
is also president of the Norwegian Parliament.
VOTING ISSUE
Using his league experience to point out the dif
ferences between that organization and the one pro
posed at Dumbarton Oaks, Dr. Hambro plunged into
what they added up to at this conference, the voting
issue.
"In case of aggression," he said, "the old League
could only recommend the application of sanctions
to each nation, and each nation would have to make
up its own mind about applying them."
This caused* so much red tape, he claimed, that an
aggressor nation could fortify its position before the
sanctions were put into effect.
Now, however, the Security Council will be able
to act directly, over the heads of the various nations,
as soon as an aggressor is proven as such. Thus,
representation and voting power on the Council be
comes of extreme importance.
In regards to sanctions, he pointed out that the
economic sanction is extremely effective. When it
is applied, all international patent and trademark
lights of the aggressor might be declared invalid.
Mail, telegraph messages, and exports to and from
an aggressor would be stopped. This will highly disrupt
his economy.
SMALL NATION SUPPORT
He asserted that small nations would be behind
international organization of large scope, considering
the international committees and services of limited
objective which arose from them. The Nobel Prize
and the Red Cross are examples.
He remarked that international co-operation is the
main basis of lasting peace, not force. He showed that
the co-ordination of several nationalities by one gov
ernmental body, as in Switzerland, and as in Austria
Hungary, gives great hope.
"In light of this fact," he said, "we all must not
ask ourselves, "How far can we trust the other fel
low?" but, "How far can he trust us?"
His speech was clever, witty and delivex*ed in a
style of Oxfordian English that would be the envy
of any American speaker. He raised searching ques
tions, and answered them well. It will be interesting to
compare his solutions with those of other small nation
delegates.
