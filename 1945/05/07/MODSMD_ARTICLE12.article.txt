### PEGGY FITTS 
That was a wonderful column that didn't get into
Friday's paper; you'll never'know how wonderful it
was (nad that's a good thing, too). Sitting behind a
copy desk seems to bring out the best in people. Prose
that burns with a hard, gem-like flame doesn't cut any
cake with an H.C.E. if it won't smoulder down into the
right number of inches. Nothing like an exclusive
circulation to build up your P.T.W. rating (pushed to
the wall, as we say in the profession). That one circu
lated from right about here to right about there, where
we plan to erect a memorial waste-basket as soon as
a surplus real's its pretty head. (You small attractive
surplus!)
The latest good word about the Spring Show, Palo
Alto's answer to "Oklahoma!" (where the little green
bus comes sweeping down Palm Drive), is that it will
be visible and everything this week from Thursday
on. Buy your tickets early, and this time we mean it.
Smiling girls in bunny coats will be selling them on
English corner this morning commencing at 8 o'clock,
and that ought to be early enough. No tickets are
going to Paly until everybody on campus has had a
chance at them, but we might just as well tell you
that there aren't enough to go around unless you can
bring your own trapeze.
They only cost a dollar, including the amusement
tax, so you can plainly see that there are people in
high places who think it's amusing. (Come out of that
tree, Corky.) All the extra dollars are going to the
Con Home, closely followed by the members of the
cast. Doesn't that tug at your purse-strings? Open up
for the time of your life.
