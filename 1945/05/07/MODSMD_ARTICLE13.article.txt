To The Editor:
It is impossible for each of us to thank personally
the 40 or more couples who generously offered their
midterm time to solicit contributions for the Con Home
in what turned oul to be the biggest off-campus drive
ever. So, collectors, consider this our formal bread
and butter note—after all that's what your work for
the kiddies amounted to, bread and butter and nurs
ing back to health
Congratulations; we are bursting with pride and
satisfaction at the record-shattering outcome, never
before equalled any year. Thanks, too, to Millie
Edwards and her diligent committee ofr the banquet
arrangements; to Loui.-o for her cooking; to Paul Davis
for his "pep talk:" to Frank Fish Walker for the
trucks; and to the prize donors, Mr. Eickie and Willie
and Eddie.
The eager, happy children out at the Home depended
on student support and got it—53,182.81 worth!
