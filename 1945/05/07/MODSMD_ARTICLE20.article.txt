# Who's Got the Bell? Hurlburt Asks Campus
## 
### 
In the middle of Soph Carnival
festivities Friday night, a large,
cast-iron dinner hell disappeared
from somewhere on the Pavilion
floor. The bell, which was used by
liurlhurt House to advertise its
candied-apple cart, was loaned to
the Ruble taxi-dancer concession
and evidently disappeared from
there.
Weighing about 50 pounds, the
bell has a long, rod-like, iron han
dle with which to pick it up. Any
one who has seen the bell, or
knows of its whereabouts, is asked
to call Hurlburt House at P.A.
8660.
The bell belongs to Alpha Delta
Phi fraternity and was just loaned
to Hurlburt for the duration. Hurl
burt is especially anxious, for this
reason, to get the bell back.
