# Monroe Paces Softballers

### BOB GILKEY 
Monroe's Belting Boozers, with an
unblemished record of seven wins j
and no losses, continue to dominate
the soltball circuit at the league
swings into the final round of play
tomorrow afternoon.
The pitching of Joe Sher coupled
with the slugging of Ed Luce and
Bob Rosburg has proved an unbeat- ;
able combination to date, and Mon- !
roe looks like a virtual shoo-in
against the last-place Flacs tomor
row. However, the Flacs showed
plenty of power last week, in win- |
ning their first victory of the sea- ;
son, an 18-12 triumph over Bu
chanan, and might prove trouble
some. If George Malloy proves the
answer to the pitching problem and
the hitting and fielding continues to !
improve, the Flacs should better j
their first-round record by plenty.
The most interesting contest of I
the day should be the battle between j
third-place Phi Psi and vastly-im
proved Arguello. Phi Psi trounced i
the Arguellans soundly in the first
round, but Tony Ortega's team has |
been constantly improving and j
should wage a close contest, espe- j
cially if the Phi Psi's are still with
out the services of Luke Pitts, their
star pitcher. If Pitts is unable to
hurl. Bob Stephens will again han
dle the mound duties, backed by the
slugging power of Tom Ashley, Tom ]
Hood, and Bob Nesbit.
In other games, the Med School's
formidable second-place club, paced
by Doc Mason, former Stanford var
sity star, is heavily favored over
the Buchanan Bearcats, while Ty
ler's Hilltoppers, sparked by the hit
ting strength of Dennis Fox and Joe
Pickering, have an excellent chance
of turning the tables on the slipping
Legal Eagles, who won a close vic
tory in the first round.
