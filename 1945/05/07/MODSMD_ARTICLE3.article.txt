LONDON. Monday, May 7 (UP). ;
—The Stockholm newspaper Dagen |
Nvhadter said today that Hans
Thomsen, German minister to Swe
den. was en route to the north front
with surrender documents which
would be delivered this morning to
Allied legations in the Swedish cap
ital.
The dispatch was entirely without
Allied confirmation but King George
and Queen Elizabeth returned to
Buckingham Palace last night and !
it was presumed the king was J
standing by for important develop
ments.
The Stockholm dispatch did not J
say whether the documents provided j
for the surrender of Norway or the
complete capitulation of Germany. I
However, it pointed out that due j
to faster delivery of ihe document :
to the legations, the capitulation ;
would be announced in Allied capi
tals.
Adding to the indications that im
portant developments were in the j
offing, First Lord of the Admiralty j
A. V. Alexander canceled an en- !
gagement to speak last night at i
Sheffield, 140 miles from London.
A few hours before the King's re
turn, usually reliable British sources j
indicated that announcement of the 1
end of the war in Europe with the
unconditional surrender of Ger- I
many might be expected very soon, j
Indications that the end was here j
seemed based on the belief that i
Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, who
succeeded Adolph Hitler as German :
leader, was preparing to give up.
Apparently informants took it for
granted that Doenitz if he desired
could surrender all remaining troops |
including those in Norway and Cze- !
choslovakia. In testimony to the
break-up of Germany, Portugal
broke relations with the Reich on
the ground that no central German
power remained with which Por
tugal could maintain relations, the
Portuguese overseas service an
nounced.
