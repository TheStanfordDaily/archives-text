### BETH MacVICAR 
"The spirit of cooperation at this Conference far
surpasses that of the League of Nations conference."
These were the words of Jesus Maria Yapes, for twelve
years Colombian consul general in Geneva, and for
merly a representative at the League of Nations con
ference. .»-

"Before, it was England against j
France, France against Italy . . . this !
time, everyone has a chance, every
one is willing to help everyone else.
We are all encouraged . . Mr.
Yepes, grey - haired, smiling, was
standing in the rose garden of Pro- !
fessor and Mrs. James Mcßain, com
menting to students and faculty
guests who were invited to attend
the tea given yesterday afternoon j
in honor of UNCIO delegates visit
ing Stanford.
I So typically Californian was the
scene—a conglomerate of sunshine
and flowers and neat, placid archi- |
tecture — that the busy sound of ;
voices speaking Spanish, Portuguese,
and French seemed a trifle bizarre. |
The red fez of Mr. K. A. Kahan
bobbed up and down among the j
roses, and he spoke of cities, and j
I universities, and rose gardens like j
I these in his native India.
Mr. Kahan, a Moslem, strolled side '
I by side with the Hindu delegate,
Mr. K. P. Thampi, who was en
i grossed in a discussion of chemistry
! with Professor Mcßain. When Mr.
! Kahan challenged the assertions of j
t Mrs. Pandit last week concerning
J India, he caused such a commotion i
j among press circles that he has since j
I shaved his beard to evade photogra- j
j pliers.
Four advisers to the Iraquian del
egation arrived in mid-afternoon, all !
of the same height, wearing similar j
smiles and conservative striped suits.
From the city of legends-. Baghdad,
came Majid Kheduri and Abdul
Majid Abbas.
Mr. Abbas said that there were no
j universities in Iraq, but colleges of '
| specialized training under govern-!
| ment supervision. Plans to incorpo
| rate the colleges into a University
j of Baghdad were already under way,
j he said.
"We allow the students to form
J societies within the schools, but stu
j dent government is practically un- !
j known," said Mr. Kheduri .
"Women, they are just beginning J
! to attend colleges."
Mr. Abbas told of the beginnings '
I of a fine arts school in Baghdad, in I
which Western music is being in
| troduced for the first time.
One nervous guest ventured the
stereotyped "What do you think of
I Stanford?" and from a smiling dele-
J gate came the reply, '"Ho, don't ask
me that—l went to Cal."
Inside the house, three Iranian
students, Amin Banani of Stanford,
Esatollah Amin of Tehran, and Par
viz Khamsi waited for their dele
gation to arrive, answering in per
fect English the inquiries of curious
guests. The latter two had arrived
a week before from Iran, planning
to study international law and med
icine at Columbia University. Amin
I said his visit to Los Angeles had |
| almost persuaded him to study at j
| U.C.L.A., despite Banani's insistent j
; praise of Stanford.
| He scoffed at our remarks about
I the fog in San Francisco. "It is i
! beautiful here," he smiled. "San i
i Francisco—it is truly the capital of I
the world."

fessor and Mrs. James Mcßain, com

guests who were invited to attend
the tea given yesterday afternoon j
in honor of UNCIO delegates visit
ing Stanford.
I So typically Californian was the
scene—a conglomerate of sunshine
and flowers and neat, placid archi- |
tecture — that the busy sound of ;
voices speaking Spanish, Portuguese,
and French seemed a trifle bizarre. |
The red fez of Mr. K. A. Kahan
bobbed up and down among the j
roses, and he spoke of cities, and j
I universities, and rose gardens like j
I these in his native India.
Mr. Kahan, a Moslem, strolled side '
I by side with the Hindu delegate,
Mr. K. P. Thampi, who was en
i grossed in a discussion of chemistry
! with Professor Mcßain. When Mr.
! Kahan challenged the assertions of j
t Mrs. Pandit last week concerning
J India, he caused such a commotion i
j among press circles that he has since j
I shaved his beard to evade photogra- j
j pliers.
Four advisers to the Iraquian del
egation arrived in mid-afternoon, all !
of the same height, wearing similar j
smiles and conservative striped suits.
From the city of legends-. Baghdad,
came Majid Kheduri and Abdul
Majid Abbas.
Mr. Abbas said that there were no
j universities in Iraq, but colleges of '
| specialized training under govern-!
| ment supervision. Plans to incorpo
| rate the colleges into a University
j of Baghdad were already under way,
j he said.
"We allow the students to form
J societies within the schools, but stu
j dent government is practically un- !
j known," said Mr. Kheduri .
"Women, they are just beginning J
! to attend colleges."
Mr. Abbas told of the beginnings '
I of a fine arts school in Baghdad, in I
which Western music is being in
| troduced for the first time.
One nervous guest ventured the
stereotyped "What do you think of
I Stanford?" and from a smiling dele-
J gate came the reply, '"Ho, don't ask
me that—l went to Cal."
Inside the house, three Iranian
students, Amin Banani of Stanford,
Esatollah Amin of Tehran, and Par
viz Khamsi waited for their dele
gation to arrive, answering in per
fect English the inquiries of curious
guests. The latter two had arrived
a week before from Iran, planning
to study international law and med
icine at Columbia University. Amin
I said his visit to Los Angeles had |
| almost persuaded him to study at j
| U.C.L.A., despite Banani's insistent j
; praise of Stanford.
| He scoffed at our remarks about
I the fog in San Francisco. "It is i
! beautiful here," he smiled. "San i
i Francisco—it is truly the capital of I
the world."

surpasses that of the League of Nations conference."
