the seniors. It's the time of year when they
stop and say "and next year when the lake
fills, I won't be here." . . . "This soph carnival
is the last soph carnival." ... "I never wanted
to see my senior ball come."
We all know the way things are, and even
seniors can't be what they used to be, compet
ing with V-E Day, the UNCIO, and counter
attacks on Okinawaâ€”the old-timers are defi
nitely pushed down in the proportion of things.
We suppose it's the time when one recalls
one's blessings one by one, begins to let the
errors and follies slip into the background and
"college days" take on that notorious "alumni
haze" that clouds our judgment for time to come.
Perhaps, because they have seen the Farm in
the "growing pains" of evolving and existing
through the war, this will not be permissible
for these seniors.
All around us is the beginning of new eras
and the return of old problems. The future of
the private institution is one on a large scale.
The promotion of vocational departments and
* special divisions may influence colleges
greatly.
Always there will be coming changes among
activities, the homes, the people that are left
at Stanford, and probably they will often be
resented.
This graduating class has probably been
really closer to the University, seeing it without
much of the ballyhoo and fanfare of old; there
has been no time for that, and consequently,
perhaps, now and in the future it can play an
exceptionally great role for its welfare and
its repute throughout the world.
