# Not Over Yet; Back 7th Loan
## Save Celebrating 'til Men in Foxholes Can Help Us; Buy Bonds Until Then 
### DICK CRANE 
With momentous words literally bouncing off the walls of the
Daily Shack every minute, and in a general excitement of phrases
as "unconditional surrender," "total capitulation," and finally"the
war in Europe is over," it seems an appropriate time to bring in
some national news to calm you down.
Although the war in Europe is definitely in its final phases,
the war in which the United States is fighting, which by the way,
concerns every one of us, isn't over by a long way. As a matter
of fact we are still in the middle of a long, hard struggle that will
require the utmost effort on the part of everyone if we are going
to emerge really victorious in this total war.
Don't Forget Japan
Have you forgotten the war with Japan? I'm sure there are
some Americans who think the war with the Japanese far more
important than the war with Germany. If you have any doubts as
to that statement, ask some Marine who is sitting in a foxhole on
Okinawa right this minute. He might confirm my suspicions.
The war to that Marine is not a global war, it is probably a war
pthat takes place in an area of about ten yardsâ€”that little space
means life or death to him.
Strategy for Living
The war to him is not grand strategy of great nations striving |
to out-maneuver each other in military might or power politics; 1
it is strategy of trying to outwit some enemy, so that he may live. I
The horrors of the concentration camp, although terrible and
requiring the punishment of the people responsible for the atroci
ties, are not nearly as important to that Marine as seeing his
buddy shot right in front of him, or losing a leg or arm himself.
Save Celebration
All of these things are happening in the world right at this
minute, and in the general air of excitement over the fact that the
news of the German surrender might come any minute, we
should keep our celebrations until a day when a few million guys
in the South Pacific can help us do it.
There are a lot of events happening that will tend to make
us complacent about the war, and this we must not do. That Ma
rine on Okinawa can't afford to be complacent, or he will be dead,
so in due respect to that guy and a million others like him, fight
ing in the South Pacific, we all should subscribe to our utmost in
the Seventh War Loan which begins here at Stanford on Friday,
May 11, 1945.
