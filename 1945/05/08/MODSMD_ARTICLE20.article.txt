The war in Europe is ovr. As this column predicted, the German
pockets formed after the collapse of the Rhine line gave up with not too
much fighting. The problem of moving troops to the Pacific has begun.
Europe is shattered industrially. It is morally shaken, since most of it
has been conquered, either by Germany or by us. Still, in the haggling of

♦ San Francisco, we see the seeds of
new wars, which may be, and we
hope will be, stamped out.
But we also see the seeds of revo
lution. This is not necessarily Com
munist revolution, but Fascist revo
lution. Fascist revolution is born in
the firing line, and goes as far as
economic stagnation and chaos. Both
the firing line and the chaos arc
much larger in scope this time.
The question in Europe now is
not "power polities or collective
security?" or '"militarism or paci
fism?" It is not even, "What will
we do with Germany?" It really
is, "Did this war destroy civiliza
tion?"
The war is over, but, paradoxi
cally enough, we don't know the
answer to the question. Since Com
munism is by nature radical, and
Fascism is by nature conservative,
| the latter has a better chance in a
revolutionary situation, since people
are by nature conservative. The
spread of Communism would mean
the alteration of civilization, the re
naissance of Fascism, its destruc
tion.
Fascism cannot be beaten by
force, since it is an idea and not a
target for bayonets. Ii is admit
tedly bad, and admittedly un
sound, but it is still an idea.
It can only be beaten by h moral
and economic renaissance in once
conquered Europe. If this war did
end civilization, it will have done so
by destroying civilization's recu
perative powers.
