# THE 						ANTI CLIMAX
## 
### 
V-E Day does not mark the end of hostili
ties for the American People; the long-antici
pated celebrations will not be followed by
peace for our nation. The bloody war in the
Pacific will continue from shoal to shoal and
perhaps on the Japanese homeland until a
stubborn and tenacious race is conquered to
every last suicide pilot and sniper.
And yet we celebrate justly and offer pray
er: from an entire nation that more than futile
suffering and irremediable woe will come from
this upheaval in ten million lives.
We will do well to pray that no one will seek
revenge for these deeds upon lives that are
not yet begun in a beaten Europe.
We hope that the feelings of, citizens will not
abide the acts of statesmen who will allow tem
porary high emotions to guide the fate of gen
erations in the great task of rebuilding, now
before the world.
More directly within our power is prayer for
rniilions of individual lives that must continue
despite mental and physical hurt by the pro
longed and intimate brutality, where all long
itin values have seemed simply figments of
imagination from indifferent minds.
There is cause to celebrate, however, the
final wiping away of great clouds of prejudice,
menace, and misunderstanding that have hung
over Europe throughout our lifetime.
We enter a new period in which men can
remedy errors and build a new circumstance
of peace in-so far as their reason and knowledge
can allow thern to escape from rooted errors and
shoi Isightedness.
V-E Day is here, and peace is becoming a
real thing again.
