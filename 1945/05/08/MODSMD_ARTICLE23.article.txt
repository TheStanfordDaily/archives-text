War has been this! The soldier and the
ragged priest stumble through the glaring
town. Old men, weeping women, and merry
children scamper wildly up the streets, while
the church bells toll and the sun hovers like
an ember in the swirling smoke.
The little soldier crawls into the shattered
church, ana glares at the dust and tumbled
beauty. The priest hobbles after him holding
high a vsithered cross for the children hiding
in the ruins to see.
The little soldier crouches and fires at the
roof. The men on the roof tumble silently like
weighted sacks into the streets. On the walls
sway withered bodies, mocking the withered
town and the withered people.
"Our lives growing smaller, smaller, and
smaller," wail the bereaved, while the little
soldier kills the men on the roof. Then he
spies the children and smiles. He is shot;
and slumps like a brown rag in the dust.
The children come over to play with his body
and the priest holds the cross over them.
One of the children fires a pistol at him, and

he falls by the little soldier. The children take
the cross and run into the street.
The war for all practical purposes has
ended and the period of German military oc
cupation begins. The problems of occupation
will be vast and complicated, including re
education of the German people in the ways
of civilized nations.
Efforts must be made to stem the sinister
activities of underground resistance groups
such as the Werewolves who will attempt to
make the occupation as unpleasant as possible
for us. Lawlessness must be discouraged by
v/hatever means possible. Most important, the
population should be instructed by example
and discipline that we intend to deal justly
here as in all human affairs.
