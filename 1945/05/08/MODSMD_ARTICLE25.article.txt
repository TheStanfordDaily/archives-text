# Seen from an Ivory Tower

Alice looked up, and saw an ugly head poking in
through the railway carriage window.
The Guard stared rudely about the carriage; he
frowned at the Goat with the white beard (who was
snoring most mellifluously), ho fivowned at the Old
Gentleman (who was all dressed in white paper), and
he frowned at Alice.
"You!" he said in a dry nasal voice, glaring at Alice,
"where's your ticket?"
"Where are your manners!" said Alice, who was too
offended by his behaviour to be afraid of him.
"Paugh, stuff and nonsense!" said the Guard, trying
not to be flustered. And, taking out a large telescope,
he looked at Alice —first through one end of the tele
scope and then through the other.
"You're going the wrong way!" he announced sud
denly, and before Alice could reply he had slammed
the window shut and disappeared.
"But how could he know whether or not I'm going
the right way," said Alice, who was quite puzzled,
"unless he knows where I want to go in the first place?"
"Because he practices Semantics," said the Goat,
waking up with a start.
"I thought people like that were put in jail!" said
Alice, shocked to hear a nice looking Goat mention
such revolting depravities in public.
"Not professors," said the Old Gentleman, "because
they're peculiarly harmless, or harmlessly peculiar; 1
can't quite remember which."
"But the Guard wasn't a professor," said Alice.
"Perhaps not," said the Goat, "but we ore, and we
have no wish to go to jail."
"Oh, how interesting!" cried Alice, "a real live pro
fessor! Do tell me all about what you do."
"It's very complicated," admitted the Goat, furrow
ing his brow as though it really were complicated; "you
see, Science is the center of Civilization, and we're the
center of Science."
"Oh!" cried Alice, who was very impressed, "but how
do you learn about Science?"
"Whenever a Scientific problem arises," replied the
Old Gentleman, "we un-freeze a Scientist (Scientists
are sort of round, pink things with spectacles and con
stipation) and transfer it from the ice-box to a small
cubicle or stuffy cubbyhole. Then we add a little corn
meal mush (enriched with vitamins), an adding ma
chine, a slide rule, and a few other well oiled gadgets
and devices. Soon the problem is solved."
"But," said Alice, "how do you tell when the prob
lem is solved?"
"That's very simple," said the Goat, fingering his
beard as though he were infinitely wise, "when a Sci
entist is working it is bluish and slightly frigid; you
can tell when it's finished working because it burbles
noisily and gives off quantities of gas and nauseous
vapor."
"It all sounds very fascinating," admitted Alice, "but
if Science is at the center of Civilization what is around
the edges?"
"Oh," said the Old Gentleman in a condescending
tone, "we scoop all the nasty little fringes, odds and
ends, and other useless little tid-bits together and call
them the Humanities."
"Humanities, Humanities," said Alice, repeating the
word over to herself to see if she could feel what it
meant; do Humanities make one more human?"
"Hum," said the Old Gentleman in a perplexed voice,
for he hadn't ever considered the problem of being
human very seriously before; "I really don't believe
so—l think it's sort of a coincidence of meaning; or at
least it isn't so unless 'To err is human—'."
But he suddenly broke off, as though the phrase had
reminded him of something very important; and he
began searching nervously through his pockets, ex
tracting quantities of red, green, blue, yellow and
purple printed forms.
"Oh, Heavens!" he exclaimed, "my dear Goat, I've
lost it again." And he reached up and pulled the emer
gency cord.
"Lost what?" asked Alice, as the train came to a very
sudden and uncomfortable stop.
"Our 10:30 late leave slip!" cried the Old Gentleman,
bolting lor the door.
"Oh, the Proxy will he mad!" cried the Goat in n
tortured voice, dashing .after the Old Gentleman.
And they disappeared in the darkness, leaving Alice
all alone.

center of Science."
"Oh!" cried Alice, who was very impressed, "but how
do you learn about Science?"
"Whenever a Scientific problem arises," replied the
Old Gentleman, "we un-freeze a Scientist (Scientists
are sort of round, pink things with spectacles and con
stipation) and transfer it from the ice-box to a small
cubicle or stuffy cubbyhole. Then we add a little corn
meal mush (enriched with vitamins), an adding ma
chine, a slide rule, and a few other well oiled gadgets
and devices. Soon the problem is solved."
"But," said Alice, "how do you tell when the prob
lem is solved?"
"That's very simple," said the Goat, fingering his
beard as though he were infinitely wise, "when a Sci
entist is working it is bluish and slightly frigid; you
can tell when it's finished working because it burbles
noisily and gives off quantities of gas and nauseous
vapor."
"It all sounds very fascinating," admitted Alice, "but
if Science is at the center of Civilization what is around
the edges?"
"Oh," said the Old Gentleman in a condescending
tone, "we scoop all the nasty little fringes, odds and
ends, and other useless little tid-bits together and call
them the Humanities."
"Humanities, Humanities," said Alice, repeating the
word over to herself to see if she could feel what it
meant; do Humanities make one more human?"
"Hum," said the Old Gentleman in a perplexed voice,
for he hadn't ever considered the problem of being
human very seriously before; "I really don't believe
so—l think it's sort of a coincidence of meaning; or at
least it isn't so unless 'To err is human—'."
But he suddenly broke off, as though the phrase had
reminded him of something very important; and he
began searching nervously through his pockets, ex
tracting quantities of red, green, blue, yellow and
purple printed forms.
"Oh, Heavens!" he exclaimed, "my dear Goat, I've
lost it again." And he reached up and pulled the emer
gency cord.
"Lost what?" asked Alice, as the train came to a very
sudden and uncomfortable stop.
"Our 10:30 late leave slip!" cried the Old Gentleman,
bolting lor the door.
"Oh, the Proxy will he mad!" cried the Goat in n
tortured voice, dashing .after the Old Gentleman.
And they disappeared in the darkness, leaving Alice
all alone.

Alice looked up, and saw an ugly head poking in
through the railway carriage window.
The Guard stared rudely about the carriage; he
frowned at the Goat with the white beard (who was
snoring most mellifluously), ho fivowned at the Old
Gentleman (who was all dressed in white paper), and
he frowned at Alice.
"You!" he said in a dry nasal voice, glaring at Alice,
"where's your ticket?"
"Where are your manners!" said Alice, who was too
offended by his behaviour to be afraid of him.
"Paugh, stuff and nonsense!" said the Guard, trying
not to be flustered. And, taking out a large telescope,
he looked at Alice —first through one end of the tele
scope and then through the other.
"You're going the wrong way!" he announced sud
denly, and before Alice could reply he had slammed
the window shut and disappeared.
"But how could he know whether or not I'm going
the right way," said Alice, who was quite puzzled,
"unless he knows where I want to go in the first place?"
"Because he practices Semantics," said the Goat,
waking up with a start.
"I thought people like that were put in jail!" said
Alice, shocked to hear a nice looking Goat mention
such revolting depravities in public.
"Not professors," said the Old Gentleman, "because
they're peculiarly harmless, or harmlessly peculiar; 1
can't quite remember which."
"But the Guard wasn't a professor," said Alice.
"Perhaps not," said the Goat, "but we ore, and we
have no wish to go to jail."
"Oh, how interesting!" cried Alice, "a real live pro
fessor! Do tell me all about what you do."
"It's very complicated," admitted the Goat, furrow
ing his brow as though it really were complicated; "you
see, Science is the center of Civilization, and we're the
center of Science."
"Oh!" cried Alice, who was very impressed, "but how
