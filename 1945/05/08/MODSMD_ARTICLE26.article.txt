THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS
I don't know how many students besides myself have
been following with a great deal of fear and anxiety the
discussions in Congress concerning the renewal of the
Reciprocal Trade Agreements program.
Certainly this program is of sufficient importance
to our future peace and security to warrant at least
a mature consideration by our Congressmen, and the
bickering and personal hatreds that have been ac
companying the efforts to renew this legislation have
been very disheartening to me.
I am nothing but an amateur in the study of eco
nomics, but from the little I do know I have con
cluded that lower tariffs are essential both to our do
mestic economy and to our foreign policy. We
cannot shut out the goods of the rest of the world
without disrupting cooperation among nations. No
matter how much political cooperation we may have,
if we don't also recognize our economic independence,
political relations will break down as having nothing
durable upon which to be based.
It is so clear to me that our high tariffs did con
tribute to the world depression and to this present
war that I can't sit idly by and watch the efforts to
moderate our tariff policy frustrated.
The purpose of this letter is to ask you Stanford
students to endorse this statement of policy: We
favor the renewal of the Reciprocal Trade Agree
ments program. I propose writing a letter to Sena
tor Johnson of California in which we can express
our opinion and ask him to support and fight for
reciprocal trade in the Senate.
I hope that many students will be willing to sign
this letter so that Stanford can put forth a united
effort in the fight for freer trade.
