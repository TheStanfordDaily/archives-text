# Europe's Lessons for Pacific
## 
### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Since we .ire emerging from the
European war into a Pacific one, the
first tusk of the historian is to try
to gain the military lessons taught
during the fight against Nazi Ger
many. Many of these, perhaps, will
he wrongly taught, and many more
were proved or ascertained, not
through inspiration but through
blunders.
Modern tactics are different
from those of previous centuries.
'I hey are not solely a question of
the maneuvering and employment
of troops with technological de
velopment as a mere .sidelight, hut
the struggle of the soldier with
new techniques.
Last War
In the last war, techniques proved
the master. Offensive after offensive
collapsed before the machine gun
and the quick-firing cannon, until
economic strangulation forced Ger
many into capitulation. The last wai
was indeed the most stagnant of any
in history.
Being primarily a war between
rival economies, the defeat of the
losers and near losers was pri
marily economic, and this caused
economic chaos. From that defeat,
new leaders, dedicated to the an
cient principle of "bread, olive oil,
and circuses," arose. Their ten
ure of power was due to their hold
on the masses, and the mass is
emotional rather than rational.
One of the key points of their
high - pressure propaganda machine
was an artificially fostered intense
ness of national spirit. This meant
that the leaders, the Fascist dicta
tors, would have to produce a mili
tant foreign policy, which meant a
perpetual threat of war.
Totalitarian Tactics
A weak economy might have put
the Fascists in, but, if war again
stagnated and became economic in
character, that economy would ruin
them. The Fascists would have to
strike hard and fast, and they devel
oped their tactical theory accord
ingly.
The basis of their theory was a
small, professionally trained army
formed into fast-moving armored di
visions and into an air corps. The
function of the air corps would be
to destroy enemy industry and tan
gle up communications, ard also to
act as close support artillery for the
armored divisions. In the armored
division, the tank was to form the
spearhead, to move forward rapidly
and throw such a volume of fire that
infantry didn't dare stick its heads
abova the rims of its foxholes; to
ride through the enemy line while
light forces of infantry, drawn to the
front in lorries and half-tracks, held
open the breach that the tanks had
made. Conscript infantry masses
came up by foot later, to be sure,
but they were just mere occupiers.
Tests
Excluding Manchuria, the first
test of the theory came in Ethiopia,
and was a miserable failure.
The Italian strategy called for a

twin advancc, one by General De
llono in the north, through the
Tigre country, and the other to
strike up from the south toward
Addis Ababa. The later was in
command of General Graziani.
Both offensives at first were fail
ures. The Ethiopians limited them
selves to guerilla warfare, paralyz
ing the front line troops by inter
rupting the limited flow of supplies
along the wretched mountain tracks
that were the Italian communica
tions. The Negus' strategy was to
keep going "or three months until
the monsoons came in and the eco
nomic strangulation of Italy com
menced through the medium of the
League sanctions.
Things went well. The Italian
strategic Thunderbolts, their
tanks, artillery, and aircraft were
useless because they had no stra
tegic targets to strike at. These
Thunderbolts couldn't go on and
occupy territory because their
gasoline was cut off from them.
But then the Ethiopians became
over-confident, and started launch
ing mass attacks, hoping to win an
other Adowa. The Negris spent
themselves on Fiat machine guns,
were demoralized and routed by air
strafing and mustard
Next Test—Spain
The next proving ground was the
Spanish civil war. The Falange Es
panola, a Fascist revolutionary

group, mobilized the Moroccan ar
mies 'and invaded Spain. At first, the
rebels made headway due to sur
prise. New Falange units were or
ganized inside Spain and moved for
a junction with the main,body. Gen
eral Franco, in command, got sup
port from Germany and Italy in the
form of mechanized units, supplies,
financial aid and advisers.
The Loyalist government reverted
to the Marxian theory of mass and
used hastily trained troops which
were beaten back by infiltration. But
then the Falange forces reached the
key centers of the country, Valen
cia, Barcelona, and Madrid. They
were stopped cold.
It was partly due to General
Franco's ineptitude in handling
mechanized forces and to his mis
takes, which were plentiful, but the
Loyalists, with only a few anti-tank
and machine guns, held off the Fa
lange.
Finally economic strangulation
set in on the Loyalists. Neither
half of Spain, Falange nor Repub
lican, could fight a modern war
economically. The Falange half
got support, but the Loyalists got
none. The war was won, not by
superior tactics, but by one side
starving and running out of am
munition.
This must have given the Fascist
leaders dreary hopes about their
blitz war, but their staff officers
worked out something new to over
come the power of the defensive,
which certainly was proved superior
to that of the tank-paced offensive.
This worked, not only against un
armed Poland, but in France. What
it was is best described by the Eng
lish author, Liddell Hart, who saw
this development clearly.
Liddell Hart
"Before the war, I expressed the
view that to give the offensive rea
sonable prospects of success, the at
tacker would need a superiority ap
proaching three to one in modern
weapons, such as tanks and air
craft. The Germans had more than
that superiority in their attack on
Poland, and, before venturing any
offensive iri the West, they waited
until, by intensified efforts during
the winter, they had built up a still
larger margin of strength in such
modern instruments —fully four to
one, according to authoritative state
ments. Even then, they took care
to avoid a direct attack on the
Maginot Line.
"In successive books during the

past ten years I suggested that
perhaps the best chance of over
coming the hard problem pre
sented by modern defense lay in
exploiting the possibilities of 'the
baited offensive'—the combination
of offensive strategy with defen
sive and counter-ollensive tactics.
By a sudden pounce on strategic
points outside the main front, one
might lure the opposing army into
an ill-considered advance, and
then, when it was out of position,
catch it with a surprise riposte.
The only high command which
showed keen interest in the idea
of this 'gambit of future warfare 1
was the German. Intentionally or
not, their strategy in May (l!)4tl)
proved a perfect fulfillment of it.
"They first lured the British and
French forces into the lowlands,
then smashed through their front at
Sedan, which was only a fagade. . . .
"Despite iheir immense superior
ity in modern means of attack, the
Germans were careful to abstain
from head-on assaults, and to press
their advance only where they could
create 'soft spots.'
"In unreasoning alarm . . . Ihe
Allied leaders called for the Iroops
to reply to the German advance by
'furious, unrelenting assaults,' which
broke clown before the German de
fense."
The Germans abandoned this
wise policy in Russia by going in
head on. Defense in depth can
stop mechanized attacks, as the
Russians showed, and as the Ger
mans seemed to know when they
went around the Maginot Line in
stead of through it. The Germans
wasted their crack units in Russia,
but their only gains were made
when they so dislocated the Rus
sian lines that defense in depth
was impossible.
Similarly, in the Russian counter
offensive, the Russians only struck
at weak points in the enemy lines,

created by Nazi blunders and Rod
feints.
In Africa, the side attacking al
ways seemed to lose. In Pommel's
baited offensive on the Gazala-Bir
Rachiem line, he did not win by
; attack, but by luring the British ar
j mored divisions int-> the muzzles of
i his 88's. At El Alamein, Rommel was
beaten by a series of night attacks
that broke through his pill boxes,
and then by being lured into futile
counter-attacks designed .to regain
his lost positions. g
In Tunisia, he was not beaten ™
until lie had wasted his tanks in
| futile offensive efforts of his own.
In the Normandy beachhead, we
! were held until Von Kluge made
the mistake of dislocating his lines
| by keeping his left extended when
j the link connecting it with the rest
| of his line—the village of St. Lo
j was hammered loose.
At the Siegfried Line, when we
I used the "push of the pike," we
[ simply wasted ourselves to the point
I that the enemy could deliver ;i
| counter-offensive. Then, by attaek-
I ing in a series of lightly defended
places, we won.
Thus the elements which stag
j nated the last war still exist today.
! But they can be overcome by what
1 Liddell Hart has called the "baited
offensive," and by exploiting enemy
soft spots. When we reach the main
enemy armies in the Pacific, there
fore, it would not be wise to go
| head on into their prepared de
! lenses. This can only succeed when
! they have little depth, as on a very
! small atoll. The best idea is to gain
! the home islands, to establish beach
| heads and airfields which put us in
easy, small-plane range of enemy
j industrial plants, and then let him
I suffer economic destruction or else
| attack us. Considering the Japanese
mentality, he will probably do the
I latter, and, as before in the Pacific
war. his formations will disintegrate
before our machine guns.
In Asia proper, the best policy
would he to take advantage of
enemy dispersion and attack at
soft spots in his line. There should
, be plenty of them, since he has to,
defend tiic better part of the whole
mainland of the continent with
only 4,000,000 men. In the future,
it should be remembered that wars
are won not through push, but
j through art.


GERMANY'S FIRST TRIUMPH—First outward Indication that Germany had become a

GERMANY'S FIRST TRIUMPH—First outward Indication that Germany had become a
power again was occupation of the Rhineland, demilitarized by Allies alter World War I.
Here, on March 7. 193fi. are Hitler's troons marchins over Hohenzollern Bridge into Cologne.
Since we .ire emerging from the
European war into a Pacific one, the
first tusk of the historian is to try
to gain the military lessons taught
during the fight against Nazi Ger
many. Many of these, perhaps, will
he wrongly taught, and many more
were proved or ascertained, not
through inspiration but through
blunders.
Modern tactics are different
from those of previous centuries.
'I hey are not solely a question of
the maneuvering and employment
of troops with technological de
velopment as a mere .sidelight, hut
the struggle of the soldier with
new techniques.
Last War
In the last war, techniques proved
the master. Offensive after offensive
collapsed before the machine gun
and the quick-firing cannon, until
economic strangulation forced Ger
many into capitulation. The last wai
was indeed the most stagnant of any
in history.
Being primarily a war between
rival economies, the defeat of the
losers and near losers was pri
marily economic, and this caused
economic chaos. From that defeat,
new leaders, dedicated to the an
cient principle of "bread, olive oil,
and circuses," arose. Their ten
ure of power was due to their hold
on the masses, and the mass is
emotional rather than rational.
One of the key points of their
high - pressure propaganda machine
was an artificially fostered intense
ness of national spirit. This meant
that the leaders, the Fascist dicta
tors, would have to produce a mili
tant foreign policy, which meant a
perpetual threat of war.
Totalitarian Tactics
A weak economy might have put
the Fascists in, but, if war again
stagnated and became economic in
character, that economy would ruin
them. The Fascists would have to
strike hard and fast, and they devel
oped their tactical theory accord
ingly.
The basis of their theory was a
small, professionally trained army
formed into fast-moving armored di
visions and into an air corps. The
function of the air corps would be
to destroy enemy industry and tan
gle up communications, ard also to
act as close support artillery for the
armored divisions. In the armored
division, the tank was to form the
spearhead, to move forward rapidly
and throw such a volume of fire that
infantry didn't dare stick its heads
abova the rims of its foxholes; to
ride through the enemy line while
light forces of infantry, drawn to the
front in lorries and half-tracks, held
open the breach that the tanks had
made. Conscript infantry masses
came up by foot later, to be sure,
but they were just mere occupiers.
Tests
Excluding Manchuria, the first
test of the theory came in Ethiopia,
and was a miserable failure.
The Italian strategy called for a

twin advancc, one by General De
llono in the north, through the
Tigre country, and the other to
strike up from the south toward
Addis Ababa. The later was in
command of General Graziani.
Both offensives at first were fail
ures. The Ethiopians limited them
selves to guerilla warfare, paralyz
ing the front line troops by inter
rupting the limited flow of supplies
along the wretched mountain tracks
that were the Italian communica
tions. The Negus' strategy was to
keep going "or three months until
the monsoons came in and the eco
nomic strangulation of Italy com
menced through the medium of the
League sanctions.
Things went well. The Italian
strategic Thunderbolts, their
tanks, artillery, and aircraft were
useless because they had no stra
tegic targets to strike at. These
Thunderbolts couldn't go on and
occupy territory because their
gasoline was cut off from them.
But then the Ethiopians became
over-confident, and started launch
ing mass attacks, hoping to win an
other Adowa. The Negris spent
themselves on Fiat machine guns,
were demoralized and routed by air
strafing and mustard
Next Test—Spain
The next proving ground was the
Spanish civil war. The Falange Es
panola, a Fascist revolutionary

group, mobilized the Moroccan ar
mies 'and invaded Spain. At first, the
rebels made headway due to sur
prise. New Falange units were or
ganized inside Spain and moved for
a junction with the main,body. Gen
eral Franco, in command, got sup
port from Germany and Italy in the
form of mechanized units, supplies,
financial aid and advisers.
The Loyalist government reverted
to the Marxian theory of mass and
used hastily trained troops which
were beaten back by infiltration. But
then the Falange forces reached the
key centers of the country, Valen
cia, Barcelona, and Madrid. They
were stopped cold.
It was partly due to General
Franco's ineptitude in handling
mechanized forces and to his mis
takes, which were plentiful, but the
Loyalists, with only a few anti-tank
and machine guns, held off the Fa
lange.
Finally economic strangulation
set in on the Loyalists. Neither
half of Spain, Falange nor Repub
lican, could fight a modern war
economically. The Falange half
got support, but the Loyalists got
none. The war was won, not by
superior tactics, but by one side
starving and running out of am
munition.
This must have given the Fascist
leaders dreary hopes about their
blitz war, but their staff officers
worked out something new to over
come the power of the defensive,
which certainly was proved superior
to that of the tank-paced offensive.
This worked, not only against un
armed Poland, but in France. What
it was is best described by the Eng
lish author, Liddell Hart, who saw
this development clearly.
Liddell Hart
"Before the war, I expressed the
view that to give the offensive rea
sonable prospects of success, the at
tacker would need a superiority ap
proaching three to one in modern
weapons, such as tanks and air
craft. The Germans had more than
that superiority in their attack on
Poland, and, before venturing any
offensive iri the West, they waited
until, by intensified efforts during
the winter, they had built up a still
larger margin of strength in such
modern instruments —fully four to
one, according to authoritative state
ments. Even then, they took care
to avoid a direct attack on the
Maginot Line.
"In successive books during the

past ten years I suggested that
perhaps the best chance of over
coming the hard problem pre
sented by modern defense lay in
exploiting the possibilities of 'the
baited offensive'—the combination
of offensive strategy with defen
sive and counter-ollensive tactics.
By a sudden pounce on strategic
points outside the main front, one
might lure the opposing army into
an ill-considered advance, and
then, when it was out of position,
catch it with a surprise riposte.
The only high command which
showed keen interest in the idea
of this 'gambit of future warfare 1
was the German. Intentionally or
not, their strategy in May (l!)4tl)
proved a perfect fulfillment of it.
"They first lured the British and
French forces into the lowlands,
then smashed through their front at
Sedan, which was only a fagade. . . .
"Despite iheir immense superior
ity in modern means of attack, the
Germans were careful to abstain
from head-on assaults, and to press
their advance only where they could
create 'soft spots.'
"In unreasoning alarm . . . Ihe
Allied leaders called for the Iroops
to reply to the German advance by
'furious, unrelenting assaults,' which
broke clown before the German de
fense."
The Germans abandoned this
wise policy in Russia by going in
head on. Defense in depth can
stop mechanized attacks, as the
Russians showed, and as the Ger
mans seemed to know when they
went around the Maginot Line in
stead of through it. The Germans
wasted their crack units in Russia,
but their only gains were made
when they so dislocated the Rus
sian lines that defense in depth
was impossible.
Similarly, in the Russian counter
offensive, the Russians only struck
at weak points in the enemy lines,

created by Nazi blunders and Rod
feints.
In Africa, the side attacking al
ways seemed to lose. In Pommel's
baited offensive on the Gazala-Bir
Rachiem line, he did not win by
; attack, but by luring the British ar
j mored divisions int-> the muzzles of
i his 88's. At El Alamein, Rommel was
beaten by a series of night attacks
that broke through his pill boxes,
and then by being lured into futile
counter-attacks designed .to regain
his lost positions. g
In Tunisia, he was not beaten ™
until lie had wasted his tanks in
| futile offensive efforts of his own.
In the Normandy beachhead, we
! were held until Von Kluge made
the mistake of dislocating his lines
| by keeping his left extended when
j the link connecting it with the rest
| of his line—the village of St. Lo
j was hammered loose.
At the Siegfried Line, when we
I used the "push of the pike," we
[ simply wasted ourselves to the point
I that the enemy could deliver ;i
| counter-offensive. Then, by attaek-
I ing in a series of lightly defended
places, we won.
Thus the elements which stag
j nated the last war still exist today.
! But they can be overcome by what
1 Liddell Hart has called the "baited
offensive," and by exploiting enemy
soft spots. When we reach the main
enemy armies in the Pacific, there
fore, it would not be wise to go
| head on into their prepared de
! lenses. This can only succeed when
! they have little depth, as on a very
! small atoll. The best idea is to gain
! the home islands, to establish beach
| heads and airfields which put us in
easy, small-plane range of enemy
j industrial plants, and then let him
I suffer economic destruction or else

mentality, he will probably do the
I latter, and, as before in the Pacific
war. his formations will disintegrate
before our machine guns.

GERMANY'S FIRST TRIUMPH—First outward Indication that Germany had become a
power again was occupation of the Rhineland, demilitarized by Allies alter World War I.
Here, on March 7. 193fi. are Hitler's troons marchins over Hohenzollern Bridge into Cologne.
Since we .ire emerging from the
European war into a Pacific one, the
first tusk of the historian is to try
to gain the military lessons taught
during the fight against Nazi Ger
many. Many of these, perhaps, will
he wrongly taught, and many more
were proved or ascertained, not
through inspiration but through
blunders.
Modern tactics are different
from those of previous centuries.
'I hey are not solely a question of
the maneuvering and employment
of troops with technological de
velopment as a mere .sidelight, hut
the struggle of the soldier with
new techniques.
Last War
In the last war, techniques proved
the master. Offensive after offensive
collapsed before the machine gun
and the quick-firing cannon, until
economic strangulation forced Ger
many into capitulation. The last wai
was indeed the most stagnant of any
in history.
Being primarily a war between
rival economies, the defeat of the
losers and near losers was pri
marily economic, and this caused
economic chaos. From that defeat,
new leaders, dedicated to the an
cient principle of "bread, olive oil,
and circuses," arose. Their ten
ure of power was due to their hold
on the masses, and the mass is
emotional rather than rational.
One of the key points of their
high - pressure propaganda machine
was an artificially fostered intense
ness of national spirit. This meant
that the leaders, the Fascist dicta
tors, would have to produce a mili
tant foreign policy, which meant a
perpetual threat of war.
Totalitarian Tactics
A weak economy might have put
the Fascists in, but, if war again
stagnated and became economic in
character, that economy would ruin
them. The Fascists would have to
strike hard and fast, and they devel
oped their tactical theory accord
ingly.
The basis of their theory was a
small, professionally trained army
formed into fast-moving armored di
visions and into an air corps. The
function of the air corps would be
to destroy enemy industry and tan
gle up communications, ard also to
act as close support artillery for the
armored divisions. In the armored
division, the tank was to form the
spearhead, to move forward rapidly
and throw such a volume of fire that
infantry didn't dare stick its heads
abova the rims of its foxholes; to
ride through the enemy line while
light forces of infantry, drawn to the
front in lorries and half-tracks, held
open the breach that the tanks had
made. Conscript infantry masses
came up by foot later, to be sure,
but they were just mere occupiers.
Tests
Excluding Manchuria, the first
test of the theory came in Ethiopia,
and was a miserable failure.
The Italian strategy called for a

twin advancc, one by General De
llono in the north, through the
Tigre country, and the other to
strike up from the south toward
Addis Ababa. The later was in
command of General Graziani.
Both offensives at first were fail
ures. The Ethiopians limited them
selves to guerilla warfare, paralyz
ing the front line troops by inter
rupting the limited flow of supplies
along the wretched mountain tracks
that were the Italian communica
tions. The Negus' strategy was to
keep going "or three months until
the monsoons came in and the eco
nomic strangulation of Italy com
menced through the medium of the
League sanctions.
Things went well. The Italian
strategic Thunderbolts, their
tanks, artillery, and aircraft were
useless because they had no stra
tegic targets to strike at. These
Thunderbolts couldn't go on and
occupy territory because their
gasoline was cut off from them.
But then the Ethiopians became
over-confident, and started launch
ing mass attacks, hoping to win an
other Adowa. The Negris spent
themselves on Fiat machine guns,
were demoralized and routed by air
strafing and mustard
Next Test—Spain
The next proving ground was the
Spanish civil war. The Falange Es
panola, a Fascist revolutionary

group, mobilized the Moroccan ar
mies 'and invaded Spain. At first, the
rebels made headway due to sur
prise. New Falange units were or
ganized inside Spain and moved for
a junction with the main,body. Gen
eral Franco, in command, got sup
port from Germany and Italy in the
form of mechanized units, supplies,
financial aid and advisers.
The Loyalist government reverted
to the Marxian theory of mass and
used hastily trained troops which
were beaten back by infiltration. But
then the Falange forces reached the
key centers of the country, Valen
cia, Barcelona, and Madrid. They
were stopped cold.
It was partly due to General
Franco's ineptitude in handling
mechanized forces and to his mis
takes, which were plentiful, but the
Loyalists, with only a few anti-tank
and machine guns, held off the Fa
lange.
Finally economic strangulation
set in on the Loyalists. Neither
half of Spain, Falange nor Repub
lican, could fight a modern war
economically. The Falange half
got support, but the Loyalists got
none. The war was won, not by
superior tactics, but by one side
starving and running out of am
munition.
This must have given the Fascist
leaders dreary hopes about their
blitz war, but their staff officers
worked out something new to over
come the power of the defensive,
which certainly was proved superior
to that of the tank-paced offensive.
This worked, not only against un
armed Poland, but in France. What
it was is best described by the Eng
lish author, Liddell Hart, who saw
this development clearly.
Liddell Hart
"Before the war, I expressed the
view that to give the offensive rea
sonable prospects of success, the at
tacker would need a superiority ap
proaching three to one in modern
weapons, such as tanks and air
craft. The Germans had more than
that superiority in their attack on
Poland, and, before venturing any
offensive iri the West, they waited
until, by intensified efforts during
the winter, they had built up a still
larger margin of strength in such
modern instruments —fully four to
one, according to authoritative state
ments. Even then, they took care
to avoid a direct attack on the
Maginot Line.
"In successive books during the

past ten years I suggested that
perhaps the best chance of over
coming the hard problem pre
sented by modern defense lay in
exploiting the possibilities of 'the
baited offensive'—the combination
of offensive strategy with defen
sive and counter-ollensive tactics.
By a sudden pounce on strategic
points outside the main front, one
might lure the opposing army into
an ill-considered advance, and
then, when it was out of position,
catch it with a surprise riposte.
The only high command which
showed keen interest in the idea
of this 'gambit of future warfare 1
was the German. Intentionally or
not, their strategy in May (l!)4tl)
proved a perfect fulfillment of it.
"They first lured the British and
French forces into the lowlands,
then smashed through their front at
Sedan, which was only a fagade. . . .
"Despite iheir immense superior
ity in modern means of attack, the
Germans were careful to abstain
from head-on assaults, and to press
their advance only where they could
create 'soft spots.'
"In unreasoning alarm . . . Ihe
Allied leaders called for the Iroops
to reply to the German advance by
'furious, unrelenting assaults,' which
broke clown before the German de
fense."
The Germans abandoned this
wise policy in Russia by going in
head on. Defense in depth can
stop mechanized attacks, as the
Russians showed, and as the Ger
mans seemed to know when they
went around the Maginot Line in
stead of through it. The Germans
wasted their crack units in Russia,
but their only gains were made
when they so dislocated the Rus
sian lines that defense in depth
was impossible.
Similarly, in the Russian counter
offensive, the Russians only struck
at weak points in the enemy lines,

created by Nazi blunders and Rod
feints.
In Africa, the side attacking al
ways seemed to lose. In Pommel's
baited offensive on the Gazala-Bir
Rachiem line, he did not win by
; attack, but by luring the British ar
j mored divisions int-> the muzzles of
i his 88's. At El Alamein, Rommel was
beaten by a series of night attacks
that broke through his pill boxes,
and then by being lured into futile
counter-attacks designed .to regain
his lost positions. g
In Tunisia, he was not beaten ™
until lie had wasted his tanks in
| futile offensive efforts of his own.
In the Normandy beachhead, we
! were held until Von Kluge made
the mistake of dislocating his lines
| by keeping his left extended when
j the link connecting it with the rest
| of his line—the village of St. Lo
j was hammered loose.
At the Siegfried Line, when we
I used the "push of the pike," we
[ simply wasted ourselves to the point
I that the enemy could deliver ;i
| counter-offensive. Then, by attaek-
I ing in a series of lightly defended
places, we won.
Thus the elements which stag
j nated the last war still exist today.
! But they can be overcome by what
1 Liddell Hart has called the "baited
offensive," and by exploiting enemy
soft spots. When we reach the main

GERMANY'S FIRST TRIUMPH—First outward Indication that Germany had become a
power again was occupation of the Rhineland, demilitarized by Allies alter World War I.
Here, on March 7. 193fi. are Hitler's troons marchins over Hohenzollern Bridge into Cologne.
Since we .ire emerging from the
European war into a Pacific one, the
first tusk of the historian is to try
to gain the military lessons taught
during the fight against Nazi Ger
many. Many of these, perhaps, will
he wrongly taught, and many more
were proved or ascertained, not
through inspiration but through
blunders.
Modern tactics are different
from those of previous centuries.
'I hey are not solely a question of
the maneuvering and employment
of troops with technological de
velopment as a mere .sidelight, hut
the struggle of the soldier with
new techniques.
Last War
In the last war, techniques proved
the master. Offensive after offensive
collapsed before the machine gun
and the quick-firing cannon, until
economic strangulation forced Ger
many into capitulation. The last wai
was indeed the most stagnant of any
in history.
Being primarily a war between
rival economies, the defeat of the
losers and near losers was pri
marily economic, and this caused
economic chaos. From that defeat,
new leaders, dedicated to the an
cient principle of "bread, olive oil,
and circuses," arose. Their ten
ure of power was due to their hold
on the masses, and the mass is
emotional rather than rational.
One of the key points of their
high - pressure propaganda machine
was an artificially fostered intense
ness of national spirit. This meant
that the leaders, the Fascist dicta
tors, would have to produce a mili
tant foreign policy, which meant a
perpetual threat of war.
Totalitarian Tactics
A weak economy might have put
the Fascists in, but, if war again
stagnated and became economic in
character, that economy would ruin
them. The Fascists would have to
strike hard and fast, and they devel
oped their tactical theory accord
ingly.
The basis of their theory was a
small, professionally trained army
formed into fast-moving armored di
visions and into an air corps. The
function of the air corps would be
to destroy enemy industry and tan
gle up communications, ard also to
act as close support artillery for the
armored divisions. In the armored
division, the tank was to form the
spearhead, to move forward rapidly
and throw such a volume of fire that
infantry didn't dare stick its heads
abova the rims of its foxholes; to
ride through the enemy line while
light forces of infantry, drawn to the
front in lorries and half-tracks, held
open the breach that the tanks had
made. Conscript infantry masses
came up by foot later, to be sure,
but they were just mere occupiers.
Tests
Excluding Manchuria, the first
test of the theory came in Ethiopia,
and was a miserable failure.
The Italian strategy called for a

twin advancc, one by General De
llono in the north, through the
Tigre country, and the other to
strike up from the south toward
Addis Ababa. The later was in
command of General Graziani.
Both offensives at first were fail
ures. The Ethiopians limited them
selves to guerilla warfare, paralyz
ing the front line troops by inter
rupting the limited flow of supplies
along the wretched mountain tracks
that were the Italian communica
tions. The Negus' strategy was to
keep going "or three months until
the monsoons came in and the eco
nomic strangulation of Italy com
menced through the medium of the
League sanctions.
Things went well. The Italian
strategic Thunderbolts, their
tanks, artillery, and aircraft were
useless because they had no stra
tegic targets to strike at. These
Thunderbolts couldn't go on and
occupy territory because their
gasoline was cut off from them.
But then the Ethiopians became
over-confident, and started launch
ing mass attacks, hoping to win an
other Adowa. The Negris spent
themselves on Fiat machine guns,
were demoralized and routed by air
strafing and mustard
Next Test—Spain
The next proving ground was the
Spanish civil war. The Falange Es
panola, a Fascist revolutionary

group, mobilized the Moroccan ar
mies 'and invaded Spain. At first, the
rebels made headway due to sur
prise. New Falange units were or
ganized inside Spain and moved for
a junction with the main,body. Gen
eral Franco, in command, got sup
port from Germany and Italy in the
form of mechanized units, supplies,
financial aid and advisers.
The Loyalist government reverted
to the Marxian theory of mass and
used hastily trained troops which
were beaten back by infiltration. But
then the Falange forces reached the
key centers of the country, Valen
cia, Barcelona, and Madrid. They
were stopped cold.
It was partly due to General
Franco's ineptitude in handling
mechanized forces and to his mis
takes, which were plentiful, but the
Loyalists, with only a few anti-tank
and machine guns, held off the Fa
lange.
Finally economic strangulation
set in on the Loyalists. Neither
half of Spain, Falange nor Repub
lican, could fight a modern war
economically. The Falange half
got support, but the Loyalists got
none. The war was won, not by
superior tactics, but by one side
starving and running out of am
munition.
This must have given the Fascist
leaders dreary hopes about their
blitz war, but their staff officers
worked out something new to over
come the power of the defensive,
which certainly was proved superior
to that of the tank-paced offensive.
This worked, not only against un
armed Poland, but in France. What
it was is best described by the Eng
lish author, Liddell Hart, who saw
this development clearly.
Liddell Hart
"Before the war, I expressed the
view that to give the offensive rea
sonable prospects of success, the at
tacker would need a superiority ap
proaching three to one in modern
weapons, such as tanks and air
craft. The Germans had more than
that superiority in their attack on
Poland, and, before venturing any
offensive iri the West, they waited
until, by intensified efforts during
the winter, they had built up a still
larger margin of strength in such
modern instruments —fully four to
one, according to authoritative state
ments. Even then, they took care
to avoid a direct attack on the
Maginot Line.
"In successive books during the

past ten years I suggested that
perhaps the best chance of over
coming the hard problem pre
sented by modern defense lay in
exploiting the possibilities of 'the
baited offensive'—the combination
of offensive strategy with defen
sive and counter-ollensive tactics.
By a sudden pounce on strategic
points outside the main front, one
might lure the opposing army into
an ill-considered advance, and
then, when it was out of position,
catch it with a surprise riposte.
The only high command which
showed keen interest in the idea
of this 'gambit of future warfare 1
was the German. Intentionally or
not, their strategy in May (l!)4tl)
proved a perfect fulfillment of it.
"They first lured the British and
French forces into the lowlands,
then smashed through their front at
Sedan, which was only a fagade. . . .
"Despite iheir immense superior
ity in modern means of attack, the
Germans were careful to abstain
from head-on assaults, and to press
their advance only where they could
create 'soft spots.'
"In unreasoning alarm . . . Ihe
Allied leaders called for the Iroops
to reply to the German advance by
'furious, unrelenting assaults,' which
broke clown before the German de
fense."
The Germans abandoned this
wise policy in Russia by going in
head on. Defense in depth can
stop mechanized attacks, as the
Russians showed, and as the Ger
mans seemed to know when they
went around the Maginot Line in
stead of through it. The Germans
wasted their crack units in Russia,
but their only gains were made
when they so dislocated the Rus
sian lines that defense in depth
was impossible.
Similarly, in the Russian counter
offensive, the Russians only struck
at weak points in the enemy lines,

created by Nazi blunders and Rod
feints.
In Africa, the side attacking al
ways seemed to lose. In Pommel's
baited offensive on the Gazala-Bir
Rachiem line, he did not win by
; attack, but by luring the British ar
j mored divisions int-> the muzzles of
i his 88's. At El Alamein, Rommel was
beaten by a series of night attacks
that broke through his pill boxes,
and then by being lured into futile
counter-attacks designed .to regain
his lost positions. g
In Tunisia, he was not beaten ™
until lie had wasted his tanks in
| futile offensive efforts of his own.
In the Normandy beachhead, we
! were held until Von Kluge made
the mistake of dislocating his lines

GERMANY'S FIRST TRIUMPH—First outward Indication that Germany had become a
power again was occupation of the Rhineland, demilitarized by Allies alter World War I.
Here, on March 7. 193fi. are Hitler's troons marchins over Hohenzollern Bridge into Cologne.
Since we .ire emerging from the
European war into a Pacific one, the
first tusk of the historian is to try
to gain the military lessons taught
during the fight against Nazi Ger
many. Many of these, perhaps, will
he wrongly taught, and many more
were proved or ascertained, not
through inspiration but through
blunders.
Modern tactics are different
from those of previous centuries.
'I hey are not solely a question of
the maneuvering and employment
of troops with technological de
velopment as a mere .sidelight, hut
the struggle of the soldier with
new techniques.
Last War
In the last war, techniques proved
the master. Offensive after offensive
collapsed before the machine gun
and the quick-firing cannon, until
economic strangulation forced Ger
many into capitulation. The last wai
was indeed the most stagnant of any
in history.
Being primarily a war between
rival economies, the defeat of the
losers and near losers was pri
marily economic, and this caused
economic chaos. From that defeat,
new leaders, dedicated to the an
cient principle of "bread, olive oil,
and circuses," arose. Their ten
ure of power was due to their hold
on the masses, and the mass is
emotional rather than rational.
One of the key points of their
high - pressure propaganda machine
was an artificially fostered intense
ness of national spirit. This meant
that the leaders, the Fascist dicta
tors, would have to produce a mili
tant foreign policy, which meant a
perpetual threat of war.
Totalitarian Tactics
A weak economy might have put
the Fascists in, but, if war again
stagnated and became economic in
character, that economy would ruin
them. The Fascists would have to
strike hard and fast, and they devel
oped their tactical theory accord
ingly.
The basis of their theory was a
small, professionally trained army
formed into fast-moving armored di
visions and into an air corps. The
function of the air corps would be
to destroy enemy industry and tan
gle up communications, ard also to
act as close support artillery for the
armored divisions. In the armored
division, the tank was to form the
spearhead, to move forward rapidly
and throw such a volume of fire that
infantry didn't dare stick its heads
abova the rims of its foxholes; to
ride through the enemy line while
light forces of infantry, drawn to the
front in lorries and half-tracks, held
open the breach that the tanks had
made. Conscript infantry masses
came up by foot later, to be sure,
but they were just mere occupiers.
Tests
Excluding Manchuria, the first
test of the theory came in Ethiopia,
and was a miserable failure.
The Italian strategy called for a

twin advancc, one by General De
llono in the north, through the
Tigre country, and the other to
strike up from the south toward
Addis Ababa. The later was in
command of General Graziani.
Both offensives at first were fail
ures. The Ethiopians limited them
selves to guerilla warfare, paralyz
ing the front line troops by inter
rupting the limited flow of supplies
along the wretched mountain tracks
that were the Italian communica
tions. The Negus' strategy was to
keep going "or three months until
the monsoons came in and the eco
nomic strangulation of Italy com
menced through the medium of the
League sanctions.
Things went well. The Italian
strategic Thunderbolts, their
tanks, artillery, and aircraft were
useless because they had no stra
tegic targets to strike at. These
Thunderbolts couldn't go on and
occupy territory because their
gasoline was cut off from them.
But then the Ethiopians became
over-confident, and started launch
ing mass attacks, hoping to win an
other Adowa. The Negris spent
themselves on Fiat machine guns,
were demoralized and routed by air
strafing and mustard
Next Test—Spain
The next proving ground was the
Spanish civil war. The Falange Es
panola, a Fascist revolutionary

group, mobilized the Moroccan ar
mies 'and invaded Spain. At first, the
rebels made headway due to sur
prise. New Falange units were or
ganized inside Spain and moved for
a junction with the main,body. Gen
eral Franco, in command, got sup
port from Germany and Italy in the
form of mechanized units, supplies,
financial aid and advisers.
The Loyalist government reverted
to the Marxian theory of mass and
used hastily trained troops which
were beaten back by infiltration. But
then the Falange forces reached the
key centers of the country, Valen
cia, Barcelona, and Madrid. They
were stopped cold.
It was partly due to General
Franco's ineptitude in handling
mechanized forces and to his mis
takes, which were plentiful, but the
Loyalists, with only a few anti-tank
and machine guns, held off the Fa
lange.
Finally economic strangulation
set in on the Loyalists. Neither
half of Spain, Falange nor Repub
lican, could fight a modern war
economically. The Falange half
got support, but the Loyalists got
none. The war was won, not by
superior tactics, but by one side
starving and running out of am
munition.
This must have given the Fascist
leaders dreary hopes about their
blitz war, but their staff officers
worked out something new to over
come the power of the defensive,
which certainly was proved superior
to that of the tank-paced offensive.
This worked, not only against un
armed Poland, but in France. What
it was is best described by the Eng
lish author, Liddell Hart, who saw
this development clearly.
Liddell Hart
"Before the war, I expressed the
view that to give the offensive rea
sonable prospects of success, the at
tacker would need a superiority ap
proaching three to one in modern
weapons, such as tanks and air
craft. The Germans had more than
that superiority in their attack on
Poland, and, before venturing any
offensive iri the West, they waited
until, by intensified efforts during
the winter, they had built up a still
larger margin of strength in such
modern instruments —fully four to
one, according to authoritative state
ments. Even then, they took care
to avoid a direct attack on the
Maginot Line.
"In successive books during the

past ten years I suggested that
perhaps the best chance of over
coming the hard problem pre
sented by modern defense lay in
exploiting the possibilities of 'the
baited offensive'—the combination
of offensive strategy with defen
sive and counter-ollensive tactics.
By a sudden pounce on strategic
points outside the main front, one
might lure the opposing army into
an ill-considered advance, and
then, when it was out of position,
catch it with a surprise riposte.
The only high command which
showed keen interest in the idea
of this 'gambit of future warfare 1
was the German. Intentionally or
not, their strategy in May (l!)4tl)
proved a perfect fulfillment of it.
"They first lured the British and
French forces into the lowlands,
then smashed through their front at
Sedan, which was only a fagade. . . .
"Despite iheir immense superior
ity in modern means of attack, the
Germans were careful to abstain
from head-on assaults, and to press
their advance only where they could
create 'soft spots.'
"In unreasoning alarm . . . Ihe
Allied leaders called for the Iroops
to reply to the German advance by
'furious, unrelenting assaults,' which
broke clown before the German de
fense."
The Germans abandoned this
wise policy in Russia by going in
head on. Defense in depth can
stop mechanized attacks, as the
Russians showed, and as the Ger
mans seemed to know when they
went around the Maginot Line in
stead of through it. The Germans
wasted their crack units in Russia,
but their only gains were made
when they so dislocated the Rus
sian lines that defense in depth
was impossible.
Similarly, in the Russian counter
offensive, the Russians only struck
at weak points in the enemy lines,

created by Nazi blunders and Rod
feints.
In Africa, the side attacking al
ways seemed to lose. In Pommel's
baited offensive on the Gazala-Bir
Rachiem line, he did not win by
; attack, but by luring the British ar
j mored divisions int-> the muzzles of
i his 88's. At El Alamein, Rommel was

stop mechanized attacks, as the
Russians showed, and as the Ger
mans seemed to know when they
went around the Maginot Line in
stead of through it. The Germans
wasted their crack units in Russia,
but their only gains were made
when they so dislocated the Rus
sian lines that defense in depth
was impossible.
Similarly, in the Russian counter
offensive, the Russians only struck
at weak points in the enemy lines,

created by Nazi blunders and Rod
feints.
In Africa, the side attacking al
ways seemed to lose. In Pommel's
baited offensive on the Gazala-Bir
Rachiem line, he did not win by
; attack, but by luring the British ar
j mored divisions int-> the muzzles of
i his 88's. At El Alamein, Rommel was
beaten by a series of night attacks
that broke through his pill boxes,
and then by being lured into futile
counter-attacks designed .to regain
his lost positions. g
In Tunisia, he was not beaten ™
until lie had wasted his tanks in
| futile offensive efforts of his own.
In the Normandy beachhead, we
! were held until Von Kluge made
the mistake of dislocating his lines
| by keeping his left extended when
j the link connecting it with the rest
| of his line—the village of St. Lo
j was hammered loose.
At the Siegfried Line, when we
I used the "push of the pike," we
[ simply wasted ourselves to the point
I that the enemy could deliver ;i
| counter-offensive. Then, by attaek-
I ing in a series of lightly defended
places, we won.
Thus the elements which stag
j nated the last war still exist today.
! But they can be overcome by what
1 Liddell Hart has called the "baited
offensive," and by exploiting enemy
soft spots. When we reach the main
enemy armies in the Pacific, there
fore, it would not be wise to go
| head on into their prepared de
! lenses. This can only succeed when
! they have little depth, as on a very
! small atoll. The best idea is to gain
! the home islands, to establish beach
| heads and airfields which put us in
easy, small-plane range of enemy
j industrial plants, and then let him
I suffer economic destruction or else
| attack us. Considering the Japanese
mentality, he will probably do the
I latter, and, as before in the Pacific
war. his formations will disintegrate
before our machine guns.
In Asia proper, the best policy
would he to take advantage of
enemy dispersion and attack at
soft spots in his line. There should
, be plenty of them, since he has to,
defend tiic better part of the whole
mainland of the continent with
only 4,000,000 men. In the future,
it should be remembered that wars
are won not through push, but
j through art.
