# Cellar Needs More Hashers to Slay Open
## 
### 
According to official sources, a
crisis has developed in the Cellar,
which can be solved only by Farm
guys and gals, especially guys.
Students who turn out to avoid
the closing of the Cellar in the
evenings, will not only receive the
thanks of their fellow students,
but will be paid, in cash, at the
rate of (!0 cents per hour.
All persons interested in helping
keep this student project in oper
ation by working evenings from
5) to 11 either on the counter or
in the dish room, should contact
Alice Tuttle as soon as possible.
