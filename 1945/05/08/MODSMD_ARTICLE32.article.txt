# Farm Grad Tells School Life at Jap Prison Camp
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
"After our chalk was gone, we
painted the blackboards white and
used charcoal. The children tied
string around their precious pencil
stubs and wore them to bed at
night." Bert Silen, NBC war corre
spondent and Stanford graduate, was
telling of the unique schools in the
Santo Tomas concentration camp,
lie was speaking at the San Fran
cisco Press Club.
There were 500 children in camp
and lots of teachers. "It wasn't hard
to bring them together in that
cramped space," he continued wryly.
Everyone was eager to learn, and
the classes ranged from kindergarten
to adult education classes.
The biggest fight was convincing

the Japs that this was not anti-Jap
propaganda, and for two years the
prisoners managed well. Several
teachers obtained passes to go out
and collect abandoned erasers and
textbooks. Soon they were ready to
set up school, and they taught ev
erything from spelling to gold-min
ing. But all lectures had to be sub
mitted to the Japs in advance, and
most classes were held under the
trees for lack of classroom space.
Impromptu Graduation
Two of Mr. Silen's own daughters
graduated from the STIC (Santo To
mas Internment Camp) High School.
Betty, the eldest, graduated in 1948,
and Shirley followed a year later.
The prisoners used all their inge

nuity on the elaborate graduations.
Shirley's class gave a class play and
class history, and the girls wore
white dresses made from old table
cloths. They even received minia
ture diplomas. An architect had cut
the blank squares from some old di
plomas, had sketched the towers of
Santo Tomas as a background, and
then had inscribed the traditional
graduation formula.
Mr. Silen told gleefully of the
hated bowing ceremony. Whenever
the Japanese commandant visited a
class, everyone was required to bow;
and they plotted revenge. Long
rows of children would line up be
fore the sentry, and one by one they
would bow ceremoniously. Of course
the sentry had to return each bow.
Several sentries were known to de
sert their posts when they saw the
children coming.
Souvenir Days
School was finally stopped just be
fore the Americans recaptured Santo
Tomas. The last school days were
exciting ones. Anti-aircraft frag
ments sometimes flew through the
roofs. But the only casualties came
when the children scrambled for
these souvenirs.
Then came the day of liberation
and Mr. Silen's famous radio sign
on. "As I was saying when I was
so rudely interrupted three years
agoâ€”the Japs are losing this war."
Mr. Silen was flown back to the
United tSates, and his family is ex
pected to arrive soon. Both Betty
and Shirley intend to come to Stan
ford.
