### LORRY LOKEY 
Twenty-seven years of service to
the University—that is the record of
Frank B. de Lemos, acting director
of the Museum of Fine Arts and the
Art Gallery, who will retire next
August.
Mr. de Lemos came to Stanford in
1918 when a number of the depart
ments in the Museum were still in a
chaotic condition as a result of the
earthquake of 1906. Rooms such as
the Egyptian Room and the Stan
ford Memorial Room were all re
stored to presentable condition, and
at the same time the Art Gallery
was opened to the public.
Museum Oldest Building
Built in 1891, the Museum is one
of the oldest buildings on the cam
pus. Unlike the school itself, the
Museum remains open twelve
months a year to the public and
students. Mr. de Lemos' job has
been the taking care of all exhibits
and the arranging of current exhib
its in both the art gallery and the
museum.
Asked how he felt after serving so
many years at one job, Mr. de Lemos
replied, "I have enjoyed the work
here through the years, and I be
lieve that I have benefitted from it.
However, I am looking forward to
the change when I retire next Au
gust.
Artist in Bay Area
Before coming to Stanford, Mr, de
Lemos was a commercial artist in
San Francisco and Oakland. He also
taught art at the San Francisco In
stitute of Art during the summer
semesters. Even after coming here,
he went to Chicago during a few of
the summer vacations. There he
taught art, lettering, design, and art
crafts in a private accredited school.

When this interviewer asked him
if many people from other states
visited the Museum, Mr. de Lemos
seized the opportunity to show sev
eral of the guest volumes signed by
the many visitors. People hailing all
of the way from Maine to Hawaii
had affixed their signatures. The
signatures of four delegates from El
Salvador to the San Francisco Con
ference were among the many dis
tant visitors.
Ratio (s Biggest Change
"The biggest change that I have
noticed during my time here at
Stanford," he said, "is the large
number of girls and the scarcity of
fellows." Yes, there ARE a large
number of girls around, aren't
there?

stitute of Art during the summer
semesters. Even after coming here,
he went to Chicago during a few of
the summer vacations. There he
taught art, lettering, design, and art
crafts in a private accredited school.

When this interviewer asked him
if many people from other states
visited the Museum, Mr. de Lemos
seized the opportunity to show sev
eral of the guest volumes signed by
the many visitors. People hailing all
of the way from Maine to Hawaii
had affixed their signatures. The
signatures of four delegates from El
Salvador to the San Francisco Con
ference were among the many dis
tant visitors.
Ratio (s Biggest Change
"The biggest change that I have
noticed during my time here at
Stanford," he said, "is the large
number of girls and the scarcity of
fellows." Yes, there ARE a large
number of girls around, aren't
there?


. . . FRANK li. DE LEMOS
Twenty-seven years of service to
the University—that is the record of
Frank B. de Lemos, acting director
of the Museum of Fine Arts and the
Art Gallery, who will retire next
August.
Mr. de Lemos came to Stanford in
1918 when a number of the depart
ments in the Museum were still in a
chaotic condition as a result of the
earthquake of 1906. Rooms such as
the Egyptian Room and the Stan
ford Memorial Room were all re
stored to presentable condition, and
at the same time the Art Gallery
was opened to the public.
Museum Oldest Building
Built in 1891, the Museum is one
of the oldest buildings on the cam
pus. Unlike the school itself, the
Museum remains open twelve
months a year to the public and
students. Mr. de Lemos' job has
been the taking care of all exhibits
and the arranging of current exhib
its in both the art gallery and the
museum.
Asked how he felt after serving so
many years at one job, Mr. de Lemos
replied, "I have enjoyed the work
here through the years, and I be
lieve that I have benefitted from it.
However, I am looking forward to
the change when I retire next Au
gust.
Artist in Bay Area
Before coming to Stanford, Mr, de
Lemos was a commercial artist in
San Francisco and Oakland. He also
taught art at the San Francisco In
stitute of Art during the summer
semesters. Even after coming here,
he went to Chicago during a few of
the summer vacations. There he
taught art, lettering, design, and art
crafts in a private accredited school.
