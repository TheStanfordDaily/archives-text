## 
### JOAN HODGDON LISA EBBERTS 
"I sincerely believe the San Fran
cisco Conference will succeed,"
stated a prominent State Depart
ment official at a San Francisco
Press Club luncheon Sunday. Bas
ing his belief on his faith in the
much-discussed Dumbarton Oaks
proposals, he told how 20 questions
involving these proposals have al
ready been agreed upon in friendly
meetings of delegates that have not
been clashes or debates.
This speech highlighted the lunch
eon at which five prominent radio
commentators told some of their
worldwide experiences reporting the
news. George Moorad, recently re
turned from Moscow; Charles
Hodges, Stanford graduate and now
a New York professor and newsman;
and James Abbe, popular news ana
lyst, all told of restricted press con
ditions in Russia. Bert Silen and
John B. Hughes, war correspondents,
described conditions in villages and
prison camps in the Philippines.
.Russian Press
Mr. Moorad left Moscow two
weeks ago and he told how all for
eign correspondents there are close
ly confined and only allowed to go
on "much conducted" tours of con
quered countries. He visited Hel
sinki recently but was allowed to see
no Finnish newsmen and could
speak only with Communists. So
little news is released in Moscow
that instead of 35 foreign corre
spondents there are now 16.
The Russians are incredibly ig
norant of America, he stated, and
up to the time of his departure only
one article had been printed in
Moscow about the San Francisco
Conference. No American newspa
pers or movies are allowed in Rus
sia.
Photographs Stalin
Mr. Hodges, Mutual Broadcasting
analyst and professor of interna
tional relations at New York Uni
versity, spoke of the responsibility
of American newspapers and radios
to report straight factual news. He
told his and other leading analysts'
objections to the practice of news
analysts having to give their own
commercials.
James Abbe was the last man to
photograph the battleship Maine and

the first foreign correspondent to
photograph Stalin. He described the
closely supervised news policy in
Moscow which he believes will be
the same after the war. He told of
Goebbels' statement to him once that
democracy is a luxury and only the
United States can afford it.
Farm Graduate
Bert Silen, Stanford graduate and
NBC war correspondent, was a pris
oner of the Japanese for 37 months
in the Santo Tomas internment
camp. He described school condi
tions in the camp and their ingeni
ously concealed radio receiver which
brought them uncensored news of
the outside world.

Recently returned from the South
Pacific, John B. Hughes told of
watching the first Filipino school
open after the Japanese occupation.
The villagers had unburied their
hidden textbooks, and as the school
opened they sang "God Bless Amer
ica," which Filipino children be
lieve to be their native song. Mr.
Hughes called the Filipinos enthu
siastic missionaries for democracy
in the world. They are young, en
thusiastic, and sincere.
Also speaking at the luncheon was
Joe Rosenthal, Associated Press
photographer, famous for his picture
of the Marines raising the flag on
Mt. Suribachi on Iwo Jima.
