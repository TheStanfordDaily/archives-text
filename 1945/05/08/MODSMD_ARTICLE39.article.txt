# How To Spend Money Theme of New Movie
## 
### 
By sheer coincidence, the double
bill now showing at the Stanford
Pheater deals with money—millions
of dollars. The feature bill, "It's in
the Bag," is given main heading be
cause it concerns the most money —
$12,000,000 to be exact. The runner
up, "Brewster's Millions," deals with
a mere $8,000000.
Allen-Benny Comedy
"It's in the Bay," with Fred Allen
and Jack Benny, offers the most en
joyment of the two pictures mainly
because of the large number of well
known stars participating and also
because of a slightly more original
plot. After a week of studying (?),
however, anything resembling a joke
goes over with at least a pop, thus
leading this reviewer to rank both
shows as comedies. The Fred Allen
picture begins with an interesting
introduction of the characters by
baggy eyes himself. Honestly,
though, folks, they were entertain
ing pictures.

Dennis O'Keefe and Helen Walker
star in the second feature in which
the former attempts to spend a mil
lion dollars in two months and at the
same time try to keep his future wife
under control. Seeing this picture
brings back memories of "Million
Dollar Baby" in which the actress
gives the money away instead.
Backed up by the humor of Roch
ester, this show completes, more or
less, three hours of smiles, lalTs, and
guffaws. A serious note enters in
the form of a showing of Nazi atroci
ties in German concentration camps.
If you go to this show, be pre
pared for plenty of subtle enter
tainment in both pictures.—Lokey
