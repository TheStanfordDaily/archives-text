# Five Women To Discuss Hall Closing
## Campus Firesides Must End by 11:30 
### 
Subjects discussed at yester
day's meeting of Women's Con
i'crcncc were:
1. Closing hours in women's
houses.
2. Firesides.
A committee of five was appointed
to work out a system for having
women's houses open until 1:30 on
the four remaining Saturday nights
beginning next Saturday night, if
possible. The girls are Gail Irvine,
Pat Whittemore, Lois Griffitts, Lyle
Davis, and Evelyn Reitze.
Only Temporary
Pam Strathairn, president of Con
ference, announced that no definite
proposal could be passed for having
houses open because it would only
be a temporary thing during the
curfew period. "We would not want
to pass anything that would cause
obligations next year," she said.
The committee will try to devise
a system this week whereby indi
vidual houses could phone in if a
majority of students in the house
want the house to close at 1:30 rath
er than 12.
Define Firesides
Marylou McClure, A.S.S.U. vice
president, clarified the definition of
firesides. They arc informal closed
functions and must close at 11:30.
The number attending must not ex
ceed twice the number of people in
the organization. One patron is nec
essary and it may be a resident as
sistant or person connected with the
University.
