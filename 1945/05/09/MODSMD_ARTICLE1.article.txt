# Sah Tells Of School Shifting
## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
The development of transplanted
National University of Amoy was
explained and illustrated by Dr. A.
Pen-Tung Sah, visiting professor of
electrical engineering at Stanford,
who described eight years of prog
ress in ''Building a New Campus in
Wartime China" at the Tuesday
Evening Series last night.
Appointed president of the Na
tional University of Amoy, China,
one day before Sino-Japanese hos
tilities broke out, Dr. Sah organized
a 150-mile retreat inland under
threat of advancing Japanese armies.
Trucks moved students and equip
ment to tiny Changting, a sheltered
valley on the eastern coast of China.
Bombs Interrupted Classes
"No classes were held between 10
and 2," Dr. Sah explained, "because
bombing attacks occurred most fre
quently during that interval." A pa
goda-style temple of Confucius was
the first building of the new campus,
and after tactful maneuvering, a
prison and the commissioner's res
idence were added.
Gradually, the university erected
wooden structures — some without
nails, some with bark roofs —to
house students and classes. Ruined
palaces, temples, and village build
ings were repaired and expanded,
until the campus covered a strip a
mile long and a half-mile wide—
approximately a fifth of the town.
Largest Single Library in China
"The National University now has
about 150.000 books, which is the
largest collection in one spot in pres
ent China," explained Dr. Sah, as
he showed slides of the library, stu
dent dormitories, and classrooms.
All Chinese universities are co-edu
cational, except for one normal
school for girls," the Chinese edu
cator said as he showed the educa
tional activities of women students.
Summing up his experiences in
Chinese education, Dr. Sah looked
to education of the future to relieve
China of her three major burdens—
"ignorance, poverty, and fear."
