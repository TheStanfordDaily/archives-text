# Farm V-E Reaction Shows Sober Realisation of Unfinished Jap War
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Stanford students left Memorial
Church soberly yesterday morning.
One sophomore wiped her eyes sur
reptitiously. "Golly," she cracked
resentfully, "if it's this sad when we
beat the Japs, I hope we can get
Kleenex for the occasion."
It was V-E Day. but it wasn't what
we expected. Students had flip
pantly hoped for the announcement
before every mid-term, and here it
was. War was over in Europe. But
there was no sudden blast of fire
whistles, no noisy holiday celebra
tion.
"It isn't over yet," were the words
we heard everywhere. "We still have
to win in the Pacific."
I -Day
"This is U-Day for us," said Cap
tain John Doonev of the Civil Affairs
Training School. "My friends and I
are training for military government
in the Pacific, and our work I? very
much Unfinished."
"Two French delegates spoke to
my class this morning," said Dr. Wil
liam Hopkins of the Economics De
partment. "They felt the war was
finished, and were surprised by our

quietness. 1 tried to explain to them i
that we still have our own war to j
fight with Japan."
Stanford vs. New York
A New Yorker visiting the cam
pus marveled at our calmness, j
"Back home they are jamming the I
streets." he said. "Our newspapers
are full of victory; they will rem em- â– 
ber Japan tomorrow. But you West
erners don't seem to recognize the
European war. I guess you have al- j
ways considered the Japanese war j
your own."
Marilou Lanning was thinking of i
her cousin in the Seventh Army. I
"We are all praying he is safe," i
she said. Her cousin went over with
the first invasion and has fought
through France. Italy, and Germany.
When last heard from, he was in
southern Germany where the fight- j
ing was ioughest.
Dr. Harold Bacon mentioned some 1
of the letters he has received from 1
former students in Europe. "They 1
all want to come home," he said, i
But Dr. Bacon was thinking how
much work remains in Europe, and
how many of our soldiers will have
to stay there in a temporarv armv of

i occupation.
March to the West
Dr. Dayton Phillips thought of our
i West Coast. "How will we take care
| of six million men who are going to
J Japan?" he wondered. "If Califor
nia is pressed now. what will it be
in six months; where will we house
| them all? We don't yet know all -
! out war, but we may understand it
! better then."
i Marcia Kirkemeier was thinking
! the same thing when she asked, "Do
! you suppose they will station Brit
j ish troops here like we put our men
[ in England?"
Outwardly it was an ordinary day
at Stanford. But war was over in
Europe, and our hopes were a little
more fervent. "The Security Con
ference has to succeed." Some stu
dents looked sleepier than usual;
| they woke up at 6 a.m. to hear
President Truman announce V-E
1 Day. And there were no eleven o -
1 clock classes because that was our
I hour of thanks.
But hashers pedaled to work as
usual, and by 2 p.m. the libraries
1 were full. Stanford was returning
to work.
