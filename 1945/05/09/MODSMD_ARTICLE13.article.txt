# ”And Stanford for Its Men”
## 
### 
Seems to us we heard a song like that once.
Now we should waltz into something like "It
Ain't the Same Old Farm," but this "ratio" busi
ness is worn out by now; besides, there are
some men on campus. Don't laugh. We can
prove it—it says so in the registration figures,
approximately 820 (civilians), all living in happy
little groups up the Row or over in the larger
dorms. 0.K., so you don't believe us; we have
a hard time believing it ourselves, especially
when we look around to see just what men's
living units have accomplished in the last year.
We looked for them last fall. War Board was
going to do great things with stamp sales in
men's halls. They appointed a Men's War
Board Co-ordinator. He couldn't even get
enough representatives together to hand out
the stamps.
We looked for them on the Blood Bank sign
up sheets. There may have been one or maybe
two masculine-sounding names on the appoint
ment list.
Winter guarter we examined the Pow-Wow
program. We saw a skit from one (1) men's
hall.
Come spring, things are looking up at the
Junior Water Carnival, complete with one men's
"float" entry.
And then the Soph Carnival . . . We may
have seen two or three men's living units setting
up booths— not sure.
All of which should be fairly illustrative of
the fact that men's halls are well out of the cam
pus activities picture. Inter-Hall Council, to all
appearances, is a myth; Inter-Fraternity Board
we haven't heard from; and Men's War Board
may as well never have been created.
Under Excom's new area election plan the
sole men's representation in student govern
ment will come from the living group area.
The present system of having men's living
unit representatives meet with the head of
Inter-Hall Council, who carries opinions to Ex
com, has broken down completely. This quar
ter, however, men are still represented on Ex
com through their classes. After the next elec
tions their only representation will come from
the living group area. Time for organization,
decision, action. Where's the 800?— H. D.
