THE INVASION OF ASIA
Japan can be beaten in two ways. The first way is
sure but long, while the second is based on many non

military and unpredicable factors. It might well be
that both will have to be combined.
The first strategy would be to avoid invading the
Home Islands. Japan would be ringed with naval bases,
would be beaten by a land campaign in China, and
would be bludgeoned under by the process of starva
tion and aerial bombardment.
The second involves a direct invasion of Japan prop
er, hoping that the enemy will quit after he loses his
his political centers, instead of simply creating new
ones elsewhere. The fact that the Germans did not try
to fight a Valhalla battle in Norway, despite Nazi fa
naticism, gives the latter course some hope.
On the other hand, Norway, being a poor counti-y,
could not support an army. The Japanese army in
Manchuria, however, was, as early as the 'thirties, cap
able of getting along without any imports whatso
ever.
THE COMBINED PLAN
The ideal combined plan would be, therefore, for an
invasion of Japanese industrial centers in Asia first.
If starvation, including raw-material starvation, is not
enough to force the Japanese to quit, it will certainly
loosen their hold on their islands long enough for an
army to throw them out without too much trouble.
At any rate, either the blockade plan or the com
bined plan would include an invasion of Asia proper.
The form and shape of this movement is not too hard
to discern.
FIRST STEP
Th first step in the program might be to establish
a solid line of bases from Manila to Okinawa. This
includes the invasion of Formosa, which will be ren
dered less difficult by the capture of Okinawa, that
capture cutting Formosa off from supples.
The only tactical approach to Formosa is by the
west side. Cliffs on the eastern shore run down verti
cally to the sea.
In order to attack western Formosa, an invader must
first secure the Pescadores Islands, which might be
taken in the near future. Since the island itself is
very large, it is possible that we can, as on Okinawa,
gain the main beachhead by surprise and surprise
alone, and then shoulder the enemy into the dense pine
forests of the interior. All that we need are the port
facilities, which probably will be turned.
LANDING IN CHINA
The landing in China would best be made either
along the flat strip of western coast in the near area of
Shanghai, which is devoid of the marshes which mar
the rest of the coastline, or on the sides of the Korean
Peninsula. A landing near Shanghai would leave us
a flat road of approach to the north, but an extremely
long and narrow one which might be defended in
depth.
Korea, being a peninsula, would be easily cut off,
but, once we got in, we would have to break out again.
At any rate the promised land is the flat plains be
hind the Manchurian border, and the only army con
centrated enough to deal with us there would be the
crack Manchurian army of 1,000.000 men. Yet how
much fire power this represents, considering the bad
ness of Japanese artillery tactics and our qualitative
superiority of mechanized equipment, is a question.
What we will need is a three to one superiority in
fire power, not in men, and thus our offensive force
might total much less than 1.000,000 men.
A Russian diversion in the Japanese rear woidd help
us out greatly, but we might be able to do well with
out it.
As for the rest of the Japanese army in China, once
the main industrial centers of Manchuria are taken,
it will die on the limb, so to speak.
