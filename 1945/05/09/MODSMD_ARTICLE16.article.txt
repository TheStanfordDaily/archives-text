### PEGGY FITTS 
. . . AND NOW IT'S YESTERDAY
The day of victory in Europe, the day that was
marked down for our side when Germany marched into
Poland on the first of September, 1939, has come and
gone. It looked for a time as though it would never
come, and now it's yesterday.
Some people woke up before daylight to hear the
President and the Prime Minister, and then went on to
their classes, and to the Cellar, where the loudspeaker
was blaring, and one of the morning papers carried the
words in red. white and blue headlines. Then they
crowded into the Chapel, carrying their books, to com
memorate it in common with half the world.
Throughout the day Stanford was a quiet place.
There was none of the wild-eyed celebration that many
of us had once expected. No torn-up paper, no loud
singing, no dancing in the streets. Here on the edge
of the Pacific Ocean, if we could look right across the
gray-green water that rolls out under the big bridges,
we could have seen the other side of V-E Day. Victory
in Europe still meant war in the Pacific, without a let
up of one day or one hour for us to celebrate the way
we wanted to. We went from class to class, and to the
Cellar, and to the Chapel with a feeling of relief that
so much was over and a feeling of sadness that so much
was still to come.
There was another day marked down for our side
when the first Jap bomb fell on Honolulu on the sev
enth of December. 1941. That day may be a long way
off, but we can see it coming; it. too. is a potential yes
terday. That's the day we'll have a right to celebrate,
if at all, with everything we've got; a day for loud
singing and dancing in the streets, if there ever was
one: a day to look all over the world, in any direction,
and see no war anywhere at all. That's the day we're
waiting for.
