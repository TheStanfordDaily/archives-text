### NANCY BANNICK 
"We all feel joy today because the
first chapter in this war has ended,"
said President Donald B. Tresidder
in his special V-E Day address in
the Memorial Church yesterday at
11 a.m.
He told Stanford students how
lucky they were to be living in a
country that was untouched by the
war in comparison to the other great
powers which have taken the brunt
of the European fighting in destruc
tion of their countries as well as in
loss of lives.
"We still have the Japanese to

fight," he said, "in order to finish
Chapter Two, and this will be a
much harder job than the first. I am
looking forward to the time when we
can have a service similar to this
to celebrate the end of the war."
Dr. Tresidder said that forming a
lasting peace was one of the major
issues confronting our counti-y to
day, and that Stanford had become
much more aware of this problem
during the last few weeks
(> I hope that in 20 or 25 years from
now you will not have the worry
and grief of your sons being in a
war."
