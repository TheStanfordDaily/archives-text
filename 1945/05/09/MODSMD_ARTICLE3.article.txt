# Scavenger Hunt To Open Farm Bond Drive Friday
## 
### 
Stanford scavengers will start scavengering this Friday at 2 p.m. when the
7th War Loan Drive begins at Stanford with an all-campus Scavenger
Hunt, announced Jack Siemer and Willie Davies, chairmen of the hunt.
The scavengers will leave the boathouse in groups of ten, after paying
the admission of one 25-cent war stamp a person. Each group will be

responsible for the collection of*
40 not-too-easy-to-find but still-fun
items, which must be turned in by
7 p.m.

The Scavenger Hunt marks the
opening of the 7th War Loan Drive
for which Stanford has a quota of
$50,000, twice as much as last time.
The drive will continue through next
week, and will culminate the night
of the 18th, when there will be an
all-campus auction.
One of the features of the auction
will be the auctioning of professor's
time. Here is the opportunity to ob
tain some Poli. Sci. professor for a
hashing shift.
Hashers will give separate house
auctions during the coming week.

the Scavenger Hunt.
