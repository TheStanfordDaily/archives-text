# Joffre Team To Meet Cal
## 
### 
Debaters Mary Frances Weslcott.
Sylvia Roberts, Vicky Sellens, and
Marshall Small are winners of the
final tryouts for the Joffre team held
last night in the Eductaion Auditor
ium.
Of these four, three will represent
Stanford in the debate with Cal to
be held in the Education Auditorium
on May 23 on some phase of the gen
eral subject, "The Foreign Policy of
France from Locarno to San Fran
cisco."
The subject of last night's finj'
tryout was "Resolved, that the bJI
interests of France in foreign affairs
lie in a swing to the Left.'
As is the custom in the Joffre de
bates, the contestants received the
question an hour before the debate
took place.
Work began on the Joffre ques
tion at the beginning of winter quar
ter when a Joffre squad was formed
to start research on the French
question. Faculty members special
izing in modern European studies
supplied reading lists to assist squad
members in their study of the ques
tion.
This year's debate marks the en
trance into the second half century
of competition for the Joffre Med
aille between teams from Stanford
and California. As the victories are
now even between the two schools,
this year's winner will break the
tie.
