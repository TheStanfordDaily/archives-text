# Trophy Award Awaits Rest Male Songsters
## 
### 
You can't lose, men of Stanford.
A trophy will he awarded to the
men's living group whose musical
presentation is judged best at the
Spring Sing, June 1, and thus far
no men's group has registered in
the competition. A few baritones
and a minimum of harmony ought
to win some enterprising group
the first prize, according to Martha
Austin, Cardinals member in
charge of the Sing.
All entries must be made by
May 18 and registered at the
ASSU office. The Sing will be held
in the Frost Memorial Amphithea
ter.
