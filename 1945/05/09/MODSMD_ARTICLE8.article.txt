### ELLEN MARCUS 
'"The possession, transportation or
use of intoxicating liquors by Stan
ford students in the University
community shall be grounds for ex
pulsion from the University." So
reads the Fundamental Standard.
And so instead of beer and pretzels,
Ram's Head will serve cider and
doughnuts at its annual Spring
Show. They will be for sale for
ten cents in the patio outside of the
Little Theater between all acts; and
it is promised that the cider will be
cold and the doughnuts fresh.
Tickets Selling Fast
The production, which includes
the melodrama "From Rags to
Riches" and 14 olio acts, is scheduled
to open tomorrow night in the Little
Theater at 8:15. There are still a
few tickets left for that performance
and the Saturday matinee, but they
are selling fast, according to Carl
Data, dramatic manager. Students
are advised to obtain these tickets as
soon as possible at the A.S.S.U. of
fice; for if there are any remaining
tomorrow, they will be sold in Palo

Alto. Every seat
in the house is
good; so, there
fore, none of the
tickets are for
reserved seats
and all cost $1.
All of the cos
tumes for both
the play an d the
olios will be au
thentic Gay '90s
outfits or exact
replicas. Joan
Hubbard, who
will present a
stylized waltz of
that period, and

Gini De Long, who will tap out the
number, "The Girl I Met at Sher
ry's," will both wear dresses belong
ing to their grandmothers.

Stereotyped!
The stereotyped costumes of the
stereotyped song and dance men will
be seen on Bob Gettys and Lee Zeig-
