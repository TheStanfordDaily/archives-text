MOTHER
MAGIC PERSON OF ALL AGES -
You may have sweethearts, and many friends,
Yes, even a wife or husband and a mother-in-law, too
And to be sure, Grandmothers, God Bless them,
But in all the world—only one Mother!
She's forgiving, kind, loyal and true —yes,everything
You hope for, wrapped up in one, yet
Rarely find in many persons —let alone one.
When as a baby you kept her up nights
Keepink a vigil through sickness and health
When as a child you were bad in your World
She understood, and if she disciplined, it was with love
And then you grew up—into teens, and
Puppy love started to tear at her heart —
For she knew . . . Mothers always do —
That someone would take you away from her—but never
Completely, not if you were trueKbecause in the person
You marry you will see the things you love, in your Mother.
And npw with a war on —how sad Mother's plight—
She can only stand by and wait—but does she? No! g
No matter where you are or what you are doing, I
She believes in and prays for you—-knows you will do your job
The way she has always done hers —that's life
To a mother —believing—having faith —
* Loving—blindly, perhaps, when you
Sin or hurt her —but always with understanding.
Yes, in war or peace—Mother deserves a medal, too.
For the hours she's waited hopelessly alone
When day after day—week after week—the
Mail man has brought no word of you—
So partly to forget (but mostly to do
What she can to help) she pitches in—
Wraps bandages, tenderly (they may be for
Her child) —donates to the Blood Bank—buys
War Bonds and such—is a Nurse's Aide,
A otor Corps Driver—a War Chest Solicitor -
A USG Worker—and if you're old enough,
Mother joins up, too, as a Nurse—
A WAVE, WAC, Marine or a Spar
Because—Mothers know—only in pence—
A world united for and in PEACE
Can you and she find the happiness
She's given a lifetime to bring to you.
Yes, Mother deserves a medal, too, but the
Award she wants is your love —and this
She knows she must share —and she does so
Willingly—she understands—she knows
That down in your heart, you want to repay
Her for all she has done for you—but
She doesn't expect it, and she knows that
Only by doing for those who follow you
As she has always done for you •
Will your debt to her be repaid—but
As you live your life, there are many ways
You can show her you love her —
Remember her—honor her.
So just to remind you of all these things—
Lest you've forgotten or merely overlooked in
The stress of these times—how much 112
Mother means to you—a special day is marked
For her alone —Mother's Day!
