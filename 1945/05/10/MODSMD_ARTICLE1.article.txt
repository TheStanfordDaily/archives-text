# Polish Problem Unsolved As Molotov Goes

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May J) (UP). â€”Foreign Commissar V. M. Molotov
flew toward Moscow tonight and with him went the last glimmering pos
sibility that Big Three decisions at San Francisco might solve the Polish
problem.
United Nations delegates agreed that Molotov's presence in their
councils had speeded the work of drafting the new World Security Char
ter, but on Poland it was apparent that the Big Three were farther apart
than before the Soviet Foreign Commissar's trip to America.
Molotov's departure was the signal for the leaving also of W. Averill
Harriman and Sir Archibald Clarke Kerr, the American and British
ambassadors to Moscow, who with Molotov comprise the so-called "Mos
sow Commission" established at Yalta to handle the reorganization of
the Polish government.
