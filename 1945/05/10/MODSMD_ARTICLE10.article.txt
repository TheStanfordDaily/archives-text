In one corner of' Toyon's large
lounge will be a bar and tables at
which waiters will serve the cus
tomers. The free refreshments will
feature all kinds of cider, ginger ale,
cake, and pretzels.
Other decoration ideas being

corner spittoons, and reminiscent
signs of the period such as '"Foam is
where the heart is."

Dress for the evening will be
strictly informal. Sport clothes or
suits will be predominant but coup
les coming from other dances should
not feel out of place in any dress.
The dance, which will stay open
after the Spring Show, will carry
on the theme of the Gay Nineties
melodrama, "From Rags to Riches,"
the feature of the show. Toyon is
inviting everyone to make an eve
ning of it by winding up at the

both successful features of the
Toyon social program.
Intermission Entertainment
Entertainment during the inter

ture of the dance. Well-known
campus personalities will sing such
well-known songs as "The Letter
Edged in Black" and "Heaven Will
Protect the Working Goil."
