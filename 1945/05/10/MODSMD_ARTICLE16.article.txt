# Sequoia Hay Ready for Ride
## 
### 
"Come for a romance on a hay
ride Saturday night when the Se
quoia Roughs give their combination
hay-ride-dance with a 'Get out of
your tux into your jeans' theme,"
said George Potter, president.
The boys have a trained team of
show horses all ready to pull the
wagons. The wagons will stop at the
Spring Show when it is over to pick
up people for the ride and dance,
and it is all free.
There will be two hay racks that
will leave Sequoia every 15 minutes
for a half-hour ride. Between rides
students can come back to the house
for dancing and refreshments. An
accordionist will go on each ride.
At 12, the last hay rack will leave
Sequoia at the end of the dance and
tour the campus taking those coup
les home who want one last ride.
"Save admission charges, shoe
leather, and your good clothes, and
come to Sequoia Saturday night,"
Potter said.
