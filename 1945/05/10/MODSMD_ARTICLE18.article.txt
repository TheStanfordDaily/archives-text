# Spring Show Opens 8:15; Bond Drive Starts Friday
## Scavenger Hunt Begins Loan Drive 
### MARION MORROW 
A Scavenger. Hunt beginning sit
the Boathousc tomorrow at 2 p.m.
will open Stanford's bid to fill her
quota in the Seventh War Loan
Drive, announced Jack Siemcr and
Willie Davies, chairmen.
Admission to the hunt will be one
25-cent stamp per person, and the
scavenger - hunters will leave in
groups of ten to roam the campus
searching for the 40 required items
which must be returned by 7 p.m.
Any Bonds Today?
War Board's plans for the week
long drive which ends on Friday,
May 18, include a day-by-day bom
bardment of the accumulated Farm
pocketbooks and wallets in varied
and interesting methods.
Hashers to be announced later
will hold individual house auctions
in their usual co-ed purse-cleaning.
Auction Presents!
On the night of the 18th, a big all
campus auction will be given in the
Nitery. Among the numerous ar
ticles to be auctioned will be a new
invention — professor's time. This
will make it possible for you to sec
Dr. Tresidder hashing, or Dr. Bar
clay washing dishes, or maybe even
Dr. Treat cutting the lawn on Quad.
This latter, however, is pure conjec
ture.
$50,000 Pledged
Stanford has a responsibility to
fulfill in this drive, opening tomor
row — a $50,000 responsibility — the
quota pledged by the Associated
Students of Stanford. In order to
obtain such an amount co-operation
will be needed on the very first day.
Stanford was thankful on V-E
Day, yet few students did not real
ize the necessity for emphasizing the
importance of the Pacific war on
the rest of the nation, not to mention
the world. Stanford feels its attitude
exemplary of ihe Pacific Coast.
Stanford obligates itself in such a
feeling and such a realization. It
obligates itself to lead the nation, as
President Roosevelt would have
said, "to point the way.''
Spanking Out
As a part, as an exemplification,
of the Pacific Coast, Stanford should
at no time during the drive require
editorials or verbal spankings from
a tired Daily or War Board.
This spanking routine had to be
resorted to in the last drive, and the
present drive has twice the former's
quota. Whether or not Stanford can
be said to be a good example of Pa
cific Coast leadership, of realization
and acceptance of responsibility, or
of just plain spirit will be tested
again in ihc coming week.
