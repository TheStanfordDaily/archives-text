members attending .Since the De
partment, has no authority to direct
delegates to attend .such a banquet,
there would be no guarantee that a
certain desired number would at
tend.
An invitation to the delegates,
however, would exercise unofficial
pressure on them to attend, while

Department, a student group, it
was iudged, might find such a
banquet too great an undertaking.
