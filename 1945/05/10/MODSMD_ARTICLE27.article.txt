## THE 						CURTAIN 
### 
V/hen the cast and directors of Ram's Head's
Spring Show are clapped off the stage after the
first and the last nights of "Rags to Riches,"
it will be the last trip on a Stanford stage for
'•ome old-standbys in student drama.
Fitts, Wollman, High, and Morgan have been
Stanford Drama for the students and have in
terpreted the Farm as it has been to us, for our
entertainment.
In this activity-less age for the Farm, the
lore of Gaieties gags has not diminished nor
its vigor and art in interpretation of campus
life.
The general war curtailments of people, ex
perience, and cash, has hit Ram's Head like
other student activities, and for them, the sub
stitute of sheer well meaning callowness does
not so easily replace the requirement for artis
try.
The memorable high-spots they have pro
duced have contributed to the entertainment of
the Farm. We have no doubt that this is all
they ask in the way of a reward; but the facets
of appreciation are likewise diminished these
dc.ys, and for the '45 Spring Show, we would
like to lead the clap off, we hope their biggest.

all Allied military power must be transported
to the Pacific islands, to crush and eradicate
Japanese military power. We can be soberly
thankful that this terrible and bloody war has
finally ended.
After President Truman spoke, a rebroadcast
of Prime Minister Churchill's victory procla
mation was presented, in which he thanked
God for the overwhelming Allied victory over
Nazi tyranny. He said that the war would for
mally end at midnight yesterday, British time,
and any Nazis who made further resistance
after that deadline would be treated as outlaws
if captured.
From Paris a war correspondent described
the surrender scene, where the great Allied
military leaders gathered around a rough
wooden table to end with a simple, dignified
ceremony five years and eight months of hor
rible bloodshed.
The German military commander with trem
bling hands and sullen features signed the his
toric surrender document, and then pleaded
that the German people, who have suffered the
most in this war, might be mercifully treated.
Only a few correspondents including a single
woman correspondent were permitted to wit
ness this historic event.
Then the various Allied generals made com
ments, hailing the victory over Nazism and em
phasising the next phase of the war against
Japan. From the San Francisco docks sailors
and merchant marines broadcast their feelings,
that the war was not over for them, as the Japa
nese are still doing a bit of fighting.
