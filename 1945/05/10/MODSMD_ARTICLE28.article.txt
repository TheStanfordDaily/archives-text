Eight Choices, Please
Technicality after technicality rear extremely
ugly heads to plague the women's Housing
Committee and set its plans temporarily up
side-down. The newest one isn't too ugly or
unsolvable, for it concerns the number of
choices Lower Division women will mark down
on their residence choice cards next week.
At present the number of these preferences
is five, and instructions to list five are printed
on the cards; however, to insure the smooth
progress of the residence drawing we advocate
boosting the number of choices to eight.
Although, five was a large enough number for
the lot preference system in other years when
the turnover of Lower Division residence
changes was smaller, to accomodate this year's
group the number should be raised to seven
or eight.
Five won't satisfy certain situations. For
example, it a girl has listed live Lagunita
casas as her preferences, and the number she
draws is high, Lagunita may be filled before
her card can be considered. This way there
would be no indication of where she would
like to live from the many other houses on
campus; if she had eight choices the process
could continue without interruption and she
would be placed, if possible, in the next resi
dence she had indicated.
While writing down eight choices would not
inconvenience the Lower Division women draw
ing, it would take care of possibilities such as
this, eliminate any necessity for a small group
re drawing and re-listing, and prevent any in
terruption of the room allotment process to have
each individual girl who had not received any
of her five choices signify her next-best pref
erences.â€”N.S.
