### PEGGY FITTS 
Everybody going to the Spring Show tonight?
Going to see the pretty girls behind the
grease-paint, and the handlebar mustaches be
hind the pretty girls, and all kinds of rarities
I won't even attempt to describe behind the
handlebar mustaches-
Going to step right up for a slice of the gilded
past (goes good with coffee and doughnuts)
â€”gaiety under the gaslight, complete with lav
ish sets, lavish costumes, and one loud (but
lavish) piano?
Going to climb into your jeans and the spirit
of the evening for purposes of giving out with
the kiddies' matinee variety of applause, cheers
for the hero, hisses for the villain, and an elo
guent grunt for the beavers on the stage crew?
Going to have some of the guarter's best fun
with some of the Farm's best people (every
body else is in the show), and walk away hum
ming the tunes and muttering the speeches
and maybe thinking you've just bought your
self a very fat dollar's worth of entertainment
(?).
Going to the Spring Show tonight? Or Fri
day night? Or Saturday, almost any time?
See ya.
