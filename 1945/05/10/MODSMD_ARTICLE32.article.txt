FEMININE INTUITION
It has bccome one of the rarely examined supersti
tions of their sex that women are innately blessed with
a quality denied the male, namely, intuition. When
pressed for a reason for their thoughts or actions they
are often inclined to offer this poor crumb which, if
accompanied with an inscrutable smile, is designed to
put an end to argument. Woe to the man who bows:
the knee to such a dogma; he has enslaved himself to a
foe of reason and must henceforth cast aside his think
ing mind in his relations with women.
The flow of things perceived by the senses at first
presents complete chaos to the iniml that tries to find
any order in it. Hut as (he practice of selection he
comes stronger, the mind is able to relate its sensory
perceptions to certain theoretic concepts, by means of
which it is able to explain external phenomena. These
concepts are useful as they can be built up by the
mind ultimately to predict events not yet perceived.
This explanation is necessary to introduce intuition.
When the abstracting process has not been fully carried
out, the mind is yet capable of making jumps; it has
a feeling for the answer but cannot express it on the
verbal level. This is true intuition. It must be based
on ;i quantity of observations which appear to lead to
wards a certain, still ungrasped, general principle. It is
clear that intuition is anterior and inferior to thinking,
but in some cases may be the best that the situation
will permit.
Intuition has its place in science. It is the "inspired
guess" (hat frequently has given the right answer
when there was still no apparent rational l>asis on
which to start.
The self-styled feminine "intuition" is immediately
suspect when one recalls hew lew women are genuinely
interested in abstractions and generalizations, for which
a faculty must be highly developed before intuition is
possible.
And when one examines where feminine "intuition"
is most oiten employed, it is found to be almost wholly
in the realm of personal relations between the sexes.
It was well known to the Psalmist that the way of a
man with a maid is far beyond understanding; it is
beyond even an intuitive guess.
What is it then that women substitute for true in
tuition in this intricate field of study? They have
developed through the centuries a slave's quickness
in the apprehension of the moods of a master. Before
a man is himself aware of the trend of his emotional
state, it has been observed by the well-trained eye of
his servile mate. She is thus able to forestall or to
minister with a promptness (hat she not unwillingly
ascribes to her superior "intuition."
It would be churlish to deny the fair sex their il
lusions on (his score were it not that they fancy, and
sometimes persuade others, that if "intuition" works in
one matter it must l>e workable in all. Let men beware,
therefore, of judging anything important, such as the
state of (he nation, the characters of their friends or
the merits of this column, on any opinions (hey may
hear from women of (heir acquaintance.
