# Two French Leaders Tell of War Havoc
## 
### 
"France has suffered destruction
totaling 3000 billion francs, counting
material damages only," declared
M. Rene Hofherr, member of the
French Council of State, Tuesday.
Mr. Hofherr and M. Jean Chatenet,
First Assistant Minister of Labor,
both members of the French delega
tion to the United Nations Confer- .
ence, talked to Stanford students
about the economic and social situ
ation of iheir country.
M. Hofherr pointed out that the
destruction far exceeds that of
World War I. "At present," he said,
"we have only 10 per cent of our
locomotives, one-third of our cars, a
quarter of the normal port facilities,
and a third of the pre-war navy.
The steel and hydroelectric indus
tries located in the north are almost
completely destroyed."
This condition is aggravated by
the long - range problems of
French economy, which were al
ready critical before the war,
those of a declining foreign trade,
lack of raw materials—out of 48
essential materials France is self
supporting in only eight—and a
birthrate that has been decreasing
tor a century.
"To solve our problems we must
sacrifice the production of consum
ers' goods and use all our assets for
rebuilding the country," asserted M.
Hofherr. "After the last war we
rebuilt France as she had been be
lore. We shall not repeat thai er
ror."
The program of reorganization,
which is slowly being put into effect,
intends to divide the economic life
of the country into three parts:
(1) A free section containing the
!ireat mass of small entre
preneurs who will have the
same economic freedom as
before;
(2) A controlled section, consist
ing of enterprises with over
a hundred employees, which
will he operated primarily
by labor-management com
mittees; and
(.'») A nationalized section to in
clude nationalization of nat
ural resources and of credit.
The second main part of the pro
gram proposes to deal with the de
clining population. The seriousness
of the situation can Ik; seen by the
fact that while in 1915 the French
constituted almost one-sixth of Eu
rope's population they are now only
a twentieth part of it. Proposed
measures include incentives for in
creasing the birth rate, better and
longer schooling and encouragement
of immigration when necessary.
Concerning this last it should be
noted that, as M. Hofherr pointed
out, in France naturalization is not
a right but a favor.
Mr. Chatenet emphasized labor
problems. The standard of living is
exceedingly low at present. The
government: is trying to control
wages and prices, but it is difficult
to combat the black market and to
overcome the inequality of wages
caused by the German occupation,
when the Nazis froze incomes but
paid their own workers far in ex
cess of the limit. "We have now a
basic rate of 20 francs (40 cents) an
hour for unskilled workers," said
M. Chatenet, "and we hope to es
tablish a common basis for the
whole country and all trades."
The manpower situation has
changed from a million unem
ployed last December to an acute
shortage in many localities. This

is being relieved by sending
workers to shortage areas and by
improving the efficiency of labor
through better training. To aid in
the reconstruction, France will re
quire two million German work
ers.
Social reforms will fall into two
parts. One is the formation of labor
management committees which will
have a large measure of control in
enterprises with over a hundred
employees. The committee will con
tain the president of the business
and representatives from the differ
ent working groups. The second
part will center around the consoli
dation of the complex social secu
rity laws now existing into a uni
iorm code.
"It will require hard work," the
speaker concluded, "but we have
learned much and shall rebuild
the country."
