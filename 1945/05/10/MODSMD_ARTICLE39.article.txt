# Future Peace to Depend On CATS, Says Anderson

### KEN SCHUG 
"Future peace in the Pacific will
depend on how well the CATS mili
tary governors handle their jobs in
Japan," said Dr. Ronald S. Ander
son in a speech to the Wesley Club
Sunday afternoon. Dr. Anderson,
who is a lecturer in the Civil Affairs
Training School, spoke to the group
on plans for control of occupied en
emy countries which have been es
tablished by American military men.
Dr. Anderson explained that the
CATS program operates only half
a dozen schools in the country, and
that its members are highly selected
men, who have had successful ca
reers in all fields before entering
the program. Among ihe trainees,
he said, are firemen, policemen, col
lege teachers and others who have
been accepted from the rest of the
Army for this special work.
The program, which began about
15 months ago, said the speaker, first
trained officers for military gover
nors in Germany. He added that the
men who trained at Stanford spe
cialized in learning all they could
about Aachen, often in great detail,
and that the group arrived in Ger
many just in time to take over the
control of that city, which they now
govern.
CATS Training for Jap Service
For the past ten months, said Dr.
Anderson, the CATS officers have
been trained for the administration
of the military government of Japan,
a much harder ,iob than in the case
of Germany, because the Oriental
background is completely different
from our own, at times almost im
possible to comprehend.
The military government of Ja
pan, said the speaker, will be very
difficult and decisive both because

i Japan has never been defeated or
invaded in 900 years and because of
"feudal mentality" existing in that
country. He further pointed out that
according to present indications,
"the entire urban area of Japan will
probably be leveled," creating tre
mendous economic problems which
will devolve upon the military gov
ernment officers.
Dr. -Anderson stated that defeat
would destroy the whole reason for
existence of the Japanese people,
encouraging, perhaps, a further re
treat into feudal ideas and Shinto
ism (emperor - worship). He also
said that the people of Japan have
been so thoroughly imbued with
patriotism and loyalty that there is
no underground movement in the
country, and no opposition to the
government outside of concentra
tion camps.
First Must Rehabilitate Japs
The first job of the military gov
ernment officers, who accompany
the invasion of any of the islands
controlled by Japan, said the speak
er, will be to get the people back to
their homes and jobs, prevent sabo
tage, and get supplies rolling.
The long range job, according to
Dr. Anderson, will be to set up a
permanent government which will
permit and encourage liberal Japa
nese to come in and take over con
trol. He expressed the hope that
much of the reorganization of the
Japanese government would be
aided by other members of the
United Nations, to prevent Japanese
antagonism to the United States in
the role of a "victor." The removal
of the Emperor, he added, should be
done by the Japanese themselves,
not by us or the United Nations.
Japan Is Government by Men
The speaker explained that Japan
is a government by men, not laws,
and that consequently, when con
trols are removed, the people often
go haywire ,which may explain their
actions at Nanking and Bataan. He
insisted that we must learn to
understand the Japanese because,
whether we like it or not, there will
still be 70,000,000 of them living not
so far from us, measured in flying
time.
Dr. Anderson spent six years
teaching at a junior college in Japan
and told several incidents to illus
trate the difficulty we have in un
derstanding their behavior. In clos
ing, he emphasized again that "The
reform in Japan should come up
from the bottom and .not be imposed
from without."
