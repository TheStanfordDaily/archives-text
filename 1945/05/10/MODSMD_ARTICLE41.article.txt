For a while it looked as though
Stanford was going to have sports
but was not going to have any more
sports coverage on the Daily. Even
we were wondering about that, but
now everything is all right again (as
if it were ever all right) and the
sports page is once again returning
to print. During that lull, much has
taken place, much that wasn't re
corded. Probably the biggest news
was the resignation of Lt. Jim Law
son, who was head football coach
at Stanford before entering the
service. This leaves Stanford with
out a coach, although Marchie
Schwartz is still within wiring dis
tance.
Lawson, who for years was at
Staniord assisting I'op Warner,
Tiny Thornhill, and Clark
Shaughnessy, was and is one of
Stanford's favorite sons. When he
was appointed head football coach,
the entire alumni, as well as the
students, were very happy. But
before Lawson could take on his
new coaching chores, the Navy
asked for him. Lawson went on
to St. Mary's Pre-Flight where he
acted as an assistant coach. The
record he compiled there was very
enviable.
He now plans to assist Buck Shaw
in the new Ail-American Profes
sional Football League. This team
will have its home base in San
Francisco and should be tops. Plans
call for Lawson to coach the ends
and backs, a job that he is well fit
ted for. As A 1 Masters said, "We
wish him the best of luck."
The effects of this resignation,
however, do not stop there. First of
all, it means that Stanford will defi
nitely have to start looking for a
coach before it gets too late. As we
said before, Mai'chie Schwartz is
still eligible, but he seems very con
tented with his job in some big Mid-
Western corporation. The prospects
for football are very high, though,
and this added incentive might be
just enough to bring Marchie back.
The other part of the story con
cerns the Bears over Berkeley way.
They were quite happy when Buck
Shaw said that he would coach
them; they probably figured that
they could make him stay. But now
it is almost definite that Shaw meant
what he said; he is going right ahead
making plans for professional foot
bal. This means that Cal will also
have to start looking for a new coach
before long.
And if the colleges don't wake
up, they might get into serious
trouble. A good number of the
top collegiate coaches have al
ready joined the professional
ranks and have taken their as
sistants with them. How far this
sudden trend will go. no one
knows. Only one thing is cer
tain: the trend toward profes
sional football is here.

all, it means that Stanford will defi
nitely have to start looking for a
coach before it gets too late. As we
said before, Mai'chie Schwartz is
still eligible, but he seems very con
tented with his job in some big Mid-
Western corporation. The prospects
for football are very high, though,
and this added incentive might be
just enough to bring Marchie back.
The other part of the story con
cerns the Bears over Berkeley way.
They were quite happy when Buck
Shaw said that he would coach
them; they probably figured that
they could make him stay. But now
it is almost definite that Shaw meant
what he said; he is going right ahead
making plans for professional foot
bal. This means that Cal will also
have to start looking for a new coach
before long.
And if the colleges don't wake
up, they might get into serious
trouble. A good number of the
top collegiate coaches have al
ready joined the professional
ranks and have taken their as
sistants with them. How far this
sudden trend will go. no one
knows. Only one thing is cer
tain: the trend toward profes
sional football is here.

For a while it looked as though
Stanford was going to have sports
but was not going to have any more
sports coverage on the Daily. Even
we were wondering about that, but
now everything is all right again (as
if it were ever all right) and the
sports page is once again returning
to print. During that lull, much has
taken place, much that wasn't re
corded. Probably the biggest news
was the resignation of Lt. Jim Law
son, who was head football coach
at Stanford before entering the
service. This leaves Stanford with
out a coach, although Marchie
Schwartz is still within wiring dis
tance.
Lawson, who for years was at
Staniord assisting I'op Warner,
Tiny Thornhill, and Clark
Shaughnessy, was and is one of
Stanford's favorite sons. When he
was appointed head football coach,
the entire alumni, as well as the
students, were very happy. But
before Lawson could take on his
new coaching chores, the Navy
asked for him. Lawson went on
to St. Mary's Pre-Flight where he
acted as an assistant coach. The
record he compiled there was very
enviable.
He now plans to assist Buck Shaw
in the new Ail-American Profes
sional Football League. This team
will have its home base in San
Francisco and should be tops. Plans
call for Lawson to coach the ends
and backs, a job that he is well fit
ted for. As A 1 Masters said, "We
wish him the best of luck."
The effects of this resignation,
however, do not stop there. First of
all, it means that Stanford will defi
nitely have to start looking for a
coach before it gets too late. As we
said before, Mai'chie Schwartz is
still eligible, but he seems very con
tented with his job in some big Mid-
