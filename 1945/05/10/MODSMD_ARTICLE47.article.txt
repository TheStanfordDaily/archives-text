# Lt. Chuck Taylor Back from War
## 
### 
Lt. (j-g.) Chuck Taylor, All-
American Stanford guard on the
1940 and 1941 teams, has returned to
the Coast after a year in the Euro
pean theater of war. Taylor is an
officer aboard an L.C.T. and was a
part oi the D-Day invasion.
On that day, Taylor delivered
tajiks to the Normandy beachhead.
While at Stanford, Chuck Taylor
enjoyed the reputation of a second
Harry Smith; he was one of the
greatest running guards in football.
His red hair seemed to flame with
his spectacular play and made him
one of the most feared on the most
feared team on the Coast. Probably
his greatest thrill was when he stole
the ball from U.E.C.'s Mickey Mc-
Cardle (he took the ball out of Mc-
Cardle's hands) and turned the tide
in "avor of Stanford.
