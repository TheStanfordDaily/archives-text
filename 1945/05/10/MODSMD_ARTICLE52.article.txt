# Dr. Eichelberger Explains Dumbarton Oaks at Forum
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
The dilemma of Dumbarton Oaks,
said Dr. Clark Eichelberger at the
Palo Alto Forum Monday evening,
was to harmonize the demands of
people everywhere for a democratic
world organization with a power sit
uation which is unique in modern
history. Dr. Eichelberger spoke at
the forum as the fourth in a series
of programs on the San Francisco
Conference sponsored by the Palo
Alto League of Women Voters and
the Palo Alto Ministerial Union.
The power situation, he explained.

is that five nations—Russia, United
States, Great Britain, China, and
France—will have a combined mili
tary force greater than all the rest
of the world put together. The
speaker emphasized that Dumbarton
Oaks did not create but merely in
herited this power situation, and
tried to help the big powers to use
their strength for the good of the
entire world community.
In beginning his talk, Dr. Eichel
berger stated that the San Francisco
Charter will be amazingly like the
Dumbarton Oaks agreement, al
though public opinion has caused
the great powers to accept certain
minor amendments, and the small
nations may succeed in making oth
er small changes.
Functions of a Community
Dr. Eichelberger introduced the
subject of Dumbarton Oaks by out
lining the three major functions of
any community, applicable to the
world community. These were: (1)
a guarantee of political freedom to
its members, or security; (2) access
to the courts for a fair hearing or
justice; (3) a chance to earn a liv
ing and improve one's conditions or
welfare. In presenting this, the
speaker repeated President Roose
velt's statement from the Atlantic
Charter in hoping that "all the men
in all the lands might live out their
live:; in freedom from fear and
want."
The United Nations Assembly,
said Dr. Eichelberger, is the first
body of the organization, much as
the League of Nations Assembly
was its primary governing group.
Each member nation will have one
vote in this assembly, irrespective
of size, so that outstanding individ
uals may have an influence far in
excess of his country's power or re
sources, explained the speaker.
He further stated that the assem
bly will control the expenditures of
the organization, elect all non-per
manent members of the Councils to
be established, and deal with any
security issues which are not before
the Security Council.
Security Council
Five of the 11 seats of the Security
Council, said the speaker, will be
permanently occupied by delegates
from the five major powers, the oth
er six positions being filled in ro
tation by representatives from the
other nations. Dr. Eichelberger was
sorry that a distinction had to be
made between small and great pow
ers, saying that he thought the large
powers would always be represented

even if the General Assembly elect
ed all members, but pointed out that
the United States Senate would not
even consider ratification of an
agreement which did not yive this
country a permanent seat on the
Council.
Veto Power of Hive Five
All permanent members must
concur in any decision involving
security issues, explained Dr. Ei
chelberger, this provision commonly
being known as the veto power of
the Big Five. He also said that the
small nations will undoubtedly
make an attempt to change voting
procedure so that only three of the
permanent powers must be included
in the majority decisions of the Se
curity Council.
The speaker was optimistic over
the prospects of the Security Coun
cil for several reasons, mainly be
cause it will be in continuous ses
sion; it will be able to act before
war breaks out, and it will have at
its disposal military contingents
from each member nation, includ
ing contingents of an International
| Air Force.
Social Council
The Social and Economic Coun
cil, continued the speaker, will have
18 members with no distinction be
tween large and small, and will
serve the Assembly in matters of
social, cultural, and economic na
ture. He explained that this Council
will be concerned with the problems
of a peaceful community, including
control of air traffic, stabilization of
currency, regulation of trade, nu
trition projects for that third of the
human race which never get a full
stomach—in short, with all problems
in the field of daily living. It will
increase in importance with time,
predicted Dr. Eichelberger.
After stressing the need for an
interim organization to function be
tween the close of the present Con
ference and the establishment of the
permanent organization, Dr. Eichel
berger emphasized the need for
American participation in the
j United Nations organization. He
I stated that the rest of the world is
I too exhausted to try to make a go
! of the United Nations, organization
without the help of the United
States, concluding with "You and I
must see to it that the assurance of
United States participation is given."
State Department Consultant
Dr. Eichelberger is at the San
Francisco Conference as a consult
ant of the State Department. He is
the president of the American As
sociation for the United Nations,
! formerly known as the League of
Nations Association, which is de
voted to obtaining the entrance and
support of the United States of the
United Nations organization.

speaker emphasized that Dumbarton
Oaks did not create but merely in
herited this power situation, and
tried to help the big powers to use
their strength for the good of the
entire world community.
In beginning his talk, Dr. Eichel
berger stated that the San Francisco
Charter will be amazingly like the
Dumbarton Oaks agreement, al
though public opinion has caused
the great powers to accept certain
minor amendments, and the small
nations may succeed in making oth
er small changes.
Functions of a Community
Dr. Eichelberger introduced the
subject of Dumbarton Oaks by out
lining the three major functions of
any community, applicable to the
world community. These were: (1)
a guarantee of political freedom to
its members, or security; (2) access
to the courts for a fair hearing or
justice; (3) a chance to earn a liv
ing and improve one's conditions or
welfare. In presenting this, the
speaker repeated President Roose
velt's statement from the Atlantic
Charter in hoping that "all the men
in all the lands might live out their
live:; in freedom from fear and
want."
The United Nations Assembly,
said Dr. Eichelberger, is the first
body of the organization, much as
the League of Nations Assembly
was its primary governing group.
Each member nation will have one
vote in this assembly, irrespective
of size, so that outstanding individ
uals may have an influence far in
excess of his country's power or re
sources, explained the speaker.
He further stated that the assem
bly will control the expenditures of
the organization, elect all non-per
manent members of the Councils to
be established, and deal with any
security issues which are not before
the Security Council.
Security Council
Five of the 11 seats of the Security
Council, said the speaker, will be
permanently occupied by delegates
from the five major powers, the oth
er six positions being filled in ro
tation by representatives from the
other nations. Dr. Eichelberger was
sorry that a distinction had to be
made between small and great pow
ers, saying that he thought the large
powers would always be represented

even if the General Assembly elect
ed all members, but pointed out that
the United States Senate would not
even consider ratification of an
agreement which did not yive this
country a permanent seat on the
Council.
Veto Power of Hive Five
All permanent members must
concur in any decision involving
security issues, explained Dr. Ei
chelberger, this provision commonly
being known as the veto power of
the Big Five. He also said that the
small nations will undoubtedly
make an attempt to change voting
procedure so that only three of the
permanent powers must be included
in the majority decisions of the Se
curity Council.
The speaker was optimistic over
the prospects of the Security Coun
cil for several reasons, mainly be
cause it will be in continuous ses
sion; it will be able to act before
war breaks out, and it will have at
its disposal military contingents
from each member nation, includ
ing contingents of an International
| Air Force.
Social Council
The Social and Economic Coun
cil, continued the speaker, will have
18 members with no distinction be
tween large and small, and will
serve the Assembly in matters of
social, cultural, and economic na
ture. He explained that this Council
will be concerned with the problems
of a peaceful community, including
control of air traffic, stabilization of
currency, regulation of trade, nu
trition projects for that third of the
human race which never get a full
stomach—in short, with all problems
in the field of daily living. It will
increase in importance with time,
predicted Dr. Eichelberger.
After stressing the need for an
interim organization to function be
tween the close of the present Con
ference and the establishment of the
permanent organization, Dr. Eichel
berger emphasized the need for
American participation in the
j United Nations organization. He
I stated that the rest of the world is
I too exhausted to try to make a go
! of the United Nations, organization
without the help of the United
States, concluding with "You and I
must see to it that the assurance of
United States participation is given."
State Department Consultant
Dr. Eichelberger is at the San
Francisco Conference as a consult
ant of the State Department. He is
the president of the American As
sociation for the United Nations,
! formerly known as the League of
Nations Association, which is de
voted to obtaining the entrance and
support of the United States of the
United Nations organization.
The dilemma of Dumbarton Oaks,
said Dr. Clark Eichelberger at the
Palo Alto Forum Monday evening,
was to harmonize the demands of
people everywhere for a democratic
world organization with a power sit
uation which is unique in modern
history. Dr. Eichelberger spoke at
the forum as the fourth in a series
of programs on the San Francisco
Conference sponsored by the Palo
Alto League of Women Voters and
the Palo Alto Ministerial Union.
The power situation, he explained.

is that five nations—Russia, United
States, Great Britain, China, and
France—will have a combined mili
tary force greater than all the rest
of the world put together. The
speaker emphasized that Dumbarton
Oaks did not create but merely in

a guarantee of political freedom to
its members, or security; (2) access
to the courts for a fair hearing or
justice; (3) a chance to earn a liv
ing and improve one's conditions or
welfare. In presenting this, the
speaker repeated President Roose
velt's statement from the Atlantic
Charter in hoping that "all the men
in all the lands might live out their
live:; in freedom from fear and
want."
The United Nations Assembly,
said Dr. Eichelberger, is the first
body of the organization, much as
the League of Nations Assembly
was its primary governing group.
Each member nation will have one
vote in this assembly, irrespective
of size, so that outstanding individ
uals may have an influence far in
excess of his country's power or re
sources, explained the speaker.
He further stated that the assem
bly will control the expenditures of
the organization, elect all non-per
manent members of the Councils to
be established, and deal with any
security issues which are not before
the Security Council.
Security Council
Five of the 11 seats of the Security
Council, said the speaker, will be
permanently occupied by delegates
from the five major powers, the oth
er six positions being filled in ro
tation by representatives from the
other nations. Dr. Eichelberger was
sorry that a distinction had to be
made between small and great pow
ers, saying that he thought the large
powers would always be represented

even if the General Assembly elect
ed all members, but pointed out that
the United States Senate would not
even consider ratification of an
agreement which did not yive this
country a permanent seat on the
Council.
Veto Power of Hive Five
All permanent members must
concur in any decision involving
security issues, explained Dr. Ei
chelberger, this provision commonly
being known as the veto power of
the Big Five. He also said that the
small nations will undoubtedly
make an attempt to change voting
procedure so that only three of the
permanent powers must be included
in the majority decisions of the Se
curity Council.
The speaker was optimistic over
the prospects of the Security Coun
cil for several reasons, mainly be
cause it will be in continuous ses
sion; it will be able to act before
war breaks out, and it will have at
its disposal military contingents
from each member nation, includ
ing contingents of an International
| Air Force.
Social Council
The Social and Economic Coun
cil, continued the speaker, will have
18 members with no distinction be
tween large and small, and will
serve the Assembly in matters of
social, cultural, and economic na
ture. He explained that this Council
will be concerned with the problems
of a peaceful community, including
control of air traffic, stabilization of
currency, regulation of trade, nu
trition projects for that third of the
human race which never get a full
stomach—in short, with all problems
in the field of daily living. It will
increase in importance with time,
predicted Dr. Eichelberger.
After stressing the need for an
interim organization to function be
tween the close of the present Con
ference and the establishment of the
permanent organization, Dr. Eichel
berger emphasized the need for
American participation in the
j United Nations organization. He
I stated that the rest of the world is
I too exhausted to try to make a go
! of the United Nations, organization
without the help of the United
States, concluding with "You and I
must see to it that the assurance of
United States participation is given."
State Department Consultant
Dr. Eichelberger is at the San
Francisco Conference as a consult
ant of the State Department. He is
the president of the American As
sociation for the United Nations,
! formerly known as the League of
Nations Association, which is de
voted to obtaining the entrance and
support of the United States of the
United Nations organization.
The dilemma of Dumbarton Oaks,
said Dr. Clark Eichelberger at the
Palo Alto Forum Monday evening,
was to harmonize the demands of
people everywhere for a democratic
world organization with a power sit
uation which is unique in modern
history. Dr. Eichelberger spoke at
the forum as the fourth in a series
of programs on the San Francisco
Conference sponsored by the Palo
Alto League of Women Voters and
the Palo Alto Ministerial Union.
The power situation, he explained.

is that five nations—Russia, United
States, Great Britain, China, and
France—will have a combined mili
tary force greater than all the rest
of the world put together. The
speaker emphasized that Dumbarton
Oaks did not create but merely in
herited this power situation, and
tried to help the big powers to use
their strength for the good of the
entire world community.
In beginning his talk, Dr. Eichel
berger stated that the San Francisco
Charter will be amazingly like the
Dumbarton Oaks agreement, al
though public opinion has caused
the great powers to accept certain
minor amendments, and the small
nations may succeed in making oth
er small changes.
Functions of a Community
Dr. Eichelberger introduced the
subject of Dumbarton Oaks by out
lining the three major functions of
any community, applicable to the
world community. These were: (1)
a guarantee of political freedom to
its members, or security; (2) access
to the courts for a fair hearing or
justice; (3) a chance to earn a liv
