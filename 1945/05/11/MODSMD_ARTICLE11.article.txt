### NANCY TILDEN 
Cheering for the hero, hissing at
the villain, answering asides, roll
ing in the aisles and gesturing vio
lently (the thinu is catching, damn
it) the first-night audience at this
year's all - time, all - time Spring
Show, "From Hags to Riches," was
not quite sure whether it h.id been
part of the show or not.
Of (he fourteen "Every Act a
(iein" olio acts, (lie gem of gems,
the only "we will not stop till we
get an encore" act of the evening
turned out to he the barroom
quartet of Boh (iettys, Bruce
Stewart. Denny Foxe, and .lack
Taylor with their straight-face
renditions of "Li'l Liza Jane."
' .Moonlight on the Wabash." and
"Wait lill the Sun Shines, Nelly."
In particular Denny Foxe of the
quizzical up-turned eyebrows and
baggy yellow suit stole the heart
of the audience, convulsing them
again and again with his batting
eye-lashes and reducing them al
together when he gave it tip at
tlie end and actually smiled.
Of the real ole mellerdrammer it
self it is impossible to say who was
any better than anyone else. The
show was stolen so often that this

reviewer quite lost track of who had
it last. But the biggest hand of the
evening must, cannot help itself but
go to Corky Wollman for a job of
directing that kept the audience in
there pitching from first to last.

Johnny 11iuI> as Albert Cooper,
i Father, under a brand of shame
; (it says here in my program),
turned in his most devastating
• caricatures of the year as both
drunk and plumber. Newton Ar
| nold, as Ned Nimble, loved and
| played, with outstanding assist
ance from his yeller plaid pants,
the noble, clean-cut, hcart-of
golcl newsboy of all time.
At mention of yellow plaid pants
| I must take time out to mention the
I costuming, which was enchanting
| throughout. Dangling earrings,
| swishing talTcta, a hat with a black
ostrich plume that stood straight
up—well, it would be hard to beat.
A hand to Pat Jones, costumes.
To return. Stewart Harrison as
the moustache-twirling, dastardly
villain Prince Charlie slunk about
the stage in a manner suggesting
he was somehow hung from the
ceiling by his hips, made wicked
asides, assaulted our heroine, with
the help of a fiendish Jap in the
person of Willie Davies. and was
generally an entirely satisfactory
villain.
And hi.s partner, Flora Bradley.
