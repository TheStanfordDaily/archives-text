# Special Church Service Is Planned for Sunday
## 
### 
President Truman has set aside
next Sunday. .May 111. as a Nation
al Day of 1 hanksgiving and Pray
er. It is right that we at Stanford
should cooperate in this national
undertaking. We can do this in
many ways. Some will do it in
the churches to which they be
long; some will do it in the pri
vacy of their own rooms; some
will do it in small groups. To all
who wish to share in the Univer
sity service, planned to meet the
President's request, a sincere wel
come is extended.
The service is at 11 and will, we
hope, continue the mood in which
so many shared on Tuesday.
