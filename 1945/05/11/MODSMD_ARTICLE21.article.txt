# Drive Ends On May 18
## 
### MARION MORROW 
War Board has planned some su
per-colossal bond - selling methods
for the week-long drive ending Fri
day, May 18.
Taking a note from the success of
the last drive's hasher auctions, Wat-
Board will again hold individual
' house auctions beginning next week.
This time the girls in the living
[ groups will handle the actual sell
ing of the bonds so that all the
hashers will do is organize some sort
of campaign in the separate living
groups to encourage sales.
Prizes of cigarettes and candy will
be awarded to the winning hasher
crew, competing on a percentage
basis according to the amount sold
per girl.
j Suggestions for the auction in
i elude an auction of articles of cloth
ing, furniture, dolls, etc., given by
the girls, an auction of girls' time for
cleaning rooms, a hasher show for
which bonds are charged as admis
j sion and a dinner during which girls
; have to buy a bond or fill a stamp
book.
House presidents will co-opera lr\
i and see that all plans arc turned in
to Bill Snow by Friday, May 11.
Next Friday night there will be
i a big all-campus auction in the Nit
cry. At this time students will have
Jan opportunity to auction profes
sors' time—this may give the Farm
! a view of Dr. Tresidder hashing, or
i some biology professor dissecting
j the lawn on Quad, or Dr. Buck
| discussing the foreign policy while
! washing dishes.
Between now and the all-campus
auction, however, the every - day
bond sales will have to be high if
the $.">O,OOO quota is to be filled. First
and second - day sloughing might
| might very well make the drive a
failure.
