### 
Dutiful words of journalistic remonstrances
just aren't worth the space we have to allot to
them, and yet to keep the ghosts of former vol
umes from pounding on the walls of the Shack
at night, we are forced to mention the current
student body elections as things of great im
portance.
You know better than we do, because we are
by profession idealistic, that student govern
ment is simply what the people in it, make it.
Ah hah . . and now that you've admitted it,
that's where we step in. Today and Monday are
the last time to make sure that the people we
want to see in it, get into it.
The usual reasons are there, plus these: The
people on next year's Excom will have to grope
with an entirely new and untried system of
representation by living group areas instead of
by class.
They will also have that much-talked about
and little understood problem of reconverting to
a peace time school.
What's new about all this? Brother, your
friend won't thank you for ill-considered votes
that put him in a spot like that. That's all.
