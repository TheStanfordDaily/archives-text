BUY BONDS TODAY
V/ith the undignified rout of prominent Nazis
just accomplished, it is strange perhaps that it
never seems to cross the minds of Americans
that there may be a lag between European vic
tory and the pursuit of the war in the Pacific.
We do not expect anyone from the generals
to the most worn buck private to lay down on
the job from here on in.
And though we know all the reasons why this
is so, we aren't always willing to apply the same
reasoning to our personal psychology.
With the opening of the Bond Drive today,
there will be no guns fired and no time for a
great deal of hullabaloo; the committee, how
ever, has planned a number of events to keep
the drive in our minds and the rest is for us to
do.
If we are honest with ourselves we won't per
mit this drive to lag or excuse any neglect on
our parts.
The drive must compete with many house
functions, elections, and the midquarter flurry,
its success depends on our cooperation.
It's a failing that we inherit from good ole
pithicanthropus erectus, that after the first real
tasle of victory, we will be more spurred to
indolence than encouraged to duty; there is no
better time to overcome this vestigial stupidity.
