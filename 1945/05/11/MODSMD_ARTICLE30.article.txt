### "NAILS" BRICKLIN 
There was a tough job to be done in Stanford's
Mechanical Engineering Lab and six ASTP veterans
were just the men to do it. Volunteers all, they realized
that chance had selected a worthy crew.
The sextet went into a huddle to plan the afternoon's
campaign. The squad leader rummaged thru the bot
tomless pockets in his fatigues, and after distributing
the oranges he found there, finally located the "Poop
Sheet". Every detail was carefully gone over. The lab
instructor was tough, he really made everyone toe the
mark. He finished the job of "zeroing in".
"Kiddies, let me remind you to take it easy. Try to
get the feel of the values, or we'll have the lab in our
lap. Do you follow me on that?"
"Check with you there, Chief," was the answering
chorus.
The boys were ready for a dry run. At the terse
command of the squad leader, the engineers snapped
to attention and reported.
"Knockmeter, wattmeter, manometer, and tacho
meter correct."
"Oil gage, gas gage, pressure gage and stop watch
correct."
"Data sheet, sliderule and pencil correct."
"Ail correct."
You could tell these were well trained men, a team
really geared for action.
The experiment was proceeding according to plan.
The dynamometer (they have one at Cornell, too; was
turning smoothly when there was a loud crash. A jet
of water shot up into the air from a ruptured pipeline.
"That does it! The fickle finger of fate has found its
mark again," cried the 8010.
"Try to plug up the hole wilh this tube," ordered the
boss.
"Tough, it's too short."
"Sonuva gun, it can't ho too short. Well, someone
will have to hold it in place."
"But there isn't anyone lefl to do it," chimed in the
others.
"Put more men on the job," answered the bos 7,, "put
more men on the job."
This accident was taken care of just as all others,
the universal fudge factor was applied to all readings.
The gang turned in the usual report, "Mission ac
complished."
