Veteran's organizations have been formed in most
colleges and universities in the United States, where
service men returning to civilian life might find some
opportunity for comradeship and social activity. In
Stanford however until recent days no veteran's or
ganization has been formed, as it has been felt that
ex-service men would feel better if they were not dis
tinguished as a group but were treated as other civ
ilians with no other designation.
Many veterans on this campus have felt the need
of an organization, however they have joined veterans
organizations such as the American Legion and Vet
erans of Foreign Wars, which afford them at least
some social expression.
These organizations are unfortunately reactionary
and nationalistic in nature and do not express the lib
eral views of the thoughtful student veterans repre
sented in this school. Most of them wish in particular
to J'orget the militarism manifested established vet
eran's organizations.
Recently on this campus a group of enterprising
veterans chartered an organization which meets in
formally every Wednesday noon in the Union Dining
Hall.
The group is designed to promote the scholarship of
the veterans and to afford them an outlet for social
activity.
Another purpose of the group is to provide an outlet
for uninhibited student expression upon matters of
world as well as personal concern. The organization is
opposed to war, militarism, and' nationalism and
champions individuals of all races, colors, and creeds.
The value ol such a group as an organization is
worthy of student discussion. Whether such a vet
eran's group will prove beneficial in assisting the vet
eran to adjust himself to school life and a better chance
to express himself of course is debatable.
Nevertheless the group does exist on campus, and
since they have so spontaneously acted to form this
organization, a need for it certainly must be felt.
If nothing else they will assist the hundreds of vet
erans who will enter this university in coming years
to adjust themselves to school life by associating with
other veterans who have already undergone these diffi
cult problems of adjustment to civilian life. Further
more the new veterans will feel much more at ease if
they associate with people of a similar background.
Sooner or later most returning servicemen will find
their way into organizations where their rights may
be protected and where they may find expression. In
evitably there will be veteran's organizations on every
campus in the United States, composed of students
who have undergone very much and are vitally alive
to world problems. This process has begun on our cam
pus. Let us trust that the students will benefit from
this organization. It is worth a trial anyway.
