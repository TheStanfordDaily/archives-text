To the Editor:
Now that the war is over in Europe, many are turn
ing their thoughts to a pre-war Stanford with games,
big name bands, and the like. In fact, we had a lot of
talk about these things even before V-E Day arrived.
But any return to such a status will be gradual. That
overworked and trite phrase is still true: "There is a
war on." And because of this war, we still have a job
to doâ€”one which we, iis students, have not met alto
gether successfully.
Besides doing our part in civilian war work, we are
here to get an education which will qualify us for
building this new world. We are on trust to get the best
education possible.
To do this, we need not only a good educational
program, which is the Universitie's responsibility,
but we must put ourselves in the best condition
for getting that education, which is the student
body's responsibility. The low morale of students,
not so bad now, but at its worst during Fall Quar
ters, does not put us in this best condition.
Just as soldiers need furloughs, so do we need some
thing to give us changes of atmosphere. Saturday night
dances do not suffice; Saturday afternoon football
games did. Now that we have no football team; now
that we are coming to another war time Fall Quarter;
we must do something to strengthen the spirit and
unity of our student body that will, until sports return,
meet the need.
Last week, a letter in the Daily called on student
leaders to wake up. It showed that lack of sports
alone is not our trouble. This is true, and it is true
because THE NEED sports satisfied IS GREATER
THAN IT WAS, and because WE ARE DOING
LESS ABOUT IT.
It is our job to do something about this problem.
Surely, with our Memorial Auditorium, our barbecue
pit, and other campus facilities, we can find satisfac
tory activities. We do not use the Memorial Auditorium
one half as much as we might, and the possibilities for
different kinds of assemblies and functions there are
tremendous.
We are now revising the ASSU Constitution. We are
now entering another Spring election. This is the logi
cal time to think about next year. We now have two
chances in which we can and must begin to meet the
problem. It is up to us to set our sights to Fall Quarter
and prepare to make il a successful one.
Sincerely yours,
James C. Emerson, Jr.
Student Manager.
(Editorial Note- The following letters from the A. S.
S. U. office are about the only really nice letters we get
to bring to readers of Campus Opinions who are con
tinually being chastised admonished and scourged in
these columns; but we think these should make up for
a lot.)
