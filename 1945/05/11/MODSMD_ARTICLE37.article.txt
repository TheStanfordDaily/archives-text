# Comic Opera Opens May 24
## 
### 
"The Merry Wives of Windsor,"
a comic opera by Otto Nicolai, based
on the Shakespeare comedy, will be
presented in the Memorial Audito
rium May 24, 25, and 26 by the Stan
ford Players and the Division of
Music.
F. Cowles Strickland of the De- ,
partment of Speech and Drama will
supervise the entire production.
Herbert Jan Popper of the Division
of Music will direct an orchestra of
approximately 50 players and a
chorus of 40, plus 12 soloists.
Wendell Cole, technical director,
has designed a modern setting which
will facilitate the shifting of scenes
and permit the opera to be played
without waits between the scenes,
even though there are nine of them.
"This gay and tuneful opera is
best known for its overture, which
is a perennial favorite with concert
orchestras and most of the majoi
symphony orchestras. All of the
melodies of the overture are taken
from tlx.' opera itself," Mr. Strick
j land said.
