Fortune seems to be smiling fav
orably on the athletic situation at
Stanford. The recent Navy decision
to open new training schools has
given us 300 eligible men to com
pete in athletic activities.
01' course, it cannot be expected
that all of these naval trainees will
be football or basketball players,
but they will undoubtedly be in
good physical condition, and they
will be available. Many coast schools
would have been in the same boat
as Stanford had it not been for Navy
and Marine training programs. Just
look at California's football lineup
for last year—only about 25 per cent
of the team were civilians.
Stanford has had training pro
grams too, but AST students are not
permitted to partake in any but
purely local competitive sports, and
most of them wouldn't have time
anyway, due to the phenomenal
amount of units they are carrying.
As I said tin* amount of athletes
that come from 300 Navy men may
not be sufficient, but the fact that
Stanford will have football, alone
will draw many athletes who have
gone to other schools just because
Stanford declared that they would
not field a team. We will undoubt
edly be trampled <jn the first few
seasons after the war is completely
over. Other colleges that have
kept bringing out teams will have
a definite advantage in experience
and, perhaps, manpower.
Some of you may look to indepen
dent teams for an indication of Stan
ford's present athletic strength. It
might even be said that they did not
have very successful seasons, but
this is not a fair consideration. Abil
ity is not lacking, proper coaching is.
With adequate coaching, the Palo
Alto Independent basketball team
could have gone out and licked the
best of them. Team spirit was cer
tainly not lacking; otherwise there
would have been no team at all.
The Palo Alto Independent
baseball team is progressing rap
idly. The inficlding is air-tight.
Batting practice and more work
ing together as a team is all that
is needed. The "Independents"
have two games this weekend, one
with Menlo Junior College and
one with Marin Junior College.
| They will be without the services
of "Doc" Mason, first string chuck-
I er. but Bob Rosburg and Joe Sher
' will attempt to take care of this
item. Both need practice, and the
squad may have to depend on
their now dormant hitting ability
to pile up a sizeable lead. Get
ling your batting eye always takes
a few weeks, and the boys may go
on a hitting spree.
These independent teams are do
ing a great job in perpetuating'
Stanford's athletic spirit, but our re
turn to inter-collegiate athletics
will be a glorious day—may it come
soon.

Batting practice and more work

squad may have to depend on
their now dormant hitting ability
to pile up a sizeable lead. Get

a few weeks, and the boys may go

Fortune seems to be smiling fav
orably on the athletic situation at
Stanford. The recent Navy decision
to open new training schools has
given us 300 eligible men to com
pete in athletic activities.
01' course, it cannot be expected
that all of these naval trainees will
be football or basketball players,
but they will undoubtedly be in
good physical condition, and they
will be available. Many coast schools
would have been in the same boat
as Stanford had it not been for Navy
and Marine training programs. Just
look at California's football lineup
for last year—only about 25 per cent
of the team were civilians.
Stanford has had training pro
grams too, but AST students are not
permitted to partake in any but
purely local competitive sports, and
most of them wouldn't have time
anyway, due to the phenomenal
amount of units they are carrying.
As I said tin* amount of athletes
that come from 300 Navy men may
not be sufficient, but the fact that
Stanford will have football, alone
will draw many athletes who have
gone to other schools just because
Stanford declared that they would
not field a team. We will undoubt
edly be trampled <jn the first few
seasons after the war is completely
over. Other colleges that have
kept bringing out teams will have
a definite advantage in experience
and, perhaps, manpower.
Some of you may look to indepen
dent teams for an indication of Stan
ford's present athletic strength. It
might even be said that they did not
have very successful seasons, but
this is not a fair consideration. Abil
ity is not lacking, proper coaching is.
