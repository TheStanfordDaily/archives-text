# Sing Sign-ups Close Next Week
## 
### 
Only a week remains before
sign-ups for the Spring Sing will
be closed and living groups which
have not entered will have to spend
the two weeks till June 1 listening
wistfully to song practices and the
boasts of singers who are confident
that they will win one of the three
trophies to be awarded.
Martha Austin, chairman of the
Sing, has announced that no instru
ments may be used in accompany
ing the selections, in order to pre
serve the tradition of choral ar
rangements. Any groups may en
ter, with the provision that they
name the song they will sing, and
that women's groups have at least
25 singers. Registering continues in
the A.S.S.U. office today.
