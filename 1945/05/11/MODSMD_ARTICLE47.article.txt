# Tyler, Flacs in Upset Wins
## 
### 
The surprising Tyler Hilltoppers
pulled the most startling upset of
'he current Softball season yesterday
as they toppled previously unbeaten
Monroe, 2-1, in a beautifully played
contest. In another important up
set, the last-place Flacs covered
themselves with glory by nicking
third-place Phi Psi, 5-4.
The Tyler-Monroe game featured
a pitching duel between John Glathe
of Tyler, who hurled an inspired
game, and the famous Joe Sher of
Monroe, who was never better as
he retired the Hilltoppers with no
hits. The masterful pitching of
Glathe plus errorless fielding by his
mates kept the mighty Boozers from
unleasahing the slugging power
which had brought them eight con
secutive triumphs, and in the mean
time, Monroe errors were allowing
the winning Tyler run to score.
The Hilltoppers, after losing five
out of six in the first round, in
cluding two by default, have come
through with two successive wins in
this round and are a dangerous
threat from now on. On the other
hand, the Boozers still hold a one
game lead over the Med School,
which has a 6-1 record. The coming
tussle between these two clubs

should decide the 1945 Softball
championship.
Phi Psi's hard-hitting ten was vir
tually eliminated from the title
chase as the last-place Flacs dumped
them by a 5-4 count. George Mal
loy turned in a fine job on the
mound for the Flacs, as did Tom
Ashley and Luke Pitts of Phi Psi,
who combined to pitch three-hit
ball.
The winning run scored in the
sixth when A 1 Wolf walked, ad
vanced to third, and scored on Bob
Brown's single to right.
In other games, the Med School
Massacred Arguello, 18-6, and Bu
chanan won by default from the
Legal Eagles.
