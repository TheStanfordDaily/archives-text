### GEORGE BRUNN 
Professor Eliot Blackwelder, professor of geology and head of the
Geology Department will retire at the close of the summer quarter, after
more than 22 years of teaching at Stanford.
Asked about his plans for the future, he said they were not definite
as yet.
I Research Liked
"There arc a number of things in research I would like to do," stated

Professor Blackwelder, "problems
that have had to be postponed be
cause of the critical reduction in
our staff caused by the war. But the
future is so uncertain that I have
made no fixed plans."
He will stay at Stanford after re
tirement. "I don't think I'll get
much chance to rest," he said. "My
friends tell me there is always
plenty to keep one busy, like ap
pointments to chairmanships of
committees."
Books Published
Professor Blackweldcr has pub
lished four books and some eighty
research papers. His main interest
is historical geology. Studies of the
history of glaciation in the Sierra
Nevada arc among his best-known
accomplishments.
Prior to Stanford he taught at the
University of Wisconsin, the Uni
versity of Chicago, and Harvard. He
came here first in 1919 for one quar
ter to take Professor Willis' place
during the latter's period of leave.
He returned to his position as de
partment head at the University of
Illinois, but came back in 1922 and
has been here since then.
Stanford Students Good
Working at Stanford has been

enjoyable, he said. The students are
good and have been steadily im
proving, particularly during the war
years when they tend to be more
serious. An increasing number of
girls have become interested in
geology and their efforts have done
much to keep the standards of the
department high. The close asso
ciation of the staff with the U.S.
Geological Survey and the location
of the University, which is eminent
ly suitable for field work, help to
make the Geology Department out
standing.
