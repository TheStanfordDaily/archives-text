### KEN SCHUG 
Some of the dimes contributed
annually by Farm students to the
March of Dimes in January are sent
back to the Stanford Chemistry
Building, where University chemists
are carrying out research on infan
tile paralysis.
Stanford has received several
grants from the National Foundation
for Infantile Paralysis since 1940 to
aid in this research, the most re
cent being a grant of $8,200 for the
period from July 1945 to June 1946.
Funds Provided
The funds have been provided for
this research being carried out by
Dr. Hubert S. Loring, associate pro
fessor of biochemistry, in collabo
ration with Carlton E. Schwcrdt and
Patricia B. Ruth in the Department
of Chemistry and with Professor
Ladislaus Marton of the Division of
Electron Optics. Much of the ear
lier work was carried out in col
laboration with Professor E. W.
Schultz of the Department of Bac
teriology.
The work at Stanford has been
concerned with two of the three
commonly recognized strains of vi
rus which are responsible for polio
myelitis in human beings, the MV
and the Lansing strains. The origi
nal material for these viruses was
obtained from human beings who
had died from the disease.
Cause Sought
The local chemists are working
on the purification and characteri
zation of the submicroscopic agent
responsible for infantile paralysis.
Among the characteristics which
they are trying to find are the size,
shape, appearance, activity in caus
ing the disease, and chemical na
ture.
The work on the MV strain was
performed on the Rhesus monkey,
the only animal besides man which
can get polio from this strain of
virus. The monkeys, which are the
variety most commonly seen in zoos
in this country, had to be sent from
their native habitat in India. The
shipping problem involved some
what hindered the extent of ex
perimentation possible in the MV
strain, although several hundred
animals were used to obtain both
diseased and normal tissue for the
research project.
Diseased Animals
By means of the ultraeentrifugc,
an instrument in which it is pos
sible to spin the virus solution at
high speed, a fraction containing
particles of about the same size was
obtained which was 100,000 to 200,-
000 times as active as the crude
tissue in causing the disease, show
ing that the virus was partly sepa
rated from the other substances
present.
However, further work showed
that a non-infectious fraction of
about the same size was obtained
from normal monkeys, suggesting
that the fraction from the diseased
animals might not be pure virus.
Frozen Tissue
It was later discovered that if
frozen tissue samples were stored
for periods of from one to three
months, a more active fraction could
be obtained from the diseased tis
sues and smaller fractions from nor
mal ones. The cause of this change
is probably a faster decomposition
of normal cells than the virus. Re
search is now being done to deter
mine the nature of the normal frac
tion.
Electron Microscope
Pictures taken by the aid of the
electron microscope have proved
that the virus particles arc spherical
or slightly elongated. This discov
ery has established that the MV
strain differs from the type of virus
which causes a paralysis in mice
sometimes known as mouse polio
myelitis.
For the past year and a half, the
Stanford chemists have been work
ing on the purification and charac
terization of the Lansing strain, us
ing the same general methods as
before. Fortunately, work on the
Lansing strain docs not require the
use of monkeys, which arc difficult
(o obtain, since this strain will cause
(he disease in cotton rats and mice
as well, animals which can be ob
tained easily and in large numbers.

The work on the MV strain was
performed on the Rhesus monkey,
the only animal besides man which
can get polio from this strain of
virus. The monkeys, which are the
variety most commonly seen in zoos
in this country, had to be sent from
their native habitat in India. The
shipping problem involved some
what hindered the extent of ex
perimentation possible in the MV
strain, although several hundred
animals were used to obtain both
diseased and normal tissue for the
research project.
Diseased Animals
By means of the ultraeentrifugc,
an instrument in which it is pos
sible to spin the virus solution at
high speed, a fraction containing
particles of about the same size was
obtained which was 100,000 to 200,-
000 times as active as the crude
tissue in causing the disease, show
ing that the virus was partly sepa
rated from the other substances
present.
However, further work showed
that a non-infectious fraction of
about the same size was obtained
from normal monkeys, suggesting
that the fraction from the diseased
animals might not be pure virus.
Frozen Tissue
It was later discovered that if
frozen tissue samples were stored
for periods of from one to three
months, a more active fraction could
be obtained from the diseased tis
sues and smaller fractions from nor
mal ones. The cause of this change
is probably a faster decomposition
of normal cells than the virus. Re
search is now being done to deter
mine the nature of the normal frac
tion.
Electron Microscope
Pictures taken by the aid of the
electron microscope have proved
that the virus particles arc spherical
or slightly elongated. This discov
ery has established that the MV
strain differs from the type of virus
which causes a paralysis in mice
sometimes known as mouse polio
myelitis.
For the past year and a half, the
Stanford chemists have been work
ing on the purification and charac
terization of the Lansing strain, us
ing the same general methods as
before. Fortunately, work on the
Lansing strain docs not require the
use of monkeys, which arc difficult
(o obtain, since this strain will cause
(he disease in cotton rats and mice
as well, animals which can be ob
tained easily and in large numbers.
Some of the dimes contributed

Stanford has received several

for Infantile Paralysis since 1940 to
aid in this research, the most re

period from July 1945 to June 1946.

Dr. Hubert S. Loring, associate pro
fessor of biochemistry, in collabo
ration with Carlton E. Schwcrdt and
Patricia B. Ruth in the Department

The work at Stanford has been
concerned with two of the three
commonly recognized strains of vi
rus which are responsible for polio
myelitis in human beings, the MV
and the Lansing strains. The origi

obtained from human beings who
had died from the disease.
Cause Sought
The local chemists are working
on the purification and characteri

responsible for infantile paralysis.
Among the characteristics which
they are trying to find are the size,
