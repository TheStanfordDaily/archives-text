# Class of '48 To Carry Farm Through Transition into Peacetime Life
## 
### 
This is our first year at Stanford (or our first
year of life at any college, for that matter), for
we are the Class of '48, a class that has hopes
of seeing Stanford operate on a peacetime basis.
We don't know what college is really like. We
have just heard stories about it—and how won
derful it used to be.
All year various people have told us about
the Big Game rallies, homecoming, the rivalry
between Stanford and Cal, and the numerous
battles over the famous Axe. We have seen the
Axe in the Cellar but it has no real meaning
for us.
We have heard about dances held on cam
pus when everybody attended; there were
enough men to go around then—they did not
have to be imported from nearby service
camps. Our upperclassmen friends have told
us about the many times they trekked to the
city to go dancing and actually rode up in

cars. It seems incredible to us when we think
of going up on the train once or twice a quar
ter as a special treat.
Then just now I was thumbing through some
old volumes of the Daily. Besides reading about
all the big events of former years, I saw that
the Daily staff put out a big paper five days a
week, and thought nothing of it.
Our four years in high school, our most im
pressionable years, were also war-time years.
We had to fight with our parents for the use of
the car because there was never enough gas or
tires for the use of every member of the family.
All the fellows began taking accelerated pro
grams so they could get in a little college before
going into the service. It was all unnatural—
yet we accepted it because there was nothing
we could do about it.
But now, since V-E Day has come, there are
great prospects that Stanford will return to

its former status before our next three years
are over and we leave We even have a
Navy program coming next year and hopes
that we will have intercollegiate football in
1946. Things are looking brighter all the
time.
During the year our student body leaders
have been doing all they could to keep Stan
ford's traditions alive and get the freshmen
integrated into the Stanford way of life. They
have done a good job and we really appreciate
their efforts.
Through their support Stanford has been able
to keep many of its traditions going throughout
the war years—Tresidder hikes, all-campus as
semblies, a Big Game rally, plays, Gaieties,
Spring Show, large Dailies two or three times a
week and if these traditions had not been
continued so successfully, we who are left to
see the war through would have twice as

tough a time of it.
As it is, all we have to do is to carry on
where these students have left off. It won't
be easy but the task is certainly not impos
sible. As our country comes closer and
closer to total victory, more of our men will
be returning and with them more of our
peace-time activities.
It is up to us to see that Stanford's fighting
men are not let down. We want them to come
back to a Stanford that is as perfect as the one
they left.
Because Stanford means so much to us even
when we have not known it at its best, we are
determined that we shall have a chance to bring
it back to its best. We have had just a taste of
what it can really be, but a taste is not enough.
We are going to work hard to see the "Farm"
emerge successfully from its transition period.

THE STANFORD AXE . . . one of the many traditions the "Farm"
will be able to carry on after the war when college life returns to
normal.
