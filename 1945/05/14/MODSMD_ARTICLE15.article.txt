The Allied offensive in the Pacific rolled forward Sunday with Chinese
units smashing into Foochow, port city on the China coast west of For
mosa, and a gigantic Superfortress attack on Nagoya, as American forces
on Okinawa fought a slow, bloody battle against the trapped Japanese
garrison in the southern tip of the island.
The Chinese port of 322,000 population had been held for four years by
the Japanese. It was entered Friday by Chinese troops in an apparent
drive to open a harbor for seaborne supplies to the long-isolated Chinese.
