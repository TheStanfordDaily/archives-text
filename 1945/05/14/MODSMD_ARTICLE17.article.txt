LONDON, May 13 (UP). â€”Prime Minister Winston Churchill revealed
tonight in a victory review that the Germans had hoped to wreck I<ondon
last year with secret super-artillery. At the same time lie bitterly de
nounced the Eire government of Eamon de Valera for imperiling Britain
in her darkest hour of war.
Signifying his intention to remain at the head of the government and
not to be "put out to grass," Churchill said much remains to be done in
Europe if some other form of totalitarianism is not to replace the de
stroyed armed might of Germany.
He diclosed for the first time that the Germans had devised long-range
artillery in addition to their V-l and V-2 projectiles with which they
hoped to hurl shells on London from France and Holland in the autumn
of 1044.
