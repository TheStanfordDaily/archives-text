## "WORK, WORK, WORK" 
### 
Here in the West, deeply conscious of the
Pacific war because of proximity and kinship
with participants and victims, we should not
need to be told that we must "work, work,
work." We know that the war is not over; it
now enters, for us, its most intense period.
With American military strength (and that of
other Allies too, we hope) concentrated in the
Pacific we can look for final victory and, al
though possibly just as uncertain of what we
shall have won as we are at present uncertain
of having won in Europe, we can look ahead to
the days of peace time.
Swift as these days are, even on the quiet
campus, they are swifter yet in taking young
American lives. We have no statistics right at
hand, but we imagine that between the "8
o'clock" this morning and coffee at the Cellar
quite a number of young American friends have
hit beaches on their way to Tokyo and remained
still on the beaches, or slumped in the cockpit
of a fighter plane, or gone up with the mine
sweeper that cleared the path for the landing
barges.
If we could, we would be with them. Pre
vented by sex and age, we are here in college
and we like to think:
If buying an extra bond in the Seventh War
Loan will shorten the war one minute or one
hour . . .
If v/orking in a war plant this summer
will furnish a weapon when it is needed —not
later . . .
If giving a pint of blood now so that it
v/iil be there now to replace that flowing out
now . . .
If dancing and laughing with a boy on his
way from Germany to Japan will give him
something to keep . . .
If knitting a sweater will keep him warm at
10,000 feet . . .
If writing a letter will give a boy something
to think about besides mud and rain and losing
his new watch or his new buddy . . .
If not being impatient with a wounded vet
eran's efforts to readjust himself to civilian life
will make his readjustment one instant short
er .. .
If being a nurse's aide will release a trained
nurse for war duty . . .
If doing all these little and big things and
many others will result in these little and big
things, they,are certainly worth the doing, and
right now is the time to do them.—Helen Pin
