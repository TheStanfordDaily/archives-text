... on the way the women's housing program
is worked out this year and also the way it is
carried out next year. Housing Committee has
worked hard in devising a system for room
choosing that would satisfy all girls, but it is all
the girls, not just one committee, that are re
sponsible for making the system work.
Tomorrow all the girls in Lower Division will
flock to the Ad Building to draw numbers for
fall quarter rooms. Some will be lucky and draw
low numbers, and will probably get one of the
first choices on their list of residence prefer
ences.
Others may draw such high numbers that
c-ven their eighth preference will not be avail
able when their number comes up. They may
not be able to get into a residence they really
want, and will have to be satisfied with what
ever room is left. It may be a hard pill for them
to swallow (having to live where they don't
v/ant to) but all living groups have their merits,
so that if a student makes an effort to be friend
ly she can make herself happy in any of them.
The word cooperation has been used too much
in connection with the women's housing pro
gram. The same is true of the word congeniality.
Nevertheless, these are definitely two things
which are needed in order to make this care
fully worked out housing system a success.
Housing Committee has recommended that
living groups invite their new girls over for

some informal affair before they move in next
year. This is an advisable thing because it will
give the old and new girls a better chance to
know each other before they live together next
year.
The crucial point, however, will come next
year when all the residences will be made up
of both old and new girls. If the Housing pro
gram is to work out, the new girls will have to
take an interest in the house and make a special
effort to be friendly and considerate.
The old girls will have to accept the new ones
and keep them from feeling left out of the
group.
The job should not be too difficult, for we are
all students at Stanford and therefore have that
one interest in common. Since this is the first
trial of such a housing system it is up to us
now to show that we have what it takes to make
it work.—Nancy Bannick.

The word cooperation has been used too much
in connection with the women's housing pro
gram. The same is true of the word congeniality.
Nevertheless, these are definitely two things
which are needed in order to make this care
fully worked out housing system a success.
Housing Committee has recommended that
living groups invite their new girls over for

some informal affair before they move in next
year. This is an advisable thing because it will
give the old and new girls a better chance to
know each other before they live together next
year.
The crucial point, however, will come next
year when all the residences will be made up
of both old and new girls. If the Housing pro
gram is to work out, the new girls will have to
take an interest in the house and make a special
effort to be friendly and considerate.
The old girls will have to accept the new ones
and keep them from feeling left out of the
group.
The job should not be too difficult, for we are
all students at Stanford and therefore have that
one interest in common. Since this is the first
trial of such a housing system it is up to us
now to show that we have what it takes to make
it work.—Nancy Bannick.
