Only one more day of nominating remains
before the all-campus election on Wednesday.
As evidenced from the few nominations listed
so far, either everyone is waiting until the last
day to file his petition either from sheer inertia
or lack of gumption to run, or else Stanford stu
dents are not taking enough interest in their
student government.
We hope this latter is not the case. Provided
it isn't, we know there are numbers of people on
campus who are well qualified to run for an of
fice.
The success of Stanford has depended a great
deal on its student leadership. If there were no
leaders left, we would have no cause to com

ford. All those students who have successfully
handled the various drives and functions
throughout the year and those that have headed
various committees have shown that they are
able to lead others and have the support of
others.
Why aren't they running?
—Nancy Bannick.
