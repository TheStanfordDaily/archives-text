### Cathryn Owen 
A little guy was sitting in a high chair in front
of one of the Underwoods in the Daily Shack.
He was too wrapped up in his diaper to notice
that the vibrations of the typewriter were jig
gling the tin tray off of his high chair. He
didn't even stop typing when the thing clat
tered to the floor.
Over in another corner, there was a more
nervous individual in a bassinet. The sudden
crash startled her, and made her really bite the
toe that she had been gently gnawing on and
cooing over. She glowered coyly from under
her bonnet.
"I'm tho mad at you that I could thpit!" So
she thpat.
You can see how everything was over there.
Tension was flying all over the place. They
were putting out the Frosh Edition, and things
were pretty desperate.
A cub reporter crawled along the floor,
pushing the editor ahead of her in a "pacer."
Her chin was resting on her soiled bib, and
she was deep in concentration. She took a
deep drag on her teething ring.
"Oh, naughty word upon naughty word!"
she cursed softly. It was the first time she had
disobeyed the Fundamental Standard, but she
was so desperate that she didn't even seem to
care.
Everything had gone wrong that day. First
of all, her mother had made her wear crocheted
booties that morning. The editor fiercely twisted
her lock of hair as she thought about it. Her
mother would have to start realizing that she
was growing up, and was old enough to wear
hard-soled shoes. Then there was this.
The cub reporter paced her over to the
Heinz machine, and drew out a bottle of
strained prune juice. She held the bottle out
in front of her, looked at it for a moment, then
closed her eyes and drank the whole thing.
The cub reporter patted her on the back until
she burped gently.
She started pacing and thinking again. To
make matters worse, the regular staff had been
doing mean little things all day long. They
had put rattles all around, just to distract every
one. Then any freshman who crawled in to
work would spy the rattles, take one, and crawl
into town to show it to his girl friend at the
Paly playground. She was bitter.
Besides that they had left two packages of
gum on the desk.
The editor thnarled, "They think they're
thmart, juth becuth they've got their thix-year
molarth!"
Then there was this. She cursed the safety
pin line she'd stood in all that morning. She
let out a slight howl, as she looked at the
empty desk. It would be almost impossible
to put out a paper without any workers.
She sobbed as she said it. '.To think that
they wouldn't work, j'uth becuth I couldn't
get any United Thtateth Thteel Pinth for them!"
There just ain't no justice!

tered to the floor.
Over in another corner, there was a more
nervous individual in a bassinet. The sudden
crash startled her, and made her really bite the
toe that she had been gently gnawing on and
cooing over. She glowered coyly from under
her bonnet.
"I'm tho mad at you that I could thpit!" So
she thpat.
You can see how everything was over there.
Tension was flying all over the place. They
were putting out the Frosh Edition, and things
were pretty desperate.
A cub reporter crawled along the floor,
pushing the editor ahead of her in a "pacer."
Her chin was resting on her soiled bib, and
she was deep in concentration. She took a
deep drag on her teething ring.
"Oh, naughty word upon naughty word!"
she cursed softly. It was the first time she had
disobeyed the Fundamental Standard, but she
was so desperate that she didn't even seem to
care.
Everything had gone wrong that day. First
of all, her mother had made her wear crocheted
booties that morning. The editor fiercely twisted
her lock of hair as she thought about it. Her
mother would have to start realizing that she
was growing up, and was old enough to wear
hard-soled shoes. Then there was this.
The cub reporter paced her over to the
Heinz machine, and drew out a bottle of
strained prune juice. She held the bottle out
in front of her, looked at it for a moment, then
closed her eyes and drank the whole thing.
The cub reporter patted her on the back until
she burped gently.
She started pacing and thinking again. To
make matters worse, the regular staff had been
doing mean little things all day long. They
had put rattles all around, just to distract every
one. Then any freshman who crawled in to
work would spy the rattles, take one, and crawl
into town to show it to his girl friend at the
Paly playground. She was bitter.
Besides that they had left two packages of
gum on the desk.
The editor thnarled, "They think they're
thmart, juth becuth they've got their thix-year
molarth!"
Then there was this. She cursed the safety
pin line she'd stood in all that morning. She
let out a slight howl, as she looked at the
empty desk. It would be almost impossible
to put out a paper without any workers.
She sobbed as she said it. '.To think that
they wouldn't work, j'uth becuth I couldn't
get any United Thtateth Thteel Pinth for them!"
There just ain't no justice!
A little guy was sitting in a high chair in front
of one of the Underwoods in the Daily Shack.
He was too wrapped up in his diaper to notice
that the vibrations of the typewriter were jig
gling the tin tray off of his high chair. He
didn't even stop typing when the thing clat
tered to the floor.
