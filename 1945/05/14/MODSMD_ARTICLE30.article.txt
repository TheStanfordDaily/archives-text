# Reporters Hear of Press Club Legend
## 
### ROD BROWNING CATHRYN OWEN 
" 'Tombstone' was the name of the
black cat we used to have at the
Press Club. He would always sit by
the fire while we were talking. Poor
old Tombstone couldn't talk, of
course, so everything we said in
front of him was secret. Now when
we say something is under the sign
of the black cat we mean that it is
strictly off the record." This is the
way Jack Hanley, I.N.S. Pacific
Coast editor, told of the black cat
legend, at the Press Club luncheon
yesterday.
He then explained, though, that
everything said by the Iranian
and Chinese delegates and Lucien
Aigner, present that afternoon,
would be behind the black cat's
back.
Comparison of Conferences
Lucien Aigner, a newspaper man
who covered the League of Nations
during the last war, and who is now
doing feature work for a New York
syndicate at the San Fiancisco Con
ference, made a comparison of Ge
neva and San Francisco during
Conference time. "They are quite a
bit alike in that they both brought
people from all different parts of
(he world together," he said. "San
Francisco is friendly, though, and
the people have welcomed the dele
gates whole-heartedly, whereas the
people of Geneva were cold and un
friendly."
He stated that he definitely had
more confidence in the present
Conference than the one at Geneva.
"Not that we have learned so much
since then, but we now have a new
force behind us. This is American
youth. People are coming nearer
(he realization that you can't change
the world which lives between wars,
unless you recognize the fact that
human relations lie at the base of
international relations."
Iranian Representative
Dr. Suratgar, Tehran newspaper
editor and Iranian press representa
tive at the Conference, said that he
was amazed at the interest Ameri
cans took in international affairs.
While Europe was in its Dark Ages,
he said, Iran kept the light of learn
ing bright and held back the in
vading hordes from Turkestan.
In speaking of Iran's international
position, he pointed out that it is
often regarded as "just another little
country." "The only way we can
plan a sound peace, though," he said,
"is to treat all nations alike, large
and small."
Dr. Suratgar was accompanied by
Marie Etemadie. 19-year-old Iranian

girl who is serving as an accredited
correspondent at the Conference. In
perfect University English, with a
touch of American slang, she told
what she called her funniest story.
It was about her visit with the wife
of an Indian maharajah. "I guess
they were trying to be modern," she
said, "because they had a refrigera
tor in each room, with cokes in each
refrigerator."
Chinese Delegate
The last speaker of the afternoon
wÂ«is Dr. Chen Chihmai, member of
the Chinese delegation to the Con
ference. He served as a counselor
to the Chinese Embassy at Bretton
Woods, Dumbarton Oaks, the Civil
Aeronautics Conference at Chicago,
as well as participant at the Geneva
Conference in 1932. In talking about
his native land Dr. Chen said, "It has
been eight years since the war first
started in China, and 14 years since
China lost Manchuria to Japan.
Probably the only thing which has
enabled my people to carry on is
their spirit and devotion to a cause.
These people are fighting for a so
ciety based on security rather than
aggression. We are offering this phi
losophy of peace to all other nations
with a sincere hope that they will
adopt it."
