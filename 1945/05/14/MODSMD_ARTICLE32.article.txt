# 'Song To Remember' Gets Hearty Approval
## 
### 
Sometimes you have to be in a
certain kind of mood to enjoy a film
such as "A Song to Remember," but
at any rate, this reporter gives it his
hearty approval as one of the best
pictures in a very long time—this
quarter, by all means.
Starring Merle Oberon as George
Sand and Cornel Wilde as Chopin,
the movie features a battle between
the dominant will of Sand and the
fatherly attitude of Chopin's music
teacher, Paul Muni. The music pro
fessor's attempts to release his prod
igy from the evil influence of the
female author makes the film a psy
chological battle between the sexes.
Chopin's music alone would boost
the picture's success, but the story
involved, unlike the "Moonlight So
nata," is strong, interesting, and
touching. Filming the picture in
technicolor also helped in increas
ing this reviewer's satisfaction.
Nearly every Chopin composition
of wide circulation was played ; at
some time during the picture and
one could easily slide down in his
chair and slip off into dreamland.

The value of the picture doesn't
come over one until near the mid
point when the plot begins to un
"old.
Going from the sublime to the ri
diculous is to mention the Blondie
picture "Leave It to Blondie." Even
though it stars Penny Singleton, Ar
thur Lake, a couple of genius off
spring, and Daisy and her menag
erie, the Li' 1 Indian turns a gigantic,
swollen thumb down on this farce.
Bumstead was never like that. The
putting of such a feature with the
main billing was not only in poor
taste, but bad, besides. Lokey
