# Monroe Tackles Phi Psi; Med School, Macs Meet
## 
### BOB GILKEY 
Monroe's Boozers, after suffering
their first loss of the season last
Thursday, hope to return to then
winning ways on Tuesday as they
engage the third-place Phi Psi ten,
a powerful club which was upset
last week by the Flacs. In the first
round, these teams turned in a
piperoo of a game, with Monroe fi
nally winning by a 3-2 count.
Joe Sher, who twirled a no-hitter
in losing to Tyler on Thursday, will
again handle the hurling chore for
Monroe, while Tom Ashley, Bob
Stephens, and possibly Luke Pitts
are on hand to pitch for Phi Psi.
Pitts has been hampered by a sore
back since early in the season, but
looked mighty good in pitching the
last few innings against Arguello
and the Flacs. Ed Luce and Bob

Rosburg pace the Boozer hitting at
tack, opposed by the powerful slug
ging of Tom Ashley, Tom Hood, and
Bob Nes'bit.
Another feature contest on Tues
day brings together the second
place Med School and the giant
killing Flacs. The Med School, with
a 6-1 record, is hot on the heels on
Monroe, but they can expect trouble
from the much-improved Flacs, who
have won two out of their last three
games. Doc Mason, former Stanford
varsity star, sparks the Med School
from his shortstop position, while
Barry Webber takes care of the
mound duties.
The Flacs owe much of their im
proved fortune to the hurling of
George Malloy, who pitched a mas
terful game against the hard-hitting
Phi Psi's, but the cellar-dwellers
also have their share of hitters, in
cluding Bob Gettys, Bill Rosenfeld,
! and A 1 Wolf. While the Med School
: rules as the favorite, they may run
into unexpected difficulties if they
count on a walkaway triumph.
Tyler's vastly improved Hilltop
pers, fresh from their startling win
over Monroe, can move into a tie
for fourth if they defeat Buchanan.
The Hilltoppers were only able to
I notch a single victory in the first
1 round, but since the opening of the
second round, they have established
themselves as one of the strongest
teams in the circuit. John Glathe,
who stopped Monroe's formidable
crew with only two hits, will pitch
for Tyler against Buchanan's ace
pitcher and hitter, Frank "Slugger"
Hoffman, who has been the back
bone of the Buchanan ten all year.
Sheldon Butt may also see consid
erable action on the hill for Bu
chanan.
The powerful Tyler slugging at
tack should prove an important fac
tor in determining the outcome of
the game, with such batters as Den
nis Fox, Ed Hall, Joe Pickering, and
Bob Slobe on hand for the Hilltop
pers.
Arguello and the Legal Eagles,
tied for the sixth spot with three
wins and six defeats, tussle in the
fourth game, with Tony Ortega's
up-and-down ten ranking as slight
favorites over the slipping Eagles,
who have lost their last five games.

mound duties.
The Flacs owe much of their im
proved fortune to the hurling of
George Malloy, who pitched a mas
terful game against the hard-hitting
Phi Psi's, but the cellar-dwellers
also have their share of hitters, in
cluding Bob Gettys, Bill Rosenfeld,
! and A 1 Wolf. While the Med School
: rules as the favorite, they may run
into unexpected difficulties if they
count on a walkaway triumph.
Tyler's vastly improved Hilltop
pers, fresh from their startling win
over Monroe, can move into a tie
for fourth if they defeat Buchanan.
The Hilltoppers were only able to
I notch a single victory in the first
1 round, but since the opening of the
second round, they have established
themselves as one of the strongest
teams in the circuit. John Glathe,
who stopped Monroe's formidable
crew with only two hits, will pitch
for Tyler against Buchanan's ace
pitcher and hitter, Frank "Slugger"
Hoffman, who has been the back
bone of the Buchanan ten all year.
Sheldon Butt may also see consid
erable action on the hill for Bu
chanan.
The powerful Tyler slugging at
tack should prove an important fac
tor in determining the outcome of
the game, with such batters as Den
nis Fox, Ed Hall, Joe Pickering, and
Bob Slobe on hand for the Hilltop
pers.
Arguello and the Legal Eagles,
tied for the sixth spot with three
wins and six defeats, tussle in the
fourth game, with Tony Ortega's
up-and-down ten ranking as slight
favorites over the slipping Eagles,
who have lost their last five games.
Monroe's Boozers, after suffering
their first loss of the season last
Thursday, hope to return to then
winning ways on Tuesday as they
engage the third-place Phi Psi ten,
a powerful club which was upset
last week by the Flacs. In the first
round, these teams turned in a
piperoo of a game, with Monroe fi
nally winning by a 3-2 count.
Joe Sher, who twirled a no-hitter
in losing to Tyler on Thursday, will
again handle the hurling chore for
Monroe, while Tom Ashley, Bob
Stephens, and possibly Luke Pitts
are on hand to pitch for Phi Psi.
Pitts has been hampered by a sore
back since early in the season, but
looked mighty good in pitching the
last few innings against Arguello
and the Flacs. Ed Luce and Bob

Rosburg pace the Boozer hitting at
tack, opposed by the powerful slug
ging of Tom Ashley, Tom Hood, and
Bob Nes'bit.
Another feature contest on Tues
day brings together the second
place Med School and the giant
killing Flacs. The Med School, with
a 6-1 record, is hot on the heels on
Monroe, but they can expect trouble
from the much-improved Flacs, who
have won two out of their last three
games. Doc Mason, former Stanford
varsity star, sparks the Med School
from his shortstop position, while
Barry Webber takes care of the
mound duties.
