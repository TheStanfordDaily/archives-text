The main objective of the Daily
sports staff these days seems to be
the worthy task of instilling school
spirit and interest in athletics among
the Stanford student body, in an
ticipation of the glorious day when
Stanford once again resumes inter
collegiate sports. The Frosh Edition
sports staff, not to be outdone, adds
its feeble voice to the chorus.
For the present, campus sports en"
thusiasts must be content with a
minimum of sports activity. There
is, of course, the Palo Alto Inde
pendent baseball team, comprising
the best diamond talent on the cam
pus; there is the intramural soft
ball league, which plays out its
schedule every Tuesday and Thurs
day afternoon on the sunken dia
mond; and there are the Stanford
athletes, such as Gordon Levy and
Ed Luce in track, John Brock in
tennis, and Bob Rosburg in golf,
who are bringing athletic fame to
the Farm with their performances
for outside organizations, but for
the most part, local sports remain
in a rather dormant condition.
Therefore, until the situation
clears up, Stanford sports fans must
be content with the memories of the
famous Indian teams of old —the
teams that have become legendary
in Stanford sports history. The
"Wow Boys" of '40, with Frankie
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, and Norm
Standlee; the basketball team of '42,
with Howie Dallmar, Jim Pollard,
and Ed Voss—these great aggrega
tions are fresh in the minds of most
Stanfordites, and for those whose
memory goes back farther, there
are, of course, the "Vow Boys" of
'33-'35, with Bobby Grayson, Bones
Hamilton, and Bob Reynolds. But
most sports fans, ever anxious to
exercise their lung power, are hard
ly content with mere mmemories
and sorely miss the color and ex
citement that accompany intercol
legiate athletics.
The outlook for the future is not
too black, however. The arrival of
300 Navy trainees in the autumn
combined with the sustained inter
est among sports-minded Stanford
ites and the favorable progress of
the war produces an optimistic
viewpoint among those who fervent
ly hope for the return of intercolle
giate athletics and the dawn of a
new era in Stanford sports. Until
that great day, the Farm faithful
must keep their hopes high and their
school spirit intact.
