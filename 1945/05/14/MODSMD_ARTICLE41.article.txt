# Our Hasher Sez: Lorry Lokey
## 
### 
Now that the swimming season
is in full bloom, more and more
girls are journeying to the top of
Hoover Tower. Seeing as how the
tower affords a good view of men's
swimming pools, where the use of
suits is curtailed, many a sight
seer wishes she had a pair of bi
noculars. A person renting such
instruments up there could work
his way through school.
All! That Spirit!
The Daily staff was saddened last
week when some well-meaning fire
man removed the swivel chair and
the beer bottle from the Shack's
roof above the main and only en
trance. No longer will people from
all parts of the country see that
monument symbolizing the feud be
tween the pulp edition on the sec
ond floor of the Journalism build
ing and the Stanford Daily. No
longer will visitors passing by that
little white Shack remark about
the beer bottle, "Now that's the
spirit."
Future Clothing Problems
A few of us hashers were having
a discussion over the future of wo
men's clothing fashions. Someone
remarked that he was looking for
ward to the coming of glass dresses.
Immediately another hasher or
masher, chirped up with, "And my
ambition always has been to be a
window washer."
We Have Troubles Too
A hasher in one of the women's
dining halls accidentally dropped a I
table knife on a visitor's dress. Dur- ]
ing the ensuing excitement, he ad- !
ded insult to injury by saying, j
"Gee, lady, I'm sorry as hell." She
must have been also. That hasher,
by the way, is now in the Army
where the customers don't wear
dresses.
Poor Frosh.
This frosh edition of the Daily
was put out entirely by the blood, I
sweat and tears of the freshmen —
correction—freshwomen, millions of J
em. Yesterday those on the staff i
rating above the freshman year de- j
serted the Shack and dashed to the
nearest phones. All sorts of false
bulletins began to flood the desk.
Everything from the fact that ex
com was holding a special meeting
today to the revelation that the Eng
lish delegation to the World Con
ference was on campus, was phoned
in to weary desk workers. At times
during the day some ambitious night |
editor would attempt to steal the j
assignment sheet or to pin up false
assignments on the board. All day
long the managing editor alternated
between tearing out her hair and
then the editor's.
What Luck!
One member of the Daily staff I
recently went to see the Confer- !
ence, but found that he couldn't j
get in without a ticket. Making his j
way past the guards, he went up |
to a booth and asked if he couldn't j
have a ticket. The girl hesitated but
then gave in when he said the magic j
words "Stanford Daily." It so hap
pened that she was a student here \
once upon a time. After getting in, j
he had to wait an hour for the
Conference to begin. Shortly after
the session did begin, the false sur
render news came out in the form !
of the five-inch headlines in the '

Call Bullet in. That ended one event- I
tul day. But on the next day, Sun
day, he happened to be on hand
when the Russian delegation came I
onto the campus. He was certainly j
a Johnny-on-the-spot that week- j
end.
No Palm Trees in Russia?
One interesting action of the Rus
sian delegation was their stopover
at the head of Palm Drive. It seems
that they were fascinated at the
palm trees and many bushes in that
park area. After getting out of the
limousines and army cars, they j
walked around the area across from
the Frost Amphitheater. During the
visit, they seemed to show little in
terest in the rest of the campus.
Could it be that palm trees aren't
grown in Moscow and Leningrad?
Too Many Dances?
Ex-com did a pretty thorough job
in allotting dates lor social functions
for last Saturday night. With the
aid ol an adding machine they are
as follows: The Toyon Gay Nineties
dance; the Sequoia Play Ride dance;
Russell's South'n Heav'n dance;
Roth s GPB Club; and Ram's Head's
Spring Show. Of course you could
have gone to a show in Paly if
there was "nothing happening on the
campus."
