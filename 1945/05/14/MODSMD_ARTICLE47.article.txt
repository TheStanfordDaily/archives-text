# City Policeman Describes Delegates to Reporters
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN ROD BROWNING 
There isn't much activity around
the War Memorial Opera House in
San Francisco on Sundays. The re
stricted area around the Opera
House is deserted except for a few
pigeons. Policemen and soldiers in
white helmets and white gloves
stand in two's, talk and laugh, and
tell an occasional curious sightseer
to move on.
Yesterday afternoon, a private re
cital was being given in the Opera
House, so we were allowed to go
as far as one section of the lobby.
We knew that it wouldn't be pos
sible to see or talk to any delegates,
but we were hoping that we could
find a caretaker or janitor who felt
like talking.
Apparently all of the janitors

were hidden safely behind the
signs saying "restricted," so we
decided to approach one of the less
formidable-looking policemen. He
answered our questions about the
time the sessions open and how
we should go about getting passes,
but quite obviously wasn't inter
ested in chatting.
"Have you seen many of the dele
gates?" one of us asked, fishing
madly for an excuse to keep him
talking.
"Oh, I've seen 'em all." He was
smiling now. He clasped his hands
behind asi back and proudly leaned
backward. We were making prog
ress, but he still wasn't ready to
talk.
"Did you see Molotov?"
"Yeh. He was a nice-looking
man. Plain in a way, but intel
ligent. Lot different than Eden.
Eden was quite a ladies' man.
Good dresser, and I guess the
women thought he was a good
looker too. They all Hocked down
to get a look at him."
He was relaxed now, and we
could tell that he was just a little
proud about everything he'd seen
We acted duly impressed, trying to
get him to tell us some more.
"That's certainly a wonderful op
portunity—getting to see all of the
delegates and everything."
He laughed. "Oh, I don't know.
They're just ordinary people.
Nothing special about them."
"Most of them have gone home
by now, haven't they."
"Yeh. I suppose so." He was stern
again, and started looking around
for # trespassers.
He walked briskly away from us
without saying goodbye, and blew
his whistle at a car that was driv
ing too near ihe area.

like talking.
Apparently all of the janitors

were hidden safely behind the
signs saying "restricted," so we
decided to approach one of the less
formidable-looking policemen. He
answered our questions about the
time the sessions open and how
we should go about getting passes,
but quite obviously wasn't inter
ested in chatting.
"Have you seen many of the dele
gates?" one of us asked, fishing
madly for an excuse to keep him
talking.
"Oh, I've seen 'em all." He was
smiling now. He clasped his hands
behind asi back and proudly leaned
backward. We were making prog
ress, but he still wasn't ready to
talk.
"Did you see Molotov?"
"Yeh. He was a nice-looking
man. Plain in a way, but intel
ligent. Lot different than Eden.
Eden was quite a ladies' man.
Good dresser, and I guess the
women thought he was a good
looker too. They all Hocked down
to get a look at him."
He was relaxed now, and we
could tell that he was just a little
proud about everything he'd seen
We acted duly impressed, trying to
get him to tell us some more.
"That's certainly a wonderful op
portunity—getting to see all of the
delegates and everything."
He laughed. "Oh, I don't know.
They're just ordinary people.
Nothing special about them."
"Most of them have gone home
by now, haven't they."
"Yeh. I suppose so." He was stern
again, and started looking around
for # trespassers.
He walked briskly away from us
without saying goodbye, and blew
his whistle at a car that was driv
ing too near ihe area.
There isn't much activity around
the War Memorial Opera House in
San Francisco on Sundays. The re
stricted area around the Opera
House is deserted except for a few
pigeons. Policemen and soldiers in
white helmets and white gloves
stand in two's, talk and laugh, and
tell an occasional curious sightseer
to move on.
Yesterday afternoon, a private re
cital was being given in the Opera
House, so we were allowed to go
as far as one section of the lobby.
We knew that it wouldn't be pos
sible to see or talk to any delegates,
but we were hoping that we could
find a caretaker or janitor who felt
like talking.
