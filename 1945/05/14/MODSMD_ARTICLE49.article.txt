# Dr. Allen's Music Book Dramatized on Radio
## 
### MARGIE HANSON 
"Our Marching Civilization!"
You can't pronounce those words
without feeling the rhythm of the
march which inspired Dr. Warren D.
Allen, University organist and pro
fessor of music and education, to
write the book of that name which
is the first history of the march in
the English language that ties in
with the history of ideas.
The book, brought out by the
University Press in 1043, has re
ceived considerable recognition re
cently by having been chosen by
the Standard School Broadcast to
dramatize in their last three pro
grams this year. The first was given
last Thursday, May 9, and the other
two are scheduled for May 17 and
May 24 from 10 to 10:30 a.m.
"I am pleased that the outstand
ing music education program in the
West should be interested in my
book, and I was more than glad to
co-opcratc with them," said Dr.
Allen.
In last week's program all kinds of
marches were featured, from He
brew chants to the Hallelujah Cho
rus. In next Thursday's program
the tables will be turned on those

musicians whose hobby it is to pop
ularize the classics and a popular
song will be classicized.
"The book is the history of the
spirit of the march," said Dr. Allen.
"I have a hunch that the history of
marching parallels that of the idea
of progress. After the last war the
democratic nations stopped mai'ch
ing and the only countries which
kept military marches in their pop
ular music were Germany, Italy, and
Japan."
"We have had to revive marching
to win," Dr. Allen went on. "A na
tion can't win without spirit. Too
much of the popular music today is
negative."
As an example, Dr. Allen spoke
of "I Don't Want to Set the World
on Fire," the popular song at the
beginning of the war. He said that
the civilians especially these days
need peppy band music. The psy
chological effect of music is unde
niable and Dr. Allen suggests that
it be used in the coming war bond
rally.
Dr. Allen has been University or
ganist since 1918, and professor of
music and education since 1935.
Prior to that time he was Dean of
the Conservatory of Music at the
College of the Pacific.
