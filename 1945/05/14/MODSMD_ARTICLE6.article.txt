# Stanford Is Host to French, Indian, Latin American Conference Delegates
## Consul Gives Informal Talk 
### MARGIE HANSON 
"Latin-Americans aren't really a
type of people who are cither danc
ing and singing or shooting ofT a
'4un. The reason for the many revo
lutions is usually a serious economic
problem," emphasized Walter Mont
enegro, Consul General in Los An
geles and a member of the Bolivian
delegation to the San Francisco
Peace Conference, in his informal
talk before a group of students and
teachers in the lower lounge of the
Women's Clubhouse Friday after
noon at 1:30.
Mr. Montenegro was introduced
by Ronald Hilton, program director
of the Latin American Committee,
and was prcccdcd by Eduardo Arce,
also a member of the Bolivian dele
gation and a professor of law at the
University of Cochibamba, who
spoke briefly in Spanish of the
amendments to the Dumbarton Oaks
plan proposed by Bolivia at the Con
ference.
Mr. Arce also spoke of the efforts
of all Latin-American countries to
obtain at least two of the six non
permanent scats on the Security
Council. The five big powers retain
the permanent seats. Mr. Arce's
speech was interpreted by the third
member of the delegation, Joaquin
Aguirrc.
Economic Problems
Mr. Montenegro's speech dealt
largely with the economic problems
of Bolivia. He said that practically
the only large industry in Bolivia
today was the tin industry, of which
two of the three largest concerns
arc incorporated in foreign coun
tries. This means that a large part
of the wealth of the country is con
tinually going out and none of it,
ever comes back in to alleviate the
serious social and economic prob
lems they facc in educating and
feeding the large Indian population.
What wealth of the country is re
tained, Mr. Montenegro went on, is
employed in maintaining a large
army for defense against neighbor
ing countries. This is one of the chief
reasons, he added, why Bolivia is so
anxious to help in formulating a
world pcace organization so that a
large standing army can be dis
penser with and that expense done
away with.
This lecture is the first in a series
planned by the Latin-American
committee to include other delegates
in the very near future.
Mr. Aguirrc did graduate work at
Stanford last quarter and is now a
member of the Bolivian delegation.
