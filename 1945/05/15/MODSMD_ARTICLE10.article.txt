To The Editor:
Stanford friends of mine, both undergraduate and
graduate, who left the Farm to enter the services, in
many instances plan to return to Stanford to continue
their studies.
A few have come hack already. The Army's plan
for demobilization will send back more. Victory over
Japan will send back the rest. I know they often
wonder—they often write and ask—to what sort of
a school they will be returning.
The only answer is that Stanford is different, that it
has changed. They, in their turn, don't resent this
change, they only hope that the changes are not irre
vocable.
These fellows know that what has made Stanford
great to them is that it exists for its students. They
accept the fact that a war-time student body has to
make war-time changes. They, unlike most of Stan
ford's present undergraduates, know what a peace
time Stanford should be like; and-when peace returns
that is the kind of Stanford they will want to have
waiting for them. It is not unlikely that future stu
dents will want that kind of a Stanfoi'd too.
This preamble is simply to introduce a graduate's
request for caution among the undergraduates to
wards changes that will be binding to the men who
return.
To mention a specific instance: The new form of
representation on Ex-Committee, while it doubtlessly
seems desirable at the present time, may be much less
suited to the postwar Stanford than the old prewar
form that served the student body so well for many
prewar years.
When the fraternities are reopened it cannot help
but point up hall-row differences. In prewar times
the men (unlike the women) seemed to find hall-row
differences negligible. This commendable attitude that
existed among the men can only be injured by having
Ex-Com members represent either halls or fraterni
ties.
And that is what living group representation will
tend to do.
My request is that you who are undergraduates, by
all means change things at Stanford to suit your
selves, and the strange times in which you find youy
selves. But do not expect to improve upon a pre
war Stanford that has not existed for two and per
haps three years and which can be but dim in your
undergraduate memories.
When the fellows come back from the services, please
have their old Stanford waiting for them. When peace
time classes again enter Encina and Roble, have the
old Stanford ready for them. Change Stanford all you
will so that you may get the most out of it ("it is
for you . . . "), but make your change temporary.
Earlier I mentioned that some of the men who left
Stanford to enter service have already returned. Stu
dents of war-time Stanford can find them useful coun
sellors. They have come back to the Farm with a

new awareness, a new valuation of what Stanford
means.
Don't be afraid to ask their advice and help. They
will give of it freely if it is sought. These men, and
every quarter there will he more of them, can serve
you well if you will use them.
