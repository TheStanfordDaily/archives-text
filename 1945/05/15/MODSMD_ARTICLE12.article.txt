# Seen from an Ebony Tower

(Santi K. Pal it, Indian scientist at present on this
campus, submits this rejoinder to certain remarks on
the subject of feminine intuition, recently published
in this column.)
Some blind men wanted to obtain an idea of what
an elephant is like and accordingly they were led one
by one into an elephant's stable. After their study was
over each seemed to have a definite impression of what
an elephant looked like, but they differed widely
amongst themselves.
Their interpretations varied with the parts of the
elephant to which they bad had access with their
sense of touch. Their real but limited experience of
the thing only deceived them. Our writer in his
ivory tower has been like one of these blind men
with respect to his study of feminine intuition.
That is what happens when a man, more especially
a bachelor, whose acquaintance is only of the light
side of feminine life, speaks about or tries to under
stand womanly faculties. He has.access only to a very
limited domains of her unfathomable mystery, which
baffles all masculine reasoning.
Women have intuition and history gives ample tes
timony to it. What about Caesar's wife who had a
vision of a star falling out of the firmament the day
before Caesar was stabbed? A clever statistician,
who must, however, beware of proceeding "scien
tifically" from unwarranted assumptions to foregone
conclusions, may find this a serious and hitherto
neglected field of professional study.
Men and women have subtly different reactions un
der the same psychological stimulus, so that it is foolish
to guess about womanly faculties from any system
of reasoning founded on masculine behavior. It is as
though we were to pin our faith on a veterinary sur
geon for the treament of human ailments.
Pity the man who does not know how to handle the
feminine harp except to produce a coarse,.discordant
noise and pity him more for the obsession which blinds
him to the possibilities of this versatile instrument.
Fair readers, pray do not apply your intuition to
assess the follies nestling in the depth of the ivory
tower. It requires 110 intuition to see what is as plain
as daylight. The top of a tower is still too far re
moved from humanity to be a good observation post
for subtleties that defy even the most minute in
spection. â€”Santi Palit.
