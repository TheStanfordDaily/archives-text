The war in China has been stagnant up until now.
Then it suddenly foeused on a swift moving little battle
that has given the Chinese a chance for a counterof
fensive.
The last Japanese offensive cut China in two by
driving a corridor down the Hankow-Canton railway,
linked itself up with friendly garrisons along the
southern coast, and then pivoted inland, towards
Chungking, to finally be stqpped in the mountains.
Its ultimate aim was to knock China out of the war.
and in this it failed. But it did leave the enemy a
dangerous salient.
CHINESE COINTERMOYE
The Chinese then slowly started a process of ring
ing the corridor with airdromes to put pressure on
(lie corridor. Apparently the main one was at Chili -
kiang.
Soon, the Japanese felt strong enough to lash out
at it.and the recent battle started.
But they had no element of surprise. The Chinese
were ready for them, with what few well equipped
troops were on hand.
The C hinese split their forces three ways. One
body was put on the road to Chihkiang. with the
mission of blunting the enemy spearhead and draw
ing reserves into its tip. The other two. on either
flank of the Japanese advance and well concealed,
waited until the central body had accomplished its
mission, then pivoted in towards each other and
caught the Japanese in a vise.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
This brilliantly conducted little battle has turned an
enemy sector well manned for attack, into a gap The
Chinese can either go straight into it towards the
railway, or else draw the enemy into plugging it and
then swerve south towards friendly pockets around
Canton.
Ihe Chinese claim that they are ready to open a
full scale eounteroflensive, hut the Japanese should
he able to contain their break-through with a few
machine guns, considering the practically vertical
terrain in this area, and then move in reserves. The
question is. how much damage can the Chinese do
before those reserves are moved in? The difficult
enemy transport problem will be the biggest factor
in favor of the Chinese, but the amount of damage
can only be ascertained In time.
