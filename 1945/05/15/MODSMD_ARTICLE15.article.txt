campus.
4. Appointment of summer j
quarter officers.
5. Nurses aides' schedules.
Since the 12 o'clock curfew has
been lifted, dances on campus may

ference members decided not to go
ahead and devise a system for hav
ing houses open until 1:30 on Sat
urday nights.
A recommendation will be left for
next year's members that a commit
tee be appointed to work out a place
on campus that could be kept open
until I:3i so that students would !
have some place to go after 12.
Conference passed the revised
copy of the Social Regulations which
now come under the Fundamental
Standard. B. J. Miller, chairman of
Women's Council, read the regula
tions at the meeting. It was decided
that 2 a.m. special leaves be called
train late leaves and apply to a
radius of 30 miles around the cam- >
pus and be used only for public !
means of transportation.
Two late leaves per quarter will 1
be given to anyone attending a play ,
in the Little Theater. The leaves will j
expire one-half hour after the play
is over.
Other points in the Social Regula
tions were clarified in the new copy.
Pam Strathairin, president, re- >
ceived a letter from a lieutenant :
(j.g.) in the WAVES asking that
WAVES be invited down for week
ends as they were last year. Any j
houses that wish to entertain ,
WAVES in the remaining weekends
this quarter are to call Miss Strath- !
airn.
House presidents who know of
students who would make good stu
dent body officers are asked to sub- I
mit their names to Barbara White.
ASSU president, today. They would
serve summer quarter when officer*
are appointed.
Mrs. John Wilson is now in charge
of nurses aides' schedules and may I
be reached at 22144 between 9 a.m. 1
and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday,
and 9 a.m. to 12 noon Saturday. In
case she cannot be reached, students ,
may call Mrs. Benedict at 4584.

South America) then Franco (Span
ish Fascist government) is part of
that underground."
Spain should not be allowed to
enter the existing League at any
cost, he said, until the republican
forces are given a chance after the
peace to change the government .
When a member of the audience
questionel del Vayo on how, spe
cifically, Allied aid was tendered to
the Franco government, del Vavrg
replied that the form was both
rect and indirect: directly, gasoline,
military materials, and other eco
nomic benefits; indirectly, in dis
crimination against any republican
American. He mentioned that rep
resentatives from anti - Franco
newspapers were not allowed in the
United tSates, while the special
agent of the Franco newspaper is
allowed perfect freedom, and uses
it to abuse the United States in his
home newspaper.
Del Vayo drew particular atten
tion to the danger of permitting a
rift in the Big Three to arise over
the Spanish question, since Russia
would never admit Fascist Spain.
He spoke of the work of President
Roosevelt in establishing an articu
lated agreement between the pow
ers of the world in the face of the
most tremendous difficulties and ob
jections, as a miracle. To break up
that coalition by disagreement be
tween the Big Three he felt would
be a tragedy from which the world
could not recover.
Fascism is far from dead in the
world, he pointed out, when a Fas
cist government in Spain, and a Fas
cist government in Argentina is be
ing supported by England and the
United States.
Del Vayo quoted an article which
stated that popular instinct in Spain
has decided that the life blood of
the Franco-Fascist regime is sup-|
plied by the United States, and that*
without U.S. support the Fascist
ogvernment in Spain would be
overthrown.

Mrs. John Wilson is now in charge

that underground."
Spain should not be allowed to
enter the existing League at any
cost, he said, until the republican
forces are given a chance after the
peace to change the government .
When a member of the audience
questionel del Vayo on how, spe
cifically, Allied aid was tendered to
the Franco government, del Vavrg
replied that the form was both
rect and indirect: directly, gasoline,
military materials, and other eco
nomic benefits; indirectly, in dis
crimination against any republican
American. He mentioned that rep
resentatives from anti - Franco
newspapers were not allowed in the
United tSates, while the special
agent of the Franco newspaper is
allowed perfect freedom, and uses
it to abuse the United States in his
home newspaper.
Del Vayo drew particular atten
tion to the danger of permitting a
rift in the Big Three to arise over
the Spanish question, since Russia
would never admit Fascist Spain.
He spoke of the work of President
Roosevelt in establishing an articu
lated agreement between the pow
ers of the world in the face of the
most tremendous difficulties and ob
jections, as a miracle. To break up
that coalition by disagreement be
tween the Big Three he felt would
be a tragedy from which the world
could not recover.
Fascism is far from dead in the
world, he pointed out, when a Fas
cist government in Spain, and a Fas
cist government in Argentina is be
ing supported by England and the
United States.
Del Vayo quoted an article which
stated that popular instinct in Spain
has decided that the life blood of
the Franco-Fascist regime is sup-|
plied by the United States, and that*
without U.S. support the Fascist
ogvernment in Spain would be
overthrown.
The following subjects were dis

A recommendation will be left for

on campus that could be kept open
until I:3i so that students would !
have some place to go after 12.
Conference passed the revised
copy of the Social Regulations which
now come under the Fundamental
Standard. B. J. Miller, chairman of
Women's Council, read the regula
tions at the meeting. It was decided

train late leaves and apply to a
radius of 30 miles around the cam- >
pus and be used only for public !
means of transportation.
Two late leaves per quarter will 1
be given to anyone attending a play ,
