# Famous Basso To Sing Here
## 
### 
This Thursday evening, at 8:15.
Stanford will be fortunate in having
as guest in the Memorial Auditor
ium, Ezio Pinza, famous basso of
the Metropolitan Opera Company.
In his youth, Pinza's musical in
clinations were frustrated by his
parents, who were determined on
his becoming an engineer. But the
young man finally succeeded in
abandoning his engineering studies
at Ravenna and went to Bologna to
study at the conservatory with Viz
zani.
His first important appearance
was in "Tristan" at the Teatro Re
al lo dell' Opera in Rome, where he
remained for two years. After a
short period of opera in Turin, he
went to La Scala where he sang
for three years under the direction
of Arturo Toscanini.
