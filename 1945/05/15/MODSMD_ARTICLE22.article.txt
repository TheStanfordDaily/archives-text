# Monroe, Phi Psi To Meet Again
## 
### 
Going into the last few weeks of
intramural play, league leading
Monroe meets its most vicious con
tender, the Phi Psi, in what might
be the most exciting game of the
quarter. Monroe, paced by Joe Sher,
Ed Luce, and Bob Rosburg, rate as
solid favorites, even after their sur
prising upset by Tyler last week.
But with Ashely, Pitts, Hood. Nes
bit, and Stephens playing good ball,
the Phi Psi have just enough ma
terial to win. Both of these squads
are strong in hitting and pitching,
with the Phi Psi possessing a little
better infield. However, Monroe
makes up for that with a hustling
outfield as well as a more than cap
able infield. Pitching will probably
tell the tale.
In another top game, the up-and
coming Flacks meet the second place
Med School. The Med School has
probably one of the best fielding
squads in the circuit and should rate
as favorites. However, the Flacks
have been playing outstanding ball
and might be just hot enough to
pull another upset.
A very erratic Buchanan ten will
meet the fast-improving Hilltoppers
in the third feature game of the day.
Tyler, with John Glathe, Bob Slobe,
and Joe Pickering, possesses the
power to win, but Buchanan, on its
good days, is not to be trifled with.
Hoffman, who has relinquished his
pitching chores, is still the backbone
of the team, along with Steege,
might turn the tables.
In the only other game, Arguello
meets the Legal Eagles. The pres
sure of tests are off the Lawyers
now, and they might be in good
enough shape to drop Tony Ortega's
squad. The game will be close.
