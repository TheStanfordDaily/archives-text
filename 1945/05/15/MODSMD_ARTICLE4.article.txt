The above cartoon is a freshman's impression of life at the
Daily shack when the frosh edited yesterday's edition of the
paper, an annual tradition around here.
After the day's vacation for the rest of the staff, in which

the streets of Palo Alto for ads to make the full-size edition pos
sible. They seem to have made manifest the spirit of their class,
and it is a spirit which gives us great hope for Stanford's future.
Whether they remain throughout their four years or leave
the campus for a while to do their share to finish the war,
they have already begun to make a place that will always be
waiting for them on the Farm.
