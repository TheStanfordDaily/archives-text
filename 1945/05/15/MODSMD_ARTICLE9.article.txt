PREFERENTIAL, PLEASE!
The preferential vote system comes into the
campus picture again with A.S.S.U. elections on
tomorrow's schedule; and again we emphasize
the importance of looking over all candidates at
tomorrow's election assembly; then marking
down your preferences, in order, for the candi
dates you know.
Your second and third choices will not count
until your first-choice candidate is definitely
out of the running. Not until then will the sec
ond-choice votes on the ballots of your candi
date be tallied and placed in the piles of those
receiving these second choices; and so on until
a majority vote is reached.
Election Board has announced that figures will
be released to the Daily on the total votes of
only the top candidates. These votes will in
clude the second, third, etc., choices of the
preferential ballot. Nothing is gained by mark'
ing one choice only; correct use of the prefer
ential system will allow for the election of the
all-around favorite candidate.—H. D.
