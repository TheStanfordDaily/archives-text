When the election results are tabulated to
night, by rule of Excom, not all of the figures
will foe released to the Daily by Election Board.
We are just as tired as you are about hearing
of freedom of the press and the withholding
of public news, which we consider this to be.
Also, we are tired of the skin-deep philosophy
in political thinking that acquiesces in the
will be released to the Daily by Election Board,
denies it in practice. We want to put it on
record that we oppose this rule upon its incep
tion and hope that in the future it will be re
scinded.
The reason under which the rule stands is
that candidates fear the publication of unfavor
able results. This is simply a poor measure of
any candidate's interest in the office for which
he is running, and perhaps it is a good measure
for gauging that interest.
We look forward to the time when adult in
terest, aided by all the facts available, will be
valued above these juvenile considerations in
campus politics.
