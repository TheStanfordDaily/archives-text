HIGHER MATHEMATICS AND . . .
No life for a lady this is, unless the lady is
also a mathematical beaver (and what lady
would admit it?). Nothing but a one-way ticket
from Difficult to Impossible, from grade-points
to ration points to service points to little green
rebate slips.
Whether you're trying to explain to the folks
at Home that the Bawlout doesn't mean a thing,
or angling for boloney in the Palo Alto marts
of trade, or trying to make two and two add
up to 85, or figuring without the use of me
chanical aids (look, no hands!) what the Book
store owes you, the things you want out of life
these days are beginning to play hard to get.
What ever happened to those books with
the answers in the back?
Campus elections are with us in a big way.
As Stanford goes to the polls, student-body
cards in hand, the local historians are bearing
down on the shift-key, ready for a new para
graph in the current chapter of student gov

ernment (not to be confused with "The Phan
tom Empire").
A lot of new faces are due to appear at the
grindstone, and a lot of desks in high places
are being subjected to the annual house-clean
ing that marks the end of a term.
Some good work is about to enter the filing
cabinet phase, and some good officers are
about to return to private life with the assorted
ribs, raves, and short white hairs acquired in
the public eye.
Responsibility never looks so rosy as when
it must be handed on to others, and those who
have held it never come in for the thank-yous
they deserve until we suddenly look around
and see them going out the door. So before
the door shuts on this occasion, at least one
chorus of goodbye, good luck, is well in order.
And here it is.
