Americans are now active on the West Coast at
tacking the homes and property of loyal Japanese
citizens. No suspects have been brought to trial for
fifteen shooting incidents against Japanese farmers,
Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes declares. The hood
lums grow in their lawlessness, as more Japanese re
turn to their farms and homes.
Many of the white farmers can see that they are
not going to keep the economic beachheads which they
had established on Nisei farms.
Only one incident exists in which the terrorists
were arrested and given a trial. This was an attempt
to dynamite a barn, and the defendants were ac
quitted in shameful defense of the weight of evidence.
These Americans are violating state and national
laws protecting the property of citizens and loyal
aliens.
Many American Japanese homes with service flag
stars in the window have had shots fired through them.
Many American Japanese soldiers are fighting the en
emy at Okinawa, the Philippines, and other Pacific
combat areas.
Economic boycotts and advertising campaigns are
being started with great promise of success against
these unhappy Japanese. Instances of terror have been
cited in localities such as San Jose and Cressy and in
such counties as Placer, San Joaquin. Santa Clara,
Merced, Madera, Fresno. Tulare. Kern, Los Angeles,
and Orange.
This disrespect for American law by our own citi
zens is excellent material to greet the conquered peo
ples of the war whose confidence and co-operation we
are asking.
The silent agreement and approbation that these
acts are receiving is a sign of weakness at the core of
the American nation, its plain people, who in the
final analysis must prove our right to ask other na
tions to respect our way of government and the ideolo
gies upon which it is based.
