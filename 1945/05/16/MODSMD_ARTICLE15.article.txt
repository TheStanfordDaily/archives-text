Everybody is wondering what the next peace con
ference will be like. and. even more important, what it
will produce.
People had the same questions about Versailles,
which, behind ornate and secret doors:
1. Wondered how to quell the rising of Communism
among the soldiery, and talked so long, keeping the
armies mobilized so long, that there was practically a
revolt.
2. Developed a peace on the basis of the "Brother
hood of Nations" and the "Cordon Sanitaire."
3. Told Germany not to rearm and planted the seeds
of so many squabbles between the high contracting
parties that the Allies liad no time t6 watch the Ger
mans in the next twenty-five years, since they were
too busy watching each other.
The present peace conference, however, will prob
ably be based on different grounds. What they are can
be gleaned from various statements, and from the I
German armistice terms.
1. Freedom from want and need, and the resurrec
tion of the economically impossible southeastern Eu
ropean states with full sovereignty.
2. A just and lasting peace, and Russian. British,
and American spheres of influence.
3. The re-education of Germany to peace, and a ;
harsh occupation which will in time withdraw, leav
ing the enemy to plot what he pleases in the way of
revenge.
And so on.
There seems to be only one safe prediction about
the result of all this, and that is that this peace will bo !
as much of a muddle as the last. Like the last, it will '
come into existence in an atmosphere of confusion.
And. like the last time, it might be prudent for us to
realize that a j;ood working post-peace policy with a I
bad peace, is better than no bolicv and a good one.
