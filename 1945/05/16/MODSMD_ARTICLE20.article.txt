# Harlem at Chalet Saturday Night
## 
### 
A little bit of Harlem will be im
ported Saturday night, as the Chalet
opens its doors from 9 to 12 for its
traditional all-campus Darky dance.
Elwood Hart's orchestra from San
Jose will accompany the dancers,
who are inited to wear costumes ap
propriate to the theme.
Chalet women have cornered the
grease paint market in preparation
for an evening in blackface; they
are buying up all the satin in Palo
Alto, according to Chairman Sally
Stone, to make two-tone outfits for
themselves.
