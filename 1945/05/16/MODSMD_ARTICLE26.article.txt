# Freshman Women Plan 'Our Waltz'
## 
### 
'"Ask that favorite man right away,
or else sign up for a blind date from
Del Monte, Moffit, or some of the
other bases so you will not miss
the last Ventura-Roble-Branner
formal of the year, ''Our Waltz,"
which promises to be a big success,"
advise the chairmen of the dance.
The vice-presidents of the fresh
men halls will get blind dates for
the freshmen women this week, and
tickets will be on sale during this
time in these halls at $2 a couple.
Tickets will not be on sale at the
door Saturday night in the women's
gym. The only place that they will
be sold that night will be at the
Roble desk.
Peggy Cox, ticket chairman, has
announced that any women who are
unable to get tickets this week
through freshmen representatives in
the various halls should call her, and
she will make arrangements for
them.
Art Weidner's orchestra will play
a few waltzes to get the couples in
the mood of the theme. Renee

Cohu, chairman of the formal, said
that the hours of the dance may be
changed because of the lifting of the
curfew, but the announcement con
cerning this will be made later ir.
the week.
Patrons for the Roble-Branner-
Ventura Formal are Mr. and Mrs.
Harold Kirkby, Mr. and Mrs. Ro
berto Sangiorgi, Miss Mary Jane
Donaldson, Mr. Edward White, Mr,
Harold Bacon, and the residence
staffs of the three halls.
