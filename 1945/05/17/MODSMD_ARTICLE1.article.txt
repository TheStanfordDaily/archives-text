University students and faculty
members alike have entertained and
shaken hands with noted statesmen
of foreign nations, while unexpected
excitement coursed the campus

and stopped to look up the parallel
lines of the Hoover Library to the
tower.

Viachcslav M. Molotov, Russia's
foreign commissar, was one of the

started. His party, driving in three
limousines flanked by U. S. Army
cars, refused guidance on their brief
visit.
