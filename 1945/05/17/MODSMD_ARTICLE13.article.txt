# Polish Dispute, Conference Problems Reviewed by Eden
## 
### ELLEN MARCUS 
The Rt. Hon. Anthony Eden, Brit
ish foreign minister, faced the huge
crowd of reporters assembled in the
Room of the Dans in the Mark Hop
kins hotel last Thursday and made
the unprecedented announcement
that he could be quoted directly
on anything he said and that all
questions and answers would be
"on the record.'
Described by some as Jove, Kip
ling, and Noel Coward, at one and
the same time, Mr. Eden proved
himself lo be an expert parlimentar
ian and showed that he could give
as well as take it in the 45-minute
question and answer period that
followed his initial address.
All ears perked to attention when
a question was asked about the tick
lish problem of the 1(1 arrested Po
lish leaders. Eden made it clear that
their imprisonment was very "un
happy news" and had complicated
the whole Polish question so that it
would have to be referred to Prime
Minister Churchill, President Tru
man, and Premier Stalin for a solu
tion .
Stand By Yalta
"Britain will stand i>y the decis
ion reached at the Yalta agreement,,"
he continued. "The prisoners in
clude some of the leading figures
of the Polish underground as well
as officials of the exiled Polish Gov
ernment, in London . . . persons we
thought should be included in a
new government at Warsaw." Eden
declared that the arrests "made fur
ther progress impossible" at the San
Francisco Conference.
In an interview with The Daily
later in the afternoon, Mr. Eden
clarified the statement he had made
at the press conference about the
veto powers of Ihc Security Council
by saying that "the Security Coun
cil now possesses the power to ac
actually recommend the terms of
settlement for any particular dispute
. . . as parties to a dispute cannot
vote under this section (paragraph
4 of chapter 8a of the Dumbarton
Oaks proposals), a great power will
not be able to block any such rec
ommendation being made." He also
asserted that "all preliminary steps
short of force shall not be vetoed."
Assembly Powers
In regard to the powers of the
Assembly, Mr. Eden said that it will
now have the power to discuss all
matters, including existing treaties;
but that these treaties (excluding
those made with the Axis nations)
shall remain in force until the world

organization shall take over its du
iics.
He termed the regional security
issue "the most difficult" remaining
before the Conference and did not
as yet sec a solution lo the problem.
Eden said that he believed regional
organizations should operate "as
buttresses lo the world organization
and related to it. Regional pacts
are extremely important," he con
tinued, "but they can't replace a
world organization."
Hope on Trusteeships
"The trusteeship problem has not
been solved, but progress is being
made," he assured the press. "1 am
not un,sanguine about it." He later
remarked that indications point to
ward acceptance of the major United
States proposals.
In answer to a question about
why Britain was so concerned
about the imprisonment of 16 Poles
and not about the millions of In
dians, Eden said that the British
government wants :elf-governmcnt
for India and the ofTer of indepen
dent dominion status is still open
for them lo accept. The plan of Sir
Stafford Cripps is still within reach
as soon as the Indians themselves
can agree they want it.
"But a few thousand thought they
would have more freedom under the
Japanese co-prosperity sphere," he
remarked as the audience laughed
and applauded him at great length.
The independence shown by the

British dominions in voting contrary
to the lead of the mother country
"wildly delighted" him as "now no
body could ever say that the British
Empire has six votes."
Mr. Eden closed his preliminary
| speech with the assertion that
i general conferences would he hold
periodically to review the whole
! charter and proposed amendments
and that the Assembly would de
cide when these conferences were
■ necessary, lie also remarked that
(he members of the world organi
j zation would owe their loyalty
| not to their own governments hut
j to the world organization.
As to the accomplishments of
the San Francisco Conference, Eden
j said, "I believe the four-power
j changes are all improvements. We
should get a much better charter
than that which emerged from
Dumbarton Oaks. If so, this Con
ference need not be ashamed of its
| work."
Prime Minister Churchill once
i said of Eden, "He is the only fresh
j figure of first magnitude arising out
of the generation ravaged by the
First World War ... he holds a po
! sition second to none among the
j foreign secretaries of the grand al
j liance." And as the secretary of the
I British Press Office said when we
| told her how much we enjoyed
| meeting him and how charming he
| was to us, "Yes, everyone likes Mr,
Eden."

Oaks proposals), a great power will
not be able to block any such rec
ommendation being made." He also
asserted that "all preliminary steps
short of force shall not be vetoed."
Assembly Powers
In regard to the powers of the
Assembly, Mr. Eden said that it will
now have the power to discuss all
matters, including existing treaties;
but that these treaties (excluding
those made with the Axis nations)
shall remain in force until the world

organization shall take over its du
iics.
He termed the regional security
issue "the most difficult" remaining
before the Conference and did not
as yet sec a solution lo the problem.
Eden said that he believed regional
organizations should operate "as
buttresses lo the world organization
and related to it. Regional pacts
are extremely important," he con
tinued, "but they can't replace a
world organization."
Hope on Trusteeships
"The trusteeship problem has not
been solved, but progress is being
made," he assured the press. "1 am
not un,sanguine about it." He later
remarked that indications point to
ward acceptance of the major United
States proposals.
In answer to a question about
why Britain was so concerned
about the imprisonment of 16 Poles
and not about the millions of In
dians, Eden said that the British
government wants :elf-governmcnt
for India and the ofTer of indepen
dent dominion status is still open
for them lo accept. The plan of Sir
Stafford Cripps is still within reach
as soon as the Indians themselves
can agree they want it.
"But a few thousand thought they
would have more freedom under the
Japanese co-prosperity sphere," he
remarked as the audience laughed
and applauded him at great length.
The independence shown by the

British dominions in voting contrary
to the lead of the mother country
"wildly delighted" him as "now no
body could ever say that the British
Empire has six votes."
Mr. Eden closed his preliminary
| speech with the assertion that
i general conferences would he hold
periodically to review the whole
! charter and proposed amendments
and that the Assembly would de
cide when these conferences were
■ necessary, lie also remarked that
(he members of the world organi
j zation would owe their loyalty
| not to their own governments hut
j to the world organization.
As to the accomplishments of
the San Francisco Conference, Eden
j said, "I believe the four-power
j changes are all improvements. We
should get a much better charter
than that which emerged from
Dumbarton Oaks. If so, this Con
ference need not be ashamed of its
| work."
Prime Minister Churchill once
i said of Eden, "He is the only fresh
j figure of first magnitude arising out
of the generation ravaged by the
First World War ... he holds a po
! sition second to none among the
j foreign secretaries of the grand al
j liance." And as the secretary of the
I British Press Office said when we

| was to us, "Yes, everyone likes Mr,
Eden."


KT. HON. ANTHONY EDEN and Daily Reporter Ellen Marcus
The Rt. Hon. Anthony Eden, Brit
ish foreign minister, faced the huge
crowd of reporters assembled in the
Room of the Dans in the Mark Hop
kins hotel last Thursday and made
the unprecedented announcement
that he could be quoted directly
on anything he said and that all
questions and answers would be
"on the record.'
Described by some as Jove, Kip
ling, and Noel Coward, at one and
the same time, Mr. Eden proved
himself lo be an expert parlimentar
ian and showed that he could give
as well as take it in the 45-minute
question and answer period that
followed his initial address.
All ears perked to attention when
a question was asked about the tick
lish problem of the 1(1 arrested Po
lish leaders. Eden made it clear that
their imprisonment was very "un
happy news" and had complicated
the whole Polish question so that it
would have to be referred to Prime
Minister Churchill, President Tru
man, and Premier Stalin for a solu
tion .
Stand By Yalta
"Britain will stand i>y the decis
ion reached at the Yalta agreement,,"
he continued. "The prisoners in
clude some of the leading figures
of the Polish underground as well
as officials of the exiled Polish Gov
ernment, in London . . . persons we
thought should be included in a
new government at Warsaw." Eden
declared that the arrests "made fur
ther progress impossible" at the San
Francisco Conference.
In an interview with The Daily
later in the afternoon, Mr. Eden
clarified the statement he had made
at the press conference about the
veto powers of Ihc Security Council
by saying that "the Security Coun
cil now possesses the power to ac
actually recommend the terms of
settlement for any particular dispute
. . . as parties to a dispute cannot
vote under this section (paragraph
4 of chapter 8a of the Dumbarton
Oaks proposals), a great power will
not be able to block any such rec

KT. HON. ANTHONY EDEN and Daily Reporter Ellen Marcus
The Rt. Hon. Anthony Eden, Brit
ish foreign minister, faced the huge
crowd of reporters assembled in the
Room of the Dans in the Mark Hop
kins hotel last Thursday and made
the unprecedented announcement
that he could be quoted directly
on anything he said and that all
questions and answers would be
"on the record.'
Described by some as Jove, Kip
ling, and Noel Coward, at one and
the same time, Mr. Eden proved
himself lo be an expert parlimentar
ian and showed that he could give
as well as take it in the 45-minute
question and answer period that
followed his initial address.
All ears perked to attention when
a question was asked about the tick
lish problem of the 1(1 arrested Po
lish leaders. Eden made it clear that
their imprisonment was very "un
happy news" and had complicated
the whole Polish question so that it
would have to be referred to Prime
Minister Churchill, President Tru
man, and Premier Stalin for a solu
tion .
Stand By Yalta
"Britain will stand i>y the decis
ion reached at the Yalta agreement,,"
he continued. "The prisoners in
clude some of the leading figures
of the Polish underground as well
as officials of the exiled Polish Gov
ernment, in London . . . persons we
thought should be included in a
new government at Warsaw." Eden
declared that the arrests "made fur
ther progress impossible" at the San
Francisco Conference.
In an interview with The Daily
later in the afternoon, Mr. Eden
clarified the statement he had made
at the press conference about the
veto powers of Ihc Security Council
by saying that "the Security Coun
cil now possesses the power to ac
actually recommend the terms of
settlement for any particular dispute
. . . as parties to a dispute cannot
vote under this section (paragraph
4 of chapter 8a of the Dumbarton
Oaks proposals), a great power will
not be able to block any such rec
ommendation being made." He also
asserted that "all preliminary steps
short of force shall not be vetoed."
Assembly Powers
In regard to the powers of the
Assembly, Mr. Eden said that it will
now have the power to discuss all
matters, including existing treaties;
but that these treaties (excluding
those made with the Axis nations)
shall remain in force until the world

organization shall take over its du
iics.
He termed the regional security
issue "the most difficult" remaining
before the Conference and did not
as yet sec a solution lo the problem.
Eden said that he believed regional
organizations should operate "as
buttresses lo the world organization
and related to it. Regional pacts
are extremely important," he con
tinued, "but they can't replace a
world organization."
Hope on Trusteeships
"The trusteeship problem has not
been solved, but progress is being
made," he assured the press. "1 am
not un,sanguine about it." He later
remarked that indications point to
ward acceptance of the major United
States proposals.
In answer to a question about
why Britain was so concerned
about the imprisonment of 16 Poles
and not about the millions of In
dians, Eden said that the British
government wants :elf-governmcnt
for India and the ofTer of indepen
dent dominion status is still open
for them lo accept. The plan of Sir
Stafford Cripps is still within reach
as soon as the Indians themselves
can agree they want it.
"But a few thousand thought they
would have more freedom under the
Japanese co-prosperity sphere," he
remarked as the audience laughed
and applauded him at great length.
The independence shown by the

British dominions in voting contrary
to the lead of the mother country
"wildly delighted" him as "now no
body could ever say that the British
Empire has six votes."
Mr. Eden closed his preliminary
| speech with the assertion that
i general conferences would he hold
periodically to review the whole
! charter and proposed amendments
and that the Assembly would de
cide when these conferences were
