ADDING 2 AND 2
While the United Nations Conference meant
flags, crowds, and golden pillars for the people
of San Francisco, and delightful teas, craning
necks, and charming words to Stanford stu
dents, there was little note of courageous pur
pose, new hope, or renewed effort for the world
in general, in the v/orld conference for security.
The so called "lessons of the last war" have
been freely examined in speeches and the
pre: :; dnd the public that is interested is in
most cases painfully surfeited with them. The
only effective action left has had to come from
the leaders themselves.
They have to face the challenge of a world
cynical of ever obtaining a world "safe for
democracy," or safe for anything else for that
matter.
The record of the war has indicated the sore
subjects and snags likely to come. Unexpected
insight and courage were the only unknown
elements that could make harmony where there
lias been none.
The conference has had as many speeches
as was expected by diplomats, and the guality
did not seem to suffer from the pressure of
news abroad; but the unexpected courage and
insight have not come from any quarter.
The Argentine question was turned into a
question of "we or they," and the winning of
the issue became more important than the ques
tion of whether or not we can do business with
openly Fascist countries.
Using the Argentine question as a "tit for
tat" rebuttal of the Soviet supported plea for
seating of the Polish government, certainly
lowers the international prestige of the confer
ence.
Sr. Alvarez del Vayo at Stanford Monday
found the admittance of Argentina to the Con
ference a slap in the face to all peoples who
have been fighting Fascism against insuper
ably bitter odds. He represents the last Span
ish Republican government whose lack of sup
port we have long decried in the press and
radio as one of the "bitter mistakes" of the
crazy pre-war years.
The Polish question of course has had little
value in the Conference except to create an
issue and a glorious picture of disunity that is
probably overrated. There was a Yalta agree
ment about it, and there will probably be an
other, but with so much dissatisfaction within
and without Poland about both governments,
a coalition should probably do well if arrived
at by judgment rather than the emotion of
who pushed the farthest.
Most essentially tokening the cynicism that
the conference has induced, is the fact that
despite the knowledge of these old and diffi
cult conflicts and the many sides to all of them,
no faith in world organization and justice was
shown by the creation of an over-all agency
of the world, speaking for small and large na
tions alike on the question of justice.
Justice is still presumed to be a different
thing for the powerful and for the weak, and
the degree of common ground seems dimin
ished.
The Russians are distrustful of the Western
Powers; the British have been at this too long
to try new ways; we are sorry to have to face
the fact that it was our place to provide the
incentive, and we did not step into it.
The future is not imponderable and we ear
nestly hope thai the work yet to be done will

strengthen the power of the organization for
security and place the welfare of the world
above the power of even the most powerful
nations, including ourselves; we have made
serious mistakes, and the sin of Germany does
not escape us.
There must also be remedy for evils in the
rule of international law. The status quo does
not insure justice, and unbearable peace can
not be forced upon any country indefinitely
Let us hope that at the San Francisco Con
ference the forces of cynicism will have had
their day, and in the slow rebuilding of the
woild, a new basis for intelligent co-operation
can be found in new ways to back old words.
