"Wail! Wail!" cried Alice, panting for breath as
she ran. "Hold on for a minute longer!"
But Alice was too late. The While Knight lost his
grip on his horse's mane, and, with a tremendous slith
ering clump, fell headlong into the ditch.
"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Alice. "He looked very pe
culiar when he was right side up, hut he is really
much more confusing upside down!"
'I hen one of the projecting iegs began to (witch,
and Alice thought she heard a voice coming from
where the White Knight's* head ought to he.
"Hlurrrump, hlurrurrumph; hlurrup, hlurrup!!" it
said. Then nothing else came hut a stream of small
bubbles.
So Alice seized one of the legs and pulled and
pulled and pulled, until at last the White Knight be
came unrooted, and Alice sat down very suddenly in
what seemed to he an unpleasantly stickery briar
hush.
"Damn!" said Alice vehemently.
The White Knight sat up slowly, and rubbed his
head.
"That's peculiar," he said, ignoring Alice's remark.
"Newton is righter and righter all the time; things
do tend to fall downward."
"Silly!" cried Alice, steel feeling unpleasantly like a
briar-bush. "O'f course they do, and usually onto their
head if they are as clumsy as you!"
"Ah," remarked the White Knight, removing most
of the ditch-water from his ears, "but I am investi
gating it scientifically."
"What!" said Alice. "It seems to me that you fell
off that horse in a most unscientific manner; or at
least in a very uncomfortable manner."
"Science," replied the White Knight disdainfully,
as lie consulted a small portable calculating ma
chine, "doesn't require grace, elegance or comfort;
it requires lots of figures and mathematics. In the
last 427 times I have fallen off my horse I have hit
the ground 420 times; therefore there are 42(5 chances
in 427 that an object falls downward."
"What happened the time when you didn't hit the
ground?" asked Alice, wondering how many times he
would have to fall in order to satisfy his scientific bent.
"Oh," said the White Knight enthusiastically, "that
was wonderful; I got stuck in a bee-tree, and had an
idea for a most ingenious invention."
And he pointed to a huge contraption that was
strapped just behind the saddle. It seemed to be com
posed mostly of bailing-wire and black-enameled hair
pins.
"It's for trapping hornets," he continued, glancing
toward Alice with that hungry look scientists show
when they are seeking appreciation. "It's a remarkable
little device for preventing bee-stings to the place
where one sits down."
"Did you say bees," asked Alice dubiously, "or
hornets?"
"Who cares?" said the White Knight happily. "Bees
or hornets—they're all welcome; what they are is their
business, not mine."
But Alice was particularly puzzled by one feature
of the device, for it seemed that there were two large
openings, one at each end.
"Does it really work?" asked Alice in a tone which
she hoped wouldn't offend the White Knight's pride.
"Well," said the White Knight slowly, "to (ell (he
(ruth it doesn't. It's what we scientists call 'pure
research.' Hawever," he added brightly, "like all
(rue pure research, i( led (o new and utterly fasci
nating discoveries."
And climbing up on his horse he dug a huge bottle
out of one of the saddle-hags and held il up for Alice
to see.
"THE WHITE KNIGHT SPECIFIC SUBSTANCE
FOR BEE-STINGS," said the label, in bright red let
ters.
"Capital stuff!" exclaimed the White Knight glee
fully, "and with a little further research I hope to In;
able to find what it's good for."
"What!" cried Alice. "Isn't if good for bee-slings?"
"Good gracious, child!" exclaimed the While
Knight, amazed at her ignorance of the ways of
science. "Of course il is good for bee-stings—it's
wonderful. I iusf haven't found (he righ( kind of
hee-stings yet."
And as he set off on his way down the trail he
turned to wave Alice farewell.
"Look out!" cried Alice, for she saw him weaving
dangerously in his saddle. Then he made a desperate
grasp for his calculator.
"Four hundred and twenty-eight!" tried the While
Knight bravely, as he slid from the saddle in an un
pleasantly downward manner. "Whumph!!!"
