A MODEST PROPOSAL
To the Editor:
The suicide rate on the Stanford campus has been
mounting higher and higher as frustrated students,
unable to figure out what (he Ivory Tower column
is all about, decide to give it up as a bad job and to
commend themselves to their Maker.
Now I protest this useless wastage of lives on our
beloved campus. Not only does it leave everyone who
tries to decipher these little (!) opera that appear
regularly in your editorial columns a blithering idiot,
but, frankly, the whole thing has me confused.
What are the authors trying to do? I, as one who
has read and likes Lewis Carroll, do not appreciate this
prostituting of his art. Mr. Carroll did not create
"Alice" as a medium for moralizing. What right do
the authors have to do so? Subtle? Perhaps. But
American students, in this day of hard-headed real
ism and blunt speaking, are in no mood to dig out
moral lessons from under a blanket of subtleties. Most
of them probably have not read "Alice in Wonder
land" anyway, and if they did, they probably heard
it told from mother's knee.
"Alice in Wonderland" has its place in the hearts
of tho.se who love it. And so does the Ivory Tower
out of th«- column): of the Stanford Daily.
