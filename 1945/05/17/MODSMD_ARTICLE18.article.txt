# Dr. Wu Stresses China’s Need for More Education
## 
### NADA SKIDMORE 
Quietly speaking to a group of
newspaper women Monday in the
sincere manner which has won her
American respect, Dr. Wu Ti-fang,
only woman Chinese delegate to the
San Francisco Conference, expressed
the earnest hope of the Chinese
people that the UNCIO will insure
them of security from aggression in
postwar years.
Dr. Wu holds many "firsts." She
became the first Chinese woman
college president when she assumed
her present post as president of
Ginling College in 1928. When she
visited America in 1936, she was the
first woman of any nationality to
speak to the Naval War College.
National Leader
One of the 15 women members of
the People's Political Council, she
is the only woman chairman among
the five chairmen of the council.
Questioned as to the chief prob
lems of Chinese women, Dr. Wu
said, "Our chief problem is how to
carry through this last stage of the
war . . . for women are doing their
part."
She listed ways in which Chinese
women help the war's progress
which parallel many of the things
which American women are doing
today: Working in hospitals, doing
clerical work for the Armed Forces,
gathering gifts for soldiers "to com
fort and cheer," and aiding in the
rehabilitation of disabled soldiers.
China Needs Schools
In a nation of four and a half
million population, only 72,000 per
sons are registered at colleges, uni
versities, and technical schools. Dr.
Wu quoted figures to illustrate her
premise that:
"We need more educated people."
Even during the war years there
has been progress and expansion,
however, and a substantial increase
in school enrollment has resulted
mainly because of the push it has
been given by the National Govern
ment, she added. Compulsory edu
cation in primary school has been
advocated, also, but cannot be put
into practical application until the
war is over.
Education for Women
Because of the high cost of edu
cation and because they lead busy
home lives, many Chinese women
cannot attend school, Dr. Wu said,
and only 20 per cent of the college
students are women.

"But," she emphasized, "the edu
cated person is always respected in
China," and she expressed the wish
that women would have a larger
share in her country's educational
program after the war.
Youth More Mature?
Were Chinese college students
more mature than American col
lege men and women?
"Young people are young people
everywhere," Dr. Wu smiled, but
on the whole China youth seems
more concerned with current issues.
This is only natural, she commented,
since on the national side they are
confronted with the pressing prob
lems of war, and on the personal
side they know college is a limited
privilege and therefore are appreci
ative and appear to "get more out
of it."
Language Barriers
As for exchange education pro
grams between the United iSates
and China, Dr. Wu explained that
language is and will continue to be
a barrier until enough professors
are traded by the two nations to
teach students each others' lan
guages. Americans who can speak
Chinese will be needed in China
in postwar years to help the people
learn and understand the United
States.
A great future is predicted by Dr.
Wu for republican China, with in
dustrial expansion and moderniza
tion as its mainstays. Comprehen
sive programs have been planned by
the National Government to develop
the water power of the Yangtze-
Gorges region, textile manufactur
ing, and other industries; much of
this being under the capable direc
tion of the minister of foreign af
fairs, Wong Wen-hai, according to
Dr. Wu.
Faith for the Future
Dr. Wu appeared to have the faith
in her country characteristic of the
Chinese leaders, and a courage
which has marked her recent years
as head of a college in war-torn
China. Ginling College has been
moved to the campus of West China
Union University in Chengtu. along
with four other colleges established
in refugee quarters.
During the war Dr. Wu has been
closely associated with the develop
ment of the national organization
of Chinese Women for War Relief
. . . she is an outstanding leader in
every field she enters.

war . . . for women are doing their
part."
She listed ways in which Chinese
women help the war's progress
which parallel many of the things
which American women are doing
today: Working in hospitals, doing
clerical work for the Armed Forces,
gathering gifts for soldiers "to com
fort and cheer," and aiding in the
rehabilitation of disabled soldiers.
China Needs Schools
In a nation of four and a half
million population, only 72,000 per
sons are registered at colleges, uni
versities, and technical schools. Dr.
Wu quoted figures to illustrate her
premise that:
"We need more educated people."
Even during the war years there
has been progress and expansion,
however, and a substantial increase
in school enrollment has resulted
mainly because of the push it has
been given by the National Govern
ment, she added. Compulsory edu
cation in primary school has been
advocated, also, but cannot be put
into practical application until the
war is over.
Education for Women
Because of the high cost of edu
cation and because they lead busy
home lives, many Chinese women
cannot attend school, Dr. Wu said,
and only 20 per cent of the college
students are women.

"But," she emphasized, "the edu
cated person is always respected in
China," and she expressed the wish
that women would have a larger
share in her country's educational
program after the war.
Youth More Mature?
Were Chinese college students
more mature than American col
lege men and women?
"Young people are young people
everywhere," Dr. Wu smiled, but
on the whole China youth seems
more concerned with current issues.
This is only natural, she commented,
since on the national side they are
confronted with the pressing prob
lems of war, and on the personal
side they know college is a limited
privilege and therefore are appreci
ative and appear to "get more out
of it."
Language Barriers
As for exchange education pro
grams between the United iSates
and China, Dr. Wu explained that
language is and will continue to be
a barrier until enough professors
are traded by the two nations to
teach students each others' lan
guages. Americans who can speak
Chinese will be needed in China
in postwar years to help the people
learn and understand the United
States.
A great future is predicted by Dr.
Wu for republican China, with in
dustrial expansion and moderniza
tion as its mainstays. Comprehen
sive programs have been planned by
the National Government to develop
the water power of the Yangtze-
Gorges region, textile manufactur
ing, and other industries; much of
this being under the capable direc
tion of the minister of foreign af
fairs, Wong Wen-hai, according to
Dr. Wu.
Faith for the Future
Dr. Wu appeared to have the faith
in her country characteristic of the
Chinese leaders, and a courage
which has marked her recent years
as head of a college in war-torn
China. Ginling College has been
moved to the campus of West China
Union University in Chengtu. along
with four other colleges established
in refugee quarters.
During the war Dr. Wu has been
closely associated with the develop
ment of the national organization
of Chinese Women for War Relief
. . . she is an outstanding leader in
every field she enters.

Education for Women
Because of the high cost of edu
cation and because they lead busy
home lives, many Chinese women
cannot attend school, Dr. Wu said,
and only 20 per cent of the college
students are women.

"But," she emphasized, "the edu
cated person is always respected in
China," and she expressed the wish
that women would have a larger
share in her country's educational
program after the war.
Youth More Mature?
Were Chinese college students
more mature than American col
lege men and women?
"Young people are young people
everywhere," Dr. Wu smiled, but
on the whole China youth seems
more concerned with current issues.
This is only natural, she commented,
since on the national side they are
confronted with the pressing prob
lems of war, and on the personal
side they know college is a limited
privilege and therefore are appreci
ative and appear to "get more out
of it."
Language Barriers
As for exchange education pro
grams between the United iSates
and China, Dr. Wu explained that
language is and will continue to be
a barrier until enough professors
are traded by the two nations to
teach students each others' lan
guages. Americans who can speak
Chinese will be needed in China
in postwar years to help the people
learn and understand the United
States.
A great future is predicted by Dr.
Wu for republican China, with in
dustrial expansion and moderniza
tion as its mainstays. Comprehen
sive programs have been planned by
the National Government to develop
the water power of the Yangtze-
Gorges region, textile manufactur
ing, and other industries; much of
this being under the capable direc
tion of the minister of foreign af
fairs, Wong Wen-hai, according to
Dr. Wu.
Faith for the Future
Dr. Wu appeared to have the faith
in her country characteristic of the
Chinese leaders, and a courage
which has marked her recent years
as head of a college in war-torn
China. Ginling College has been
moved to the campus of West China
Union University in Chengtu. along
with four other colleges established
in refugee quarters.
During the war Dr. Wu has been
closely associated with the develop
ment of the national organization
of Chinese Women for War Relief
. . . she is an outstanding leader in
every field she enters.
