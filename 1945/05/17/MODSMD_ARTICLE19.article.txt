# Foot, Parliamentary Secretary, describes Economic War Duties
## 
### ELLEN MARCUS 
To all students of Poli Sei 20
(MTWThF 8), the name of Dingle
Mackintosh Foot has a familiar ring;
for this delegate to the UNCIO i.s
Dr. Philip Buck's favorite example
of a member of Parliament and a
member of British ministry. These
students also know that Mr. Foot
and Dr. Buck were at Oxford Uni
versity together and that they both
d( hated in the Oxford Union.
According to Dr. Buck, Foot
joined the Liberal Party while a
student at Oxford, as the Union is
divided into parties in the same way
as is Parliament. He was elected to
Parliament in IC3I and became Par
liamentary Secretary to (he Ministry
of Economic Warfare in 1940. As
Dr. Buck pointed out, Foot would
not have been appointed to the
ministry if there had not been a
coalition government, as the Liberal
Party has not been in power since
Lloyd George's last administration.
Back of the Enemy
Mr. Foot described the duties of
the ministry of economic warfare in
an interview given The Daily by
saying that "it is concerned with
everything behind ihe enemies'
lines." During the war with Ger
many, the department "administered
the naval blockade, cut out supplies
that went to Germany through neu
tral countries, and advised bombers
as to which targets to attack . . .
it is a clearing house for all under
ground information working in con
junction with the United Stales em
bassy in London."
Mr. Foot stressed the fact that
"the London and Washington gov
ernments work as one organization
. . . pooling all their information.
The same methods will be kept up
in pursuing Ihe war with Japan."
To questions aliout Britain's
part in the Japanese war, Foot

said, "The English people are as
interested in victory over Japan
as are the American people. Of
course, we tended to look at the
nearest war first . . . especially
when it was on our own doorstep.
But we have a long reckoning to
| settle with Japan ourselves . . .
Hong Kong, Rangoon, New Gui
nea. We have employed many
; troops against the Japanese and
they hold thousands of British
prisoners.
"There is now a large British force
engaged in Burma and Rangoon and
the British Fleet is in operation with
the American Fleet against Japan.
In the last war, as more of our
forces became engaged in the Far
East, our interest was naturally in
creased . . . and I assure you, it
will increase even more."
| Conference Okay
In regard to the Conference, Mr.
Foot thinks "it is straightening out
fairly quickly . .. but we must re
member that there are 47 different
views present and hundreds of
amendments to be considered. The
main difficulty is that this Confer
ence took place after only a few
weeks of preparation whereas most
conferences are prepared over a pe
riod of months. The United States
Government and the City of San
j Fflhncisco have done a masterpiece
I of organization."
Dismay Over Poland
When asked his opinions on re
gional organizations. Mr. Foot said,
"There is no reason why there
shouldn't be regional organizations
as long as they aren't an alternative
to world organization. If a world or
ganization is to function at all. re
gional organizations must be in a
secondary position. We are not in
Ihe least bit against them . . . in
fact, wo are all for them as lomj

as they work in conjunction with
the world organization."
Mr. Foot, was very dismayed at
(he turn which the Polish problem
has taken, and explained Britain's
position by saying that "we couldn't
possibly admit the Lublin govern
ment as it is now constituted, We
have no doubts that the 10 impris
oned Polish leaders represent a
large section of the Polish people
. . . but even more must be repre
sented in the final government."
"The British government is fully
cognizant of the Polish situation as
we have had Poles in London for
over five years. They have served
with our army, navy, and air forces
and their leaders, under the Lon
don government, have played a con
siderable part in the war. Having
been associated with them for so
long, we naturally are extremely
interested in the final outcome."
Buck—"Foot Intelligent"
Mr. Foot's position as a Parlia
mentary secretary corresponds to
the position of undersecretary in
our government; but it holds a
double responsibility as Parliamen
tary secretaries must sit in Parlia
ment as well as being junior min
isters.
Dr. Buck said he suspects Foot
will stay with the Liberal Party
after the war, and if it should be
revived as Sir William Beveridge
is trying to do. Foot will go far
in the ministry as he is "a very
serious minded and effective speak
er and a very intelligent adminis
trator."

In regard to the Conference, Mr.
Foot thinks "it is straightening out
fairly quickly . .. but we must re
member that there are 47 different
views present and hundreds of
amendments to be considered. The
main difficulty is that this Confer
ence took place after only a few
weeks of preparation whereas most
conferences are prepared over a pe
riod of months. The United States
Government and the City of San
j Fflhncisco have done a masterpiece
I of organization."

When asked his opinions on re
gional organizations. Mr. Foot said,
"There is no reason why there
shouldn't be regional organizations
as long as they aren't an alternative
to world organization. If a world or
ganization is to function at all. re
gional organizations must be in a
secondary position. We are not in
Ihe least bit against them . . . in
fact, wo are all for them as lomj

as they work in conjunction with
the world organization."
Mr. Foot, was very dismayed at
(he turn which the Polish problem
has taken, and explained Britain's
position by saying that "we couldn't
possibly admit the Lublin govern
ment as it is now constituted, We
have no doubts that the 10 impris
oned Polish leaders represent a
large section of the Polish people
. . . but even more must be repre
sented in the final government."
"The British government is fully
cognizant of the Polish situation as
we have had Poles in London for
over five years. They have served
with our army, navy, and air forces
and their leaders, under the Lon
don government, have played a con
siderable part in the war. Having
been associated with them for so
long, we naturally are extremely
interested in the final outcome."
Buck—"Foot Intelligent"
Mr. Foot's position as a Parlia
mentary secretary corresponds to
the position of undersecretary in
our government; but it holds a
double responsibility as Parliamen
tary secretaries must sit in Parlia
ment as well as being junior min
isters.
Dr. Buck said he suspects Foot
will stay with the Liberal Party
after the war, and if it should be
revived as Sir William Beveridge
is trying to do. Foot will go far
in the ministry as he is "a very
serious minded and effective speak
er and a very intelligent adminis
trator."
To all students of Poli Sei 20
(MTWThF 8), the name of Dingle
Mackintosh Foot has a familiar ring;
for this delegate to the UNCIO i.s
Dr. Philip Buck's favorite example
of a member of Parliament and a
member of British ministry. These
students also know that Mr. Foot
and Dr. Buck were at Oxford Uni
versity together and that they both
d( hated in the Oxford Union.
According to Dr. Buck, Foot
joined the Liberal Party while a
student at Oxford, as the Union is
divided into parties in the same way
as is Parliament. He was elected to
Parliament in IC3I and became Par
liamentary Secretary to (he Ministry
of Economic Warfare in 1940. As
Dr. Buck pointed out, Foot would
not have been appointed to the
ministry if there had not been a
coalition government, as the Liberal
Party has not been in power since
Lloyd George's last administration.
Back of the Enemy
Mr. Foot described the duties of
the ministry of economic warfare in
an interview given The Daily by
saying that "it is concerned with
everything behind ihe enemies'
lines." During the war with Ger
many, the department "administered
the naval blockade, cut out supplies
that went to Germany through neu
tral countries, and advised bombers
as to which targets to attack . . .
it is a clearing house for all under
ground information working in con
junction with the United Stales em
bassy in London."
Mr. Foot stressed the fact that
"the London and Washington gov
ernments work as one organization
. . . pooling all their information.
The same methods will be kept up
in pursuing Ihe war with Japan."
To questions aliout Britain's
part in the Japanese war, Foot

said, "The English people are as
interested in victory over Japan
as are the American people. Of
course, we tended to look at the
nearest war first . . . especially
when it was on our own doorstep.
But we have a long reckoning to
| settle with Japan ourselves . . .

"There is now a large British force

the American Fleet against Japan.
In the last war, as more of our
forces became engaged in the Far
East, our interest was naturally in
creased . . . and I assure you, it

To all students of Poli Sei 20
(MTWThF 8), the name of Dingle
Mackintosh Foot has a familiar ring;
for this delegate to the UNCIO i.s
Dr. Philip Buck's favorite example
of a member of Parliament and a
member of British ministry. These
students also know that Mr. Foot
and Dr. Buck were at Oxford Uni
versity together and that they both
d( hated in the Oxford Union.
According to Dr. Buck, Foot
joined the Liberal Party while a
student at Oxford, as the Union is
divided into parties in the same way
as is Parliament. He was elected to
Parliament in IC3I and became Par
liamentary Secretary to (he Ministry
of Economic Warfare in 1940. As
Dr. Buck pointed out, Foot would
not have been appointed to the
ministry if there had not been a
coalition government, as the Liberal
Party has not been in power since
Lloyd George's last administration.
Back of the Enemy
Mr. Foot described the duties of
the ministry of economic warfare in
an interview given The Daily by
saying that "it is concerned with
everything behind ihe enemies'
lines." During the war with Ger
many, the department "administered
the naval blockade, cut out supplies
that went to Germany through neu
tral countries, and advised bombers
as to which targets to attack . . .
it is a clearing house for all under
ground information working in con
junction with the United Stales em
bassy in London."
Mr. Foot stressed the fact that
"the London and Washington gov
ernments work as one organization
. . . pooling all their information.
The same methods will be kept up
in pursuing Ihe war with Japan."
To questions aliout Britain's
part in the Japanese war, Foot

said, "The English people are as
interested in victory over Japan
as are the American people. Of
course, we tended to look at the
nearest war first . . . especially
when it was on our own doorstep.
But we have a long reckoning to
| settle with Japan ourselves . . .
Hong Kong, Rangoon, New Gui
nea. We have employed many
; troops against the Japanese and
they hold thousands of British
prisoners.
"There is now a large British force
engaged in Burma and Rangoon and
the British Fleet is in operation with
the American Fleet against Japan.
In the last war, as more of our
forces became engaged in the Far
East, our interest was naturally in
creased . . . and I assure you, it
will increase even more."
| Conference Okay
In regard to the Conference, Mr.
Foot thinks "it is straightening out
fairly quickly . .. but we must re
member that there are 47 different
views present and hundreds of
amendments to be considered. The
main difficulty is that this Confer
ence took place after only a few
weeks of preparation whereas most
conferences are prepared over a pe
riod of months. The United States
Government and the City of San
j Fflhncisco have done a masterpiece
I of organization."
Dismay Over Poland
When asked his opinions on re
gional organizations. Mr. Foot said,
"There is no reason why there
shouldn't be regional organizations
as long as they aren't an alternative
to world organization. If a world or
ganization is to function at all. re
gional organizations must be in a
secondary position. We are not in
Ihe least bit against them . . . in
fact, wo are all for them as lomj

as they work in conjunction with
the world organization."
Mr. Foot, was very dismayed at
(he turn which the Polish problem
has taken, and explained Britain's
position by saying that "we couldn't
possibly admit the Lublin govern
ment as it is now constituted, We
have no doubts that the 10 impris
oned Polish leaders represent a
large section of the Polish people
. . . but even more must be repre
sented in the final government."
"The British government is fully
cognizant of the Polish situation as
we have had Poles in London for
over five years. They have served
with our army, navy, and air forces
and their leaders, under the Lon
don government, have played a con
siderable part in the war. Having
been associated with them for so
long, we naturally are extremely
interested in the final outcome."
Buck—"Foot Intelligent"
Mr. Foot's position as a Parlia
mentary secretary corresponds to
the position of undersecretary in
our government; but it holds a
double responsibility as Parliamen
tary secretaries must sit in Parlia
ment as well as being junior min
isters.
Dr. Buck said he suspects Foot
will stay with the Liberal Party
after the war, and if it should be
revived as Sir William Beveridge
is trying to do. Foot will go far
in the ministry as he is "a very
serious minded and effective speak
er and a very intelligent adminis
trator."
