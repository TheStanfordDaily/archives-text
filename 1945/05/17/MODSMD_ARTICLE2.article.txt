"They were amazed that Stanford
existed as one unit," said Avey
Quinn, Hurlburt House, when de
scribing how she and Anne Robin
son, also of Hurlburt, took Colom
bian delegates on a tour of the
campus last Sunday.
The delegates were Luis Eduardo
Nicto-Arteta, chief in the Depart
ment of International Institutions of
the Colombian foreign office; Abel
Borteta, secretary to the Colombian
embassy in London; and Jose Joa
quin Gori, counselor to the Colom
bian embassy in Mexico City and
secretary general of the delegation;
and Mrs. Gori.
The delegates said that univer
sities in Madrid, Bogota, and Mex
ico were scattered over the cities
by colleges, and that professors
often lived miles from the schools.
They approved of the Stanford
system of grouping the entire
University in one area, and of the
opportunity that students have for
contact with their professors.
Miss Quinn and Miss Robinson
took the delegates around Quad and
to the Chapel and the Hoover War
Library, where they met Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur and were taken to
the tower and later saw documents
from the Hague, Crimean, Locarno,
and Chapultepec conferences.
The delegates showed great in
terest in student life, added Miss
Robinson. "They wanted to know
where we lived, how we ate, and
what the tuition was." They also
were especially interested in Stan
ford's philosophy department, said
Miss Quinn.
Increase in correspondence be
tween United States and Latin-
American students was advocated
by all the delegates, said Miss
Quinn, adding that they thought
students of the Americas should
learn each other's languages and
customs to increase a greater feel
ing of unity between this country
and its Latin-American neighbors.
