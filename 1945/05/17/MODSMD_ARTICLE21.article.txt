# Machado Talks of Regional Security, Argentine Issue
## 
### ELLEN MARCUS 
"I believe it was a very good mea
sure for the United States to invite j
Argentina to the Conference as she
has given evidenee of fulfilling her
obligations and the stipulations laid
down at Chapultepec," stated Dr. 1
Alfredo Maehado-Hcrnandez, dele
gate from Venezuela to the UNCIO.
"Argentina has declared war on
the Axis and her presence at San
Francisco will insure hemispheric
solidarity. I do not think that she
is fascistic," he continued.
Soils at Stanford
Dr. Machado, father of Stanford
students Alfredo and Guillermo
Machado, is one of the four Vene
zuelan delegates representing their
country at the San Francisco Con
ference. He is director of the Cen
tral Bank of Venezuela and served
his government as minister of fi
nance from 1941 till 1943. He was
also minister to Lima in 1938 at the
time of the Bth Pan-American Con
ference and is vice-president of the
new University City in Caracas, the
capital of Venezuela.
To queries about Stanford, he re
plied that he "always knew Stan
ford was a wonderful university,
but not as good as I have actually
found it to be." Dr. Machado be
lieves Stanford is "an ideal center
for studies," and also added, "I am
very glad and satisfied that I sent
my sons there. I hope that my third
son will follow them in due time."
San Francisco Tops
As to San Francisco, he remarked
that it was one of the nicest cities
he has ever visited and that Golden
Gate Park is the most beautiful and
unique city park in the world.
Returning to the subject of the
Conference, Dr. Machado said he
was sure a formula will be found to
the "regional security" question now
under discussion. He believes chat
"the Pan-American organization
should be apillar to the world or
ganization, and that the former
should have full power during the
transitional period until the moment
when the world organization can
undertake the activities that are
now in the scope of the Pan-Ameri
can organization. In accordance
with regulations, measures dealing
with peaceful proceedings, such as
conciliation and arbitration, should
go to the Pan-American organiza

tion first, as should all matters of
primary interest to the American
nations."
More Assembly Power
In discussing the power of the
Assembly versus the power of the
Security Council as laid down by
the Dumbarton Oaks proposals, Dr. j
Machado stated that Venezuela had
proposed that there be a general en
largement of the Assembly's powers
in order to make the world organi
zation more democratic. It has also
proposed that the small powers rep
resentation on the Security Council i
should be slightly increased, but that â– 
the Security Council members
should be of a limited number.
"Geographical consideration should 1
be taken into account in assigning j
seats on the Security Council," said
Dr. Machado, "and distribution
should be among all nations ac
cording to the same principles car
ried through in the League of Na
tions."
Free Education
Education in Venezuela is entirely
free and the colleges are open to \
the whole population. Dr. Machado |
remarked. Since 193(5, the amount of
students desiring higher education
has greatly increased, necessitating
I that the government build many
new schools.
He emphasized the fact that the
government would step up its build
ing program even more as there are
still not enough facilities to accom
modate all; and that there are edu
cational opportunities :"or everyone
in Venezuela as it is one of the
most democratic countries in South
America. Even during the vcign of
the dictator. Juan Vincente Gomez,
who died in 193G, when there was
no political democracy, there was
still social democracy and opportun
ity.
New University City
Dr. Machado was very enthusias
tic about the new University City
that the government is building in
Caracas and the modernization of
the existing buildings. He said that
the architecture, organization, and
administration "oilow ihe American
methods, but the European system
of studies is still used. A Stanford
j alumnus and very close friend of

Dr. Machado's, Dr. Pedro Aguerre
vere, was a member of the comniis
sion that laid out the plans for the
new engineering department.
Dr. Muchiido was counselor for
President Medina Angarita of Vene
zuela and one of the authors of the
new oil law regulating the refining
of Venezuelan oil and increasing the
taxes on it. Pie explained that "it
is for the benefit of the Venezuel
an and foreign oil companies and
for the world. The idea is to open
new oil camps and fields and to di
vide the concessions between the
interested oil companies." He added
i that the companies will now be pay
| ing taxes that are just and that they
' seem to be well satisfied with the
new law as they have all asked for
i new concessions.
Dr. Machado is now working on
the fourth commission of the Con
ference which is concerned with
judicial organization and the Inter
national Court of World Peace. His
son, Alfredo Machado-Gomez, who
is in the Graduate School of Busi
ness Administration, is also a mem
j ber of the Venezuelan delegation
I and is serving on the second com-
I mittee of the first commission which
| is concerning with membership and
I ceneral regulations.
