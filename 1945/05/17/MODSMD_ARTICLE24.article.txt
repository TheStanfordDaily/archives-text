### KEN SCHUG 
"Molotov comes out of a setting utterly isolated from the arithmetic
of democracy as demonstrated at San Francisco," stated Charles Hodges at
the Palo Alto Forum Monday evening. The speaker, talking on "Person
alities at the San Francisco Conference," explained that the Russian dele
gation leader had never had experience in an international conference in

which countries like Costa Rica anrd
Guatemala would have the same
vote as the USSR.
This new experience, said the
speaker, may account for the disre
gard which Molotov showed for the
smaller nations in pressing his de
mands. This situation is one ex
ample of the effect of individual per
sonality on the outcome of the
United Nations Conference, Mr.
Ilodges pointed out.
Eden, Stettinius Experienced
Eden and Stettinius, said the
speaker, came to the Conference
with a different working basis, and
were therefore not surprised by this
international democracy. Ede"n has
had experience in similar gatherings
during his diplomatic career, and
Stettinius in presiding over stormy
steel stockholders' meetings, ex
plained Mr. Hodges.
Mr. Hodges said that the French
and Chinese have played waiting
games at the Conference, adding

that the Chinese are the most per
sistent politicians in the world.
Others Problems
Outside of this central core of the
five great powers, the speaker
stated, are all of the other countries
of the United Nations, many of
which present very complex and
delicate diplomatic problems. After
illustrating this point with some
confidential gossip, Mr. Hodges
praised the hospitality of San Fran
cisco and the Bay region, stating
that "social amenities are very im
portant in the Conference," serving
as an "insulator" to delegates from
foreign countries. He commented
here on the modern minds and Eng
lish speech of the Arabian sheiks,
who are not here merely to add
color to the meeting.
The third group of personalities
at the Conference, said the speaker,
are the "ghosts" from countries and
peoples not represented at the Con
ference, who are here to keep the
names of their nations in the minds
of the press and delegates alike. The
outstanding "ghosts" are those from
India, reported Mr. Hodges, who
with Mrs. Pandit at their head have
done much to "glamorize and per
sonalize the question of India." The
Indians, as well as "ghosts" from Li
thuania, Latvia, Poland, Korea, and
other countries, make their presence
known by asking questions in the
press conferences of the leaders of
the "Big Five" delegations, he ex
plained.
Compares Conference to Car
In concluding his talk, Mr. Hodges
compared the organization which
will come out of San Francisco with
an automobile. He stated that the
League of Nations machinery was
capable of success and that wc failed
"because wc and. other peoples in
the world believed that with a new
engine, gas tank filled, and starter
working wc could start rolling down
the international highway." How
ever, emphasized the speaker, "our
attitudes did not permit sane, safe
driving."
Mr. Hodges warned against the
idea that wc can avert trouble by
letting the powerful nations domi
nate the international organization,
and added that disagreement among
the United Nations would destroy
the organization. He finished by
saying that we in the United States
cannot be content to let the leaders
do the work, but must assume indi
vidual responsibility to avert the
horrors of a third world war within
the next generation.
