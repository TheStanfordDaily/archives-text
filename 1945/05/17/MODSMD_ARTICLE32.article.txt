# Chalet To Give ‘Darktown Ball’
## 
### 
A genuine "dark-town strutters'
ball" will be held at The Chalet Sat
urday night from 9 to 12, when the
interior of the house is converted, by
the use of phosphorescent murals
and a surrealistic streetlight, into an
imitation dark-town, and the hos
tesseses smear their faces with
grease paint to become darky danc
ers.
The entire campus is invited to
the dance, which will feature El
wood Hart's band from San Jose.
The theme will be carried out by
all who join the hostesses in wear
ing costumes, and by the little black
boys who servo punch and cookies
to the guests.
