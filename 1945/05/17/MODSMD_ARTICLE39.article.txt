### KEN SCHUG 
The people of the world are keenly interested in the San Francisco Con
ference, said Dr. D. Elton Trueblood in a speech on "Men und Ideas Behind
the San Francisco Conference," before a meeting of college religious groups
last Sunday night. There is a danger, however, he continued, in that pub
lic opinion is not yet fully organized to carry out this desire for peace. He

►•pointed out that verified atrocity
stories have made us all aware of
the horrors caused by war.
Dr. Trueblood slated that the
Conference has been very well plan
ned and that there has been a suc
cessful blending of "ancient vision
and present possibility." He added
that many young idealists from the
student Christian movements have
had a chance to implement their
idealism in a practical way at the
Conference.
Consultants Praised
The speaker praised the work of
the group of 75 consultants repre
senting labor, fraternal societies,
churches, patriotic organizations and
other national groups, who meet
daily under Archibald MacLeish,
Librarian of Congress, and poet.
Among these consultants is Walter
White, president of the NAACP, Na
tional Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People, who is con
vinced that we should not forget
Africa or any of the submerged peo
ples of the world, said Dr. True
blood. He added that the proposal
for international trusteeship is the
only solution to the problem of em
pire, but added that we in America
can't throw stones at other empires
if we remember how we stole Amer
ica 'rom the Indians.
Molotov has stolen the show, said
the speaker, as the most colorful
delegate and the person receiving
(lie most attention. A lawyer from
South Russia, the Soviet Foreign
Commissar adopted the name Molo
tov, which means "of the sledge
hammer," when he joined the Bol
sheviks before the first war, related
Dr. Trueblood.
Secretary of Slate Stettinius, the
speaker thought, has done a compe
tent job as head of the United States
delegation, an d has made no bad
mistakes, although he is not especi
ally colorful.
Dr. Trueblood concluded by say
ing that so far the Conference has
not failed, and nobody has gone
home mad. He reported that the ro
tating chairman plan has worked out
well and that there is a general con
viction that the Russians are really
desirous of a successful conclusion
to the Conference.
