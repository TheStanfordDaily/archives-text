# Lady Luck: Daily Writer Interviews Stettinius, Eden
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Lady Luck is no piker. Once she's
chosen the time, the place, and the
person, she can put on a wonderful
show.
Lady Luck put her mark on Daily
reporter Ellen Marcus Thursday and
Friday, when she went to San Fran
cisco to explore the news possibili
ties of the United Nations Confer
ence. Armed with a notebook, an
enterprising nature, and an appoint
ment with Dr. Alfredo Machado, our
reporter was catapulted into inter
views with Anthony Eden, Edward
Stettinius, Harold Stassen, Tom
Connally, and many other Confer
ence notables.
All Starts 011 Tuesday
It started on Tuesday. At the
British Information Service Office
she was informed by press relations
head Archie Mackenzie that Mr.
Eden might give a press conference
the next day, and warned by him
not to tell other newsmen since it
was indefinite. Recalling his words,
she said, "I still don't know who he
thought I was going to tell."
At Dinule Macintosh Foot's office
at the Mark Hopkins, she asked for
a brief appointment for sometime
later in the week, was almost caught
off guard when his secretary said,
"Mr. Foot will sec you now!" The
few minutes Ellon was granted with
Mr. Foot stretched into a quarter
hour, twenty minutes, and they
were suddenly talking about Stan
ford. and Dr. Philip Buck and Poli
Sci 20.
\ Follows Press Men
At the Fairmont, the Daily report
er noticed a swarm of rod-badged
newsmen being Tunneled through
the entrance to the Solarium—she
followed. Although a blanket rul
ing against college reporters exists
for regular press conferences, OWI
man James O'Sullivan admitted El
len to the background, strictly ofT
thc - record conference that John
Foster Dulles was at that moment
beginning in the Solarium.
The rest of the afternoon was
spent in arranging appointments and
prospects for interviews with the
American and British delegates. Our
reporter met Charles Eaton, Repub
lican Congressman from New Jer
sey; and Connally's assistant, Mr,
Shirley, who was responsible for
some of the magic wrought on Fri
day's trip.
Con ley Goes Too
Former Daily business manager
Bill Conley, a camera, flash bulbs,
and car key in his hand, was wait
ing for Ellen the next morning at
the Cellar. He had heard of her pos
sible interview with Eden, and was
determined to photograph it. After
phoning Mackenzie and Stettinius'
secretary, and being told that ar
rangements had been made for them
to have interviews with both. Ellen
and Conley raced for the car—still
i not believing their luck.
Eden's press conference was to
begin at noon, and at a quarter to
twelve the car began to smoke and
spurt steam. Disappointed but loyal
to his car, Conley pulled into a serv
ice station for repairs. Anxious that
Ellen should not miss her chance at
the interview, he flagged down the
first car that appeared, persuaded its
driber to take her to the city.
Attends Press Conference
Layers of tables with chairs on
1 top supplemented the 25 rows of
J chairs arrayed for Eden's confer
! ence, and the remnants of the 1800
press representatives attending were
crowded for many feet around the
doorways. Ellen edged through
rows of reporters until she could see

Eden. From all over the room came
the names Lippman, Kaltenborn,
Upton Close, as the newsmen identi
fied themseb'cs before asking ques
tions.
Dashing from the press confer
ence to the Fairmont, the Daily re
porter was joined by Conley, cam
era in hand. Together they went to
a background conference in the Red
Room, admitted by Mr. Shirley, at
which Commander Stassen and Sen
ator Connally were speaking. As
Ellen spoke with Stassen, Conley
stood on a chair and took the picture
printed inside.
Connally Makes Statement
Said Connally, "There will be no
trouble in the Senate about ratify
ing the charter for international or
ganization. Bretton Woods — there
will be trouble in getting it through
the Senate, but I apprehend it will
be passed."
Next on Ellen's list of adventures
was her admission to the suite of
Sol Bloom, who was sitting in a
dressing - gown, surrounded by
stacks of papers.
Her interview with Bloom was cut
short when her wrist-watch an
nounced that she was due at Stas
sen's office. "Although some dele
gates want a definition of 'aggres
sion,' I don't know if it will be
written into the charter," he said.
"The Security Council will judge
whether a certain act is a threat to
peace and security, but this docs not
mean that all nations will be denied
their inherent right of self defense."
It was not until Stassen had left
them at the elevator that Conley
realized he had neglected to remove
the shield from the camera when
photographing him and Ellen!
Seeing Eden Doubtful
Eden's secretary was doubtful as
to whether or not a personal inter
view could be obtained, but seeing
the disappointment of the two re
porters, he told them where Eden
could be seen at 6:30. Conley
frowned. "We have an appointment
with Stettinius at 0:30!"
Presently, Eden came out of his
office, after a session with Life pho
tographer Noel Kasch, and chatted
for a few moments with the two
students.
From the Mark Hopkins, the re
porters went to the Fairmont to see
Stettinius, whose secretary was
watching the door for signs of the
long-overdue Secretary of State.
Ellen and Conley, believing he had

been unable lo keep his brief ap
pointment with them, were about to
leave the office, but at the persua
sion of State Department men lin
gered around the elevator in hopes
of catching him en route to another
conference.
The two were settled in chairs,
Conley with his camera aimed, when
the door clanged open and out
walked Stettinius and a retinue of
officials. Ellen approached him,
identified herself, asked whether the
proposals of ihc United States or
Britain regarding trusteeships would
be accepted. He replied that he be
lieved most of the major U.S. pro
posals would be accepted.
As Stettinius and officials walked
away down the hall, whispers of,
"Who is she?" floated back to the
two students. And Ellen says, "What
docs it matter if they didn't know
who 112 was ... I got the inter
view."
With camera and notebooks piled
on the car scat, Ellen and Conley
began the long drive home—won
dering if their luck would hold the
car together all the way to Stanford.
