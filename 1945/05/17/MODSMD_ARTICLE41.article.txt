# Savelleâ€™s Topic To Be Spain
## 
### 
Dr. Max Savelle will discuss
"Spain's Place in the Postwar
World" today at 4:30 for the World
Affairs Group of the YWCA, an
nounced Esther Kelsy. co-chairman.
The talk touches upon one of the
most delicate situations in the world
of international affairs. As Dr. Sa
velle says,"The Franco government
is trying to win the respect of the
outside world but the prospects are
not very promising."
Dr. Savelle thinks that the gov
ernment probably does not have the
support of most of the Spanish peo
ple, and that both the republican
parties and the monarchists have
asked Franco to give up the govern
ment.
"The establishment of some gov
ernment more representative of the
people of Spain is a matter of con
siderable concern to the other na
tions," said Dr. Savelle.
He also believes that the appear
ance of a political crisis in Spain
may well precipitate a crisis in
world relations, and might become
a very serious test of the internaion
al organization now being planned
in San Francisco.
The discussion will be given in
the Y rooms of the Women's Club
house. Tea will be served at 4:15.
