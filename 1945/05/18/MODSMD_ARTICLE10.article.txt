### 
WASHINGTON, May 17 (UP).—
More than 1,000 members of the
crew of the aircraft carrier "Frank
lin" were killed or wounded on
March 19, the Navy disclosed today,
when a Jap dive-bomber scored two
direct hits that set off the ship's
entire load of explosives and turned
the flat-top into a floating; hell. But
the survivors of the heroic crew,
with dead arid dying at their feet,
kept afloat the 27,000-ton mass of
flaming, twisted wreckage and
brought her home from the scene of
the tragedy, only 60 miles off the
Japanese coast.
The casualty toll was the biggest
ever suffered by any American na
val vessel in a single engagement.
It included 341 dead. 431 missing,
and more than 300 wounded.
Now the charred and battered
hulk that once was a proud flagship
of Vice-Adm. Mark A. Mitscher's
Tokyo-busting task force has found
refuge in Brooklyn Navy Yard af
ter a 12,000-mile cruise, most of it
under her own power, from the
scene of her victorious fight for life.
Tokyo claimed that the "Frank
lin"—"Big Ben" as she was affec
tionately known to her crew—was
sunk on March 19.
