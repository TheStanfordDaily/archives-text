# Spain Topic Of Savelle Lecture

### GEORGE BRUNN 
"Spain, as Fascist as ever, is a
critical country in any considera
tion of international security," said
Dr. Max Savclle yesterday.
Speaking before the World Af
fairs group of the Y.W.C.A. he
maintained that if, through English
and American support, Franco were
to be admitted to the United Na
tions Conference it would disrupt
the Conference and split the Big
Three, for Russia would never sit
at the same table with a govern
ment that sent soldiers against her.
Franco Measures
The Franco government has re
cently taken measures designed to
make itself appear liberal to out
siders. It has broken relations with
Japan and Germany (on V-E Day),
it has freed political prisoners (all
except the "most dangerous"), it
has come out for freedom of the
press (but for foreign correspond
ents only), for freedom of speech
(except criticism of the principles
underlying the dictatorship), for
freedom of assembly ("for lawful
purposes"), and for freedom of wor
ship (but the Catholic church is the
only one the people can attend).
When the war broke out Franco
remained non-belligerent but very
friendly to the Axis. He aided the
Germans by shipping them vitally
needed wool, coal, iron and wolf
ram.
Income Source
We countered this by outbuying
the Nazis. As a result Franco grew
rich at our expense. However, this
unexpected source of income was
the most important factor in keep
ing him from actively engaging in
war against us. Had Germany con
trolled Spain it would have been
exceedingly difficult if not impos
sible for us to gain access to the
Mediterranean.
After we had occupied North Af-
Rica and invaded Italy we were in
a position to stop Franco from sup
plying Germany. By discontinuing
oil supplies to Spain, thus paralyzing
the country's economic life, we
forced Franco into strict neutrality.
Strength Declining
As soon as he saw that we were
winning the war he tried to become
friendly with us in order to get in
with the winning side. However,
Dr. Savelle explained, his strength
inside Spain has been steadily de
clining, as the church is becoming
suspicious of his policies, the aris
tocrats oppose his land reforms and
the industrialists his labor laws. At
present only 10-15 per cent of the
people support Franco. But he is
strongly backed by foreign capi
talists who are fearful of losing
their profits under a democratic
government.
Particularly strong are the Brit
ish, who control most of Spain's
mining, textile and steel industry,
and the Americans, who own the
telephone system and many of the
transportation facilities.
"Nevertheless," maintained Dr.
Savelle, "Franco cannot last much
longer." The government succeed
ing him is likely to be mildly so
cialistic, but there is little danger
of Communism.

Japan and Germany (on V-E Day),
it has freed political prisoners (all
except the "most dangerous"), it
has come out for freedom of the
press (but for foreign correspond
ents only), for freedom of speech
(except criticism of the principles
underlying the dictatorship), for
freedom of assembly ("for lawful
purposes"), and for freedom of wor
ship (but the Catholic church is the
only one the people can attend).
When the war broke out Franco
remained non-belligerent but very
friendly to the Axis. He aided the
Germans by shipping them vitally
needed wool, coal, iron and wolf
ram.
Income Source
We countered this by outbuying
the Nazis. As a result Franco grew
rich at our expense. However, this
unexpected source of income was
the most important factor in keep
ing him from actively engaging in
war against us. Had Germany con
trolled Spain it would have been
exceedingly difficult if not impos
sible for us to gain access to the
Mediterranean.
After we had occupied North Af-
Rica and invaded Italy we were in
a position to stop Franco from sup
plying Germany. By discontinuing
oil supplies to Spain, thus paralyzing
the country's economic life, we
forced Franco into strict neutrality.
Strength Declining
As soon as he saw that we were
winning the war he tried to become
friendly with us in order to get in
with the winning side. However,
Dr. Savelle explained, his strength
inside Spain has been steadily de
clining, as the church is becoming
suspicious of his policies, the aris
tocrats oppose his land reforms and
the industrialists his labor laws. At
present only 10-15 per cent of the
people support Franco. But he is
strongly backed by foreign capi
talists who are fearful of losing
their profits under a democratic
government.
Particularly strong are the Brit
ish, who control most of Spain's
mining, textile and steel industry,
and the Americans, who own the
telephone system and many of the
transportation facilities.
"Nevertheless," maintained Dr.
Savelle, "Franco cannot last much
longer." The government succeed
ing him is likely to be mildly so
cialistic, but there is little danger
of Communism.
"Spain, as Fascist as ever, is a
critical country in any considera
tion of international security," said
Dr. Max Savclle yesterday.
Speaking before the World Af
fairs group of the Y.W.C.A. he
maintained that if, through English
and American support, Franco were
to be admitted to the United Na
tions Conference it would disrupt
the Conference and split the Big
Three, for Russia would never sit
at the same table with a govern
ment that sent soldiers against her.
