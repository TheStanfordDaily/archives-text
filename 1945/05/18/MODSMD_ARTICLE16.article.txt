# Pinza Saves Evening with Voice; Songs, Presentation Disappoint
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
An Ezio Pinza who did not quite
live up to this reviewer's expec
tations, nevertheless did not seem
to disappoint an enthusiastic Con
cert Series audience in an almost
sold-out Memorial Auditorium last
night.
Prepared for (ho famous Pinza
smile and the famous Pinza per
sonality, this reviewer found little
evidence of either. But in spite of
a poor selection of songs, an ea
gerly receptive audience brought
the basso hack for eight curtain
calls and two encores at the end
of the recital.
Pinza, however, was not even up
to standard. Throughout most of the
concert one had the feeling that he
was bored, and his stage manner
more than once seemed patronizing
ly condescending.
The evening was saved, however,
by his beautiful voice, which was
enjoyed to best advantage if the
listener closed his eyes and did not
look at the stage.
The first number on his pro
gram was a Handel aria. "Caro
Sposo," from "Rinaldo." The basso
hardl.v warmed up to this one, and
the effort of (he plaintive, minor
melody of this song was marred
by a too rigid and precise de
livery. Pinza failed lo bring any
kind of the emotional quality of
this music to life.
He was accompanied by Gibner
King, whose piano in this number
was also rigid, and what feeling
there was in his playing was lost
behind the monotonous tone Pinza

maintained throughout almost all |
the song.
The second selection was an
other Handel aria. "Si tra i Ccp
pi." from "Berenice," and although
the melody of this piece was rcli- i
giously militant, the basso again
sang with a feeling of bored mo
notony.
He saved the first part of the con
cert with his third selection, the j
aria "Dormi. Amorc" from "La Flo
ra" by Dh Gagliano. This peacefully
wistful air from one of the very
early Italian operas was started by
a brief piano introduction which set
the keynote of soft, sad tenderness !
characteristic of the song .
I'in/a's voice throughout the
whole selection was beautifully

modulated, with the right amount
of dramatic feeling coupled with
a nice restrain which, taken all
together, sent the audience wildly
clapping at the end.
The basso seemed to feel the spirit
and plaintive mood of the song and
sang accordingly. Mr. Gibncr's
piano was outstanding here, and the
playing was characterized by the
same sensitivity to mood that made
the entire rendition almost the out
standing success of the evening.
Following this came two Pie
montcsc folk songs, the first of
which, '*11 Maritino," was gayly
humorous, fitting the customary
swashbuckling Pin/a style, and
giving the audience promise of
more to come. Pinza's stage per
sonality in this one improved
considerably, for, as in the pre
ceding Italian selection, he caught
the spirit of the song, literally tell
ing the amusing folk talc to the
audience with lively enjoyment.
But more did not follow. The
second part of the concert was com
posed of four French songs, only
one of which had good melody and
oression. This was "Au Pays," by
Holmes, which Pinza sang with fel
ing and understanding of the mili
tant, aggressive, and sad moods
which characterized the air.
The rest of the concert consisted
of five songs in English, none of
which was outstandingly successful,
and three Italian songs and an aria.
The latter were somewhat better
done, but none were familiar, and
none had the quality necessary to
bring Pinza's voice to its highest
possibilities.

modulated, with the right amount
of dramatic feeling coupled with
a nice restrain which, taken all
together, sent the audience wildly
clapping at the end.
The basso seemed to feel the spirit
and plaintive mood of the song and
sang accordingly. Mr. Gibncr's
piano was outstanding here, and the
playing was characterized by the
same sensitivity to mood that made
the entire rendition almost the out
standing success of the evening.
Following this came two Pie
montcsc folk songs, the first of
which, '*11 Maritino," was gayly
humorous, fitting the customary
swashbuckling Pin/a style, and
giving the audience promise of
more to come. Pinza's stage per
sonality in this one improved
considerably, for, as in the pre
ceding Italian selection, he caught
the spirit of the song, literally tell
ing the amusing folk talc to the
audience with lively enjoyment.
But more did not follow. The
second part of the concert was com
posed of four French songs, only
one of which had good melody and
oression. This was "Au Pays," by
Holmes, which Pinza sang with fel
ing and understanding of the mili
tant, aggressive, and sad moods
which characterized the air.
The rest of the concert consisted
of five songs in English, none of
which was outstandingly successful,
and three Italian songs and an aria.
The latter were somewhat better
done, but none were familiar, and
none had the quality necessary to
bring Pinza's voice to its highest
possibilities.


EZIO PINZA
An Ezio Pinza who did not quite
live up to this reviewer's expec
tations, nevertheless did not seem
to disappoint an enthusiastic Con
cert Series audience in an almost
sold-out Memorial Auditorium last
night.
Prepared for (ho famous Pinza
smile and the famous Pinza per
sonality, this reviewer found little
evidence of either. But in spite of
a poor selection of songs, an ea
gerly receptive audience brought
the basso hack for eight curtain
calls and two encores at the end
of the recital.
Pinza, however, was not even up
to standard. Throughout most of the
concert one had the feeling that he
was bored, and his stage manner
more than once seemed patronizing
ly condescending.
The evening was saved, however,
by his beautiful voice, which was
enjoyed to best advantage if the
listener closed his eyes and did not
look at the stage.
The first number on his pro
gram was a Handel aria. "Caro
Sposo," from "Rinaldo." The basso
hardl.v warmed up to this one, and
the effort of (he plaintive, minor
melody of this song was marred
by a too rigid and precise de
livery. Pinza failed lo bring any
kind of the emotional quality of
this music to life.
He was accompanied by Gibner
King, whose piano in this number
was also rigid, and what feeling
there was in his playing was lost
behind the monotonous tone Pinza

maintained throughout almost all |
the song.
The second selection was an
other Handel aria. "Si tra i Ccp
pi." from "Berenice," and although
the melody of this piece was rcli- i
giously militant, the basso again
sang with a feeling of bored mo
notony.
He saved the first part of the con
cert with his third selection, the j
aria "Dormi. Amorc" from "La Flo
ra" by Dh Gagliano. This peacefully
wistful air from one of the very
early Italian operas was started by
a brief piano introduction which set
the keynote of soft, sad tenderness !
characteristic of the song .
I'in/a's voice throughout the
whole selection was beautifully

modulated, with the right amount
of dramatic feeling coupled with
a nice restrain which, taken all
together, sent the audience wildly
clapping at the end.
