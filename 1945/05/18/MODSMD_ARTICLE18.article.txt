# Van Patten Calls Library 'Human Being with Book'
## 
### 
Libraries with books numbering
close to ten million volumes, with
finer buildings and more complex
systems, should not lose sight of the
fact thai "a library after all is no
more than a human being with a
book," said Dr. Nathan Van Patten,
director of the University Libraries,
at the American Studies Symposium
yesterday afternoon.
Libraries in the sixteenth and sev
enteenth centuries in American
homes were small, usually owning
a Bible, some religious and utility
books, but these were read and re
read. In contrast to our modern
institutional and public libraries,
these earlier collections, large and
small, were free from censorship.
Gradual Change
The transition from private to
public libraries was gradual, having
as forerunner the proprietary and
| subscription, or circulating library.
I Benjamin Franklin's Library Com
uany of Philadelnhia, established in
1731, was probably the first sub
scription library.
The most; notable proprietary li
brary, which is still in existence,
was the Boston Aathcnaeum which
offered the advantages of a private
collection with the increased facili
ties of a large one.
The handling of books through
school districts, tried in New York
State in 1835, failed because the
books "notoriously disappeared,"
which, as Dr. Van Patten said,
"books always do."
Deterrents
Dr. Van Patten outlined the two
detrimental effects of our public li
brary system which began when
professional librarians introduced
the mumbo-jumbo of library sci
ence and when the idea of the beau
tiful building to house the books was
put into effect.
Dr. Van Patten related a personal
experience with an old professor
who complained that public libra
ries. newly instituted on the cam
pus where he taught, lacked three
essential things. One could not get
dust on one's hands, or put one's
feet np on a table and feel at home,
and the new library kept regular
hours.
Another detrimental effect was
I that on the author and publisher.
! Books which formerly had to be
j purchased to be read could now
be borrowed by fifty or 100 people.
I This brought on the unpleasant re
sult of librarians trying to build up
circulation and publishers trying to
popularize books.
I.ess Money
The decrease in remuneration to
i the publisher and author made the
modern author seek another source

of income from his book: the mo
tion picture. Dr. Van Patten cited
"Gone with the Wind" as the book
which started this trend.
