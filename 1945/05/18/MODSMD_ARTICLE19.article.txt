# Spring Sing Entries Are Due Today
## 
### 
Today is the final day to register
for the Spring Sing, according to
Chairman Martha Austin. Groups
who have been practicing their se
lections, but who have not signed
up, are urged to do .so at the ASSU
office before 5 p.m. or their efforts
will have been in vain.
A 50 cent fee is payable at the
time of registration.
The ban on musical instruments
for the Sing has been partially
lifted after discussion between Miss
Austin and Dr. D. Sterling Wheel
wright. Any non-band instruments
—aecordian, ukulele, guitar — may
be used, but a group will be dis
qualified if the instrument takes the
lead, rather than the choral arrange
ment.
Only 12 groups have signed up so
far, as compared with the last year's
total of 27. The Sing will be held
in the Frost Memorial Amphitheater
on June 1.
Trophies will be awarded to the
best men's, women's, and graduate
group. Ric Supple will serve as
emcee.
