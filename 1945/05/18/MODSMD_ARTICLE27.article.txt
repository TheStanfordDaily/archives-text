# France Is Subject Of Debate
## Cal, Stanford Groups To Meet Here May 23 
### 
The Medaillc Joffre, donated by
Lc Baron Pierre de Coubertin in
1895 that it "might direct the at
tention of students to the efforts
which the French people are mak
ing in the cause of progress," is
again the goal of three Cal and a
trio of Stanford debaters May 23.
Cal and Stanford enter the second
half-century of competition for the
coveted medal in an effort to break
the 25 to 25 tie piled up since the
first contest in the little chapel on
the Inner Quad April 12, 1895.
French Problems
The discussion of contemporary
French problems is particularly per
tinent this year as San Francisco
delegations ponder the problem of
reconstructed Fiance and her place
in the post-war era. The Alliancc
Frangaise, continuing the custom of
the French government, will pre
sent the 1945 medal to the individual
speaker judged best on the basis of
"excellence of reasoning, scholar
ship, style and delivery."
Verbal Tussle
Each year Cal and Stanford alter
nate as hosts to carry out the origi
nal plan of Le Baron Pierre de Cou
bertin. and the May 23 verbal tussln
will be held in Memorial Audito
rium.
The Baron endowed the contest ill
1894 "in remembrance of his visit
and the kindly spirit toward France
he found on the Pacific Coast," ac
cording to the Stanford "Daily Palo
Alto" of that year. He had listened
to a debate between teams of the
two universities and was impressed
by the interest shown.
Stanford Won First
Richard L. Sandwick of Stanford
became the first medal winner, -and
interest between the two University
rivals ran high. As many as forty
aspirants turned out to compete for
a place on the team and a special
train was chartered to bring stu
dents from Berkeley for the clash.
Audiences ran up to 2500 and
cheered for their respective teams
as they walked onto the stage.
The Joffre Debate has had Bay
Region interest for half a century
because it. has a dramatic quality
which no other debate at Stanford,
except the Oxford debates, has been
able to duplicate.
