Even before the delegates of the United Na
tions have finished their work on machinery for
the preservation of world peace, we hear the
ominous rumblings of future war drums. We
should realize that preservation of peace de
pends on more than the outcome of the debates
nnd discussions of the world's leaders, and
that our present international actions must be
judged in the light of future world security;
that we should not allow the results of our tem
porary emotions to add fuel to the bonfire of
future international conflagration.
An example of the decisions made during
times of stress which are invariably :egretted
tv/enty years later is the announcement by
Herbert Lehman, Director General of the United
Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administra
tion, that UNRRA has no authority and no in
tention of feeding the German people. This
decision by the United Nations should give
reason for despair among people who have
hoped that a better world' might arise from the
chaos of the past decade.
Recent reports from Europe indicate that the
German people have not been exempt from
the horrors of war. Malcolm Bingay, editorial
director of the Detroit Free Press, who has just
returned from a trip through Europe, says "20
to 50 million homeless people wander along
the roadways, famished and diseased." The
people of Germany are already disillusioned
and broken in spirit; starvation and retribution
can only increase the despair and hopeless
ness in the hearts and minds of 80,000,000
people.
Allied leaders have expressed the hope that
a democratic and peace-loving Germany will
be able to emerge slowly from the ruins of a
crushed nation; this hope will grow ever dim
mer as the staivation list of German civilians
mounts because of the refusal of the victors to
provide food to fill the empty larders of Ger
many. We must not extinguish the sputtering
sparks of freedom with a stream of hatred and
revenge; we must not let our moral indignation
cloud our vision of the new world of freedom
and justice promised by the much-abused At
lantic Charter; we must find a way for all men
of good will in Germany and throughout the
world to use their efforts in the stupendous job
of trying to preserve the world from the horrors
of future conflict.—Ken Schug
