### PEGGY FITTS 
SING A SONGFULL
What's happened to the Spring Sing?
Some of us are old enough (get away, little
man!) to remember this vernal festival when
the sign-ups, if laid end to end, would have
reached from the Cellar to the Libe, which is
easily the most formidable hunk of distance on
campus. And when the lucky parties who
v/alked away the gold cup used to think nothing
of chiseling out a glass case for the same and
burning cigarettes in front of it. And when
that damp and dreamy evening of ear-exercise
in the wide-open spaces of Frost Memorial was
one of the best features of the guarter, the one
everybody wanted to get in on. Now how old
does that make us anyway?
Look, everybody, the Listening Room Only

sign isn't out yet. There's still lots of space
on the singers' side; you can see it plainly in
between the little pink pitch-pipes. (Does any
of you girls sing baritone?)
Stanford likes to sing. Come on out in the
open, Stanford, where we can all hear.
