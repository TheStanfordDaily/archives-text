American nnd British disagreement with Russia is
becoming increasingly evident in post-war Europe.
During recent months the Russians have installed
Communist or socialistic regimes in the various coun
tries occupied by Soviet armies. The Baltic countries,
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, have been made a part
of the Soviet Union, while Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria,
and possibly Czechoslovakia have established govern
ments very much under direct or indirect Russian in
fluence.
In Yugoslavia, Marshal Tito's forces are very friend
ly to Russia and likely wish to establish a Communist
regime. General Von Paulus and a group of Russian
generals have been used by the Russians to incite an
insurrection in the German army and because of their
assistance may be given considerable authority in the
government of Soviet-occupied areas.
These men would not be unfavorable to a socialist
or Communist German government and essentially a
close alliance with the Soviet Union.
First real evidence of British-American opposition
to the influence of the Soviets in Europe was in Greece,
where the Partisans attempted to overthrow the Brit
ish-sponsored government. These so-called rebels were
mostly from the socialistic and communistic elements,
and very possibly had the secret blessing of the Rus
sians.
YALTA DIFFICULTIES
At Yalta it was apparently agreed among the Allies
to establish a compromise government in Poland com
posed of elements from the Polish Exile government
in London and elements from the Polish Communist
party.
Unfortunately for Allied unity the Russians set up
their own government composed chiefly of men favor
able to Polish-Russian co-operation, excluding the con
servative Exile group.
For weeks this question has been argued by heads
of the Allied governments but not satisfactory agree
ment has been reached; and now it is becoming very
obvious that Russia intends to have its way in Poland
regardless of consequences. The break in Allied unity
became more serious when the Russians arrested 16
members of the exiled Polish regime for an alleged
conspiracy against the Soviet army.
Despite British-American attempts to alter the
trend, the Socialist and Communist parties have been
increasing in strength in all parts of Europe where
elections are being held. In Belgium and France the
Socialists in particular have won mst of the political
offices. Of more importance, General De Gaulle made
a pact of mutual assistance with Russia and has in
many ways indicated his partiality toward the Soviet
Union. In Italy also radical elements are becoming
increasingly more influential.
TRIESTE OCCUPATION
This week a dispute between Yugoslavia and Eng
land has developed over the problem of the occupa
tion of Trieste. Marshal Tito's forces occupied the city
illegally, and now the British have sent a formidable
battle fleet into the harbor to exert pressure upon the
Yugoslavs. The British undoubtedly do not want
Marshal Tito with his pro-Russian sympathies to be
come too powerful.
Most important of all, the British hint that Admiral
Doenitz and the present German surrender govern
ment may be left in power under Allied military con
trol. Furthermore German generals are not being
treated unkindly by either the Americans or British;
hence it seems the old policy of balance of power.
The British especially seem not to want an impotent
Germany, as they feel that this country despite its evil
tendencies must serve as a bulwark against the spread
of Russian influence. Altogether the prospects for
postwar Europe are not too bright unless the Allies
make a greater effort to co-operate and to forget sus
picious differences.

The British especially seem not to want an impotent
Germany, as they feel that this country despite its evil
tendencies must serve as a bulwark against the spread
of Russian influence. Altogether the prospects for
postwar Europe are not too bright unless the Allies
make a greater effort to co-operate and to forget sus
picious differences.
American nnd British disagreement with Russia is
becoming increasingly evident in post-war Europe.
During recent months the Russians have installed
Communist or socialistic regimes in the various coun
tries occupied by Soviet armies. The Baltic countries,
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, have been made a part
of the Soviet Union, while Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria,
and possibly Czechoslovakia have established govern
ments very much under direct or indirect Russian in
fluence.
In Yugoslavia, Marshal Tito's forces are very friend
ly to Russia and likely wish to establish a Communist
regime. General Von Paulus and a group of Russian
generals have been used by the Russians to incite an
insurrection in the German army and because of their
assistance may be given considerable authority in the
government of Soviet-occupied areas.
These men would not be unfavorable to a socialist
or Communist German government and essentially a
close alliance with the Soviet Union.
First real evidence of British-American opposition
to the influence of the Soviets in Europe was in Greece,
where the Partisans attempted to overthrow the Brit
ish-sponsored government. These so-called rebels were
mostly from the socialistic and communistic elements,
and very possibly had the secret blessing of the Rus
sians.
YALTA DIFFICULTIES
At Yalta it was apparently agreed among the Allies
to establish a compromise government in Poland com
posed of elements from the Polish Exile government
in London and elements from the Polish Communist
party.
Unfortunately for Allied unity the Russians set up
their own government composed chiefly of men favor
able to Polish-Russian co-operation, excluding the con
servative Exile group.
For weeks this question has been argued by heads
of the Allied governments but not satisfactory agree
ment has been reached; and now it is becoming very
obvious that Russia intends to have its way in Poland
regardless of consequences. The break in Allied unity
became more serious when the Russians arrested 16
members of the exiled Polish regime for an alleged
conspiracy against the Soviet army.
Despite British-American attempts to alter the
trend, the Socialist and Communist parties have been
increasing in strength in all parts of Europe where
elections are being held. In Belgium and France the
Socialists in particular have won mst of the political
offices. Of more importance, General De Gaulle made
a pact of mutual assistance with Russia and has in
many ways indicated his partiality toward the Soviet
Union. In Italy also radical elements are becoming
increasingly more influential.
TRIESTE OCCUPATION
This week a dispute between Yugoslavia and Eng
land has developed over the problem of the occupa
tion of Trieste. Marshal Tito's forces occupied the city
illegally, and now the British have sent a formidable
battle fleet into the harbor to exert pressure upon the
Yugoslavs. The British undoubtedly do not want
Marshal Tito with his pro-Russian sympathies to be
come too powerful.
Most important of all, the British hint that Admiral
Doenitz and the present German surrender govern
ment may be left in power under Allied military con
trol. Furthermore German generals are not being
treated unkindly by either the Americans or British;
hence it seems the old policy of balance of power.
