To the Editor:
The fateful day is over;
The fateful deed is done.
The stoops who got low numbers
Are gloating as they come.
There are those luckless morons
Like me and thee and you,
Who drew the higher numbers.
Gawd! Do we feel blue!
We'll see you all in Russell,
In Storey and Chalet,
Ealing with thirty women,
Not two hundred every day.
We'll look at you with envy,
For we, you understand.
Are inmates of dear "Poplar,"
The bestest. in the land!
We tried for Mariposa,
And Lag and Redwoods, too;
But now we live in "Poplar";
What the hell are we to do?
There are a few who like it;
They can have the place, we say.
We'll try again next quarter
To move far, far away.
This is no ode triumphant;
This is no paean we sing;
For we're the dopes who suffer—
But for Stanford, anything!

To the Editor:
This is to protest ihe scurrilous attacks made upon
the one blotch of light and intelligence occasionally
permitted in your columns, the piece, "Seen from an
Ivory Tower," which I continue to read with renewed
pleasure and amazement to find it in a daily periodical,
in these days of "blunt and hard-headed thinking."
It is notorious at Stanford that there is no outlpt
whatsoever for literary work of more than passing
and unpretentious significance, and those who would
begrudge a lew lines occasionally to a thoughtful and
delightful column should be vigorously encouraged to
up the suicide rate for the vicinity.
