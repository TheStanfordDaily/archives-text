# Parent Quail Chirp Anxiously As Students Rescue Family from Sewer
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
A small group hovered over a
sewer near the Post Office. The
noon whistle blew, but no one
moved. Two firehouse men and a
couple of Lagunita women were
waiting for the rest of their seven
tiny children to be rescued.
One by one the baby quail were
being drawn gently back through
the cracks where they had fallen.
The rescuers knocked off for
lunch with three quail still trapped.
But at 1 p.m. a squad of hashers re
turned. Shortly afterward a corp

yard truck drew up, and three men
leaped out to pry loose the heavy
cover. It had taken two hours, but
every last quail was returned to its
parents.
