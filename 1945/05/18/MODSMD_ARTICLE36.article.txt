Her sisters attended Stanford also,
and. although her brother attend

Hospital.

After spending almost her entire
working career at Stanford, Miss
Elizabeth Kadden, associate librar
ian of the Stanford University Li
braries, will retire at the end of the
present school year.
Miss Iladden started her career
at the Palo Alto Library, and
then as a student assistant in the
main lihe while she was attending
Stanford, at a time when the work
included copying catalog cards by
hand and other jobs which have
since been taken over by more
modern methods.
Her next position was that of cat
aloger when she prepared cards for
cataloging and provided books with
shelf numbers.
In 1912 Miss Hadden was made
chief of the order division of the
Stanford University Library, a posi
tion which she held until she was
made associate librarian this year.
Miss Hadden's job for the most

part is detailed work behind the
scenes and is probably not heard
of by most students. The order
division of the library does not
come in contact with the students,
but handles all books and jour
nals which come into the library.
All gifts, requests for purchase,
and purchases come through the
division where they are checked
to. be sure that duplications are
not made. Providing books with
bookplates, pockets, due slips, and
numbers are all duties of the or
der division.
Miss Hadden said that, according
to a count recently made, over 500.-
000 books have passed through the
division since she has been with
them.
Another one of the jobs handled
by the order division is that of an
swering questions. Most questions go
to the reference room, but many
also come throueh Miss Hadden's

! department.
