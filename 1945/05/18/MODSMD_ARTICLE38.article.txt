# Med School Beats Phi Psi
## 
### 
Pounding across seven runs in the
fatal fifth inning, the Med School
whipped Phi Psi, 10-7, to remove
their last obstacle before battling
league-leading Monroe in the cham
pionship game next Tuesday. The
see-saw contest was a thriller from
start to finish, and for some time be
fore the fifth-frame outburst, Phi

Psi seemed headed for an upset win.
Med School scored once in the
first, but Phi Psi retaliated with
three runs in the third and singles
in the fourth and fifth to hold a 5-1
lead before the roof caved in. A
three-run triple by Benny Sugar
was the big blow for the Med School
in that tragic fifth.
Phi Psi tallied twice in the sixth
to pull the score up to 8-7, but a
two-run splurge by Med School in
the seventh iced the contest.
Meanwhile Monroe was waltzing
to their tenth win in eleven games
by smothering Buchanan, 13-2. The

Boozers scored at least once in ev
ery inning, while Joe Sher and Bob
Rosburg combined to hold Bu
chanan scoring to a minimum.
Tyler moved into sole possession
of fourth place by trouncing Ar
guello, 6-3, and the Flacs hoisted
themselves into a tie for seventh by
winning a forfeit decision from the
Legal Eagles, who have dropped
league play for the rest of the
season.
