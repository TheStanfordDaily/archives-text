Our exciting intramural season
will probably close next Tuesday
according to Harry Wolter, intra
mural baseball director. The pri
mary reason for this premature clos
ing is the fact that the Army has
challenged the Civilian league to an
all-star contest. The '"Daily's" all
star squad will soon be chosen and
it looks as if the first team will
be the one to tackle the Army ten.
Pitching chores will undoubtedly
go to either Joe Sher or Luke Pitts,
for there isn't another pitcher in
the league who can touch their
speed and control. This all-star
game, I repeal, should be good, and
well worth witnessing.
From all appearances, it would
seem as though Monroe had the
title cinched with only the Med
School squad standing in their path
to the championship. The "Boozers"
virtually eliminated the third place
Phi Psi aggregation from the race in
their 3-2 triumph last Tuesday.
The fourth place Tyler outfit was
exceedingly fortunate in defeating
Monroe in last week's encounter.
In spite of Monroe's Joe Sher and
their flawless infield which has made
only two or three errors all season,
they do have some weak spots, and
it was these that the "Hilltoppers"
capitalized on in their chance vic
tory.
