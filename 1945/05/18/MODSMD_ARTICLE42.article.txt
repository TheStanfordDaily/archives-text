# Stanford Men Enter Relays
## 
### 
Entering the Fresno Relays, the
outstanding Pacific Coast track
meet of the year, are Stanford stu
dents and alumni Ed Luce, Gordon
Levy, Emerson Hiler, Gordon Dunn,
Dick Northcraft, and Dick Vander
hoof. All of these men are out
standing in their respective* events
and all should place high.
Luce will probably meet his stif
fest competition of the year in the
high jump when he faces Dick Ho
meyer and Gil Green, of U.S.C.
fame. Up to this time, Luce has not
been beaten, but neither have these
two other jumpers. Last year Ho
meyer upset Luce in a very close
.contest.
Levy vs. Rhyne
In the 100-yard dash, Levy will
again face Rhyne of the Merchant
Marine, one of the oustanding
trackmen of the year, as well as
Frady of Caltech and Beman of
U.S.C. All three of these men have
hit 10 flat on their better days
and all three are competition run
ners. The one advantage that Levy
might have will be that the race is
on his old track, the same one in
which he won the high school dash
championship last year.
Rated as one of the best men on
the coast, Hiler should continue on
the victory road and remain unde
feated in the discus. However, he
will meet serious competition, es
pecially from Gordon Dunn, who
once was one of the best weight
men in the world.
Vanderhoof Enters
Thirteen feet, 6 in. is the best
height that Vanderhoof has reached
in the pole vault and that could be
just enough to win. So far this
year he hasn't had much chance to
practice though, so he might not be
in good enough shape to repeat
that performance.
In the javelin will be Northcraft
who has been able to get a little
practice and who has been improv
ing with every toss. However, the
competition will be very keen and
Northcraft will have to be at his
best to win.
