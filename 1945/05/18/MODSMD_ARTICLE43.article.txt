# Cellar Needs Men To Work Nights
## 
### 
The Cellar needs men to hash be
tween 9 and 11:30 p.m. Monday
through Thursday evenings.
Men need not necessarily work
the entire two and a half hours since
the working time depends only on
the type of job that is held.

EfTorts will be rewarded by the
gratitude of fellow students and
cash from the management.
For further information, call Alice
Tuttle at Lagunita.
