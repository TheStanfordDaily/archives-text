# Stadium Is Symbol Of Stanford Spirit
## 
### BOB PECK 
The green turf of the stadium is cut regularly. The track is nicely kept
and the seats are always clean. But there's something lonely about the
stadium that used to play host to 90,000 people. Maybe there are too many
memories associated with it.
When we walk near the stadium on warm afternoons we think we can

hear the roar of the crowds. If we
look up high enough we imagine
that we see the old Cardinal and
White Stanford banner tied to the
flagpoles. When the cheering gets
louder we wonder if it's Ernie Nev
ers, or Bobby Grayson, or Jimmy
Coffis who is thrilling the crowd.
Then the cheering quiets down. The
band is playing. Are they playing
"Come Join the Band" or "Sons of
the Stanford Red"? A big roar goes
up. Has Kmctovic scored? And all
of a sudden you wake up and it's all
over. The quiet is terrible and you
realize that there's nobody in the
stadium; it was just the Spirit of
Stanford crying out on a warm af
ternoon.
Empty Scats
We walk into the stadium itself.
The rows of empty seats give one a
sinking feeling. We look; over
where the Indian rooting section
used to sit and then up above the
rooting section to the Press Box.
Ernie Smith is up there broadcasting
the game all over the world; Bill
Leiser and Prescott Sullivan are
writing stories for their Sunday
newspapers. We wonder what the
banner head of tomorrow's paper
will be. Will it be "Stanford Upsets
Tiny Thornhill"? The typewriters
click furiously. Herbie Fleishhack
cr's run was great, wasn't it? But
we look down on the stadium floor.
There's nobody there. The grass is
too green; the stadium is too empty.
Indian Cheers
We walk down below the rooting
section to the point where the cheer
lenders used to stand. We turn
around surprised as we hear a "Go
On You Indian Team" chant. The
"Fight Fight Fight" cracks our ear
drums as it echoes back and forth
across the stadium. The rooting sec
tion across the way begins to yell.
Is it U.S.C. or Santa Clara? Their
band begins to play. Isn't that "Bow
Down to Washington"? And we see
the empty green turf. All of a sud
den the illusion has vanished too
quickly. The stadium is too ghastly
quiet. We go up steps to leave.
We can't stand it any longer. We
remember too much.
