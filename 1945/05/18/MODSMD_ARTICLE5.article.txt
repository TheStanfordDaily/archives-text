# UNCIO Stymied On Security Issue

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 17 (UP).
â€”The United Nations Conference
gave new evidence tonight of in
creasing progress in the big task of
drawing up a world security char
ter except in the troublesome re
gional security issue. Here they ap
parently were still stymied.
The hitch is that the Russian del
egation has not yet received instruc
tions from Moscow on what stand to
lake on the regional security issue
compromise.
By that agreement the Latin
American republics will yield to the
authority of the world security or
ganization. Previously they had
iield out for the superiority of the
inter-American security system in
disputes confined to the Western
Hemisphere.
