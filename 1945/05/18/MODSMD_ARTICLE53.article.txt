# 'Truman Faces Role of Party Leader And Spokesman for U.S.'---Barclay
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
That President Truman will occu
py a dual role in our governmental
system was affirmed recently by Dr.
Thomas S. Barclay, professor of po
litical science, in a recent interview
with the Daily.
"The President will be both
spokesmen of the United States in
many important affairs and leader of
the Democratic party," he declared,
adding that by assuming the presi
dential office, President Truman au
tomatically becomes the leader of
his party.
Conflicts Anticipated
In the field of politics, President
Truman may encounter many con
flicts, implied Dr. Barclay. "It would
appear that he will have the sup
port of both major parties in the
field of foreign policy," he said, "but
he will face many serious difficulties
in dealing with domestic affairs."
President Truman is also leader
of a political party that is badly
split in regard to many important
postwar issues, Dr. Barclay said,
adding that "he will also face de
termined opposition of many Repub
licans as his policies and program
develop."
Senate Background
In his relations with Congress,
and particularly the Senate, Presi

dent Truman has a background of
Senate service to help him. "The
fact that President Truman has the
regard and respect of most of his
former Senate colleagues can be a
very helpful factor in securing the
support of that body for the various
proposals which will come before it,"
declared Dr. Barclay.
But the Senate will not abstain
from "insisting upon exercising to
the fullest extent its powers" over
international affairs, Dr. Barclay
said. However, he added, the emerg
ing plans for postwar international
policy are "fairly clear in outline
form."
Support Needed
As a leader both in national and
international affairs, President Tru
man needs the support of the Amer
ican people. "With the support of
United States public opinion and

with the wealth and power of our
country," Dr. Barclay stated, "he
should be an effective spokesman of
our interests in relations with the
leaders of allied nations."
Much of President Truman's
success as a national leader, how
ever, will hinge on his own person
ality. "If he is a genuine and force
ful leader, Congress will be forced
to occupy a minor roleâ€”and will
resent its subordination," explained
Dr. Barclay.
Persuasion Politics
"The President, of course, has no
legal authority to force Congress
to any line of action," he added,
"so he must use the politics of per
suasion, depending on his influence
in controlling men and upon his
domination of the party organiza
tion. In other words, he must use
both his wits and his skill."
Concerning President Roosevelt's
famous New Deal, Dr. Barclay said
that "most of the policies embodied
in the New Deal legislation of 1933-
1938 will be continued under the
Truman administration."
Pressure Groups
"Those who anticipate or desire
Congressional domination of the
government should realize that such

domination leads to actual control
by selfish interests and by pressure
groups," Dr. Barclay concluded.
"The President is the only person
who can represent the country as a

whole, both in foreign affairs and
in domestic aflairs."
