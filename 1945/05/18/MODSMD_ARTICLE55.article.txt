# EXTRA QUADS SELLING FAST
## 
### 
There will be no more post office
sales of Quads, according to Pat
Ackerson, sales manager. Only 23
are remaining of the 200 extra ones
that were ordered. Any student who
wants to order one should come to
the Quad office during afternoons
as long as there are any left.
