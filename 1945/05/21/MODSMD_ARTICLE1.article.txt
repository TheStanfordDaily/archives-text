# Medieval Play Sets Used in Comic Opera
## 
### 
Colorful costumes and settings
based on the Medieval pageant
wagons have been worked out for
comic opera, "The Merry Wives
of Windsor," by Otto Nicolai which
will be given Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday nights on the main stage
of Memorial Auditorium.
The sets for this opera are usually
done in Elizabethan style but are
being done here in late Gothic style,
said Wendell Cole, technical direc
tor. The first two acts will have sets
like those used for the miracle and
mystery plays in the Middle Ages.
The set wagons will be moved in and
out during these acts and some of
the time there will be several sets
on the stage at one time. Some of
the scenes will be the Garter Inn,
the Ford house, Page house, and the
city of Windsor.
Wood Done Gothic Style
The Windsor wood done in late
Gothic style will be the scene of
the third act. It is typical of the
late Middle Ages in that there will
be trees with a ruined castle in the
background, Mr. Cole said.
The sets are painted in a "naive"
style, he said. He has designed the
sets, and six girls in Speech and
Drama 90 have built them. They are
Mary Martin, Helen Malley, Rober
ta Mattingly, Eugenia Mitchell, and
Betty Putnam.
Sixteenth Century Costumes
Costumes have been done in late
15th and early 16th century styles
bv Muriel Hopkins, Mary Higgins,
and Candy Taylor.
Choruses will be dresses in shades
of purple, aqua, and chartreuse. In
the third act, the bugs who pinch
Falstaft will be dressed in costumes
of these colors and glittering wings
and huge eyes added to them.
Anne Page wears a dress with a
train and glittering head dress and
hel lover will wear a turquoise robe.
Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford will wear
blue and red, and Falstaff will wear
a heavy red brocade robe with a
cape.
