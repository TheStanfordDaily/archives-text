CARDINALS TRYOUTS
A major difficulty facing the student body in
the past year has been to unify the large and
motley campus behind the traditional events.
Facing competition from the candle-burning-at
both-ends war-time pursuits, even Excom has
adopted a more or less formal policy of spread
ing out their official work throughout the entire
student body to maintain interest in the campus'
shaky war calendar.
The only way to promote anything at Stanford
is through people, and nobody knows this bet
ter than we do as day after day people expect us
to sell bonds, create audiences, manufacture
successful dances, promote spirit, inform, and
instruct, with the few choice words we can eke
into the space allotted to us.
In realizing their responsibility to promote
activities through the choice of people who
could carry their interest to the student body
at large, Cardinals has been seriously at fault.
Of Cardinals members, five men and five
women, four of the women live within the pro
verbial stone's throw, carrying the "enthusiasm"
Df activities council fourfold to approximately
200 people of the campus' 2600. The other
woman lives on the outskirts of the same area.
The men's living groups have no particular
organization, but three of the five men live
Dff-campus technically, while groups like Se
quoia and the veteran groups are struggling to
find out about things in the student body.
The evidences of this lack of foresight wrll
hamper Cardinals tryouts today and tomorrow
as few people will show up who ought to, be
cause hitherto it has been "no soap" for them.
Having no quarrel with Cardinals members
individually, we think they have not acted
conscientiously as a group in making replace
ments throughout the year, and hope they will
f ake advantage of their tryout period, today and
tomorrow, to make their organization an effec
tive one for next year's work.
