# FREE SPEECH
## 
### 
It is rather curious that a man should be
denied the right to speak in a city where dele
gates are trying to create an international or
ganization which would attempt to guarantee
freedom for all peoples. This happened last
Thursday to a man whose ideas happen to be
currently unpopular.
Gerald L. K. Smith, leader of the America
First party, self-proclaimed leader of American

nationalists, and advocate of the deportation
of negroes to Africa, had scheduled a talk in the
Mark Hopkins ball room for last Thursday eve
ning.
Thursday morning the hotel manager an
nounced that the meeting had been canceled,
although he did not say whether this decision
was his own or suggested by other groups in
terested in keeping Mr. Smith from speaking.
Regardless of the source of the cancellation
orders, the episode leaves a bad taste in the
mouths of us who accept the implications of
democratic freedom of speech. We do not be
lieve that free speech is the sole right of men
who want to express the views held by the ma
jority of the people or by their governmental
leaders; we do maintain, on the other hand, that
the test of a democratic society lies more in its
respect for minorities, than in its obedience to
the majority.
The right to express opinions should not be
denied to Mr. Smith despite his intolerance and
avowed purpose to denounce the San Francisco
Conference, because it indicates a fundamental
loss in faith in the democratic ideal. The stifling
of this speaker was at the least a stupid act,
since the publicity received because of this sup
pression will do more to increase the support of
his ideas than if he had been allowed to speak.
