Many students are asking when we shall fight Rus
sia. These questions imply a belief that we will have
to fight Russia. Even front line soldiers who have a
great admiration for the Soviet army are saying that
we must fight Russia in 10 or 15 years. Those who
favor Russian occupation of a large part of Germany
because of the Soviet Union's ability to deal with Nazis
still speak of the so-called Red menace in the con
quered territory.
Cooperation with Russia is essential for future
world peace. No real basis exists for differences be
tween the Western powers and Russia. Many pro
tests have been made about the so-called Soviet
sponsored leftist governments in Eastern Europe.
The United States, for instance, has protested the
establishment by Russia of a radical government in
Austria. In reality most of the men in the Austrian
coalition cabinet are comparatively conservative.
The Catholic Socialists represented in the Austrian
government, for example, were considered as the
first Fascists by Mussolini.
Much complaint has been heard about the Soviet -
sponsored Polish government; however that govern
ment. comprising communists and reformers, repre
sents the average Polish citizen far more than the
London Exile government which represents only the
aristocratic ultra-conservative landowning group.
Certainly the Fascist Argentine government does
not represent the wishes of the Argentine people any
more than the Soviet-sponsored Polish government,
and yet we invite Argentina to the United Nations
Conference and fail to invite Poland.
The League of Nations did not fail Because it lacked
the power to enforce peace but because the representa- j
lives of democracy sat at the same table with Fas
cists. Democrats can never deal with Fascists, and yet
in the present United Nations Conference under the
pressure of the South American nations we are deal
ing with Fascists. Cause for suspicion exists in that the
Fascist Spanish regime, under the blessing of many '
American and English big industrialists, may also be
invited to the Conference. Small wonder is it that
the Russians, who have the most cause to despise Fas
cism. look with some suspicion upon our good inten
tions.
In our press the Russian intentions have been re
ported with bias. During the opening days of the
Conference a certain notorious San Francisco news
paper printed many ill-advised editorials designed
to create suspicion of Russia.
In this paper a columnist has spoken of the so-called .
postwar Red threat in Europe. The whole tone of the
column has been designed to spread suspicion of Rus
sia. It is hardly possible that at least some of the
Russian delegates were not offended by the attitudes
expressed in the press.
If we sincerely believe that we have fought World
War II to make the world free from despotism and
war. we should make that belief evident. We should
try to'understand Russia and not attempt to spread
war psychosis by speaking of a World War 111 with
that country. Furthermore we should deal fairly
with this country, which certainly has not in reality
dealt unfairly with us. Instead of our customar>
vacillating foreign policy we should strive for once I
to have a definite and significant foreign policy. We [
can only have peace if we have the will for peace.
