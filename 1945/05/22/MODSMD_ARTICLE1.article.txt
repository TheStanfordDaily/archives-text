# Yost Stresses Unity

''We must keep from being 100
campus-minded because it makes us
near-sighted and provincial," Dean
Mary Yost said when speaking at
yesterday's meeting of Women's
Conference.
Miss Yost reported on the United
Women's Conference which she at
tended Saturday in the NBC Audi
torium in San Francisco. She
thought it remarkable that women
from varied backgrounds (from na
tions all over the world) all said the
same things—that if women wanted
things badly enough and all worked
together, they would get better
things.
Inspiring Poem
The San Francisco meeting was
opened by a very inspiring poem,
she said. It was written by an aver
age San Francisco woman and ex
pressed everything the Conference
brought out. Dr. Esther Brunauer, a
former Stanford woman and emi
nent woman historian, said that the

| future is ours only if we make it
' ours. ''We will have to work for it,"'
she said, "and it will take a great
! deal of spirit and character."
Another speaker brought out the
fact that one-half of all the people in
j the world are undernourished and
| that we will have to have social evo-
I lution to prevent political revolu
tion.
World Charter
Mrs. Vera Michelis Deane, a for
j eign relations expert and member of
j the Foreign Policy Association, said
we should get behind the San Fran
j cisco world organization charter not
I because it will be perfect but be-
I cause it will be nearly perfect and
j will need our support to make it a
| success.
All the speakers thought that
I women together can do what women
; separately cannot. Trained women
who are competent and wise are
| needed. Women could be a tremen
: dous force in the world.
