## 
### BEV FRENCH 
Amalia Millan, Mexican singer
and dancer, entertained a capacity
audience with her authentic folk
dances and native music at last
night's Hispanic World program.
Srta. Millan. wearing the color
ful costumes of the Indian tribes of
Mexico and accompanying herself
on the tom-tom and guitar, related
the story and the significance of
each of the dances and songs be
fore she performed it.
Tom-Tom
*'A majority of the native songs
and dances are accompanied by the
tom-tom," explained Srta. Millan.
"For the most part the Indians have
kept their primitive songs intact."
The songs, on the whole, were
brief, with no more than five dif
ferent notes. The natives do not
mind the monotony of the songs,
and during fiestas they will often
sing the same songs and perform the
same dances for several days at a
time.
Native Costumes
Srta. Millan explained that each
part of the native costume means
something. In one tribe a colorful
braid plaited in the hair means that
a woman desires to be married; in
another the amount of kerchiefs
worn about the neck indicates the
degree of aristocracy of the wearer.
An English commentary about the

Indian tribes was furnished by Dr.
Donald Winbigler, associate regis
! trar.

1 ten years visiting the native Indians

is composed of 125 Indians who live

west Mexico. These natives are in

meats and consists mainly of fish
washed up on the shore.

steps most of which are performed
with as little motion as possible.
