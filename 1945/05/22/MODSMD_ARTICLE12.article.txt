There seems to have been quite a flareup about Mar
shal Tito's rather unexpected entry into Corinthia and
Trieste, but now it has settled down, since Tito had
withdrawn his armies from the former.
The cause of the squabble was that Tito promised
these areas to international control until the peace con
ference, then moved into them suddenly on the pretext
that, "other members of the Allied nations have re
mained on the areas which they have liberated."
Tito, of course, was honest enough to admit that he
intended to "lodge formal claim to the areas at the
peace conference." But he still must realize that pos
sesion is nine points of what we like to call "interna
tional law."
America, but most especially Britain, lodged formal
protest about this affair. The main British vehemence
came through the C-in-C of the Allied armies in the
Mediterranean area, Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexan
der.
Sir Harold's statement made quite a flurry and the
contents of it are quite well known, the main effect
of them adding up to the undiplomatic but truthful
conclusion that the whole incident is reminiscent of
the going days of Fascism.
It is hardly doubtful that the Field Marshal made his
remarks without the full consent of not only the War
Office but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and thus
they were of great importance.
They are further significant because they came from
a soldier in command of armies that would make any
intervention if it came to a question of force. They
just as much as said. "Either get out. or I'll throw
you out."
Moscow was fully informed of the whole affair, and
of the agreements which Marshal Tito signed in good
faith, and violated in extremely bad faith. Stalin
therefore had no basis for supporting Tito, and the
Yugoslavian would-be dictators was isolated.
He drew back.
SIGNIFICANCE
The occupation of these areas might have been the
rash act of a not-too-intelligent man, or they might
have been an effort to gain bargaining points in re
gards to the Polish question. Tito would give up Car
inthia if his claims weren't acknowledged. If the

Polish leaders from London were left in jail and those
from Warsaw were allowed to take over.
If it were the latter, then the most that can be said
is that Moscow is not sure of itself. It throws Polish
leaders in jail but cringes from the question when it
is brought up. It makes half hearted diplomatic dives
only to climb out again when the water proves too
cold. It is engaged in a political sparring match.
Our reaction to its feelers has become stronger and
stronger. This is a policy apparently proven sound by
facts. The stronger the reaction, the quicker the feeler
draws back.
The net result of the feelers, therefore, is to give us,
not Russia, more bargaining power. We have shown
that we do not want trouble, because we have shifted
from a question of force as much as possible.
Therefore, Russia can trust us. We have also shown,
however, that we demand our rights, and therefore,
Russia must respect us. If she didn't she would have
simply turned her feelers into diplomatic battering
rams.
The combination puts Russia in the position of as
suming full responsibility for any haphazard and ill
considered moves she might make. Because we show
strength, we show that there will be consequences for
which to be responsible.
This is hardly an ideal situation, but it has promise.
There are two rational opponents in the political box
ing ring. One seems to be Russia, the other, the West
ern Allies.
So far each seems to be convinced that he can do
nothing but ward off the other's blow. Since they seem
to be rational, they might simply stop the boxing
sooner or later on the grounds that it is nothing but a
waste of energy that could be applied more profitably
in cooperation.

is brought up. It makes half hearted diplomatic dives
only to climb out again when the water proves too
cold. It is engaged in a political sparring match.
Our reaction to its feelers has become stronger and
stronger. This is a policy apparently proven sound by
facts. The stronger the reaction, the quicker the feeler
draws back.
The net result of the feelers, therefore, is to give us,
not Russia, more bargaining power. We have shown
that we do not want trouble, because we have shifted
from a question of force as much as possible.
Therefore, Russia can trust us. We have also shown,
however, that we demand our rights, and therefore,
Russia must respect us. If she didn't she would have
simply turned her feelers into diplomatic battering
rams.
The combination puts Russia in the position of as
suming full responsibility for any haphazard and ill
considered moves she might make. Because we show
strength, we show that there will be consequences for
which to be responsible.
This is hardly an ideal situation, but it has promise.
There are two rational opponents in the political box
ing ring. One seems to be Russia, the other, the West
ern Allies.
So far each seems to be convinced that he can do
nothing but ward off the other's blow. Since they seem
to be rational, they might simply stop the boxing
sooner or later on the grounds that it is nothing but a
waste of energy that could be applied more profitably
in cooperation.
There seems to have been quite a flareup about Mar
shal Tito's rather unexpected entry into Corinthia and
Trieste, but now it has settled down, since Tito had
withdrawn his armies from the former.
The cause of the squabble was that Tito promised
these areas to international control until the peace con
ference, then moved into them suddenly on the pretext
that, "other members of the Allied nations have re
mained on the areas which they have liberated."
Tito, of course, was honest enough to admit that he
intended to "lodge formal claim to the areas at the
peace conference." But he still must realize that pos
sesion is nine points of what we like to call "interna
tional law."
America, but most especially Britain, lodged formal
protest about this affair. The main British vehemence
came through the C-in-C of the Allied armies in the
Mediterranean area, Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexan
der.
Sir Harold's statement made quite a flurry and the
contents of it are quite well known, the main effect
of them adding up to the undiplomatic but truthful
conclusion that the whole incident is reminiscent of
the going days of Fascism.
It is hardly doubtful that the Field Marshal made his
remarks without the full consent of not only the War
Office but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and thus
they were of great importance.
They are further significant because they came from
a soldier in command of armies that would make any
intervention if it came to a question of force. They
just as much as said. "Either get out. or I'll throw
you out."
Moscow was fully informed of the whole affair, and
of the agreements which Marshal Tito signed in good
faith, and violated in extremely bad faith. Stalin
therefore had no basis for supporting Tito, and the
Yugoslavian would-be dictators was isolated.
He drew back.
SIGNIFICANCE
The occupation of these areas might have been the
rash act of a not-too-intelligent man, or they might
have been an effort to gain bargaining points in re
gards to the Polish question. Tito would give up Car
inthia if his claims weren't acknowledged. If the

Polish leaders from London were left in jail and those
from Warsaw were allowed to take over.
If it were the latter, then the most that can be said
is that Moscow is not sure of itself. It throws Polish
leaders in jail but cringes from the question when it
is brought up. It makes half hearted diplomatic dives
only to climb out again when the water proves too
cold. It is engaged in a political sparring match.
