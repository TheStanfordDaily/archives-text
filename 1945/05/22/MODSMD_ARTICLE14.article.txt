# Seen from an Ivory Tower

As the academic year of 1944-45 draws to an end, a
few seniors are on hand ready to graduate. It is the
time when those who for a year past have been fresh
men prepare to acquire the title as well as the intel
lectual attitude of the sophomore.
It is indeed no sudden transition, except in name.
Throughout the freshman year the change can be
traced and followed. The usual freshman is really only
worthy of that name during his first month at college.
During that time he is, primarily, a very wary bird.
Not knowing the ropes he is taking no chances.
That is the month which furnishes him with many
recollections for his later years. It is the month in
which, for the first time, he becomes acquainted with
the University and meets his class-mates, teachers and
officers of the Administration. Later on he may tell
many of them: "Do you remember when we first met?
I said so-and-so; you said such-and-such. We went
down to Paly for dinner. I thought you were a queer
duck!"
HE HITS TRADITIONS
It is the month in which he is made aware of the
traditions of Stanford and made to feel how they are
valued alike by the older students and by the faculty.
If this introduction to our traditions is done properly,
it creates an impression that is permanent in his mind
and that is only strengthened by his later experience.
If it is not done at all or done badly, it may set up
a feeling of reaction and antipathy that also will be
strengthened by later experience. For at 17 one gains
from experience what confirms the ideas already im
pressed upon the mind.
Life is too confusing for an inexperienced boy unless
he makes the most rapid arrangement of it that his
native wit can muster. Hence the positiveness of the
very young and their insistence on pushing principles
to an exasperating extreme.
But as the months pass by, adjustments are made.
Timidity at the unknown is replaced by a brash con
fidence as situations become more familiar. The Dean
of Men loses his portentous aspect and the little invi
tation cards to his office become more frequent as they
are treated more and more lightly.
SPONSOR GLORY FADES
The sponsors and the resident assistants are no long
er people to be placated because of the authority in
vested in them, but become "good Joes" or "bad eggs"
as the situation warrants, and safely disregarded in
either case.
The omniscience of the faculty and the omnipo
tence fo the Administration gradually disappear. The
limit of their tolerance is gauged with nice accuracy i
and actions are henceforth conducted on the border
region.
While Stanford in general respects its traditions, it
has little respect for its rules. Sons of the Western pio
neers, the cultural heritage begins to assert itself in
impatience at restraints and intolerance of administra
tion (student administration included). The forma
tion of the sophomore is well under way.
It is not a lovely period of a man's growth though it
is i very necessary one.
Even in those persons where it is most pronounced
and objectionable, however, it should be greeted with
welcome. Better far is the obstrtperous sophomore
than the timid, bookish boy who is never a problem.
He is the one about whom to be concerned, for some
day a situation may arise where his lack of maturity
con do more harm than ever was done by the impetu
ous. self-willed sophomore.
