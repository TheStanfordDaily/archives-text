# 'National Velvet' Makes Star of Elizabeth Taylor
## 
### 
''National Velvet" is the type of story that eould be turned into some
thing resembling a smelly piece of salt pork with the slightest bit of over
acting. It isn't done that way, though. The entire cast, and especially
Elizabeth Taylor, act with such natural sensitiveness that the plain story
turns into something almost beautiful.

Sincere Acting
Elizabeth Taylor plays the part of
a 12-year-old English girl who
loves horses above all else. The sin-

cerity of her act
? ing makes this
love seem per
fectly norm a 1.
There is none of
the affected Shir
ley Temple-Vir
ginia Weidler
"straight from
the back room"
touch to her.
Mickey Rooney

gives a good example of what he
can do with a straight dramatic
part. He takes the part of the little
tramp who helps Velvet Brown
(Taylor) train her horse for winning
the Grand National.
Ann Revere does a fine piece of
work as Velvet's mother, and Jack
ie Jenkins does his share of scene
stealing, with the same antics that
put him and his freckles over in
"The Human Comedy."
As if this isn't enough, the movie
is done in technicolor. This gives
the last touch toward making it 100
per cent natural.
Mystery Never Solved
The second feature now at the
Stanford is "I Love a Mystery."
Taken from the radio program of
the same name, written by Carlton
E. Morse, this movie gives some
thing a little different from the gen
eral run of bloody "also rans," in
that the mystery is never quite
solved.
It opens with the prophecy that
Jefferson Monk will be minus'a head
within three days. The three days
pass with a maximum of peg legs,
little men with satchels, and insan
ity; then, sure enough. Jefferson
loses his head.
We're left at the end with noth
ing more than an earless, eyeless,
noseless, and headless corpse in the
morgue, and a vague vision of a
one-legged man clumping off into
the fog with the better part of
Jefferson in his satchel.

within three days. The three days
pass with a maximum of peg legs,
little men with satchels, and insan
ity; then, sure enough. Jefferson
loses his head.
We're left at the end with noth
ing more than an earless, eyeless,
noseless, and headless corpse in the
morgue, and a vague vision of a
one-legged man clumping off into
the fog with the better part of
Jefferson in his satchel.
