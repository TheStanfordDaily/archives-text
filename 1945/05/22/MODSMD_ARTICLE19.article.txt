# Peace Feelers Denied by Japs
## 
### United Press 
United States troops on southern
Okinawa threw the Japanese baek
in all sectors Monday and drove re
lentlessly toward Shuri fortress
from three sides. Heavy fighting
raged along the entire five-mile
front in the fifty-second day of the
campaign. Japanese wearing United
States uniforms carried out futile
counterattacks. Suicide squads tried
to halt tank columns piercing Shu
ri's fortifications.
Japanese government spokesmen
meanwhile again denied reports of
Japanese "peace feelers" and an
nounced plans for increasing co-op
eration with a puppet government
in occupied China and mobilized 20
million students on a full war-time
basis for defense of the homeland.
The Japanese were unable to
stem the Chinese offensive in cen
tral China. The Chinese captured
the major enemy base of Hoehi in
Kwangsi province and practically
cleared the Min river shipping chan
nel from recaptured Foochow to the
east China coast, expanding their
hold on the invasion gateway to
Asia.
