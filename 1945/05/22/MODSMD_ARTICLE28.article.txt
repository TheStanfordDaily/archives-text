# Monroe Plays Medics Today
## 
### 
Murals are continuing 011 their
merry way, and Monroe is continu
ing to lead them. It seems as though
the Boozers are produ of their past
and are seeing to it that no one
takes their title away from them,
a title that they took last year and
have kept. However, the Medics,
who have lost only to the Boozers,
are getting a little tired of this con
tinued state of dominance and are
getting ready to take action.
Last Thursday they dumped Phi
Psi and tomorrow they hope to do
the same with Monroe. It will be
the same old battle of Joe Sher,
Bob Rosburg, and Ed Luce ,pitcher,
fielder, and hitter par-excellence,
against a fighting Medic squad led
by l 'Doc" Mason.
Hustling Club
Without a doubt one of the Med
ics' greatest asset is its fighting
spirit. The Phi Psi's found that out
last week, and Monroe might find
it out tomorrow. The odds are in
favor of the Boozers.
In another top-notch game, Tyler
faces the Flacks. Both of these
squads did not fare too well in the
first round, but have come back in
this round to be the giant-killers
of the league. With Bob Slobe, John
Glathe, Joe Pickering, and Denny
Fox leading the Hilltoppers, they
stand a good chance of winning.
The Flacks, with Bob Gettys and
A 1 Wolf are still powerful and any
thing can happen.
Buchanan vs. Arguello
Trying to break their losing
streak, the Buchanan Bearcats
come up against Arguello in the
only other game of the afternoon.
The Bearcats have not been playing
up to par lately and they will have
to get over their lethargy to win.
Arguello. with Tony Ortega, has
been constantly improving. Either
team can win.
