I For innumerable quarters, the
I Daily Sport Staff has been raving
j about the potentialities at Stanford.
! We have tried to show that there
j are many athletes on campus who
could make any Stanford student,
' past, present, or future, feel proud.
These athletes, although they realiz
ed that Stanford has officially ban
j ned inter-collegiate athletics for the
j emergency have gone out on their
J own and have kept the name of
| Stanford in sports circles; the least
jwe can do is acknowledge their
work and show our appreciation.
I
Do You Remember?
There are so many athletes that
we don't know where to start; that
is probably the reason why we al
ways bring up the Palo Alto Inde
pendents. Last quarter they put out
a basketball team that was one of
the most feared teams on the Coast;
last quarter they brought back the
spirit at Stanford. And this quarter,
| that spirit has carried on.
First of all, the Palo Alto Inde-
I pendents continued in baseball.
1 Their record was not great; their
i play was not spectacular; their will
was never beaten. That was probab
ly the only "team" Stanford had.
But that does not take into con
| sideration the individual stars in
all sports.
Track Stars Galore
Last Saturday at the Fresno Re
j lays five Stanford track stars en
tered and placed high in all events.
In fact. Ed Luce and Emerson Hil
er (who is a med student at San
Francisco) took first places against
a top field. They competed against
the best California had to offer, and
won. Our only regret is that Gor
, don Levy, who hurt himself the day
before the meet, couldn't enter.
When he won both dashes at the
U. C. meet last month, people
j thought it was a mistake and that
it couldn't happen again. We think
1 that Gordon can and will prove
that those races were not upsets.
And in tennis, we find that three
Stanford men have been outstanding
in the Bay Area. John Brock is
one of the best tennis players in
Northern California, as he so ably
proved in the Bay Counties Cham
pionship a short time ago. Brock
upset the sixth-seeded player in
: his initial encounter, and Gil Seton,
another Stanford student, fought his
way into the semi-finals of the Jun
ior division, before losing to second
seeded Matt Murphy.
Yes. Stanford still has athletes.
That is why its name is still feared
by all; that is why Stanford shall
never fall from the top.
