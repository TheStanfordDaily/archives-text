# Luce, Hiler Take Firsts
## 
### 
Proving to the Coast that the
California Invitational Meet last
month was not a fluke, five Stanford
men entered the Fresno Relays last
Saturday and came out with two
first places, two second places, and
one third place. To top this off, one
of Stanford's outstanding track men,
Gordon Levy, could not enter be
cause of a pulled ligament. Levy
was the boy who swept both dashes
at the U.C. meet and was given a
good chance to place high in the
Fresno meet. However, he pulled
up lame while running against some
Palo Alto stars last Friday and could
not enter the meet.
Luce Wins
Ed Luce, star high jumper, had
little trouble in taking that event.
It was against the stiffest competi
tion that he has met this year. He
did 6 feet 2 inches to take first
place. The other first placer was
Emerson Hiler, who has not been
beaten in the discus this year.
Without a doubt, Hiler is one of
the outstanding weight men in the
nation. He has consistently hit over
150 feet and has been improving
every meet.
Placing second in the javelin was
Dick Northcraft. Northcraft has
been able to practic? lately and is
also improving in every meet. The
same goes for Dick Vanderhoof,
who took a third in the pole vault.
Although he came nowhere near
the mark set by the "Flying Dutch
man,' he still did well for himself.
Hershey Places Second
One of the outstanding perform
ances of the day was made by A 1
Hershey, former Stanford weight
man. Hershey took second to Ear!
Audet of U.S.C. with a toss ol
50 feet 4 inches. A few years ago
he was very ill but he has recovered
and is just getting back into shape.
Great things are expected from hi:r
when he does fully recover.
