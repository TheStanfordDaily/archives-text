# Crisis at Trieste Eases
## No Fighting Yet in Italy 
### 
ROME, Wednesday, May 23 (UP).
â€”British troops and powerful Unit
ed States reinforcements made a
deep sweep into Italy's disputed Ve
nczia Giulia territory yesterday, oc
cupying a line running northward
to Trieste from a point five miles
east of Gorizia, it was revealed last
night.
Field Marshal Sir Harry Alexan
der, commander -in - chief of the
Mediterranean forces; General Mark
Clark; Lieut. General McCreary,
commanding the British Eighth
Army, and Lieut. General Geossrey,
commanding a powerful United
States corps, were in charge of the
situation on the spot.
The situation, in which Tito's
troops had occupied and insisted on
remaining in Italian territory, was
still delicate, and details of the sud
den change in the picture were
withheld temporarily including the
depth of the Allied penetration into
disputed territory. However, it is
possible to say that such a peaceful
penetration without incident was
believed to mean that the Trieste
crisis was dissolving at present.


Lieut. Gen. Mark W. Clark
