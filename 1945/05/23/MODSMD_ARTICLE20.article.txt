# Farm Debaters Are just Hoping 5
## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
Stanford's star trio at the Joffre
debate are all Mid-Westerners, and
with two actually from Missouri,
they are going to have to be shown
in every argument a determined Cal
can construct.
Sophomore Marshall Small and
Junior Mary Frances Westcott are
the two Missouri contributions to
Joffre discussion. Both likewise
share a pre-legal major and the
thrill of their first Joffre competi
tion.
Working Hard
V/ith a large card index under one
arm and a sheaf of papers in her
hand, Miss Westcott smiled when
she was asked her opinion about the
contest and said, "We've been work
ing hard to get our material in or
der, and we're just hoping now."
Reddish-haired Vicky Sellens will
be entering her second Joffre con
bat. Now a senior, she was also a
member of Stanford's Joffre team in
her freshman year, an unusual hon
or. After two years of debate vaca
tion, Miss Sellens is back again

training to meet Cal's best in the
Education auditorium, the only vet
eran Joffre debater on this year's
team.
From Kansas
Although out-talked by the two
Missourians when it comes to de
fending her home state of Kansas,
Miss Sellens is well able to hold
her own on Joffre foreign policy
questions. She has particular inter
est in the topic, since she intends to
graduate as a French major.
It v/ill be a repeat performance
when Marshall Small and Cal's Al
lan Jenkins oppose each other on
the stage of the auditorium tonight,
since they have already met in two
non-decision tussles. Juanita Olsen,
another Cal contestant, has also de
bated before a Stanford audience on
the universal military training ques
tion. *
Grateful to Coach
The three debaters, still busy with
last-minute preparations and prac
tice, were particularly grateful for
the untiring efforts of their coach,
Professor J. Gordon Emerson of the
Speech Department. "He has been
drilling us individually and given
us countless hours of help," said
Miss Sellens, as the Missouri duet
added their gratitude. The trio en
thusiastically agreed, too, on the
aid given by Dr. Arthur Bestor, Dr.
David Bassett, Dr. Ralph Lutz, Dr.
Albert Guerard Dr. Philip Buck,
and Dr. George Dowric.
