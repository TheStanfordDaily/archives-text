# Argentine Policy Right--—Rockefeller
## 
### MELLON SHELTON NANCY BANNICK 
The admission of Argentina to the
United Nations and to the San Fran
cisco Conference on International
Organization was not based on the
character of its government, but on
its relationship with other Latin-
American countries in helping the
war effort and ultimately in its in
terest in the peace effort, said Nel
son Rockefeller, Assistant Secretary
of State for Inter-American Affairs.
Rockefeller, former Co-ordinator
of Inter-American Affairs, spoke
before the weekly Press Club lunch
eon in San Francisco Sunday. The
supposed conflict between regional
arrangements and the proposed
world organization is not a conflict
at all, he declared.
Latin-Amcrican Union
"The presevration of the Latin-
American Union will only supple
ment the world organization," he
said, adding that it would not act
as a bloc to prevent a secure or
ganization for world peace.
"I feel that a regional association
based on democratic ideals has an
important part to play in the world
picture," he avowed. "The United
States will be stronger in the world
organization through its regional
unity.
"World and regional organization
are not mutually exclusive as goals,
but one complements the other. A
secure regional association can con
tribute to the success of world peace
and international organization."
Ecuadorian Envoy Spoke
Ecuadorian Ambassador Galo Pla
za placed emphasis on Rockefeller's
words. He said that Latin America

did not want regional unity just for
itself —but to complement the world
unity. The problem is to link it up.
Argentina's entrance to the Con
ference was not forced by Latin
America, Ambassador Plaza as
serted. The United States wanted to
invite Argentina, and both Latin
America and the United States
thought bringing Argentina in was
indispensable to world unity.
Governor Warren Spoke
Governor Earl Warren, one of the

first speakers on the luncheon pro
gram, told assembled high school
and college newspaper representa
tives of the contributions California
has made to the war effort and of
the problems it faces in post-war
industrial reconversion.
One and one-half million people
have migrated to California in the
past four years to work in war in
dustries, and it is expected that most
of them will stay after the war, he
said. They have done great work
and we will have to have jobs for
them to keep them here.
California Leads in Industry
"There is more industry in Cali
fornia than any state in the country
except for about three or four,"
Governor Warren affirmed, "but the
other states have permanent indus
try and we don't."
No other state has our resources,
he said. "We have minerals, petro
leum, farm products, good ports, and
a good climate. To solve our prob
lems, we need energy, foresight, de
termination, and character. It is up
to the youth of California."
Canadian Spoke
Canada's Dr. T. F. Newton, asso
ciate chairman of the United Na
tions Information Office,- spoke to
the group on Canada's part in the
war and peace efforts.
"In discussing world friendship,"
he said, "men have turned to me al
most with jealousy in praising
friendship between my country and
yours. For the friendship that ex
ists between our two nations is a
working model of what can be ac
complished on a world-wide scale."
Canada's Part in War
Dr. Newton told how Canada,

third largest country in size in the
world but with only IV/z million
inhabitants, has become during the
war the fourth United Nations up
ply power, the third United Nations
naval power (comprised mostly of
small ships), the fourth United Na
tions air power, and the third Unit
ed Nations trading post.
"Canada has an economy balanced
between industry and agriculture,"
he said, "and these and other fea
tures have made it one of the lead
ers of what people like to call the
'middle powers'."
Economic Security
At the Conference, he said, the
Canadians have proposed a plan for
a broader base of economic security
by including cultural and social
welfare as part of the program of
the economic and social council.
"We would also like to see greater
small nation representation on the
Security Council," he concluded.
"There are possibilities for good-na
tured compromise" in working out a
successful world security plan, he
said, adding that to achieve this goal
such compromise is essential.
