# Democracy Based on Concept Of Equality, Says Thurman
## 
### 
''Fundamental to any sound the
ory of democracy is a profound con
ception of equality—not an equal
ity based on a comparison on any
level of experience, but a conception
of equality which arises out of the
individual interpretation of his in
finite worth and value to himself,"
stated Dr. Howard Thurman at the
Tuesday Evening Series last night.
Dr. Thurman, speaking on "The Test
of Democratic Dogma," added that
"The degree to which he allows oth
er people to assume that degree of
the infinite, he becomes a part of
democracy."
After providing a background for
his talk with a reading, the speaker
suggested that "We should think to
gether tonight about the fundamen
tal meaning of democracy, and the
effect that notion has upo nthe life
of the various minorities that go to
make up American life."
Guarantee of Democracy
Dr. Thurman, speaking slowly and
calmly to the appreciative audience,
went on to say that any society
which undertakes to implement the
notion of democracy must guarantee
three things to the individual.
The first guarantee of a democracy
to the individual is "the privilege
and duty to participate responsively
in the social process." He added that
a large segment of the population,
the 12 or 13 million Negroes, "have
been systematically denied the.priv
ilege of participation in community
life," and that therefore they have
no sense of civic character as a
group.
He explained that wartime condi
tions have created civic character in
thousands of Negroes all over the
United States, but that public opin
ion of America will not accept these
new "first class citizens."
Freedoms Denied Negroes
The second guarantee of a democ
racy, said the speaker, is a thor
oughgoing sense of alternatives,
since "if there is no sense of alter
natives, there is no freedom." The
freedoms enumerated by Dr. Thur
man, which are not given to the
Negro people, are the freedom of

job opportunities, the freedom to
live where he likes, and the freedom
of equal access to public offerings
and institutions. Dr. Thurman add
ed that "when there is segregation,
there is the death of freedom."
The third function of democracy
is to "provide that .kind of climate
in which it is reasonable for any
individual to have a sense of the
future," said Dr. Thurman. To
demonstrate that this climate is not
being provided for the American
Negro, the speaker told of a letter
from a wounded soldier in the 92nd
division who reported that when
congratulations were given out for
the victory in Europe, the all-Negro
92nd division was not even men
tioned.
"The test of democratic dogma is
found in the degree to which each
of us, as individuals, are willing t©
be the embodiment of the demo
cratic notion.
