NOTES ON EDUCATION
It seems to be the concensus among students
who have braved the undergraduate wiles for a
few years that Stanford's course in the History
of Western Civ is really the student's, as well as
the professor's idea about the way courses
should be given.
Civ means provocative discussions, by the
class divided into groups of 30 or so, based
around an extensive syllabus with good ques
tions, carefully followed by the class, and week
ly supplementary lectures by the best people
in the University. The overall course has vital
information and various approaches.
It usually goes the round of undergraduate
discussions about the subject, that it is too bad
for all concerned that there are not more courses
that hold and demand the interest that Civ has
for most of us.
With midquarters just about over, and our
cramming leaving us in our usual weakened
state, we are just brimming with ideas for com
prehensive courses having this vital interest.
For instance, the class in contemparary
government that gets a couple of hundred up
at 8 a.m. this quarter. There is a course that
has a tremendous amount of material that most
students are interested in, and interested in
developing and retaining.
Right now, of course, the problem of person
nel discourages all such attempts at making dis
cussion groups, but we certainly hope that some
such plans may be written into the academic
future.
Contemporary governments provides such a
mass of material in necessary historical back
ground, as well as contemporary events in the
news, that it seems first rate discussion and ex
amination might be encouraged by such treat
ment.
The Civ courses "have something," alright,
and why not utilize that something wherever
possible-
