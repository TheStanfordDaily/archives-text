### PEGGY FITTS 
Around and about the campus, in years past
as they say, there has sprung up a select group
of anonymous pluggers who make a day's work
out of all the little homey tasks without which
the Farm wouldn't be what it is. Like the soles
of your shoes, you don't know they're there
but you'd miss them if they were gone. (Grav
elly, isn't it?). Reading from here to there, a
passing salaam is due the following:
The human who gets on the business end
of the Firehouse whistle at 12 and 5 every day
—sometimes it blows within the hour and some
times it blows after dark and sometimes it
doesn't blow at all, so there must be a human
in the picture.
The friendly people in the P.O. who drop
all the penny postcards in all the right boxes.
(Some day I'll get a letter!".
The Culbertson kids in the corner booth at
the Cellar; seems like they've been there so
long there isn't anything left but four angry
voices and four little gusts of cigaret smoke.
The unsung hero who distributes the Dailies
at pillar and post long before the demand —or
anyone else —has arisen. (And what brand of
alarm clock do you use?)
The lonely one behind the light bulb on
top of the Hoover Libe, where the lost gen
eration got lost.
The phantom record fans in the Music Lis
tening Room; nobody comes out and nobody
goes in, but Wagner goes on and on.
The parties with powerful digits who put up
those scads of posters all over the Quad; every
poster has different words, but it's always the
same old thumb-tacks and doubtless the same
old thumbs.
The sprinkler enthusiast lurking in the Inner
Quad who would rather sprinkle pedestrians
than grass any old time.
All those who missed Phi Bete by one grade
point. (Not that I minded!).
A sunny day.
