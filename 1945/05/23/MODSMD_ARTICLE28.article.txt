CONFERENCE WINDUP
Work on the proposed World Charter for the United
Nations should be completed in two weeks, according
to Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, who also
stated that the Conference has made excellent progress
so far;
He is flying to Washington to consult with President
Truman, possibly on American-Russian relations and
very possibly upon matters concerning a meeting of
the Big Three in Europe. Important decisions must
be made by the Great Powers, particularly in relation
to the political conflicts developing in Eastern Europe.
He will return to San Francisco for the closing days
of the Conference. Certain rules limiting speeches have
been adopted by the Conference to speed up work.
VOTING PROCEDURE
Voting will begin today and the important Security
Council voting procedure. President Roosevelt, Prime
Minister Churchill, and Marshal Stalin agreed at Yalta
that the five? major nations must be unanimous in any
substantive decision of the police agency. In other
words, a single veto can halt police action against an
aggressor power.
Australia proposed a "soft veto," which would re
quire unanimity among the Big Five only on questions
concerning the use of force, while peaceful settlements
would be made by a simple majority of the 11 nations
on the Council.
The big powers are opposed to the Australian plan,
but the little powers are in favor of at least a some
what more democratic process of acting in interna
tional disputes. The Big Five have 11 votes and need
four more to defeat the Australian proposal. Nations
in favor of the "soft veto" include Argentina, Bolivia,
Egypt, Cuba, and the Philippines.
REGIONAL SECURITY
The critical disagreement over the regional security
program was settled Sunday evening when Russia ap
proved in principle the United States plan for regional
pacts.
For instance the hemispheric Inter-American system
would be allowed to continue as a part of the world
security setup. If a disagreement should occur in the
Western Hemisphere between several nations, attempts
would be made to settle the problem under the pro
visions of the Inter-American agreement; however
if agreement were not reached the matter would then
be referred to the World Court.
ASSEMBLY VOTE
Substantial progress was made yesterday along the
problem of assembly vote, and it seems that decisions
of the assembly will be made by a two-thirds majority
vote. The Assembly will not have the right to expel
member nations from the United Nations.
The steering committee has presented a tentative
timetable for the Conference in which work at com
mittee level will be completed by the end of this week
or by the latest during th first days of next week.
Commission sessions, which are the next step in the
legislative process, would be finished by the end of
the second week. Two or three plenary sessions will
be held at the conclusion of the Conference during
which the delegates will be given an opportunity to
make final addresses.

CONFERENCE WINDUP
Work on the proposed World Charter for the United
Nations should be completed in two weeks, according
to Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, who also
stated that the Conference has made excellent progress
so far;
He is flying to Washington to consult with President
Truman, possibly on American-Russian relations and
very possibly upon matters concerning a meeting of
the Big Three in Europe. Important decisions must
be made by the Great Powers, particularly in relation
to the political conflicts developing in Eastern Europe.
He will return to San Francisco for the closing days
of the Conference. Certain rules limiting speeches have
been adopted by the Conference to speed up work.
VOTING PROCEDURE
Voting will begin today and the important Security
Council voting procedure. President Roosevelt, Prime
Minister Churchill, and Marshal Stalin agreed at Yalta
that the five? major nations must be unanimous in any
substantive decision of the police agency. In other
words, a single veto can halt police action against an
aggressor power.
Australia proposed a "soft veto," which would re
quire unanimity among the Big Five only on questions
concerning the use of force, while peaceful settlements
would be made by a simple majority of the 11 nations
on the Council.
The big powers are opposed to the Australian plan,
but the little powers are in favor of at least a some
what more democratic process of acting in interna
tional disputes. The Big Five have 11 votes and need
four more to defeat the Australian proposal. Nations
in favor of the "soft veto" include Argentina, Bolivia,
Egypt, Cuba, and the Philippines.
REGIONAL SECURITY
The critical disagreement over the regional security
program was settled Sunday evening when Russia ap
proved in principle the United States plan for regional
pacts.
For instance the hemispheric Inter-American system
would be allowed to continue as a part of the world
security setup. If a disagreement should occur in the
Western Hemisphere between several nations, attempts
would be made to settle the problem under the pro
visions of the Inter-American agreement; however
if agreement were not reached the matter would then
be referred to the World Court.
ASSEMBLY VOTE
Substantial progress was made yesterday along the
problem of assembly vote, and it seems that decisions
of the assembly will be made by a two-thirds majority
vote. The Assembly will not have the right to expel
member nations from the United Nations.
The steering committee has presented a tentative
timetable for the Conference in which work at com
mittee level will be completed by the end of this week
or by the latest during th first days of next week.
Commission sessions, which are the next step in the
legislative process, would be finished by the end of
the second week. Two or three plenary sessions will
be held at the conclusion of the Conference during
which the delegates will be given an opportunity to
make final addresses.
