ENCINA CHOW
To The Editor:
There are many jokes about an Army mess and also
about the Encina chow, but to'every Army student who
must eat three meals a day at*the Encina Dining Hall,
it is no joke.
We all realize that there is a terrible shortage of
food, especially here on the West Coast, but we do be
lieve that better chow is possible. Ask any of the
Army men how the food is and they will all reply—
"the worst." A typical expression is that the food is
not good enough for a pet dog back home.
Perhaps the quanity and quality of the food pur
chased cannot be changed, but at least it can be pre
pared in a manner that is fit to eat.

TRADITIONS
To The Editor:
The recent announcement in the Stanford Daily of
the "Chalet Traditional Darky Dance" and the vivid
descriptions of the setting and characterizations an
ticipated, might well give us reason to reflect upon
our selection of themes for novel entertainment.
"This "traditional" affair would bear examination.
According to the announcements, two periods of our
nation's history are mixed to the advantage of neith
er, and, which is more significant, we appear to be
missing the most important understandings that
might grow out of this cultural inconsistency.
The "darky" idea, with its colorful plantation set
ting (and even the name itself which indicates a con
dition which Negroes in general want to forget) could
could represent a period out of which something
worth while was born. Some of America's original
folk songs, spirituals, and literature belong to this era
—even though many of us still regret that we built a
portion of our country under such a system.
But when this period is linked to the present Harlem
setting with its "phosphorescent murals of "oversized
dice and liquor bottles, and grinning darkies' faces?"
we are conscious of a lack of artistic discrimination.
We wonder if this mixture adds anything of lasting
value to our campus life. Is this idea of the less-cul
utred side of Negro life something that should be per
petuated on Stanford's campus? Our University is
fostering many activities whose central purpose is to
promote intercultural understanding and appreciation.
Does this recent dance contribute at all to the realiza
tion of this worthy purpose?
If the idea for such a dance grows out of a desire
to promote appreciation for and a better understanding
of these people, could we not select some contribution
from them which has enriched our culture? Why
could we not choose some examples of the best efforts
that this group has put forth? In building ties of
friendship with our neighbors to the south (Latin
America) we choose some of the best features of their
culture for appreciation—their literature, art, music.
Since we interpret the best expressions of these
neighboring peoples, it seems that we might select
those activities which would also tend to promote
better understanding of Negroes in our country.

could represent a period out of which something
worth while was born. Some of America's original
folk songs, spirituals, and literature belong to this era
—even though many of us still regret that we built a
portion of our country under such a system.
But when this period is linked to the present Harlem
setting with its "phosphorescent murals of "oversized
dice and liquor bottles, and grinning darkies' faces?"
we are conscious of a lack of artistic discrimination.
We wonder if this mixture adds anything of lasting
value to our campus life. Is this idea of the less-cul
utred side of Negro life something that should be per
petuated on Stanford's campus? Our University is
fostering many activities whose central purpose is to
promote intercultural understanding and appreciation.
Does this recent dance contribute at all to the realiza
tion of this worthy purpose?
If the idea for such a dance grows out of a desire
to promote appreciation for and a better understanding
of these people, could we not select some contribution
from them which has enriched our culture? Why
could we not choose some examples of the best efforts
that this group has put forth? In building ties of
friendship with our neighbors to the south (Latin
America) we choose some of the best features of their
culture for appreciation—their literature, art, music.
Since we interpret the best expressions of these
neighboring peoples, it seems that we might select
those activities which would also tend to promote
better understanding of Negroes in our country.

ENCINA CHOW
To The Editor:
There are many jokes about an Army mess and also
about the Encina chow, but to'every Army student who
must eat three meals a day at*the Encina Dining Hall,
it is no joke.
We all realize that there is a terrible shortage of
food, especially here on the West Coast, but we do be
lieve that better chow is possible. Ask any of the
Army men how the food is and they will all reply—
"the worst." A typical expression is that the food is
not good enough for a pet dog back home.
Perhaps the quanity and quality of the food pur
chased cannot be changed, but at least it can be pre
pared in a manner that is fit to eat.

TRADITIONS
To The Editor:
The recent announcement in the Stanford Daily of
the "Chalet Traditional Darky Dance" and the vivid
descriptions of the setting and characterizations an
ticipated, might well give us reason to reflect upon
our selection of themes for novel entertainment.
"This "traditional" affair would bear examination.
According to the announcements, two periods of our
nation's history are mixed to the advantage of neith
er, and, which is more significant, we appear to be
missing the most important understandings that
might grow out of this cultural inconsistency.
