GUAM, Tuesday, May 22 (UP).—
American Navy patrol bombers have
sunk or damaged 16,380 tons of en
emy shipping in Japanese and Ko
rean waters, it was disclosed today,
while the enemy was able to attack
American fleet units off Okinawa
foi the first time in more than a
week.
Five light U.S. units were dam
aged when 35 enemy planes struck
at shipping Monday. The fact that
it took the enemy so long to assem
ble such a small striking force was
a graphic demonstration of the ef
fect of Superfortress and aircraft
blows.
