The San Francisco Conference
rolls on toward its conclusion. The
progress was never spectacular, and
now the Conference has lost quite a
bit of its glamour, but progress is
steady and logical.
The "regional zone" and "trustee
ship" difficulties have been settled
to a certain extent. Russia seems to
have finally agreed to the former
after Secretary Stettinius said that
these zones would not have the
power to block the General Assem
bly. The trusteeship affair has set
tled down into a revival of the old
mandate system, which was pretty
much of a joke.
Russia asked for a guaranteed
independence of people in trus
teed areas, but America balked.
The reason for our hesitation was
the number of bases we will prob
ably demand where the people
are somewhat primitive, and can
not be guaranteed their independ
ence if the place is to be anything
but a strategically useless desert
island.
Anyway, America won its point,
and the conference goes on.
The third big point, which is not
too settled, is the veto power of the
security conference. Russia claims
that the Yalta agreement guaran
teed the Security Council complete
and absolute veto power. The
smaller nations, however, have come
out in opposition.
Premier Smuts of South Africa
seems to be trying to effect a com
promise, standing for veto power
being non-existent when there is no
need for it. Since there is a strong
protest against the unlimited power
of the Council, his arrangement
might be accepted.
Behind the Scenes
One of the interesting things be
hind the scenes is the job that the
OWI is doing in covering the Con
ference. This versatile organization
is not only a psychological warfare
weapon, but a combined reporter
and historian.
The OWI is recording the whole
Conference on film, both for nations
without adequate press representa
tion to do this, the uninvited neu
trals, and for future historical ref
erence. In addition, it is giying a
regular press service to the world
via short wave.

The general press setup is inter
esting. The reporters from all over
the world are being sold cigars, cig
arettes, and liquor, as are the dele
gates, to insure constant suppliee.
They also have a free lunch counter
in the basement of the Veterans'
Building.
Special telegraphs, typewriters,
and a small reference library have
also been set up. The major press
associations from all over the world
have their little Conference head
quarters in the Veterans' building.
Conclusions
The Conference is most fascinat
ing at times, and at others most
boring. Still, it progresses. There
is no sign of a crack within its in
ternal structure, but pressure, the
pressure of events, is being brought
heavily from the outside.
The significant facts to watch are:
1. The trend of conflicting alli
ances outside of the Conference.
This might develop into an "I'll
fight on your side if you use your
veto power on mine, Big Five mem
ber" deal.
2. The suppressio onf the man
dated areas, which still goes on.
When the Syrian parliament con
vened to ask for independence, the
French did nothing save reinforce
their garrison in the capital.
3. The grab for territory without
an adequate gauge of right to ter
ritory. The World Court cannot de
cide cases of this type with justice,
since there is no standard of justice.
The interior tranquility and the
exterior turbulence have not met
yet. Both will probably go on their
way for quite a few years, but they
will eventually meet. Then, long
after the Conference is over, what
was done at San Francisco will have
its big test.
