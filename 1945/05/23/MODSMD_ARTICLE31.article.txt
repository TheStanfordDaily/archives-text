# Winzler to Discuss 'Proteose' at Seminar
## 
### 
Dr. Richard T. Winzler, assistant
professor of biochemistry at the
School of Medicine of the University
of Southern California, will speak to
the Biology Seminar this afternoon
on "Blood Proteose." Dr. Winzler,
who received the A.B. and Ph.D.
degrees from Stanford, will report
on his experimental work in this
subject.
The blood proteose is a protein
like substance which occurs in
greater concentrations in the blood
during certain pathological condi
tions. Among the methods used by
Dr. Winzler in his studies is the
polarigraphic technique.
Since his work at Stanford, Dr.
Winzler has been Sterling Fellow at
Yale, National Research Council
Fellow at Stockholm and Cornell,
and has worked with the National
Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Mary
land.
The seminar, which will be pre
ceded by a tea at 4 p.m., will begin
at 4:15 in Room 430, Jordan Hall.
Faculty, students and visitors are
welcome.
