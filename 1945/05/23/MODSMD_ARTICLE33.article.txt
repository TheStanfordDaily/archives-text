### BOB SLOBE 
With the close of this quarter also
comes the close of another year of
intramural activities, our only sub
stitute for intercollegiate competi
tion. Outstanding athletes have come
and gone, and many different groups
have brought forth winning teams.
Beginning with summer quarter
1944, the Monroe "Boozers," who
look like sure-fire repeaters this
quarter, annexed the Softball
crown behind the apt pitching of
Bob Rosburg, losing only one
game to the powerful firehouse
gang. There were no outstanding
teams that quarter as there are
now, and games were often cut
short on account of darkness.
Fall quarter saw the return of
many former intramural stars, but
the six-man football crown went to
a group of freshmen from Toyon.
Led by quarterback Jimmy Brad
shaw, son of "Rabbit" Bradshaw,
frosh football coach a number of
years back, the Arguello A.A. back
field ran circles around all the op
position. Bradshaw was ambidex
trous and constantly fooled his op
ponents by his tricky pass plays.
No one else in the league could
match the speed of Jennings, Brad
shaw, and Levy or the power of
Abrams, Pickering, and Thompson.
Arguello won the dual league cham
pionship by overwhelming Encina's
Co. C squad in the final tilt.
In basketball the Legal Eagles
led by Husby and Hartwell fin
ished strongly to defeat the A.S.T.
"Cougars" in the playoff between
the first place teams of the Lagu
nita and Roble leagues. There
were a number of outstanding
basketball players in these
leagues. "Handsome" Ken Husby
and Jack Hartwell of the Legal
Eagles, whose height continually
controlled the backboards; Morley
Thompson and George Bower of
the Betas, who racked up points
by the score; Luke Pitts, Toms
Ashley and Hood, who really gave
the crowd a show with their fast
breaks and second - half come
backs; Prescott, Catlett, and
Walker of the Cougars, whoes
teamwork was responsible for
their successful quintet.
This quarter's softball stars will
assemble to play the Army all-stars
in a game soon to be played; many
of them are stars from other quar
tersâ€”Joe Sher, Luke Pitts, Tom
Ashley, Bob Rosburg, and Ed Luce.
In the final reckoning many
thanks should go to Harry Wolter,
who has been intramural director
for the past sixteen years, and has
helped considerably to make the
Stanford curriculum something be
sides study study study.
