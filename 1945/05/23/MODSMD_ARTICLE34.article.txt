## All-League Team Chosen 
### BOB GILKEY 
After having faithfully covered
the intramural softball season for
these many weeks, we find the time
has coqie to get our head bashed in
â€”today we present our choices for
the All - League team, the lucky
squad that meets the Army ten to
morrow afternoon in the big All-
Star tussle. We have tried hard to
be fair and impartial in selecting
our All-League squad, and we sin
cerely hope that our choices will not
cause a minor revolution in campus
sports circles.
We found our toughest obstacle at
first base, where Eld Luce of Monroe,
Joe Pickering of Tyler, and Tom
Hood of Phi Psi, three of the top
olayers in the league, vied for the
honor. Because Luce was the lead
ing slugger on the championship
Boozer team, we handed him the
initial sack laurels by a slight mar
gin over PicAtering and Hood. But
since we can't vision an All-League
team without Pickering, we have
placed Joe at the first team utility
position.
Another problem occurred at
shortstop where Doc Mason of the
Med School, Bob Rosburg of Mon
roe, and Tom Ashley of Phi Psi
competed . for All-League honors.
We solved this problem by leaving
Mason at short and switching Ros
burg: to second and Ashley to the
hot corner.
The rest of the first team was
much easier to choose. Joe Sher of
Monroe, and Luke Pitts of Phi Psi
far outclassed the rest of the pitch
ers and lack of many good outfield
ers made Bob Slobe fo Tyler, Bob
Nesbit of Phi Psi, and Frank Hoff
man of Buchanan the outer garden
choices by a wide margin. Although
Hoffman handled the pitching duties
for the Bearcats during most of the
season, his powerful hitting was far
superior to his pitching, and as a
hitter rather than a hurler he de
serves a place on our All-League
team. For that reason we took the
liberty of shifting him to right field.
For the short field position, we
selected Dennis Fox of Tyler, nor

mally a third baseman. Since Fox is
gifted with an excellent throwing
arm and since he is a formidable
slugger to boot, we moved him to
the short field spot.
Behind the plate, Bob Stephens of
Phi Psi, who also did a lot of pitch
ing in the absence of Luke Pitts,
held a slight edge over Fonny Ho
of Arguello and John Hanlon of
Monroe.
