# Boozers Win In Softball League
## 
### BOB GILKEY 
The intramural Softball league
came to its premature closing in a
blaze of glory yesterday as Monroe's
Belting Boozers trounced the Med
School, 6-0, in the championship
tussle. The victory gave Monroe
eleven wins in twelve starts, while
the Medics finished a strong sec
ond, chalking up eight decisions as
against two losses to Monroe.
Joe Sher, ace Boozer pitcher who
has carried the brunt of the Mon
roe hurling duties all season, turned
in another million-dollar perform
ance, limiting the hard-hitting Med
ics to two hits. His mates opened up
with a two-run outburst in the first
inning and coasted to a decisive win.
Unlike the two exciting crucials be
tween Monroe and Phi Psi, the out
come was never in doubt, and the
Boozers clearly established them
selves as the class of the circuit.

The other two contests played
yesterday were wild and wololy
struggles with the surprising Flacs
upsetting Tyler's undermanned ten,
19-13, and Arguello piling up a sea
son record for scoring as they pum
meled the slipping Buchanan Bear
cats, 22-9.
The Tyler-Flac game was a thrill
er until the fateful sixth inning
when the victors pounded across ten
runs to move far ahead, Tyler took
an early 5-0 lead, but the Flacs re
taliated with six runs in the third to
take a slight lead. The contest see
sawed back and forth with the Hill
toppers holding a 10-9 edge at the
close of the fifth. The Flacs opened
up with their ten-run outburst and
scored their fourth win in their
five starts. Tyler, playing without
the services of several ace players
including pitcher John Glathe and
shortstop Ed Hall, suffered their first
setback in the second round of play.
The Hilltoppers finished in fourth
place, a half-game ahead of Ar
guello.
The Arguello - Buchanan debacle
was a slaughter from start to finish
as the sixth-place Bearcats were
completely demoralized. Frank Hoff
man slammed out two home runs
to aid the losing Buchanan cause.

with a two-run outburst in the first
inning and coasted to a decisive win.
Unlike the two exciting crucials be
tween Monroe and Phi Psi, the out
come was never in doubt, and the
Boozers clearly established them
selves as the class of the circuit.

The other two contests played
yesterday were wild and wololy
struggles with the surprising Flacs
upsetting Tyler's undermanned ten,
19-13, and Arguello piling up a sea
son record for scoring as they pum
meled the slipping Buchanan Bear
cats, 22-9.
The Tyler-Flac game was a thrill
er until the fateful sixth inning
when the victors pounded across ten
runs to move far ahead, Tyler took
an early 5-0 lead, but the Flacs re
taliated with six runs in the third to
take a slight lead. The contest see
sawed back and forth with the Hill
toppers holding a 10-9 edge at the
close of the fifth. The Flacs opened
up with their ten-run outburst and
scored their fourth win in their
five starts. Tyler, playing without
the services of several ace players
including pitcher John Glathe and
shortstop Ed Hall, suffered their first
setback in the second round of play.
The Hilltoppers finished in fourth
place, a half-game ahead of Ar
guello.
The Arguello - Buchanan debacle
was a slaughter from start to finish
as the sixth-place Bearcats were
completely demoralized. Frank Hoff
man slammed out two home runs
to aid the losing Buchanan cause.

The intramural Softball league
came to its premature closing in a
blaze of glory yesterday as Monroe's
Belting Boozers trounced the Med
School, 6-0, in the championship
tussle. The victory gave Monroe
eleven wins in twelve starts, while
the Medics finished a strong sec
ond, chalking up eight decisions as
against two losses to Monroe.
Joe Sher, ace Boozer pitcher who
has carried the brunt of the Mon
roe hurling duties all season, turned
in another million-dollar perform
ance, limiting the hard-hitting Med
ics to two hits. His mates opened up
with a two-run outburst in the first
inning and coasted to a decisive win.
