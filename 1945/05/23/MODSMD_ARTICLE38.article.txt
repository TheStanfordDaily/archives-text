# Chappie Out Next Week; Esquire Never Like This
## 
### 
"Chappie—the magazine for men,"
which goes on sale next week, will
offer forty rollicking pages of fea
tures, cartoons, and photographs de
signed to out-do even the famous
Esquire magazine of which it is a
take-off. The most well-known of
the cartoon figures of Esquire will
appear on the Chappies pages, aptly
mimicked by staff artists, according
to Dick Driscoll, perpetrator of the
scheme and Old Boy of the maga
zine..
Esky, the moustached gentleman
who appears on the corners of the
national magazine, joins the Old Boy
on a Chappie cover, photographed
in four colors.
"Stanford beauty, Lagunita style,"
which will occupy two pages in
color, has had the staff raving for
weeks. Art Lites, of the University
Press, has painted a two-page wa
tcrcolor of the bomber Mary Alice
to replace the Esquire feature of
war scenes by American artists.
Winning story from the winter
quarter literary contest sponsored
by Chappie will appear along with
jokes, articles and drawings by the
regular staff.
Because this magazine is slated
to be the most extravagant and art
ful display of campus humor yet

compiled under Chappie's covers, it
will sell for 35 cents, according to
Driscoll. This price is higher than
the regular Chappie—but lower than
Esquire.
