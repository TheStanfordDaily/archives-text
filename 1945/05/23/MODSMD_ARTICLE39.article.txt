# Sports Plans Include New Pavilion...

### LISA EBBERTS 
Editorial Note: This is the sev
enth in our series of articles on
Stanford's postwar outlook.
We asked Mr. Alfred Masters
about postwar Stanford, and his
thoughts flew to our athletic needs.
For Mr. Masters is manager of the
board of athletic control, and his
greatest interests include the golf
course and the men's gym.
Sports Suggestions
He had many suggestions for new
and better sports. We have a good
plant now, but he suggested several
additions, a squash court for in
stance', and box courts for handball.
We might even build our own bowl
ing alleys.
We definitely need a new basket
ball pavilion with more seating
space. Our present one is much the
worse for many hard fought games
and well attended dances. Most im
portant of all, it will only hold 2700.
That is not enough room for both
Stanford and Cal at a big basketball
game.
A new pavilion would not discard
the old one, it would merely release
it for routine duty. The bleachers
could be taken out to make room for
three crosswise courts, a valuable
addition to the gym for intramural
purposes. And it could still be used
for big dances. .
Hopefully we asked about football.
But Mr. Masters could not set a date
for the next Big Game. With the
rest of us he is hoping for a quick
return of all intercollegiate sports.
Changes In Rules
Then Mr. Masters made a startling
statement. He would like to see
some changes in the Pacific Coast
C6nference rules. He likes the Code
as a whole, but several sections are
very severe.
The entertainment rule for in
stance. In Salinas this year the Stan
ford Alumni held a tea for an entire
group of high school boys and girls
who had just taken the Stanford ap
titude. test. Under the code rules,
any boy who attended this tea would
automatically have been barred from
ever representing Stanford in any
sport.
Here is another example of sever
ity. One Stanford alumnus wrote to
members of the all-state high school
teams in Oklahoma and Texas. He
assumed they would go to their own
state universities. But in case they
did not, he suggested that they con
sider Stanford.
No offers of any kind were made,
but for merely opening the letters
those boys were barred from ever
representing Stanford in any sport.
In actual fact, none of them were
entered here or had shown any in
terest. But if one of them had later
come here, he coqld not have com
peted with our teams against any
other college.
Can Rules Be Modified?
Mr. Masters is certainly against
going back to the old system of bid
ing for athletes. He merely asks,
"Can't some of these objectionable
and unfair rules be modified?"
