# Forum Analyzes Charter
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
The San Fr-ancisco Charter will
carry out the chief provisions of the
Dumbarton Oaks proposal agreed
the four panel members of the Palo

Alto Forum in analyzing the progress
of the Conference so far at the
meeting Monday night. The chief
presumptions of Dumbarton O'aks,
they decided, Were the establish
ment of a framework for world gov
ernment and the provision that force
would be used to enforce peace.
The panel was composed of Dr.
Philip Buck, professor of political
science; Dr. Shau Wing Chan, as
sistant professor of Chinese and
Humanities; Dr. Rudolf Holsti, acting
professor of political science, and
Dr. Harry B. Reynolds of Palo Alto.
Dr. Buck Moderator
Dr. Buck, as moderator for the
group, directed the discussion about
three main points: Amendments
which have been made or suggested
at the Conference, discussion of cor
ollary issues, and predictions about
what will be done before the Con
ference adjourns.
Dr. Buck stated that the "bill of
rights" incorporated into the charter
was added in response to the de
mands from many delegates for the
protection of minority groups and
for a broader statement of the prin
ciples of international justice.
'Rights' Amendment
Dr. Chan agreed with Dr. Buck
that the bill of human rights was
a valuable amendment to the Char

ter, and Dr. Holsti added that we
need rather high goals for the na
tions of the organization to aim for.
Dr. Reynolds expressed his oppo
sition to the inclusion of a bill of
rights in a charter by saying, "it is
not wise to put in rights which even
we in America aren't willing to live
up to," adding that there should be
common ground for everything
which is put into the Charter.
Carrying Out 'Rights'
The question was then raised as
to what provisions would be made
to carry out the aims of the "in
ternational bill of rights." The Se
curity and Economic Council was
suggested by Dr. Chan as the most
likely agency, and Dr. Buck agreed,
although including the assembly,
which has recently been given the
power to investigate internal condi
tions of the member nations, he
said.
"The more we extend the power
of the assembly, the more we will
extend the democratic basis of the
organization," said Dr. Chan, and* Dr.
Holsti stated that the proposed or
ganization is less democratic than

the League of Nations. Holsti and
Buck countered that it is more im
portant to get agreement now with
assembly powers limited, than ex
tend its powers as it proves itself
capable of using them.
Regional Security Agreement
The panel members believed that
an agreement would be reached on
the issue of regional security, in
which each region would be able
to block action by the security coun
cil in their geographical area by a
sort of veto arrangement, the Coun
cil entering the dispute only when
the regional security provisions fail.
Personnel of High Level
All panel members agreed that the
personnel of the delegations was of
a very high level; Dr. Chan em
phasized that the delegates were well
chosen and that their many contri
butions in committee meetings
proved that they are men of ability.
The panel concluded the discussion
with the hopeful prediction that the
Charter would be ratified by the
member nations and, more import
ant, the people of the world would
continue to support the provisions
of the organization.

group, directed the discussion about
three main points: Amendments
which have been made or suggested
at the Conference, discussion of cor
ollary issues, and predictions about
what will be done before the Con
ference adjourns.
Dr. Buck stated that the "bill of
rights" incorporated into the charter
was added in response to the de
mands from many delegates for the
protection of minority groups and
for a broader statement of the prin
ciples of international justice.
'Rights' Amendment
Dr. Chan agreed with Dr. Buck
that the bill of human rights was
a valuable amendment to the Char

ter, and Dr. Holsti added that we
need rather high goals for the na
tions of the organization to aim for.
Dr. Reynolds expressed his oppo
sition to the inclusion of a bill of
rights in a charter by saying, "it is
not wise to put in rights which even
we in America aren't willing to live
up to," adding that there should be
common ground for everything
which is put into the Charter.
Carrying Out 'Rights'
The question was then raised as
to what provisions would be made
to carry out the aims of the "in
ternational bill of rights." The Se
curity and Economic Council was
suggested by Dr. Chan as the most
likely agency, and Dr. Buck agreed,
although including the assembly,
which has recently been given the
power to investigate internal condi
tions of the member nations, he
said.
"The more we extend the power
of the assembly, the more we will
extend the democratic basis of the
organization," said Dr. Chan, and* Dr.
Holsti stated that the proposed or
ganization is less democratic than

the League of Nations. Holsti and
Buck countered that it is more im
portant to get agreement now with
assembly powers limited, than ex
tend its powers as it proves itself
capable of using them.
Regional Security Agreement
The panel members believed that
an agreement would be reached on
the issue of regional security, in
which each region would be able
to block action by the security coun
cil in their geographical area by a
sort of veto arrangement, the Coun
cil entering the dispute only when
the regional security provisions fail.
Personnel of High Level
All panel members agreed that the
personnel of the delegations was of
a very high level; Dr. Chan em
phasized that the delegates were well
chosen and that their many contri
butions in committee meetings
proved that they are men of ability.
The panel concluded the discussion
with the hopeful prediction that the
Charter would be ratified by the
member nations and, more import
ant, the people of the world would
continue to support the provisions
of the organization.
