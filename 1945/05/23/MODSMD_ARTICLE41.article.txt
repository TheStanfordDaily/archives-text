# Stanford Bawlout Had Ups 'n Downs
## 
### ROD BROWNING 
In 1891, soon after Stanford Uni
versity had got under way, there
were enough students with ad
vanced standing to represent all of
the four college classes. For the
convenience of the students and
the various school offices, the first
"Bawl-out" (Directory of Students)
was published at this time. No rec
ord of the students' grade points or
hours was included in this "Bawl
out," just the name, address and
class of each student were given, to
gether with a list of the faculty.
Began to Include Everything
By the year 1901 the name "Bawl
out" had been attached to the Di
rectory because it revealed all low
er division students who paraded
around as seniors and juniors. It
was in 1901 that the number of
hours, gained by each student, was
put in the "Bawl-Out." The first
World War came and went, and by
1920 the booklet had become a per
manent part of Stanford life. There
were besides addresses, home towns,
work by units, designations of lower
division, upper division, graduate;
all. organizations with officers, pro
fessors, instructors, and office staffs,
to be found within its pages. To
this list of information were added
the grade points of the students.
Sporadic protests against the pub
lishing of grade points arose
throughout' the 1920'5, but in that
memorable year of 1933, an anti
"Bawlout" campaign appeared here
at Stanford. The following excerpts
are taken from the editorial columns
of the Stanford Daily at that time.
Quotes from '33 Daily
"It contains much valuable infor
mation. Starts out with a surefire
readers' punch, a calendar. Then a
list of trustees. The book ends
with pertinent information about
fire whistles. Thus we hear that fire
zone 65 is Shinckles' Ranch, 46 finds
us in the East Arboretun, while 63
is the Isolation Hospital and Nelson's
picnic grounds.
"But the most read parts of the
"Bawl-outs" are the grade point av
erages of each student ... it is this
grade rating that marks this viper
in the educational grasses for certain
death. . . . That system of digits
that provides registrars with some
thing to do, that necessary evil in
an era of degrees and such rot!"

Daily Canvassed Opinion
The Stanford Daily then carried
out interviews of most of the fac
ulty and administration officers on
campus. The results showed that
many of the faculty and officers were
either against the publishing of grade
points in the "Bawl-out" or were
willing to uphold the decision of
a majority of the students in an
election on the subject. Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, President of the Uni
versity, who was on his way to Chi
cago at the time, said, "You make
your record. We merely keep it."
Dr. Wilbur Spoke
The Daily was attempting to obtain
a student vote on the issue, but
it was delayed until the return of
Dr. Wilbur. But when he did return
he stated that the "Bawl-out" was
not doing any harm to the campus.
"Isn't it fair," he said, "to give rec
ognition to those who attain suc
cess? Just because it is a little hard
for the people at the bottom, is no
reason for doing away with it. We
have to be able to meet competi
tion, it is a part of life. Grades are
a person's standing in relation to his
fellow students. It's life's reality,
why not face the facts? We can't
go around with a bunch of excuses.
That's the trouble with a lot of
people." .
"Bawl-out" Won Out
And there ended the crusade to
eliminate the "Bawl-out" from Stan
ford life. The final authority had
spoken. Needless to say that with
the next quarter came the "Bawl
out" in full glory.

"Bawl-out" Won Out
And there ended the crusade to
eliminate the "Bawl-out" from Stan
ford life. The final authority had
spoken. Needless to say that with
the next quarter came the "Bawl
out" in full glory.
In 1891, soon after Stanford Uni
versity had got under way, there
were enough students with ad
vanced standing to represent all of
the four college classes. For the
convenience of the students and
the various school offices, the first
"Bawl-out" (Directory of Students)
was published at this time. No rec
ord of the students' grade points or
hours was included in this "Bawl
out," just the name, address and
class of each student were given, to
gether with a list of the faculty.
Began to Include Everything
By the year 1901 the name "Bawl
out" had been attached to the Di
rectory because it revealed all low
er division students who paraded
around as seniors and juniors. It
was in 1901 that the number of
hours, gained by each student, was
put in the "Bawl-Out." The first
World War came and went, and by
1920 the booklet had become a per
manent part of Stanford life. There
were besides addresses, home towns,
work by units, designations of lower
division, upper division, graduate;
all. organizations with officers, pro
fessors, instructors, and office staffs,
to be found within its pages. To
this list of information were added
the grade points of the students.
Sporadic protests against the pub
lishing of grade points arose
throughout' the 1920'5, but in that
memorable year of 1933, an anti
"Bawlout" campaign appeared here
at Stanford. The following excerpts
are taken from the editorial columns
of the Stanford Daily at that time.
Quotes from '33 Daily
"It contains much valuable infor
mation. Starts out with a surefire
readers' punch, a calendar. Then a
list of trustees. The book ends
with pertinent information about
fire whistles. Thus we hear that fire
zone 65 is Shinckles' Ranch, 46 finds
us in the East Arboretun, while 63
is the Isolation Hospital and Nelson's
picnic grounds.
"But the most read parts of the
"Bawl-outs" are the grade point av
erages of each student ... it is this
grade rating that marks this viper
in the educational grasses for certain
death. . . . That system of digits
that provides registrars with some
thing to do, that necessary evil in
an era of degrees and such rot!"

Daily Canvassed Opinion
The Stanford Daily then carried
out interviews of most of the fac

campus. The results showed that
many of the faculty and officers were
either against the publishing of grade
points in the "Bawl-out" or were
willing to uphold the decision of
a majority of the students in an
election on the subject. Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, President of the Uni
versity, who was on his way to Chi

your record. We merely keep it."

a student vote on the issue, but
it was delayed until the return of
