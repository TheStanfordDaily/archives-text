# Race Tension Due to Housing Segregation
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
Housing restrictions in Palo Alto
as well as elsewhere throughout
California which discriminate against
non-Caucasions are responsible for
much of the racial tension in the
state, said Albert Manley, director
of Negro education in North Caro
lina, in a talk before the Wesley
Club Sunday evening. Mr. Manley,
who is attending Stanford now as a
graduate student working for the
doctor's degree in education, spoke
to. the group on the problems created
or aggravated by the migration of
southern Negroes and Whites to war
plants in the north, and in Califor
nia.

As a background for the talk, Mr.
Manley read excerpts from the De
cember, 1944, issue of Business Week.
These excerpts reported the large
increase in population in California
since the start of the war, especially
the increase in Negro population.
Other selections from the magazine
emphasized that both Whites and
Negroes from the South had to ad
just to new circumstances, that the
cause of discrimination by certain
labor unions and employees the Ne
groes would be the first to be fired
when employment in shipyards and
aircraft plants drops off, and that
race riots are threatened in some
parts of the state because of racial
tensions.
Problem Also in Los Angeles
During the question period, the
speaker told of the serious housing
conditions in the Los Angeles area
and of the segregation practiced
there in the public schools. To
bring the subject a little closer
home, Mr. Manley told of an honor
ably discharged serviceman who
was not allowed to buy a house
where he wanted to in Palo Alto
because of housing restrictions
against all non-Caucasians which
apply in most of the residential areas
of Palo Alto.
In response to another question,
the speaker stated stated that mor
ale among Negro troops is very low
because of the discriminatory treat
men they have received both in and
out of the service. He felt that
Negro servicemen were not very
optimistic about their chance to be
treated decently in America after
the war.
Action Urged
When the group asked about the
opportunities for them to do some
thing positive to eliminate discrimi
nation and prejudice in the local
area, Mr. Manley and his wife, who
had helped out during the question
period, gave several suggestions.

Among these were: Write to your
state assemblyman and request fav
orable action on Assembly Bill 3
to create a Fair Employment Prac
tices Commission for California;
come to meetings of the local chapter
of the National Chapter for the Ad
vancement of Colored People; and
call on newly arrived Negro families
in an effort to help them adjust
themselves to their new environ
ment.
