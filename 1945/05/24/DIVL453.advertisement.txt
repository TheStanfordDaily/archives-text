KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE
WHOLE STANFORD FAMILY-JO/W THE
Stanford Alumni Association
Get the "Stanford Alumni Review" each month and keep in step
with Stanford men and women from 91 to 48. Follow their ac
tivities in the service, on the home front, in business, and on the
campus.
AND HERE'S GOOD NEWS-not only can you join the Alumni
Association while you're still a student, but you can join as a Life
Member and save $10! i
The Association's life membership is regularly $60 cash or $66
in six equal annual payments of $ 1 1 each. But if you join while still
a registered student, the rate is only $50 cash, or $54 in installments
($lO down and $1 1 a year for four years.)
The regular annual membership fee is $4, or only $2 if you re in
the armed forces.
