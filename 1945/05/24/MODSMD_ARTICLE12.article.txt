# Speech Cancelled; America First Leader Takes Walk
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
"Look at all the photographers!
I wonder what's happened?"
"It must be something important;
the place is swarming with police
men."
Meeting Canceled
"The people seem to be gathered
around that guy in back of that car.
I wonder if it has anything to do
with Smith's talk? Maybe the meet
ing has been canceled."
Last Thursday eVening two curi
ous Farm students traveled to the
city to hear what "America's lead

ing nationalist" had to say about
world affairs in general and the San
Francisco Conference in particular.
The above conversation shows how
they decided that the meeting had
j been canceled.
Trek to Fairmont
After confirming this guess from
a huge banner strung up in the lob
by of the Mark Hopkins, the Stan
fordites decided to join the chase
of the America First leader who was
heading across toward the Fairmont.
Mr. Smith stopped outside the
second hotel to throw out a hand
ful of printed sheets, which a group
of his fans quickly snatched up.
"That's a lot of propaganda,"
growled a news photographer who
had climbed part way up a lamp
post to get a shot of the crowd.
'Not Propaganda'
"It is not propaganda—it's the
truth," retorted a man who was still
complaining under his breath about
| the cancellation of the meeting.
From the crowd which was push
ing its way into the Fairmont a
woman's voice was heard, "America
will be sorry she didn't listen to
him." Her two companions nodded
i their assent.
'Seditious Crowd'
An angry voice insisted loudly,
"This is a seditious crowd if I ever
saw one."
Inside the hotel, the two young
i innocents asked a bored - looking
newsman where the "great man"
was, and v/ere promptly introduced
] to his companion, a reporter from
I the Examiner and "a greater man,"
i according to the informant. He then
.suspiciously pointed out Mr. Smith.
: adding a nasty crack to the effect
! that we'd better not ask for Smith's
autograph.

Snoops Wiggle
Smith, tall, broad-shouldered, and
calm, was talking to several people
gathered around him as the Stanford
snoops wiggled their way within
hearing range. He was quietly giv
ing his views of the day's events.
"I'm an America Firster and they
didn't want me to talk during the
San Francisco Conference. I'm not
mad about it, or resentful. I've got
a sense of humor. But I think they
defeated their purpose in stopping
me because when free speech is
suppressed," — here he paused to
smile as a newsman took a picture
of him — "people become curious
about what was going to be said."
Sticks and Helmets
Two solemn MP's wearing white
helmets walked slowly by the group,
their night sticks swinging at their
sides.
The big man turned and walked
slowly across the lobby, out the
glass doors and down the steps to a
waiting taxi; he paused to shake
hands with a couple of hangers-on,
then rode off.
Sailor Cynical
In the crowd still lingering about
outside, sentiment is divided. Amid
complaints about freedom of speech
are heard sharp denunciations of
the America First Leader. One
young sailor said cynically, "This
is my first night in San Francisco,
and this is what I find."
The crowd slowly dispersed and
(he passers-by no longer craned
their inquisitive necks. The row of
Army cars parked across the street
from the Fairmont left one by one.
Two Stanford students consoled
themselves with Spencer Tracy and
Kathcrine Hepburn in "Without
I Love," still wondering what might
J have happened that night.
"Look at all the photographers!
I wonder what's happened?"
"It must be something important;
the place is swarming with police
men."

autograph.

Snoops Wiggle
Smith, tall, broad-shouldered, and
calm, was talking to several people
gathered around him as the Stanford
snoops wiggled their way within
hearing range. He was quietly giv
ing his views of the day's events.
"I'm an America Firster and they
didn't want me to talk during the
San Francisco Conference. I'm not
mad about it, or resentful. I've got
a sense of humor. But I think they
defeated their purpose in stopping
me because when free speech is
suppressed," — here he paused to
smile as a newsman took a picture
of him — "people become curious
about what was going to be said."
Sticks and Helmets
Two solemn MP's wearing white
helmets walked slowly by the group,
their night sticks swinging at their
sides.
The big man turned and walked
slowly across the lobby, out the
glass doors and down the steps to a
waiting taxi; he paused to shake
hands with a couple of hangers-on,
then rode off.
Sailor Cynical
In the crowd still lingering about
outside, sentiment is divided. Amid
complaints about freedom of speech
are heard sharp denunciations of
the America First Leader. One
young sailor said cynically, "This
is my first night in San Francisco,
and this is what I find."
The crowd slowly dispersed and
(he passers-by no longer craned
their inquisitive necks. The row of
Army cars parked across the street
from the Fairmont left one by one.
Two Stanford students consoled
themselves with Spencer Tracy and
Kathcrine Hepburn in "Without
I Love," still wondering what might
J have happened that night.
"Look at all the photographers!
I wonder what's happened?"
"It must be something important;
the place is swarming with police
men."
Meeting Canceled
"The people seem to be gathered
around that guy in back of that car.
I wonder if it has anything to do
with Smith's talk? Maybe the meet
ing has been canceled."
Last Thursday eVening two curi
ous Farm students traveled to the
city to hear what "America's lead

ing nationalist" had to say about
world affairs in general and the San
Francisco Conference in particular.
The above conversation shows how
they decided that the meeting had
j been canceled.
Trek to Fairmont
After confirming this guess from
a huge banner strung up in the lob
by of the Mark Hopkins, the Stan
fordites decided to join the chase
of the America First leader who was
heading across toward the Fairmont.
Mr. Smith stopped outside the
second hotel to throw out a hand
ful of printed sheets, which a group
of his fans quickly snatched up.
"That's a lot of propaganda,"
growled a news photographer who
had climbed part way up a lamp
post to get a shot of the crowd.
'Not Propaganda'
"It is not propaganda—it's the
truth," retorted a man who was still
complaining under his breath about
| the cancellation of the meeting.
From the crowd which was push
ing its way into the Fairmont a
woman's voice was heard, "America
will be sorry she didn't listen to
him." Her two companions nodded
i their assent.
'Seditious Crowd'
An angry voice insisted loudly,
"This is a seditious crowd if I ever
saw one."
Inside the hotel, the two young
i innocents asked a bored - looking
newsman where the "great man"
was, and v/ere promptly introduced
] to his companion, a reporter from
I the Examiner and "a greater man,"
i according to the informant. He then
