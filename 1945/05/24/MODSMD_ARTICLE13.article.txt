# Color Highlights Opera Tonight
## 
### 
With Bruce Stewart playing the
gay, roistering Falstaff, colorful
costumes for both the leads and the
choruses, and settings based on the
medieval pageant wagons, Otto Ni
colai's comic opera, "The Merry
Wives of Windsor," is scheduled to
start at 8:15 tonight on the main
stage of Memorial Auditorium.
F. Cowles Strickland of the De
partment of Speech and Drama is
director of the production. Herbert
Jan Popper is directing the music of

the show. A large student chorus
and orchestra will participate.
Mrs. Popper Plays Wife
Lois Ilartzell and Beta Popper will
play the two leading roles of the
merry wives, Mistress Ford and
Mistress Page. Mrs. Popper has ap
peared many times with the Stan
ford Players in opera here at Stan
ford.
The two jealous husbands, Mr.
Ford and Mr. Page, will be sung by
Edward Wellman and Jack Taylor.
This will be Taylor's first major

role in opera, although he has ap
peared in many Gaieties and Spring
Shows.
Lover Holes
Smith and Joseph Tissier will
sing the parts of the two lovers,
Anne Page and Fenton. Stanford
faculty members Harlen Adams and
B. Q. Morgan will sing two smaller
comic roles.
The costume committee, Muriel
Hopkins, Mary Higgins, and Candy
Taylor, has worked out the cos
tumes in late 15th and early 16th

century styles. Choruses will wear
shades of purple, aqua, and char
treuse. In the third act, the bugs
who pinch FalstafT will be dressed
in costumes of these colors with
glittering wings and huge protrud
ing eyes added to them.
Gothic Style Sets
The sets for this opera are usually
done in Elizabethan style, accord
ing to Wendell Cole, technical di
rector, but are being done here in
late Gothic style. The first two acts
will have sets that resemble those

used for the miracle and mystery
plays in the Middle Ages.
Set wagons will be moved on and
of! stage during the course of these
acts. Some of the time there will be
more than one set on the stage at
once. Some of the scenes are the
Garter Inn, the Ford house, the Page
house, and the city of Windsor.
The third act will show the Wind
sor wood done in late Gothic style
with trees in the foreground and a
ruined castle in the background,
typical of scenes in the late Middle
Ages.
