## 
### 
LONDON, May 2.1 UP). â€”Prime Minister Winston Churchill paved the
way for Great Britain's first general election in nine and a half years by
resigning today and asking King George VI to dissolve Parliament.
The King asked Churchill to form an interim government and it was
announced that Parliament would be dissolved June 15 by royal proclama-

tion, completing the preliminaries
for an election about July 5.
Labor party leaders made it plain
that they would fight for a platform
which called for better relations
with Russia and drastic nationaliza
tion of industry.


Winston S. Churchill
