# To Discuss Free India
## 
### KARL SCHUG 
In what will probably be her last
public appearance in this country
before returning to her native land,
Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Indian
Nationalist leader, will speak in the

Scottish Rite Auditorium, San Fran
cisco, on the "free India" policies of
the imprisoned Nationalist leaders
Monday at 8 p.m.
Fights Cor Independence
Since arriving in this country,
Madame Pundit has been actively
fighting for Indian independence.
She has appeared on "The Town
Meeting of the Air" and has spoken
to both houses of the California
state legislature, as well as giving
many public talks on the subject.
Mrs. Pandit has often been a po
litical prisoner in the British jails in
India along with other leading Na
tionalist leaders. Since her release
in 1943 she has toured the famine
areas in India and has started the
"Save the Children Fund," which
has established many centers for
famine-orphans. The proceeds from
her talks in this country arc being
used to support this and other hu
manitarian activities.
Increased Expenditure
The effect of Mrs. Pandit's visit
to this country can be well illus
trated by the fact that the British
Information Service in this country
has been forced to quadruple its
expenditures in an attempt to coun
teract this influence. Despite this
increased expenditure, most experts
agree that the majority of the
American people arc on the side of
Indian independence.
Nexl Monday's meeting is spon
sored by the National Committee for
India's Freedom and is open to the
public. Reserved scat tickets may
be obtained free of charge by con
tacting K. L. Dixit, 1(57 University
Avenue, P.A. 72(>!>, on Friday or
Saturday of this week. All those
interested in going should plan to
get there early, as several hundred
people were turned away at her
last public meeting in (lie audito
rium, according to Mr. Dixit.
