# Cal Breaks Joffre Tie; France Alliance, Topic
## Small Fakes Second on 'One World' Case; Anglo-U.S.-French Urged 
### 
Juanita Olsen of Cal carried off
the JofTre medal ia.st night with a
closely woven negative case that
gave Cal a one-point lead in the
annual Cal-Stanford tourney.

Second-place rating was given
Stanford's sophomore debater, Mar
shall Small, and third place went to
Anne Wansley of Cal. The six con
testants battled over the proposition:
"Resolved, that France should orient
her foreign policy toward Great
Britain and the United tSates," with
emphasis throughout the competi
tion on the necessity of French se
curity in the post-war world.
France's 'lie with the West
Affirmative speakers, Mary Fran
ces Westcott, Anne Wansley and
Victoria Sellens, built their conten
tions around economic, cultural and
political sympathies that have long
tied France to the Western powers.
The three cases were summed up
in the words of Miss Westcott, who
gave "Go west, young French Re
public," as advice to the new France,
The negative, however, was not
satisfied with a France-Great Brit
ain-United States alliance. Speak
ers Marshall Small, Allan Jenkins
and Juanita Olsen gave various so
lutions to France's determination for
security, ranging from neutrality to
an alliance with Russia.
Winning Argument
Miss Olsen built her medal-win
ning argument around three as
sumptions: first, that orientation of
France toward any block of powers
is to her detriment; second, that
France, if she must have allies,
might well lead a block of the small
er European powers; and third, if
she must orient herself toward any
major power, Russia is as good a
choice as Great Britain and the
United States.
Franco in Wolrd Relations
"France would only weaken the
peace structure by currying the fa
for of one or two powers," Miss
Olsen claimed. Her argument stood
the fire of the five rebuttal speeches
that, preceded her own.
Second - place winner Marshall
Small based his French foreign pol
icy plans on the opportunity France
now has to cement Anglo-American
and Russian relations by remaining
a fulcrum. "France must orient her
self I oward one world," he contend
ed, not toward a block of Western
powers that would sever Soviet
Russia from the community of na
tions."
Opinions Differ on Russia
Russia received her share of dis
cussion during the contest, as occa
sionally the battleground shifted
from French soil to the Soviet. She
was characterized in lights ranging
from"the coming menace" to a na
tion fearing the enmity of a hostile
Western world.
Mr. Jacques Bacvcns, Conscilleur
d'Ambassade, Charge du Consulat
General de France, presented the
silver medal to Miss Olscn, after a
gracious speech outlining France's
hopes for the coming world.
Anxious spectators at the contest
were the two rival coaches, Profes
sor J. Gordon Emerson of Stanford
and Dr. Jacobus ten√ürek of Cal.
Also present were five officers of the
Alliance Franqaise, who have con
tinued the French government's in
terest in the yearly JofTje contcst.
