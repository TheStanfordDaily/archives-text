DEMOCRACY HAS ITS DAY
FOR SPECIAL DELIVERY MEN
The much maligned lorces of democracy oc
casionally have their day. Such a day is in
pari accomplished in the question of the gov
ernment treatment of the Special Delivery man,
whose omission from a new postal reclassifica
tion bill, v/e helped call to the attention of the
campus last quarter.
This issue, vividly represented to the campus,
by our familiarity with the work of our own
Special Delivery Man, Mr. Robert Collyer, in
cited Stanford students and professors to write
their Washington representatives concerning
the inertia of the Post Office in urging full ef
fect for the bill.
This helped the situation created by the many
active Special Delivery men themselves, and
when the bill reached the House it included
these men and it passed with little argument
by a vote of 360 to 1.
The bill, known as H R 3035, will now go
to the Senate via the Senate Post Office Com
mittee, headed by Kennelh McKellar, Tennes
see. The bill includes an annual salary accord
ing to seniority classifications for the Special
Delivery men, provides compensation for the
use of their own automobiles, overtime pay, and
general benefits to postal workers in general,
thut have been shamefully overdue for these
workers.
These initial efforts have taken this bill over
the first hurdle before the House, and certainly
the effort needed to be expended before the
Post Office Committee and the Senate, itself, is
v/ell compensated in aiding this worthwhile
piece of legislation.
