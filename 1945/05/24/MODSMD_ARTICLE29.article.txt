"What was that?" said Alice to herself as something
went zooming past her head; then whatever it was
broke with a terrible smash against the tree behind
Alice, and she saw that it had once been a China
plate.
Nevertheless Alice opened the door and went in.
The door led into a large kitchen which was full of
smoke from one end to the other—the Duchess was
sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing
;i baby -the Cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron of soup.
"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!"
reclaimed Alice, who couldn't help sneezing.
"There most certainly is not!" cried the Cook, shy
ing China plates at Alice's head. "Oh, excuse me!"
said the Cook suddenly, just as he was about to throw
the frying pan at Alice, as well, "I thought you were
my wife!" And he threw the frying pan at the Duch
ess, and hurriedly added a little mo erpepper to the
soup.
The Duchess ducked the frying pan and went on
rocking her baby.
"What a wonderful temper you have!" exclaimed
Alice in admiration, "to let your husband behave like
that, without getting a bit perturbed."
"Oh, it's not patience," replied the Duchess re
signedly, "it's a matter of convenience. Neither
of iis can stand one another, so he throws things at
me until they're all down this end of the room; then
it's my turn to get mad, and I throw them all hack.' 1
"Goodness!" cried Alice, utterly shocked at such a
state of things, "How did this ever come about?"
"The most wonderful thing in the world," said the
Duchess, smothering the baby in her skirt to muffle
its screams, "is love."
"Then," said Alice hopefully, "it couldn't have been
real love, or it couldn't have misled you so!"
"Nonsense!" cried the Duchess irritably as she
ducked two coffee cups and a gravy boat, "db you
know nothing of Psychology? It proves, quite on
(lie contrary, that it was true love—else how could
we have made such a silly mistake?"
"But love," said Alice perplexedly, "me nasbeing
kind and gentle and considerate."
"My goodness!" exclaimed the Duchess, shocked at
Alice's naivete, "haven't >jpu read Freud? Have you
never heard of the Libido? Of the dark and nasty cor
ners of your nature?"
"Why, no," said Alice sweetly, "I thought that I was
just Alice inside, and not much else."
"Actually," said the Duchess, beating her child rath
er noisily with an egg-beater, "very little of you is
Alice; most of you is Freud, and a very dark, sinister
Freud at that!"
"But what possible good is it trying to be like Freud
inside?" complained Alice, "if I really ought to be
Alice."
"Because," replied the Duchess as she dodged the
water pitcher and an empty pepper-shaker, "no one
could understand you if you weren't; it would drive
the psychoanalysts mad if you didn't behave the way
they say you must."
"Do you mean to say," said Alice, "that people can
really tell what I'm like inside?"
"Hum!" said the Duchess, prodding the baby with
a mixing spoon to see if it were asleep or merely un
conscious, "to tell the truth they can't; however they
must make up some very interesting stories about what
they suspect goes on inside. And they have fasci
natingly suspicious, minds."
"But what possible good does it do," said Alice, who
was still slightly puzzled, "to know so much about
what goes on inside, if it's mostly all wrong?"
"Because," replied the Duchess, "even if it's wrong,

it's consistent and therefore it cr.n solve problems. It
makes it possible for the Cook and myself to realize
that although we do have a slight difference in super
ficial opinions, somewhere deep deep down we prob
ably have a common bond of great strength."
"But doesn't all this confusion have a bad effect on
your child?" asked Alice in wonderment, as she dodged
a mixing bowl and a silver soup turreen.
"No," said the Dutchess shortly, and she thrust the
baby into Alice's arms, "I should think not! It's best
for a child's character if its parents fight openly instead
of hating quietly behind one another's backs."
"What was that?" said Alice to herself as something
went zooming past her head; then whatever it was
broke with a terrible smash against the tree behind

of iis can stand one another, so he throws things at
me until they're all down this end of the room; then
it's my turn to get mad, and I throw them all hack.' 1
"Goodness!" cried Alice, utterly shocked at such a
state of things, "How did this ever come about?"
"The most wonderful thing in the world," said the
Duchess, smothering the baby in her skirt to muffle
its screams, "is love."
"Then," said Alice hopefully, "it couldn't have been
real love, or it couldn't have misled you so!"
"Nonsense!" cried the Duchess irritably as she
ducked two coffee cups and a gravy boat, "db you
know nothing of Psychology? It proves, quite on
(lie contrary, that it was true love—else how could
we have made such a silly mistake?"
"But love," said Alice perplexedly, "me nasbeing
kind and gentle and considerate."
"My goodness!" exclaimed the Duchess, shocked at
Alice's naivete, "haven't >jpu read Freud? Have you
never heard of the Libido? Of the dark and nasty cor
ners of your nature?"
"Why, no," said Alice sweetly, "I thought that I was
just Alice inside, and not much else."
"Actually," said the Duchess, beating her child rath
er noisily with an egg-beater, "very little of you is
Alice; most of you is Freud, and a very dark, sinister
Freud at that!"
"But what possible good is it trying to be like Freud
inside?" complained Alice, "if I really ought to be
Alice."
"Because," replied the Duchess as she dodged the
water pitcher and an empty pepper-shaker, "no one
could understand you if you weren't; it would drive
the psychoanalysts mad if you didn't behave the way
they say you must."
"Do you mean to say," said Alice, "that people can
really tell what I'm like inside?"
"Hum!" said the Duchess, prodding the baby with
a mixing spoon to see if it were asleep or merely un
conscious, "to tell the truth they can't; however they
must make up some very interesting stories about what
they suspect goes on inside. And they have fasci
natingly suspicious, minds."
"But what possible good does it do," said Alice, who
was still slightly puzzled, "to know so much about
what goes on inside, if it's mostly all wrong?"
"Because," replied the Duchess, "even if it's wrong,

it's consistent and therefore it cr.n solve problems. It
makes it possible for the Cook and myself to realize
that although we do have a slight difference in super
ficial opinions, somewhere deep deep down we prob
ably have a common bond of great strength."
"But doesn't all this confusion have a bad effect on
your child?" asked Alice in wonderment, as she dodged
a mixing bowl and a silver soup turreen.
"No," said the Dutchess shortly, and she thrust the
baby into Alice's arms, "I should think not! It's best
for a child's character if its parents fight openly instead
of hating quietly behind one another's backs."
"What was that?" said Alice to herself as something
went zooming past her head; then whatever it was
broke with a terrible smash against the tree behind
Alice, and she saw that it had once been a China
plate.
Nevertheless Alice opened the door and went in.
The door led into a large kitchen which was full of
smoke from one end to the other—the Duchess was
sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing
;i baby -the Cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron of soup.
"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!"
reclaimed Alice, who couldn't help sneezing.
"There most certainly is not!" cried the Cook, shy
ing China plates at Alice's head. "Oh, excuse me!"
said the Cook suddenly, just as he was about to throw
the frying pan at Alice, as well, "I thought you were
my wife!" And he threw the frying pan at the Duch
ess, and hurriedly added a little mo erpepper to the
soup.
The Duchess ducked the frying pan and went on
rocking her baby.
"What a wonderful temper you have!" exclaimed
Alice in admiration, "to let your husband behave like
that, without getting a bit perturbed."
"Oh, it's not patience," replied the Duchess re
signedly, "it's a matter of convenience. Neither
of iis can stand one another, so he throws things at

"Actually," said the Duchess, beating her child rath
er noisily with an egg-beater, "very little of you is
Alice; most of you is Freud, and a very dark, sinister
Freud at that!"
"But what possible good is it trying to be like Freud
inside?" complained Alice, "if I really ought to be
Alice."
"Because," replied the Duchess as she dodged the
water pitcher and an empty pepper-shaker, "no one
could understand you if you weren't; it would drive
the psychoanalysts mad if you didn't behave the way
they say you must."
"Do you mean to say," said Alice, "that people can
really tell what I'm like inside?"
"Hum!" said the Duchess, prodding the baby with
a mixing spoon to see if it were asleep or merely un
conscious, "to tell the truth they can't; however they
must make up some very interesting stories about what
they suspect goes on inside. And they have fasci
natingly suspicious, minds."
"But what possible good does it do," said Alice, who
was still slightly puzzled, "to know so much about
what goes on inside, if it's mostly all wrong?"
"Because," replied the Duchess, "even if it's wrong,

it's consistent and therefore it cr.n solve problems. It
makes it possible for the Cook and myself to realize
that although we do have a slight difference in super
ficial opinions, somewhere deep deep down we prob
ably have a common bond of great strength."
"But doesn't all this confusion have a bad effect on
your child?" asked Alice in wonderment, as she dodged
a mixing bowl and a silver soup turreen.
"No," said the Dutchess shortly, and she thrust the
baby into Alice's arms, "I should think not! It's best
for a child's character if its parents fight openly instead
of hating quietly behind one another's backs."
