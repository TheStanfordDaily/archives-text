### Elliot Epsteen 
THE OWI
Mr. Elmer Davis recently asked for 42 million dollars
to keep the OWI going. Instantly a congressional re
action set in. It is still going, and in the form of mean
ingless and derogatory platitudes. It is difficult to an
alyze because it is badly organized, both from the po
litical and the logical standpoint. However, it does
seem to be motivated by two subconscious attitudes:
1. Our enemy uses and used propaganda as a war
weapon. Therefore there must be something im
moral about it. The same argument could apply
to the armored division.
2. That for some strange reason, the enemy army
didn't race away in panic as soon as the OWI
.started broadcasting, so the agency must be only
a waste of money.
COMMENT
If this is the case, and it seems to be, judging from
the statements of the OWI opposition, certain congress
men do not realize the use of propaganda as a weapon
of war.
Propaganda is like the light mobile column in that it.
is best used to exploit a breakthrough. The light mo
bile column can bring firepower through a gap and
move so fast that it can paralyze enemy movement and
prevent him from organizing a new line. Propaganda
can also paralyze his movement by making him doubt
that his cause has any chance, by destroying his will to
move, since movement, he can be made to think, is only
towards more lost battles. It can also destroy his base,
less spectacularly than a 500-pound bomb can demolish
an ammunition dump, but more efficiently, because it
eats into the basis of the base- morale, both military
and civilian.
WORDS ANI) DEFEAT
Obviously, American propaganda does no good when
American armies are being held or defeated. You can't
tell the enemy that he's losing the war, when tempor
arily, he is winning it. Thus, during the second Ar
dennes breakthrough, Von Rundstedt's men and their
civilian support had a morale boost, only to lose it
when the former fell back.
But a better case, to argue on, because the facts are
clearer, came during the last war. America had been
dropping pamphlets by shell fire, telling the Germans
of our troops on French soil, which were becoming
large enough to deal a crushing blow.
German morale fell. Then came Ludendorff's 1018
breakthrough, and the propaganda effect shook off. But
when that German effort culminated in the second
Marne and collapsed, a moral rot set in that Hinden
burg admitted cost him his last defences.
STRATEGIC USE
Thus propaganda is best used to exploit victories, as
is the light armored column. In using it this way, the
OWI has done a very good job.
When Italy lost battle after battle, its propaganda
overcame the terrorist discipline of the Fascist move
ment and knocked Italy out of the war.
When the OWI went to work on Germany and was
backed up by military victory, Germans surrendered
in droves instead of fighting on. The OWI probably
saved quite a few American lives in the European
theater.
When American troops pushed the Japanese army
back, OWI radio broadcasts brought this fact home
to the Japanese public, forcing the government news
agencies to start telling the truth, and bringing about
government instability, a sign of lowenirg morale in
war lime.
OWI AS A WEAPON
OWI made the major propaganda effort in all these
cases, and it won victories which, though not spectac
ular, were some of the greatest of the war. I think an
impartial congressional examination of the facts will
show this. Propaganda is not an independent war
weapon, but o*e that blends with the others. II we
grant $42,000,000 as the amount necessary to keep it
going for another fiscal year, it is, moreover, a very
cheap one, considering its importance.

breakthrough, and the propaganda effect shook off. But
when that German effort culminated in the second
Marne and collapsed, a moral rot set in that Hinden
burg admitted cost him his last defences.
STRATEGIC USE
Thus propaganda is best used to exploit victories, as
is the light armored column. In using it this way, the
OWI has done a very good job.
When Italy lost battle after battle, its propaganda
overcame the terrorist discipline of the Fascist move
ment and knocked Italy out of the war.
When the OWI went to work on Germany and was
backed up by military victory, Germans surrendered
in droves instead of fighting on. The OWI probably
saved quite a few American lives in the European
theater.
When American troops pushed the Japanese army
back, OWI radio broadcasts brought this fact home
to the Japanese public, forcing the government news
agencies to start telling the truth, and bringing about
government instability, a sign of lowenirg morale in
war lime.
OWI AS A WEAPON
OWI made the major propaganda effort in all these
cases, and it won victories which, though not spectac
ular, were some of the greatest of the war. I think an
impartial congressional examination of the facts will
show this. Propaganda is not an independent war
weapon, but o*e that blends with the others. II we
grant $42,000,000 as the amount necessary to keep it
going for another fiscal year, it is, moreover, a very
cheap one, considering its importance.
THE OWI
Mr. Elmer Davis recently asked for 42 million dollars
to keep the OWI going. Instantly a congressional re
action set in. It is still going, and in the form of mean
ingless and derogatory platitudes. It is difficult to an
alyze because it is badly organized, both from the po
litical and the logical standpoint. However, it does
seem to be motivated by two subconscious attitudes:
1. Our enemy uses and used propaganda as a war
weapon. Therefore there must be something im
moral about it. The same argument could apply
to the armored division.
2. That for some strange reason, the enemy army
didn't race away in panic as soon as the OWI
.started broadcasting, so the agency must be only
a waste of money.
COMMENT
If this is the case, and it seems to be, judging from
the statements of the OWI opposition, certain congress
men do not realize the use of propaganda as a weapon
of war.
Propaganda is like the light mobile column in that it.
is best used to exploit a breakthrough. The light mo
bile column can bring firepower through a gap and
move so fast that it can paralyze enemy movement and
prevent him from organizing a new line. Propaganda
can also paralyze his movement by making him doubt
that his cause has any chance, by destroying his will to
move, since movement, he can be made to think, is only
towards more lost battles. It can also destroy his base,
less spectacularly than a 500-pound bomb can demolish
an ammunition dump, but more efficiently, because it
eats into the basis of the base- morale, both military
and civilian.
WORDS ANI) DEFEAT
Obviously, American propaganda does no good when
American armies are being held or defeated. You can't
tell the enemy that he's losing the war, when tempor
arily, he is winning it. Thus, during the second Ar
dennes breakthrough, Von Rundstedt's men and their
civilian support had a morale boost, only to lose it
when the former fell back.
But a better case, to argue on, because the facts are
clearer, came during the last war. America had been
dropping pamphlets by shell fire, telling the Germans
of our troops on French soil, which were becoming
large enough to deal a crushing blow.
German morale fell. Then came Ludendorff's 1018
