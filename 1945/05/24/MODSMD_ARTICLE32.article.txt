Admiral Doentiz and the German psuedo Flemsberg
government were arrested yesterday by the allies and
are now considered prisoners of war. This dissolves the
last vestige ol the official Nazi government remaining
in Germany. Russia protested the existence of this gov
ernment two weeks after its formal unconditional sur
render, and hence this action terminating the Flems
herg government will better Anglo-American relations
with Russia.
Now the armies of occupation are in complete control
of the German populations and the chance to destroy
the spirit of Nazism at its source is now at last the
opportunity of the allies.
One most important move in this direction is punish
ment of the Axis war criminals, which so far has been
delayed by a disagreement between England and Am
erica over war crime trials.
Our government wishes to have an international
court conduct (he trials while the English government
prefers trial of war criminals by individual countries.
Apparently the English fear thai testimony advanced
in an international court would embarrass many people
in the English government whose relations with these
war criminals were not above reproach. Russia on the
other hand advocates swift punishment of all war crim
inals including Admiral Doenitz who was one of Hit
ler's most loyal supporters.
Undoubtedly they are to some extent ugly fact, but
it is certainly possible that these ugly facts may be
exaggerated for propaganda purposes. One may show
a picture of a hundred human bodies, and to the out
raged imagination, they become a thousand or a million
bodies, and (he few war criminals who have committed
these atrocities become to (he imagination (he enlire
German people.
Of course let it be emphasized war criminals should
be punished, but at the same time no injustice should
be done in outlaw fashion. We wish to establish the
Christian principles of freedom from fear and want
throughout the world and Germany, which is an im
portant part of the world, must be no exception.
Wherever injustice and force reigns in the world,
peace is uncertain. Now we, who believe in the value
of the individual human being must set an example
by a stern, yet just and humane, treatment of the Ger
man people. They have learned the tragic lesson of war
and hate, and if given a chance now will be capable
of learning the lessons of justice and humanity.
