With the playing of the All-Star
game today, another intramural sea
son comes to an end, a season which
was as outstanding as any other
season, but which still could not
replace intercollegiate athletics. We
feel that even Monroe, which has
done most of the dominating
through this last year, would agree
with us on that. Now we begin to
wonder if next spring quarter, when
there will probably be more men on
campus, we will see murals once
again take a subordinate place at
Stanford, a subordinate place to
track, baseball, swimming, golf, and
tennis.
Not that we want to take any
thing away from the intramural
players, for they will be the same
ones who would be leading their
teams to victory. On the contrary*
we feel that men like Doc Masdn,
Bob Rosburg, Tom Ashley, and all
the others were the ones most
hurt by the discontinuance of in
tercollegiate sports; they didn't
have a chance to prove their
worth.
But now, when we think of the
future, we cannot help but be happy.
There were many athletes who
would have been at Stanford if it
had not been for the war; there will
be many of these athletes returning.
Fordy Anderson, for instance, stated
that he intends to return to the
campus and finish out his require
ments, as well as playing basketball.
Anderson was voted as the out
standing basketball coach of the
year a few seasons back. He not
only coached his Great Lakes team,
but led them through a perfect sea
son. Fordy is the exception in only
one respect; he was so outstanding
that he received national recogni
tion. But there are many others,
who are also very talented, and who
will also return.
Then we will find Stanford at
the top. where it belongs. Then
all the Dailies will he large size;
all the sports pages will be full.
And maybe, if the loss of inter
collegiate sports has meant any
thing whatsoever, the students
will really go out and cheer their
teams on.
Maybe, and this is a very big
"maybe," when sports do come back
to Stanford they will receive the
welcome they deserve. It will b?
then, and only then, that Stanford
will have gained anything out of
the temporary lull in intercollegiate
athletics.

And maybe, if the loss of inter
collegiate sports has meant any
thing whatsoever, the students
will really go out and cheer their
teams on.
Maybe, and this is a very big
"maybe," when sports do come back
to Stanford they will receive the
welcome they deserve. It will b?
then, and only then, that Stanford
will have gained anything out of
the temporary lull in intercollegiate
athletics.
With the playing of the All-Star
game today, another intramural sea
son comes to an end, a season which
was as outstanding as any other
season, but which still could not
replace intercollegiate athletics. We
feel that even Monroe, which has
done most of the dominating
through this last year, would agree
with us on that. Now we begin to
wonder if next spring quarter, when
there will probably be more men on
campus, we will see murals once
again take a subordinate place at
Stanford, a subordinate place to
track, baseball, swimming, golf, and
tennis.
Not that we want to take any
thing away from the intramural
players, for they will be the same
ones who would be leading their
teams to victory. On the contrary*
we feel that men like Doc Masdn,
Bob Rosburg, Tom Ashley, and all
the others were the ones most
hurt by the discontinuance of in
tercollegiate sports; they didn't
have a chance to prove their
worth.
But now, when we think of the
future, we cannot help but be happy.
There were many athletes who
would have been at Stanford if it
had not been for the war; there will
be many of these athletes returning.
Fordy Anderson, for instance, stated
that he intends to return to the
campus and finish out his require
ments, as well as playing basketball.
Anderson was voted as the out
standing basketball coach of the
year a few seasons back. He not
only coached his Great Lakes team,
but led them through a perfect sea
son. Fordy is the exception in only
one respect; he was so outstanding
that he received national recogni
tion. But there are many others,
who are also very talented, and who
will also return.
Then we will find Stanford at
the top. where it belongs. Then
all the Dailies will he large size;
all the sports pages will be full.
And maybe, if the loss of inter
collegiate sports has meant any
thing whatsoever, the students
will really go out and cheer their
teams on.
Maybe, and this is a very big
"maybe," when sports do come back
to Stanford they will receive the
