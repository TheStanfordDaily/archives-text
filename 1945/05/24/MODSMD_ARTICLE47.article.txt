# 'Night Unto Night' Flays Our Society

NIGHT UNTO NIGHT, by Philip
Wylie (Farrar and Rinehart, Inc.),
pp. 372. $2.75.
Mr. Wylie is an angry man. But
after reading "Generation of Vi
pers" and then the novel at pres
ent under review, I find myself
wondering if he is not somewhat
of an actor who whips himself
to a fury for a performance every
evening. In spite of the heat and
passion in each sentence there can
be no doubt that Mr. Wylie him
self is an appreciative spectator of
the rumpus he is raising.
I do not mean to question Mr.
Wylie's sincere distaste for radio,
for scientists, for the city of Chicago
and for churches. But I question if
he is actually enraged at these
things. His simulated fury is a
method of attracting attention.
Violent Rage
A method of attracting attention
cannot be expected to act also as a
means for retaining it. Yet rage has
to be sustained, sometimes even at
the expense of clarity. The result
arouses a feeling of impatience on
the reader's part as he is too openly
made acquainted with the author's
bag of tricks.
This is not to say that Mr. Wylie's
opinions are wrong. In spite of his
unfortunate manner there is justi
fication for his diatribes. The faults
of modern society are so glaring that
any clear-sighted person, whose
self-interest does not interfere with
his view of the matter, has no diffi
culty in finding them.
Follows Ruskin
The situation in this respect has
only become more obvious since
it was first pointed out by the
nineteenth century prophets Car-
Ivle, Ruskin and Matthew Arnold.
For sheer fury that was no pose,
(hat pierced to the core of each
social evil with articulate invec
tive compared to which Mr. Wylie
seems only to stammer mildly, I
recommend Ruskin's "Fors Clavi
gera." After Ruskin, Mr. Wylie is
a pale imitation.
It is interesting to trace the con
nection between those nineteenth
century writers and Mr. Wylie.
Where in force and invective Mr.
Wylie is reminiscent of Ruskin, in
his chapters on the church he re
minds one of Matthew Arnold. The
interpolated essay on "Conviction"
that is printed inside the present
novel repeats the arguments of Ar
nold's "Literature and Dogma," and
does it in a way considerably less
urbane.

But each generation has to pro
duce its own social prophets. Today
few people read Ruskin and Mat
thew Arnold but many people read
Philip Wylie. "Autres temps, autres
moeurs." The things the Victorians
tried to correct are still with us and
Mr. Wylie in his turn and in his own
way invites us to see them in their
contemporary guise.
With a didactic purpose in mind
and openly expressed, Mr .Wylie has
written around the framework of a
ghost story. The resulting book is
an unresolved hodge-podge. The
interest of a ghost story is too in
tense to permit the delay involved
in the long harangues and sermons
to which the characters treat each
other.
Crude Characterization
The characterization is crude
and unsatisfactory. Each person
is a type. Shawn is a passionate
artist, talented, of enormous in
tuitive insight into the human re
lations of the other characters,
hence, by implication, of the same
degree of insight in his perception
of American society. lie is the
author of "A Generation of Vi
pers," drawn by himself as he
would have others see him.
represent the genus Scientist, for
which Mr. Wylie feels simultaneous
ly both fascination and repulsion.
Maddox is a clever doctor but hope
lessly literal and personally un
pleasant. Mr. Wylie clearly enjoyed
flaying him.
Su pei-man
The hero is a psychological Su
perman who has complete control
of his subconscious mind but is sub
ject to fits of epilepsy. His essential
lack of any human touch is made
apparent at the ehd of the book
when he is killed. The reader finds
himself unmoved. A happy ending
is provided by Merlin, in the form of
a psychiatrist, who unravels psy
chological kinks, with a few gratui
tous whacks at the scientists thrown
in to relieve the monotony. In all,
it is a poor novel.
But this book is more than a
novel. The essays disguised as
conversations, as extracts from a
book that the hero is reading or
as parables written by Shawn, add
nothing to the novel but a great
deal to the argument. They are so
completely dissociated from the
fiction, however, that many read
ers will regard them as bitter
medicine still retaining its original
taste despite the allowance of in
ferior jam.—Sydney Ross

Su pei-man
The hero is a psychological Su
perman who has complete control
of his subconscious mind but is sub
ject to fits of epilepsy. His essential
lack of any human touch is made
apparent at the ehd of the book
when he is killed. The reader finds
himself unmoved. A happy ending
is provided by Merlin, in the form of
a psychiatrist, who unravels psy
chological kinks, with a few gratui
tous whacks at the scientists thrown
in to relieve the monotony. In all,
it is a poor novel.
But this book is more than a
novel. The essays disguised as
conversations, as extracts from a
book that the hero is reading or
as parables written by Shawn, add
nothing to the novel but a great
deal to the argument. They are so
completely dissociated from the
fiction, however, that many read
ers will regard them as bitter
medicine still retaining its original
taste despite the allowance of in

Mr. Wylie is an angry man. But
after reading "Generation of Vi
pers" and then the novel at pres
ent under review, I find myself
wondering if he is not somewhat
of an actor who whips himself
to a fury for a performance every
evening. In spite of the heat and
passion in each sentence there can
be no doubt that Mr. Wylie him
self is an appreciative spectator of
the rumpus he is raising.
I do not mean to question Mr.
Wylie's sincere distaste for radio,
for scientists, for the city of Chicago
and for churches. But I question if
he is actually enraged at these
things. His simulated fury is a
method of attracting attention.
Violent Rage
A method of attracting attention
cannot be expected to act also as a
means for retaining it. Yet rage has
to be sustained, sometimes even at
the expense of clarity. The result
arouses a feeling of impatience on
the reader's part as he is too openly
made acquainted with the author's
bag of tricks.
This is not to say that Mr. Wylie's
opinions are wrong. In spite of his
unfortunate manner there is justi
fication for his diatribes. The faults
of modern society are so glaring that
any clear-sighted person, whose
self-interest does not interfere with
his view of the matter, has no diffi
culty in finding them.
Follows Ruskin
The situation in this respect has
only become more obvious since
it was first pointed out by the
nineteenth century prophets Car-
Ivle, Ruskin and Matthew Arnold.
For sheer fury that was no pose,
(hat pierced to the core of each
social evil with articulate invec
tive compared to which Mr. Wylie
seems only to stammer mildly, I
recommend Ruskin's "Fors Clavi
gera." After Ruskin, Mr. Wylie is
a pale imitation.
It is interesting to trace the con
nection between those nineteenth
century writers and Mr. Wylie.
Where in force and invective Mr.
Wylie is reminiscent of Ruskin, in
his chapters on the church he re
minds one of Matthew Arnold. The
interpolated essay on "Conviction"
that is printed inside the present
novel repeats the arguments of Ar
nold's "Literature and Dogma," and
does it in a way considerably less
urbane.

But each generation has to pro
duce its own social prophets. Today
few people read Ruskin and Mat
thew Arnold but many people read
Philip Wylie. "Autres temps, autres
moeurs." The things the Victorians
tried to correct are still with us and
Mr. Wylie in his turn and in his own
way invites us to see them in their
contemporary guise.
With a didactic purpose in mind
and openly expressed, Mr .Wylie has
written around the framework of a
ghost story. The resulting book is
an unresolved hodge-podge. The
interest of a ghost story is too in
tense to permit the delay involved
in the long harangues and sermons
to which the characters treat each
other.
Crude Characterization
The characterization is crude
and unsatisfactory. Each person
is a type. Shawn is a passionate
artist, talented, of enormous in
tuitive insight into the human re
lations of the other characters,
hence, by implication, of the same
degree of insight in his perception
of American society. lie is the

NIGHT UNTO NIGHT, by Philip
Wylie (Farrar and Rinehart, Inc.),
pp. 372. $2.75.
Mr. Wylie is an angry man. But
after reading "Generation of Vi
pers" and then the novel at pres
ent under review, I find myself
wondering if he is not somewhat
of an actor who whips himself
to a fury for a performance every
evening. In spite of the heat and
passion in each sentence there can
be no doubt that Mr. Wylie him
self is an appreciative spectator of
the rumpus he is raising.
I do not mean to question Mr.
Wylie's sincere distaste for radio,
for scientists, for the city of Chicago
and for churches. But I question if
he is actually enraged at these
things. His simulated fury is a
method of attracting attention.
Violent Rage
A method of attracting attention
cannot be expected to act also as a
means for retaining it. Yet rage has
to be sustained, sometimes even at
the expense of clarity. The result
arouses a feeling of impatience on
the reader's part as he is too openly
made acquainted with the author's
bag of tricks.
This is not to say that Mr. Wylie's
opinions are wrong. In spite of his
unfortunate manner there is justi
fication for his diatribes. The faults
of modern society are so glaring that
any clear-sighted person, whose
self-interest does not interfere with
his view of the matter, has no diffi
culty in finding them.
Follows Ruskin
The situation in this respect has
only become more obvious since
it was first pointed out by the
nineteenth century prophets Car-
Ivle, Ruskin and Matthew Arnold.
For sheer fury that was no pose,
(hat pierced to the core of each
social evil with articulate invec
tive compared to which Mr. Wylie
seems only to stammer mildly, I
recommend Ruskin's "Fors Clavi
gera." After Ruskin, Mr. Wylie is
a pale imitation.
It is interesting to trace the con
nection between those nineteenth
century writers and Mr. Wylie.
Where in force and invective Mr.
Wylie is reminiscent of Ruskin, in
his chapters on the church he re
minds one of Matthew Arnold. The
interpolated essay on "Conviction"
that is printed inside the present
novel repeats the arguments of Ar
nold's "Literature and Dogma," and
does it in a way considerably less
urbane.

But each generation has to pro
duce its own social prophets. Today
few people read Ruskin and Mat
thew Arnold but many people read
Philip Wylie. "Autres temps, autres
moeurs." The things the Victorians
tried to correct are still with us and
Mr. Wylie in his turn and in his own
way invites us to see them in their
