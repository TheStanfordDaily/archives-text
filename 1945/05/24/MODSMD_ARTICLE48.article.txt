# Jean Rouverol, Former Farm Student, on 'One Man's Family'
## 
### 
Former Stanford student and the
daughter of Aurania Rouverol,
Stanford Graduate who is now a
famed playwright, Jean Rouverol
portrays Betty Barbour, Jack's wife,
in "One Man's Family," heard over
the Blue Network Tuesdays at 7:30
p.m.
Miss RouveroPs first profes
sional appearance on the stage
<•31110 at the aire of 17 in one of
her mother's plays entitled, ap
propriately enough, "Growing
Pains." The girl was spotted by
Hollywood talent scouts and soon
was before the motion picture
cameras. She felt she wanted to
complete her education, however,
and after six months in pictures
she returned to graduate from the
Palo Alto High School and en
rolled at Stanford University.
After two quarters at Stanford,
however, Miss Rouverol left for
Hollywood again, to appear in "Pri
vate Worlds." She decidcd to re
main in the cinema capital and con
centrate on acting. After several
years in movies and on the stage,
she tried out for the part of Betty
in "One Man's Family" in May of
1938. Carlton E. Morse, creator of
the "Family," selected her for the
part from a field of 100 girls.
The character of Betty Barbour
has paralleled closely that of Miss
Rouverol herself from her first ap
pearance in "One Man's Family."
She says that Morse has an almost
uncanny knack of anticipating the
thoughts and actions of the people
who play the "Family" roles and in
adapting the parts to fit the person
alities of the actors.
Jean was married in 1!(.'!7 to
screenwriter Hugo Butler (who at
the time was adapting one of her

mother's plays for the screen)
and they now have two children,
both of whom were forecast and
written into the "One Man's Fam
ily" script by Morse.
She is just as devoted to her do
mestic life as Betty Barbour is to
hers. She and her husband and
their two children now live in Hol
lywood. Their family life has been
distinguished by the frequent moves
they've made from one place to an
other. But they always own their
own home, however, and think it is
something of a joke that they have
been in and out of escrow eleven
times since they have been married.
Since the responsibilities of
family life have become particu
larly exacting now that she has
two small children to care for,
she has given up practically all
her acting chores except "One
Man's Family."
For a time she was a junior
screenwriter at MGM and, though
the studio picked up her option, she
felt she had to give up a regular
writing assignment to devote the
necessary time to her home. Since
then, however, she has written an
original screen play, as yet untitled,
which she hopes will soon be bought
by one of the movie studios.
Nexl to her home play writing, and
acting, Miss Houverol's other major
interest in life is the promotion of
broader democracy in the world to
day. She takes an active part on
many committees attempting to pro
mote social and economic welfare
and justice between all the groups
of the community.

Miss RouveroPs first profes
sional appearance on the stage
<•31110 at the aire of 17 in one of
her mother's plays entitled, ap
propriately enough, "Growing
Pains." The girl was spotted by
Hollywood talent scouts and soon
was before the motion picture
cameras. She felt she wanted to
complete her education, however,
and after six months in pictures
she returned to graduate from the
Palo Alto High School and en
rolled at Stanford University.
After two quarters at Stanford,
however, Miss Rouverol left for
Hollywood again, to appear in "Pri
vate Worlds." She decidcd to re
main in the cinema capital and con
centrate on acting. After several
years in movies and on the stage,
she tried out for the part of Betty
in "One Man's Family" in May of
1938. Carlton E. Morse, creator of
the "Family," selected her for the
part from a field of 100 girls.
The character of Betty Barbour
has paralleled closely that of Miss
Rouverol herself from her first ap
pearance in "One Man's Family."
She says that Morse has an almost
uncanny knack of anticipating the
thoughts and actions of the people
who play the "Family" roles and in
adapting the parts to fit the person
alities of the actors.
Jean was married in 1!(.'!7 to
screenwriter Hugo Butler (who at
the time was adapting one of her

mother's plays for the screen)
and they now have two children,
both of whom were forecast and
written into the "One Man's Fam
ily" script by Morse.
She is just as devoted to her do
mestic life as Betty Barbour is to
hers. She and her husband and
their two children now live in Hol
lywood. Their family life has been
distinguished by the frequent moves
they've made from one place to an
other. But they always own their
own home, however, and think it is
something of a joke that they have
been in and out of escrow eleven
times since they have been married.
Since the responsibilities of
family life have become particu
larly exacting now that she has
two small children to care for,
she has given up practically all
her acting chores except "One
Man's Family."
For a time she was a junior
screenwriter at MGM and, though
the studio picked up her option, she
felt she had to give up a regular
writing assignment to devote the
necessary time to her home. Since
then, however, she has written an
original screen play, as yet untitled,
which she hopes will soon be bought
by one of the movie studios.
Nexl to her home play writing, and
acting, Miss Houverol's other major
interest in life is the promotion of
broader democracy in the world to
day. She takes an active part on
many committees attempting to pro
mote social and economic welfare
and justice between all the groups
of the community.
