# Nazis Tried To Break Czech Spirit-Popper
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
"Czechoslovakia will have a hard
fight to reestablish herself," said 'Dr.
Herbert Jan Popper, assistant profes
sor of Music and former conductor
of the Prague Opei'a House, in a re
cent interview with the Daily. "Be
fore the Nazis surrendered the coun
try they tried their best to destroy
it in body and spirit."
Their final bombs fell on the fort
ress of Terezin where thousands of
Czechoslovakian prisoners were kill
ed. They set afire the castle of Hrad
cany, long a symbol of Prague itself.
And they completely destroyed the
capitol's 14th century town hall with
its famous 15th century clock.
These were final spiteful gestures
which climaxed six years of system
atic efforts to break Czechoslovakia.
In those years the Germans have
starved the people and killed all re
sisters. They have broken up fami
lies and scattered them in prison
camps all over Europe. They have
tried to kill the youth and spirit of
the nation. They have set brother
against brother, and left a tangle of
suspicion and low morale.
Return to Prague
"For instance," Dr. Popper said, "I
had an aunt in Prague. She was a
greatly respected lady with a great
deal of property. The Nazis took her
away and sold her property very
cheaply. If she should ever return
there will be this legal problem. Who
owns the property? Did these people
buy it in good faith, or were they
being rewarded? And my aunt is
only one of a million people. How
will these disputes be settled J"
Czechoslovakia needs leadership
now; she needs it desperately. But
the Germans have wiped out the in
tclligensia; they have killed the men
who would make good mayors and
councilmen. Edouard Benes has re
turned to Czechoslovakia, but he
cannot produce a good government
from thin air. All of this will take
lime.
"A very strong Allied government
will be the solution," said Dr. Pop
per. It must make no compromises
with the Nazis; it must show no
weakness. It will have the military
strength to wipe out every Nazi nest
in the hills, and will have Czechoslo
vakian support in doing so. Sudeten
land will be the possible exception to
this, for its citizens are notoriously
pro-German.
Communism? No!
This Allied government can hold
the country together, and Czecho
slovakia will have a breathing spell
to gather its own leaders. Some of
them escaped before the Nazis
marched in. At the proper time the
Allies can give way to a well pre
pared Czechoslovakian government.
"There is some talk of Communism
in Czechoslovakia," Dr. Popper con
tinued. "This is wrong. Hie Russians
helped liberate us, and there is a
strong Slavic bond between the two
peoples. But we are a property lov
ing people just like the Americans.
We have a great sympathy with the
Russians, but we do not go for Com
munism. We may have strong trade
agreements with our friends the
Russians, but we will not adopt their
type of government. And they will
not impose it on us against our will.

They would not tolerate a Fascist or
semi-Fascist government in their
neighborhood (as can easily be seen
from the tenacity of the Soviets in
the Polish question) but a Democra
tic government can very well exist
next door to Russia.
Ruthenia is the exception to this
statement. It is the mountainous
country at the extreme east of
Czechoslovakia; a country of shep
herds with little farming and no in
dustry. It's people have asked to be
come a part of Greater Russia, and
Dr. Popper is sure that Czechoslo
vakia will not try to hold them.
A Strong Peopde
Czechoslovakia is emerging from a
nightmare. "But the people will not
whine," Dr. Popper predicted. "They
will work to get on their own feet,
just as the Russians did. They have
good agricultural soil and some min
erals and they will use them to best
advantage in rebuilding their coun
try.
"They will not ask for aid; but
American sympathy would mean a
great deal to them. If we in this
country try to help them, it will
speed up their rehabilitation process
tremendously."
For the Future
"If some young Americans are still
not disturbed by this tragedy 3000
miles away, let them think of this:"
Dr. Popper concluded. "What if they
had to look for the bodies of their
parents among the ruins of some
medieval fortress? What if they
could not find a grave to leave flow
ers? If they knew that feeling, they
would be more watchful.
"They would start at home in Am
erica, for there are still many Nazis
in spirit to be found, even in this
country. Wise Americans would at
tack racial discrimination, for only
if we finally achieve racial tolerance
can we be sure that such things will
never happer again."

pared Czechoslovakian government.
"There is some talk of Communism
in Czechoslovakia," Dr. Popper con
tinued. "This is wrong. Hie Russians
helped liberate us, and there is a
strong Slavic bond between the two
peoples. But we are a property lov
ing people just like the Americans.
We have a great sympathy with the
Russians, but we do not go for Com
munism. We may have strong trade
agreements with our friends the
Russians, but we will not adopt their
type of government. And they will
not impose it on us against our will.

They would not tolerate a Fascist or
semi-Fascist government in their
neighborhood (as can easily be seen
from the tenacity of the Soviets in
the Polish question) but a Democra
tic government can very well exist
next door to Russia.
Ruthenia is the exception to this
statement. It is the mountainous
country at the extreme east of
Czechoslovakia; a country of shep
herds with little farming and no in
dustry. It's people have asked to be
come a part of Greater Russia, and
Dr. Popper is sure that Czechoslo
vakia will not try to hold them.
A Strong Peopde
Czechoslovakia is emerging from a
nightmare. "But the people will not
whine," Dr. Popper predicted. "They
will work to get on their own feet,
just as the Russians did. They have
good agricultural soil and some min
erals and they will use them to best
advantage in rebuilding their coun
try.
"They will not ask for aid; but
American sympathy would mean a
great deal to them. If we in this
country try to help them, it will
speed up their rehabilitation process
tremendously."
For the Future
"If some young Americans are still
not disturbed by this tragedy 3000
miles away, let them think of this:"
Dr. Popper concluded. "What if they
had to look for the bodies of their
parents among the ruins of some
medieval fortress? What if they
could not find a grave to leave flow
ers? If they knew that feeling, they
would be more watchful.
"They would start at home in Am
erica, for there are still many Nazis
in spirit to be found, even in this
country. Wise Americans would at
tack racial discrimination, for only
if we finally achieve racial tolerance
can we be sure that such things will
never happer again."
"Czechoslovakia will have a hard
fight to reestablish herself," said 'Dr.
Herbert Jan Popper, assistant profes
sor of Music and former conductor
of the Prague Opei'a House, in a re
cent interview with the Daily. "Be
fore the Nazis surrendered the coun
try they tried their best to destroy
it in body and spirit."
Their final bombs fell on the fort
ress of Terezin where thousands of
Czechoslovakian prisoners were kill
ed. They set afire the castle of Hrad
cany, long a symbol of Prague itself.
And they completely destroyed the
capitol's 14th century town hall with
its famous 15th century clock.
These were final spiteful gestures
which climaxed six years of system
atic efforts to break Czechoslovakia.
In those years the Germans have
starved the people and killed all re
sisters. They have broken up fami
lies and scattered them in prison
camps all over Europe. They have
tried to kill the youth and spirit of
the nation. They have set brother
against brother, and left a tangle of
suspicion and low morale.
Return to Prague
"For instance," Dr. Popper said, "I
had an aunt in Prague. She was a
greatly respected lady with a great
deal of property. The Nazis took her
away and sold her property very
cheaply. If she should ever return
there will be this legal problem. Who
owns the property? Did these people
buy it in good faith, or were they
being rewarded? And my aunt is
only one of a million people. How
will these disputes be settled J"
Czechoslovakia needs leadership
now; she needs it desperately. But
the Germans have wiped out the in
tclligensia; they have killed the men
who would make good mayors and
councilmen. Edouard Benes has re
turned to Czechoslovakia, but he
cannot produce a good government
from thin air. All of this will take
lime.
"A very strong Allied government
will be the solution," said Dr. Pop
per. It must make no compromises
with the Nazis; it must show no
weakness. It will have the military
strength to wipe out every Nazi nest
in the hills, and will have Czechoslo
vakian support in doing so. Sudeten
land will be the possible exception to
this, for its citizens are notoriously
pro-German.
Communism? No!
This Allied government can hold
the country together, and Czecho
slovakia will have a breathing spell
to gather its own leaders. Some of
them escaped before the Nazis
marched in. At the proper time the
Allies can give way to a well pre

Return to Prague
"For instance," Dr. Popper said, "I
had an aunt in Prague. She was a
greatly respected lady with a great
deal of property. The Nazis took her
away and sold her property very
cheaply. If she should ever return
there will be this legal problem. Who
owns the property? Did these people
buy it in good faith, or were they
being rewarded? And my aunt is
only one of a million people. How
will these disputes be settled J"
Czechoslovakia needs leadership
now; she needs it desperately. But
the Germans have wiped out the in
tclligensia; they have killed the men
who would make good mayors and
councilmen. Edouard Benes has re
turned to Czechoslovakia, but he
cannot produce a good government
from thin air. All of this will take
lime.
"A very strong Allied government
will be the solution," said Dr. Pop
per. It must make no compromises
with the Nazis; it must show no
weakness. It will have the military
strength to wipe out every Nazi nest
in the hills, and will have Czechoslo
vakian support in doing so. Sudeten
land will be the possible exception to
this, for its citizens are notoriously
pro-German.
Communism? No!
This Allied government can hold
the country together, and Czecho
slovakia will have a breathing spell
to gather its own leaders. Some of
them escaped before the Nazis
marched in. At the proper time the
Allies can give way to a well pre
pared Czechoslovakian government.
"There is some talk of Communism
in Czechoslovakia," Dr. Popper con
tinued. "This is wrong. Hie Russians
helped liberate us, and there is a
strong Slavic bond between the two
peoples. But we are a property lov
ing people just like the Americans.
We have a great sympathy with the
Russians, but we do not go for Com
munism. We may have strong trade
agreements with our friends the
Russians, but we will not adopt their
type of government. And they will
not impose it on us against our will.

They would not tolerate a Fascist or
semi-Fascist government in their
neighborhood (as can easily be seen
from the tenacity of the Soviets in
the Polish question) but a Democra
tic government can very well exist
next door to Russia.
Ruthenia is the exception to this
statement. It is the mountainous
country at the extreme east of
Czechoslovakia; a country of shep
herds with little farming and no in
dustry. It's people have asked to be
come a part of Greater Russia, and
Dr. Popper is sure that Czechoslo
vakia will not try to hold them.
A Strong Peopde
Czechoslovakia is emerging from a
nightmare. "But the people will not
whine," Dr. Popper predicted. "They
will work to get on their own feet,
just as the Russians did. They have
good agricultural soil and some min
erals and they will use them to best
advantage in rebuilding their coun
try.
"They will not ask for aid; but
American sympathy would mean a
great deal to them. If we in this
country try to help them, it will
speed up their rehabilitation process
tremendously."
For the Future
"If some young Americans are still
not disturbed by this tragedy 3000
miles away, let them think of this:"
Dr. Popper concluded. "What if they
had to look for the bodies of their
parents among the ruins of some
medieval fortress? What if they
could not find a grave to leave flow
ers? If they knew that feeling, they
would be more watchful.
"They would start at home in Am
erica, for there are still many Nazis
in spirit to be found, even in this
country. Wise Americans would at
tack racial discrimination, for only
if we finally achieve racial tolerance
can we be sure that such things will
never happer again."

fight to reestablish herself," said 'Dr.
