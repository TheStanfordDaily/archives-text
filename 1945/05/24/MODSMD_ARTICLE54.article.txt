# Molotov, Stanford Carillon, Topics of 'New Yorker' Pun; Lawson Describes Chimes
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
Molotov's visit to Stanford sev
eral weeks ago precipitated a short
paragraph, concerning the Hoover
Tower carillon, into the pages of the
May 19 "New Yorker":
"Incidental intelligence: When
Molotov visited Stanford Univer
sity during his slay in San Fran*
cisco, the "Internationale" was
played in his honor on Ihe Hoo
ver Memorial Chimes. At the same
time, here in New York, the ham
mer and sickle was Hying over the
Union League Cluh, along with
other United Nations.
Explaining the "New Yorker"
quotation, James R. Lawson, Hoo
ver Tower carillonneur, said, "Al
though the Russians have an
nounced the abolition of the Third
International, and have renounced
all international aspects of Com
munism including the hammer and
sickle flag and their revolutionary
song, the 'Internationale's' music is
much better than the new Russian
national anthem. I am sure that
Mr. Molotov didn't mind hearing
the 'Internationale' on our carillon."
Studied under Marriott
Formerly the assistant carillon
neur at the University of Chicago,
where he graduated in June, 1941,
Mr. Lawson learned to play the

carillon from Frederick Marriott,
the university's carillonneur. "In
learning how to play a carillon,"
Lawson said, "one should be able to
play an organ because both involve
a large amount of pedal manipula
tion."
"A good definition of a carillon
neur," he said, "is a person who is
a ballet dancer, ju-jitsu artist, and
musician, for his is an art utilizing
the entire body."
Belgium's Gift
The Belgian-American Educational
Foundation presented the carillon
as a gift to Stanford on behalf of
Belgian universities and educational
foundations. These institutions were
the recipients of endowment funds
from the Commission for Relief in
Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover
during the dark days of the World
War.
Carillons aren't to be found every
where, for only twenty-four of the
forty-eight states have them. Two
are on the Pacific coast: Stanford's
and Grace Cathedral's in San Fran
cisco.
What Did You Expect? Chimes?
"Carillons," Lawson continued,
J "should not be confused with chimes
because the former are chromatic in
their intervals, or are played by
half-tcnes, while the chimes pro
ceed by whole tones, or are diatonic,
j An example of chimes is that of
the twelve bells on the 307-foot
tower at the University of Califor
nia.
"Grace Cathedral's carillon is op
! erated electrically by keys and,
while an electric carillon is easy to
j play, it enables one to I'ealize only
j a fraction of its potentialities be
cause there is no control over the
j dynamics and tone shadings. Only a
few bells can be played at the same
! time in an electric carillon because
they are all sounded at the same
! volume, the bass bells drowning out
j the treble bells.
; Stanford's One of Best
"While Stanford has fewer bells
| than Grace Cathedral, the location

of the Stanford carillon is far supe
rior and much better than most
carillons in this country. There are,
I moreover, no apartment houses or
other obstructions around the Hoo
ver Tower.
"The Hoover carillon consists of
35 bells having a total range of three
octaves. The weight of these bells
ranges from 15V2 pounds to over
1500 pounds. Wires connect each
bell with individual wooden levers
which are struck with the clenched
hand. A great variety of compli
cated effects is possible.
Other Famous Carillons
Mr. Lawson compared three other
famous carillons with Stanford's.
"The Singing Tower in Mountain
Lake Sanctuary, Lake Wales, Flor
ida, has 61 bells with a range of
four octaves. The heaviest bell
weighs 24,000 pounds.
"Riverside Church in New York
City has 72 bells possessing a six-
I octave range. The weight of the
heaviest bell is 40,000 pounds."
The third carillon is in the Rocke
feller Chapel at the University of
Chicago where Mr. Lawson was as
sistant carillonneur. "The 207-foot
tower contains 72 bells ranging from
lOV2 pounds to 36,926 pounds and
covering six octaves.
Another One for Pacific Coast
"The existence of a possible third

carillon on the Pacific Coast has
been rumored to be located at the
Hearst Estate at San Simeon. This
carillon may have been disposed of
through Gimbles' Department Store
in New York City when some of the
Hearst art treasures were sold.
"In the Mission Inn at Riverside,
California, is a fourth pseudo-caril
lon built by the J. C. Deagan Com
pany, manufacturers of door bells.
Their product consists of elongated
vibrating tin cans which can be am
plified from church belfries. The
Deagan Company incorrectly names
these tin cans "carillons."
Stay 500 Feet Away
Referring to the Stanford carillon,
Mr. Lawson said, "The carillon re
citals are best heard from a dis
tance of at least 500 feet, for the
j secondary tones will blur at a closer
i range. An ideal spot for listening is
the Frost Amphitheater, especially
when there is a favorable west wind.
Air currents and changes of tem
perature curve and deflect sound
waves besides varying the pitch."
Mr. Lawson concluded the inter
view by saying that several special
recitals had been played in honor
of visiting delegates from San Fran
cisco on the campus. Belgian, Rus
sian, and South American delegates
have listened to songs of their coun
tries played on the Stanford carillon.

"While Stanford has fewer bells

of the Stanford carillon is far supe

carillons in this country. There are,
I moreover, no apartment houses or

"The Hoover carillon consists of
35 bells having a total range of three
octaves. The weight of these bells
ranges from 15V2 pounds to over
1500 pounds. Wires connect each
bell with individual wooden levers
which are struck with the clenched
hand. A great variety of compli
cated effects is possible.
Other Famous Carillons
Mr. Lawson compared three other
famous carillons with Stanford's.
"The Singing Tower in Mountain
Lake Sanctuary, Lake Wales, Flor
ida, has 61 bells with a range of
four octaves. The heaviest bell
weighs 24,000 pounds.
"Riverside Church in New York
City has 72 bells possessing a six-
I octave range. The weight of the
heaviest bell is 40,000 pounds."
The third carillon is in the Rocke
feller Chapel at the University of
Chicago where Mr. Lawson was as
sistant carillonneur. "The 207-foot
tower contains 72 bells ranging from
lOV2 pounds to 36,926 pounds and
covering six octaves.
Another One for Pacific Coast
"The existence of a possible third

carillon on the Pacific Coast has
been rumored to be located at the
Hearst Estate at San Simeon. This
carillon may have been disposed of
through Gimbles' Department Store
in New York City when some of the
Hearst art treasures were sold.
"In the Mission Inn at Riverside,
California, is a fourth pseudo-caril
lon built by the J. C. Deagan Com
pany, manufacturers of door bells.
Their product consists of elongated
vibrating tin cans which can be am
plified from church belfries. The
Deagan Company incorrectly names
these tin cans "carillons."
Stay 500 Feet Away
Referring to the Stanford carillon,
Mr. Lawson said, "The carillon re
citals are best heard from a dis
tance of at least 500 feet, for the
j secondary tones will blur at a closer
i range. An ideal spot for listening is
the Frost Amphitheater, especially
when there is a favorable west wind.
Air currents and changes of tem
perature curve and deflect sound
waves besides varying the pitch."
Mr. Lawson concluded the inter
view by saying that several special
recitals had been played in honor
of visiting delegates from San Fran
cisco on the campus. Belgian, Rus
sian, and South American delegates
have listened to songs of their coun
tries played on the Stanford carillon.
Molotov's visit to Stanford sev
eral weeks ago precipitated a short
paragraph, concerning the Hoover
Tower carillon, into the pages of the
May 19 "New Yorker":
"Incidental intelligence: When
Molotov visited Stanford Univer
sity during his slay in San Fran*
cisco, the "Internationale" was
played in his honor on Ihe Hoo
ver Memorial Chimes. At the same
time, here in New York, the ham
mer and sickle was Hying over the
Union League Cluh, along with
other United Nations.
Explaining the "New Yorker"
quotation, James R. Lawson, Hoo
ver Tower carillonneur, said, "Al
though the Russians have an
nounced the abolition of the Third
International, and have renounced
all international aspects of Com
munism including the hammer and
sickle flag and their revolutionary
song, the 'Internationale's' music is
much better than the new Russian
national anthem. I am sure that
Mr. Molotov didn't mind hearing
the 'Internationale' on our carillon."
Studied under Marriott
Formerly the assistant carillon
neur at the University of Chicago,
where he graduated in June, 1941,
Mr. Lawson learned to play the

carillon from Frederick Marriott,
the university's carillonneur. "In
learning how to play a carillon,"
Lawson said, "one should be able to
play an organ because both involve
a large amount of pedal manipula
tion."
"A good definition of a carillon
neur," he said, "is a person who is
a ballet dancer, ju-jitsu artist, and
musician, for his is an art utilizing
the entire body."
Belgium's Gift
The Belgian-American Educational
Foundation presented the carillon
as a gift to Stanford on behalf of
Belgian universities and educational
foundations. These institutions were
the recipients of endowment funds
from the Commission for Relief in
Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover
during the dark days of the World
War.
Carillons aren't to be found every
where, for only twenty-four of the
forty-eight states have them. Two
are on the Pacific coast: Stanford's
and Grace Cathedral's in San Fran
cisco.
What Did You Expect? Chimes?
"Carillons," Lawson continued,
J "should not be confused with chimes
because the former are chromatic in
their intervals, or are played by
half-tcnes, while the chimes pro
ceed by whole tones, or are diatonic,
j An example of chimes is that of
the twelve bells on the 307-foot
tower at the University of Califor
nia.
"Grace Cathedral's carillon is op

tance of at least 500 feet, for the
j secondary tones will blur at a closer

the Frost Amphitheater, especially

Mr. Lawson concluded the inter

recitals had been played in honor
of visiting delegates from San Fran
cisco on the campus. Belgian, Rus
sian, and South American delegates
have listened to songs of their coun
tries played on the Stanford carillon.
Molotov's visit to Stanford sev
eral weeks ago precipitated a short
paragraph, concerning the Hoover
Tower carillon, into the pages of the
May 19 "New Yorker":
"Incidental intelligence: When
Molotov visited Stanford Univer
sity during his slay in San Fran*
cisco, the "Internationale" was
played in his honor on Ihe Hoo
ver Memorial Chimes. At the same
time, here in New York, the ham
mer and sickle was Hying over the
Union League Cluh, along with
other United Nations.
Explaining the "New Yorker"
quotation, James R. Lawson, Hoo
ver Tower carillonneur, said, "Al
though the Russians have an
nounced the abolition of the Third
International, and have renounced
all international aspects of Com
munism including the hammer and
sickle flag and their revolutionary
song, the 'Internationale's' music is
much better than the new Russian
national anthem. I am sure that
Mr. Molotov didn't mind hearing
the 'Internationale' on our carillon."
Studied under Marriott
Formerly the assistant carillon
neur at the University of Chicago,
where he graduated in June, 1941,
Mr. Lawson learned to play the

carillon from Frederick Marriott,
the university's carillonneur. "In
learning how to play a carillon,"
Lawson said, "one should be able to
play an organ because both involve
a large amount of pedal manipula
tion."
"A good definition of a carillon
neur," he said, "is a person who is
a ballet dancer, ju-jitsu artist, and
musician, for his is an art utilizing
the entire body."
Belgium's Gift
The Belgian-American Educational
Foundation presented the carillon
as a gift to Stanford on behalf of
Belgian universities and educational
foundations. These institutions were
the recipients of endowment funds
from the Commission for Relief in
Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover
during the dark days of the World
War.
Carillons aren't to be found every
where, for only twenty-four of the
forty-eight states have them. Two
are on the Pacific coast: Stanford's
and Grace Cathedral's in San Fran
cisco.
What Did You Expect? Chimes?
"Carillons," Lawson continued,
J "should not be confused with chimes
because the former are chromatic in
their intervals, or are played by
half-tcnes, while the chimes pro
ceed by whole tones, or are diatonic,
j An example of chimes is that of
the twelve bells on the 307-foot
tower at the University of Califor
nia.
"Grace Cathedral's carillon is op
! erated electrically by keys and,
while an electric carillon is easy to
j play, it enables one to I'ealize only
j a fraction of its potentialities be
cause there is no control over the
j dynamics and tone shadings. Only a
few bells can be played at the same
! time in an electric carillon because
they are all sounded at the same
! volume, the bass bells drowning out
j the treble bells.
; Stanford's One of Best
"While Stanford has fewer bells
| than Grace Cathedral, the location

of the Stanford carillon is far supe
rior and much better than most
carillons in this country. There are,
I moreover, no apartment houses or
other obstructions around the Hoo
ver Tower.
"The Hoover carillon consists of
35 bells having a total range of three
octaves. The weight of these bells
ranges from 15V2 pounds to over
1500 pounds. Wires connect each
bell with individual wooden levers
which are struck with the clenched
hand. A great variety of compli
cated effects is possible.
Other Famous Carillons
Mr. Lawson compared three other
famous carillons with Stanford's.
"The Singing Tower in Mountain
Lake Sanctuary, Lake Wales, Flor
ida, has 61 bells with a range of
four octaves. The heaviest bell
weighs 24,000 pounds.
"Riverside Church in New York
City has 72 bells possessing a six-
I octave range. The weight of the
heaviest bell is 40,000 pounds."
The third carillon is in the Rocke
feller Chapel at the University of
Chicago where Mr. Lawson was as
sistant carillonneur. "The 207-foot
tower contains 72 bells ranging from
lOV2 pounds to 36,926 pounds and
covering six octaves.
Another One for Pacific Coast
"The existence of a possible third

carillon on the Pacific Coast has
been rumored to be located at the
Hearst Estate at San Simeon. This
carillon may have been disposed of
through Gimbles' Department Store
in New York City when some of the
Hearst art treasures were sold.
"In the Mission Inn at Riverside,
California, is a fourth pseudo-caril
lon built by the J. C. Deagan Com
pany, manufacturers of door bells.
Their product consists of elongated
vibrating tin cans which can be am
plified from church belfries. The
Deagan Company incorrectly names
these tin cans "carillons."
