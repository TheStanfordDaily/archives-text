# Chaparral's Esquire Edition Out Next Week
## 
### 
Inspired by Esquire and crcated
by the Chappies, the 40-page
Chaparral will appear for sale on
the Quad some time next week,
according to Old Boy Dick Dris
coll.
Every character from the fa
mous pages of Esquire—from the
Kentucky mountain boys to the
Varga gill—will be introduced to
Stanford by Chappie artists.
Price of the magazine has been
raised to 35 cents to pay the costs
of duplicating Art Lites' water
color of the bomber Mary Alice,
the two-page color photo of the
queen, and the four-color cover
of the Old Boy and Esky, the
little man from the covers of Es
"lt's only temporary, but it's
worth it."
