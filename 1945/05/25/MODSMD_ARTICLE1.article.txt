### 
LONDON, May 24 (UP). —Hangman Heinrich Himmler, chief
of the dread German Gestapo and symbol of all that was bestial in
Nazism, committed suicide by poison last night, stripped naked
but for his socks. He took the lethal dose at a villa in Lueneburg
in northwestern Germany even as a British army doctor was
searching him for the poison.
Himmler had been captured in disguise Monday by two Brit
ish guards at Bremervoerde. He was taken to British army head
quarters at Lueneburg wearing his underwear and socks and with
a blanket wrapped about him, and confined in a villa.
The doctor was searching Himmler minutely. He put two
fingers in Himmler's mouth. Himmler bit down on the doctor's
fingers and a tiny blue phial of cyanide of potassium he was
concealing in his mouth. Fifteen minutes later he was dead.
