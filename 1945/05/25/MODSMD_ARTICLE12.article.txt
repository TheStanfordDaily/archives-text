# Scrap Drive Needs Help
## 
### 
Salvage, including newspapers and
waste paper, old magazines and
books, old clothing, rags, and sacks,
cardboard boxes and cartons, and all
rubber articles will be collected
from Farm living groups tomorrow
in the only scrap drive of this
quarter.
Although students are urged to
contribute all salvageable material
with the exception of tin cans par
ticular emphasis is being placed on
the collection of waste paper, ac
cording to Shirley Jamison, chair
man of the salvage committee.
The serious shrinkage in pulp
wood stocks, the greater quantities
of paper used in overseas shipments,
and the sharp increase in estimates
for the military use of paper in 1045
have made the need for salvaged
waste paper greater than ever.
The salvage will be collected in
cardboard boxes and placcd in front
of each house by the individual liv
ing group chairmen, early on Satur
day morning. It is asked, however,
that the salvage of Brannei', Roble,
Lagunita, and Union be deposited in
the rear of the residences in order
to facilitate the collection. The Sal
vation Army truck will begin its
campus-widc canvass at 0 a.m. to
thc day until the collection is corn-
Dieted.
