# Marines Break Into Naha

### United Press 
United States Marines on Okinawa bridged the Asato river
and broke into ruined Naha in force Thursday as soldiers on the
east coast made important advances in their westward drive to
join the leathernecks and cut off Shuri fortress from the south.
Japan reported that American carrier planes had attacked
Kyushu in the homeland while Tokyo's waterfront and industrial
section still blazed after the record B-29 fire raid.
Tokyo said a new task force had joined United States fleet
units off Okinawa. A great convoy was pouring reinforcements
and supplies ashore on the embattled island 360 miles from Japan,
the enemy said.
The Japanese hold on Mindanao, last important enemy strong
hold in the Philippines, was virtually wiped out. Three United
States divisions linked up along the central highway and split
the island in two.
The carrier force assault came nearly 12 hours after more
than 550 Superforts had spread great fires through Tokyo in the
heaviest air raid of the Pacific war.
China's surging offensive has cleared the entire north bank
of the Min river from Foochow to the East China Sea. In Hunan
province, the Japanese struck back against the Chinese drive and
apparently were preparing for a desperate stand to keep open
their lifeline from south to north China.
Japan struck at American shipping around Okinawa in des
perate air attacks while the battle for the 70-mile-long island went
on through its 55th day.
The Marines threw two bridges across the river bisecting
Naha. Quickly expanding their foothold inside the rubbled capi
tal, they poured strong forces into the city despite heavy enemy
artillery fire.
Leathernecks southeast of Naha were aiming at a junction
with the seventh infantry division moving westward along the
Yonabaru-Naha highway.
A broadcast by the Communist radio station at Yenan said
that three spearheads of the Chinese Communists' new Fourth
Army are converging on the suburbs of Shanghai.
