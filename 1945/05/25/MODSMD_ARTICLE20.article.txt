Cardinals' Charter
A revision in the Cardinals' char
ter changing membership and elec

tion was discussed. Submitted by
Cheri Martin Hammond and Dick
Fay ram, the revision would change
Cardinals' membership from seven
to six men and from three to four
women.
Under the revised charter new
Cardinals members would be se
lected by the president of the A.S.-
S.U., the appointed representative
from the Executive Committee, and
members of Cardinals. The names
of the nominees would then be sub
mitted to Excom for approval.
During the past two wartime
years Cardinals have met, decided
on new members, and submitted
their names to Excom for approval.
Under the old constitution, however,
Cardinals and Excom meet in a joint
session io approve members.
Excom Debates
Presenting the proposed revision,
Fayram, Cardinals president, stated
that Cardinals should be independ
ent in its selection of members; that
Cardinals, while it works for Excom,
does not work directly with it, and
therefore should be able to select
members it feels will best fit into
the organization.
Answering argument was present
ed by Excom members who said that
constitutionally Cardinals is a sub
sidiary body of Excom, the body
closest to Excom; therefore Execu
tive Committee should have an op
portunity to share in the selection
of members.
A compromise move that Cardi
nals submit a list of names, with
one or two alternates to each posi
tion, to be approved in a joint meet
ing was voted down.
Discussing the position of Cardi
nals in campus life, Excom members
suggested that election to the or
ganization was, in reality, a reward
for services given to campus ac
tivities.
Concerning recent adverse criti
cism of Cardinals, Fayram said that
any organization based on honorary
appointment is bound to get criti
cism.
The revision will be considered
further Monday night.

Cardinals, while it works for Excom,
does not work directly with it, and
therefore should be able to select
members it feels will best fit into
the organization.
Answering argument was present
ed by Excom members who said that
constitutionally Cardinals is a sub
sidiary body of Excom, the body
closest to Excom; therefore Execu
tive Committee should have an op
portunity to share in the selection
of members.
A compromise move that Cardi
nals submit a list of names, with
one or two alternates to each posi
tion, to be approved in a joint meet
ing was voted down.
Discussing the position of Cardi
nals in campus life, Excom members
suggested that election to the or
ganization was, in reality, a reward
for services given to campus ac
tivities.
Concerning recent adverse criti
cism of Cardinals, Fayram said that
any organization based on honorary
appointment is bound to get criti
cism.
The revision will be considered
further Monday night.
