# Next Chappie Goes Esquire
## 
### 
On the walls of Ed McLellan's of
fice in Ihe University Press are the
four-color displays that will high-

light the Esquire
issue of Chapar
ral — the giant
40 - page issue
Old Boy Dick
Driscoll guaran
tees is the best
ever to hatch
from the brains
of the Chappies.
Looking like
something pre
pared for a serv-

iceman's furlough, wearing a white
evening gown and a Hollywood coif
fure, the Chappie Queen will be
displayed on the center two pages.
Captain Bob Reiser spent 18 hours
of his last furlough drawing a spe
cial four-color conference cartoon
that is mounted in accurate Esquire
style. Art Lites' water-color of the
bomber Mary Alicc is another fea
ture supplementing the art work of
regular staff artists.
Driscoll luts written a story
J about the Mary Alicc — a story
i about Second Lieutenant Carl
lfoag of Burlinganic who guided
! his ship back to an English field
almost blinded by shell fragments
| in both eves.
The cover, modeled after the tra
j ditional Esquire design, features not
; only the puppet of the Old Boy
which customarily appears on Chap
pie covers, but the puppet of Esky,
the guy with a gleam ,in his oye,
that is the trademark of the national
magazine.
Virginia Burks, Joe Sher, Jim
Emerson, and Bob De Mott break
into Chappie print for the first time
with this issue—watch for it, it'll be
out soon.
