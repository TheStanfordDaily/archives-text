## HONORARY DEGREES 
### 
The question of honorary degrees has come
up lately as Stanford students saw Cal corner
ing the cream of the UNCIO crop by the simple
device of awarding the top figures honorary de
grees.
The fact is that Stanford never has and prob
ably never will award degrees for anything ex
cept definite scholastic attainments, according to
requirements. The lack of ceremonial honor to
grt.dl:; and near-greats has apparently been ov
ercome by the school as we seem to get our
share of guests without jeopardizing the mean
ing and significance of a Stanford degree.
The honorary degree is one of those things
that require two or three lemons for every real
deed it is able to honor. It is easy to see how
it can easily get to be a political and half
hearted thing, taken for granted by those who
deserve it, and with only enemies to be made
among those who do not.
By way of elucidation of this incident and
endorsement of the University policy, these
facts are self-evident.
