# FAIR PRACTICE
## 
### 
As citizens of a democracy, we should be
always on the alert for ways to make that de
mocracy more real to us than just what we
study about in Poly Sci 1, but "after all, can't
do anything about."
Such an opportunity is presented by Assem
bly Bill number three (A.B. No. 3) which has
been introduced to the present session of the
California State Assembly. This bill would
establish a State Commission for Fair Employ
ment Practices, in order to protect workers in
California against discrimination by employers
or labor unions "on account of race, color, creed,
naiional origin, or ancestry."
The biil has pushed around through several
committees since the beginning of the session
and is now in the Committee on Ways and
Means, which may bring it to the floor of the
Assembly if it wishes.
People who are interested in the passage of
this truly democratic measure can help to some
extent by sending post cards or letters to As
semblyman Albert Wallenburg (Chairman of
the Committee) or Assemblyman Raup Miller
(of Palo Alto, also on the Committee).
