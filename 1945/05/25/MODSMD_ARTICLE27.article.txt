### PEGGY FITTS 
Walking into the Periodical Room for my
weekly round v/ith the quiz in the Saturday Re
view of Literature (as soon as I pass July 13,
1043, I can go on to the next issue), I tripped
and fell flat on the personal advertisements in
the back. Advertisements of all kinds are be
ginning to acquire a dark-brown significance
for some of us who will wake up on the morn
ing of June 18th and find ourselves plunk in
the Position Wanted Column.
A quick once-over of the SRL's offerings
makes it as clear as anything that the world is
not, after all, bounded on the east by Lake Lag
unita and on the west by State Highway No.
09, and that there are all kinds of ways to make
a living. For instance:
"COLLEGE FRATERNITY MACAZINE look
ing for woman editorial assistant who is willing
to live on crust in an attic. Write C W ,
Editor, THE PHI GAMMA DELTA."
"DRIVING NEW YORK to Chicago this week
end? You relax, I'll drive." Okay.
"WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES and interests?
Write. Receive unique souvenir." Well, one
cjl my hobbies is eatingâ€”
"DASHING YOUNG BACHELOR, intelligent,
versatile, fine tastes, who enjoys life in the ab
stract, invites feminine correspondence." You
birj attractive abstract!
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! Theatrical gen
tleman wants an angel yes, an angel. This
may ring a bell inside of YOU!" Who, me?
"TEXAN, SATED with Huysmans, Huxley,
and Dali, is virtually expiring with ennui. Sug
gestions?" Did you-all ever read Winnie-the-
Pooh?
"LACK OF ENGLISH handicaps seething
brain with colorful creations. Want helper to
inject decorum required to penetrate crocodile
skinned editors." And that tor YOU, Miss G!
