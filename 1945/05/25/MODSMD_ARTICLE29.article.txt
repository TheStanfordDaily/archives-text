The slightest cracks are sometimes the first sign of
the fall of a dam, or oi the wall of a fortress, or of
the end of a campaign. They are appearing, are mul
tiplying, and are growing in size, in the structure
of the Japanese dispositions in southern China.
The enemy gained southern China in the hope of
using it as a new line of approach to Chungking, and
for the railroad to Canton which could be used to
funnel oil from the Indies. He failed in the first at
tempt, although he came quite close to succeeding in
his big drive of last year. The long Japanese naval
defense line caused all of it to be weak, and for this
reason his hold on the Indies is in danger.
LAST USE
Then the only value of his high priced corridor to
Canton was that it deprived us of a base from which
to launch a Chinese offensive. But his corridor was
dangerous, and possibly untenable.
His occupation of the southern provinces was based
on a lew roads infested with guerillas, a supply serv
ice not efficient enough to keep his armies well
stocked, and the containing of large pockets of Chi
nese on his fianks and around his coastal ports.
The Chinese made his tenure more dangerous by
covering the building of airdromes on the sides of the
corridor. A recent, abortive offensive failed in taking
these.
JAPANESE PROSPECTS
The collapse of the offensive undoubtedly showed
him that he was not capable of fighting a battle in
such an extended condition. Since there was no eco
nomic reason lor holding the corridor, why not with
draw from it?
He promptly pulled out of a stiff fight in Foochow
without putting up too much resistance. He is now
reported ready to fall back north.
His position in China is weak because his armies
were too scattered, and now he must try to concen
trate them on as strong a line of defense as pos
sible.
LENGTH OF TIIE RAWL
He might make his line around Changsha, the
starting point of his offensive. Here his right flank
would be in the almost impassible mountains north
of Chunking, his center in one of the mountains
backed by the Yangtze as a last line, and his left on
the coast.
But his sea flank, or rather the sea approach to
his left rear, is vulnerable. An army following it
would cross the open plains around Shanghai, an
excellent field for a mechanized battle.
The enemy might feel himself too weak to a
battle on both grounds, in which case he would with
draw to Manchuria. Again, he might hold both his
front line and his sea flank lightly, putting his main
forces in reserve to be thrown in whatever direction
they are needed. In this case, his front line should
rest behind the Yangtze. He would hardly want a
river that could be renedered impassible by aerial
action against its bridges, between his reserves and
his line.
Finally, he could withdraw to Manchuria alto
gether.
But the main significance of any withdrawal he
makes is that we now have a chance 1 for ground op
erations on the Asiatic mainland. The lesson of the
Pacific War so far is that he can make progress dif
ficult for us on a narrow line because of defensive
firepower.
Now he is going to have to fight on a long line,
is going to have to be able to switch his firepower to
the points at which it is needed. To that extent, it
will be a war of mechanization, and enemy strategy
for production should logically include more mechan
ized units.

His position in China is weak because his armies
were too scattered, and now he must try to concen
trate them on as strong a line of defense as pos
sible.
LENGTH OF TIIE RAWL
He might make his line around Changsha, the
starting point of his offensive. Here his right flank
would be in the almost impassible mountains north
of Chunking, his center in one of the mountains
backed by the Yangtze as a last line, and his left on
the coast.
But his sea flank, or rather the sea approach to
his left rear, is vulnerable. An army following it
would cross the open plains around Shanghai, an
excellent field for a mechanized battle.
The enemy might feel himself too weak to a
battle on both grounds, in which case he would with
draw to Manchuria. Again, he might hold both his
front line and his sea flank lightly, putting his main
forces in reserve to be thrown in whatever direction
they are needed. In this case, his front line should
rest behind the Yangtze. He would hardly want a
river that could be renedered impassible by aerial
action against its bridges, between his reserves and
his line.
Finally, he could withdraw to Manchuria alto
gether.
But the main significance of any withdrawal he
makes is that we now have a chance 1 for ground op
erations on the Asiatic mainland. The lesson of the
Pacific War so far is that he can make progress dif
ficult for us on a narrow line because of defensive
firepower.
Now he is going to have to fight on a long line,
is going to have to be able to switch his firepower to
the points at which it is needed. To that extent, it
will be a war of mechanization, and enemy strategy
for production should logically include more mechan
ized units.
The slightest cracks are sometimes the first sign of
the fall of a dam, or oi the wall of a fortress, or of
the end of a campaign. They are appearing, are mul
tiplying, and are growing in size, in the structure
of the Japanese dispositions in southern China.
The enemy gained southern China in the hope of
using it as a new line of approach to Chungking, and
for the railroad to Canton which could be used to
funnel oil from the Indies. He failed in the first at
tempt, although he came quite close to succeeding in
his big drive of last year. The long Japanese naval
defense line caused all of it to be weak, and for this
reason his hold on the Indies is in danger.
LAST USE
Then the only value of his high priced corridor to
Canton was that it deprived us of a base from which
to launch a Chinese offensive. But his corridor was
dangerous, and possibly untenable.
His occupation of the southern provinces was based
on a lew roads infested with guerillas, a supply serv
ice not efficient enough to keep his armies well
stocked, and the containing of large pockets of Chi
nese on his fianks and around his coastal ports.
The Chinese made his tenure more dangerous by
covering the building of airdromes on the sides of the
corridor. A recent, abortive offensive failed in taking
these.
JAPANESE PROSPECTS
The collapse of the offensive undoubtedly showed
him that he was not capable of fighting a battle in
such an extended condition. Since there was no eco
nomic reason lor holding the corridor, why not with
draw from it?
He promptly pulled out of a stiff fight in Foochow
without putting up too much resistance. He is now
reported ready to fall back north.
