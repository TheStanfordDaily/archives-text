Postwar political problems are beginning to emerge
in the Near East, where the French have sent their
foreign legion into Syria and Lebanon. These two
countries in recent times have been declared inde
pendent, and France has recognized their indepen
dence. However the French still have the right to
quarter troops in these countries because of an old
League of Nations mandate that has not yet expired.
The French claim that they are sending their troops
through these countries to tight Japan. The Lebanese
and Syrian ministers have broken relations with
France and have threatened to use force backed by
the Arab world to dispel the troops. The French have
been reported as insisting upon control of the armies
of these countries, which in particular is a threat
to the national sovereignty.
WHERE ATLANTIC CHARTER?
Certainly this is an expression of national aggres
sion against a weaker country quite similar to I lie
methods used by Nazi Germany, to obtain Nordic
rights; and obviously this kind of aggression is op
posed to the principles of the Atlantic Charter and
the principles for which we have fought World War If.
During prewar years imperialistic powers had been
exploiting the people of the Near East, and this pres
ent incident is but a return to prewar policy. In the
six war years much propaganda has been distributed
by the Allies to the effect that this war was being
fought for the freedom and rights of small nations,
and they were promised freedom if they would co
operate vvith the Allied cause.
In many cases the imperialistic powers were not
able to exert much influence in the Near East, es
pecially France, who was defeated by Germany, and
hence the Near Eastern countries have enjoyed great
er freedom than ever before in modern history.
They will not readily give up this freedom; for they
have taken the Allies at their word. They are willing
to fight against aggression with their lives, from what
ever quarter this threat comes, even if from those
quarters which has professed to fight for freedom.
They have learned for certain the lesson of freedom.
RISKY BUSINESS
If the French seriously attempt to exploit these na
tions a disastrous conflict will ensue, which may in
volve not only the millions of people in the Near East,
but the people of India and the Far East an well.
Very possible such incidents as these could pave the
way for the next world war. The millions of people
in China for instance have been exploited in the past
by the Western nations that profess to fight against
the spirit of aggression.
In six years they cannot have lost every vestige of
their suspicion of our intentions; and if we fail to
demonstrate our goodwill their suspicions will rise
with new vigor. The French aggression in Syria and
Lebanon is not evidence of Allied good intentions to
ward small powers and will weigh heavily upon Chi
nese opinion of us. Suspicion leads to disagreement,
and disagreement, of course, to war. Wars begin
always with little things.
Those opposed to aggression should immediately de
nounce the French action, and Allied good intentions
should be made obvious and above suspicion, or
might, otherwise, the peace may be lost.

dence. However the French still have the right to
quarter troops in these countries because of an old
League of Nations mandate that has not yet expired.
The French claim that they are sending their troops
through these countries to tight Japan. The Lebanese
and Syrian ministers have broken relations with
France and have threatened to use force backed by
the Arab world to dispel the troops. The French have
been reported as insisting upon control of the armies
of these countries, which in particular is a threat
to the national sovereignty.
WHERE ATLANTIC CHARTER?
Certainly this is an expression of national aggres
sion against a weaker country quite similar to I lie
methods used by Nazi Germany, to obtain Nordic
rights; and obviously this kind of aggression is op
posed to the principles of the Atlantic Charter and
the principles for which we have fought World War If.
During prewar years imperialistic powers had been
exploiting the people of the Near East, and this pres
ent incident is but a return to prewar policy. In the
six war years much propaganda has been distributed
by the Allies to the effect that this war was being
fought for the freedom and rights of small nations,
and they were promised freedom if they would co
operate vvith the Allied cause.
In many cases the imperialistic powers were not
able to exert much influence in the Near East, es
pecially France, who was defeated by Germany, and
hence the Near Eastern countries have enjoyed great
er freedom than ever before in modern history.
They will not readily give up this freedom; for they
have taken the Allies at their word. They are willing
to fight against aggression with their lives, from what
ever quarter this threat comes, even if from those
quarters which has professed to fight for freedom.
They have learned for certain the lesson of freedom.
RISKY BUSINESS
If the French seriously attempt to exploit these na
tions a disastrous conflict will ensue, which may in
volve not only the millions of people in the Near East,
but the people of India and the Far East an well.
Very possible such incidents as these could pave the
way for the next world war. The millions of people
in China for instance have been exploited in the past
by the Western nations that profess to fight against
the spirit of aggression.
In six years they cannot have lost every vestige of
their suspicion of our intentions; and if we fail to
demonstrate our goodwill their suspicions will rise
with new vigor. The French aggression in Syria and
Lebanon is not evidence of Allied good intentions to
ward small powers and will weigh heavily upon Chi
nese opinion of us. Suspicion leads to disagreement,
and disagreement, of course, to war. Wars begin
always with little things.
Those opposed to aggression should immediately de
nounce the French action, and Allied good intentions
should be made obvious and above suspicion, or
might, otherwise, the peace may be lost.
Postwar political problems are beginning to emerge
in the Near East, where the French have sent their
foreign legion into Syria and Lebanon. These two
countries in recent times have been declared inde
pendent, and France has recognized their indepen
dence. However the French still have the right to
