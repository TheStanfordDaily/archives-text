Hooray Cor ihe Army!
For three quarters civilians eating
at Encina Commons luive also com
plained about the abominable food
served us morning, noon, and night.
For three quarters we have punned
among ourselves about the many
rank courses and unbalanced meals.
We reiterate that although the
quality of Encina food is not up
Co par because of the war situa
tion ,it can he improved despite
the various handicaps. Certain
ly the odor and taste could he
improved to a large extent
through more careful and con
scientious cooking.
We dislike eating potatoes three
meals per day. We try to dodge
soup twice a day. We pray that we
may have fresh salads daily. We
look forward to the time that En
cina food will not be cooked to
vitamin-less pulp. In other words,
we want food that is good to eat
both in taste and in nourishment.
Serving us the food on metal
trays is not objectionable since
it has no bearing on the food's
quality and taste. Food served in
the women's halls costs approxi
mately the same as that served at
Encina, hut the differences in
quality and taste are great.
We are writing this letter with
the hope that our last days here
this quarter may be blessed with
more edible fare. Please consider
this letter to be representative of
the civilians who add their voices
to the Army's pleas for better tast
ing chow.
