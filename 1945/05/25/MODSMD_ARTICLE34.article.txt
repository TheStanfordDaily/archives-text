# Chinatown Slums Need Farm Student Workers
## 
### 
Most Stanford students have had
! their share, of chopsticks and jade
j trinkets and sightseeing tours in the
j exotic atmosphere of San Francisco's
j Chinatown, but few realize that be
hind the scenes of this tourists' par
adise exist the worst conditions in
the city as to tuberculosis rate and
substandard dwellings.
To help meet some of the human
problems that face Chinatown's
residents, the American Friends
Service Committee has selected this
j area as the site of one of its 1945
I work campsâ€”the plea is directed to
i Stanford students to join the ranks
j of workers.
Scholarships are available where
needed for the $75 expenses re
quired for the camp period, June 28
to August 18. Information may be
obtained through the American
Friends Service Committee, 18.')0
Sutter Street, San Francisco 15.
The work camp will remodel an
| old building to provide additional
j ward space for the use of elderly
patients in the overcrowded hospi
| tals, and will provide recreation
leadership in co-operation with other

community agencies.
Under the guidance of both Chi
nese and Caucasian leaders, the
campers will have an opportunity to
see the problems created by racial
discrimination first hand, to look for
ways to overcome them. The social
pressures and restrictive covenants
which are making Chinatown in
creasingly congested will be care
fully examined.
