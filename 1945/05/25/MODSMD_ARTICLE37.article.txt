# 300 Club Deserts Roble; Finds Revenge Is Sweet
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
Last night a rather peculiar group
of girls were gathered around the
Roble dining room doors. They all
had the same well-stuffed, compla
cent air and yawned as they waited
for the head hasher to let them in.
What they lacked was the humble
touch of the 300 Club, but they were
too bored to even notice that any
thing was wrong.
Curtain Goes Up
Then the doors opened—. At the
rear of each dining room was an
enormous formal announcement,
saying, "The 300 Club Announces
Its First Annual Banquet—YUK!"
All the walls were covered with
pictures of cretinish people and signs
saying, "Where the Elite Don't Meet
to Eat," "Guess Where We Are?"
and "299—P00r Girl!"
They looked a bit sad as they sat
down at their tables. Ever since
they'd drawn numbers below 300 in
the room drawings, they'd bullied
the 300 Club with the aid of whips
and clubs—but now they feared they
were faced with revolt. They snarled
as they looked at the empty place
at each table. There was a place
card with some 300 number at each
of these places.
After You've Gone
The climax came when announce
ments were made .around dessert
time. This was it—"The 300 Club
sends its regrets. It will not be
able to attend dinner tonight."

All this time, the newly unshack
led members of the 300 Club were
eating hamburgers in front of a bar
becue pit on Portola Road. Their
eager little faces bore doglike ex
pressions of gratitude, and they
woofed gently as they spread more
mustard on their hamburgers. They
had sneaked!
Long Way Home
After eating, they played ball,
sang, and then packed up and head
ed back toward the campus.
They stopped in front of Roble
and started what appeared to be a
serenade. By the time the bitter
faces of the "non-belongers" had
poked out of their windows to listen*
the music stopped, and 300 Club
yells began.
