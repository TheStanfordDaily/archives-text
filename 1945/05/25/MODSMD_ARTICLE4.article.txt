WASHINGTON, May 24 (UP).—War Production Chief J. A.
Krug today declared another liguor holiday for distillers during
July, and estimated that 48 million gallons of beverage alcohol
would be turned out.
He said, however, that he was "not sure yet" whether whisky
manufacturers would be permitted to use corn. If corn is used
bourbon would be among spirits flowing from the distilleries.
