half of the ninth inning when Alsap
scored on Rosburg's fly to right field.
Monroe Gets Two
In the last half of the third, Rio
Supple laid down a beautifully ex
ecuted bunt and beat it out for a
hit. Reische walked and Alsap lined
one to third, Ashley's throw to the
plate was wide and two runs scored.
The "Stars" got one run back in the
top half of the fourth when Pitts
and Hood got on base on errors and
Mason, who finally overcame the
jinx that Monroe held over him,
drilled a single into right scoring
Hood.
From the fourth inning till the
ninth the game was a tight pitchers'
battle and strikeouts were plentiful,
Sher whiffing ten batters, and Pitts
striking out nine. Said one player,
"The only way to hit Luke or Joe
is to step out in front of the plate
and meet the ball before it starts to
rise, but just try and do it."
Mason Comes Through
In their half of the ninth the All -
Stars knotted the count when Hood
walked to open the inning and stole
second and went to third on a passed
ball. After two were out Mason
again came through with a timely
single into left field. Monroe, how
ever prevented the tussle from go

ing into extra sessions, when Alsap
reached first on an error, and was
advanced to third on a single by
Bechter. Rosburg then knocked a
high fly to right field and Alsap
tagged up to score the winning run.
By virtue of their triumph, Mon
roe will tackle the champions of the
Dibble Hospital league in a game to
be pliiyed soon. The All-Stars will
again appear in the game against
the ASTars in a game to be played
next Wednesday at G:45 on the Sun

half of the ninth inning when Alsap
scored on Rosburg's fly to right field.
Monroe Gets Two
In the last half of the third, Rio
Supple laid down a beautifully ex
ecuted bunt and beat it out for a
hit. Reische walked and Alsap lined
one to third, Ashley's throw to the
plate was wide and two runs scored.
The "Stars" got one run back in the
top half of the fourth when Pitts
and Hood got on base on errors and
Mason, who finally overcame the
jinx that Monroe held over him,
drilled a single into right scoring
Hood.
From the fourth inning till the
ninth the game was a tight pitchers'
battle and strikeouts were plentiful,
Sher whiffing ten batters, and Pitts
striking out nine. Said one player,
"The only way to hit Luke or Joe
is to step out in front of the plate
and meet the ball before it starts to
rise, but just try and do it."
Mason Comes Through
In their half of the ninth the All -
Stars knotted the count when Hood
walked to open the inning and stole
second and went to third on a passed
ball. After two were out Mason
again came through with a timely
single into left field. Monroe, how
ever prevented the tussle from go

ing into extra sessions, when Alsap
reached first on an error, and was
advanced to third on a single by
Bechter. Rosburg then knocked a
high fly to right field and Alsap
tagged up to score the winning run.
By virtue of their triumph, Mon
roe will tackle the champions of the
Dibble Hospital league in a game to
be pliiyed soon. The All-Stars will
again appear in the game against
the ASTars in a game to be played
next Wednesday at G:45 on the Sun
