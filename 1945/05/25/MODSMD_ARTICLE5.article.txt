## 
### 
A( the meeting of the Y.W.C.A.
World Affairs Group yesterday af
ternoon, Raden Musa Djubcna, an
adviser to the Dutch delegation of
the United Nations Conference,
spoke ofl-the-record of some of the

developments of the trusteeship
committee of the Conference. Mr.
Musa, who is a Javanese, is work
ing with this committee, whose
chairman is Prime Minister Frazer
of New Zealand.

Following the remarks of Mr. Mu-
J sa, Dr. Felix Keesing, professor of
anthropology, outlined some of the
problems which have confronted the
members of the delegation in con
nection with the question of inter
national trusteeships of dependent
nations.
Colonial Reactionaries
As background for the discussion,
Dr. Keesing pointed out that there
has been a growing reaction among
many colonial peoples against what
they consider domination and ex
ploitation on the part of the ruling
power. This has led to an increase
of nationalism in many colonies
which may lead to armed revolt in
the future.
Mot Springs Institute
The conflict between colonial and
i non-colonial powesr was well illus
trated at the Institute of Pacific Re
lations held at Hot Springs, which
Dr. Keesing attended. In general,
the non-colonial powers, especially
Canada and China, were very out-
I spoken in their demands for frec
| dom for colonial peoples. On the
. opposite side of the fence the Brit
-1 ish and French deletages defended

the possession of colonies and stated
that the other nations did not un
derstand the problems of colonial
administration.

The representatives from the
United States were much divided in
their opinion seemed to hold the
balance of power in the controversy.
Machinery Only!
The speaker also pointed out that
I the United Nations Conference was
concerned only with the setting up
of machinery to deal with the prob
lem of trusteeships and was not
, concerned with making any deci
sions at the present. If a satisfactory
' agreement can be worked out and
approved by the San Francisco Con
ference. the problem of international
trusteeships can be solved after the
nations involved can more clearly
realize their international obliga
tions.
