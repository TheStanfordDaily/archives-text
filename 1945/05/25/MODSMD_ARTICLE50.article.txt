# Tallulah Takes Russians By Storm--'It's a Scandal'
## 
### 
It was just as well Molotov left
j San Francisco before he got a
| glimpse of M.G.M.'s "A Royal Scan-

dal — what is
happening at the
Stanford to poor
Catherine the
Great would be
enough to make
Russia ask for G
votes in the As
sembly.
But whatever
point of view of
the Russians, "A
Royal Scandal"

is amusing comedy with Tullulah
Bankhead as a fickle and wholly
feminine Catherine who liked her
men in white uniforms—and many
I of them.

William Eythe—the white uniform
! ''A Royal Scandal" revolved around

I —was wholly credible as the inno
cent abroad who strayed into Cath
erine's orbit. As a matter of fact,
he was about the only one who
played his part "straight."
Return of Mr. Dingle
Charles Coburn, another "Mr.
Dingle" in gold braid, puttered in
and out of court and boudoir scenes
with equal composure and the usual
chuckles in his wake. As the gouty
chancellor, his "man to man" talks
with Empress Catherine after the
formalities were over stole every
scene he lumbered across.
The plot wove a tangled course—
frankly a vehicle for ofT-thc-record
remarks. It started out with a rev
olutionary plot designed to put one
general's nephew in the uniform of
the commander of the palace guards.
But the nephew wanted to go home
to the Ural Mountains. William
Eythe, who apparently didn't, took
over.
Eythe came as a lieutenant and
went up one notch at each glass of
champagne. The only person who
was worried about Russia, he was
definitely bush league batting in big
league.
Coupled with "A Royal Scandal"
was 'Pan-America"—equally plot
less but held together by the good
looks of Philip Terry. There were
so many South American songs that
people strolled out of the theater in
Conga formation.
Songs and straight scenes alter
nated in rapid succession until it left
the audience feeling they had been
caught in a mix-master. The danc
ing was at times too good to be lost
in the maze. Apparently Hollywood
has too many South American acts
and decided to give them all a
chance in one movie.
Plot Sickens
The story was the usual hard-to
get man trapped-by-sweet-sincere
girl opus. It sounded like something
from the Ladies' Home Journal but
it was pleasanf escapism.
Filled to capacity—and over—with
pseudo Carmen Mirandas, "Pan
americana" had Robert Benchley,
who always more than fills any gap.
