# Jap Relocation Centers Offer Summer Jobs
## 
### 
Japanese - Americans — 55,000 of
them—are preparing to leave relo
cation centers for return to their
homes or to comparatively strange
areas near the Pacific Coast. From
the time the centers' schools per
manently close down on June 11, to
December 31 when all of these res
idents must find new homes, will be
the most difficult period of transi
tion.
Group leadership and interpreta
tion of life outside the centers will
be needed in this period; students
of Stanford are being offered the
opportunity not only to serve this
minority group but to learn first
hand its problems.
Scholarships Offered
Because the Stanford Y.W.C.A. is
particularly interested in this proj
ect, men and women students who
desire to work but will need finan
cial aid (costs are $40 per month)
are asked to see Miss Pat Davidson
at the "Y" offices for information on
scholarships. The "Y" will sponsor
any student who is particularly
suited to this work, according to
Miss Davidson.
A training conference will be held
in Los Angeles on June 29 and 30,
after which workers will be placed
in the Poston and Gila River relo
cation centers in Arizona for the
period from July 1 to August 31—
all or a part of this time.
Students Recruited
Stanford students — especially
those possessing special skills or
who have had leadership experi
ence—would be especially welcome
for work on the project, according
to Miss Davidson, Y.W.C.A. execu
tive secretary at Stanford.
Athletics, boys' and girls' clubs,
vacation Bible schoo si,ward assist
ance in hospitals, arts and crafts,
playground activities, nursery
schools, dramatics, music and danc
ing are on the list of suggested
work projects at the centers.
How It's Done
Three types of arrangement are
possible for the student who is in
terested in spending his vacation at
one of the relocation areas—volun
teer work, with a minimum of $40
monthly for expenses; schoalrship
aid from a denominational board or
other agency; regular employment
by the War Relocation Authority
(requirements: two years of college
and special skill in a job listed
above).
Those interested in this work may
find further information at the cam
pus Y.W.C.A. offices, or by writing

retary, Room 1110, 715 South Hope
Street, Los Angeles 14, California.

ect.
