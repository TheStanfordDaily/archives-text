# Casas Hold Party To Honor Hashers
## 
### 
In honor of their hashers Lagunita
held a party last night. Barbara
Brooks was chairman of the affair.
A special song to the hashers, writ
ten by Peggy Fitts, was sung by
the following quartette: Ellie Brill,
Eloise Engle, Pat McCorriston, and
Gloria Andesron.
Ice cream cones were served on
the terrace as a treat instead of the
regular dessert. After dinner the
Naranja volleyball team, champions
of the iriter-casa tournament, chal
lenged the hashers to a game which
the hashers won.
