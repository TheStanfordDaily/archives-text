Pago 37 of the Bawlout reads "Mitchell, John Pearce (Adm. 164), Reg
istrar, Professor of Chemistry, and Director of Basic Unit, Army Special
ized Training Program."
But it doesn't say anything abo uthte tall, gray-haired man in the of
fices at the foot of the stairs of the Ad Building who, between committee

meetings at 4 p.m. sharp and count
less interviews with befuddled stu
dents, manages to administer very
efficiently the complicated affairs of
some 3,000 Farm students.
Empty Boxes in the Old IVO.
Never again, however, will future
Stanford hopefuls receive various
notices throughout the summer
signed "J. P. Mitchell, Registrar,"
because at the end of this quarter
Dr. Mitchell will retire after 40
years at Stanford.
He came to Palo Alto in 1896 and
graduated with the class of '03 from
Stanford. He began teaching here in
1905 and worked up through various
instructorships and associate! profes
sorships to a professor of chemistry.
He has been Registrar since 1925.
When asked if he was here during
the earthquake Dr. Mitchell grinned
and replied, "Very much so, I'm
afraid"; but when asked further de
tails he protested that it was all
old stull to most students.
Men—Going Up!!
"The pre-war ratio of two men to
one woman will return gradually,"
said Mr. Mitchell. "The post-war
registration will never be more than
4,000 to 4,500. however, unless the
University builds more dormitories.
When the men take over Branner
again year after next, fewer women
will be admitted to the Univesrity."
Dr. Mitchell has made no plans yet
as to what he will do when he
retires. His successor will be an-
I nounced in the near future.
