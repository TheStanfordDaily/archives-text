# 'Merry Wives' Receives Bouquets on First Night
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
The Stanford Playcsr have done it
again! And this time it was in their
production of Otto Nicolai's comic
opera, "The Merry Wives of Wind
sor," which they presented to a
first-night audience last night. Bou
quets to them and to co-workers in
the Division of Music for a betlcr
than-first-rate student production.
Just exactly whom to begin with
in handing out the plaudits for the
opera is a little difficult to decide.
The plot concerns the efforts of a
fat, old gay blade to flirt with two
wives (not his) at the same time.
The wives (Mistresses Page and
Ford) discover the scheme, and plot
right back again to get even with
the old man.
The result is a gay, rollicking—
if not too logical—performance all
the way through. Ami the singers
treated it as such. Stanford stu
dent Bruce Stewart played the
lead role of Sir John Falstaff, the
old man, and Lois Hartzcll and
Beta Popper were Mistresses Ford
and Page respectively.
The latter two easily gain credit
for the most outstanding perform
ances coupled with the fact that
they had the longest roles. Miss
Hartzell's humorous, lilting soprano
and her wonderful flair for drama
made her perfect for the role of the
scheming Mrs. Ford. Her coy flirta
tions with Falstaff. and her alterca
tion with her jealous husband,
played by Edward Wellman, were
some of the best scenes in the opera.
Mrs. Popper, too, must carry off
her share of praise. Although her
role was somewhat smaller than
Miss Hartzell's, she played it with
an intelligent and gay under
standing. Her voice, too, was ex
cellent and blended beautifully
with Miss Hartzell's and the rest
of the cast.
Space does not permit this re
viewer to give as much attention to
the the rest of the cast as they de
serve. Bruce Stewart, although
slightly ill at case, sang beautifully,
and his scenes provided some of the
best comedy in the play.
Pet of (he audience was 15. Q.
Morgan in the role of Slender,
the ridiculous suitor of Mistress
Page's daughter, Anne. lie, with
the other disappointed suitor, Dr.
Cans (Ilarlcn Adams), sent the
audience into laughter every time

(hey came on the stage. The lov
ers, Anne (Losi Sini(h) and Fen
ton (Joseph Tissier), had smaller
parts than the others, hut they
sang very well and played con
vincingly. Miss Smith's soprano
was particularly good.
Edward Wellman (Mr. Ford) was
one of the best in the very-good
cast, with his voicc and acting bet
ter than most. And last but not
least, Jack Taylor (Mr. Page), in
his first opcratic role at Stanford,
more than acquitted himself.
The orchestra, under the direction
of Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, is to
be commended for a fine perform
ance, and scenery, costumes, and
lighting were professional. The cho
rus, too, was first rate, and better
than some we've seen in profession
al musicals. But for a thorough ap
preciation of what the entire cast
and workers on the opera have ac
complished, this reviewer's advice to
the reader is: don't think about it—
see it.

some of the best scenes in the opera.
Mrs. Popper, too, must carry off
her share of praise. Although her
role was somewhat smaller than
Miss Hartzell's, she played it with
an intelligent and gay under
standing. Her voice, too, was ex
cellent and blended beautifully
with Miss Hartzell's and the rest
of the cast.
Space does not permit this re
viewer to give as much attention to
the the rest of the cast as they de
serve. Bruce Stewart, although
slightly ill at case, sang beautifully,
and his scenes provided some of the
best comedy in the play.
Pet of (he audience was 15. Q.
Morgan in the role of Slender,
the ridiculous suitor of Mistress
Page's daughter, Anne. lie, with
the other disappointed suitor, Dr.
Cans (Ilarlcn Adams), sent the
audience into laughter every time

(hey came on the stage. The lov
ers, Anne (Losi Sini(h) and Fen
ton (Joseph Tissier), had smaller
parts than the others, hut they
sang very well and played con
vincingly. Miss Smith's soprano
was particularly good.
Edward Wellman (Mr. Ford) was
one of the best in the very-good
cast, with his voicc and acting bet
ter than most. And last but not
least, Jack Taylor (Mr. Page), in
his first opcratic role at Stanford,
more than acquitted himself.
The orchestra, under the direction
of Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, is to
be commended for a fine perform
ance, and scenery, costumes, and
lighting were professional. The cho
rus, too, was first rate, and better
than some we've seen in profession
al musicals. But for a thorough ap
preciation of what the entire cast
and workers on the opera have ac
complished, this reviewer's advice to
the reader is: don't think about it—
see it.
The Stanford Playcsr have done it
again! And this time it was in their
production of Otto Nicolai's comic
opera, "The Merry Wives of Wind
sor," which they presented to a
first-night audience last night. Bou
quets to them and to co-workers in
the Division of Music for a betlcr
than-first-rate student production.
Just exactly whom to begin with
in handing out the plaudits for the
opera is a little difficult to decide.
The plot concerns the efforts of a
fat, old gay blade to flirt with two
wives (not his) at the same time.
The wives (Mistresses Page and
Ford) discover the scheme, and plot
right back again to get even with
the old man.
The result is a gay, rollicking—
if not too logical—performance all
the way through. Ami the singers
treated it as such. Stanford stu
dent Bruce Stewart played the
lead role of Sir John Falstaff, the
old man, and Lois Hartzcll and
Beta Popper were Mistresses Ford
and Page respectively.
The latter two easily gain credit
for the most outstanding perform
ances coupled with the fact that
they had the longest roles. Miss
Hartzell's humorous, lilting soprano
and her wonderful flair for drama
made her perfect for the role of the
scheming Mrs. Ford. Her coy flirta
tions with Falstaff. and her alterca
tion with her jealous husband,
played by Edward Wellman, were
some of the best scenes in the opera.
