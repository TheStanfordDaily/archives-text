ENFORCED UNITY

Open letter to Mr. Stalnaker, in-coming
Dean of Men and Women —
Dear Sir:
We of Stanford who are known as the cus
tomary grumblers, complainers, and "for-gosh
sakers" would like to have a word with you be
fore we're out and it's too late to grumble any
more.
You, Sir, will have a good deal of power here
at Stanford—more than many students are con
scious of—and we hope it may be used to stem
a trend in attitude which has really frightened
some of us of late.
This is an attitude not limited to our own
small campus, but indicative rather, in a small
way, ol a whole world's thinking. In the world
outside you hear it in phrases like "enforced
democracy;" hereabouts it goes under a head
ing that might be called "enforced social re
sponsibility" or "compulsory unity."
Enforced Democracy
Now those who use the term "enforced de
mocracy" believe democracy so important in
itself that they can see no contradiction in its
"enforcement." People must be forced to gov
ern themselves and then they will really like it.
Now those people on campus who are cur
rently working so hard for "compulsory unity"
and "group spirit" and other noble efforts of
that ilk, believe so sincerely that unity of spirit
in itself is all-valuable that they also believe
those few straggling members who do not want
it must have it, also.
And we contend, most firmly, that they must
not. Somewhere along the line there must be
set up a defense and a bulwark for the poor
old maladjusted non-joiner.
On Doing Great Things
Surely we found out some time ago that peace
for its own sake, apart from how and where and
between whom, is no great affair. And now we
are intent on making the same mistake with
unity. You hear it again and again, "Now if
we can just get together we can do great
things." Nobody knows what great things but
they're all ready to get us together anyway.
As a matter of fact great things are not done
by mobs of people. Great things are hung onto
and perpetuated by mobs of people and that's
no small matter. But lots of new things, the un
tried, the very great and the very bad things
are done by the individuals, the "characters,"
the people who don't quite fit.
Surely we used to know this. It was not so
long ago that "she's a character" was a term
of fond approval. Now it goes more often like,
"Well, poor dear, she's a character." Psychol
ogy with its "maladjustment" has thrown an
awful scare into 20th century thinking.
Fo Be Specific
To be specific, let us consider that poor Joe
or Jane who sincerely does not like rallies and
barbecues and house-functions and exchange
dinners —and well, you know who they are.
Are they just lazy, and trying to get out of it?
Should you force them to do their part and have
a good time?
It may be they are lazy and it may be they
are not, but certain it is that no one was ever

forced into "spirit" and comradely feeling. If
they won't join, leave 'em alone.
And then there's always the outside chance
that they don't like group activities because
they only have so much time and prefer spend
ing it in other ways. rfThere is, honestly, lots of
other real work in the world beside perpetuation
of group spirit. Perhaps it's not as important
or worthwhile, but, please, that's up to them to
decide.
And now we've had our grouse, Mr. Stal
naker, and it boils down to about this. Leave
us alone, won't you? There aren't many of us
"rugged individuals" left; the trend is against
us. But if the ground wasn't ploughed over so
hard we might pick up a new recruit or two
here and there. We may do something worth
while later on; we may be miserable flops, and
we may be just plain lazy, but please don't
make us love each other.—Nancy Tilden.
