### PEGGY FITTS 
And so we come to the last week of the quarter's
business—the week we set aside for purposes of polish
ing off whatever remains in the way of good clean fun
before adjourning to our private corners for a bruise
making session of the stuff we came here for. (Study,
y'know.)
All those notebooks and term papers and lab re
ports that have been crouching on the doorstep all
quarter like a lot of milk bottles are suddenly wearing
their deadlines in fat black letters. Everywhere you
look there's a date, the kind you sit at home with.
Spring, left fiat at the Boathouse with nobody to play
with, is packing its bags and heading south; the Quad,
these windy days, looks like something out of "With
ering Heights," they're sweeping the bridge fans out
of the Cellar with the unpaid checks, and in the Re
serve Book Room the accounts are adding up. The
usual number of trains go putting by the Paly station
every hour, and it may be that you wish you were
on one of them, but the magnetic drag of the beatup
Remington and the night-blooming Chesterfield are
stronger than a horse—even an iron horse.
All this sounds a lot worse than it is—we toll our
selves. The week is still before us and there is nothing
in the world to prevent us from doing all those great
things we promised the folks in April. But sometimes
the capacity for great things dribbles out of the indi
vidual like that fresh mountain water out of Lake
Lagunita, and about this time the name of the indi
vidual is mud.
That's all. Miss Mud.
