FREE SPEECH OR NO . . .
Allied armies of liberation apparently have not
brought free speech to Italy: for Piero Nenni. Italian
Socialist leader, was arrested yesterday on charges of
making a speech contrary to the rules of occupation.
He was freed today on the promise he would make no
more political speeches.
Palmiro Togliatti, Communist leader, might also be
arrested for addressing workers in the Milan area.
Heavily armed partisans have stormed newspaper
stands throughout Milan and seized copies of the Cor
riere Delia Sera, which, according to the partisans is
a reactionary Fascist newspaper.
The six dominant Italian political parties had an
nounced agreement on a six point program for a
new government with Nenni as a prominant candi
date to head the government. His arrest interrupted
these plans.
Togliatti attempted to speak Tuesday at Sesta
San Giovanni and was stopped by United States mili
tary police who declared that outdoor meetings were
forbidden. One week ago both Nenni and Togliatti re
quested permission of Major Willis D. Crittenberger,
commanding (he American Fourth Corps, to address
outdoor meetings. He told them that the ban must be
continued.
Alcide de Gasperi. head of the powerful Christian
Democratic party, attacked the leftists severely, as
serting that his party was all-out to block Nenni's
appointment as premier. Alcide de Gasperi was not
suppressed by American military authorities for this
speech.
Apparently our military regime in Europe is de
signed not alone to suppress tyrannic Fascism but lib
eral socialism. We have no light to interfere in Ital
ian politics, when our military security is not threat
ened.
The Italian people will not love lis for these actions;
in particular as there is a profound reaction in this
country against all forms of tyranny. Never will the>
forget their bitterness against Fascism or anything
reminiscent of it. Our action in suppressing free
speech may mi embitter Italian feelings against us that
reconcilement never again will be possible.
