## 
### JULIE CROMMELIN JANE SONTHEIMER 
In her first San Francisco appear- I
â– ince, Patrice Munsel was greeted :
wvith great enthusiasm by a highly |
receptive Opera House audience j
yesterday afternoon.
Standing before the piano in a I
shell-pink, hoop-skirted dress with
i background of United Nations !
flags, Miss Munsel charmed the au- j
dience by her complete poise, her
graciousness, and her generosity to j
Mer listeners.

Included in her program were:
i "Allelujah" from "Exultate," by
1 Handel; the aria "Ah! Lo So" from
I"The Magic Flute" by Mozart; Bish
! op's "Lo! Hear the Gentle Lark"
I with flute obligato accompaniment.
Sintfs French Songs
I A series of French songs: "Le
' Printemps," by Fevrier; "Petite Pou-
I pee," by Poldini-LaForge; Jacobson's
I "Chanson de Marie Antoinette"; and
I "Carnaval," by Foudrain.
j Her most popular number was
j the "Mad Scene" from "Lucia di
| Lammermoor," by Donizetti, with

which she won her Metropolitan I
Opera audition. She sang with J
J great maturity and security of voice i
in this highly intricate number, in
which she was accompanied by a j
flute obligato by Evelyn Crocker.
Voice Carries Well
Although suffering from laryngi
tis, Miss Munsel gave no indication
of this in her concert. Her voice was
full and carried to the farthest parts
of the house, even when singing her
lowest and softest notes. Not only
her singing, but her manner of
| presentation in characterizing every
number contributed greatly to her
audience appeal. She was serious
one moment and gay the next, ac
cording to her interpretation of each
song.
Stuart Ross accompanied Miss
Munsel on the piano with versa
tility, blending his playing with a
( complete understanding of Miss j
Munsel's voice to give her excellent j
support. Miss Crocker's flute ac- j
i companiment in several numbers
| also served well to augment the j
1 quality of Miss Munsel's singing.
