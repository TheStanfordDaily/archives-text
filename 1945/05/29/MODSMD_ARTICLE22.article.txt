# Traditional Spring Sing Here Again!
## 22 Campus Groups Prime for Content At Amphitheater 
### 
It's with us again, Stanford's an
nual Spring Sing, the all-campus
musical show with choral selections
arranged and presented by more
than 20 campus groups. Martha
Austin, Cardinals member in charge
of the Sing, announced that a panel
of four faculty judges will pick out
the winners from three classifica
tions —the best women's, best men's,
and best graduate groups.
Judges Preparing, Too
Dr. Henry Lanz, Dr. Jan Popper,
Dr. Warren Allen, and Mr. Harlen
Adams have been selected as judges.
Students of Dr. D. Sterling Wheel
wright's classes are revising the sys
+em of judging, allotting points to
-nght phases of presentation, ac
cording to Miss Austin. It is hoped
that this list may be published in
Friday's Daily so that participants
may keep in mind those points on
which they are to be judged.
Ric Supple, ex-cheer leader, will
officiate as master of ceremonies at
the Sing. The platform of the am
phitheater will have as backdrop the
large Stanford banner which stu
dents carried with them to the Cal-
U.S.C. game last autumn.
(ioing Somewhere?
The Sing will begin promptly at
7:15, according to Miss Austin, and
if all goes according to schedule
should be finished by 9 p.m., so that
men and women desiring to attend
firesides already planned may be
present at both affairs.
The three trophies, which are
passed on from year to year, will be
placed on the table before which
the judges sit, and will be presented
a few moments after the Sing's com
pletion. Last year's winners, Casa
Granada, the S.A.E.'s, and Med
School, will offer the trophies, but
Med School, at least, expects to win
its cup back since it is the only
graduate entrant.
Listen and You Shall Hear
Lagunita will sing "Remember";
the nurses from Stanford Lane, a
medley of war songs; Jordan, "The
Lord's Prayer"; Hurlburt, "Waltzing
Matilda"; Madrono, "I'll Never Be
Alone"; Union, "I Want a Real Col
lege Man"; Med School, "Aura Lee"
and"The Whiffenpoof Song"; Ro->
ble, "Holiday for Strings"; Branner,
"Orchids in the Moonlight"; and

a few moments after the Sing's com
pletion. Last year's winners, Casa
Granada, the S.A.E.'s, and Med
School, will offer the trophies, but
Med School, at least, expects to win
its cup back since it is the only
graduate entrant.
Listen and You Shall Hear
Lagunita will sing "Remember";
the nurses from Stanford Lane, a
medley of war songs; Jordan, "The
Lord's Prayer"; Hurlburt, "Waltzing
Matilda"; Madrono, "I'll Never Be
Alone"; Union, "I Want a Real Col
lege Man"; Med School, "Aura Lee"
and"The Whiffenpoof Song"; Ro->
ble, "Holiday for Strings"; Branner,
"Orchids in the Moonlight"; and
Storey, "I Told Every Little Star,"
to list only a few of the 22 entrants
that will be participating Friday.
It's with us again, Stanford's an
nual Spring Sing, the all-campus
musical show with choral selections
arranged and presented by more
than 20 campus groups. Martha
Austin, Cardinals member in charge
of the Sing, announced that a panel
of four faculty judges will pick out
the winners from three classifica
tions —the best women's, best men's,
and best graduate groups.
Judges Preparing, Too
Dr. Henry Lanz, Dr. Jan Popper,
Dr. Warren Allen, and Mr. Harlen
Adams have been selected as judges.
Students of Dr. D. Sterling Wheel
wright's classes are revising the sys
+em of judging, allotting points to
-nght phases of presentation, ac
cording to Miss Austin. It is hoped
that this list may be published in
Friday's Daily so that participants
may keep in mind those points on
which they are to be judged.
Ric Supple, ex-cheer leader, will
officiate as master of ceremonies at
the Sing. The platform of the am
phitheater will have as backdrop the
large Stanford banner which stu
dents carried with them to the Cal-
U.S.C. game last autumn.
(ioing Somewhere?
The Sing will begin promptly at
7:15, according to Miss Austin, and
if all goes according to schedule
should be finished by 9 p.m., so that
men and women desiring to attend
firesides already planned may be
present at both affairs.
The three trophies, which are
passed on from year to year, will be
placed on the table before which
the judges sit, and will be presented
a few moments after the Sing's com
pletion. Last year's winners, Casa
Granada, the S.A.E.'s, and Med
School, will offer the trophies, but
