WASHINGTON, May 28 (UP).-
President Truman today asked Con
gress to expand unemployment in
surance for war workers idle during
the shift to peacetime production.
He urged weekly payments of $25
for an unemployed worker. In a
special message to Congress he said
the government has "a moral obli
gation to war workers who stuck
faithfully to their jobs." The pro
posed bill he said was also to pro
vide increases in the amount and
duration of benefits for all eligible
workers by supplementing state
payment with federal funds.
