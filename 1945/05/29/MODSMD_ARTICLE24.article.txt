SAN FRANCISCO, May 28 (UP).
â€”Secretary of State Stettinius de
fended the Bir; Five power of veto
in the World Security Conference as
"not a question of privilege but of
using the present distribution of
military and industrial powers, in.
the world maintenance of pea<e,"
As a controversy between the major
powers and the small nations over
voting procedure neared a climax,
Stettinius told the world in a radio
broadcast that the veto vested in
the United States, Great Britain,
France, Russia and China does not
constitute a privileged position of
a large nation. That criticism he
said is not justified.
