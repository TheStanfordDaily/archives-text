NEW CONSTITUTION
OLD STUMBLING BLOCKS
The proposed Constitution before the Asso
ciated Students Executive Committee promises
to thrust that hollow and time-ridden ghost of
"this is not the time to do things" before the
siudent body.
It will be too bad if the new document is
not adopted and put to a student vote for op
eration in the Fall quarter. It should be good
endorsement to know that the document is not
an experiment in student government by kiddies
tired of the inactivity of the war period; rather
is is an attempt to correct the serious lapses,
duplications, and contradictions found evident
in the present suspended constitution.
I: is not asking the impossible to ask the new
officers to work under this constitution, it is
providing them with a clearer guide to student
organizations, accomplished when the faults of
the old constitution have been made too ob
vious to escape notice.
Already the most radical changes in Excom
representation and election method have been
put into effect as present by-laws and the best
election turnout in yea's is evidence of their
endorsement.
Other changes in the constitution are far less
radical and are an over-all attempt to bring the
various boards and councils into a clear pattern
of student government.
Examined for all practical purposes, this is
the ideal time to adopt the Constitution. By
next winter lor sure, Stanford will be fielding
athletic teams, enrollment can expect a sizeable
boost from the Navy and returning veterans.
Transportation, resorts, and consumer goods
will be making a rapid return to normalcy and
we are faulty in our thinking if we expect a
lul! before the transition into normalcy that
will provide blueprinting of the structure of
student affairs at Stanford.
The next year will call for rapid adjustments
and decisions along lines now provided for.
It is fortunate that the new ASSU will be headed
by a Veteran who can gain the confidence of
returning men for experience he shall have in
understanding the problems of Stanford in both
peace and wartime.
Already the ASSU, the University program,
the Daily, and other organizations and depart
ments are laying out lines of easy resumption
of Stanford life in a time of peace.
Not only is it backward sentimentalism for the
past to be afraid of changes, but it is an un
necessary assumption of wisdom to think that
the absence of Stanford men, who would like to
be in on the changes, is not self-evident and
manifest in all things that we do. It is not, how
ever, an excuse for failing to meet our respon
sibilities now.
One of these is to provide for the adoption of
the new constitution while its problems and
recommendations are being studied. The logical
time is now, with provisions for student vote in
the fall.
GRINDING THAT AXE
It's open season on the administration again,
with the final word being sought from Pacific
Coast Conference schools on Stanford's re
suming football in the fall. The opinion of
Stanford students is well-known and we've
never sought to more than ram it down any
one's hroat ourselves.
The facts on both sides have piled up and
reviewing them has grown to be a nauseating
task. We'll skip it, and only add some thoughts
that we think have some value.
We were in high school when the Stanford
policy to discontinue sports was announced.
We saw the last team in the Stadium, our
freshman year, and though we were excep
tionally rabid about the team and what we
thought it symbolized about the spirit and high
class performance of the school, we thought
the policy to discontinue athletics during the
war was a smart and courageous step.
Since then we have learned that though the
policy sounds good in press releases it has
proven very costly to the students' spirit. Right

ly or wrongly a lot of school feeling has been
attached to the athletic teams, and it seems clear
that no substitute has been found during the
war period.
As far as entering competition goes in al
lowing games where it is possible, the neces
sary curtailment of material and transportation
will automatically keep us from an overex
tended and haphazard competition that would
discredit the school.
It is to be considered also from our point of
view that the lack of football has handicapped
other activities in an unexpected way. It has
brought a blow to morale that has caused every
other attempt at stepping up activity to be
greeted by an "Oh, what's the use" and a
sigh for the "good old dciys."
The other important reason not already in
the foreground is the very rough treatment that
the few Stanford athletes, here, have taken
from other organizations who have "let" them
perform for them.
Some have been insulted because of race,
others shamefully neglected and kept in ig
norance of plans. The whole situation has been
very bitter for them and apparent to the rest
of the student body.
It hasn't been fun in the face of all this, but
not very many have expected fun during the
war. It has made the necessary privations twice
as hard to take, however, to know that unneces
sary demands have been made upon the flag
ging hopes of the student body.
Stanford students are able to feel that the
mind of the administration is never closed to
student argument, and we hope that it is not
too late to give something in the way of en
couragement to the last days of those who have
"seen Stanford through." Student opinion has
been firm for some time.
