# Seen from an Ivory Tower

Summer is the yachting season on San Francisco
Bay. Only a few miles from the Stanford campus, a
pleasant cycle-ride of a summer morning, is the Yacht
Harbor of Palo Alto. The number of students who take
advantage of this geographical amenity is ludicrously
small.
Like most men when they enjoy a good thing, I
would like to share it with all. At the Yacht Harbor
my 16-foot sloop "Sea Biscuit" is moored. The pleasure
I have had frm that little boat is out of all proportion
to its cost, whether reckoned in money, anxiety, or
work.
At the Yacht Harbor there is a base for the Stanford
Area Sea Scouts, a Yacht Club for men a little older
than Sea Scouts and floats for the large variety of sail
ing and power craft owned by people living in this
neighborhood.
Even before the agk at which a youngster is eligible
to join the Sea Scouts, the nautical passion is apparent.
The young boy stands around the docks gazing wide
eyed and hopefully at the yachtsmen busy with their
gear. If he is invited aboard he is in a rapture of
excitement. Though a boy so young is almost always
a nuisance on board a boat, yet the ease with which
this young fellow's heart can be made joyful, tempts
many a yachtsman to ship him as "cabin-boy;" the
title is honorary, the duties are nominal and consist
chiefly of his being required to make himself as small
as possible and keep out of the way.
Sea Scouting is enjoyed by the older boys. They
learn the rudiments of sailing by the pleasantest meth
od: in company of their friends, on board a 30-foot
ketch and under the constant exigencies of sailing
the tortous channel from Palo Alto Harbor to the open
Bay. Their life is no rougher than boys of that age
seem to prefer for themselves. Now and again an older
person is astonished or dismayed to see a young Sea
Scout thrown into the water by his companions, but he
bobs up again with a smile on his face. In this way
in boyhood, friendships are cemented; only adults
would get peeved at being the victim of their friends'
light-heartedness.
This general lightness of heart seems now and then
to be communicated to their heads. The Sea Scout
ketch is sometimes seen weaving an erratic course
about the Harbor while the crew is busy about its
private affairs. Wiser and older yachtsmen keep out
of its way.
It is too seldom that American boys get correction
when they need it, but this is told of an irascible
yachtsman of Redwood City who had been much tor
mented by the antics of the Sea Scout boat all after
noon and who finally had his worst fears confirmed
when his yacht was rammed, due to the inattention of
the boys on the boat.
When the Sea Scout boat finally came in, he climbed
on board without saying a word, turned the helmsman
face-downward over his knee and spanked him sound
ly. The boy was too surprised to struggle. However,
a suitable punishment of this sort is rarely meted out
to careless sailors, perhaps unfortunately, so prospec
tive yachtsmen from Stanford need not be apprehen
sive.
For the nrivate yacht-owner there is the Palo Alto
Yacht Club. Mere, around the blazing fire in the Club
room, the members smoke their pipes and recall their
yachting experiences. 11 well becomes a younger man
merely to look and listen. There he will hear stories of
sailing adventures outside the Gate, of wrecks and
near-wrecks, of 36-hour races around the Bay and
the glories of the days when paddle-wheelers steamed
up and down the Sacramento.
Photographs are sometimes passed around, a record
of sunny days at Balboa, or of peaceful nights under
the stars as the boat rifles the long, regular swells
of the Pacific on its way to Hawaii. Sydney Ross.

yachtsman of Redwood City who had been much tor
mented by the antics of the Sea Scout boat all after
noon and who finally had his worst fears confirmed
when his yacht was rammed, due to the inattention of
the boys on the boat.
When the Sea Scout boat finally came in, he climbed
on board without saying a word, turned the helmsman
face-downward over his knee and spanked him sound
ly. The boy was too surprised to struggle. However,
a suitable punishment of this sort is rarely meted out
to careless sailors, perhaps unfortunately, so prospec

For the nrivate yacht-owner there is the Palo Alto
Yacht Club. Mere, around the blazing fire in the Club
room, the members smoke their pipes and recall their
yachting experiences. 11 well becomes a younger man
merely to look and listen. There he will hear stories of
sailing adventures outside the Gate, of wrecks and
near-wrecks, of 36-hour races around the Bay and
the glories of the days when paddle-wheelers steamed
up and down the Sacramento.
Photographs are sometimes passed around, a record
of sunny days at Balboa, or of peaceful nights under
the stars as the boat rifles the long, regular swells

Summer is the yachting season on San Francisco
Bay. Only a few miles from the Stanford campus, a
pleasant cycle-ride of a summer morning, is the Yacht
Harbor of Palo Alto. The number of students who take
advantage of this geographical amenity is ludicrously
small.
Like most men when they enjoy a good thing, I
would like to share it with all. At the Yacht Harbor
my 16-foot sloop "Sea Biscuit" is moored. The pleasure
I have had frm that little boat is out of all proportion
to its cost, whether reckoned in money, anxiety, or
work.
At the Yacht Harbor there is a base for the Stanford
Area Sea Scouts, a Yacht Club for men a little older
than Sea Scouts and floats for the large variety of sail
ing and power craft owned by people living in this
neighborhood.
Even before the agk at which a youngster is eligible
to join the Sea Scouts, the nautical passion is apparent.
The young boy stands around the docks gazing wide
eyed and hopefully at the yachtsmen busy with their
gear. If he is invited aboard he is in a rapture of
excitement. Though a boy so young is almost always
a nuisance on board a boat, yet the ease with which
this young fellow's heart can be made joyful, tempts
many a yachtsman to ship him as "cabin-boy;" the
title is honorary, the duties are nominal and consist
chiefly of his being required to make himself as small
as possible and keep out of the way.
Sea Scouting is enjoyed by the older boys. They
learn the rudiments of sailing by the pleasantest meth
od: in company of their friends, on board a 30-foot
ketch and under the constant exigencies of sailing
the tortous channel from Palo Alto Harbor to the open
Bay. Their life is no rougher than boys of that age
seem to prefer for themselves. Now and again an older
person is astonished or dismayed to see a young Sea
Scout thrown into the water by his companions, but he
bobs up again with a smile on his face. In this way
in boyhood, friendships are cemented; only adults
would get peeved at being the victim of their friends'
light-heartedness.
This general lightness of heart seems now and then
to be communicated to their heads. The Sea Scout
ketch is sometimes seen weaving an erratic course
about the Harbor while the crew is busy about its
private affairs. Wiser and older yachtsmen keep out
of its way.
It is too seldom that American boys get correction
when they need it, but this is told of an irascible
yachtsman of Redwood City who had been much tor
mented by the antics of the Sea Scout boat all after
