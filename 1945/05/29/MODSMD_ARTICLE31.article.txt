ENCINA CHOW
I have eaten Encina chow for
three years, sometimes it was bad,
sometimes worse and sometimes
rotten; but it has never been as
good as in the last three months, in
spite of less quality and quantity
during that time, due to stricter ra
tioning.
As well as being qualified to speak
as a civilian of three years' service
at Encina, I am also able to speak
as a soldier. During my twelve
years' service in the U.S. Army I
have eaten greasy bacon mixed with
the sand of Bataan, and yellow mud
in our "Mulligan" on the battlefields
of France; but never did I receive
ice cream or lemon cream pie as
you gentlemen (in and out of uni
form) get twice a week.
And as you mention food for your
pet dog, I have to tell you that I
once had a French poodle who liked
Limburger cheese, and sauerkraut
but would not touch lemon cream
pie: must have been a Nazi in dis
guise.
I could contradict all your state
ments beginning with soup and
salad down to nuts but you can do
that for yourself by comparing with
the weekly menu. And it is not
going to get any better, as anybody
knows who reads the daily papers
and not only the comic section, be
cause the war isn't over by a long
shot.
You carefully refrained from crit
icizing quality and quantity due to
rationing but you perhaps don't
know that Encina chow is prepared
according to a Master Menu issued
by the War Department and only
modified legally wherever possible
to improve taste. And you perhaps
didn't know it is prepared by a re
tired Army cook with 30 years'
service and II honorable discharges.
Is he mad? Hell, no; after thirty
years of Army griping he is still
sane. He felt lost on this peaceful
Farm but now I see a perpetual
smile on his face, and he mumbles
a refrain "Army days are here
again!"
I venture to state that your Mom
cannot prepare a more nourishing,
healthy food thnn Encina chow; not
day in and day out with the few red
and blue points that Uncle Sam al
lows, unless she patronizes a black
market.
Boyhood memories linger on and

j I like lo think of the day when my
Mom prepared the awful spinach so
| disguised wtih fancy frills and gar
-1 nishings on a dainty plate that we
ate it before we knew what it was.
But since I am grown up I like my
j steaks medium rare, my liquor hard,
i and my women wild—don't you,
! boys?
I think Ma Holt at Branner is
| spoiling you at those Exchange Din
ners, wilh fancy frills and dainty
dishes, sitting next to a fair lady. I
am going to write my Congressman
j because there ought to be a law
against Exchange dinners for the
duration.
During my soldiering days, com
plaints justified or not became
known through military channels
only, or v/ere subject to conse
quences as a courtmartial might di
rect. But times and soldiering have
changed. Today, complaints are
| translated in the soldier's flowery
language as "gripes." Gripes are the
manifestation of good morale, says
one high-ranking military officer.
According to this, the morale of our
bovs on the Stanford campus is ex
cellent.
Talk about gripes! One of the
buddies came to me on a blue Mon
day morning with a bottle of milk,
one of the thousands delivered that
mo-rning, and states: "This tastes like
milk of magnesia!" Listen to the
voice of experience: Bayshore does
funny things to one's taste on the
morning after the night before. I
gave him another bottle and I drank
the milk of magnesia.
Am I bitter? Hell, no. I like you,
your gripes, your academic free
i dom of expression in conformity
i with the great motto on the Stan
j ford seal—Die Luft der Freiheit
weht—as long as you grant that
t right and freedom to everyone, big
