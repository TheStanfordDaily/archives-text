# World Peace Notes—1945

### TED DRENTON 
Germany very likely will swing
politically and violently to the left.
The Germans have been taught for
eleven years that the Russians with
their Communism were deadly en
emies of the so-called German cul
ture and that they would commit
horrible atrocities if they should
ever overrun Germany.
The Russians have overrun a large
segment of Germany and have com
mitted no such atrocities as were
promised by the Nazis, and in fact
have treated the people with re
markable kindness. In the Russian
occupied areas the whole policy has
been, back to normal. Generous
food rations have been allotted in
Berlin and other cities, and the Ger
mans are eating better food than
they enjoyed under the Nazi regime.
Business Rebuilt
Business men in Berlin have been
ureed to reopen their shops and es
tablish normal trade. Musical con
certs are being given and in general
cultural activities are coming into
their own.
At the same time the Russians are
very swiftly punishing the Nazi
| criminals, who are now despised by
! a sizeable part of the German pop
t ulation, hence this action is favor
able to most German people. Eng
j lish and American armies of occupa
j tion are being kept strictly out of
j the Russian occupation zone, un
j doubtedly for very good reasons.
Leftists Take Over
Leftist officials are being put into
| key governmental positions in all
this territory, while the people are
being re-educated in their concepts
of Russia and Communism. On the
contrary in the Anglo-American oc
cupation zone the German people
are being treated very sternly with
| talk of forced starvation and cur
i tailment of personal liberty.
The Nazi criminals who have
| really committed the atrocities
I against civilization are not being
| swiftly punished and in fact are not
| being punished at all. Our pseudo-
I aristocratic army officers are frater
! nizing with German officers and
j other war criminals, congratulating
: them on their abilities as fellow mil
| itarists rather than as murderers.
Not Purging Officials
Politically we are not purging
j Nazi officials from the government
although we are swiftly and ruth
lessly dissipating anti-Nazi organi
j zations in the Rhineland. German
i officers still strut through German
! towns and German soldiers sing
i their songs of hate as they ride in
j our troop convoys. German Nazis
; still gather in the streets lustily
cheering these soldiers.
It is not difficult to surmise as to
j which of the Allies has most im
pressed the German people. The
matter is simple. The Russians have
a plan of occupation, namely to win
over the German people to Commu
nism, while we haven't any plan
I other than our own prejudices
against Communistic forces and sev
-1 eral amateurish ideas on suppress-
I ing fanatical Nazi militarism.
Antagonizing the People
j The result is that we are antago
nizing the German little man, who
in most cases is thoroughly fed up
with Nazism, while we are encour
aging the smaller yet powerful
group of Nazis and militarists to
continue with their evil activities,
j In influence we are losing where we
should be winning and winning
where we should be losing.
The result is that the German
people can racidly forget their fears
of Russia and losing respect for us
will begin to gravitate toward that
country's political camp. In other
words Russia will gain control over
Germany, and will win the peace
rather than the Allies in concert.
Anglo-American influence in Eu
rope may then vanish in the face of
the powerful combination of Ger
many and Russia.

to all of you, your future, for more
and better gripes.
