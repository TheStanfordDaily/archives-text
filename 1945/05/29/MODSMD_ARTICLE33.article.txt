We have stuck with the Chappie
through thick and thin. We must
admit that some of it has been pret
ty thin, but the hope that some day
some semblance of a red hot campus
mag might emerge from these hum
ble beginnings has kept us standing
by.
But this is too much! Last week
we read in your publication that the
Chappie (desperate probably for
lack of good gags) is turning to
COLOR as an added attraction (?).
Now we heard a little too much that
Lucky Strike green had gone to
war, and we're just a little pushed
that the Chappie is taking it upon
their collective selves to muster the
accessary discharge points to bring
it back.
What we really mean is, why col
or? Wc sorta liked the Chappie the
way jt was—all in black and white.
We were used to it and it won't
seem like the same old Farm with
out the same old Chappie. And
think what Stanford men, sweating
it out overseas, are going to think
when they see it. They won't recog
nize it..
And we object to this Esquire idea
100. Now the Farm is the Farm and
Esquire is sophisticated. How can
we maintain the "rough" tradition if
Ihe Chappie is going to go high hat
on us? Frankly, wc object.
