# 'Without Love' Crackles-- Oh, Rahlly Hepburn Does
## 
### 
"Without Love" is absolutely the most delightful comedy that ever
pulled anyone out of a pre-Dead Week slump. It has Katharine Hepburn
at her most Hepburnish, Spencer Tracy in top form, and a script that
crackles all the way through.
The plot's simple enough. Tracy's a scientist in Washington, looking for

a laboratory. He moves in with
manlessly indifferent Hepburn. They
become married just to ease the
housing shortage and because they
are both interested in oxygen and
the altitude.
Unbolt That Door
After quite a period of going to
their separate rooms each night and
bolting their doors alter them, they

realize that they
are in love. You
see how simple
it is? They are
already married
and everything.
The whole sit
uation is rather
improbable, but
if you'll just for
get for the eve
ning that you're

a rational - thinking graduate of
Western Civ, the world will seem
a big rosy place full of high cheek
bones and romantic scientists.
Rahlly Extreme
You laugh yourself onto the ashy
balcony floor at Hepburn. After not
having seen her for nearly a year,
you rahlly quite forget how ex
treme her accent is and how near
her cheekbones are to her eyes, and
how funny they'd look if they were
up on her forehead. You have to
remind yourself every few minutes
that this is the real Hepburn, and
not just another imitation.
Probably the next best point is
Hepburn's drunk cousin, who steals
the complete first fourth of the
movie. He's just sober enough to
put the act over without slapstick,
and just near-sighted enough to
make everything pleasantly blurry.
Soldier This Time
In true Paly style, "Identity Un
known," the second feature, com
pletely counteracts everything that
was good in "Without Love." Rich
ard Arlen was apparently crowded
out of his field by Gene Autry, and
makes his appearance in this movie
as a soldier.
No doubt he was terribly sad
about leaving cowboy roles, because
it looks like he stuffed a whole herd
of cattle under his uniform. Or
could it be that Richard Arlen is
getting paunchy?
Stinky Enough
The picture was stinky enough all
the way through, but ended on a
particularly foul note. Arlen, who
lost his memory in overseas combat,
finally remembers who he is, throws
out his chest, and marches down a
long corridor.
Martial music is playing in the
background, while an officer looks
after Arlen and puts in an inspira
tional plug for War Bonds. All it
lacks is a "Keep Our City Streets
Clean" sign.â€”Owen
