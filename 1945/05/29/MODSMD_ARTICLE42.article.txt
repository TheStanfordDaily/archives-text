The Levant crisis boils, foams, and
I threatens to erupt. It is as dra
matic as forming thunderheads dur
ing a flood season, but it is not too
significant, except as it effects it
i sell. It is interesting discussion,
and the main reason is that, with
Germany fallen, and the Pacific
more or less stagnant, there is not
too much else to talk about.
Syria and Lebanon got their in
dependence from France under the
provisions of the old Mandate sys
tem, but France demanded a "most
favored nation" position. The Syr
ians and Lebanese refused to grant
it, and the French sent in Senegalese
troopers as ambassadors of bad will.

i The Crisis Develops
The national spirit is very intense
and very unexplainable, especially
when it is newly awakened. The
peoples of the two states were en
raged, indignant, and with a strong
feeling of being insulted. They made
demonstrations, at first passive.
But the Senegalese have few in
hibitions about using their arms.
They dispersed the crowds with rifle
lire. There was only one thing left
| to do, and that was fight.
The Arab States Meet
Syria and Lebanon both had Al
lies. The sum total was ineffective
in terms of firepower, but it was
still honor bound to act en masse.

! Thus the League of Arab states is
meeting, is promising to aid the two
little nations, while those two states
are barricading their buildings and
putting machine guns on the roofs,
| and the French are moving more
troops into the area.
War might develop at any time. If
nature is left to take her course, it
probably will come, since the only
thing to stop France from routing
the whole Arab League combination
would be outside intervention.
Foreign Reaction
So far, Russia is silent, probably
i thinking that the friendship of
France is more important than the
fate of two minor pieces of real es
tate in the Near Eastern deserts.
England is asking to mediate, most
ly because it is election time. Ameri
can opinion is very confused, has
yet to have official crystallization, I

is vaguely against the French, but
only definite in the idea that it
would have been better of the whole
thing had never come up.
As for the war itself, if English
mediation doesn't stop it from com
ing, it might divide into three stages.
The Future Battles
First would be the defensive
jtage. caused by the fact that the
Arab League would feel politically
bound to move to their allies' res
cue. The French troops would try
to hold with infantry armed with
heavy machine guns and wear the
enemy down until heavy mechan
ized units shatter the Arab forces.
The third would be the motorized
stage, in which armored cars and
motor-born machine gun units
would race ahead of the tanks and
try to cut oft the Arab fragments
before they could get away into the
hills.
Conclusions
As an issue in world poli
tics, this is simply a maneuver in
which both sides use live ammu
nition. It Is unimportant, because
soon the peace conference in Eu
rope will take attention away
from the Near Eastern sideshow.
As a military issue, it is poten
tially important in that it can show
exactly how effective modern
weapons are in colonial warfare,
and thus demonstrate whether
the modern colonial powers have

yet grabbed more than they can
hold onto.
A war followed by a French vic
tory would thus bring about quiet
in the colonial dependencies of all
nations. But it would be a brood
ing, plotting quiet, of long, but not
j indefinite boundaries in time. It
| would simply postpone for a few
J generations, the lest of sovereign na
tions versus empire.
