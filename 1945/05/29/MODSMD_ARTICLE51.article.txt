### MORT COHEN 
When tomorrow rolls around and
the sun sets over the sunken dia
mond, the intramural season, and fox
that matter all organized sports, will
be ended for the spring quarter,
1945. We were just wondering how
swell it would be if there were a
turnout for the game tomorrow be
tween the Civilian and Army All-
Stars; it sure would bring back old
times. About the only thing the
"ame would be missing 'would be
the Stanford uniforms (why they
don't let the All-Stars wear them is
beyond us) and the publicity in the
San Francisco papers (we can make
up for that).'
It Will Be Good
Without a doubt the game will be
exciting, as exciting as any base
ball game can be. The line-ups are
strong; the spirit is high, but it
would be much higher if the stu
dents were behind the game. Can't
you just picture the bleachers full
again, with the rooting sections
cheering their favored teams on, and
the bands playing? Then, no one
could yell about the lack of spirit
at Stanford, and the girls would not
have to get together and sing and
cheer for the sake of singing and
cheering; they would have some
thing to sing and cheer about.
And the men could bring back
their spirit of competitive athletics
and have some real rivalry be
tween their men and those of the
Army. Who knows, maybe it will
be the start of something good. We
still remember summer quarter
when different men's halls played
against. Army units and kept up the
fight; some of those games were the
most thrilling ever seen in the Pa
vilion. The only thing they lacked
was student support.
We Have Hopes
This sounds like a lot of rambling
on, but we hope it isn't. We can't
think of any reason why the stu

dents, all of them, don't come out
and watch the games. This is their
last chance this quarter; for many it
will be their last chance for any
quarter. There is only one way to
take advantage of this good fortune,
and that is by going out to the
game tomorrow night.
Some would say that we were
sticking our necks out, but we
don't think so. We promise that the
game will be terrific; it will be one
of the best Softball games Stanford
has ever seen. The civilians have
two above average pitchers in Joe
Sher and Luke Pitts. They have
outstanding fielders and hitters in
Ed Luce, Tom Ashley, Doc Mason,
Bob Rosburg, Bob Slobe, Frank
HofTman and all the others that
make up the team. The Army has
men of the same caliber, maybe a
little less experienced. They also
have the fight to go out and win and
dump Stanford's civilian teams.
We Still Have Hopes
Don't forget. The game is to be
played tomorrow, 7:15, in the Sunk
en Diamond. Let's see a real turn
out and some of that old spirit back
again on campus. When we do re
turn to intercollegiate sports, we
want to start of! correctly.

cheering their favored teams on, and
the bands playing? Then, no one
could yell about the lack of spirit
at Stanford, and the girls would not
have to get together and sing and
cheer for the sake of singing and
cheering; they would have some
thing to sing and cheer about.
And the men could bring back
their spirit of competitive athletics
and have some real rivalry be
tween their men and those of the
Army. Who knows, maybe it will
be the start of something good. We
still remember summer quarter
when different men's halls played
against. Army units and kept up the
fight; some of those games were the
most thrilling ever seen in the Pa
vilion. The only thing they lacked
was student support.
We Have Hopes
This sounds like a lot of rambling
on, but we hope it isn't. We can't
think of any reason why the stu

dents, all of them, don't come out
and watch the games. This is their
last chance this quarter; for many it
will be their last chance for any
quarter. There is only one way to
take advantage of this good fortune,
and that is by going out to the
game tomorrow night.
Some would say that we were
sticking our necks out, but we
don't think so. We promise that the
game will be terrific; it will be one
of the best Softball games Stanford
has ever seen. The civilians have
two above average pitchers in Joe
Sher and Luke Pitts. They have
outstanding fielders and hitters in
Ed Luce, Tom Ashley, Doc Mason,
Bob Rosburg, Bob Slobe, Frank
HofTman and all the others that
make up the team. The Army has
men of the same caliber, maybe a
little less experienced. They also
have the fight to go out and win and
dump Stanford's civilian teams.
We Still Have Hopes
Don't forget. The game is to be
played tomorrow, 7:15, in the Sunk
en Diamond. Let's see a real turn
out and some of that old spirit back
again on campus. When we do re
turn to intercollegiate sports, we
want to start of! correctly.
When tomorrow rolls around and
the sun sets over the sunken dia
mond, the intramural season, and fox
that matter all organized sports, will
be ended for the spring quarter,
1945. We were just wondering how
swell it would be if there were a
turnout for the game tomorrow be
tween the Civilian and Army All-
Stars; it sure would bring back old
times. About the only thing the
"ame would be missing 'would be
the Stanford uniforms (why they
don't let the All-Stars wear them is
beyond us) and the publicity in the
San Francisco papers (we can make
up for that).'
It Will Be Good
Without a doubt the game will be
exciting, as exciting as any base
ball game can be. The line-ups are
strong; the spirit is high, but it
would be much higher if the stu
dents were behind the game. Can't
you just picture the bleachers full
again, with the rooting sections
cheering their favored teams on, and
the bands playing? Then, no one
could yell about the lack of spirit
at Stanford, and the girls would not
have to get together and sing and
cheer for the sake of singing and
