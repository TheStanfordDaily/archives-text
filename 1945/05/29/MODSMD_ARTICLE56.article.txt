# Hiler, Luce Take Firsts
## 
### 
Dominating the field for the third
consecutive time this year, five
Stanford men again made history as
they annexed three first places (one
of them was a tie), one second place,
one third place, and one fourth place
in the Pacific Association Track
Meet held last Saturday at Berke
ley. Outstanding were A 1 Hershey,
Emerson Hiler, and Gordon Dunn.
Although Ed Luce tied for first place
with a jump of six feet, he was defi
nitely of! form. This has been his
worst showing this year.
Ililcr Takes Discus
As usual, Hiler came through
with a good toss, this one hitting
over 154 feet, to win the discus
event. Hiler has been the most
consistent tosser on the Coast this
year and has not lost oncc. The
"surprise" of the Fresno Relays and
the "come-throuch" man of Satur
day's meet was A 1 Hershey who put
the shot over 50 feet to stay on the
top. His closest competitor could hit
only 48 feet.
Gordon Dunn, oncc the world's
greatest weight man, is still out of
shape, but did well enough to take
a third in the 16-pound hammer
throw and a fourth in the discus.
Dick Northcraft again did well in
javelin and took a second place with
a throw of 180 ft. 4 , /Â» ft. This Ls the
second meet in which he has placcd
high.
Continued Improvement
The meet showed one thing, more
than anything else, and that was the
improvement of the athletes. Ex
cept for Luce, they were better than
ever. Especially was this true of
Hiler, who got off his best toss of
the year and beat Cal's Roger Hard
ing by ten feet.
