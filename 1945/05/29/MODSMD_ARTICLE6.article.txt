### LISA EBBERTS 
(Editorial note: This is the
eighth in our series of articles on
Stanford's present and postwar
outlook.)
"This is (lie most democratic
school I know," said Miss Mary
Yost, Stanford's Dean of Women.
A"Wc don't merely preach equality,
try to practice it wholehearted
ly." A Daily reporter had just asked
Miss Yost what she liked best at
Stanford.
Working Students
As outstanding proof she men
tioned the Stanford attitude toward
working students. It includes no
snobbery. Hashers and library as
sistants are not at any social dis
advantage. Rather they are admired
by other students for the extra-cur
ricular work they are doing. Miss
Yost told jokingly of one hasher
who was heard to say, "I work there
for the social contacts."
"How is Stanford weakest?" we
asked, and this was Miss Yost's re
ply: "Our school offers unusual op
portunities to students, individual
and collective, for wide freedoms.
Sometimes they forget that with
freedom should go responsibility;
and the welfare of the group and
of the University thereby suffers."
Strength Over Weakness
Here Miss Yost paused and
smiled. I think of the
strength of our student group I find
that their weaknesses, however sig
nificant, take a second place.
'Through our student govern
ment activities and our customs and
codes we have developed a fine
group of young leaders who put
service to the University and to
their fellow students before personal
wishes. Our great problem is to in
crease this number to include po
tentially the entire student body."
