# More Discussion Needed In Campus Organizations, Dr. Cottrell Tells Women
## Housing Committee Gives Report, Constitution Revision Discussed At Women's Conference Meeting 
### 
The following subjects were dis
cussed at Women's Conference yes
terday:
1. Parliamentary procedure.
2. Housing Committee report.
:i. Revision of the Conference
constitution.
4. Introduction of new officers.
The main fault of organizations on
campus .such as Women's Confer
ence is that there is little if any dis
cussion on important matters and
there is no order of business, said
Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, professor of
political science.
He was conducting a leadership
forum on parliamentary procedure
in club meetings. Students on rep
resentative bodies such as Confer
ence or Excom do not actually pre
sent the points of view of the peo
ple they represent, he said. It is
the fault of the students as a whole
who take a passive attitude because
they think things are being handed
down to them from the top as well
as the leaders who do not enter into
discussions.
Business Order Needed
"There should be a definite order
of at. all meetings," Dr.
Cottrell said. He suggested having a
roll call, minutes of previous actions,
reports of standing committees, re
ports of special committees, and
then the order of the day, which is
something that should be definitely
decidcd today and should take pref
erence over everything else.
Then unfinished business can be
taken up, new business, and ad
journment.
The presiding officer should be
more or less of a dictator, he be
lieves. He should keep order, have a
system of recognition, raise ques
tions, and announce voting results.
The secretary should keep accurate
records on all business. There
should also be a formality for dis
cussing questions.
Housing Report Given
Guy la Runyan, Roble president,
reviewed the housing program and
Cave the freshman opinion of it.
"The girls all have their own opin
ions of it," she said, "and only one
half of the program is over; after
next year it will be easier to criti
cize the program."
Freshmen liked the lot system and

the social program, although tliey
thought it should be started earlier
next year, taking care not to start
it so early that it would keep the
freshmen from becoming unified in
their own halls.
(iives Suggestions
Miss Runyan suggested that in
future living group drawings, each
girl fill out the entire card in order
of her preference so she will not
have to he asked lo fill out addi
tional choices. She also thought
girls should be told how living group
changcs can be made at the end of
a quarter and during a quarter if
vacancies nrisc.
Marylou McClure, A.S.S.U. vice
president and Housing Committee
chairman, reviewed the six points

mittee had decided that graduate
women would not be able to live in
their former houses next year un
less all undergraduates and new
women had been placcd and there
were still vacancies.

They may be able to eat their
meals there, however, she said.
Housing Committee will be contin
ued next year to work on the quota
system, which could not be taken
care of very well this year, vacan
cies, and the social program.

with the A.S.S.U. constitution when
it is passed. Lorrain Streblow, Ro
ble head sponsor ,rcad some of the

thought it should be started earlier

(iives Suggestions
Miss Runyan suggested that in
future living group drawings, each
girl fill out the entire card in order
of her preference so she will not

a quarter and during a quarter if
vacancies nrisc.
Marylou McClure, A.S.S.U. vice

Committee to Continue
They may be able to eat their

Housing Committee will be contin

system, which could not be taken
care of very well this year, vacan

Women's Conference constitution
will be revised so as to be in line
with the A.S.S.U. constitution when

The main fault of organizations on
campus .such as Women's Confer
ence is that there is little if any dis
cussion on important matters and
there is no order of business, said
Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, professor of
political science.
He was conducting a leadership
forum on parliamentary procedure
in club meetings. Students on rep
resentative bodies such as Confer
ence or Excom do not actually pre
sent the points of view of the peo
ple they represent, he said. It is
the fault of the students as a whole
who take a passive attitude because
they think things are being handed
down to them from the top as well
as the leaders who do not enter into
discussions.
Business Order Needed
"There should be a definite order
of at. all meetings," Dr.
Cottrell said. He suggested having a
roll call, minutes of previous actions,
reports of standing committees, re
ports of special committees, and
then the order of the day, which is
something that should be definitely
decidcd today and should take pref
erence over everything else.
Then unfinished business can be
taken up, new business, and ad
journment.
The presiding officer should be
more or less of a dictator, he be
lieves. He should keep order, have a
system of recognition, raise ques
tions, and announce voting results.
The secretary should keep accurate
records on all business. There
should also be a formality for dis
cussing questions.
