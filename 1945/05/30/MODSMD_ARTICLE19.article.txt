## 
### 
"American missionaries in the
Hawaiian Islands during the last
century had a profound influence on
the people, culture, and history of
the islands which has lasted until
this day," said Dr. Harold W. Brad
ley, associate professor of history,
yesterday in discussing what will
be the topic for his American Stud
ies lecture tomorrow.
The legacy left by the greatest
missionary expedition ever sent out
by the American churches has be
come part of the history of the is
lands. Its reasons and the men who
carried it out will be discussed in
this last of the spring quarter Sym
posium lectures.
Dr. Bradley has studied the per
sonal letters and published reports
of the missionaries who went to the
islands around the years from 1820
to 1850. His book "The American
Frontier in the Hawaiian Islands"
was published in 1942.
This is Dr. Bradley's fifteenth and
last year at Stanford, for next year
he is going to Claremont College to
assume the position of Dean of the
Graduate School.
Dr. Bradley will begin his talk,
"American Missionaries in the Ha
waiian Islands â€” A Summary and
Estimate," at 4:15 in the lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
