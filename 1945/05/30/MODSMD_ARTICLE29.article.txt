# Stanford Daily Editorials—Features
## DEAR SKID- 
### 
I think you know how I have looked upon
this edit that I am bound by tradition to write
to the losing candidate in our staff election, as
the task I have most regretted doing in this
long time on the Daily.
On the Daily there is really no loser in this
election, as unanimously you have been made
Ihe managing editor of Volume 108; for you
and Helen, your volume. The staff has faced a
job of choosing between you, and I know it
is everyone's feeling, that it was a job no
mortal could wish for.
To you will go a little less of the glory, a
lot more of the anonymous pitching in, shifting
of beats, and headaches over features, soothing
of copyreaders, detection of editorial sense, that
few people will ever realize you alone can do.
On the Daily there are two bosses, though
only one represents it, in person, to outsiders.
In a way you will find it an advantage to have
the satisfaction of keeping this beloved rag
pulsating to what's being and doing in our
Stanford world, without the pressure of com
mittees and the hypocrisy of the immature, al
ways jockeying for position they think the
paper can give them. In all this the only place
Helen can turn, is to you.
No one has better represented the spirit, the
character, or whatever you want to call it, that
has enabled the Daily to meet it everyday de
mands both on and off the staff. Skidmore is a
Daily legend for all who have worked with
you; with Helen, you could be depended upon
for head copy editing as a freshman, Night
Editing and Associate Editing as a sopho
more, and always, the backbone of a demand
ing institution during its great trial through the
disintegrating influence of war and what we
hope is a successful war tradition of its own.
I am presumptuous to tell you what all this
means to the Daily and to you; like the others
in a long line of has-beens, I want to think I
can indicate some part of its greatness to you.
The respect and admiration which I owe you
more truly speak of the job you will do. It's
yours to make of this rag what you will; don't
miss it.— Bern.
