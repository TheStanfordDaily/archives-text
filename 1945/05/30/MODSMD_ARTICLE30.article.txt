# THE 						LAST ROSE OF SUMMER
## 
### 
And this year the Quad comes out in the Sum
mer. Last year the Editor had to resign. The
Quad story is a sad one that has lingered over
the campus every spring guarter for too long
now.
It's a cinch that the hard work reguired over
there could not be indicative of the spirit shown
at the top of the staff. It looks like things are
starting out again that way this Spring, and it
seems time that the powers that be should get
hold of themselves and give the institution a
fair chance to accredit itself justly and fairly
come the 1946 yearbook.
