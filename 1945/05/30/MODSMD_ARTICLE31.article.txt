### PEGGY FITTS 
I would like to say a few words about my
class before it passes out of the Stanford picture
as an active unit and resolves itself into another
numbered plaque in front of the Chapelâ€”the
(lass of hardy perennials, the class of '45.
This is the class that saw, as freshmen, the
beginning of two wars, and has seen, as seniors,
the victorious conclusion of one of them. This
is the class that brought home the Axe from
the last Big Game. This is the class that re
members city dates and big-name bands and
train rallies and 2:30 late leaves. This is the
class that stood in the Cellar the day we went
to v/ar, that studied for its first finals in blacked
out rooms, that filed to the air-raid shelters a
couple of nights every week, never without a
flicker of wondering whether this time it would
be the real thing.
When the green members of this class
walked into Memorial Hall in September of
1341 for their first official meeting, the Pre-
Reg Committee had a song for us which ended,
"Take it from us, we give it to you, '45!" That
committee only knew a very little of what they
were giving us- one final quarter of Stanford
life as they had known it, and then three years

of transition, three years of discard and inno
vation, of hard work and play that was not so
easily come by, of growing up to the reality
of a different world and the prospect of a better
one.
Our time at Stanford is just about over; it
was sometimes a bewildering time, not often an
easy time, but it never stopped being a good,
time. Like every class before us, we have had
our four years, bought and paid for, at one of
the pleasantest places in the world; we found it
that way and we'll leave it that way. If this is
any kind of a victory, a little of it belongs to
those green freshmen of 1941 who took what
was given to them and made the best of it.
Take it from us. We give it to you.
