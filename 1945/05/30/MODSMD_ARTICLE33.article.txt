Secretary of State Stettinius announced to llie
world m a speech Monday five points in the United
States foreign policy of the future, upon which world
security from war can be realized.
The points are final and complete victory over Japan
and adoption of measures so that Germany and Japan
are never able to wage war again. The United Slates
must maintain and extend the collaboration and com
munity of purpose now existing among the great na
tions which have fought the war together, since the
interests of this country extend to the whole world.
Full contribution by this country toward the esta
blishment in practice of the supremacy of justice and
of fair dealing for all peoples and states, large and
small, together with speedy advancement of interna
tional law to meet changing world conditions.
Advancement of social and economic conditions
which create a climate for peace in the world. Com
plete abandonment of isolationism and an American
realization that no longer is the sovereignty of any
nation, not even the most powerful, absolute.
Secretary Stettinius elaborated that we can never
again turn our backs upon the world. If we do not
assume our responsibility willingly then the necessity
of self-preservation may force us to do so.
Not only will the world security organization prevent
aggression, but it will develop the economic and social
conditions that create a climate of peace. Encourage
ment will be given peoples everywhere to apply equal
justice and to promote and protect human freedoms
and rights.
He said the United States would continue to exert
influence as a mediator between the United States,
so that the war time solidarity reached by the Allies
may be continued and strengthened in peace.
He stated that the Big Five must agree unanimously
on any action taken to enforce peace; hence the veto
powers proposed for each of the Big Five on the Secur
ity Council are necessary, as if a single big power
disagreed war would very likely ensue.
This veto of course does not apply to the right of
any nation to bring a dispute before the Council. He
said that the United States will seek provisions safe
guarding its control over strategic areas in the Pacific
necessary for world security, within the limits of the
trusteeship system.
A Commission on Human Rights has been delegated
to prepare a decloration of human rights which will
become the fundamental law of the United Nations.
These rights will be based on President Franklin
Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, freedom from want, and
from fear, and freedom of speech and religion.
The World Charter will be strengthened by naming
the Economic and Social Councils as the principle
organs of the world organization along with the Se
curity Council and the General Assembly.
He concluded with the statement, "We must choose
between a constantly expanding economy throughout
the world or mass unemployment in our own country.
Full participation in the Economic and Social Council
provides us with our greatest opportunity to end the
vicious circle of isolationism, depression, and war."
This significant speech is worthy of consideration by
every thinking American citizen.

so that the war time solidarity reached by the Allies
may be continued and strengthened in peace.
He stated that the Big Five must agree unanimously
on any action taken to enforce peace; hence the veto
powers proposed for each of the Big Five on the Secur
ity Council are necessary, as if a single big power
disagreed war would very likely ensue.
This veto of course does not apply to the right of
any nation to bring a dispute before the Council. He
said that the United States will seek provisions safe
guarding its control over strategic areas in the Pacific
necessary for world security, within the limits of the
trusteeship system.
A Commission on Human Rights has been delegated
to prepare a decloration of human rights which will
become the fundamental law of the United Nations.
These rights will be based on President Franklin
Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, freedom from want, and
from fear, and freedom of speech and religion.
The World Charter will be strengthened by naming
the Economic and Social Councils as the principle
organs of the world organization along with the Se
curity Council and the General Assembly.
He concluded with the statement, "We must choose
between a constantly expanding economy throughout
the world or mass unemployment in our own country.
Full participation in the Economic and Social Council
provides us with our greatest opportunity to end the
vicious circle of isolationism, depression, and war."
This significant speech is worthy of consideration by
every thinking American citizen.
Secretary of State Stettinius announced to llie
world m a speech Monday five points in the United
States foreign policy of the future, upon which world
security from war can be realized.
The points are final and complete victory over Japan
and adoption of measures so that Germany and Japan
are never able to wage war again. The United Slates
must maintain and extend the collaboration and com
munity of purpose now existing among the great na
tions which have fought the war together, since the
interests of this country extend to the whole world.
Full contribution by this country toward the esta
blishment in practice of the supremacy of justice and
of fair dealing for all peoples and states, large and
small, together with speedy advancement of interna
tional law to meet changing world conditions.
Advancement of social and economic conditions
which create a climate for peace in the world. Com
plete abandonment of isolationism and an American
realization that no longer is the sovereignty of any
nation, not even the most powerful, absolute.
Secretary Stettinius elaborated that we can never
again turn our backs upon the world. If we do not
assume our responsibility willingly then the necessity
of self-preservation may force us to do so.
Not only will the world security organization prevent
aggression, but it will develop the economic and social
conditions that create a climate of peace. Encourage
ment will be given peoples everywhere to apply equal
justice and to promote and protect human freedoms
and rights.
He said the United States would continue to exert
influence as a mediator between the United States,
so that the war time solidarity reached by the Allies
may be continued and strengthened in peace.
