(»AI>S, THE CHAPPIE
To the Editor:
As readers of your rival publication, Ike Chapar
ral, we would like to reply to that unwarranted at
tack on the Chappie printed in your May 29 issue.
Contrary to what the "Conservatives" say, we feel
that the Chaparral has done an excellent job during
the last year, especially in view of the difficulties it
has faced as a result of the war. We, and we believe
most of the students on campus, buy the Chappie be
cause we like it and not out of charity, as the "Con
servatives" admittedly do. It is hardly necessary to
point out that if the "Conservatives" don't like the
magazine they don't have to buy it.
As to the use of color, if the editors see fit to use
color in order to put out better looking Chappies,
more power to them. We seriously doubt if color is
being used because of lack of material. More likely,
the color will be the frosting on the cake, to use a
hackneyed analogy.
In conclusion, if the "Esquire" takeoff is half as
good as the "Life" takeoff of two years ago, it will
be a very fine issue. We have heard that it will Ik 1
as good as the "Life" issue. Down with conservatism.

(Editorial Note: We regret the delay in printing
ibis Opinion about a Daily editorial of several days
ago, but as it did not come addressed to Campus
Opinion we were not sure that we had permission
to publish it; we make amends).
Editor:
Your editorial of May 21, headed "Free Speech"
bewails the fact that the Mark Hopkins denied to
Gerald L. K. Smith the use of its ballroom for a
speech. You talk about "the implications of democrat
ic freedom of speech."
May I point out that there is nothing in "freedom
of speech," either from ihe constitutional point of
view or as a democratic principle, which imposes an
obligation upon a hotelkeeper to let Gerald L. K.
Smith use its premises for speech-making. If Smith
stays clear of the Espionage Act he doubtless is en
titled to a soapbox in the parks. I have not heard that
this has been denied him. Until it has, I take issue with
your statement that he has been "denied the right
to speak."
"Democratic principles" ought not to lend us into
soft-headed thinking. No one of use, whether he owns
a hotel, a home, or a vacant lot, has a duty to place
his property at the disposal of the arrogant enemies
of democracy. You would recognize this quickly
enough if Smith were applying for a meeting in Me-
Morial Hall.
Yours very truly,
L. TURRENTINE.
