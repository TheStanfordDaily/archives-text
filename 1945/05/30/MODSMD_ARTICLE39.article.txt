### 
"Physical Chemistry and Life
Phenomena" will be the subject of
Pierre Van Rysselberghe's talk
when he speaks to a biology semi
nar this afternoon at 4:30 in room
430, Jordan Hall.
Dr. Van Rysselberghe is now pro
fessor of chemistry, College of Lib
eral Arts, at the University of Ore
gon. He received his degree of en
gineering from the University of
Brussels in 1927, after which he
came to Stanford as a fellow of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium,
Educational Foundation. He re
ceived his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
at Stanford while on the fellowship,
later becoming connected with the
Department of Chemistry here.
His subject will deal with the ap
plication of thermodynamics to bio
logical processes, a topic in which
he has lately become interested. This
fact enables him to give a more
fundamental explanation of the re
lation of absolute rates of biological
processes.
The seminar will be preceded by
tea at 4 p.m. Faculty, students, and
visitors are welcome.
