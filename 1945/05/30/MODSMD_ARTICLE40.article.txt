WASHINGTON, Wednesday. May
30 (UP). —Japan fired its chief of the
Naval General Staff today and re
placed him with the commander of
the combined fleet, and named an
obscure vice-admiral to lead re
mains of the battered navy against
powerful American and British
fleets.
The shake-up would be similar
to the United States firing Admiral
Ernest J. King, replacing him with
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and

I putting a three-star admiral in
charge of the Pacific Fleet.
