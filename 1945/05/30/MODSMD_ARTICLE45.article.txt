# International Club Is Creator of Good Will
## 
### KEN SCHUG 
While the rest of the world has
been slowly waking up to the im
portance of international goodwill,
the Stanford International Club has
i been generating individual friend-
I ship and goodwill among its stu
dent members. For the past six
years, Farm students from many
nations have played together and
thought together and in this way
have come to a better understand
ing of other lands and other peo
ples.
In 1938. when Mr. and Mrs. Ed
win J. Thomas and their daughter
returned from a trip to the Orient,
they decided the formation of an In
ternational Club at Stanford would
be an important contribution to the
job of helping students from all
over the world to learn to know
each other as individuals who could
co-operate to make the world a little
better place to live.
One of the primary problems of
the"I" Club has been to break
the ice for new students from other
countries. That they have succeeded
in doing this can be easily seen by
the friendly, informal spirit of their
meetings.
Twenty-five countries have been
represented by members in the Club
since its start, according to the rec
ords of Mrs. Thomas, who keeps a
record of all the people who attend
meetings.of her club. The Thomases
not only founded the"I" Club, but
have made their home available for
its meetings, which are held every
: other Sunday evening. In addition,
Mr. Thomas serves as the cook for
their dinner meetings, and can turn
out some delicious foreign and
American dishes, according to club
J members.
The programs of the club include
social affairs such as picnics, dinners

and movies, and talks and discus
sions by faculty and students on
topics of interest to the members.
Among the speakers who have ap
peared at club meetings are Dr.
Spiegelberg, Dean Bunn, Dr. Le-
Maitre, Dr. Sah, and Dr. Brandt.
David Jacobson of the President's
Office has also shown interest in
club activities.
During the past year the presi
dents of the"I" Club have been Es
ther Belew, Servet Duran, and Bob
Myhre, with Myhre the present
president. Servet Duran, an engi
neering student from Turkey, was
mainly responsible for the rejuve
nation of the club after his arrival
in the spring of 1944. He served as
president in the spring and autumn
quarters of 1944.
In addition to president Bob
Myhre, other officers at the present
time are Claire Tolnay, vice-presi
dent; Nancy Witherspoon, secre
tary; and Mary Ethel Robinson,
treasurer. Some of the plans for the
near future are a dinner to be pre
pared by the Turkish students as is
done in Turkey and folk dancing
parties featuring dances from all
lands.
The principal long-term objective
of the organization is the establish
ment of an International House at
Stanford, similar to the houses in
Chicago, Berkeley, and New York,
where students from all over the
world live together. Dr. Virgil An
derson is the head of a committee
investigating the possibility for such
a house at Stanford.
The purpose of the"I" Club as
stated in the constitution might well
serve as a guide to all of us who are
now living in "one world." "To in
culcate friendship among Stanford
students from all countries regard
less of nationality, creed, religion*
or color; to create a better under
standing between the members of
various countries; to hold meetings
for social intercourse and discussion
of subjects of interest to all mem
bers."
