### 
"Of all the countries on earth,
China presents the biggest challenge
I to the map-maker," James M. Dar
ley, chief cartographer of the Na
tional Geographic Society, said
j when the Society's new map of
| China was recently completed. The
ten-color chart will be a supplement
to the June issue of the National
Geographic Magazine.
The chart is released just as war
conscious America turns its full at
tention to the remaining battle area
—the Pacific. With 7,986 names and
covering large areas adjacent to
China—Japan, Formosa, and Luzon
on the east; Burma and India on the
south; and Soviet Republics on the
north and west—armchair strate
gists may easily follow the world
conflict until V-J Day.
Copies of the map of China are
available only at the headquarters
of the National Geographic Society,
16th and M Streets, N.W., Washing
ton 6, D.C.
