# Army, Civilians Meet In All-Star Game Tonight
## 
### BOB GILKEY 
The 1945 intramural Softball sea-
I son comes to a thrilling climax on
the Sunken Diamond this evening at
6:45 with the playing of the widely
heralded All-Star contest, which
features the All-Star teams of the
Army and civilian leagues. This
tussle should certainly stir up in
terest in Stanford sports circles since
it brings together the cream of the
Softball talent on the campus. The
two clubs have been carefully cho
sen, and the game promises to be a
thriller from start to finish.
An accurate prediction of the out
come of the game is somewhat dif
ficult, since the Army team repre
sents a rather unknown quantity.
The soldiers have been playing their
schedule every Wednesday evening
in comparative obscurity, but they
have plenty of material from which
to select a formidable ball club.
They are quite confident of their
ability to whip their more-publi
cized opponents, and stated that they
expect to "kick the pie" out of the
civilian ten. Whether they win or
lose, however, it's a cinch they're
not going to be a pushover.
The civilian All-Star team, which
was selected by the Daily sports
staff at the conclusion of the regular
season, is more widely known. The
third-place Phi Psi team has placed
four men on the team, as against
three each for the pennant-winning
Monroe Boozers and the fourth
place Tyler Hilltoppers. Med School

and Buchanan are each represented
by a single player.
The civilians are well staffed in
the pitching department, where Joe
Sher of Monroe and Luke Pitts of
Phi Psi handle the mound chores.
Bob Stephens, the other half of the
potent Phi Psi battery, is behind the
plate.
The infield is another strong point
for the civilians. Ed Luce of Monroe
on first, Bob Rosburg of Monroe on
second, Doc Mason of the Medical
School at the <phort patch, and Tom
Ashley of Phi Psi on third comprise
an extremely powerful combination.
In the outfield, Bob Slobe of Tyler
in left, Bob Nesbit of Phi Psi in cen
ter, Frank Hoffman of Buchanan in
right, and Dennis Fox of Tyler in
short center represent a hard-hitting
quartet which can give the Army
twirlers plenty of trouble. Joe Pick
ering, Tyler first sacker, is a mighty
valuable utility man, and his power
ful slugging is a strong addition to
the civilian line-up.
Coach Harry Wolter, who has
handled the softball program all
season, certainly deserves a sincere
vote of thanks for his efforts in
making tonight's contest possible,
and we hope he will be rewarded
with a large turnout of enthusiastic
fans.

vote of thanks for his efforts in
making tonight's contest possible,
and we hope he will be rewarded
with a large turnout of enthusiastic
fans.
The 1945 intramural Softball sea-
I son comes to a thrilling climax on
the Sunken Diamond this evening at
6:45 with the playing of the widely
heralded All-Star contest, which
features the All-Star teams of the
Army and civilian leagues. This
tussle should certainly stir up in
terest in Stanford sports circles since
it brings together the cream of the
Softball talent on the campus. The
two clubs have been carefully cho
sen, and the game promises to be a
thriller from start to finish.
An accurate prediction of the out
come of the game is somewhat dif
ficult, since the Army team repre
sents a rather unknown quantity.
The soldiers have been playing their
schedule every Wednesday evening
in comparative obscurity, but they
have plenty of material from which
to select a formidable ball club.
They are quite confident of their
ability to whip their more-publi
cized opponents, and stated that they
expect to "kick the pie" out of the
civilian ten. Whether they win or
lose, however, it's a cinch they're
not going to be a pushover.
The civilian All-Star team, which
was selected by the Daily sports
staff at the conclusion of the regular
season, is more widely known. The
third-place Phi Psi team has placed
four men on the team, as against
three each for the pennant-winning
Monroe Boozers and the fourth
place Tyler Hilltoppers. Med School

and Buchanan are each represented
by a single player.
The civilians are well staffed in
the pitching department, where Joe
Sher of Monroe and Luke Pitts of
Phi Psi handle the mound chores.
Bob Stephens, the other half of the
potent Phi Psi battery, is behind the
plate.
The infield is another strong point
for the civilians. Ed Luce of Monroe
on first, Bob Rosburg of Monroe on
second, Doc Mason of the Medical
School at the <phort patch, and Tom
Ashley of Phi Psi on third comprise
an extremely powerful combination.
In the outfield, Bob Slobe of Tyler
in left, Bob Nesbit of Phi Psi in cen
ter, Frank Hoffman of Buchanan in
right, and Dennis Fox of Tyler in
short center represent a hard-hitting
quartet which can give the Army
twirlers plenty of trouble. Joe Pick
ering, Tyler first sacker, is a mighty
valuable utility man, and his power
ful slugging is a strong addition to
the civilian line-up.
Coach Harry Wolter, who has
handled the softball program all
season, certainly deserves a sincere
vote of thanks for his efforts in
making tonight's contest possible,
and we hope he will be rewarded
with a large turnout of enthusiastic
fans.
