Hinduism Not Static
Dr. Herbert, in referring to the
Hindu religion said that "Today we
are aware that the old books, ob
jects and rituals of its religious
teachings are still followed." He
added that their religious writings
are more important to them than
the Bible is to Christians. How
ever, he explained, Hinduism is
not static because of the predomi
nance of ancient scripture, but is
now growing in every direction.
The speaker went on to describe
the rejection of material things and
wandering lives of Hindu religious
leaders, involving often the giving
away of all their worldly goods. Dr.
Gupta added that Ihe purpose of
the Hindu is to withdraw from the
confusion of society and establish
equilibrium between himself and
the outside world.
Nun-Existence Goal
Dr. Herbert also described the
state of non-existence which is the
ultimate goal in this process of
withdrawing within oneself, and
which is the primary aim of the
Hindu religion.
In concluding, Dr. Herbert stated
that reports of friction between
Moslems and Hindus in India are
usually false, and that there is no
important quarrel between the two
religious groups. He told of a trip
he took to a region which had been
reported to be the center of tension
between Moslems and Hindus; dur
ing his stay he saw Hindus step
aside to let Moslem processions pass
through their festival grounds.
