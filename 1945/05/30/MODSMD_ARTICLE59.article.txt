## 
### RUTH GUMBRECHT 
Last night in Memorial Hall the
Music Lovers Society, presented
through the courtesy of the Friends
of Music at Stanford, gave the con
cluding program of spring quarter's
Tuesday Evening Series. The artists
participating in the program were
Margaret Tilly, piano; Frances Wie
ner, violin; Alfred Akon, viola; Paul
Rcnzi, flute; and Herman Reinberg,
'cello.
Quartet Number First
The first selection of the evening
was the Quartet, Opus 16, for Piano,
Violin, Viola, and 'Cello by Bee
thoven which was performed in a
well-balanced manner with good
style and fine interpretation of the
composer's dynamics.
The second selection was a Sere
nade for Flute, Violin, and Viola by
Max Reger. The very clear flute
quality of Mr. Renzi was elaborately
displayed in this unusual contrast of
instruments. Considering that the
instruments played in this selection
were of a melodic quality, with a
lack of a bass steadiness found in a
'cello or piano, the artists produced
a very pleasing effect. The tech
nique displayed in the Presto move
ment was an example of precise

rhythm and fine control.
Brahms Selection Liked
The final work, the Quartet, Opus
52, in G Minor for Piano, Violin, Vi
ola and 'Cello by Brahms, was the
piece de resistance. The opening
statement by the piano was tackled
with cool steadiness while the en
trance of the strings showed marked
strength and feeling. The muted
Intermezzo prepared for the An
dante con moto with its marchlike
quality displayed in the bass of the
piano, followed by a robust melody
played in unison by the strings.
The wide vibrato of the violin,
though overdone in the first two se
lections, was well received in this
more stirring movement. The Ron
do alia Zingarese was excellently
interpreted in exciting grace. The
staccato of the violin and viola com
bined with a delicate pattern in the
piano and 'cello displayed the vir
tuosity of each member of the en
semble.
Special mention should be made
of the fine 'cello of Mr. Reinberg
which gave*the audience a rich deep
tone and romantic flavor through
out the concert.

a very pleasing effect. The tech
nique displayed in the Presto move
ment was an example of precise

rhythm and fine control.
Brahms Selection Liked
The final work, the Quartet, Opus
52, in G Minor for Piano, Violin, Vi
ola and 'Cello by Brahms, was the
piece de resistance. The opening
statement by the piano was tackled
with cool steadiness while the en
trance of the strings showed marked
strength and feeling. The muted
Intermezzo prepared for the An
dante con moto with its marchlike
quality displayed in the bass of the
piano, followed by a robust melody
played in unison by the strings.
The wide vibrato of the violin,
though overdone in the first two se
lections, was well received in this
more stirring movement. The Ron
do alia Zingarese was excellently
interpreted in exciting grace. The
staccato of the violin and viola com
bined with a delicate pattern in the
piano and 'cello displayed the vir
tuosity of each member of the en
semble.
Special mention should be made
of the fine 'cello of Mr. Reinberg
which gave*the audience a rich deep
tone and romantic flavor through
out the concert.
