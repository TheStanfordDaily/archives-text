# Russian Speaker To Explain New Healing Vitamin
## 
### 
Dr. Alexander V. Palladin, dele
gate from the Ukrainian Soviet So
cialist Republic to the UNCIO, who
visited the campus last Wednesday,
will return to the campus to give a
talk on his "Biochemical Studies of
Muscular Activity" at the special
seminar in Room 430 Thursday at
4:15 p.m. Tea will be served at 4
p.m. Faculty, students, and visitors
are welcome.
Dr. Palladin is the Director of the
Biochemical Institute at Kiev. His
institute, which moved to the Ural
Mountains during the invasion, is
again functioning in the original
building, ihe shell of which with
stood the war.
The subject on which Dr. Palla
din will talk is one of the many
fields in which he worked. During
the war he has contributed to the
art of healing by the synthesis of a
form of vitamin K, which may be
taken by mouth to shorten the clot
ting time of blood and diminish
bleeding.
Dr. Palladin is a member of the
Academy of Science of the Ukraine
and also of the U.S.S.R. (The latter
is shortly to celebrate its 220 th an
niversary.) He is the son of the
famous plan physiologist.
Dr. Palladin believes that scien
tists throughout the world should
keep in close touch with each oth
er; and thus make a great contribu
tion to world peace through this link
of common scientific interests. He
believes that interest in science is
not incompatible with interest in
public affairs, and demonstrates this
by being both an active researcher
and a diplomat.
