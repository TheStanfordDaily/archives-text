# Japanese Will Return Home
## 
### 
Japanese - Americans — 55,000 of
them—are preparing to leave relo
cation centers for return to their
homes or to comparatively strange
areas near the Pacific Coast.
From the time the centers' schools
permanently close down on June 11
to December 31, when all of these
residents must find new homes, will
be the most difficult period of trans
ition.
Group leadership and interpreta
tion of life outside the centers will
be needed in this period. Students
of Stanford are being offered the
opportunity not only to serve this
minority group but to learn first
hand its problems.
A training conference will be held
in Los Angeles on June 29 and 30,
after which workers will be placed
in the Poston and Gila River relo
cation centers in Arizona for the
period from July 1 to August 31—
all or a part of this time.
