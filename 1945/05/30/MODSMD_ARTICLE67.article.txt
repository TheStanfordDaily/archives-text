# Civil Liberties Discussed At Waverley Club Meeting
## 
### 
"The job of the American Civil Liberties Union is to defend principles
which lie at the heart of the democratic process of the United States," said
Ernest Besig, director of the Northern California ACLU, in a talk to the
Waverly Club Monday night in Palo Alto.
He added that the organization tries to protect the civil liberties of all

with no distinction on account of
color, race, politics or economic
views.
Active 25 Years
The national organization has
been in operation for 25 years, dur
ing which time it has dedicated it
self to the task of defending civil
liberties under the Constitution of
the United States, explained the
speaker.
A 70 member executive committee
formulates the policies of the ACLU,
said Mr. Besig, and local groups
throughout the country operate un
der its direction. Among the mem
bers of the Northern California
committee is Rev. Oscar Green of
Palo Alto.
After these introductory explan
ations of the Civil Liberties Union,
the speaker enumerated a few of the
many interesting cases in which the
Union has been involved.
One of the most important victor
ies of the ACLU, recalled Mr. .Be
sig, was the case of Fred Edwards,
a migratory worker who was ar
rested in Marysville in 1939 under
the "anti-Okie" law, for helping his
indigent brother-in-law to enter
the state of California. Upon appeal
from a superior court decision, the
case was heard twice by the United
States Supreme Court, which hand
ed down a 9-0 decision in 1941, de
claring the "anti-Okie" laws uncon
stitutional.
Tar and Feather Party
A case of mob violence in 1935
illustrated the difficulty which the
ACLU faces in many cases. A tar
and feather party was inflicted on
five men in Santa Rosa accused of
being "radicals" because they were
planning to organize the apple pick
ers, but the ACLU was unable to
obtain prosecution by the local au
thorities. although many of the vig
ilantes were known. They finally
persuaded the State Attorney-Gen
eral to prosecute, but since the trial
was held in Santa Rosa, the guilty
men were acquitted by their towns
men.
Another case discussed by the
speaker was the flag salute issue
raised by Jehovah's Witnesses, re
fusal to pledge allegiance to the
Flag. After two adverse decisions
by the U. S. Supreme Court, a
third case resulted in the ruling
that no one can be forced to salute
or pledge allegiance to the Flag, a
decision which was based on the
freedom of speech.
Fight for the Vote
A more recent example enum
erated by Mr. Besig as fine of sev
eral involving racial issues, was
the attempt of the Native Sons of
the Golden West to prevent Ameri
can citizens of Japanese ancestry
from voting by claiming that the
14th Amendment was intended only
for Caucasians. This attempt at dis
franchisement was defeated in Dis
trict and Circuit courts and the Su
preme Court would not even hear
the case upon appeal.
Mr. Besig said that he is now
working on a case in which a sailor
had been held for nine months in
the Mare Island brig with no charges
being filed against him. and that
charges were finally entered only
when the ACLU heard of the situa
tion and protested to Navy officials.
In concluding, the speaker said,
"none can be secure unless all are
secure; the fight for civil liberties
is a job of constantly rcwinning
them."
