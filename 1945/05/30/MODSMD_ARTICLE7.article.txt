SAN FRANCISCO, May 29 (UP).

Nations security issue which appar
ently had been settled, and there
were signs that the parley may be
prolonged until at least June 11.
At France's request the Big Five
were callcd together to change the
language of the important section of
the regional security proposals, and
during a two-hour meeting the Big
Five chairman reviewed the Con
ference committee organization and
ordered a detailed study which
might indicate an extension beyond
the unofficial adjournment deadline
of June 6.
What had been considered one of
the Conference's closed matters, the
regional security issue, was re
opened when Fiance sought to
change the language which would
benefit such bilateral treaties as she
now has with Russia.
