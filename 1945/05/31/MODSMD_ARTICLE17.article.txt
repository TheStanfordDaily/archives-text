# Postwar Stanford Expects Many More Students Says Dean Bunn

(Kditorial note: This is the tenth
in our series of articles on Stan- [
ford's postwar outlook.)
A student body equal to the
maximum of accommodations is
expected at postwar Stanford by
Dr. John YV. ISunn, dean of men.
when asked his view*! of what is
to come.
Because of limited housing facili
ties with the return of the service
men, it is his expectation that wom
en's registration will have to be cut
down. But Dean Bunn hoped
that the co-educational registration
would have a better balance, espe
cially for social reasons, than it did
when only 500 women were en
rolled.
"Stanford has long visualized
enhanced facilities for residences
for men." he said. It is his guess
that in the postwar period hous
ing facilities with more capacity
will be seriously considered.
Correspondence shows that for- .
mer students whose education has ;

been interrupted are coming back
and a heavy return to school is
planned on after the Japanese war
When asked liis ideas about the
training methods used in the

speeded-up Army programs and
whether or not they will lÂ»e
adopted at Stanford. Dean Bunn
said lie "liopcd class time would
not he quickened because it is not
sound educationally."
The new procedures used are
all right at the time to fit a spe
cial need, he feels, but it would
not he good to keep it up, mainly
because it docs not allow time
for other activities.
"Changes will come in the types
of courses themselves, rather than
in pressure programs," Dean Bunn
explained. As an example of this
trend he told of the School of Hu
manities area studies, where em- i
phasis is being placed on Russian, j
Chinese, and Latin - American j
courses. "Dr. Wilbur has proposed 5
this for years," he laughed, "but we
are only now at a point where we
accept it. We didn't visualize the i
need for them before."
Mathematics will become more
popular, lie thinks, for the need
for it has been shown during the
war. "There was somewhat of a
trend in this direction even he-

fore the war, Ixit both mathe
matics and engineering wartime
courses have had bigger enroll
ment, even with the women stu
dents."
We asked Dean Bunn about bis
other ideas on Stanford life after
the war, and for his ideas on ath
letics in particular. "The war has
demonstrated the necessity of ath
letic competition," he said, and he
expects that Stanford will return to
athletics as soon as conditions, in
cluding transportation, permit. The
competition need not be wholly in
tercollegiate.
Dean Bunn also sees the need
for a better provided-fur social
program. Some of his suggestions
were more places to read and
lounge, a larger Music Listening
Room, and places to dance. In
general, a rounding out of the
present program to lit the resident
University.
"There is hound to be develop
ment in these places, and the post
war period will give us an oppor
tunity to realize them," he con
cluded.
