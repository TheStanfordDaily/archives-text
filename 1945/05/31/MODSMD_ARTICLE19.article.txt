aries in the Hawaiian Islands â€” A
Summary and Estimate." He will

ried it out will be discussed by Dr.
Bradley in this last of the spring
quarter symposium lectures.
He has studied the personal let
ters and published reports of mis
sionaries who went to the islands
around the years from 1820 to 1850,
and in 942 publlishcd "The Ameri
can Frontier in the Hawaiian Is
lands."
