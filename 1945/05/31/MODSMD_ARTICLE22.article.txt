# Friendly Farm Spirit Praised By Graduate Excom Member

(Editorial note: This is the ninth in our series of articles on Stanford's
present and postwar outlook.)
"Stanford offers innumerable opportunities to make interesting friends,"
said Geraldine Fit/.Gerald, graduate member of Excom and tap and Gown
member. She listed that fact as one of the things she liked best about
Stanford; not only meeting people from all over the world, hut being ahle

â™¦to make lifelong friendships with
them in the informal atmosphere of
our houses and dormitories.
Student Weaknesses
"Stanford has its weaknesses too,"
admitted Miss Fit/.Gerald. Too many
students neglect the unusual oppor
tunities here. They stay home from
concerts, plays, and lectures, while
people come eagerly from Palo Alto
and Mcnlo Park for these same
events. Tlicy miss many line sports
j opportunities too, including hikes
and tennis matches. Stanford has
one of the finest golf courses in the
country, but very few students have
played on it.
Stanford offers chances for stu
j dents to know their faculty very
| well, but few students utilize these
J opportunities fully. They still seem
a little in awe of their professors.
Fine Student Government
We have potentially the finest
student government in the country.
It has tremendous responsibility,
and especially with the area repre
sentation plan, it is very close to the
students. But they themselves arc
to blame for its failures. In the
last election only 53 per cent voted,
and that was a better rccord than
usual. All too few of us run for
offices or apply for committees.
"Graduate dormitories arc one of
j Stanford's most urgent postwar
needs," Miss FitzGerald said. Hill
! top House will hold only 14 women,
i and the rest of our graduate stu-
I dents have a discouraging search for
j homes. Postwar dormitories would
| stimulate students to do graduate
i work.
