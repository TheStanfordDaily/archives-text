## 
### 
Calling a joint session of Cardinals and Excom, and voting unanimously
that visitors leave the room, Excom last night approved Lylc Davis, IWary
lou MeClure, Nancy Banning, and Frank de Lisle as new members on
Cardinals.

The two organizations went into joint session following the debate con-

cerning the selection of members as
stated in the proposed amendment
to the Cardinals charter. Cardinals
wanted only their first choices sub
mitted before Excom, rather than
two names for each position as pro
vided by the charter. A suggested
compromise, having a list of alter
nates withheld until one of the
first-choice nominees had been dis
approved, was voted down by Ex
com. Since the three-fourths vote

manner in which Cardinals mem
bers should be selected in the fu
ture. Cardinals' recommendation

twice been voted down.
