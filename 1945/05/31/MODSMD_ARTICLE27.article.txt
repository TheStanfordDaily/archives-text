NUERNBKKG, May .",0 (UP).â€”
William Joyce, the British traitor
whose propaganda broadcasts over
the German radio earned him in
famy as "Lord Haw-Haw," lay in a
British hospital tonight guarded by
British sentries and attended by
three Irish nurses.
Joyce underwent a successful op
eration today for the removal of a
bullet from his thigh. He was
wounded by one of the British offi
cers who arrested him.
