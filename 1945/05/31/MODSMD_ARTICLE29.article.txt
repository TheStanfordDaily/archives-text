STANFORD
We saw a squib in the Chronicle yesterday
that foretold a news story which cannot be
confined to the few inches allotted to it. It
merely told statistically that troop ships were
leaving every day from Europe, and Americans
were coining home, many to be released -from
the service. The great change that we have
seen in the last half dozen years is about to
be erased as insidiously with such puzzling
shock as it made when it came. Before we
can philosophize about what has happened,
things will gradually be reassembling them
selves in as nearly whole a way as this world
can ever return to.
This year's freshmen will not have to think
about this year when they are Stanford sen
iors, just as this year's seniors can hardly
remember "back when" they were frosh.
It's been a human fallacy to think of peace
as something to return to; we know it is a
movement forward to something for a school
that will, as always, be able to cope with
the future and changing times.
We have gained much from our experience
here, perhaps it is because in our lives, four
years is, as yet, a long time to spend any
where, but we think too, that Stanford is an
exceptional place, where the state, the grounds,
the spirit, and the people are able to acquire
values of uncommon worth. -
In passing from a voice here on the Daily,
we would like to pass on some things that
are merely a student's voice.
We would like to be assured that Stanford
would not succumb, as we know it is the fad
in gay old postwar years to do, to the short
cuts, and hurry-ups, and most of all the fluffy
dress that is being given to academic work,
to make it seem new and perhaps more pain
less. We know that essentially it boils down
to how much we value an academic stand
ing, and assuming that we would not be here
otherwise, that students essentially are able
to learn chiefly because of the kind of pro
lessors they have, what those professors
know, and equally important, how well those
professors can convey what they know.
Facility Rating
We think that Stanford has fallen short in
giving recognition to professors who have had
extraordinary capacity to influence students
seriously, even though Stanford will not fail
in trying to get the best people to come here.
We think that an improvement could be
made by copying the example of other schools
and having a committee of students and fac
ulty compile a book regularly, rating all people
who teach at Stanford in a way that means
something to students who always are asking
about profs, and also seriously done so as to
provide an indication of a professor's primary
job ol teaching for the Academic Council. The
most difficult thing for the University to de
termine is how well people teach, we think
therefore that that has been neglected for
people who look good on the syllabus layout,
and the number of works they publish.
We think this book could be initiated either
through the new Dean of Students who is
coming, or the Associated Students Executive
Committee, itself.
Dean of Students
We also hope that the new Dean of Students
will quickly overcome his introduction to the
campus as a statistician and tester, which
makes over-tested students have their doubts.
If he will show a real interest in the students,
not only for what they ought to be, but what
they want to understand and see done at
Stanford, we think the students v/ill appre
ciate it and not resent it. We ask him not to
wait too long; we have been disillusioned be
fore and are from Missouri in that respect.
A Literary Mag
We hope that from some place there can
come encouragement for a book of literary writ
ing for the campus. It is long overdue; only a
few professors, in an informal way, have man
aged to salvage most worthwhile student writ
ing. There is a great deal at Stanford that
goes without any encouragement and expres
sion.
Student Honor and Councils
We hope also that the administration can do
its part toward clearing up the bitter confus
ion about Social One minute
we understand that we are under an honor
system, in accordance with the Fundamental
Standard, and the next minute we are called
before the council on circumstantial evidence
of an insulting nature because some overzealous

assistants have understood that they are to be
policemen.
Confidence in this respect might show the
council that informality of their meetings does
not excuse the lack of proper respect for a
student's dignity and worth that is necessary
for the acceptance of any kind of justice.
Activities
The least of our worries is that students will
ever omit to cling to the traditions and respon
sibilities of student activities; the activities
have created more character than any philos
ophy taught more than any year at
college, helped to see the value of tolerance,
cooperation, ideas, and work, more than any
mother's knee.
Even so we hope they will never be under
estimated because the University is rightfully
centered around its academic work. It is es
pecially in this strained war period that they
must fight hardest against unconcern and ap
athy.
