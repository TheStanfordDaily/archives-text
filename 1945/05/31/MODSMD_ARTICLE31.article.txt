"All the King's horses and all the King's men," re
cited a voice just above Alice's head, "Couldn't, put
Humpty Dumpty in his place again."
"Oh no!" cried Alice perturbedly as she recognized
Humpty Dumpty, perched on the top of a high brick
wall, "That doesn't come yet—not until after you've
fallen off!"
Humpty Dumpty peered over the edge of the wall.
"In the due course of time, Miss," he said in a truly
restrained tone, "I shall fall off this wall; there is no
use trying to hurry me up."
"Excuse me!" insisted Alice, in a tone that indicated
that she was quite sure of what is right and what is
wrong, "But you shouldn't speak of things that are
going to happen until after they've happened; it shows
a disrespectful attitude towards God."
"Just .because you cannot explain why things hap
pen," said Humpty Dunitpy, lighting an immense
Corona-Corona, "there is no excuse for blaming i(
all onto a convenient bewhiskered Jehovah."
"If it is all unexplainahlc," said Alice, " I find it
best to believe something that is so preposterously
beyond all explanations that it prevents me from
ever expecting to understand anything."
Humpty Dumpty leaned back to balance the weight
of his Corona-Corona until it seemed as though he was
surely going to topple backwards off the wall.
"Explanations for Everything," he said, emitting an
enormous smoke-ring, "are only insisted upon by the
ignorant, in order to maintain the consistency of their
ignorance."
"IJnt how," insisted Alie, who had become quite
irritated at his stubborn perversity, "could you ex
plain the Cellar food, or the Sequoia Barn, or the
Dean of Women, except as a punishment meted out
to ous by some sour old Jehovah?"
Humpty Dumpty scratched the top of his shell
thoughtfully.
"Or for that matter," he added brightly, "how could
the Cellar or Stan Sharp or Dean Mary explain the
moronic ignorance of the students' expectations, ex
cept as the unwonted consequence of an Act of God?"
"What do you mean!" cried Alice angrily, looking
about for a handy boulder, "we are neither morons,
nor are we ignorant; we are Better People, we are
Leaders among the Sheep; we are the people who
make Niceness really Nioe, and decide whether it is
Russia or Japan that we shall (ijjht next."
"I don't see what you're so bitter about," said Hump
ty Dumpty, moving uneasily about in his shell as lie
saw Alice fingering a small but. dangerous rock, "after
all, the Administration has a good hotel, and they
spend twice as much money on the grounds as they
do on the dirty old laboratories."
"Lagunita and laboratories—pish-tush" said Alice,
who was stioll in rather a nasty mood, "those are
trivial things. Look at what they did to the very
core and foundation of our snobbishness in that das
tardly underhand attack on the Fraternities and
Sororities!"
"Come, come," said Humpty Dumpty, eagerly at
tempting to compromise Alice's dangerous mood,
"There's a war on, and you have to give up something.
And after all, your snobbishness isn't really dependent
upon such a small thing as organizations.
"It's a much deeper, sounder, more personal thing,
based on a broad, unfeigned and unconscious ignor
ance—not upon any vulgar scheming selfishness."
"'lhat's*a much better way to look at things," said
Alice, who felt very flattered by Humpty Dumpty's
last remark, "only I wish (hat you would say so
phistication instead of snobbiness; snobbishness is
a horribly blunt way of putting it."
"I do hope you'll forgive me," replied Humpty
Dumpty, shrugging his shoulders at his own lack
ol consideration, "but you see it looks so much like
snobbishness from the outside, that I forget that on
the inside it's really nothing but sophistication."

based on a broad, unfeigned and unconscious ignor
ance—not upon any vulgar scheming selfishness."
"'lhat's*a much better way to look at things," said
Alice, who felt very flattered by Humpty Dumpty's
last remark, "only I wish (hat you would say so
phistication instead of snobbiness; snobbishness is
a horribly blunt way of putting it."
"I do hope you'll forgive me," replied Humpty
Dumpty, shrugging his shoulders at his own lack
ol consideration, "but you see it looks so much like
snobbishness from the outside, that I forget that on
the inside it's really nothing but sophistication."
—SAM ANDERSON.
"All the King's horses and all the King's men," re
cited a voice just above Alice's head, "Couldn't, put
Humpty Dumpty in his place again."
"Oh no!" cried Alice perturbedly as she recognized
Humpty Dumpty, perched on the top of a high brick
wall, "That doesn't come yet—not until after you've
fallen off!"
Humpty Dumpty peered over the edge of the wall.
"In the due course of time, Miss," he said in a truly
restrained tone, "I shall fall off this wall; there is no
use trying to hurry me up."
"Excuse me!" insisted Alice, in a tone that indicated
that she was quite sure of what is right and what is
wrong, "But you shouldn't speak of things that are
going to happen until after they've happened; it shows
a disrespectful attitude towards God."
"Just .because you cannot explain why things hap
pen," said Humpty Dunitpy, lighting an immense
Corona-Corona, "there is no excuse for blaming i(
all onto a convenient bewhiskered Jehovah."
"If it is all unexplainahlc," said Alice, " I find it
best to believe something that is so preposterously
beyond all explanations that it prevents me from
ever expecting to understand anything."
Humpty Dumpty leaned back to balance the weight
of his Corona-Corona until it seemed as though he was
surely going to topple backwards off the wall.
"Explanations for Everything," he said, emitting an
enormous smoke-ring, "are only insisted upon by the
ignorant, in order to maintain the consistency of their
ignorance."
"IJnt how," insisted Alie, who had become quite
irritated at his stubborn perversity, "could you ex
plain the Cellar food, or the Sequoia Barn, or the
Dean of Women, except as a punishment meted out
to ous by some sour old Jehovah?"
Humpty Dumpty scratched the top of his shell
thoughtfully.
"Or for that matter," he added brightly, "how could
the Cellar or Stan Sharp or Dean Mary explain the
moronic ignorance of the students' expectations, ex
cept as the unwonted consequence of an Act of God?"
"What do you mean!" cried Alice angrily, looking
about for a handy boulder, "we are neither morons,
nor are we ignorant; we are Better People, we are
Leaders among the Sheep; we are the people who
make Niceness really Nioe, and decide whether it is
Russia or Japan that we shall (ijjht next."
"I don't see what you're so bitter about," said Hump
ty Dumpty, moving uneasily about in his shell as lie
saw Alice fingering a small but. dangerous rock, "after
all, the Administration has a good hotel, and they
spend twice as much money on the grounds as they
do on the dirty old laboratories."
"Lagunita and laboratories—pish-tush" said Alice,
who was stioll in rather a nasty mood, "those are
trivial things. Look at what they did to the very
core and foundation of our snobbishness in that das
tardly underhand attack on the Fraternities and
Sororities!"
"Come, come," said Humpty Dumpty, eagerly at
tempting to compromise Alice's dangerous mood,
"There's a war on, and you have to give up something.
And after all, your snobbishness isn't really dependent
upon such a small thing as organizations.
"It's a much deeper, sounder, more personal thing,
based on a broad, unfeigned and unconscious ignor
ance—not upon any vulgar scheming selfishness."
