It seems obvious in "Liberals'" answer to our letter
of ihe 23th that that group is trying desperately to
maintain campus morale hy a rather weak attempt to
whitewash the Chappie.
And we want to tell "Liberals" that we remain
undaunted in our stand against inferior cartoons,
trivial prose, inane poetry, and lousy photographs of
the campus queens. It is wilh dread and horror that
we await the forthcoming issue of the Chappie- in
color.
Ye Gods! Not only must it try to make what will
obviously be only a meager take-off on Esquire, but
it must muff the color angle too. We can see it now:
the queen with blue hair, yellow eyes, and red face
'blushing with embarrassment, no doubt); or the
Mary Alice -a noble aircraft, we grant which, with
colors blurred (as it must he, in the hands of in
competent editors, will be a pain to look upon.
In short, the forthcoming Chappie will not prove
to he a satire on Esquire, hut a satire only on the
Chappie itself.
hut this protest against the policy of Chappie edi
tors to keep trying to outdo themselves is only minor
in comparison to our real grievance against this mag
azine. And that grievance is one and only one -must
it continue to be so inane?
As a reflection of student opinion and the student
mind, the Chappie has failed dismally. For if it has
not failed, then it must have needs become an abso
lute denial of the purpose for which universities, in
cluding Stanford, exist today. We hope that, in this
light, the Chappie has failed.
