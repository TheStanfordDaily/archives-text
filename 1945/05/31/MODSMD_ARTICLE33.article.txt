# Drama Productions Rated as Successful
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
Five plays, an opera, a Gaieites Show, and a Spring Show have been
put on by the Department of Speech and Drama this year, and all add up
to what has been termed as "a very successful year."
The Stanford Players opened the year November 8 wilh an English
comedy by A. A. Milne, "The Dover Road." The lead <>l the eccentric Mr.

Latimer was played by Johnny 4
High.
Characters
Harvey Small, Newton Arnold,
Sally Stocker, and Hazel Spore were
the four young people who came
under Mr. Latimer's jurisdiction,
and he kept them in his house for
the purpose of enjoying his strange
hobby of having them live there to
gether before they could be married.
Carl Strahm, Mary Cogswell,
Charles Letts, and Janice Swan
played the domestic staff in Mr. Lat
imer's house.
The comedy drew big crowds but
was not considered as well done as
some of the more recent plays this
year. The blame for this comment
the Daily reviewer thought went to
the "rather trite and inconsequen
tial story" rather than to the indi
vidual performances of the cast.
The first day of December saw
the opening of the Gaieties, spon
sored by Ram's Head. The hard
work of Peggy Fitts, director, and
the excellent show put on by Miss
Fitts, Jean Levinson, and Johnny
High kept the show from what
might have been a war-time slump.
Some of the most outstanding acts
were the Fitts-Levinson duo ,Doug
DuLac's magic show, Jackie Cannon
and Bob Gettys singing "Reminis
cing," and Johnny High's presenta
tion of a one-man opera.
Irish Comedy
A few days later, the Stanford
Players opened in another play—
this time "Is Life Worth Living?" a
comedy of Irish folk by Lennox
Robinson. Outstanding characters of
the play according to the Daily re
viewer was Hector de la Mare,
played by George Crane, who was
followed closely by Edmond Maher
as Eddie Twohig in distinction of
performance.
The other actors in the play —
Sally Stocker, Mary Higgins, Pa
tricia Neilson, Martin Nalder, Mary
Martin, Milton Valantine, Richard
Moorsteen, Murry Stirton, and Her
bert Rubin—did a good job in act
ing their parts, but the play itself
is not as good as some of those pre
sented in the past two quarters.
'Show Off'
"The Show Off," by George Kelly,
was the first play of winter quarter
and outstanding performances went
to Margaret Morgan as Amy and to
Johnny High as Aubrey Piper, the
.show off. The play alternated be
tween straight comedy and tragi
comedy, according to the Daily re
view. The play concerns a family
continually irritated by the antics of
the show off who is in love with the
Clara, the sister-in-law, and Mary
Higgins as Mrs. Fisher, the mother,
also gave outstanding performances
and helped to make this comedy the
great success it was.
'Little Foxes'
"In a slick, tightly timed first
night performance of Lillian Hell
man's sure-fire 'Little Foxes' last
night the women did it again. Bar
bara Welch as Birdie and Sally
Stocker as Regina walked cleanly
off with the first and third acts re
spectively to tie for top honors, as
Johnny High in the person of the
wily Ben paced a smooth, well-in
hand second"—so ran the opening of
the review on this play which
opened March 7.
Honorable mention went to How
ard Campbell for his handling of
Horace Giddens, to Charles Smurr
for his characterization of the weak
ling nephew, to Mary Cogswell as
Addie, and Mary Lou Patton for her
role as the 17-year-old daughter.
Wilde Play
"The Importance of Being Ear- !
nest, by Oscar Wilde, which opened
May 2, was also a great success.
Added attraction to this play was
its production in penthouse style on
the main stage of Memorial Audi
torium. All the actors were very
good, but if anyone stole the show
it was Murray Stirton as the en- !
gagingly outspoken spinster, Miss i
Prism, of Manor House.
Leading roles were portrayed by
Johnny High, Maggie Morgan. Wil
liam Melton, and Lorna Robertson.
Bai bara Welch played the very
proper Lady Bracknell, and other
parts were played by Martin Nalder
and Charles Smurr. This was the
best play of the year, according to
the Daily review.
Spring Show
Ram's Head Spring Show with its
main feature the melodrama, "From
Rags to Riches." All of the charac
ters were so outstanding that it was
impossible to pick out one as steal
ing the show. Some of the main
hiss-drawers were Johnny High,
Stewart Harrison, Willie Davies,
Murray Stirton, Janice Swan, and
Jane Saulsbury.
The olio acts went over very well,
all adding up to the wonderful job
Corky Wollman did in directing the
show.
'Merry Wives'
Otto Nicolai's comic opera, "The
Merry Wives of Windsor," which the
Stanford Players put on in conjunc
tion wilh the Division of Music.
Student leads were sung by Bruce
Stewart and Jack Taylor. Other
leads were sung by visiting urtists
who were excellent in their respec
tive roles.
The opera and chorus under the
dilution of Herbert Jan Popper of

the Department of Music each con
tained about 40 or 50 students giving
their all for the performance. The
opera was so good that it rated a
number of inches of praise in the
San Francisco Chronicle.

ling nephew, to Mary Cogswell as
Addie, and Mary Lou Patton for her
role as the 17-year-old daughter.
Wilde Play
"The Importance of Being Ear- !
nest, by Oscar Wilde, which opened
May 2, was also a great success.
Added attraction to this play was
its production in penthouse style on
the main stage of Memorial Audi
torium. All the actors were very
good, but if anyone stole the show
it was Murray Stirton as the en- !
gagingly outspoken spinster, Miss i
Prism, of Manor House.
Leading roles were portrayed by
Johnny High, Maggie Morgan. Wil
liam Melton, and Lorna Robertson.
Bai bara Welch played the very
proper Lady Bracknell, and other
parts were played by Martin Nalder
and Charles Smurr. This was the
best play of the year, according to
the Daily review.
Spring Show
Ram's Head Spring Show with its
main feature the melodrama, "From
Rags to Riches." All of the charac
ters were so outstanding that it was
impossible to pick out one as steal
ing the show. Some of the main
hiss-drawers were Johnny High,
Stewart Harrison, Willie Davies,
Murray Stirton, Janice Swan, and
Jane Saulsbury.
The olio acts went over very well,
all adding up to the wonderful job
Corky Wollman did in directing the
show.
'Merry Wives'
Otto Nicolai's comic opera, "The
Merry Wives of Windsor," which the
Stanford Players put on in conjunc
tion wilh the Division of Music.
Student leads were sung by Bruce
Stewart and Jack Taylor. Other
leads were sung by visiting urtists
who were excellent in their respec
tive roles.
The opera and chorus under the
dilution of Herbert Jan Popper of

the Department of Music each con
tained about 40 or 50 students giving
their all for the performance. The
opera was so good that it rated a
number of inches of praise in the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Five plays, an opera, a Gaieites Show, and a Spring Show have been
put on by the Department of Speech and Drama this year, and all add up
to what has been termed as "a very successful year."
The Stanford Players opened the year November 8 wilh an English
comedy by A. A. Milne, "The Dover Road." The lead <>l the eccentric Mr.

Latimer was played by Johnny 4
High.
Characters
Harvey Small, Newton Arnold,
Sally Stocker, and Hazel Spore were
the four young people who came
under Mr. Latimer's jurisdiction,
and he kept them in his house for
the purpose of enjoying his strange
hobby of having them live there to
gether before they could be married.
Carl Strahm, Mary Cogswell,
Charles Letts, and Janice Swan
played the domestic staff in Mr. Lat
imer's house.
The comedy drew big crowds but
was not considered as well done as
some of the more recent plays this
year. The blame for this comment
the Daily reviewer thought went to
the "rather trite and inconsequen
tial story" rather than to the indi
vidual performances of the cast.
The first day of December saw
the opening of the Gaieties, spon
sored by Ram's Head. The hard
work of Peggy Fitts, director, and
the excellent show put on by Miss
Fitts, Jean Levinson, and Johnny
High kept the show from what
might have been a war-time slump.
Some of the most outstanding acts
were the Fitts-Levinson duo ,Doug
DuLac's magic show, Jackie Cannon
and Bob Gettys singing "Reminis
cing," and Johnny High's presenta
tion of a one-man opera.
Irish Comedy
A few days later, the Stanford
Players opened in another play—
this time "Is Life Worth Living?" a
comedy of Irish folk by Lennox
Robinson. Outstanding characters of
the play according to the Daily re
viewer was Hector de la Mare,
played by George Crane, who was
followed closely by Edmond Maher
as Eddie Twohig in distinction of
performance.
The other actors in the play —
Sally Stocker, Mary Higgins, Pa
tricia Neilson, Martin Nalder, Mary
Martin, Milton Valantine, Richard
Moorsteen, Murry Stirton, and Her
bert Rubin—did a good job in act
ing their parts, but the play itself
is not as good as some of those pre
sented in the past two quarters.
'Show Off'
"The Show Off," by George Kelly,
was the first play of winter quarter
and outstanding performances went
to Margaret Morgan as Amy and to
Johnny High as Aubrey Piper, the
.show off. The play alternated be
tween straight comedy and tragi
comedy, according to the Daily re
view. The play concerns a family
continually irritated by the antics of
the show off who is in love with the
Clara, the sister-in-law, and Mary
Higgins as Mrs. Fisher, the mother,
also gave outstanding performances
and helped to make this comedy the
great success it was.
'Little Foxes'
"In a slick, tightly timed first
night performance of Lillian Hell
man's sure-fire 'Little Foxes' last
night the women did it again. Bar
bara Welch as Birdie and Sally
Stocker as Regina walked cleanly
off with the first and third acts re
spectively to tie for top honors, as
Johnny High in the person of the
wily Ben paced a smooth, well-in
hand second"—so ran the opening of
the review on this play which
opened March 7.
Honorable mention went to How

Horace Giddens, to Charles Smurr
for his characterization of the weak

A few days later, the Stanford
Players opened in another play—
this time "Is Life Worth Living?" a
comedy of Irish folk by Lennox
Robinson. Outstanding characters of
the play according to the Daily re
viewer was Hector de la Mare,
played by George Crane, who was
followed closely by Edmond Maher
as Eddie Twohig in distinction of
performance.
The other actors in the play —
Sally Stocker, Mary Higgins, Pa
tricia Neilson, Martin Nalder, Mary
Martin, Milton Valantine, Richard
Moorsteen, Murry Stirton, and Her
bert Rubin—did a good job in act
ing their parts, but the play itself
is not as good as some of those pre
sented in the past two quarters.
'Show Off'
"The Show Off," by George Kelly,
was the first play of winter quarter
and outstanding performances went
to Margaret Morgan as Amy and to
Johnny High as Aubrey Piper, the
.show off. The play alternated be
tween straight comedy and tragi
comedy, according to the Daily re
view. The play concerns a family
continually irritated by the antics of
the show off who is in love with the
Clara, the sister-in-law, and Mary
Higgins as Mrs. Fisher, the mother,
also gave outstanding performances
and helped to make this comedy the
great success it was.
'Little Foxes'
"In a slick, tightly timed first
night performance of Lillian Hell
man's sure-fire 'Little Foxes' last
night the women did it again. Bar
bara Welch as Birdie and Sally
Stocker as Regina walked cleanly
off with the first and third acts re
spectively to tie for top honors, as
Johnny High in the person of the
wily Ben paced a smooth, well-in
hand second"—so ran the opening of
the review on this play which
opened March 7.
Honorable mention went to How
ard Campbell for his handling of
Horace Giddens, to Charles Smurr
for his characterization of the weak
ling nephew, to Mary Cogswell as
Addie, and Mary Lou Patton for her
role as the 17-year-old daughter.
Wilde Play
"The Importance of Being Ear- !
nest, by Oscar Wilde, which opened
May 2, was also a great success.
Added attraction to this play was
its production in penthouse style on
the main stage of Memorial Audi
torium. All the actors were very
good, but if anyone stole the show
it was Murray Stirton as the en- !
gagingly outspoken spinster, Miss i
Prism, of Manor House.
Leading roles were portrayed by
Johnny High, Maggie Morgan. Wil
liam Melton, and Lorna Robertson.
Bai bara Welch played the very
proper Lady Bracknell, and other
parts were played by Martin Nalder
and Charles Smurr. This was the
best play of the year, according to
the Daily review.
Spring Show
Ram's Head Spring Show with its
main feature the melodrama, "From
Rags to Riches." All of the charac
ters were so outstanding that it was
impossible to pick out one as steal
ing the show. Some of the main
hiss-drawers were Johnny High,
Stewart Harrison, Willie Davies,
Murray Stirton, Janice Swan, and
Jane Saulsbury.
The olio acts went over very well,
all adding up to the wonderful job
Corky Wollman did in directing the
show.
'Merry Wives'
Otto Nicolai's comic opera, "The
Merry Wives of Windsor," which the
Stanford Players put on in conjunc
tion wilh the Division of Music.
Student leads were sung by Bruce
Stewart and Jack Taylor. Other
leads were sung by visiting urtists
who were excellent in their respec
tive roles.
The opera and chorus under the
dilution of Herbert Jan Popper of

the Department of Music each con
tained about 40 or 50 students giving
their all for the performance. The
opera was so good that it rated a
number of inches of praise in the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Five plays, an opera, a Gaieites Show, and a Spring Show have been
put on by the Department of Speech and Drama this year, and all add up
to what has been termed as "a very successful year."
The Stanford Players opened the year November 8 wilh an English
comedy by A. A. Milne, "The Dover Road." The lead <>l the eccentric Mr.

Latimer was played by Johnny 4
High.
Characters
Harvey Small, Newton Arnold,
Sally Stocker, and Hazel Spore were
the four young people who came
under Mr. Latimer's jurisdiction,
and he kept them in his house for
the purpose of enjoying his strange
hobby of having them live there to
gether before they could be married.
Carl Strahm, Mary Cogswell,
Charles Letts, and Janice Swan
played the domestic staff in Mr. Lat
imer's house.
The comedy drew big crowds but
was not considered as well done as
some of the more recent plays this
year. The blame for this comment
the Daily reviewer thought went to
the "rather trite and inconsequen
tial story" rather than to the indi
vidual performances of the cast.
The first day of December saw
the opening of the Gaieties, spon
sored by Ram's Head. The hard
work of Peggy Fitts, director, and
the excellent show put on by Miss
Fitts, Jean Levinson, and Johnny
High kept the show from what
might have been a war-time slump.
Some of the most outstanding acts
were the Fitts-Levinson duo ,Doug
DuLac's magic show, Jackie Cannon
and Bob Gettys singing "Reminis
cing," and Johnny High's presenta
tion of a one-man opera.
