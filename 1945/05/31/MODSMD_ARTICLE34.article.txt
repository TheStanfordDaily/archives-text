## 
### 
When the Chappies heard that
Volume 107 of the Daily was end
ing this Friday, they spent an hour
or two in deep consultation, decided
that Farm students would be badly
in need of reading material during |

the week preceding finals week;
consequently the last issue of the I
Chaparral will appear on Wednes
day to liven up a dead "dead week."
Starting with the cover, which
I features Esquire's Ksky and the Old

Boy in a four-color photograph,
Chappie follows through with the
Varga girl, the Stanford beauty, La
gunita style, and the series of Es
quire-inspired cartoons.
