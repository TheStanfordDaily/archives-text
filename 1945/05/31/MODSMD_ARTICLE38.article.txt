It seems to be a tradition on the
Daily, and for that matter on just
about everything in this world, that
a time comes when there is an end,
a final page of an edition, a rest. We
see that more and more and come
to recognize it in its various shapes.
| In econ it could be called the point
of diminishing returns; in Western
j Civ some professors call it the end
| of a cycle. But whatever it is called,
i whatever form it takes, the result
j is still the same; the old leave, the
j new take their places.
Our Hopes
For four quarters we have been
I pounding out stories on our type
writers, trying to build some inter
est in sports, hoping that once in a
| while our stories will be read,
! thanking the editor when they go
to print, thanking the night editor
when they appear the next day. Our
lot is uncertain; we are behind be
fore we start and can never catch
up. But we do not lose faith. To
the contrary, we take "increased
devotion" and try not to let a day
go by without putting in some re
minder of what we l'eel to be the
basic part ot the Stanford spirit.
That is what we really are after,
what we have tried so hard to do.
Whether we have accomplished
our aims is undeterminable; we
have tried our hardest and done our
best. We have been working with
a skeleton staff, three in all, and
none of us being able to devote our
full time to our task. But we have
put, in every article that we have
written, some of our hopes. We
have tried every trick in journal
ism to draw interest to our articles
in the hope that they would be
understood, and we still wonder if
it was not in vain.
These Women
We shall never forget the certain
girl who asked, just this week, if
there were any sports at Stanford,
il Stanford men were competing in
anything. Those are the things that
hurt so much, the things that we
tried our best to put over and the*
things that we failed to accomplish.
Those are things that we were try
ing to escape from as early as last
summer quarter. We had to start
from scratch, but with each quar
tet we felt that we were building

j up the spirit and the interest more
and more. We had intramural
games, games between the civilians
and the service teams, games be
tween a Stanford team going under
the name of the Palo Alto Inde-
I pendents and many of the top bas
i ketball teams in the Bay Area,
j games between another Palo Alto
, Independent team and some service
, baseball squads.
Those were our teams, but we
1 had individual athletes also, athletes
who spent their time in practice so
that they could represent what they
believed in. We had some of the
j best track staxs on the coast, men
who had entered meets unattached
| or for some outside club and who
I had beaten the best that the colleges
and services had to offer. We had
published their feats, or at least we
thought we did, so that all Stanford
students could be prouder than ever
j of their school and their own stu
dents. And the young girl still
asked us whether Stanford was do
ing anything in the way of sports.

The quarter is finally over, and a
new editor and new officers have
been elected and appointed. Tak
ing over the job as Sports Editor
(the position deserves capital let

ters) will bo Bob Slobe, who will
be assisted by Bob Gilkey; both of
these boys are fine writers and both
are filled with determination. Their
lot may lie better, what with the
Navy students coming to Stanford
and probably starting our school
back again on the road of intercol
legiate athletics, but their task will
be harder than ever.
Ye Olde Swan-Song
I wish them the best of luck. All
that is lelt for me to do is close the
sports staff room (it is still the best

one in the Daily shack), give the
key back to the editor (why I can't ;
give it to Bob is beyond me, but I
guess every organization needs a
little red tape), and slowly walk out
of the picture. With that done, !
Volume 107 is, as far as sports are

i concerned, but a member of the
J Daily files.

I that's UO.

Whether we have accomplished

put, in every article that we have
written, some of our hopes. We
have tried every trick in journal

it was not in vain.
These Women
We shall never forget the certain
girl who asked, just this week, if
there were any sports at Stanford,
il Stanford men were competing in
anything. Those are the things that
hurt so much, the things that we
tried our best to put over and the*
things that we failed to accomplish.
Those are things that we were try
ing to escape from as early as last
summer quarter. We had to start
from scratch, but with each quar
tet we felt that we were building

j up the spirit and the interest more
and more. We had intramural
games, games between the civilians
and the service teams, games be
tween a Stanford team going under
the name of the Palo Alto Inde-
I pendents and many of the top bas
i ketball teams in the Bay Area,
j games between another Palo Alto
, Independent team and some service
, baseball squads.
Those were our teams, but we
1 had individual athletes also, athletes
who spent their time in practice so
that they could represent what they
believed in. We had some of the
j best track staxs on the coast, men
who had entered meets unattached
| or for some outside club and who
I had beaten the best that the colleges
and services had to offer. We had
published their feats, or at least we
thought we did, so that all Stanford
students could be prouder than ever
j of their school and their own stu
dents. And the young girl still
asked us whether Stanford was do
ing anything in the way of sports.

The quarter is finally over, and a
new editor and new officers have
been elected and appointed. Tak
ing over the job as Sports Editor
(the position deserves capital let

ters) will bo Bob Slobe, who will
be assisted by Bob Gilkey; both of
these boys are fine writers and both
are filled with determination. Their
lot may lie better, what with the
Navy students coming to Stanford
and probably starting our school
back again on the road of intercol
legiate athletics, but their task will
be harder than ever.
Ye Olde Swan-Song
I wish them the best of luck. All
that is lelt for me to do is close the
sports staff room (it is still the best

one in the Daily shack), give the
key back to the editor (why I can't ;
give it to Bob is beyond me, but I
guess every organization needs a
little red tape), and slowly walk out
of the picture. With that done, !

I that's UO.
It seems to be a tradition on the

a final page of an edition, a rest. We
see that more and more and come
to recognize it in its various shapes.

have tried every trick in journal
ism to draw interest to our articles
in the hope that they would be
understood, and we still wonder if
it was not in vain.
These Women
We shall never forget the certain
girl who asked, just this week, if
there were any sports at Stanford,
il Stanford men were competing in
anything. Those are the things that
hurt so much, the things that we
tried our best to put over and the*
things that we failed to accomplish.
Those are things that we were try
ing to escape from as early as last
summer quarter. We had to start
from scratch, but with each quar
tet we felt that we were building

j up the spirit and the interest more
and more. We had intramural
games, games between the civilians
and the service teams, games be
tween a Stanford team going under
the name of the Palo Alto Inde-
I pendents and many of the top bas
i ketball teams in the Bay Area,
j games between another Palo Alto
, Independent team and some service
, baseball squads.
Those were our teams, but we
1 had individual athletes also, athletes
who spent their time in practice so
that they could represent what they
believed in. We had some of the
j best track staxs on the coast, men
who had entered meets unattached
| or for some outside club and who
I had beaten the best that the colleges
and services had to offer. We had
published their feats, or at least we
thought we did, so that all Stanford
students could be prouder than ever
j of their school and their own stu
dents. And the young girl still
asked us whether Stanford was do
ing anything in the way of sports.

The quarter is finally over, and a
new editor and new officers have
been elected and appointed. Tak
ing over the job as Sports Editor
(the position deserves capital let

ters) will bo Bob Slobe, who will
be assisted by Bob Gilkey; both of
these boys are fine writers and both
are filled with determination. Their
lot may lie better, what with the
Navy students coming to Stanford
and probably starting our school
back again on the road of intercol
legiate athletics, but their task will
be harder than ever.
Ye Olde Swan-Song
I wish them the best of luck. All
that is lelt for me to do is close the
sports staff room (it is still the best

one in the Daily shack), give the
key back to the editor (why I can't ;
give it to Bob is beyond me, but I
guess every organization needs a
little red tape), and slowly walk out
of the picture. With that done, !
Volume 107 is, as far as sports are

i concerned, but a member of the
J Daily files.
As the old journalism book states,
I that's UO.
