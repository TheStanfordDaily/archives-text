### MARY LOU MUELLER 
The Sixth and Seventh War Loan
Drives, the United National Clothing
Collection, salvage drives and Bel
gian and Netherlands Relief arc
only some of the nation-wide, war
time efforts for which War Board,
under its co-ordinator, Jeaniiette
(iriinsley, has successfully secured
(lie co-operation of the entire Farm.
The Sixth War Loan Drive
l eached a figure $20,450 in excess of
the $27,000 goal which had been set
for Stanford. The results of the re
cent Seventh War Loan are not as
yet completely tabulated. The UN
CC aim of one garment from each
student netted a tonnage of cloth
ing in excess of anticipation, and
Netherlands Relief sent an open let
ter of thanks for Stanford's response
to its appeal.
In February, War Board, with
the approval of Fxcom, abolished
the system of two hours per week
war work pledges and placed the
program on a completely volun
teer basis. This eliminated the
system of counting and classify
ing war work which had prevailed
ii(i to that time.
War Board, explained Miss Grim
sloy, is not a separate activity or
committee, but a group co-ordinat
ing various student participation in
war work. "It is only as important
as each student makes it so by his
cooperation and realization of our
our aims," she said.
Regular activities of War Board,
carried on by committees and
<on continued throughout the
year, are: living group stamp sales
under chairman Millie Edwards;
Blood Bank donation under Cool
ColTin; salvage collection under
Shirley Jamison: Red Cross ac
tivities under Barbara Bonner;
knitting both for the Red Cross
and for Belgian Relief, under I'am
Meyer.
Also serving under War Board is
social co-ordinator Lucy Vance,
through whom campus functions
with USO. Dibble, Del Monte and
other hospitals and camps are ar
ranged.
Under the chairmanship of Bar
bara Beardslec, Stanford girls have
served Saturday luncheon at Allied
Arts.
Other activities which War
Board has taken under its wing
during the last year include USO
scraphooks. the making of Red
Cross afghans, cooperation with
the I'alo Alto Red Cross in the
courses it has given in First Aid
and Motor Corps, sign-ups for
stevedore and crop crews, and co

operation in other seasonal or oc
casional calls for participation.
Taking over Miss Grimsley's posi
ne.xt year will be Shirley Jamison,
present chairman of the Salvage
Committee.
