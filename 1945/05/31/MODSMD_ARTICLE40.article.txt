# Yarn Needed By Red Cross
## 
### 
Afghans arc needed more urgently
than ever by the Red Cross for dis
tribution to Army, Navy, and Vet
erans' hospitals, to troop transports
and hospital ships.
The Red Cross itself does not have
the yarn with which to supply the
knitter, and yarn stocks of most
stores are close to depletion.
Therefore, anyone with wool is
asked to bring it in to the Red Cross
house or the War Board office in
order that others may use it.
Hod Cross asks that the afghans
be bright and gay and be turned in
as soon as completed in order that
distribution may be speeded up ;is
much as possible. The finished ar
ticle should measure 48 by 72 inches
and be composed of unit squares six
by six inches. Four ply wools and
number 5 needles should be used.
The knitted squares may be joined
bv overcasting or by crocheting.
Groups or individuals may do an
entire afghan or may turn in the
squares to be assembled by the
Red Cross knitting department.
