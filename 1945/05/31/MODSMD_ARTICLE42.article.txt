# Skiers to See Films Tonight
## 
### 
Two ski films in technicolor will
be shown tonight at a Ski Club
meeting which will be held at 7:15 in
the Nitery, according to Breezy Ros
enthal. secretary of the club.
The regular Stanford ski emblems
which have not been available for a
long time, will be sold at the meet
ting. "This will be a good chance
for seniors who are grad"ating to
them before they leave school,"
Miss Rosenthal said.
The meeting will be short and will
open with a short review of this
year's business. This year's officers
will give a report, and any sug
gestions that Ski Club members m |y
have for improving the club will be
especially appreciated.
Ski Club members are planning
to get started early next year with
many more events on their calendar
than they have had this year.
