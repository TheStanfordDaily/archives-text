# Junior Prom Brings Bay to Stanford Farm
## Excom Politics Based On Student Awareness 
### BARBARA WHITE A.S.S.U. President 
Willi the last Executive Commit
tee of the year next week, the gavel
is to be turned over to Bob Kennedy
and the new Excom to carry on
what has been started and to build
and add to the ever-growing struc
ture of student government.
For the past year, Excom has
based its actions and policies on the
idea of securing an increasing
awareness among the students of
their government. Besides the
"busy work" and red tape that must
be waded through, we faced three
issues which we believed would
keep alive or revive that interest.
First, the election system could
be improved. The period for elec
tions was extended, the nomina
tion svstem was reviewed, and
with the student body behind it,
the total vote cast was propor
tionally equal to, or more than
any election returns since 1935.
Second, in struggling to reach stu
dent opinion on certain legislative
Excom started at home and
found that perhaps its own make-up
and machinery was at fault. Thus,
the area plan of representation was
inaugurated which, as it operates
next year, may be a progressive
step toward realizing our goal.
Third, Excom found itself work
ing with an obsolete constitution,
out-of-date bylaws, and charters no
longer workable, but with practi
cally unlimited powers granted to it
since 1042. It seemed an appropri
ate time to revamp the old constitu
tion and bring it into step with the
times.
So to the new Excom we turn
over a new constitution which will
be followed next year. There was
not time to put it to a student vote .
It is to be adopted, however, as a
by-law, thus making it reason
ably flexible so that necessary
changes may be made until it is
found that it is ready to be ofli
cially adopted by a student vote.
"Over the top" has been the
watchword and the result of the
drives this year despite decreased
enrollment, proving with the en
thuiasm crcated, that Stanford
students are not looking down from
an Ivory Tower, and arc certainly
not apathetic.

To Dr. Trcsid
dcr and those of
the Administra
tion, Excom de
sires to extend
sinccrc thanks
for their help
and advice,
working with
them next year,
the new Excom
can't lose.
To Dr. Mitch
ell, retiring Reg
istrar, the entire
student body re-

gretfully says goodbye and good
luck. We'll miss you.
To the incoming Excomâ€”you've
got Stevie and Miss Atcn, and an
enthusiastic and willing student
body confident in you. Go ahead
and good luck.


BARBARA WHITE, A.S.S.U
President.
