The following lyric tribute has
been written by Doris Butler:
Get your dates and bids, and press
Your formals and your lux
For thai sophisticated |> a llâ€”
A Junior Prom de luxe.
Skylight shadowy, subtle, soft
Will shine on shoreline sights
Krflecting City bridges, wharves,
Where we've spent other nights.
To learn all the special effects
crcated, the campus is advised by
the committee to buy bids now at
the A.S.S.U. office.
Ann Robinson is general chairman
of the affair with Shirley Pcttit,
Barbara Beardslec, Betty Por
ter, K. J. Suppiu, and Jean Richards
assisting. Anyone interested in dec
