### 
DEAR HELEN-
This is it. For Hodge and me and Volume
107, this is "thirty."
We leave you and Skid the tradition of the
Daily that has come through war. We were
the last to see the era of five big papers a week,
now there are three; we were the last to see
an editorial board of men; now they are gone.
Wo do without the teletype, we have to beg
for materials. Yes, we leave you all this, and
yet wo do it without a qualm.
We don't think it's the teletype, the size of
the paper, the sex of the staff, or football stories
that make the things we value about this Daily.
It's the sixty people who are the Daily, the ones
who come over every day and check up on
two or three inches that may be available for
them; the ones who give up a full day every
week to read long sheets of proof, get con
founded by obscure head counts, chase apa
thetic committee heads along with the good
ones, rude professors along with the coopera
tive ones, and forever are willing to be behind
in their studies, miss movies, and take time
from their friends, to help the Daily maintain
its quality of service to over three thousand
people of Stanford University.
We place an obligation on all of these people
greater than any other organization at Stanford.
We work every day, everyone sees our errors,
they don't remember the things we get right,
and the reward ... it seems to me, that it's this
staff. They have to believe in each other and
have respect for each other's work; the reward's
to see a day's work spread out before us in
our Eight o'clocks . . . Everybody at Stanford
reads the Daily ... or some of it . . . The glow
in seeing the morning's product (the Peninsula's
only one) is what counts. Remember you're
as good as the degree to which the lowliest
reporter is willing to work under you . . . that's
the measure to the staff.
To the campus as a whole, you'll find you're
taken pretty much for granted. But there is
a great place for the Daily. The place of the
Daily is to preserve at all costs the integrity
of our right to report all things as we see them.
You will find yourself more sympathetic to
some people and groups than to others. You
will find that sometimes you must forsake the
ones you like best because you disagree with
them. Don't be afraid to do this. The Daily's
arguments can stand on their own two feet
while you're editor, I know that. See who's
not getting his voice into the argument; you're
the only one who can help them. Don't pass
up an oversight or v/hat you think is an error
bccause the world is easier to live with in the
status quo; your job is to be alert with what is
wrong with the status quo. There's a role for the
Daily on this campus that cannot be filled any
other way; I value it, preserve it.
We have fought for the right to comment
about world affairs. In college, we are granted
a detachment from the pressure of earning a
living, and making day to day decisions, in the
hope that we will gain a broader wisdom that
will ultimately bring more to the world and to
ourselves. There is a tendency in college to
take privilege and think little about the respon
sibilities. We do not know much, but we should
strive to bring subjects of more than local con
corn before our readers.
Our position is privileged and it has long
been able to look from a liberal point of view,
to defend the rights of decency that too often
cife obscured because the world, unlike us, is
grim about the business of existence. Use our
favored position with responsibility and under
standing.
It is customary to thank people individually

in this last edit, but that's impossible here be
cause there are too many individuals in this
staff, to whom any expression would be an
understatement.
There is one person, however, who I must
at least try to say a little for the record, be
cause she has done more than can be expected
of any person. When Nancy Tilden, that's
"Tillie" hereinafter, finished her work as Man
aging Editor of Volume 106, she looked around
and without question, saw what had to be done.
The most formidable thing was a dull headache
in the business office known as Office Man
ager, without which our long dreams of more
big papers would fail.
Tillie has been in that position for two quar
ters, tirelessly, when tired, and determinedly
when most lacking inspiration, plugging at
papers for us, and writing our difficult reviews
and edits. There is no recognition or thanks
we can give, except to say we know that no
one has done so much for, yea, the Daily.
For the rest, I think you know most of it.
My own feeling is that the Daily as we know
it, is taking a sound step in moving on to
Volume 108 with you and Skid.
When it's "thirty," it's so long—to you people
I'll never forget.
—BERN.

staff. They have to believe in each other and
have respect for each other's work; the reward's
to see a day's work spread out before us in
our Eight o'clocks . . . Everybody at Stanford
reads the Daily ... or some of it . . . The glow
in seeing the morning's product (the Peninsula's
only one) is what counts. Remember you're
as good as the degree to which the lowliest
reporter is willing to work under you . . . that's
the measure to the staff.
To the campus as a whole, you'll find you're
taken pretty much for granted. But there is
a great place for the Daily. The place of the
Daily is to preserve at all costs the integrity
of our right to report all things as we see them.
You will find yourself more sympathetic to
some people and groups than to others. You
will find that sometimes you must forsake the
ones you like best because you disagree with
them. Don't be afraid to do this. The Daily's
arguments can stand on their own two feet
while you're editor, I know that. See who's
not getting his voice into the argument; you're
the only one who can help them. Don't pass
up an oversight or v/hat you think is an error
bccause the world is easier to live with in the
status quo; your job is to be alert with what is
wrong with the status quo. There's a role for the
Daily on this campus that cannot be filled any
other way; I value it, preserve it.
We have fought for the right to comment
about world affairs. In college, we are granted
a detachment from the pressure of earning a
living, and making day to day decisions, in the
hope that we will gain a broader wisdom that
will ultimately bring more to the world and to
ourselves. There is a tendency in college to
take privilege and think little about the respon
sibilities. We do not know much, but we should
strive to bring subjects of more than local con
corn before our readers.
Our position is privileged and it has long
been able to look from a liberal point of view,
to defend the rights of decency that too often
cife obscured because the world, unlike us, is
grim about the business of existence. Use our
favored position with responsibility and under
standing.
It is customary to thank people individually

in this last edit, but that's impossible here be
cause there are too many individuals in this
staff, to whom any expression would be an
understatement.
There is one person, however, who I must
at least try to say a little for the record, be
cause she has done more than can be expected
of any person. When Nancy Tilden, that's
"Tillie" hereinafter, finished her work as Man
aging Editor of Volume 106, she looked around
and without question, saw what had to be done.
The most formidable thing was a dull headache
in the business office known as Office Man
ager, without which our long dreams of more
big papers would fail.
Tillie has been in that position for two quar
ters, tirelessly, when tired, and determinedly
when most lacking inspiration, plugging at
papers for us, and writing our difficult reviews
and edits. There is no recognition or thanks
we can give, except to say we know that no
one has done so much for, yea, the Daily.
For the rest, I think you know most of it.
My own feeling is that the Daily as we know
it, is taking a sound step in moving on to
Volume 108 with you and Skid.
When it's "thirty," it's so long—to you people
I'll never forget.

DEAR HELEN-
This is it. For Hodge and me and Volume
107, this is "thirty."
We leave you and Skid the tradition of the
Daily that has come through war. We were
the last to see the era of five big papers a week,
now there are three; we were the last to see
an editorial board of men; now they are gone.
Wo do without the teletype, we have to beg
for materials. Yes, we leave you all this, and
yet wo do it without a qualm.
We don't think it's the teletype, the size of
the paper, the sex of the staff, or football stories
that make the things we value about this Daily.
It's the sixty people who are the Daily, the ones
who come over every day and check up on
two or three inches that may be available for
them; the ones who give up a full day every
week to read long sheets of proof, get con
founded by obscure head counts, chase apa
thetic committee heads along with the good
ones, rude professors along with the coopera
tive ones, and forever are willing to be behind
in their studies, miss movies, and take time
from their friends, to help the Daily maintain
its quality of service to over three thousand
people of Stanford University.
We place an obligation on all of these people
greater than any other organization at Stanford.
We work every day, everyone sees our errors,
they don't remember the things we get right,
and the reward ... it seems to me, that it's this
staff. They have to believe in each other and
have respect for each other's work; the reward's
to see a day's work spread out before us in

Daily on this campus that cannot be filled any
other way; I value it, preserve it.
We have fought for the right to comment
about world affairs. In college, we are granted
a detachment from the pressure of earning a
living, and making day to day decisions, in the
hope that we will gain a broader wisdom that
will ultimately bring more to the world and to
ourselves. There is a tendency in college to
take privilege and think little about the respon
sibilities. We do not know much, but we should
strive to bring subjects of more than local con
corn before our readers.
Our position is privileged and it has long
been able to look from a liberal point of view,
to defend the rights of decency that too often
cife obscured because the world, unlike us, is
grim about the business of existence. Use our
favored position with responsibility and under
standing.
It is customary to thank people individually

in this last edit, but that's impossible here be
cause there are too many individuals in this
staff, to whom any expression would be an
understatement.
There is one person, however, who I must
at least try to say a little for the record, be
cause she has done more than can be expected
of any person. When Nancy Tilden, that's
"Tillie" hereinafter, finished her work as Man
aging Editor of Volume 106, she looked around
and without question, saw what had to be done.
The most formidable thing was a dull headache
in the business office known as Office Man
ager, without which our long dreams of more
big papers would fail.
Tillie has been in that position for two quar
ters, tirelessly, when tired, and determinedly
when most lacking inspiration, plugging at
papers for us, and writing our difficult reviews
and edits. There is no recognition or thanks
we can give, except to say we know that no
one has done so much for, yea, the Daily.
For the rest, I think you know most of it.
My own feeling is that the Daily as we know
it, is taking a sound step in moving on to
Volume 108 with you and Skid.
When it's "thirty," it's so long—to you people
I'll never forget.

DEAR HELEN-
This is it. For Hodge and me and Volume
107, this is "thirty."
We leave you and Skid the tradition of the
Daily that has come through war. We were
the last to see the era of five big papers a week,
now there are three; we were the last to see
an editorial board of men; now they are gone.
Wo do without the teletype, we have to beg
for materials. Yes, we leave you all this, and
yet wo do it without a qualm.
We don't think it's the teletype, the size of
the paper, the sex of the staff, or football stories
that make the things we value about this Daily.
It's the sixty people who are the Daily, the ones
who come over every day and check up on
two or three inches that may be available for
them; the ones who give up a full day every
week to read long sheets of proof, get con
founded by obscure head counts, chase apa
thetic committee heads along with the good
ones, rude professors along with the coopera
tive ones, and forever are willing to be behind
in their studies, miss movies, and take time
from their friends, to help the Daily maintain
its quality of service to over three thousand
people of Stanford University.
We place an obligation on all of these people
greater than any other organization at Stanford.
We work every day, everyone sees our errors,
they don't remember the things we get right,
and the reward ... it seems to me, that it's this
staff. They have to believe in each other and
have respect for each other's work; the reward's
to see a day's work spread out before us in
our Eight o'clocks . . . Everybody at Stanford
reads the Daily ... or some of it . . . The glow
in seeing the morning's product (the Peninsula's
only one) is what counts. Remember you're
as good as the degree to which the lowliest
reporter is willing to work under you . . . that's
the measure to the staff.
To the campus as a whole, you'll find you're
taken pretty much for granted. But there is
a great place for the Daily. The place of the
Daily is to preserve at all costs the integrity
of our right to report all things as we see them.
You will find yourself more sympathetic to
some people and groups than to others. You
will find that sometimes you must forsake the
ones you like best because you disagree with
them. Don't be afraid to do this. The Daily's
arguments can stand on their own two feet
while you're editor, I know that. See who's
not getting his voice into the argument; you're
the only one who can help them. Don't pass
up an oversight or v/hat you think is an error
bccause the world is easier to live with in the
status quo; your job is to be alert with what is
wrong with the status quo. There's a role for the
Daily on this campus that cannot be filled any
