### PEGGY FITTS 
Well, this is the last of these, and not the
easiest by any means. There seems to be a
good deal to say by way of kissing off the
parting quarter, and a fine quarter it was—up to
next Monday—what with all the traditional at
tractions, except sun, and a few extras, except
sun.
More than the usual allotment of history, en
tertainment, and serious thinking has passed
between these low green walls, and filled
Volume 107 with a number of large-size head
lines that more people than us are going to
remember.
But those of us who will be walking the Quad
two weeks from Sunday for the last time as
Stanford undergraduates are going to remem
ber the things that nobody has to write a head
line for, the things that belong to Stanford alone.
Except in case of earthquake or bankruptcy
these things don't change; they have grown into
us and are, by this time, as much ourselves as
the homes we are going back to. There is no
way to talk about them that will make them
any more real and valuable than they are; taken
together, they add up to our life here, a life that
is full and good and growing, and one that we
couldn't have had anywhere else in the world.
That is really all I ever wanted to say in this
column.
As we say in the newspaper business, 30.
