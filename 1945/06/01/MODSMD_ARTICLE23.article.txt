### Elliot Epsteen 
The Near Eastern crisis has taken a turn. II is hard
to say whether for the better or worse, hut it has
turned, and it will probably continue to spiral along
a confused course for quite a while.
The picture becomes more complicated and, to a
certain extent, more ominous, because of two recent
developments. The first was the order of the British
government directing their C-in-C in the Middle
East to intervene in the crisis if necessary. The sec
ond was the statement Irom Paris (hat France would
"stand firm." This statement also announced (hat
a clash between British and French troops might
develop.
America has also (ossed in her note, and its con
tents place us in support of Britain, but we do not go
as far as Whitehall.
REACTIONS
The French government is said to be reading by
parts. The official reaction, described above, is ru
mored to run counter to the ideas of Foreign Minis
ter Georges Bidault. If this information is true, then
an important split in the present French political set
up might develop. However, it is all rumor so far.
The reaction in San Francisco is not too great.
The trusteeship committee, which would discuss this
problem if anybody would, held a press conference
today at noon. The chairman gave out the usual
information as to what phrase might just possibly
be inserted in clause X, and. at the very end, re
marked that his committee was not, as he said cer
tain members of the press were inferring, an arena
for peoples with grievances and those against whom
the grievances are directed. His committee, he
claimed, was simply interested in machinery. In
other words, he denied its interest in the crisis.
CONCLUSIONS
On the surface, it might seem thai a great deal of
trouble is brewing. However, there is a submerged
literary ray of sunshine that appeared two days ago in
"France Journal," a French propaganda publication
for the benefit of the UNCIO press. The article to
which I am referring carried a statement by General
Paul-Etienne Beynet, French Delegate-General in the
Near East. The French delegation has confirmed it
as their present stand.
lie claimed that the whole thing was a big mis
take, that the movements of Senegalese and new
French forces into the two countries were "routine,"
and that the only cause of any dispute is a Syrian-
Lebanese misunderstanding of the French requests,
which do not intend to infringe upon "Syrian and
I.ehanesc sovereignty."
Of course, the statement is ridiculous, since street
fighting is hardly the course of normal troop move
ments. But it might show that the French are pre
paring to withdraw with "good face," and General
De Gaulle's strong statement might be a part of the
preparation. At any rate, his delegation here prom
ised to hold a press conference in the near future, and
its results should be interesting.

literary ray of sunshine that appeared two days ago in
"France Journal," a French propaganda publication
for the benefit of the UNCIO press. The article to
which I am referring carried a statement by General
Paul-Etienne Beynet, French Delegate-General in the
Near East. The French delegation has confirmed it
as their present stand.
lie claimed that the whole thing was a big mis
take, that the movements of Senegalese and new
French forces into the two countries were "routine,"
and that the only cause of any dispute is a Syrian-
Lebanese misunderstanding of the French requests,
which do not intend to infringe upon "Syrian and
I.ehanesc sovereignty."
Of course, the statement is ridiculous, since street
fighting is hardly the course of normal troop move
ments. But it might show that the French are pre
paring to withdraw with "good face," and General
De Gaulle's strong statement might be a part of the
preparation. At any rate, his delegation here prom
ised to hold a press conference in the near future, and
its results should be interesting.
The Near Eastern crisis has taken a turn. II is hard
to say whether for the better or worse, hut it has
turned, and it will probably continue to spiral along
a confused course for quite a while.
The picture becomes more complicated and, to a
certain extent, more ominous, because of two recent
developments. The first was the order of the British
government directing their C-in-C in the Middle
East to intervene in the crisis if necessary. The sec
ond was the statement Irom Paris (hat France would
"stand firm." This statement also announced (hat
a clash between British and French troops might
develop.
America has also (ossed in her note, and its con
tents place us in support of Britain, but we do not go
as far as Whitehall.
REACTIONS
The French government is said to be reading by
parts. The official reaction, described above, is ru
mored to run counter to the ideas of Foreign Minis
ter Georges Bidault. If this information is true, then
an important split in the present French political set
up might develop. However, it is all rumor so far.
The reaction in San Francisco is not too great.
The trusteeship committee, which would discuss this
problem if anybody would, held a press conference
today at noon. The chairman gave out the usual
information as to what phrase might just possibly
be inserted in clause X, and. at the very end, re
marked that his committee was not, as he said cer
tain members of the press were inferring, an arena
for peoples with grievances and those against whom
the grievances are directed. His committee, he
claimed, was simply interested in machinery. In
other words, he denied its interest in the crisis.
CONCLUSIONS
On the surface, it might seem thai a great deal of
trouble is brewing. However, there is a submerged
literary ray of sunshine that appeared two days ago in
"France Journal," a French propaganda publication
for the benefit of the UNCIO press. The article to
which I am referring carried a statement by General
