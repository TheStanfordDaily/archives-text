# Philippines Missing 'Life' Since Beginning of War
## 
### 
"Philippine readers have had no Life' or 'Time' since Pearl Harbor,"
according to a letter from Manila written by Dalmacio Martin, former
Stanford graduate .student in the School of Education.
The letter asks whether it is possible to buy complete sets of "Life"
and "Time" since Pearl Harbor. Mrs. Sterling, at the Bookstore, explained
that she had wired to the publishers, â™¦

but received a negative answer. She
would like to ask all students to
bring in their old copies of the two
magazines. "I believe we can as
semble fairly complete sets thai
way," she said.
According to Mis. Sterling, the
shortage of magazines arid books in
the Philippines is far more serious
than we realize. Classes of fifty
students have been lucky to have
one book, a pad of paper and a pen
cil between. Teachers are working
on double shifts, instructing one
group of children during the morn
ing and another in the afternoon.
Mr. Martin, who is working'lor
the Philippine Bureau of Education,
wrote the letter during the battle for
Manila. "As I write this," it says,
"mortar and cannon shells come
Hying overhead from the American
positions in Manila to the districts
in which the Japs have barricade tl
themselves. The game is up for the
sons of the kingdom of heaven."
