# Daily Headlines Tell a Story----
## V-E Tension, Nation's Loss, Navy for Farm 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
When rumors about V-E Day be
ing just a matter or days or hours
away began to circulate last month,
the Daily staff began to plan a paper
on which the front page would be
little else than headlines. Specula
tions came closer, and finally Asso
ciated Press came through with the
news that Germany had surren
dered.
It was a rather beaten-looking
staff that sat in the Shack a couple
of days before the actual V-E Day,
ruading enormous surrender heads
in all of the City papers —and even
the Paly Times. But still the little
United Press bell in the Shack didn't
ring to say that the war in Europe
was over.
We Break Down
Whyn news came that President
Truman was going to make a vital
speech the morning of May 8, at just
about the time the Daily would be
thrown on Quad with nothing more
startling than a Women's Confer
ence story—even the Daily conserv
atism broke. That was the morning
there was a two-inch front page
banner, saying, "Japs Next!"— Vo
lume 107's fattest headline.
The one other time during the
history of the volume when the
night editor would have been justi
fied in splashing the front page with
big black letters was at President
Roosevelt's death. This time the
trouble didn't lie in uneonfirmation,
but in the fact that the news came
in the afternoon. By the time the

I Daily came out, everyone down to
! the last frog in the bio labs knew
I about it.
Farewell to a Leader
Instead of coming out the next
morning with a page full of heads,
dead in their sensationalism, the
upper part of the sheet was lined
! with black, and the section was
headed, "Franklin D. Roosevelt —
1882-1945."
Probably he volume's local head
line, though, was the banner in the
May 2 Daily. It was the "Anchors
Aweigh Navy for Stanford'' head,
announcing that a Naval R.O.T.C.
! unit had been assigned to Stanford —
and this time the Daily had exclu
| sive announcing rights.
The impact of this head alone was
wnough to make Toyon sigh, Roble
shout, and the Paly Times curse.
Something like this comes only once
a volume, but is worth two whole
quarters of trying to make ten
words lit into an eleven count.

Probably he volume's local head
line, though, was the banner in the
May 2 Daily. It was the "Anchors
Aweigh Navy for Stanford'' head,
announcing that a Naval R.O.T.C.

and this time the Daily had exclu

The impact of this head alone was
wnough to make Toyon sigh, Roble
shout, and the Paly Times curse.
Something like this comes only once
a volume, but is worth two whole
quarters of trying to make ten
words lit into an eleven count.

When rumors about V-E Day be
ing just a matter or days or hours
away began to circulate last month,
the Daily staff began to plan a paper
on which the front page would be
little else than headlines. Specula
tions came closer, and finally Asso
ciated Press came through with the
news that Germany had surren
dered.
It was a rather beaten-looking
staff that sat in the Shack a couple
of days before the actual V-E Day,
ruading enormous surrender heads
in all of the City papers —and even
the Paly Times. But still the little
United Press bell in the Shack didn't
ring to say that the war in Europe
was over.
We Break Down
Whyn news came that President
Truman was going to make a vital
speech the morning of May 8, at just
about the time the Daily would be
thrown on Quad with nothing more
startling than a Women's Confer
ence story—even the Daily conserv
atism broke. That was the morning
there was a two-inch front page
banner, saying, "Japs Next!"— Vo
lume 107's fattest headline.
The one other time during the
history of the volume when the
night editor would have been justi
fied in splashing the front page with
big black letters was at President
Roosevelt's death. This time the
trouble didn't lie in uneonfirmation,
but in the fact that the news came
in the afternoon. By the time the

I Daily came out, everyone down to
! the last frog in the bio labs knew
I about it.
Farewell to a Leader
Instead of coming out the next
morning with a page full of heads,
dead in their sensationalism, the
upper part of the sheet was lined
! with black, and the section was
headed, "Franklin D. Roosevelt —
1882-1945."
