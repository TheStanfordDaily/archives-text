# Press Publishes More 'Who's Who'
## 
### 
Part Two of the third edition of
"Who's Who in Latin America," un
der the editorship of Ronald Hilton,
professor of Romanic languages, has
just been published by the Stan
ford University Press, according to
Stanley M. Croonquist, sales man
ager.
This part covers Central America
and Panama. Its appearance marks
the beginning of a greatly expanded
new edition to be published jointly
by the A. N. Marquis Company,
publishers of "Who's Who in Amer
ica,"and the Stanford University
Press, Mr. Croonquist said.
When completed it will contain
some 8,000 biographies of the out
standing people of all of Latin
America, about five times as many
as were included in the second edi
tion which was published under the
editorship of Professor Peixy A.
Martin.
"The many difficulties of collect
ing the additional material have
| made it expedient to issue this third
edition in seven parts, to be pub
lished as the necessary biographies
arc received," Mr. Croonquist said.
Part One, Mexico, will be ready
in the summer.
