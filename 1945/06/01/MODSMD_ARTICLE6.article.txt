# Fearless Discussion Aim Of Stanford, Tresidder
## 
### 
Editorial Note: This is the final in our series of articles on
Stanford's present and postwar outlook.
We asked Dr. Tresidder to comment on Stanford's future;
and he responded with the following quotation:
"And when 1 shall hear it proclaimed that education is
the main function oi Stanford—the making of good men and
women and of good citizens for the republic—; when I sec the
ideal held in as much esteem as the practical, the humanities
honored egually with science; when I see the different
branches of learning v/orking in harmony for the good of all,
the members of one grand organic whole; when I hear on
the campus a frank and fearless discussion of University
problems leading up to an intelligent public opinion, then I
shall believe that Stanford is nearing the eminent position
she is entitled to and is ready to march forth to her manifest
destiny."
This statement was written by Trustee Horace Davis in 1907.
Dr. Tresidder believes that it well expresses our present day
hopes for Stanford's future.
