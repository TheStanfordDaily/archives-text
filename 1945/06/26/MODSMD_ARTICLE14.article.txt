Welcome, Frosli
Into a sun-drenched, lazy Stanford, some 200
freshmen move today, and we want to extend
them a welcome for all of us here today and for
all who won't meet them until the fall.
In many ways you will meet a curtailed scho
lastic and social program for the summer, and
in another, you will find that summer at Stanford
presents a unique acquaintance with the Univer
sity where you can gain a more leisurely appre
ciation of its workings and its surroundings.
The warm half-Mission, half-Moorish architec
ture is more suited to the Farm's hazy summers
than perhaps any other time, and the lazy tempo
of the summer days can be a valued introduction
to this school.
Summer can also provide you with your first
introduction to the Daily. As a semi-weekly in
tabloid form, the Stanford Daily will continue to
serve the community and soon will announce a
tryout program for those who would like to gain
experience for the fall and initiation into the tra
dition and fun associated with the Peninsula's
Only Morning Newspaper.
