### DICK BOWER 
â€”And Say 'Hello'
I wonder what summer quarter 1945 holds in store
for us. Some people tell me that it will be of the pre
war variety in which the enrollment consisted of
moth-eaten high school teachers and failing students
taking 15 units of Hygiene. And they made room for
those of the James Gordon Shinbunny, Jr., type who
look toward bond rallies, bridge tourneys, and nights
in the Peninsula Creamery.
As for myself, I'm gunning for a summer of the
work hard, play hard species. Lots of evenings at
Hank Mora's sipping long, cool ones and plenty of
afternoons at Enrico Rossotti's downing short, stubbie
ones. Of course there should also be a day or two
over at Half Moon Bay or Santa Cruz, with perhaps
a side trip to L.A. for good behavior. But we musn't
forget that there is such a thing as an eight o'clock
class and such an institution as the library (the latter
is not to be used for footsie games, Mary Al.)
This ideal equilibrium will be hard to maintain,
however, if I run into any more girls like Mildred.
My first glimpse of Mildred found her studying a
Cellar menu as if it were a Daily Racing Form. Her
misty, close-set eyes, I soon learned, have little room
in between for thinking. And her hair, the color a
peach milk shake should be, looked dangerous.
"Milli,e," as the boys in the back room now call her,
comes from Stockton and wants to be one of those
girls in the night clubs who snaps a picture of your
party for $2 a shot. Really though, she's not vulgar.
It's just that Millie, like the Monroe "Mole" has been
around Stockton too long.
All through lunch Milli" kept hoping that there
would be plenty of "nice parties" around this summer
so she could practice up on her candid-cameraing.
Personally. I think that she's playing the old "badger"
game of catching couples in compromising situations
and then putting on the "bite" to destroy the pictorial
evidence.
Since then I've been feeling sorry for Millie. Why?
Because I know that she'll get herself into a jam and
be asked to leave Stanford. And she'll cry and curse
and that will be the end of Millie. So the npxt time
you see her, smile and sav "hello."
