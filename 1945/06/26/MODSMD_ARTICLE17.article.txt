The San Francisco Conference
The San Francisco Confeijence is about to wind up,
but it will do so with pageantry, with President Tru
man speaking, and the delegates signing the charter on
a large, wooden table in the Veterans' Auditorium,
the United Nations' Flags surrounding them.
The main issues have been decided, if not settled,
how ( ever. It is possible, therefore, to look at the con
ference with a retrospective eye. But, before we can
comment, we'must try to ascertain the weaknesses
and the strengths which molded it.
WEAKNESSES APPARENT
The weaknesses were perhaps more apparent than
the strengths, but they were more superficial. The
first of them was that the conference was called to
consider the admittedly imperfect Dumbarton Oaks
proposals. Any amendment to them required a two
thrids majority, and this was exceedingly hard to get.
Thus, any particularly radical change was prevented.
Sjecondly, the larger nations were not above using
power tactics to gain their points, and it should be
admitted that if there are durable results in the field
of international organization, more reason and less
pressure is required. Thirdly, fear acted as a cloture
debate. It is significant to note, in this respect, that
the small nations were usually represented by either
the South Anyjrican republics or by the British do
minions. These states were bound together in security
blocs and protected by a major nation. Thus they could
say what they pleased, even go against their protectors,
and yet they would still be immune from diplomatic
pressure in its heavier sense. The smaller nations did
not hav,e this protection, as one delegate of a typical
state in this category confided to me, simply didn't
dare talk too much.
STRENGTHS
But the major strengths of the conference were the
indiscernable, yet powerful, will to accomplish of the
delegates, and the force of public opinion on the out
side. Everyone was determined to do something, and
this determination often prevented the machinery of
discussion from breaking down during periods of fric
tion and deadlock.
