### CYCLONE COVEY 
BLOOD ON THE SUN, now playing at the Stan
ford, is a potboiler distortion of Japanese history
concerned with the Tanaka Memorandum and the
discovery of that document by the American press.
The Tanaka Memorandum was a plan of world con
quest formulated in 1927 in the ministry of Baron

Giichi Tanaka, whose aggressive
Seiyukai party had displaced the
moderate Minseito government ear
lier in the same year. Disclosure of
the Memorandum created something
of a sensation, but its significance in
the picture is exaggerated out of all
proportion. It did not. for instance,
cause the fall of the Tanaka govern
ment, and certainly Tojo and Yama
moto did not take over when it did
fall—as the picture purports. In

fact, Tanaka's government was succeeded by the most
liberal party government Japan ever had.
Because the historical basis of the picture is pre
sented rather incomprehensibly, it may be of some
help to those who see the show to quote here the meat
of the actual Tanaka document. It reads:
"In order to conquer the world, we must first con
quer China. In order to conquer China, we must first
conquer Manchuria and Mongolia .... Sooner or later
we shall have to fight against Soviet Russia .... One
day we shall have to fight against America."
So much for history. The real purpose of the pot
boiler is not historical but to cash in on anti-Japanese
sentiment and to exploit James Cagney's judo prize
fighting. It also includes the lame reappearance of
Sylvia Sydney, who used to have more vitamin B-t,
though perhaps she was only suppressed into Director
Frank Lloyd's impression of an oriental female spy.
The telling of the story is neither clear, connected,
nor convincing, though it is to be admitted that the
sense ol the production was not what the producers
were striving for. And anyhow, there is action enough
to compel attention throughout—which after all is fair
compensation.
James Cagney, as the managing editor of an Ameri
can newspaper in Tokyo, is George M. Cohan, the
Oklahoma Kid. and all his other roles all over again.
Needless to say. since the picture emanates from
Hollywood, the villaincss turns out to be a heroine
and quite capable of being clinched at regularly
spaced intervals by Cagney, whom we knew all along
was present for more than to spout epithets at the
Japanese and brandish the American Hag.

and quite capable of being clinched at regularly
spaced intervals by Cagney, whom we knew all along
was present for more than to spout epithets at the
Japanese and brandish the American Hag.

BLOOD ON THE SUN, now playing at the Stan
ford, is a potboiler distortion of Japanese history
concerned with the Tanaka Memorandum and the
discovery of that document by the American press.
The Tanaka Memorandum was a plan of world con
quest formulated in 1927 in the ministry of Baron

Giichi Tanaka, whose aggressive
Seiyukai party had displaced the
moderate Minseito government ear
lier in the same year. Disclosure of
the Memorandum created something
of a sensation, but its significance in
the picture is exaggerated out of all
proportion. It did not. for instance,
cause the fall of the Tanaka govern
ment, and certainly Tojo and Yama
moto did not take over when it did
fall—as the picture purports. In

fact, Tanaka's government was succeeded by the most
liberal party government Japan ever had.
Because the historical basis of the picture is pre
sented rather incomprehensibly, it may be of some
help to those who see the show to quote here the meat
of the actual Tanaka document. It reads:
"In order to conquer the world, we must first con
quer China. In order to conquer China, we must first
conquer Manchuria and Mongolia .... Sooner or later
we shall have to fight against Soviet Russia .... One
day we shall have to fight against America."
So much for history. The real purpose of the pot
boiler is not historical but to cash in on anti-Japanese
sentiment and to exploit James Cagney's judo prize
fighting. It also includes the lame reappearance of
Sylvia Sydney, who used to have more vitamin B-t,
though perhaps she was only suppressed into Director
Frank Lloyd's impression of an oriental female spy.
The telling of the story is neither clear, connected,
nor convincing, though it is to be admitted that the
sense ol the production was not what the producers
were striving for. And anyhow, there is action enough
to compel attention throughout—which after all is fair
compensation.
James Cagney, as the managing editor of an Ameri
can newspaper in Tokyo, is George M. Cohan, the
Oklahoma Kid. and all his other roles all over again.
Needless to say. since the picture emanates from
Hollywood, the villaincss turns out to be a heroine
and quite capable of being clinched at regularly
spaced intervals by Cagney, whom we knew all along
was present for more than to spout epithets at the
Japanese and brandish the American Hag.
