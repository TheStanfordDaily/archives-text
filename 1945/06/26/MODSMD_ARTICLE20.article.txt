THE FARM, A BATTLEFIELD?
To The Editor:
We love Stanford, and there are
two components of this love. The
first, the smaller, is the pretty, but
childish love we have simply be
cause we are here, just as the child
loves its parents, good or bad. But
the second, greater part of our love,
the mature love, is based on Stan
ford's goodness.
EXCELLENT FACILITIES, BUT—
Stanford is a great University,
world known; it has excellent li
braries and other facilities, an il
lustrious faculty, and above all we
ar,e ever conscious that here live
ideals which others only talk about.
But, because our love is mature,
it involves us in responsibilities. It
demands that we perpetuate what is
good and fight what is bad; it means
that we must ever be on the alert
to make Stanford even greater, for
it goes without saying that it is not
yet perfect.
FROM ROUGH TO ROBOT
In order that we might more eas
ily do our duty, a few weaknesses

should be pointed out: falling scho
lastic standards and the shameful
clowning of instructors in certain
freshman courses, the perversion of
the term "Stanford Gentleman" by
the Dean of Men to mean "sissy"
and "robot," the incongruous in
verse relation of the great number
of highly paid dieticians and the
bland (or more often nauseous)
menus, rudeness to the students by
administrative and other campus
employees and lastly, those forces
which on the one hand attempt to
contaminate us with Victorian mo
rality and unrealistic thinking, es
pecially in politics and economics,
and on the other foster the playful,
uns,<?rious attitude towards educa
tion in general.
Of course a battle may start any
place, but we realize our responsi-l
bility; why not start on the above
mentioned grounds?
