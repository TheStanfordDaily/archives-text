SAN FRANCISCO, June 26—''I
shall send this Charter to the
United States Senate at once. I am
sure that the overwhelming senti
ment of the people of my country
and of their representatives in the
Senate is in favor of immediate
ratification."
With these words. President
Truman promised speedy Ameri
can consideration of the UNICO.
But he also spoke on the signi
ficance of the conference, the fu
ture problems of the United Na
tions, and the principles on which
the Charter is based.
He* spoke of the Charter as a
'"solid structure upon which we can
build a better world." "History will
honor you for it,"he said to the
delegates, telling them that they had
"won a victory against war itself."
He later added, "If we had this
Charter a few years ago—and above
all, the will to use it —millions now
dead would be alive. If we should
falter in the future in our will to
use it, millions: now living will sure
ly die."
He spoke of the principle of co
operation as cardinal, saying that
it had won the war, and that the
basis for it in the realm of win
ning the peace, had been laid in
the various conferences leading to
San Francisco.
"What you have accomplished in
San Francisco shows how well these
lessons of military and economic co
operation have been learned. You
have created a great instrument for
peace and security and human prog
ress."
He warned, however, that the
world must use it, and that, if we
fail to, "we shall betray all those
who have died in order that we
might meet here in freedom and
safety to create it." He also branded
as betrayal any tendency to use the
Charter for the benefit of a small
group of nations.
He also warned: "all Fascism
did not die with Mussolini. Hitler
is finished—but the seeds spread
by his disordered mind have firm
root in too many fanatical brains."
"The forces of reaction and tyran
ny all over the world will try to
keep the United Nations from re
maining United," he further stated,
but he went on to express firm be
lief in their failure.
He said that economic co-opera
tion, as well as military co-opera
tion, is necessary in maintaining
lasting peace. He also declared that
social injustice is a root of war, but
that:
Under this document we have
good reason to expect the framing

of an international hill of rights. :
acceptable to all the nations in- j
volved."
He spoke to all the delegates, and |
a packed press and guest session. ;
Crowds thronged around the loud- j
speakers outside the Opera House.
Secretary Stettinius presided at to
day's Plenary Session, and he, Eng- j
land's Earl of Halifax, Paul Ban- !
cour of France, and Field-Marshal
Jan Christian Smuts, as well as 1
other delegates, made speeches pre- j
ceding the President's.
