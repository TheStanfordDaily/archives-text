PROGRESS AT LAST
A telegram from Washington, D.C., recently
informed our special delivery man, Mr. Rob
ert Collyer, that the Postal Pay Increase Bill
has been passed by the Senate and is now await
ing the signature of President Truman to make
the measure effective.
H.R. 3035 passed the House nearly a month
ago by only one dissenting vote; recorded vote
stands 360 to 1. Ever since this vote, it has
been lateral-passed from Senate committee to
sub-committee and back again, until at last H.R.
3035 has been confirmed unanimously by the
nation's voting Senators.
This passage means that the special delivery
messengers, who have "long and patiently
awaited some improvement in their almost
hopeless situation, will become a part of the
Post Office and will be given much more fair
and eguitable treatment."
The bill will remove many inequities which
have existed far too long in the postal service
and will assist the post office in procuring and
retaining more competent employees in one of
the government's most efficient and hard-work
ing agencies."
Calling for an average upward adjustment
of pay rates by $400 annually, H.R. 3035 repre
sents the first piece of legislaton that has pro
vided for a general basic increase in the salaries
of postal service employees since 1925. In its
original state, the bill did not include special
delivery messengers; it was only through edi
torials and letters and telegrams to authorized
officials that the special delivery men were in
cluded in H.R. 3035.
It was our own special delivery man, Mr.
Collyer, who incited both students and faculty
members of the Stanford Family as well as other
local residents to write their Washington rep
resentatives "concerning the inertia of the post
office in urging full effect of this bill."
And for their co-operation in writing to Sena
tors, Mr. Collyer wishes to thank Deans J. Hugh
Jackson and Charles V. Taylor, Dr. Thomas S.
Barclay, Dean Mary Yost, Miss Nina Almond,
Dr. Ernest R. Hilgard, Dr. W. S. Hopkins and
Miss Helena Nye, who among many others
helped toward changing another bill into a law.
