### BARNEY GUGEL 
A SUCCESS STORY
Many, many years ago, in the small Midwest town
of Outhouse Corners, Kansas, a most unusual child
was born. His name was Horace Biscuit. Doctors, ob
serving the shape of the infant's head, realized almost
immediately that the child would some day make a
name for himself. There was some question as to what
kind of a name, however.
On the day Horace Biscuit turned five, he com
pletely amazed everybody by speaking his first words.

His mother had wanted him to say "mama" first and
his father had wanted him to say "papa" first, but he
fooled them both by quipping, "Ninety per cent of
Stanford students don't drink."
Shortly after young Horace turned ten, his father
asked him the sum of two plus two.
"Three," answered the boy proudly.
Father Biscuit decided then and there it was time
to send his son to grammar school.
Horace worked hard in grammar school, especially
in mathematics, but whenever he was asked the sum
of two plus two, he would always give the wrong an
swer. In high school it was the same story.
Not one to be easily discouraged, young Horace de
cided to go to college in order to solve the enigma.
As a student of hygiene, he discovered many interest
ing facts. For example, "Smoking cuts your wind";
"Pajamas on the floor breed germs and are therefore
unhealthy," and "Only high-type, clean-cut kids at
tain success in the world." Horace also took many
courses in mathematics but was still unable to ascer
tain the sum of two plus two.
Unlike most college students ,he never learned that
one doesn't draw to an inside straight. As a matter of
fact, he never learned to play poker. The reason for
this was a fear that if he bet two chips and was raised
two. he would be unable to put the right number of
chips in the pot.
Horace Biscuit was made of stronger stuff than
most men, though, and after graduating from college
managed to talk Albert Einstein into giving him spe
cial coaching on the subject of two plus two. Finally,
after three years, Einstein decided it was time to quiz
his pupil.
"Horace," asked the great mathematician, "What is
2x plus 2x?"
"1-A," answered the apprentice.
Einstein admitted that it was a damn clever guess,
but felt that Horace ought to find a more advanced
teacher.
It seemed as though the boy would crack under the
blow of his latest failure, but in a stroke of genius he
hit upon the idea which was to completely change his
life. "All my life," he thought, "people have been ask
ing me the sum of two plus two. Maybe if I ask
somebody for a change, I can find out the answer."
Completely carried away, Horace rushed down to
the street corner where he asked an itinerant Italian
fish peddler the sum of two plus two.
"Shesa four," answered the man. "Wassa matter,
you craz?"
Horace, elated because he now knew what the
score was, immediately bought himself a pogo stick
and headed out to California where he has become
an atheltic coach and building inspector of great re
nown.
