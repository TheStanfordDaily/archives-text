### CYCLONE COVEY 
ALFRED FRANKENSTEIN'S Tuesday Series lecture,
"Art into Music," divulged the connection between
Moussorgsky's piano suite, "Pictures at an Exhibition,"
and the works of Victor Hartmann which inspired it.
Bernhard Abi-amowitsch played the music, and slides
were shown both of some of Hartmann's pictures on
which the music was based, and of pictures from a
recent Cleveland exhibition which were based on the
music.
The pictures of the Hartmann memorial exhibition
which Moussorgsky saw were not, it turns out, large
oil paintings, but mostly small works—drawings,
washes, watercolors. And although Hartmann was
primarily an architect and secondarily a theatrical de
signer, Moussorgsky was interested chiefly in Hart
mann's lesser field, sketches of everyday life. And it
was perhaps this interest in life, observed Franken
stein, which made Mossuorgsky the greatest composer
Russia ever produced.
A few of the pictures Moussorgsky selected were
not, however, sketches of life. "The Ballet of the
Chicks in Their Shells," for instance, was a group of
three drawings showing how a boy ballet dancer should
be fitted into an egg-chicken costume. "The Hut on
Fowl's Legs" was an elaborate design of a clock. And
"The Great Gate of Kiev," far from a majestic poi'tal,
was an oddly curved monstrosity which Hartmann en
tered in the contest for a gate to be constructed at Kiev
in commemoration of some czar's escape from assassi
nation. The contest was discontinued and no gate was
ever constructed.
But "The Great Gate of Kiev" is the finest section
of the composition, and it sounds magnificent on the
piano. Ravel's orchestration of the original piano score
was commissioned by Serge Kousevitsky in 1922, and
its immediate popularity has been a large factor in
building the reputation of Moussorgsky over the past
20 years. Two other main factors. Frankenstein said,
were tho popularizing of Moussorgsky vocal music by
Boris Chaliapin, and acceptance bv the modern ear of
many harmonic processes which the people of Moits
sorgky's own age rejected.
Both Hartmann and Moussorgsky were exponents
of Russian nationalism in art. but while Russian na
tionalism achieved well in music and literature, it
achieved badly in architecture and the visual arts. For
this reason Frankenstein questions the concept thr»t ;>!1
arts are one. But he regards "Pictures at an Exhibi
tion" as a unique experiment in how the visual ideas
of a man of modest talent can be turned into the
audible ideas of a man of genius.
