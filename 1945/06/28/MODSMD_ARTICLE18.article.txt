# Scott Praised By General
## 
### 
Charles C. Scott, former instruc
tor of history at Stanford, and now
serving as American Red Cross
Field Director on Okinawa, recently
received high praise for his work
from Gen. James L. Bradley, com
manding general of the 96th Divi
sion.
General Bradley, in naming each
of the team of four field directors
assigned to this unit, said: "Our
Red Cross unit is worth its weigh
in gold. We couldn't ask for a bet
ter team of workers. They've done
a truly wonderful job, both her.i
and when we were on Leyte. Ml
wish would be for more men of
their caliber."
The commander of the "Dead
eyes" was particularly compliment
ary when speaking about the coffee
and doughnuts which were served
to the men in the front lines during
the first three weeks of the cam
paignâ€”a service arranged by the
Red Cross workers and carried out
with the assistance of scores of GI
volunteers until company field
kitchens were in full operation.
Mr. Scott is a native of Twit-
Falls, Idaho. He received his A.B.
from Stanford in 1927, M.A. in 192V
and Ph.D. in 1940.
