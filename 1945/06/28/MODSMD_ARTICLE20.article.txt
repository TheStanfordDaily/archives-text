# De Young Exhibits Old Bridal Costumes
## 
### 
"June Brides," a new exhibition
j at the De Young Museum, will be
! on view during the entire month.
Nearly a century of wedding
dresses, treasured by their owners
and passed on from generation to
generation, is spanned in the pres
i ent show, whose earliest "model'
! dates from 1824. Each gown is rep
] resentative of the style of its day.
One finds the slender silhouette
: of the late Empire period, the enor
mous hoopskirt of the middle of
the century, and the 21-inch waist
line of the 80's in luscious damasks,
satins and silks.
