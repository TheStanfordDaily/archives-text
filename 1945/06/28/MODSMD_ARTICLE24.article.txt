Aside from the theory and idle
conjectures that have heretofore
appeared in this column for lack of
something better to write about,
this attempt will deal with the Stan
ford athletic situation which is be
coming increasingly important as
the return of intercollegiate athlet
ics becomes more and more immi
nent.
Basketball seems to be first on the
docket in the Stanford return to
sports. It is far too early to deter
mine the success of such a team, but
one thing is certain and that we
definitely have the best coach in the
conference, and if the possibility of
a winning team is there Head Coach
Everett Dean will certainly come
out with a top notch squad.
The choice of Coach Dean as one
of the men to help in the sports
rehabilitation program in Italy was
no chance selection, for he is noted
for his ability to teach in a thor
ough manner, a teaching that sticks
in the minds of his squad members
whether they be Stanford basket
ball players or someone who has
never seen a ball before. This fact
is aptly evidenced by his string ot
proteges who have gone on and de
veloped successful teams of their

own or have gone to other schools
since the cessation of basketball at
Stanford, such as Howie Dallmarr,
who was acclaimed by the Pennsyl
vania University coach as one of the
most outstanding guards he has ever
seen .
All in all the prospects do not as
yet look too bright, and Stanford
will in all probability get stepped on
by schools, who have been develop
ing basketball, football, and base
ball teams in spite of the present
war. Even in our jubilation we can
not help overlook the fact that we
could have fielded excellent basket
ball and track teams this past year.
Such basketball stars as Morley
Thompson, Dave Brown, and Jack
Heald are lost to us now, and such
Olympic Club point getters as Ed
Luce, Gordon Levy, Emerson Hiler,
and Gordon Dunn will probably be
gone by next track season.
Intramural activities have always
been one outlet for our cry for ath
letics, but it seems as though inter
est is sadly lacking this quarter.
Only four teams have signed up to
date and it takes more than that to
instill a competitive spirit in the
teams that want to play. Teams
that have signed up thus far are the
Firehouse, Tyler '"Hilltoppers,"
Flacs, and the "Independents" or
what is left of Monroe's spring quar
ter ten. As yet no teams from Toy
on, the largest men's hall on the
campus, have signed the list which
is posted in the men's gym. The
CATS are also ugred to enter a team
or two in this league which should
start next week if the signup is
large enough.

Luce, Gordon Levy, Emerson Hiler,
and Gordon Dunn will probably be
gone by next track season.
Intramural activities have always
been one outlet for our cry for ath
letics, but it seems as though inter
est is sadly lacking this quarter.
Only four teams have signed up to
date and it takes more than that to
instill a competitive spirit in the
teams that want to play. Teams
that have signed up thus far are the
Firehouse, Tyler '"Hilltoppers,"
Flacs, and the "Independents" or
what is left of Monroe's spring quar
ter ten. As yet no teams from Toy
on, the largest men's hall on the
campus, have signed the list which
is posted in the men's gym. The
CATS are also ugred to enter a team
or two in this league which should
start next week if the signup is
large enough.
Aside from the theory and idle
conjectures that have heretofore
appeared in this column for lack of
something better to write about,
this attempt will deal with the Stan
ford athletic situation which is be
coming increasingly important as
the return of intercollegiate athlet
ics becomes more and more immi
nent.
Basketball seems to be first on the
docket in the Stanford return to
sports. It is far too early to deter
mine the success of such a team, but
one thing is certain and that we
definitely have the best coach in the
conference, and if the possibility of
a winning team is there Head Coach
Everett Dean will certainly come
out with a top notch squad.
The choice of Coach Dean as one
of the men to help in the sports
rehabilitation program in Italy was
no chance selection, for he is noted
for his ability to teach in a thor
ough manner, a teaching that sticks
in the minds of his squad members
whether they be Stanford basket
ball players or someone who has
never seen a ball before. This fact
is aptly evidenced by his string ot
proteges who have gone on and de
veloped successful teams of their

own or have gone to other schools
since the cessation of basketball at
Stanford, such as Howie Dallmarr,
who was acclaimed by the Pennsyl
vania University coach as one of the
most outstanding guards he has ever
seen .
All in all the prospects do not as
yet look too bright, and Stanford
will in all probability get stepped on
by schools, who have been develop
ing basketball, football, and base
ball teams in spite of the present
war. Even in our jubilation we can
not help overlook the fact that we
could have fielded excellent basket
ball and track teams this past year.
Such basketball stars as Morley
Thompson, Dave Brown, and Jack
Heald are lost to us now, and such
Olympic Club point getters as Ed
Luce, Gordon Levy, Emerson Hiler,
and Gordon Dunn will probably be
gone by next track season.
