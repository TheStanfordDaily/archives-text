# Coast League In Tight Race
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
As Pacific Coast baseball ap
proaches the mid-season mark, the
final league standings are becoming
fairly evident. If not too many old
sters falter, or too many teen-agers
fall apart, the league will rack up
similar to the way it stands now.
At the top of the league are the
Portland Beavers. Paced by such
heavy swatters as Demaree, Owens,
and Barton, steady pitching by Ad
Liska, the old submariner, and Har
ry Cohen, the Oregon boys are mak
ing a clean sweep of the league.
The second - place niche is now
held by Emil Sick's Seattle crew.
The mainstay of the mound staff is
Hal Turpin. Big guns in the infield
are Aleno and Mac Donald, and the
leading flyhawk is Ted Norbert.
Bob Joyce, already a 16 - game
winner, and Mailho, leading clouter
of the league, are the two main rea
sons why Lefty O'Doul's trained
Seals are holding down third spot
in the league.
The next five places are a scram
ble between Oakland, Sacramento,
Los Angeles, and San Diego. The
Oaks are now without the mana
gerial services of Dolph Camilli. Too
many duties on his big ranch was
the excuse, but strangely enough, he
now finds time to play for the Bos
ton Red Sox in the American
League. Lqf> Angeles, even with
the services of Larrupin' Lou Novi
koff, can't seem to find themselves.
Even thou San Diego has new own
ers, a new manager, and practically
all new players, they're still haunt
ing old grounds: the bottom half of
second division.
Floundering about in last place
are the twinkleless Hollywood Stars.
With a certain amount of diligence
and care, they ought to have no
trouble in keeping their present po
sition.
