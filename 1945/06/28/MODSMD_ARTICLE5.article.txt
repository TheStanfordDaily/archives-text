# Farm Students Urged to Make Blood Doning Appointments
## 
### 
Have you ever given your blood
to save a fighting man p
Now is your opportunity. Farm
students are asked to donate their
blood on the first and third Thurs
days of each month. One week from
today is the first Thursday in July.

There is now a sign-up sheet for j
appointments on the bulletin board i
on the Engineering corner. It will ;
remain there until Sunday, at which I
time it will be transferred to Lagu
nita. At the hall the remaining api
pointments will be filled.
Appointments may be made for
11:20 and 11:40 a.m. and 1:20 and;
1:40 p.m. Transportation will be j
furnished by the Red Cross to the
Palo Alto Community Center, if a |
request is written with the appoint- j
ment. Those desiring transporta- j
tion should be at the Engineering |
corner 20 minutes before the ap
pointment time.
Anyone 18 years or older may
give blood if he is in good health,
but all those under 21 must have
their parents' signed permission on
a blank which may be obtained at
the War Board office in the A.S.S.U.
building.
Stanford has filled its quota of 30
donors each time, announced Jean
Richards, Blood Bank chairman,
and she hopes that the good record
will continue.
