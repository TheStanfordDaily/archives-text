# Dr. Trueblood, Soon to Retire, Reviews Nine Years at Stanford
## 
### 
"I have resigned in a very leisure
ly manner," said Dr. D. Elton True
blood, chaplain and professor of
philosophy of religion. "I'll be here
two more quarters, giving the Board
lots of time to find a successor."

Looking; hack on his stay at
Stanford, he considers it a long
and very fortunate chapter of his
life. Dr. Truehlood is very grate
ful for the amount of co-operation
he has had from the students and
faculty and appreciates especially
the increasingly large chapel at
tendance, which, he believes, is
the largest of any university
chapel.
Dr. Trueblood received his A.B.
from Penn College in 1922. There
he distinguished himself in foot
ball. public speaking and debating.
At the age of 19 he was undecided
as to whether he wanted to be an
author, minister or college profes
sor. "I ended up by being all three,"
he says.
From Penn he went to Harvard,
obtaining his S.T.B. in 192G. He
taught philosophy at Guilford
College in North Carolina, where
he was also Dean of iVlen. and at
Haverford. In 19.14 he received
his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins,
Besides a number of articles for
such magazines as the Atlantic
Monthly he has written five books:
"The Essence of Spiritual Religion,"
"The Trustworthiness of Religious
Experience." "The Knowledge of
God" (a Book of the Month selec
tion for the Religious Book of the
Month Club)."The Logic of Belief,"
and"The Predicament of Man."

which, published less than a year j
ago. is a best-seller.
Dr. Trueblood came to Stanford
in 19.'56. Reviewing his work here
he says: "In these nine years the
chief thing for religious activity j
has been to introduce the active !
participation of students and fac
ulty into religious life. Religion is
not something for the students |
hut an expression of their deepest
life."
Discussing the various facilities
at Stanford he talks fondly of the
Cellar: "Dark and ugly as it may
be, I love it. The founders intended
that the center of spiritual life
should be Memorial Church. It is
still that in theory, but actually it
is the Cellar. I highly approve."
His plans for the future are not
definite as yet; however, it is his
great concern to help to restore
the integrity of American educa
tion. "At present," he points out. j
"a college degree means absolute
ly nothing. You don't know any
thing about a man now when he !
has an A.B. I'd like to see the
degree made honest. You should
not teach students about a sub
ject. hut bring them into direct
contact with it. My thoughts on
education can he summed up by
Whitehead's statement: 'Moral ed
ucation is important apart from
the habitual vision of greatness.'"

Discussing the various facilities
at Stanford he talks fondly of the

"I have resigned in a very leisure
ly manner," said Dr. D. Elton True
blood, chaplain and professor of
philosophy of religion. "I'll be here
two more quarters, giving the Board
lots of time to find a successor."

Looking; hack on his stay at
Stanford, he considers it a long
and very fortunate chapter of his
life. Dr. Truehlood is very grate
ful for the amount of co-operation
he has had from the students and
faculty and appreciates especially
the increasingly large chapel at
tendance, which, he believes, is
the largest of any university
chapel.
Dr. Trueblood received his A.B.
from Penn College in 1922. There
he distinguished himself in foot
ball. public speaking and debating.
At the age of 19 he was undecided
as to whether he wanted to be an
author, minister or college profes
sor. "I ended up by being all three,"
he says.
From Penn he went to Harvard,
obtaining his S.T.B. in 192G. He
taught philosophy at Guilford
College in North Carolina, where
he was also Dean of iVlen. and at
Haverford. In 19.14 he received
his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins,
Besides a number of articles for
such magazines as the Atlantic
Monthly he has written five books:
"The Essence of Spiritual Religion,"
"The Trustworthiness of Religious
Experience." "The Knowledge of
God" (a Book of the Month selec
tion for the Religious Book of the
Month Club)."The Logic of Belief,"
and"The Predicament of Man."

which, published less than a year j
ago. is a best-seller.
Dr. Trueblood came to Stanford
in 19.'56. Reviewing his work here
he says: "In these nine years the
chief thing for religious activity j
has been to introduce the active !
participation of students and fac
ulty into religious life. Religion is
not something for the students |
hut an expression of their deepest
life."
