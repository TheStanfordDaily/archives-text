# Spalding Uncovers War Documents
## 
### BILL EILERS 
Back to Palo Alto last week from
first-line European Research came
Dr. Merrill Spalding, Research As
sociate of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution and Peace. During
the past months he had landed on
the French Coast in an LST, had
been arrested by the Swiss Govern
ment, brushed with the underground,
had seen Paris friends pay $7 for
h Spam sandwich. Most important;
he (1) uncovered priceless docu
ments—newspapers, books, leaflets—
invaluable to the Library's unique
collection (2) arranged to have other
collections shipped as restrictions re
laxed.
The story begin in Autumn, 1930.
Stanford observers saw the necessity
of opening channels and renewing
contacts to obtain historical informa
tion as the war gathered momentum.
Doctor Ralph Lutz. a director of the
Hoover Research Institute, was
chosen to visit Switzerland, Ger
many, Spain. Russia, Finland, Bel
gium. and France. He was to check
on committees already gathering in
formation for the Institute, organize
new channels such as Nazi party
leaders, and provide to have many
government and private sources save
pertinent documents concerning the

war.
Then, as V-E day approached,
Library officials considered it
i wise to send again a researcher to
Western Europe. He would re
new contacts, gather all the im
mediate information available.
Several weeks later. Doctor Spald
ing landed on a French beach in
an LST since harhors were still
| cluttered with debris.
j In view of the unique character of
I Hoover Research Institute, American
! government officials provided every
cooperation to aid him in gathering
his material. In return, he promised
to furnish Army and government
archives with duplicate copies when
possible.
In France, Dr. Spalding found all
newpapers and magazines under rig
id control. Collaborationist papers
were non-existant; others, like Popu
late, Humanite and Figaro, are
printing newsprint-shortage editions
the size of this Stanford Daily. Most
magazines approach the Nation and
New Republic type since govern-
I tnent control denies pulp publication.
Dr. Spalding arranged to have
complete files of more than twen
ty Paris dailies, published since
the liberation. Additional provin
cial papers and weeklies will raise

the score to well over sixty.
While accumulating his material,
he discovered the old French War
'.Library, occupying an ancient chat
eau at Vincennes. Much valuable in
iformation had been destroyed by the
retreating Germans.
The French are very eager to ex
change. Their libraries, deprived of
American literature since German
occupation, anxiously made arrange
ments to trade much valuable ma
terial in cooperation with the Am
erican Library Association.
A special committee in Paris is
also gathering background notes and
documents. The Hoover foundation
also hopes to cooperate with repre
sentatives of the French Army, a
French group of the National
Archives, those who hold publica
tions of the Vichy government, and
the more important libraries in
Paris.
Doctor Spalding also visited the
French Provisional Library at Dijon.
Original copies of authentic war
volumes will go to the Hoover Li
brary. with copies to be made avail
able to other United States libraries.
He interviewed booksellers and
printers in France who printed
or saved underground communica-
(ions. Even under the ever-watch
ful Gestapo, Paris printers were
able to operate. An importer hid
underground publications under a
staircase in his home. German
officers used the staircase, but
didn't discover the secret. Houses
nearby were destroyed by gun
fire. Some of this hidden material
is now on its way to the Hoover
Library.
A new war library is being set up
in Brussels by the Belgian professor.
Madame Charlier visited Stanford's
Hoover Library several years ago
and became so interested that she
has presuaded her country to docu
ment the war in this way.
Ihere was one disappointing fac
tor in Doctor Spalding's trip. In
Antwerp when the famed—or ill
famed—V-l bombs came over, he
was shocked at the people's "ut
ter indifference" to the air raid
sirens. They only ducked when
they heard the whir of the bombs,
and Doctor Spalding was amused
to see one older man very pleased
with himself for having recovered
an extra-large piece of metal from
a bomb. But the Belgian civilians
beat him to the souvencirs; the
Hoover Library will be without
V-l shrapnel.
In fact, European civilians became
so oblivious to the bombings, said
Dr. Spalding, that even "petting
parties went right on during the
alerts.
Trying to track down the source
of a Trotsky newspaper provided ex
citement during the trip. False ad
dresses, wrong tips, red tape, and
difficult transportation facilities
make the life of a research man in
Europe very hectic.
In Germany, the Hoover investi
gator found anti-American propa
ganda amazingly exaggerated. Dis
torted pictures of American life were
typical: one headline read "J. P.
Morgan Buys Africa."
He is very proud of a copy of the
first newspaper published by the
American Government in Ger
many. The editors had a dis
couraging time: German printers
were extremely reluctant to work,
writers were hard to find, distri
bution was impaired by necessary
occupational priority.
Information on propaganda broad
casting was pretty fragmentary. The
best came from the International
Radio Bureau in Geneva and from
the French monitoring service. Doc
tor Spalding visited over 20 different
international organizations in Switz
erland, including the YMCA, Red
Cross and educational organizations.
In England, he found most of the
research being done by the Library's
agency there. But he did make ar
rangements to obtain copies of all the
leaflets dropped over Europe in the
Psychological Warfare Campaign.
"Ihere s need of a strong
O.P.A. in Europe, commented
Dr. Spalding. The Parisian black
market is flourishing with meal
prices ranging 810-20 and more.
On the other hand, the black
market is practically non-existant
under strict Swiss control.
Predicted Dr. Spalding of the
French information he gathered:
"The Hoover Library should have
an unusually good background on
the resistance and liberation move
ments in France . . . most difficult to
obtain because much of the infor
mation has to be dug out from un
derground sources and was carried
on underground."
Dr. Spalding will instruct at Stan
ford summer quarter and continue to
assemble and sort his material for
filing in the Hoover Library.

Dr. Spalding. The Parisian black
market is flourishing with meal
prices ranging 810-20 and more.
On the other hand, the black
market is practically non-existant
under strict Swiss control.
Predicted Dr. Spalding of the
French information he gathered:
"The Hoover Library should have
an unusually good background on
the resistance and liberation move
ments in France . . . most difficult to
obtain because much of the infor
mation has to be dug out from un
derground sources and was carried
on underground."
Dr. Spalding will instruct at Stan
ford summer quarter and continue to
assemble and sort his material for
filing in the Hoover Library.
Back to Palo Alto last week from
first-line European Research came
Dr. Merrill Spalding, Research As
sociate of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution and Peace. During
the past months he had landed on
the French Coast in an LST, had
been arrested by the Swiss Govern
ment, brushed with the underground,
had seen Paris friends pay $7 for
h Spam sandwich. Most important;
he (1) uncovered priceless docu
ments—newspapers, books, leaflets—
invaluable to the Library's unique
collection (2) arranged to have other
collections shipped as restrictions re
laxed.
The story begin in Autumn, 1930.
Stanford observers saw the necessity
of opening channels and renewing
contacts to obtain historical informa
tion as the war gathered momentum.
Doctor Ralph Lutz. a director of the
Hoover Research Institute, was
chosen to visit Switzerland, Ger
many, Spain. Russia, Finland, Bel
gium. and France. He was to check
on committees already gathering in
formation for the Institute, organize
new channels such as Nazi party
leaders, and provide to have many
government and private sources save
pertinent documents concerning the

war.
Then, as V-E day approached,
Library officials considered it
i wise to send again a researcher to
Western Europe. He would re
new contacts, gather all the im
mediate information available.
Several weeks later. Doctor Spald
ing landed on a French beach in
an LST since harhors were still
| cluttered with debris.
j In view of the unique character of
I Hoover Research Institute, American
! government officials provided every
cooperation to aid him in gathering
his material. In return, he promised
to furnish Army and government
archives with duplicate copies when
possible.
In France, Dr. Spalding found all
newpapers and magazines under rig
id control. Collaborationist papers
were non-existant; others, like Popu
late, Humanite and Figaro, are
printing newsprint-shortage editions
the size of this Stanford Daily. Most
magazines approach the Nation and
New Republic type since govern-
I tnent control denies pulp publication.
Dr. Spalding arranged to have
complete files of more than twen
ty Paris dailies, published since
the liberation. Additional provin
cial papers and weeklies will raise

the score to well over sixty.
While accumulating his material,
he discovered the old French War
'.Library, occupying an ancient chat
eau at Vincennes. Much valuable in
iformation had been destroyed by the
retreating Germans.
The French are very eager to ex
change. Their libraries, deprived of
American literature since German
occupation, anxiously made arrange
ments to trade much valuable ma
terial in cooperation with the Am
erican Library Association.
A special committee in Paris is
also gathering background notes and
documents. The Hoover foundation
also hopes to cooperate with repre
sentatives of the French Army, a
French group of the National
Archives, those who hold publica
tions of the Vichy government, and
the more important libraries in
Paris.
Doctor Spalding also visited the
French Provisional Library at Dijon.
Original copies of authentic war
volumes will go to the Hoover Li
brary. with copies to be made avail
able to other United States libraries.
He interviewed booksellers and
printers in France who printed
or saved underground communica-
(ions. Even under the ever-watch
ful Gestapo, Paris printers were
able to operate. An importer hid
underground publications under a
staircase in his home. German
officers used the staircase, but
didn't discover the secret. Houses
nearby were destroyed by gun
fire. Some of this hidden material
is now on its way to the Hoover
Library.
A new war library is being set up
in Brussels by the Belgian professor.
Madame Charlier visited Stanford's
Hoover Library several years ago
and became so interested that she
has presuaded her country to docu
ment the war in this way.
Ihere was one disappointing fac
tor in Doctor Spalding's trip. In
Antwerp when the famed—or ill
famed—V-l bombs came over, he
was shocked at the people's "ut
ter indifference" to the air raid
sirens. They only ducked when
they heard the whir of the bombs,
and Doctor Spalding was amused
to see one older man very pleased
with himself for having recovered
an extra-large piece of metal from
a bomb. But the Belgian civilians
beat him to the souvencirs; the
Hoover Library will be without
V-l shrapnel.
In fact, European civilians became
so oblivious to the bombings, said
Dr. Spalding, that even "petting
parties went right on during the
alerts.
Trying to track down the source
of a Trotsky newspaper provided ex
citement during the trip. False ad
dresses, wrong tips, red tape, and
difficult transportation facilities
make the life of a research man in
Europe very hectic.
In Germany, the Hoover investi
gator found anti-American propa
ganda amazingly exaggerated. Dis
torted pictures of American life were
typical: one headline read "J. P.
Morgan Buys Africa."
He is very proud of a copy of the
first newspaper published by the
American Government in Ger
many. The editors had a dis
couraging time: German printers
were extremely reluctant to work,
writers were hard to find, distri
bution was impaired by necessary
occupational priority.
Information on propaganda broad
casting was pretty fragmentary. The
best came from the International
Radio Bureau in Geneva and from
the French monitoring service. Doc
tor Spalding visited over 20 different
international organizations in Switz
erland, including the YMCA, Red
Cross and educational organizations.
In England, he found most of the
research being done by the Library's
agency there. But he did make ar
rangements to obtain copies of all the
leaflets dropped over Europe in the
Psychological Warfare Campaign.

writers were hard to find, distri
bution was impaired by necessary
occupational priority.
Information on propaganda broad
casting was pretty fragmentary. The
best came from the International
Radio Bureau in Geneva and from
the French monitoring service. Doc
tor Spalding visited over 20 different
international organizations in Switz
erland, including the YMCA, Red
Cross and educational organizations.
In England, he found most of the
research being done by the Library's
agency there. But he did make ar
rangements to obtain copies of all the
leaflets dropped over Europe in the
Psychological Warfare Campaign.
"Ihere s need of a strong
O.P.A. in Europe, commented
Dr. Spalding. The Parisian black
market is flourishing with meal
prices ranging 810-20 and more.
On the other hand, the black
market is practically non-existant
under strict Swiss control.
Predicted Dr. Spalding of the
French information he gathered:
"The Hoover Library should have
an unusually good background on
the resistance and liberation move
ments in France . . . most difficult to
obtain because much of the infor
mation has to be dug out from un
derground sources and was carried
on underground."
Dr. Spalding will instruct at Stan
ford summer quarter and continue to
assemble and sort his material for
filing in the Hoover Library.
Back to Palo Alto last week from
first-line European Research came
Dr. Merrill Spalding, Research As
sociate of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution and Peace. During
the past months he had landed on
the French Coast in an LST, had
been arrested by the Swiss Govern
ment, brushed with the underground,
had seen Paris friends pay $7 for
h Spam sandwich. Most important;
he (1) uncovered priceless docu
ments—newspapers, books, leaflets—
invaluable to the Library's unique
collection (2) arranged to have other
collections shipped as restrictions re
laxed.
The story begin in Autumn, 1930.
Stanford observers saw the necessity
of opening channels and renewing
contacts to obtain historical informa
tion as the war gathered momentum.
Doctor Ralph Lutz. a director of the
Hoover Research Institute, was
chosen to visit Switzerland, Ger
many, Spain. Russia, Finland, Bel
gium. and France. He was to check
on committees already gathering in
formation for the Institute, organize
new channels such as Nazi party
leaders, and provide to have many
government and private sources save
pertinent documents concerning the

war.
Then, as V-E day approached,
Library officials considered it
i wise to send again a researcher to
Western Europe. He would re
new contacts, gather all the im
mediate information available.
Several weeks later. Doctor Spald
ing landed on a French beach in
an LST since harhors were still
| cluttered with debris.
j In view of the unique character of
I Hoover Research Institute, American
! government officials provided every
cooperation to aid him in gathering
his material. In return, he promised
to furnish Army and government
archives with duplicate copies when
possible.
In France, Dr. Spalding found all
newpapers and magazines under rig
id control. Collaborationist papers
were non-existant; others, like Popu
late, Humanite and Figaro, are
printing newsprint-shortage editions
the size of this Stanford Daily. Most
magazines approach the Nation and
New Republic type since govern-
I tnent control denies pulp publication.
Dr. Spalding arranged to have
complete files of more than twen
ty Paris dailies, published since
the liberation. Additional provin
cial papers and weeklies will raise

the score to well over sixty.
While accumulating his material,
he discovered the old French War
'.Library, occupying an ancient chat
eau at Vincennes. Much valuable in
iformation had been destroyed by the
retreating Germans.
The French are very eager to ex
change. Their libraries, deprived of
American literature since German
occupation, anxiously made arrange
ments to trade much valuable ma
terial in cooperation with the Am
erican Library Association.
A special committee in Paris is
also gathering background notes and
documents. The Hoover foundation
also hopes to cooperate with repre
sentatives of the French Army, a
French group of the National
Archives, those who hold publica
tions of the Vichy government, and
the more important libraries in
Paris.
Doctor Spalding also visited the
French Provisional Library at Dijon.
Original copies of authentic war
volumes will go to the Hoover Li
brary. with copies to be made avail
able to other United States libraries.
He interviewed booksellers and
printers in France who printed
or saved underground communica-
(ions. Even under the ever-watch
ful Gestapo, Paris printers were
able to operate. An importer hid
underground publications under a
staircase in his home. German
officers used the staircase, but
didn't discover the secret. Houses
nearby were destroyed by gun
fire. Some of this hidden material
is now on its way to the Hoover
Library.
A new war library is being set up
in Brussels by the Belgian professor.
Madame Charlier visited Stanford's
Hoover Library several years ago
and became so interested that she
has presuaded her country to docu
ment the war in this way.
Ihere was one disappointing fac
tor in Doctor Spalding's trip. In
Antwerp when the famed—or ill
famed—V-l bombs came over, he
was shocked at the people's "ut
ter indifference" to the air raid
sirens. They only ducked when
they heard the whir of the bombs,
and Doctor Spalding was amused
to see one older man very pleased
with himself for having recovered
an extra-large piece of metal from
a bomb. But the Belgian civilians
beat him to the souvencirs; the
Hoover Library will be without
V-l shrapnel.
In fact, European civilians became
so oblivious to the bombings, said
Dr. Spalding, that even "petting
parties went right on during the
alerts.
Trying to track down the source
of a Trotsky newspaper provided ex
citement during the trip. False ad
dresses, wrong tips, red tape, and
difficult transportation facilities
make the life of a research man in
Europe very hectic.
In Germany, the Hoover investi
gator found anti-American propa
ganda amazingly exaggerated. Dis
torted pictures of American life were
typical: one headline read "J. P.
Morgan Buys Africa."

alerts.
Trying to track down the source
of a Trotsky newspaper provided ex
citement during the trip. False ad
dresses, wrong tips, red tape, and
difficult transportation facilities
make the life of a research man in
Europe very hectic.
In Germany, the Hoover investi
gator found anti-American propa
ganda amazingly exaggerated. Dis
torted pictures of American life were
typical: one headline read "J. P.
Morgan Buys Africa."
He is very proud of a copy of the
first newspaper published by the
American Government in Ger
many. The editors had a dis
couraging time: German printers
were extremely reluctant to work,
writers were hard to find, distri
bution was impaired by necessary
occupational priority.
Information on propaganda broad
casting was pretty fragmentary. The
best came from the International
Radio Bureau in Geneva and from
the French monitoring service. Doc
tor Spalding visited over 20 different
international organizations in Switz
erland, including the YMCA, Red
Cross and educational organizations.
In England, he found most of the
research being done by the Library's
agency there. But he did make ar
rangements to obtain copies of all the
leaflets dropped over Europe in the
Psychological Warfare Campaign.
"Ihere s need of a strong
O.P.A. in Europe, commented
Dr. Spalding. The Parisian black
market is flourishing with meal
prices ranging 810-20 and more.
On the other hand, the black
market is practically non-existant
under strict Swiss control.
Predicted Dr. Spalding of the
French information he gathered:
"The Hoover Library should have
an unusually good background on
the resistance and liberation move
ments in France . . . most difficult to
obtain because much of the infor
mation has to be dug out from un
derground sources and was carried
on underground."
Dr. Spalding will instruct at Stan
ford summer quarter and continue to
assemble and sort his material for
filing in the Hoover Library.
