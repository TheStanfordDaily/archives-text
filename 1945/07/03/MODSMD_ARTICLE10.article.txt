# Spalding Uncovers War Documents

### BILL EILERS 
Back to Palo Alto last week from
first-line European Research came
Dr. Merrill Spalding, Research As
sociate of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution and Peace. During
the past months he had landed on
the French Coast in an LST, had
been arrested by the Swiss Govern
ment, brushed with the underground,
had seen Paris friends pay $7 for
h Spam sandwich. Most important;
he (1) uncovered priceless docu
ments—newspapers, books, leaflets—
invaluable to the Library's unique
collection (2) arranged to have other
collections shipped as restrictions re
laxed.
The story begin in Autumn, 1930.
Stanford observers saw the necessity
of opening channels and renewing
contacts to obtain historical informa
tion as the war gathered momentum.
Doctor Ralph Lutz. a director of the
Hoover Research Institute, was
chosen to visit Switzerland, Ger
many, Spain. Russia, Finland, Bel
gium. and France. He was to check
on committees already gathering in
formation for the Institute, organize
new channels such as Nazi party
leaders, and provide to have many
government and private sources save
pertinent documents concerning the

war.
Then, as V-E day approached,
Library officials considered it
i wise to send again a researcher to
Western Europe. He would re
new contacts, gather all the im
mediate information available.
Several weeks later. Doctor Spald
ing landed on a French beach in
an EST since harhors were still
| cluttered with debris.
j In view of the unique character of
I Hoover Research Institute, American
! government officials provided every
cooperation to aid him in gathering
his material. In return, he promised
to furnish Army and government
archives with duplicate copies when
possible.
In France, Dr. Spalding found all
newpapers and magazines under rig
id control. Collaborationist papers
were non-existant; others, like Popu
late, Humanite and Figaro, are
printing newsprint-shortage editions
the size of this Stanford Daily. Most
magazines approach the Nation and
New Republic type since govern-
I tnent control denies pulp publication.
Dr. Spalding arranged to have
complete files of more than twen
ty Paris dailies, published since
the liberation. Additional provin
cial papers and weeklies will raise

the score to well over sixty.
While accumulating his material,
he discovered the old French War
'.Library, occupying an ancient chat
eau at Vincennes. Much valuable in
iformation had been destroyed by the
retreating Germans.
The French are very eager to ex
change. Their libraries, deprived of
American literature since German
occupation, anxiously made arrange
ments to trade much valuable ma
terial in cooperation with the Am
erican Library Association.
A special committee in Paris is
also gathering background notes and
documents. The Hoover foundation
also hopes to cooperate with repre
sentatives of the French Army, a
French group of the National
Archives, those who hold publica
tions of the Vichy government, and
the more important libraries in
Paris.
Doctor Spalding also visited the
French Provisional Library at Dijon.
Original copies of authentic war
volumes will go to the Hoover Li
brary. with copies to be made avail
able to other United States libraries.
He interviewed booksellers and
printers in France who printed
or saved underground communica-
