## Wanted: 43 Quad 
### 
In the course of a week, the Daily P.O. box
stores up many requests. These requests ranqe
from "I'm trying to locate a cut which ran in the
Daily Palo Alto May 8, 1924" to "Box Rent Due."
Top letter in this morning's mail bag reads
in part:
"... I have a request—not so unusual per
haps—but one that I sincerely hope you will
be able to fulfill.
"I want very badly to obtain a copy of the
Stanford annual for 1943. The Student Manager
informs me that the Associated Students have
none on hand and I am coming to you in the
hope that you will be able to resurrect a year
book somewhere."
The postmark reads Leamington, Ontario,
Canada.
In forwarding this plea to its readers the Daily
does not doubt that at least one member of the
faculty or student body is interested in spread
ing pro-Stanford propaganda to eastern America.
Nor does the Daily doubt that at least one
member of the Farm Family would be willing to
part with his copy of the '43 Quad.
In the past, some Daily readers have shown
great interest in correcting their newspaper for
statement and opinion. Here's another chance,
reader. That's . . .
