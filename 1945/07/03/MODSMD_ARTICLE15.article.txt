### VIC AND BILL 
What is the cause of the spirit of gloom that has
lately settled over the inhabitants of Encina Hall?
Why are there no more smiles on their faces, no more
long whistles at passers-by on the Engineering Corner.
Maybe it is because the Phillies are languishing in last
place in the National League, or because Breathless
Mahoney has eluded Dick Tracy once again.
But no, it is something deeper, something more im
portant than these^trivial things. Bill the Milkman is
here no more. Yes, Bill the Milkman, whose timely
articles on Encina Chow brought cheers from Army
men and civilians alike; whose words were like sweet
nothings in the ears of such men as the CE-s's. In the
long period of our acquaintance with him and his be
loved chow, we have grown to appreciate him as a
brother. But it had to come sometime and so instead of
shedding tears over his departure, let us rather hope
that he has joined the army again, for the twelfth
time and can again taste those rare delicacies that can
only be served up by a GI cook.

'Twas the night before furlough, and all thru Encina,
Not a creature was stirring, not even the O. D.
. . . . but it wasn't that way for long! The boys had
been to Rosatti's, and on their return decided to sing
a farewell dirge to their departing comrades. The walls
resounded to the strains of "Good Night Sweetheart,"
and "Auld Lang Syne." But crime does not pay,
especially at 2:30 AM, and so the MEs's got the blame
—but we are certain that it was Jackson, Ingram and
company. Anyway, the MEs's went on furlough, while
the latter group stayed behind.

For most of the lads here at Encina, the coming of
summer ended some very intimate affairs. But with
the aid of Simmons' Date Bureau, our lovers are back
in action, as anyone at the Reg Dance can testify.
All the boys seemed to enjoy themselves immensely;
it was difficult to determine who was having the best
time, but we could not avoid noticing our colleagues.

Conspicuous in their absence were Walt Fleher and
his new acquaintance, that cute little Major. Good
work, old man, but fifty bucks a month (less 47) does
not go very far. Speaking oi' Majors, all the privates
out here welcomed as our new Batallion Commander,
Major Duckstad . . . all but Bill Helfand, who told the
Major in no uncertain TERMS, to "get the hell off
the grass." Oi' course it was a case of mistaken identity,
but it took some time to convince Major Duckstad.

Now that love has come to Nathan Pickles, the ro
mance department of the ME6's is complete. Norm has
his Jean, Bill has Amy, Vic has Peg, Kieth has Strass,
and Bob has many .... and then of course there's
Erskine.

and Bob has many .... and then of course there's
Erskine.
What is the cause of the spirit of gloom that has
lately settled over the inhabitants of Encina Hall?
Why are there no more smiles on their faces, no more
long whistles at passers-by on the Engineering Corner.
Maybe it is because the Phillies are languishing in last
place in the National League, or because Breathless
Mahoney has eluded Dick Tracy once again.
But no, it is something deeper, something more im
portant than these^trivial things. Bill the Milkman is
here no more. Yes, Bill the Milkman, whose timely
articles on Encina Chow brought cheers from Army
men and civilians alike; whose words were like sweet
nothings in the ears of such men as the CE-s's. In the
long period of our acquaintance with him and his be
loved chow, we have grown to appreciate him as a
brother. But it had to come sometime and so instead of
shedding tears over his departure, let us rather hope
that he has joined the army again, for the twelfth
time and can again taste those rare delicacies that can
only be served up by a GI cook.

'Twas the night before furlough, and all thru Encina,
Not a creature was stirring, not even the O. D.
. . . . but it wasn't that way for long! The boys had
been to Rosatti's, and on their return decided to sing
a farewell dirge to their departing comrades. The walls
resounded to the strains of "Good Night Sweetheart,"
and "Auld Lang Syne." But crime does not pay,
especially at 2:30 AM, and so the MEs's got the blame
—but we are certain that it was Jackson, Ingram and
company. Anyway, the MEs's went on furlough, while
the latter group stayed behind.

For most of the lads here at Encina, the coming of
summer ended some very intimate affairs. But with
the aid of Simmons' Date Bureau, our lovers are back
in action, as anyone at the Reg Dance can testify.
All the boys seemed to enjoy themselves immensely;
it was difficult to determine who was having the best
time, but we could not avoid noticing our colleagues.
Lally, Reusch, and Getz cutting a very mean Rug.
Conspicuous in their absence were Walt Fleher and
his new acquaintance, that cute little Major. Good
work, old man, but fifty bucks a month (less 47) does
not go very far. Speaking oi' Majors, all the privates
out here welcomed as our new Batallion Commander,
Major Duckstad . . . all but Bill Helfand, who told the
Major in no uncertain TERMS, to "get the hell off
the grass." Oi' course it was a case of mistaken identity,
but it took some time to convince Major Duckstad.

Now that love has come to Nathan Pickles, the ro
mance department of the ME6's is complete. Norm has
his Jean, Bill has Amy, Vic has Peg, Kieth has Strass,
and Bob has many .... and then of course there's
Erskine.
