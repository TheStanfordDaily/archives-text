### CYCLONE COVEY 
MURDER. HE SAYS, now playing at the Stanford,
inadvertently commemorates the thirty-fifth anni
versary of its type of lowbrow slapstick movies.

It is set for the most part in a single
sordid hillbilly house, and deals for
the most part with characters who
are depraved. The object of both
setting and characters is: laughs.
But only Hollywood and Skunk
Creek will see anything funny in
sordidness and depraavity, though
it is true there are students at some
of our most exclusive Western col
leges from both places. And the
administrations, which are trying

to keep these colleges exclusive by raising prices every
year, are soon going to have no one able to enter
them except Hollywood movie moguls.
Still, Murder, He Says, has some luminescent dogs
Marjoric Main's horsewhip, Fred Mac Murray. and a
couple of lethal blondes named Bonnie. And you do
have to consider the blessing of a cool theater these
days.
* * *
THE UNSEEN, which also centers about a house,
but which is not constricted in being so centered, by
the stage techniques that confine Murder, He Says, is

a continuation of a string of mys
tery movies which has been Holly
wood's most acceptable achieve
ment so far this year. The Unseen
has not the ingenuity of Woman
in the Window, or the human com
mentary of Double Indemnity, or
the humor of Murder. My Sweet,
but it is skillful cinema and not
at all relaxing.

MR. EMMANUEL and THUNDER ROCK, the over
advertised British films which played at the Varsity
over the weekend, probably ought to come in for a
dig or two.
Both were plays on the screen. The British will
probably be even later than Hollywood in throwing
over a theatrical point of view in movie production.
No doubt the pernicious influence of Shakespeare.
Thunder Hock, by far the better of the two movies,
does not essentially diverge from the play, which, in
cidentally the Stanford Players presented in the Little
Theater, some years back. Insofar as the movie docs
diverge, it points up the background motivation of
the stage characters. And since this is done cine
matically, the picture is a compartmented half-and
half mixture of play and movie in its presentation.
But you have got to ><ive the British companies credit
lor their willingness to deal to some degree in social
and political ideas as well us in mere plots. Hollywood
is afraid to think.

administrations, which are trying

to keep these colleges exclusive by raising prices every
year, are soon going to have no one able to enter
them except Hollywood movie moguls.
Still, Murder, He Says, has some luminescent dogs
Marjoric Main's horsewhip, Fred Mac Murray. and a
couple of lethal blondes named Bonnie. And you do
have to consider the blessing of a cool theater these
days.

THE UNSEEN, which also centers about a house,
but which is not constricted in being so centered, by
the stage techniques that confine Murder, He Says, is

a continuation of a string of mys
tery movies which has been Holly
wood's most acceptable achieve
ment so far this year. The Unseen
has not the ingenuity of Woman
in the Window, or the human com
mentary of Double Indemnity, or
the humor of Murder. My Sweet,
but it is skillful cinema and not
at all relaxing.

MR. EMMANUEL and THUNDER ROCK, the over
advertised British films which played at the Varsity
over the weekend, probably ought to come in for a
dig or two.
Both were plays on the screen. The British will
probably be even later than Hollywood in throwing
over a theatrical point of view in movie production.
No doubt the pernicious influence of Shakespeare.
Thunder Hock, by far the better of the two movies,
does not essentially diverge from the play, which, in
cidentally the Stanford Players presented in the Little
Theater, some years back. Insofar as the movie docs
diverge, it points up the background motivation of
the stage characters. And since this is done cine
matically, the picture is a compartmented half-and
half mixture of play and movie in its presentation.
But you have got to ><ive the British companies credit
lor their willingness to deal to some degree in social
and political ideas as well us in mere plots. Hollywood
is afraid to think.


MURDER. HE SAYS, now playing at the Stanford,
inadvertently commemorates the thirty-fifth anni
versary of its type of lowbrow slapstick movies.

It is set for the most part in a single
sordid hillbilly house, and deals for
the most part with characters who
are depraved. The object of both
setting and characters is: laughs.
But only Hollywood and Skunk
Creek will see anything funny in
sordidness and depraavity, though
it is true there are students at some
of our most exclusive Western col
leges from both places. And the
administrations, which are trying

to keep these colleges exclusive by raising prices every
year, are soon going to have no one able to enter
them except Hollywood movie moguls.
