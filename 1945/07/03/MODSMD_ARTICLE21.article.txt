# Chilean Art In Bookstore
## 
### DOT ESCHERICH 
Chilean oil and water color paint
ings are being featured this week
in an exhibit in the book store. Tlvj
paintings, representing various Chil
ean artists, were collected by Lt. Roy
Malcolm, USNR, of the CATS, while
he was traveling in that country.
Most of the pictures are of rural
scenes, which strikingly resemble
many California landscapes, with tall
mountains and fertile plains. Par
ticularly interesting is one painting
by Gallardo, called "Quebradd
Erqui" or Ravine of the Dese;
which shows, as early historians
failed to mention, the rich growth
and rapid stream in a desert ravine
with cactus plants growing nearby.
Water Colors Shown
All the paintings which are now
displayed are oils, but tomorrow a
collection of water colors will be
shown. Among these is an interesting
series of cowboy and horse pictures
by Del Campo. He uses an unusual
ly heavy grained paper for his paint
ings. which coupled with his vivid
application of color, presents a lively
appearance.
Latin American Books
There will also be displayed num
erous rural sketches by Montenegro
and Neira, well-known Chilean
artists.
In conjunction with the exhibit of
paintings, the book store has a col
lection of books on Latin American
art on regular display.
