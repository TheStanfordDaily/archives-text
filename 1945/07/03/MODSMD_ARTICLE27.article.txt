# Farm Squad Enters League
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
A team of Stanford all-stars from
last quarter's intramural Softball
league has entered the Palo Alto
night softball tournament for the
second half of the season which be
gins on July 9. The ten will be
sponsored by Phelps-Terkel, who
will supply the uniforms for the
Stanford squad.
The prospects for a successful
season look very good considering
the fact the chucker for the team
will be Joe Sher, who was the
twirier for the championship Mon
roe "Boozei*" outfit last quarter.
Completely baffling his opponents
with his sensational riseball, Joe
averaged at least 12 or 13 strike
outs per game. How well he will
do in the realm of better compe
tition, time alone will tell, but we
think it will be pretty good.
Infield
The infield is composed of several
excellent players among whom are
included Dick Crane, an inconspicu
ous but consistent infielder, on first
base; Ric Supple, former Monroe
member, on second base; flawless
Bobby Rosburg, another member
of the Monroe "million dollar", in
field, at short patch; and Ted Mor
rison, more reknowned for his snap
py infielding in hardball last quar
-ter.
Games will be played two nights
a week, and the dates will in a
subsequent issue of the "Daily."
Stanford students are urged to at
'tend these contests and support
the boys.
Complete team roster and outfits
played for during spring quarter
are as follows:
Doc Mason, c .... Med School
Joe Sher, p Monroe
Dick Crane, lb Phi Psi's
Ric Supple, 2b Monroe
Ted Morrison, 3b Arguello
Bob Rosburg., ss Moonre
