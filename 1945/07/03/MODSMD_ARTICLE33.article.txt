# Brooklyn Dodgers Now Lead 4 Games Over St. Louis Cards
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
After glancing at the big time
baseball standings, the glancer finds
the beloved Flatbushers with an AA
priority in the senior circuit. This
is indeed a surprise to everyone, in
cluding the most rabid Brooklyn
fans. Durocher, even in his wildest
pipe dreams, probably never expect
ed to see his team where it is. Augie
Galan, the old Cubster, is playing
regularly, as well as Howie Schultz,
the elongated first baseman. At the
beginning of the season Manager Du
rocher said he would play at least
fifteen games this year, but his legs
failed to uphold their end of the
bargain, so Lippy is now a dugout
mentor.
The St. Louis Cards, without the
services of the Cooper brothers,
haven't been faring too well, al
though they are now in second
place. Kurowski, the hot sack handl
er, is hitting at a good pace, and
Marty Marion is proving to be the
he was. The othed veteran in
great shorstop his plaudits claimed
fielders are Sanders and Verban.
Buster Adams, always a dangerous
hitter, is the big outfield man. Blix
Donnelly and Ted Wilks are hold
overs from last year's pitching staff.
Giants In Third
The New York Giants, under the
managerial reins of Mel Ott, started
off with a flash, but now they are
in third place. Their early blaze of
glory was due mainly to Bill Voi
selle. Ernie Lombardi. Phil VVein

traub, and of course, Mel Ott. But
the first three are in the midst of
a slump and the club's fortunes are
waning also .
P. K. Wrigley's pride and joy. the
Chicago Cubs, are fourth-placers in
the league nowâ€”a high spot com
pared to recent performances. Stan
ley Hack is still abound, as well as
First Baseman Phil Cavarretta. Both
of these boys are very reliable, and
they manage to hold an otherwise
shaky infield together. Bill Nichol
son is back in the outfield, aa
when he catches his batting e"
the Cubs are liable to rise higher
yet.
Other Teams
Pittsburgh, Boston, and Cincinnati
are vieing it out for the next three
places. The Pirates, a potentially
powerful club, hasn't got that oomph,
it takes to be a winner. The Cin
cinnati lineup has been juggled
around a number of times, but the
right combo hasn't been hit yet. Bob
Coleman is the new manager of the
Boston club, but he isn't having any
more luck than Casey Stengal did.
War or no war, the Philadelphia
Phillies [ can always be trusted for
the depths of oblivion. The other
day Freddy Fitzsimmons gave up in
disgust as manager, and the new
victim is Ben Chapman. Good luck,
Benjamin.
