# Donors For Blood Bank Still Needed
## 
### 
Palo Alto has fallen 100 short of
its quota of 250 appointments for
Blood Bank day Thursday.
"Stanford agreed to furnish 30
pints of blood, but only about a
third of that number of persons have
made appointments,' 'stated Jean
Richards, Blood Bank chairman.
"We have, in the past, had a good
record for filling our quota, and I
hope the students won't let us down
this time," Miss Richards went on
to say.
The Palo Alto Red Cross has
asked that as many students as are
ab'.e will call for appointments,
either to Mrs. Robert Powers, Palo
i Alto 5834 or direct to Red Cross
headquarters, Palo Alto 22144.
The times which open are 11:20
and 1:15. If so requested, trans
portation will be furnished from
the Engineering corner to the Blood
Bank.
