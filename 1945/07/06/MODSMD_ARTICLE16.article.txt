MAY SMALL COLLEGES EXIST?
St. John's, the third oldest institution of high
er learning in the United States, is a small
college in Annapolis, lying within the shadow
of the Naval Academy. For years the Navy has
tried to absorb its campus and the fight is now
moving to the courts. For the entire St. John s
property the Navy Department has offered the
generous sum of $750,000. This amount is not
nearly sufficient to permit the college to move
to another campus. It would mean the end of
St. John's.
We do not deny that the officers trained in
the Naval Academy have performed splendidly
in this war. We doubt, however, Navy Secre
tary James Forrestal's statement that the ac
guisition of the St. John's site is "in the interest
of national security and national necessity.
The education offered by the liberal arts col
leges is as important to our country s welfare
as the training of officers, for the liberal arts
college educates men for peace. It trains the
businessmen, statesmen, doctors and lawyers
on whom we must depend in war as well as
in peace.
Little St. John's by itself may not seem very
important. As a test case it is highly significant.
It will determine whether governmental agen
cies can take over colleges at will. It is far
more than a question of property rights. It is
a question of whether we may continue to re
ceive the kind of education we choose, the kind
of education the founding fathers had, the kind
of education that has helped to make our coun
try great. —George Brunn
