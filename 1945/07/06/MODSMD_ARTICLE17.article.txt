TIIK CASE FOR SPANIELS
The influx of Spanish-spouting students and gradu
ates to the campus was bound to affect the regular
Turkish and English speaking population.
It was bound to. we said. Reg Day came and passed:
there was no major clash among the Tri-Linguals of
Lower Lasuen. But still we held to our guns—and aft
er all. $143 is the same in any tongue.
The "enemy" lost no time in pitching two camps.
One in Casa del Olivo, which they quickly renamed
into a literal translation of "A Case for Spaniels". From
this camp they commuted to the north by northeast
corner of the Lagunita Dining Rom for the main pur
pose of confusing the hasher as he makes his "Any Re
fiills" rounds.
For two weeks we have been Si-ing them in the long
line-up for siggies at the Cellar and in the equally long
line-up for unchlorinated water in the Women's Gym.
Until today, there has been this strain on the "Hello-
Hola" tradition. But a conversation overheard in the
Chintzy Room of the Women's Clubhouse has changed
our minds. The following parley has made us accept
th"se Spanish-spoutei's whole-heartedly into our Cafe
Cellar Society:
"Quantas anos has it been?"
"Diez"
"Veinte"
"Treinta"
"Quarenta"
"Un inferno of a long tiempo"
