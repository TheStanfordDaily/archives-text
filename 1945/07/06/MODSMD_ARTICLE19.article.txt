### CYCLONE COVEY 
BEING AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED
authority on aht over the past 40 odd years, particularly
at Winnipeg, I shall now pass comment on all the art,
mostly Latin American, which has been exhibited all
over the place this week. In a word it may be said that
people in Latin America evidently put in a lot of time
expressing themselves artistically. Maybe the several
dozen backward Latin Americans you see running loose
around the Co-op House are not representative of their
countries after all.

GRACE McCANN MORLgY. director of the San
Francisco Museum of Art, spoke an apology for con
temporary art on the Tuesday Series.
Though you are not supposed to respond to all of it,
there is something in it for everyone, she claimed. All
of us owe it to the artists of our time to try to under
stand them; they are not making fun of their public or
their art, but have something to say—she said. They
are not hard to understand; it is merely a matter of
looking with sensitiveness, from the artist's point of
view. And by thus gazing at contemporary art. you de
velop a pleasure which grows and carries over into ev
ery moment of your waking life. But this cultivation
of visual sensitivity, she continued, is something we
have largely forgotten in today's emphasis on the
printed page.
The great current of art of our time is international,
and according to Dr. Morley, contemporary artists are,
in an intimate and direct way expressing the culture
of our time. The majority of the public usually lag
about a generation behind the great artists of a given
period, because, she said, it takes most people about
that long to catch up with the extra sensitivity of art
ists to the times.
But before she commenced with a review of art
history in slides Dr. Morley unwittingly pronounced
the epitaph of much of modern art: "Art is good or
it is not art."
And there will remain those who would wish that
more contemporary Bohemians (Latin Americans ex
cluded) would quit giving vent to their neurotic im
pulses long enough to paint a pretty picture now and
then.

SPEAKING OF ART, there are a couple of elevated
movies showing now at the Stanford. One is about
horse-race-gamblers and the other about a burlesque

woman. They are artfully entitled,
Salty O'Rourke and Delightfully
Dangerous, respectively.
In the latter, the heroine starts
drooling onto her lips from the very
first shot in which she appears, but
manages to get all the way through
the picture without once having to
wipe her chin.
In the former Alan Ladd, who
also licks his lips in the glamor-girl
fashion, plays the usual no-account
egotist that women go for. And all

in all we may "say it has been a great week for art.
