# Spanish Dancer Brings New Versions to Memorial Hall
## 
### 
The first performance in the United States of a new version of the
Mate Amargo, traditional Uruguayan dance, will be given by Miss Dolores
van Patten at 8 tonight in the Memorial Auditorium. The performance is
open to the public without charge in connection with the Latin American
workshop.
The Mate Amargo or Ranchcra is customarily danced by a group, but

this solo arrangement where the
steps of the man and the woman
are combined was brought to this
country by Elisa Cansino, formerly
Miss van Patten's teacher, who re
cently returned from a South Am
erican tour. In the new version the
soft movements represent those of
the woman and the more vigorous
stamps and heel work belong to the
man.
Dances of the Peruvian Indian
show the subtle monotony of the
Indians dancing in religious pag
eants which continues for days with
out rest. This particular dance is
one of thanksgiving for a good harv
esct and tells the story of working
the soil, sowing the seed, and harv
esting the grain. The devout and
modest demeanor of . the danser
show the faith and devotion of the
Incas.

Another of the dances, O Facto,
is the subject of an interesting
discussion as to its origin, since it
is found both in Brazil and Portu
gal. The popular belief is that it
originated, in Portugal and was
brought to Brazil where it became
one of the most popular dances
at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. Some people think, how
ever, that the dance was started
in Brazil and from there spread
to the mother country, Portugal.
There is little evidence to support
this, because there is 110 original
Brazilian fado music.
The last dance on the program,
La de Alcaniz or ota, is traditionally
Spanish, although it is performed
by dancers throughout Latin Am
erica. Miss van Patten's presenta
tion is not intended to be authentic,
but instead is an attempt to give an
impression of the day and humor
ous spirit which characterizes most
folk music. The dancer, a rather
awkward peasant girl, is looking
for a partner with little success,
but does not let this dampen her
spirits and finishes the dance with
enthusiasm.
Among the other dances are a
Cuban rumba and the Mexican na
tional dance.
John Mailing, pianist, will play
several solo selections as well as
accompany Miss van Patten's danc
ing.
