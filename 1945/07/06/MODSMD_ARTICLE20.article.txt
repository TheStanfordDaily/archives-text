### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
(VETO QUESTION CONTINUED)
The subcommittee drafted a questionnaire that was
to be sent to the sponsors and France, and it asked for a
detailed stand on the problem. The "Big Five" framed
a joint answer, and the general run of it was that any
peaceful settlement of a dispute might start a chain of
circumstances that could lead to the necessity for force
ful sanctions. Since the main powers would have to
contribute the main force, any one of them should have
the right to check the pressures leading to its use at the
beginning.
The small nations replied that, far from causing se
rious difficulties, the majority settlement of a dispute
could stop them. One major power could leave a se
rious set of difficulties unsettled as things stand now.
That would be the same as leaving a festering sore un
doctored. Maybe, however, the disputant parties would
go to tribunals outside the United Nations, but this
would weaken the organization, they claimed.
The question was still deadlocked, so now the Big
Five got nasty. They declared that either they got the
veto power, or else they walked out. It was as blunt
as all that.
VOTE
A vote was taken, and only two states opposed the
veto. But enough delegations to kill the whole idea
abstained. Each chief-of-delegation who did so sent in
a written explanation of his actions, and several spoke
before the open commission meeting.
Although the veto might bring about quite a bit of
red tape, the tactics that put it through were hardly
laudible—it is still an indication of the shape of the
world today, and shows that the conference had its feet
on the ground.
However the smaller-nations delegates demanded a
new session to redraft the charter ten years from now —
a sort of arnnding session.
