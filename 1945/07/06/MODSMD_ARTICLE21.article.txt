One question that is deep in the
mind of every ardent sports fan is, ;
will professional baseball players j
who have gone into the service j
be able to make successful come- I
backs?
There are various outlooks and
answers to this important ques
tion. Perhaps the most worth
while answer to it has been pre
ferred by Connie Mack of the ;
Philadelphia Athletics. Connie,
who has been a manager for over
fifty years has seen many great
players come and go. He says !
that there is a certain somethin'
similar to the elasticity in a rub- I
her band that a baseball top- ;
notcher must have, and when they
enter the service and get out of
the harness, they lose this flexi
bility in most instances.
This fact might be true, but we
must consider in addition to this,
the increased age of the players,
something which really begins to
tell when they get past thirty, and,
yes, the lack of the spirit of compe
tition. Many prospectively great
ball players have been weeded out
in training camps because of their
lack of aggressiveness. For an il
lustration of the age factor let us
keep our eye on "Red" Ruffing,
former top New York Yankee pitch
er, who has recently returned to
Yankee togs. "Red" is 40 years old
and should be an apt indication of
what happens when a fellow gets
beyond his prime.
Hank Greenberg is one former
major leaguer that everybody is
watching with open eyes. Hank
is the one who smacked out 58
home runs during the year before
he went into the service. Hank
still seems to have some of that
"elasticity" for he justified the De
troit Tigers 55.000 dollar faith in
his ability by swatting out two
home runs for the first two hits
he has gotten since his return to
comptition.
As for the rest of the fellows that
are in the service such as:2 Joe Di
Maggio and Charlie Keller of the
Yankee "murderers row" and Ted
Williams, who batted .406 for the
Boston Red Sox the year before he
entered the navy, time alone will
tell whether they will make suc
cessful returns. It must be remem
bered that many of these profes
sionals are still playing ball while
they are in the service—Bob Fel

ler and Walker Cooper at Great
Lakes, Dick Bartell at Treasure Is
land Naval Base, and Stan Musial
at Fleet City.
My theory is that major league
baseball is slowly degenerating:
and will continue to do so until
new crops of rookies again begin
to seep into tbe big leagues. This
will take several years to happen
and whatever slight decrease in
ability the old-timers may have
suffered will be compensated for by
this lack of talent.

former top New York Yankee pitch
er, who has recently returned to
Yankee togs. "Red" is 40 years old
and should be an apt indication of
what happens when a fellow gets
beyond his prime.
Hank Greenberg is one former
major leaguer that everybody is
watching with open eyes. Hank
is the one who smacked out 58
home runs during the year before
he went into the service. Hank
still seems to have some of that
"elasticity" for he justified the De
troit Tigers 55.000 dollar faith in
his ability by swatting out two
home runs for the first two hits
he has gotten since his return to
comptition.
As for the rest of the fellows that
are in the service such as:2 Joe Di
Maggio and Charlie Keller of the
Yankee "murderers row" and Ted
Williams, who batted .406 for the
Boston Red Sox the year before he
entered the navy, time alone will
tell whether they will make suc
cessful returns. It must be remem
bered that many of these profes
sionals are still playing ball while
they are in the service—Bob Fel

ler and Walker Cooper at Great
Lakes, Dick Bartell at Treasure Is
land Naval Base, and Stan Musial
at Fleet City.
My theory is that major league
baseball is slowly degenerating:
and will continue to do so until
new crops of rookies again begin
to seep into tbe big leagues. This
will take several years to happen
and whatever slight decrease in
ability the old-timers may have
suffered will be compensated for by
this lack of talent.
One question that is deep in the
mind of every ardent sports fan is, ;
will professional baseball players j
who have gone into the service j
be able to make successful come- I
backs?
There are various outlooks and
answers to this important ques
tion. Perhaps the most worth
while answer to it has been pre
ferred by Connie Mack of the ;
Philadelphia Athletics. Connie,
who has been a manager for over
fifty years has seen many great
players come and go. He says !
that there is a certain somethin'
similar to the elasticity in a rub- I
her band that a baseball top- ;
notcher must have, and when they
enter the service and get out of
the harness, they lose this flexi
bility in most instances.
This fact might be true, but we
must consider in addition to this,
the increased age of the players,
something which really begins to
tell when they get past thirty, and,
yes, the lack of the spirit of compe
tition. Many prospectively great
ball players have been weeded out
in training camps because of their
lack of aggressiveness. For an il
lustration of the age factor let us
keep our eye on "Red" Ruffing,
former top New York Yankee pitch
er, who has recently returned to
Yankee togs. "Red" is 40 years old
and should be an apt indication of
what happens when a fellow gets
beyond his prime.
