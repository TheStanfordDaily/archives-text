Continuing on our telescopic sports
lide. we find the American League
ambling along at a merry pace.
None other than the boys from the
world's car capital are leaders in
the race. The Tigers really look like
pennant winners now, with Hank
Greenberg back in the lineup. He is
one of the outstanding players of
the century, and aided by such hard
hitting veterans as Rudy York. Doc
Cramer, and Eddie Mayo; and starl
ing pitching by Newhouser, Trout,
and Benton, the Detroiters can hard
ly fail to win the pennant.
Ihe Saint Louis Browns last
year's champs, are now miserably
lost in sixth place. Practically ail
of last year's players are hack, but
if they've still got what it takes
to win, they must have left it
somewhere. Pete Gray has been
playing fairly often, hut most ev
eryone :s agreed—and very sadly,
too—that Pete isn't of real major
league caliber. He's a perfect hunt
dragger. but the split second that
is lost when he catches a ball, and
his failure to hit hard might prove
his final undoing in the majors.
The New York Yankees are all
dressed up with new owners this
year. Leland Stanford MacPhail. a
name worthy of any man's praise, is
the new financial boss of the club.
Whether its colorful antics will in
terfere with Joe McCarthy's staid
tactics is idle rumor, but most
"smartsters" says that MacPhail is
too smart a baseball man to run
afoul with Uncle Joe, reputedly the
best manager in the business. Al
though all of the heavy swatters
have heeded eLwis B. Hershey's "ad
vice. the club still possesses a re
semblance to the team of old. StufTv
Stirnweiss, But Metheny, and Nick
Etten often hit the pellet—but hard.
The remarkable Washington Sen
ators have entrenched themselves in
third place. Marion Pieretti. the
pint-sized pitcher from Portland, is
vinning his share of games, and
timely hitting by Case. Myatt. and

t
i Vaughn has put the club where
it is.
In the fourth slot are Tom Yawk
| ey's Red Sox. Their usual trouble
is lack of pitchers, but this year
| there is a lack of hitters and pitchers,
I with the exception of phenomenal
; Dave Ferriss, the boy with thirteen
j victories already.
The White Sox started strong, but
! they lost that early "wheaties
| strength," and are now in fifth place.
I Cleveland and Philadelphia are the
j two "bottomers," with the Connie
Mack outfit leading the race for last
j place.
