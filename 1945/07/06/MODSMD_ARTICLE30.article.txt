# Farm Not Privately Endowed, Says Davis
## 
### BOB PECK 
"Stanford's past has been illus
trious,'" Mr. Paul Davis, general sec
retary of the University says, "but
I envision an even greater future
for this University which is playing
such an important and vital role in
American higher education."
Originally Stanford was begun as
the world's richest university with
a lavish endowment from the found
ers and for the first 25 years prac
tically no gifts were made to Stan
ford except by the Stanfords them
selves. Now, Mr. Davis reveals, over
80 per cent of Stanford's gift money
is donations from the general public
in behalf of independent education.
Privately Endowed
The term privately endowed uni
versity is a term Mr. Davis em
phatically dislikes. "Privately en
dowed is a damaging, strangely dis
torted term for the one thousand
independent, gift-supported colleges
and universities that faithfully and
effectively serve America," Mr.
Davis says. "To the casual public
the name privately endowed smacks
of smugness, special privileges, en
trenched wealth, and locked mas
sive iroji gates, all far removed from
the vigorously competitive whirl of
the stream of life."
To a man whose job it is to sell
Stanford to the outside public it is
obvious why Mr. Davis prefers a
term such as independent, gift-sup
ported university to privately en
dowed.
The age old question of where
the difference lies between gift
supported universities and state
universities is not a new one to Mr.
Davis. "The distinguishing features
of the two types of universities are

the source of major external financ
ial support and the degree of inde
pendence from political or govern
mental control.
In relation to the latter of the two
differences it is wise to recall the
furor created recently by state in
tervention in the running of Louisi
ana State U. and the University of
Georgia. When Mr. Davis laments
the headaches of running a school
largely on gifts, he at such
cases as these and is given added
impetus to start working on another
sales talk to preach the Stanford
story to the public.
The "Stanford Story"
"Stanford will have to find its
support from the people," Mr. Davis
believes. Governmental analysis of
the 1942 income tax returns dis
closed that over 80 per cent of all
gifts made during the year was
from persons who reported incomes
of under $5,000 a year.
"Gone are the days when we will
be able to rely solely on large gifts
from multimillionaires because there
just aren't many of them left." Mr.
Davis emphatically said. "Instead it
is my job to tell the public, the
people who are interested in this
type of education, about Stanford
and what kind of work we are do
ing here."
Ail-Time Gift High
If the fact that Stanford has al
ready this year received over $2,-
500.000 in gifts, far over the prev
ious all-time high set in 1942, it
would seem Mr. Davis does a good
job of telling the Stanford story.
"Most students don't realize," Mr.
Davis said, "that their tuition covers
only about half of the cost of their
education. The other fifty percent
comes from public sources and will
have to continue to do so."
Every building on the campus,
other than the buildings built by the
Stanfords, was the gift of some per
son or group. Recent additions to
the campus have been the Cubberly
Library, Memorial Auditorium, and
the Hoover War Library. Incidental
ly the students themselves were the
donors of Memorial Hall. They are
still paying for it. along with a grant
from the Carnegie Institute funds,
from our student body funds.
It should be also stressed that
much of the work is telling the
Stanford story to the public is done
by the Stanford Associates, a group
of alumni and friends interested in
the cause of independent education.

trious,'" Mr. Paul Davis, general sec

Originally Stanford was begun as
the world's richest university with
a lavish endowment from the found
ers and for the first 25 years prac
tically no gifts were made to Stan
ford except by the Stanfords them
selves. Now, Mr. Davis reveals, over
80 per cent of Stanford's gift money
is donations from the general public
in behalf of independent education.
Privately Endowed
The term privately endowed uni
versity is a term Mr. Davis em
phatically dislikes. "Privately en
dowed is a damaging, strangely dis
torted term for the one thousand
independent, gift-supported colleges
and universities that faithfully and
effectively serve America," Mr.
Davis says. "To the casual public
the name privately endowed smacks
of smugness, special privileges, en
trenched wealth, and locked mas
sive iroji gates, all far removed from
the vigorously competitive whirl of
the stream of life."
To a man whose job it is to sell
Stanford to the outside public it is
obvious why Mr. Davis prefers a
term such as independent, gift-sup
ported university to privately en
dowed.
The age old question of where
the difference lies between gift
supported universities and state
universities is not a new one to Mr.
Davis. "The distinguishing features
of the two types of universities are

the source of major external financ
ial support and the degree of inde
pendence from political or govern
mental control.
In relation to the latter of the two
differences it is wise to recall the
furor created recently by state in
tervention in the running of Louisi
ana State U. and the University of
Georgia. When Mr. Davis laments
the headaches of running a school
largely on gifts, he at such
cases as these and is given added
impetus to start working on another
sales talk to preach the Stanford
story to the public.
The "Stanford Story"
"Stanford will have to find its
support from the people," Mr. Davis
believes. Governmental analysis of
the 1942 income tax returns dis
closed that over 80 per cent of all
gifts made during the year was
from persons who reported incomes
of under $5,000 a year.
"Gone are the days when we will
be able to rely solely on large gifts
from multimillionaires because there
just aren't many of them left." Mr.
Davis emphatically said. "Instead it
is my job to tell the public, the
people who are interested in this
type of education, about Stanford
and what kind of work we are do
ing here."
Ail-Time Gift High
If the fact that Stanford has al
ready this year received over $2,-
500.000 in gifts, far over the prev
ious all-time high set in 1942, it
would seem Mr. Davis does a good
job of telling the Stanford story.
"Most students don't realize," Mr.
Davis said, "that their tuition covers
only about half of the cost of their
education. The other fifty percent
comes from public sources and will
have to continue to do so."
Every building on the campus,
other than the buildings built by the
Stanfords, was the gift of some per
son or group. Recent additions to
the campus have been the Cubberly
Library, Memorial Auditorium, and
the Hoover War Library. Incidental
ly the students themselves were the
donors of Memorial Hall. They are
still paying for it. along with a grant
from the Carnegie Institute funds,
from our student body funds.
It should be also stressed that
much of the work is telling the
Stanford story to the public is done
by the Stanford Associates, a group
of alumni and friends interested in
the cause of independent education.
"Stanford's past has been illus
trious,'" Mr. Paul Davis, general sec
retary of the University says, "but
I envision an even greater future
for this University which is playing
such an important and vital role in
American higher education."
