experience in debates this summer
so as to have more veteran material

According to the tentative debat
ing schedule, meets will be held on
topics of current interest with near

Junior College.
Additional plans for debates and
open forum discussions will be made

valuable for the student planning to
take debating for credit next fall."
said Mr. Biscay.
Refreshments will be served at the
Open House by members of Delta

nity.
