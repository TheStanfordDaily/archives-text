# Farm Professor Helps Dibble Blind
## 
### 
Professor Waldemar Johansen, aft
and technical director of dramatics
at Stanford since 1937 and now on
leave from the university, together
with Robert Dodd, occupational
therapist, is devising new ways
giving blinded veterans at Dibble
General Hospital an understanding
of the everyday things which sighted
individuals take for granted.
4pbe "Workshop," as Professor
Johansen calls it, is a part of Dib
ble's comprehensive reconditioning
program for its war-blinded pa
tients.
Professor Johansen is now setting
up a number of projects in the re
cently completed hospital wing for
the blind. One of them is a home
repair shop where the patients learn
to fix faucets, electrical appliances,
door locks, and to solve other house
hold difficulties.
Other projects include the funda
mental occupational therapy activi
ties, such as leather work and string
typing, and a radio class in which
the patients are given an under
standing of elementary radio me
chanics.
