## From the Other Shack on Campus 
### 
Tonight at 7:30 a group of freshmen will tour
a little green shack—most of them for the first
time. The others, whose curiosity and interest
needed no invitation, will not bother to re-read
the picture-writing on the walls or to re-lose a
nickel in the coke machine.
This group will visit the shack not because it
was included in their post-reg tour of the cam
pus, but because they suspected that there was
more to Stanford life than what could be seen
from the Civ Libe windows.
In this shack they will see a cross-section of
the campus —a few veterans of World War 11,
a Phi Bete, a transfer, an Easterner, etc. They
will hear from this cross-section its usual ex
change of ideas—some workable, some not.
We hope that in the smoky atmosphere of the
Daily Shack, these tryoutees will find that half
competitive, half-co-operative spirit of the Farm.
They're welcome to look.
