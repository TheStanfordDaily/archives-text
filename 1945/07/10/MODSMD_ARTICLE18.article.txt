# AN INVITATION
## 
### 
Much talk is heard these days about international
relations. Some of us take courses offered by Stanford
on this subject. Almost all of us repeat what we read
in publications or hear over the radio concerning the
necessity for bettering international relations and fur
thering our friendships with our foreign neighbors.
All of this, we seem to feel, is far removed from us.
We feel that there isn't much that we as individuals
can do. Yet here in our own community is an oppor
tunity for vis to have first hand contact with this sub
ject.
There are students here from many different for
eign countries. How well do we know them? How
well do we know what they had to go through in order
to come here? Do we know very much about their
native land? How do we look through the eyes of a
young man who has left his home in Afghanistan to
travel half way around the world to study at this
university? How do we seem to the Chinese boy who
endured the almost unimpeded Japanese bombings in
China and the long flight "over the hump" and then
the long sea voyage from India to America so that he
might study at Stanford? We could go on at length
naming all the other countries which have represen
tatives here, but the general idea is the same.
Remember what the late Wendell Willkie said about
this being one world? Let's not just shrug our shoul
ders and say that it doesn't make any difference to
us what people are like in foreign lands. We must
get to know each other. Those countries once so re
mote are our neighbors now. Remember the Air Line
advertisements—No spot on earth is more than sixty
hours from your local airport.
Thursday afternoon the Chinese Club will welcome
the campus to a tea given on the lawn in front of
their clubhouse. Guest of honor for the occasion is the
honorable C. T. Feng, Chinese Consul General at San
Francisco. Extending traditionally warm hospitality
they welcome us and await our friendship. Let us ac
cept them wholeheartedly and unreservedly, and show
them by our appreciative attendance that we want to
know and understand our foreign neighbors better and
create friendships.—B. S.
