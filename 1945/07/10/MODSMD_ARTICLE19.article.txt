### VIC BILL 
The endless line was moving slowly onward. Their
faces white in terrifying anticipation, their eyes star
ing bleakly ahead, their wrinkled brows heavy with
beads of perspiration, they realized that this was it.
Would they survive the ordeal, would they live to tell
others of their experience, or would they falter as had
many of their comrades before them. Aid men were
carrying out those who had succumbed; smiling lieu
tenants stood by, ther whips lashing thru the air un
mercifully. The men clanched their teeth as shrieks

of agony broke the awful silence. Many of the younger
ones could be observed in silent prayer; only a scant
few advanced with heads held high. The moment was
approaching, the line had reached the last room at the
end of the darkened hall. Suddenly a high pitched
voice cried out, "All right you men, let's get these darn
shots over with" ....
Yes, they have arrived. Once again the somber
halls of Sncina are enlivened by the pitter patter of
tiny feet. The new E R C's are here, their baby pink
faces beaming at the prospects of the glories of mili
tary lfe. But they will soon get over it; after all the
first ten years in the army are the hardest. We old
timers with 9 discharge points know. However, we
welcomed them with opened arms, a broom in one
hand and a mop n the other . . .
The army dance last Friday night was a huge suc
cess( as army dances inevitably are. Seen at the af
fair were Colonel and Mrs, Eden enjoying themselves
immensely. Others noted were: Meemi, Baumester,
Meemi, Herman, Meemi, Claude, Meemi, and of course
Meemi. ... A notable feature was the overabundance
of men and E R C's, such an event has not happened
since ... It is bound to have repercussions on campus.
So women of Lagunita and Roble take heed! We ex
pect to see you all at the dance next week. Remem
ber, with girls who know, it's army men 2 to 1.
And next week we have something more to offer.
Under new management, and with the spectacular
leadership of Walt Fleher, former Stan Kenton and
Sully Mason 88'er the Army Swing Band will make its
debut. The band features such men as that Goodman
disciple, Bob Drasnin. who will take you to another
planet with his mellow clarnet, and Koith Sheppard,
a Dorsey protege, who blue stars on Trombone. So
dance without a care to the music of Walt Fleher,
next Friday night.
Attention!!! Excellent opportunity for single unmar
ried woman, in possession of good looks, ravishing
figure; sensational personality, and late model Cadillac
convertable .... or anything with four wheels and
a motor. She must have excellent references, as only
such persons will be considered for the position. Will
such person contact '"AST ECHOES" at the Daily
shack as soon as possible. . . .

end of the darkened hall. Suddenly a high pitched
voice cried out, "All right you men, let's get these darn
shots over with" ....
Yes, they have arrived. Once again the somber
halls of Sncina are enlivened by the pitter patter of
tiny feet. The new E R C's are here, their baby pink
faces beaming at the prospects of the glories of mili
tary lfe. But they will soon get over it; after all the
first ten years in the army are the hardest. We old
timers with 9 discharge points know. However, we
welcomed them with opened arms, a broom in one
hand and a mop n the other . . .
The army dance last Friday night was a huge suc
cess( as army dances inevitably are. Seen at the af
fair were Colonel and Mrs, Eden enjoying themselves
immensely. Others noted were: Meemi, Baumester,
Meemi, Herman, Meemi, Claude, Meemi, and of course
Meemi. ... A notable feature was the overabundance
of men and E R C's, such an event has not happened
since ... It is bound to have repercussions on campus.
So women of Lagunita and Roble take heed! We ex
pect to see you all at the dance next week. Remem
ber, with girls who know, it's army men 2 to 1.
And next week we have something more to offer.
Under new management, and with the spectacular
leadership of Walt Fleher, former Stan Kenton and
Sully Mason 88'er the Army Swing Band will make its
debut. The band features such men as that Goodman
disciple, Bob Drasnin. who will take you to another
planet with his mellow clarnet, and Koith Sheppard,
a Dorsey protege, who blue stars on Trombone. So
dance without a care to the music of Walt Fleher,
next Friday night.
Attention!!! Excellent opportunity for single unmar
ried woman, in possession of good looks, ravishing
figure; sensational personality, and late model Cadillac
convertable .... or anything with four wheels and
a motor. She must have excellent references, as only
such persons will be considered for the position. Will
such person contact '"AST ECHOES" at the Daily
shack as soon as possible. . . .
The endless line was moving slowly onward. Their
faces white in terrifying anticipation, their eyes star
ing bleakly ahead, their wrinkled brows heavy with
beads of perspiration, they realized that this was it.
Would they survive the ordeal, would they live to tell
others of their experience, or would they falter as had
many of their comrades before them. Aid men were
carrying out those who had succumbed; smiling lieu
tenants stood by, ther whips lashing thru the air un
mercifully. The men clanched their teeth as shrieks

of agony broke the awful silence. Many of the younger
ones could be observed in silent prayer; only a scant
few advanced with heads held high. The moment was
approaching, the line had reached the last room at the
end of the darkened hall. Suddenly a high pitched
voice cried out, "All right you men, let's get these darn
shots over with" ....
