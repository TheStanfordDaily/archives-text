### CYCLONE COVEY 
VALLEY OF DECISION, now playing at the Stan
ford, is a major Hollywood effort that multitudes are
going to weep through.

Were it not that Hollywood is
equipped for a much larger exer
tion, and the multitudes with a
much greater grief potential, one's
reproaches ought perhaps be soft.
Valley of Decision is tried and
true, every single line, expression,
character, situation, embrace, tan
trum of it. The background music
we have heard a million times be
fore, and the photographic tech
nique was out of date with The
Barretts of Winipole Street.

The pace of the picture is exhaustijigly slow; a D
grade Western is more skillfully cut.
The hues are all darkened. Hollywood still thinks
that to be dingy is to be effective.
Talk, talk, talk. When will Hollywood make a mo
tion picture whch tells its story in visual movement
instead of in 40,000 spoken words?
The usual typed characters. The heroine, who is
i nothing but pure gold. The villainess, who is nothing
! but repulsive. The hero, who is certain of being canon
ized. The father (Lionel Barrymore) who can do noth
ing but fly into a rage.
Greer Garson. She must surely be a marvelous, if
affected, woman. But she has given us nothing new
since her first picture.
And she is obviously too old for Gregory Peck.
And a ten-year lapse, as that which occurs toward
the end, would reasonably produce some ageing in
somebody.
The violent death of two principals in a single se
quence ought to have slightly more dramatic impact
than a brief flurry of noise.
But what is strangest of all is that in a movie the
lovers still do not marry bcause they cannot forget
one incident but in the end all is well because they can
easily forget ten years of marriage to the wrong girl.
Valley of Dccison (an inappropriate title, by the
I way) draws heavily from a number of by-gone pro
ductions, flow Green Was My Valley, for instance;
I but it neglects to crib their poetry as well, or their
I subtle exploration of individual personality, or their
j subsurface revelation of another period and place
i (Valley of IK'cison is set in early Pittsburgh, though
it may as well have been Calcutta for all the difference
made.)
In the gloomy big-house scenes, the producers might
have profited from the technical handling of The
Magnificent Ambersons. But no, you will not catch
the camera itself moving through a room, or any
such good cinematic exploitation. Everybody saw
The Magnificent Ambersons but Hollywood.
You may be impressed by this trite picture. But it
; is still n trite picture.
THE OTHER FEATURE, something about adam's
1 apples, is a re-working of It Happened One Night.

made.)
In the gloomy big-house scenes, the producers might
have profited from the technical handling of The
Magnificent Ambersons. But no, you will not catch
the camera itself moving through a room, or any
such good cinematic exploitation. Everybody saw
The Magnificent Ambersons but Hollywood.
You may be impressed by this trite picture. But it
; is still n trite picture.
THE OTHER FEATURE, something about adam's
1 apples, is a re-working of It Happened One Night.

VALLEY OF DECISION, now playing at the Stan
ford, is a major Hollywood effort that multitudes are
going to weep through.

Were it not that Hollywood is
equipped for a much larger exer
tion, and the multitudes with a
much greater grief potential, one's
reproaches ought perhaps be soft.
Valley of Decision is tried and
true, every single line, expression,
character, situation, embrace, tan
trum of it. The background music
we have heard a million times be
fore, and the photographic tech
nique was out of date with The
Barretts of Winipole Street.

The pace of the picture is exhaustijigly slow; a D
grade Western is more skillfully cut.
The hues are all darkened. Hollywood still thinks
that to be dingy is to be effective.
Talk, talk, talk. When will Hollywood make a mo
tion picture whch tells its story in visual movement
instead of in 40,000 spoken words?
The usual typed characters. The heroine, who is
i nothing but pure gold. The villainess, who is nothing
! but repulsive. The hero, who is certain of being canon
ized. The father (Lionel Barrymore) who can do noth
ing but fly into a rage.
Greer Garson. She must surely be a marvelous, if
affected, woman. But she has given us nothing new
since her first picture.
And she is obviously too old for Gregory Peck.
And a ten-year lapse, as that which occurs toward
the end, would reasonably produce some ageing in
somebody.
The violent death of two principals in a single se
quence ought to have slightly more dramatic impact
than a brief flurry of noise.
But what is strangest of all is that in a movie the
lovers still do not marry bcause they cannot forget
one incident but in the end all is well because they can
easily forget ten years of marriage to the wrong girl.
