# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To The Editor:
One C. Davis Covey (he insists on
calling himself Cyclone) has been
confined to the pain-collecting task
of critic in your Bi-weekly Daily.
Sell-evident demonstration of
campus manpower shortage, we'll
say.
Said Covey can't forget he once
was the Stanford compulsory paper
"Bullsessioner" and draws back to
it at the least provocation. Thus his
column of last Friday. There he
makes a clever comparison among
Alan Ladd, Dr. Morley, and our
amok, Co-op-running, Latin back
wardness. An interesting theme and
a most audacious approache. He
shows quite a polyvalence of values
and also uses up about a third of
your exquisitely-written, mum-leav
ing editorial page.
Meantime, Mexico's Yucatan
movies and Dolores Van Patten pre
sentation filled the Cubberly Audi
torium and the Memorial Theater
respectively, to capacity. Not to
mention things to come, as the Fi
esta to be presented on July 27 un
der the combined, alert leadership
of Romanic Languages Department's
Dr. Rael, Mexico's No. 1 fish length
and-breadth recorder Rene Nunez,
and Casa Espanola's Lois I'm-going
to-Chile Griffitts. (Exuberant Lag
unita's prexy is also going.)
"Columnist" Covey had better
stop his pH 2-like observations or
we'll simply quit taking him to
Wilson's for breakfast on Sunday
mornings, as we've been doing for
the past three odd years. And, for
week-day breakfasts, we'll summar
ily instruct our detachment in the
Strauss-disciplined Cellar platoon to
ignore him at random.
The backward Latins of the
Co-op and other Latins.

To The Editor:
The following is a self-descriptive
statement of what happened to a
tentative meeting that was to be
held near the end of last quarter.
1,000 copies of a circular similar
to what follows were distributed,
but it was too close to finals to ac
complish anything. I hope that the
students, even the new ones, will
make the small effort to do some
thing about this. We can all do
something about it if each of us
drops a note on the A.S.S.U. desk
above the cellar in the Union.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AT STANFORD?
Public Exercises Committee last
week handed down a decision sig
nificant for its arbitrary silencing
of discussion on a subject which
concerns every student and faculty
member: post-war conscription. An
open meeting designed to present
the case against conscription was
planned by a group of interested
students. Discussion and presenta
tion of opinion either pro or con
on such an important subject cannot
be prohibited without opening the
whole question of freedom to as
semble and to discuss any issue that
matters to even one or two indi
viduals.
If. after reading the following
facts, you agree that the Public
Exercises Committe has abused its
power: if yovi see in this a definite
contradiction of what Stanford
means: if you want to lend your
support to an effort to prevent fu
ture arbitrary prohibitions, we urge
you to contact any one of the un
dersigned. excom. or Bob Kennedy,
A.S.S.U. president.
This is what happened:
May 28. Application made to Ex
Com for permission to hold a pro
test meeting re: Peacetime Con
scription.
May 2C. Sect'y of Public Exercises
Committee reserved auditorium for
proposed meeting. Said final approv
al would follow decision of Ex
Com.
May 10. Ex Com approved meet
ing "or Monday. Tune 4.
June 1. Story of meeting carried
in Daily. Notices posted in living
groups.
Same day. Chairman of Public
Exercises Committee, Dr. Heffner,
objected to meeting. Reason: one
sidednoss. This objection was re
tracted after conference with mem

ber of the sponsorng group and new
objection was raised: "Dead Week."
(incidentally an Ex Com ruling)
Public Exercises Committee ihen
formally vetoed the meeting as be
ing a proposed "social function"
slated for "dead week." (which,
however, did not affect the Prom).
What about an authority from
which there is no appeal—an au
thority which says: YOU CAN'T
HOLD A MEETING!
Is that O. K. by you?

FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AT STANFORD?
Public Exercises Committee last
week handed down a decision sig
nificant for its arbitrary silencing
of discussion on a subject which
concerns every student and faculty
member: post-war conscription. An
open meeting designed to present
the case against conscription was
planned by a group of interested
students. Discussion and presenta
tion of opinion either pro or con
on such an important subject cannot
be prohibited without opening the
whole question of freedom to as
semble and to discuss any issue that
matters to even one or two indi
viduals.
If. after reading the following
facts, you agree that the Public
Exercises Committe has abused its
power: if yovi see in this a definite
contradiction of what Stanford
means: if you want to lend your
support to an effort to prevent fu
ture arbitrary prohibitions, we urge
you to contact any one of the un
dersigned. excom. or Bob Kennedy,
A.S.S.U. president.
This is what happened:
May 28. Application made to Ex
Com for permission to hold a pro
test meeting re: Peacetime Con
scription.
May 2C. Sect'y of Public Exercises
Committee reserved auditorium for
proposed meeting. Said final approv
al would follow decision of Ex
Com.
May 10. Ex Com approved meet
ing "or Monday. Tune 4.
June 1. Story of meeting carried
in Daily. Notices posted in living
groups.
Same day. Chairman of Public
Exercises Committee, Dr. Heffner,
objected to meeting. Reason: one
sidednoss. This objection was re
tracted after conference with mem

ber of the sponsorng group and new
objection was raised: "Dead Week."
(incidentally an Ex Com ruling)
Public Exercises Committee ihen
formally vetoed the meeting as be
ing a proposed "social function"
slated for "dead week." (which,
however, did not affect the Prom).
What about an authority from
which there is no appeal—an au
thority which says: YOU CAN'T
HOLD A MEETING!

To The Editor:
One C. Davis Covey (he insists on
calling himself Cyclone) has been
confined to the pain-collecting task
of critic in your Bi-weekly Daily.
Sell-evident demonstration of
campus manpower shortage, we'll
say.
Said Covey can't forget he once
was the Stanford compulsory paper
"Bullsessioner" and draws back to
it at the least provocation. Thus his
column of last Friday. There he
makes a clever comparison among
Alan Ladd, Dr. Morley, and our
amok, Co-op-running, Latin back
wardness. An interesting theme and
a most audacious approache. He
shows quite a polyvalence of values
and also uses up about a third of
your exquisitely-written, mum-leav
ing editorial page.
Meantime, Mexico's Yucatan
movies and Dolores Van Patten pre
sentation filled the Cubberly Audi
torium and the Memorial Theater
respectively, to capacity. Not to
mention things to come, as the Fi
esta to be presented on July 27 un
der the combined, alert leadership
of Romanic Languages Department's
Dr. Rael, Mexico's No. 1 fish length
and-breadth recorder Rene Nunez,
and Casa Espanola's Lois I'm-going
to-Chile Griffitts. (Exuberant Lag
unita's prexy is also going.)
"Columnist" Covey had better
stop his pH 2-like observations or
we'll simply quit taking him to
Wilson's for breakfast on Sunday
mornings, as we've been doing for
the past three odd years. And, for
week-day breakfasts, we'll summar
ily instruct our detachment in the
Strauss-disciplined Cellar platoon to
ignore him at random.
The backward Latins of the
Co-op and other Latins.

To The Editor:
The following is a self-descriptive
statement of what happened to a
tentative meeting that was to be
held near the end of last quarter.
1,000 copies of a circular similar
to what follows were distributed,
but it was too close to finals to ac
complish anything. I hope that the
students, even the new ones, will
make the small effort to do some
thing about this. We can all do
something about it if each of us
drops a note on the A.S.S.U. desk
above the cellar in the Union.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AT STANFORD?
Public Exercises Committee last
week handed down a decision sig
nificant for its arbitrary silencing
of discussion on a subject which
concerns every student and faculty
member: post-war conscription. An
open meeting designed to present
the case against conscription was
planned by a group of interested
students. Discussion and presenta
tion of opinion either pro or con
on such an important subject cannot
be prohibited without opening the
whole question of freedom to as
semble and to discuss any issue that
matters to even one or two indi
viduals.
If. after reading the following
facts, you agree that the Public
Exercises Committe has abused its
power: if yovi see in this a definite
contradiction of what Stanford
means: if you want to lend your
support to an effort to prevent fu
ture arbitrary prohibitions, we urge
you to contact any one of the un
dersigned. excom. or Bob Kennedy,
A.S.S.U. president.
This is what happened:
May 28. Application made to Ex
Com for permission to hold a pro
test meeting re: Peacetime Con
scription.
May 2C. Sect'y of Public Exercises
Committee reserved auditorium for
proposed meeting. Said final approv
al would follow decision of Ex
Com.
May 10. Ex Com approved meet
ing "or Monday. Tune 4.
June 1. Story of meeting carried
in Daily. Notices posted in living
groups.
Same day. Chairman of Public
Exercises Committee, Dr. Heffner,
objected to meeting. Reason: one
sidednoss. This objection was re
tracted after conference with mem

ber of the sponsorng group and new
objection was raised: "Dead Week."
(incidentally an Ex Com ruling)
Public Exercises Committee ihen
formally vetoed the meeting as be
ing a proposed "social function"
slated for "dead week." (which,
however, did not affect the Prom).
What about an authority from
which there is no appeal—an au
thority which says: YOU CAN'T
HOLD A MEETING!
Is that O. K. by you?
