This week the Del Mar Turf Club
resumes operation, a cause for joy
fans. One of sport's hrst war victims
among the southland's race track,
Del Mar has been dormant since
1941. Gasoline rationing was the
main factor for the shutdown, since
Los Angeles and San Diego are the
two big providers for the pari-mu
tual operators, and both villages
are each about fifty miles away
from the track.
â€¢ Buildings Leased
In the interim, however, the build
ings on the race grounds were
leased to Consolidated Vultee Air
craft Corporation, who operated a
feeder shop there in the manufac
ture of small airplane parts.
When VE Day came, and the air
craft lease was relinquished, the
general tone of optimism was so
great that the club's directors de
cided to resume operation this sum
mer.
The track will undoubtedly draw
a strong field of nags, a good many
coming from Caliente, which has en
joyed a terrific boom during the
"prohibition" in the states. Betting
will be terrific, and the "3.2" taste
wonderful, so Bing Crosby's pony
palace will really be going strong
.... Fifty bucks across the board,
Charlie.
Cal Problems
Poor old Cal is having its troubles
again. This time it concerns Roger
Harding, the terrific footballer of
last season. The Hajah was being
counted on this year to be the main
guns in Cal football strategy, but
what happens? Some naughty busi
ness agent for a pro team starts
dangling some enticing bags of
spondoolicks before the innocent
Berkeley boy, and he succumbs to
the evil effects of this hocus-pocus.
So instead of performing for dear
old alma mater next season for hon
or and glory, he will be toting the
pigskin for Cleveland to the tune
of -55500 per annum.
There is a rule between colleges
and pro football leagues that the
pros will not sign anyone till the
player's class has been graduated.
Harding was out of school for one
year because of Uncle Sam's in
sistence. His class graduated last
June, but Roger has one more year
of collegiate competition left due to
his one year in the army. Technic
ally the pros are O. K. in signing
him, but Clint Evans, the Cal Grad
Manager has been arguing the sub
ject on lofty moral issues so strong
ly that he might be switched to
professor of philosophy. The net re
sult is that Cleveland will have one
more excellent player on their
team, and Cal will be minus one
good grid team.
Another reason that might have
prompted Harding to play pro foot
ball is that he would have been in
eligible for the first four games next
season. Several months ago he got
awfully "itchy fingers" for that axe
located in the Cellar, and aided by
several other Calsters, managed to
get the famous Axe out of the case,
but he was caught on his flight back
to Berkeley. A suspension for four
games was the order of the day for
his misdeed.
