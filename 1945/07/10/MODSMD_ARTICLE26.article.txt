# Mural Season Starts Today
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
Intramural Softball games will get
under way this afternoon at 4:30
owing to the addition of two squads
from Toyon Hall. All together nine
teams have signed up, and they have
been divided into two leagues, which
the Daily has named the Sharp
League and the Wolter League, after
the two men who have taken such
a great interest in promoting intra
mural activities.
The Wolter League consists of
four teams: Tyler "Hilltoppeis,"
Toyon I. Med. School, and Sequo
ia; whereas the remaining five,
the Independents, Toyon 11. Arth
ur Hall, Fireliouse, and CATSquad
are in the Sharp League.
Although it is yet early to make
predictions as to the outcome of the
intramural league standings, we
would venture to prophecy that the
"Independents", or what is left of
last quarter's Monroe team, will
make a repeat performance and cop
the top spot in the Sharp League.
Much of the old "Boozer" ten is
gone but Rosburg, Betchter, Alsap,
and the unbeatable Joe Sher still
remain. If pitching is any indica
tion of a team's success then the
"Independents" will be tops. An
other team to watch will be the
"Flacs" or Arthur Hall as they call
themselves now. Next to Sher,
George Malloy is probably the best
pitcher in either league, and this is
good considering that he only start
ed chucking last quarter.
In the Wolter League, the top
teams will probably be the Med.
School sparked by Doc Mason and
Tyler Hall. Tyler made a strong
comeback in the second half of the
spring quarter season and was the
only team able to beat the champ
ionship Monroe squad, although
luck was plainly on their side that
day.

the top spot in the Sharp League.
Much of the old "Boozer" ten is
gone but Rosburg, Betchter, Alsap,
and the unbeatable Joe Sher still
remain. If pitching is any indica
tion of a team's success then the
"Independents" will be tops. An
other team to watch will be the
"Flacs" or Arthur Hall as they call
themselves now. Next to Sher,
George Malloy is probably the best
pitcher in either league, and this is
good considering that he only start
ed chucking last quarter.
In the Wolter League, the top
teams will probably be the Med.
School sparked by Doc Mason and
Tyler Hall. Tyler made a strong
comeback in the second half of the
spring quarter season and was the
only team able to beat the champ
ionship Monroe squad, although
luck was plainly on their side that
day.

All games will be played on the

letics for summer quarter. Regular

games played, and no inning can
begin after 5:45.
Intramural Softball games will get
under way this afternoon at 4:30
owing to the addition of two squads
from Toyon Hall. All together nine
teams have signed up, and they have
been divided into two leagues, which
the Daily has named the Sharp
League and the Wolter League, after
the two men who have taken such
a great interest in promoting intra
mural activities.
The Wolter League consists of
four teams: Tyler "Hilltoppeis,"
Toyon I. Med. School, and Sequo
ia; whereas the remaining five,
the Independents, Toyon 11. Arth
ur Hall, Fireliouse, and CATSquad
are in the Sharp League.
Although it is yet early to make
predictions as to the outcome of the
intramural league standings, we
would venture to prophecy that the
"Independents", or what is left of
last quarter's Monroe team, will
make a repeat performance and cop
the top spot in the Sharp League.
