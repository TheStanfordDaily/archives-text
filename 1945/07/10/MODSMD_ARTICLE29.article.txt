# Bi-Lingual Casa Proves "Good Neighbor" Policy
## 
### VICKY SELLENS 
"Se habla espanol aqui" is expres
sive of the spirit of La Casa Espan
ala of Lagunita Court, which houses
most of the women students par
ticipating in the Latin American
Workshop.
Resolved to both sleep and eat in
Spanish for 8 weeks, Workshop
members have lunch and dinner at
tables reserved for Spanish speak
ing students and served, for the
sake of language solidarity in food
orders, by Spanish speaking Alvaro
Alverde of Costa Rica.
Not only does Casa Espanola,
known before the Latin American
invasion as Casa Olivo, house 20
Workshop students" who are living
there because of the opportunity
to practice Spanish, but it is also j

home to 15 non-Spanish speaking
students who are there because of
crowded housing conditions.
As spokesman for the 15 "out
landers" who are faced by incom
prehensible bulletin board an
nouncements and neighbors who
"habla" in the language of Cervan
tes, Bev French said, "It's all right
if you have an interpreter." The
other non-Latins admitted that it
was a good opportunity to prac
tice the Good Neighbor policy.
Although Casa Espanola has no
balconies, the social room has at
tracted many of the campus cabal
leros who come, if not to serenade,
at least to converse in their native
tongue. Last week, as part of Lagu
nita's pre-fourth celebration, the
Casa entertained the Latin American
students at an Open House.
Other social activities of Casa Es
panola residents include the "in
stitucion del cafe" every Tuesday at
4 in the Education Building for all
those affiliated with the Workshop.
Spanish is spoken at these meetings,
and students and faculty have a
chance to get acquainted over a cup
of (supposedly South American)
coffee.
As an added feature of this year's
workshop, special conversation
groups meet three times a week un
der the direction of Lilian Sidwell
of Argentina. Consuelo Seymour of
Guatemala, and Julieta del Castillo,
the resident assistant in the Casa.
Future plans for Casa residents
are primarily directed toward the
schoolroom, as seven are already
teachers and most of the others are
planning to be. Several plan to travel
in Latin America, and* at least two,
Lois Grifhtts and Sara Mae Wills,
hope to carry on advanced studies
in Chile.
Among the few dissenters from
the teaching profession, Edith Jar
rell and Mary Ann Hunt are hope
ful of combining travel and work in
positions with Pan-American Air
lines. whereas some of the girls in
keeping with Latin spirit have put
off deciding about the future until
"manana."
