"June comes around every year |
. . Across the dry, barren oven- j
like wastes of Quad, through the
moorish arches, deserted on the Sab
bath, up the hot, tortuous defiles of
Lomita Drive, trek three pilgrims.
The vision of what they seek is con
stantly before their eyes like a mi
rage. A lake-cool, blue, ruffled by
gentle breezes, sparkling as though
filled with a thousand gems, and
sweet to the taste.
At last they are almost at their
goal. Through their dust-dimmed
eyes they can discern the classic out
lines of a long, low, white building.
They clamber up the sun-scorched
hill in a last burst of energy and be
holdâ€”but there is no cool-blue-ruf
fled-by-breezes - Sparkling - as -
though - filled - with-a-thousand
gems lake.
In despair, one of the heat-crazed
pilgrims falls on her face (Drunk
again?) upon the ground, grinding
her teeth in the hot dust. (Good old
Encina food!) The other two snap
under the strain of disappointment
and start to babble insanely, "which
way did it go. George? Which way
did it go?", beating each other with
their articles of their sun-worship
rites, i.e., bathing suits.
And this touching drama just goes
to show you that you are a fool to
come here Summer quarter when
you could be at home taking it easy,
or taking it any way you can get it.
(Ya wanta quart or a stubbie, Mist
ah-) It also is another situation to
which the adage of the famous sage
of that ancient university, Stan
l'ordet-surgle-Seine, can be applied.
Quote, "C'est la tough one to lose."
Unquote. No lake!!
And on a little bridge near Roble
sits a young maiden, tossing slugs
into the fetid water that flows from
the once beautiful lake, and she
sings, "Pennies in a stream . .
