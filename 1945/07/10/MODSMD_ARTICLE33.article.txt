# Dr. Willis Works on Survey Map of Campus Trees
## 
### TED DRENTON 
Few students know that the oak by
the Art Museum bus stop is one of
the finest specimens in this, region,
states Dr. Bailey Willis, professor
Emeritus of geology, who is making
a survey of campus trees at the re
quest of President Donald B.
Tressider.
This oak was selected on last
Commencement day to be the official
"Pioneer Oak," replacing the one
originally chosen by the class of '95
which has since been destroyed. A
plaque designating the tree's new
status has been placed on the oak.
"The oak," says Dr. Willis, "is
not a very long-lived tree as is the
California Redwood."
The oldest oaks on the campus
are from 80 to 100 years old and in
their natural spacing give the
campus the aspect of an English
park. The oaks at Stanford have
grown well where the soil is gravelly
or sandy; however, when planted
in adobe soil the tree grows stunted.
Opposite the oak by the Art Mu
seum stand two varieties of cedars,
near the curb the Atlas Cedar from
Morrocco and behind it, the beau
tiful cedar of India.
Traveling toward the Hoover Li
brary, on the next corner one sees
two very curious trees that come
from Southern Brazil. Ancestors of
these trees. Araucarian pines, lived
at least 20,000.000 years ago.

The Eucalyptus trees which were
brought into this region to protect
the more tender trees have proved
robbers, as they spread a net of
roots a few inches below the surface
and monopolize the moisture. The
Eucalyptus has killed the Arbare
tum, originally planted with the oth
er foreign trees.
Traveling up Palm Drive, one may
see on the left several old redwoods,
which were planted by Sen; >r
Stanford as a part of an avenue" -
signed to lead to his proposed resi
dence where the Mausoleum is now
located.
The ornamental trees on campus
have suffered from lack of care and
no longer beautify the grounds. Pre
sident Tressider plans to make them
campus attractions again.
Dr. Willis started the survey ot
the campus trees a year ago when
President T^e^uier,,decided to have
the important frees located on a map
Maps have already been made of the
Inner Quad, the Library, the area
around Sequoui Hall, and the uppet
half of Palm drive.
A map similar to the one plannec
for the trees of Stanford has al
ready been made to record the trees
in Yosemite National Park.
