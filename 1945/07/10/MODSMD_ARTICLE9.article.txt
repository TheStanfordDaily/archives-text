# Overheard at Friday's Army Dance: "You Know, He's a Pretty Good Joe"
## 
### GEORGE BRUNN 
The other day we heard two ASTs
discussing their new battalion CO.
"He's a pretty good Joe," they de
cided. As we know very few bat
talion commanders worthy of such
praise we decided to investigate,
expecting little more than another
grouchy, middle-aged major.
Down at Military Headquarters
they referred vis to a young soldier
who looked like an AST. We were
about to ask him where we could
find Major Duckstad when we no
ticed the gold leaf on his shirt. "I'm
Major Duckstad," he said. Involun
tarily we asked him for his age. 27.
Majors like this we had only seen
in the Air Corps, but he was from
the tanks.
Major Duckstad is in the regular
army. He entered in 1939 as a re
serve officer. "That was under the
Thomason Act," he explained. ' Un
der it. about 50 out of every thous
and reserve officers received com
missions in the regular army." I got
mine in the infantry."
Back in his civilian days he at
tended Gettysburg College in Penn
sylvania, where he majored in math
and languages. He was a member
of Phi Gamma Delta, played a lot

of soccer and did some semi-pvo
swimming. He graduated in 1939.
In 1940 when our armored forces
were just beginning to be organized
he transferred to the tanks. He at
tended a number of service schools,
such as the Radio School at Ft.
Monmouth, the Commanding Gen
eral Staff School at Ft. Leavenworth
and the Tactics Course of the
Armored School at Ft. Knox. He
went through the Carolina, Louisi
ana and Dessert Maneuvers. On ma
neuvers he incurred a bad knee in
jury which has kept him from go
ing overseas.
Army men often believe that their
branch is winning the war all by
itself, but the major explained earn
estly that the armored force can
never take the place of the in
fantry.
He likes Stanford a great deal and
is particularly pleased with the
amount of cooperation he has been
getting from the faculty.
The major is married and has a
sixteen month old son. He makes his
home in Chicago. His post-war plans
aren't definite yet.
Our conclusion: he IS a pretty
good Joe.
