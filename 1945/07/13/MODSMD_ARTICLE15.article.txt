Missing: One Club
In January '28 a committee from U.C.L.A.
visited the campus with a plan for "promoting
international action through intercollegiate
circles." This committee included the vice
president of the Asociated Students at U.C.L.A.,
a Varsity Debater, and the director of the News
Bureau.
Although dubbed a "faerie tale" in a Daily
Editorial of the same week, the new Interna
tional Relations Club, as it was then called, met
bi-monthly off and on for the next 16 years.
The sixteenth year takes us up to the present
time, when unfortunately it is off.
The Carnegie Foundation supplied more
than 100 books and periodicals on international
subject for the members' use; the Club had in
tormal round-table discussions, led by men
with expert knowledge in the field of inter
national affairs; and the foundation also planned
to send its speakers to various International
Relations Clubs about the country.
More recently under the chairmanship of
Servet Duran, the"I" Club, in addition to its
regular meetings on alternate Sunday evenings,
also sponsored a few successful dances in the
Nitery.
In Excom tov/ard the end of last quarter, a 525
increase in the budget of the"I" Club was dis
cussed and passed. This added appropriation
placed a total of $55 at the disposal of the Club.
Since this appropriation, we have had only
silence from the International Club. Perhaps
the old members are stunned by the additional
tunds available for Club activities. Or perhaps
they have lost interest in their Club and are
willing to sit back and watch a new group of
International Tea-Drinkers take over their job
and possibly their funds.
