# Bull Session
## 
### 
Dear Mrs. Editor:
I guess you'll think I'm kind of nuts just writing to
you out of a clear sky like this, but I recently seen a
copy of your paper at the place where I work at which
a Standford student left in here the other day when he
was in here getting a burger, or maybe it was a cheese
burger, I forget. Well, anyway I seen this paper and
[ seen that Bull Session column in it and it seemed to
me, if you don't mind my saying it, that whoever wrote
that thing didn't have much to say and I got to think
ing of what I would say if I was writing that article,
and then, silly thing that I am, I decided to write down
what I would say if I was writing tho article, which is
what I'm doing now. (My mom would be furious if she
knew I was doing this, cause she would say it was
brassy of me to think I had anything to say that
Standford students would be interested in, and she is
always saying I'm too brassy as it is.)
Well, anyway Mrs. Editor what I really wanted to
tell you about was a party I was at a little while back
which was held at the house of a Standford student
who has an estate near here. Now dont get me wrong
and go to thinking that I was a guest at this party,
cause I wasn't. You see, I was just helping out my
GF Helen who was helping out her mother who works
tor these people all the time. It was what they call a
jocktale party and all I had to do was pass cocktales
and orederves around to the guests.

Well, being that all the guests at this party was
Standford students, I was sort of interested, to here
what they was saying as I was passing the orederves
to them, cause I thought maybe I could learn some
thing about politics or science or something from what
I heard them say. Well, imagine my surprise when I
heard one boy telling a girl about how he was drunk
every night of his vacation and a girl telling a boy
about a party she was at which she passed out from
drinking and another boy telling a girl how they
wouldnt take his blood at the bloodbank, cause there
was too much alkohol in it.
Now dont get me wrong Mrs. Editor, I got nothing
against drinking (I frequently go up to Congers and the
Wagon Wheels and those places with my BF and drink
Cuba Leebras, which is my favorite drink) but I don't
see whats so good about it, and I was certainly sur
prised to hear those Standford students talking about
it so much.
I was even more surprised than that later on that
night when the boys was all gone outside (what for I
dont know) and the girls was setting around the living
room and
Oh, oh! The doorbell just rang which is my BF
who is just back from overseas and is pretty hard to
handle, so I got to close this kind of sudden like, but
maybe I will write you some more later on.
Yours truly,
MARGIE (from Mountain View)
p.s. I sure hope this isnt too brassy on my part,
cause mom would be awful mad at me if it was.

always saying I'm too brassy as it is.)
Well, anyway Mrs. Editor what I really wanted to
tell you about was a party I was at a little while back
which was held at the house of a Standford student
who has an estate near here. Now dont get me wrong
and go to thinking that I was a guest at this party,
cause I wasn't. You see, I was just helping out my
GF Helen who was helping out her mother who works
tor these people all the time. It was what they call a
jocktale party and all I had to do was pass cocktales
and orederves around to the guests.

Well, being that all the guests at this party was
Standford students, I was sort of interested, to here
what they was saying as I was passing the orederves
to them, cause I thought maybe I could learn some
thing about politics or science or something from what
I heard them say. Well, imagine my surprise when I
heard one boy telling a girl about how he was drunk
every night of his vacation and a girl telling a boy
about a party she was at which she passed out from
drinking and another boy telling a girl how they
wouldnt take his blood at the bloodbank, cause there
was too much alkohol in it.
Now dont get me wrong Mrs. Editor, I got nothing
against drinking (I frequently go up to Congers and the
Wagon Wheels and those places with my BF and drink
Cuba Leebras, which is my favorite drink) but I don't
see whats so good about it, and I was certainly sur
prised to hear those Standford students talking about
it so much.
I was even more surprised than that later on that
night when the boys was all gone outside (what for I
dont know) and the girls was setting around the living
room and
Oh, oh! The doorbell just rang which is my BF
who is just back from overseas and is pretty hard to
handle, so I got to close this kind of sudden like, but
maybe I will write you some more later on.
Yours truly,
MARGIE (from Mountain View)
p.s. I sure hope this isnt too brassy on my part,
cause mom would be awful mad at me if it was.
Dear Mrs. Editor:
I guess you'll think I'm kind of nuts just writing to
you out of a clear sky like this, but I recently seen a
copy of your paper at the place where I work at which
a Standford student left in here the other day when he
was in here getting a burger, or maybe it was a cheese
burger, I forget. Well, anyway I seen this paper and
[ seen that Bull Session column in it and it seemed to
me, if you don't mind my saying it, that whoever wrote
that thing didn't have much to say and I got to think
ing of what I would say if I was writing that article,
and then, silly thing that I am, I decided to write down
what I would say if I was writing tho article, which is
what I'm doing now. (My mom would be furious if she
knew I was doing this, cause she would say it was
brassy of me to think I had anything to say that
Standford students would be interested in, and she is
always saying I'm too brassy as it is.)
