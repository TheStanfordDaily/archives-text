### CYCLONE COVEY 
THE LATIN AMERICAN FIESTA of July 27 is liable
to be a flop.
My personal suggestion to the jingoes at the Co-op
was that iL be held in the lake bed with a grand finale
in which the water is let back in.
But they consider that that would require too much
actual arrangement without sufficient preliminary ges
ticulation. For the desii'able project is something
which will be no trouble at all to arrange, so that the
whole time may be spent in loud and emotional
planning for it.
They asked me for a contribution to help finance the
Fiesta, and when I inquired what it was I would be
helping to finance, they said the typical South Amer
ican refreshments, which are to be cokes and dough
nuts.
"Why don't you make it a genuine Latin American
fiesta?" I asked them.
"Well because it would cost $800 for the Mexican
glass alone," answered Mexico's most distinguished
measurer of the length and breadth of fish.
"Why, I wouldn't mind settling for North American
plates," I said.
But a fiesta without Mexican glass was obviously too
much for the Latins to contemplate, so they are going
to make it a North American fiesta after all.
It is surprising they have settled on a definite day
more than a week ahead of time. But that is only be
cause they wish especially to commemorate the birth
day of Gunnar Sandnes, prominent anatomical teacher
and figure, whom on the 27th they are making an
honorary Latin for his interest in South American
biological problems.
Meanwhile, the Latins are making no decisions about
where the Fiesta is to be held or what it is to consist
of, preferring rather to hold themselves in suspense.

SUDS IN YOUR EYE, which still has tonight and
tomorrow night to run at the Palo Alto Community
Theater, is inspiringly set in a San Diego junk yard,

where several middle-aged women
profitably occupy their time with a
continuous round of beer-drinking.
Thus the title toast. '"Suds in your
eye."
The play is a pointless comedy,
, which gets its laughs by the re
liable expedient of a "hell" or a
"damn" in every other line, and by
- a sprinkling of below-the-belt in
nuendoes.
Now the Community Theater is
an exceptional institution. It has

facilities and players for the best of plays, and au
diences of a caliber to appreciate the best. It is in fact
inconceivable that a play could flop in the Community
Theater. Where then is the percentage in this stooping
to grut?
But you may be sure that the Players put even the
meagre Suds on as best it can be done. Their special
mastery is casting. A Spanish teacher is played by a
woman who can speak Spanish, who even maybe is a
Spanish teacher. A Chinese boy is played by a Chinese
boy. And so on.
The star is Cornelia Burdick, for whom no line is
too cheap to play for all it is worth. But everybody
plays his pari as if the play were after all worthy of
his mest efforts.
Stanfordites no doubt would find the stage talents of
Chester Barker the most humorously displayed.
