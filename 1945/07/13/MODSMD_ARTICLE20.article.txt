# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the Subscribers
of ihe 1945 Quad:
Many, many of you have asked
me when the 1945 Quad is going to
come out, how you can get your
copy, and what has caused the
delay.
The reason for the book's being
late are varied, but I would like
to explain that delay was not due
to any shortage of materials nor to
any lack of effort on the part of
the students who sold advertising
—more, in fact, than is usually con
tracted. The delay was caused,
however, by mismanagement on the
part of the Editorial Chief and diffi
culty with the photographer.
I do not know exactly when the
Quad will come out, but I hope
sometime in August. A notice will
appear in the Daily when that happy
event takes alace.
Those of you who are on campus
and will be able to pick up your
copies in person will be given that
opportunity. The time and place will
be announced. The rest of the books
will be mailed, with postage paid
by the Quad office.
I have received many letters ask
ing me to tell the writers how they
can obtain their books. I can not
answer all of the letters but rest
assured that you will get your
copies. We have home addresses
taken from the Reg cards that you
fill out every quarter; we have
kept all of the letters requesting a
change in mailing address and the
labels will be made out accord
ingly.
We will do our best to get the
'45 Quads to you so please be pa
tient and bear with us.

To the Editor:
Last Tuesday, a very spirited and
challenging letter appeared in the
Daily which called on students to
stand for "FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AT STANFORD." The authors of
that letter cried out against authori
ties "from which there is no ap
peal," and made pointed accusations
against certain university organiza
tions. Although I am sympathetic
with their point of view, in fairness
to the student body and those ac
cused of authoritarianism, it seems
the whole picture should be pre
sented.

In the first place, let it be under
stood that the Committee on Public
Exercises is NOT an ultimate au
thority. This committee derives all
of its power from the university
Executive Committee, headed by the
President of Stanford. Dr. Tress ider
and his committee can override the
Committee 011 Public Exercises at
ANY time. Hence, there is an ap
peal above the Public Exercise's
office.
Furthermore, regardless of the
approval of the date for June 4,
that day was in dead week; and
June 2, the day of the Junior Prom
was not. The ASSU ruling on dei
week, made in the early part w< .
Spring Quarter, states: "No social
function shall be held SIX days
prior to end quarter exams." It is
unfortunate that the people of the
Public Exercises' office, and the stu
dent body as a whole, were not
properly notified of this new ruling
concerning dead week.
This meeting, as does the Joftre
Debate, comes under dead week rul
ing, for the Social Policy says, any
"functions lasting after 8 p. m. in the
evening must be granted dates by
the Executive Committee. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
Sunday evenings (unless before a
holiday) are not open after 8 p. nt.
for social, dramatic, or SIMILAR
functions" without the approval o?
Excom.
As to what actually happened be
tween these boys and the people
of Fublic Exercises, there is more
to the story than has been said.
It was first thought that this
meeting would be all right. But
Dr. Heffner, Chairman of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, denied
permission for the meeting. This
action was taken IN ACCORDANCE
with a UNIVERSITY REGULA
TION which prohibits meetings 0:1
this campus that present one point
of view. Dr. Heffner did this on
the basis of a letter (dated May
31) from the chaii'man of the anti
post war conscription group, which
said in part: ". . . the meeting sh j
consist of a panel of student speak
ers talking against the proposed en
actment of permanent military con
scription, with all persons interested 1
invited to attend."
Please note that this letter was
given to the committee 011 the last
day the Daily went to press, and
that Dr. Heffner was unable to make
the situation known to the people
involved until Friday, June 1, after
the paper was on the streets. The
announcement in that paper came
before official clearance had been
granted.
Dr. Heffner then did his utmost
to make arrangements to hold the
meeting, but it was too late for a
satisfactory solution.
This letter has been an effort to
fill in where there have been some
misunderstandings. The statements
that have been made were checked
for treir accuracy at the time the
incident occurred, and were re
checked this week.
Notwithstanding what has been
said, if there is interest in having
a discussion on ihis conscription
issue, and if there are people on
this campus who want to present
their view against it, then why the
waste of energy taking shots at the
Committee on Public Exercises? At;
the time when the request was made
for this meeting, Dr. Heffner and
the members of his committee sug
gested that a representative meet
ing be held this summer, since it
could not be held last June. There -
fore, Messrs. Thompson and Scott,
if Public Exercises is in favor, if
Excom. is in favor, and if you are
in favor, why don't we hold the
meeting this summer?
Sincerely.

was not. The ASSU ruling on dei
week, made in the early part w< .
Spring Quarter, states: "No social
function shall be held SIX days
prior to end quarter exams." It is
unfortunate that the people of the
Public Exercises' office, and the stu
dent body as a whole, were not
properly notified of this new ruling
concerning dead week.
This meeting, as does the Joftre
Debate, comes under dead week rul
ing, for the Social Policy says, any
"functions lasting after 8 p. m. in the
evening must be granted dates by
the Executive Committee. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
Sunday evenings (unless before a
holiday) are not open after 8 p. nt.
for social, dramatic, or SIMILAR
functions" without the approval o?
Excom.
As to what actually happened be
tween these boys and the people
of Fublic Exercises, there is more
to the story than has been said.
It was first thought that this
meeting would be all right. But
Dr. Heffner, Chairman of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, denied
permission for the meeting. This
action was taken IN ACCORDANCE
with a UNIVERSITY REGULA
TION which prohibits meetings 0:1
this campus that present one point
of view. Dr. Heffner did this on
the basis of a letter (dated May
31) from the chaii'man of the anti
post war conscription group, which
said in part: ". . . the meeting sh j
consist of a panel of student speak
ers talking against the proposed en
actment of permanent military con
scription, with all persons interested 1
invited to attend."
Please note that this letter was
given to the committee 011 the last
day the Daily went to press, and
that Dr. Heffner was unable to make
the situation known to the people
involved until Friday, June 1, after
the paper was on the streets. The
announcement in that paper came
before official clearance had been
granted.
Dr. Heffner then did his utmost
to make arrangements to hold the
meeting, but it was too late for a
satisfactory solution.
This letter has been an effort to
fill in where there have been some
misunderstandings. The statements
that have been made were checked
for treir accuracy at the time the
incident occurred, and were re
checked this week.
Notwithstanding what has been
said, if there is interest in having
a discussion on ihis conscription
issue, and if there are people on
this campus who want to present
their view against it, then why the
waste of energy taking shots at the
Committee on Public Exercises? At;
the time when the request was made
for this meeting, Dr. Heffner and
the members of his committee sug
gested that a representative meet
ing be held this summer, since it
could not be held last June. There -
fore, Messrs. Thompson and Scott,
if Public Exercises is in favor, if
Excom. is in favor, and if you are
in favor, why don't we hold the
meeting this summer?
Sincerely.

To the Subscribers
of ihe 1945 Quad:
Many, many of you have asked
me when the 1945 Quad is going to
come out, how you can get your
copy, and what has caused the
delay.
The reason for the book's being
late are varied, but I would like
to explain that delay was not due
to any shortage of materials nor to
any lack of effort on the part of
the students who sold advertising
—more, in fact, than is usually con
tracted. The delay was caused,
however, by mismanagement on the
part of the Editorial Chief and diffi
culty with the photographer.
I do not know exactly when the
Quad will come out, but I hope
sometime in August. A notice will
appear in the Daily when that happy
event takes alace.
Those of you who are on campus
and will be able to pick up your
copies in person will be given that
opportunity. The time and place will
be announced. The rest of the books
will be mailed, with postage paid
by the Quad office.
I have received many letters ask
ing me to tell the writers how they
can obtain their books. I can not
answer all of the letters but rest
assured that you will get your
copies. We have home addresses
taken from the Reg cards that you
fill out every quarter; we have
kept all of the letters requesting a
change in mailing address and the
labels will be made out accord
ingly.
We will do our best to get the
'45 Quads to you so please be pa

To the Editor:
Last Tuesday, a very spirited and
challenging letter appeared in the
Daily which called on students to
stand for "FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AT STANFORD." The authors of
that letter cried out against authori
ties "from which there is no ap
peal," and made pointed accusations
against certain university organiza
tions. Although I am sympathetic
with their point of view, in fairness
to the student body and those ac
cused of authoritarianism, it seems
the whole picture should be pre
sented.

In the first place, let it be under
stood that the Committee on Public
Exercises is NOT an ultimate au
thority. This committee derives all
of its power from the university
Executive Committee, headed by the
President of Stanford. Dr. Tress ider
and his committee can override the
Committee 011 Public Exercises at
ANY time. Hence, there is an ap
peal above the Public Exercise's
office.

approval of the date for June 4,

could not be held last June. There -

if Public Exercises is in favor, if

Student Manager.
To the Subscribers
of ihe 1945 Quad:
Many, many of you have asked
me when the 1945 Quad is going to
come out, how you can get your
copy, and what has caused the
delay.
The reason for the book's being
late are varied, but I would like
to explain that delay was not due
to any shortage of materials nor to
any lack of effort on the part of
the students who sold advertising
—more, in fact, than is usually con
tracted. The delay was caused,
however, by mismanagement on the
part of the Editorial Chief and diffi
culty with the photographer.
I do not know exactly when the
Quad will come out, but I hope
sometime in August. A notice will
appear in the Daily when that happy
event takes alace.
Those of you who are on campus
and will be able to pick up your
copies in person will be given that
opportunity. The time and place will
be announced. The rest of the books
will be mailed, with postage paid
by the Quad office.
I have received many letters ask
ing me to tell the writers how they
can obtain their books. I can not
answer all of the letters but rest
assured that you will get your
copies. We have home addresses
taken from the Reg cards that you
fill out every quarter; we have
kept all of the letters requesting a
change in mailing address and the
labels will be made out accord
ingly.
We will do our best to get the
'45 Quads to you so please be pa
tient and bear with us.

To the Editor:
Last Tuesday, a very spirited and
challenging letter appeared in the
Daily which called on students to
stand for "FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AT STANFORD." The authors of
that letter cried out against authori
ties "from which there is no ap
peal," and made pointed accusations
against certain university organiza
tions. Although I am sympathetic
with their point of view, in fairness
to the student body and those ac
cused of authoritarianism, it seems
the whole picture should be pre
sented.

In the first place, let it be under
stood that the Committee on Public
Exercises is NOT an ultimate au
thority. This committee derives all
of its power from the university
Executive Committee, headed by the
President of Stanford. Dr. Tress ider
and his committee can override the
Committee 011 Public Exercises at
ANY time. Hence, there is an ap
peal above the Public Exercise's
office.
Furthermore, regardless of the
approval of the date for June 4,
that day was in dead week; and
June 2, the day of the Junior Prom
was not. The ASSU ruling on dei
week, made in the early part w< .
Spring Quarter, states: "No social
function shall be held SIX days
prior to end quarter exams." It is
unfortunate that the people of the
Public Exercises' office, and the stu
dent body as a whole, were not
properly notified of this new ruling
concerning dead week.
This meeting, as does the Joftre
Debate, comes under dead week rul
ing, for the Social Policy says, any
"functions lasting after 8 p. m. in the
evening must be granted dates by
the Executive Committee. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
Sunday evenings (unless before a
holiday) are not open after 8 p. nt.
for social, dramatic, or SIMILAR
functions" without the approval o?
Excom.
As to what actually happened be
tween these boys and the people
of Fublic Exercises, there is more
to the story than has been said.
It was first thought that this
meeting would be all right. But
Dr. Heffner, Chairman of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, denied
permission for the meeting. This
action was taken IN ACCORDANCE
with a UNIVERSITY REGULA
TION which prohibits meetings 0:1
this campus that present one point
of view. Dr. Heffner did this on
the basis of a letter (dated May
31) from the chaii'man of the anti
post war conscription group, which
said in part: ". . . the meeting sh j
consist of a panel of student speak
ers talking against the proposed en
actment of permanent military con
scription, with all persons interested 1
invited to attend."
Please note that this letter was
given to the committee 011 the last
day the Daily went to press, and
that Dr. Heffner was unable to make
the situation known to the people
involved until Friday, June 1, after
the paper was on the streets. The
announcement in that paper came
before official clearance had been
granted.
Dr. Heffner then did his utmost
to make arrangements to hold the
meeting, but it was too late for a
satisfactory solution.
This letter has been an effort to
fill in where there have been some
misunderstandings. The statements
that have been made were checked
for treir accuracy at the time the
incident occurred, and were re
checked this week.
Notwithstanding what has been
said, if there is interest in having
a discussion on ihis conscription
issue, and if there are people on
this campus who want to present
their view against it, then why the
waste of energy taking shots at the
Committee on Public Exercises? At;
the time when the request was made
for this meeting, Dr. Heffner and
the members of his committee sug
