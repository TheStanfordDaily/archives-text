### VIC BILL 
The door to room 319 was thrown
open; a seemingly masculine figure
entered; immediately the three oc
cupants jumped to attention. Then
the ERC's realized that it was only
Walt Fleher, so with mumbled
oaths they resumed their seats.
'"Which one of you is Halbstein,"
asked Fleher. *
"Me," came the meek answer.
"I hear you play the saxophone,"
continued the great conductor.
"Yes, but—"
"Swell, how'd you like to play for
Ihe army swing band?"
"But—"
"I knew you'd do it."
"But sir—"
"Okay, see you at practice Tues
day night."
"But Mister Fleher—"
"No buts. Do you want your pass
privilege taken away?"
"No sir, but—."
"Okay then, be there ready to go
cn Tuesday."
"But ."
The door slammed shut. Too late,
the eminent maestro was on his way.
Under the able management of
Bert Feinberg and Bill Helfand, and
with the capable leadership of Walt
Fleher (dance without a care), the
tend will make its debut before the
entire campus tonight. However,
great leadership alone cannot pro
duce the great quality of music that
comes forth from so sensational a
group. And so by means of the
process mentioned above, they were
forced to acquire musicians. And
what musicians!!!!
So stumble with us, O gentle
reader, up the oft-stumbled stairs
of the art gallery, that have felt the
gentle tread of Meemi, Baumeister,
Meemi, Herman, Meemi, Claude,
Meemi, and of course Meemi . . .
And what do we hear? Beethoven?
Brahms? Basie? These melliflous
tones are, yes, you guessed it read
er, the Army Swing Band!
The sax section that is drawing
nation wide attention is headed by
Bob Drasnin. This budding star is
already a veteran of such great out
fits as Joe Venuti's band and Hoagy
Charmichael's latest group of young
musicians, the Teen Agers. That is
until last week, when he succumbed
to the lure of a uniform and joined
the army. Not until you have heard
him yourself will you be able to
fully appreciate the marvelous tech
nique Bob has acquired. But this
junior "Shaw" is not the only out
standing member of a star studded
reed section. Sandy Eakles, whose
handling of the bass clarinet brings
memories of Hal Mclntyre; Morris
Rifkin, Sandy Wilbourn and the
above mentioned Halbstein also add
to the greatness of the sax section.
And of course there is Toyon's own
Ed Wilford, whose brilliant work on
the Tenor Sax makes him a second
Coleman Hawkins.
Rounding out the band is a full
rhythm section, with leader Fleher
on piano. So come one, come all,
to the second army dance of the
summer quarter at the Pavilion to
night. Remember our theme, "dance
without a care to the music of Walt
Fleher." Or as Teddy Wilson so
aptly put it, "Music foul, music
fair. Music played by Walter
Fleher" . . .

entered; immediately the three oc
cupants jumped to attention. Then
the ERC's realized that it was only
Walt Fleher, so with mumbled
oaths they resumed their seats.
'"Which one of you is Halbstein,"
asked Fleher. *
"Me," came the meek answer.
"I hear you play the saxophone,"
continued the great conductor.
"Yes, but—"
"Swell, how'd you like to play for
Ihe army swing band?"
"But—"
"I knew you'd do it."
"But sir—"
"Okay, see you at practice Tues
day night."
"But Mister Fleher—"
"No buts. Do you want your pass
privilege taken away?"
"No sir, but—."
"Okay then, be there ready to go
cn Tuesday."
"But ."
The door slammed shut. Too late,
the eminent maestro was on his way.
Under the able management of
Bert Feinberg and Bill Helfand, and
with the capable leadership of Walt
Fleher (dance without a care), the
tend will make its debut before the
entire campus tonight. However,
great leadership alone cannot pro
duce the great quality of music that
comes forth from so sensational a
group. And so by means of the
process mentioned above, they were
forced to acquire musicians. And
what musicians!!!!
So stumble with us, O gentle
reader, up the oft-stumbled stairs
of the art gallery, that have felt the
gentle tread of Meemi, Baumeister,
Meemi, Herman, Meemi, Claude,
Meemi, and of course Meemi . . .
And what do we hear? Beethoven?
Brahms? Basie? These melliflous
tones are, yes, you guessed it read
er, the Army Swing Band!
The sax section that is drawing
nation wide attention is headed by
Bob Drasnin. This budding star is
already a veteran of such great out
fits as Joe Venuti's band and Hoagy
Charmichael's latest group of young
musicians, the Teen Agers. That is
until last week, when he succumbed
to the lure of a uniform and joined
the army. Not until you have heard
him yourself will you be able to
fully appreciate the marvelous tech
nique Bob has acquired. But this
junior "Shaw" is not the only out
standing member of a star studded
reed section. Sandy Eakles, whose
handling of the bass clarinet brings
memories of Hal Mclntyre; Morris
Rifkin, Sandy Wilbourn and the
above mentioned Halbstein also add
to the greatness of the sax section.
And of course there is Toyon's own
Ed Wilford, whose brilliant work on
the Tenor Sax makes him a second
Coleman Hawkins.
Rounding out the band is a full
rhythm section, with leader Fleher
on piano. So come one, come all,
to the second army dance of the
summer quarter at the Pavilion to
night. Remember our theme, "dance
without a care to the music of Walt
Fleher." Or as Teddy Wilson so
aptly put it, "Music foul, music
fair. Music played by Walter
Fleher" . . .
The door to room 319 was thrown
open; a seemingly masculine figure
entered; immediately the three oc
cupants jumped to attention. Then
the ERC's realized that it was only
Walt Fleher, so with mumbled
oaths they resumed their seats.
