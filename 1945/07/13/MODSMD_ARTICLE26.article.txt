# Captain Brown—Soon To Receive Farewell Salute From ASTU Here
## 
### 
Calm Pacific waters will greet Captain Brown instead of ASTs shortly
after July 19, 1945. Retiring to inactive duty after many years of service
in the AUS. Capt. Brown plans to enjoy a long vacation at his Manhattan
Beach (Calif.) residence. Future work in engineering fields will probably
follow after a rest.
A good many years of Capt. Brown's career have been spent as a
director and officer of men's groups. In 1934 he was with a CCC unit
operating in Idaho and Southern California. When the war broke out. he
shifted to Camp Roberts, Calif., and enjoyed its torments for a period.
From there he came, at last, to Stanford.
Captain Brown has commanded the battalion and Company A at
alternating intervals—sometimes both simultaneously. Famed as the man
with the busy penknife, the captain has kept Co. A on its toes for many
a room-inspect ion.
The ASTU at Stanford will be truly sorry to loose Capt. Brown but
wishes him much happiness and success in the future!
