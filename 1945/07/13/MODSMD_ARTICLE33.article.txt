Amidst the 17-year old youngsters
;.nd 4-F Adonises around the Farm,
a six foot plus, 200-pound mass of
nuscles stands out terrifically. His
name is Victor J. Lindskog. He is
an athletic instructor.
Vic graduated in 1942. and in
his two years of undergraduate
work at Stanford, lie starred bril
liantly in football, winning for
himself a place among the list of
Indian gridiron immortals.
After attending high school in
Montana, he entered Santa Ana J.C.,
where his football playing attracted
nationwide attention. Powerfully
built—an ideal lineman—Vic de
cided on playing the center position
permanently while in J. C.
Stanford Days
Two years at Santa Ana com
pleted, Lindskog could think of no
better place to continue his scholas
4ic and athletic career than Stan
ford.
Playing on the famous "Model
T" of 1940, Vic won All-Coast
honors. The immense success of
the T formation that year induced
practically every college in the
country to follow suit the next
season. No small part did the line,
headed by Lindskog. play in that
road to fame in '40.
Opposing Nebraska in the 1941
Rose Bowl, Vic played his greatest
game. He blocked several punts
deep in Cornhusker territory, pav
ing the way for Stanford scoring.
His repeated "impossible" tackles
broke up the opponent's offense.
Although Stanford failed to
achieve the same success the fol
]owing season. Vic continued to play
his outstanding brand of ball, and
again he placed on the All-Coast
team, along with honorable men
lion on the All-American team.
For the next three years, '42. to
'44. he played on the college All-
Star team against the winner of the
National League professional league.
Vic is the only player to have ever
achieved the honor of participating
in three contests. The game of '43
was undoubtedly the greatest, for
they beat the great Washington Red
skin team starring Sammy Baugh.
Played Pro Ball
Last season he played for the
Philadelphia Eagles in the pro cir
cuit, and also coached a winning
high school team while he was back
East. He might follow the same
course this year.

With intercollegiate sports out
for the past two years, Vic's duties
have been confined to that of men
toring the boxing squads. Boxing
is no strange sport to Victor; he's
sparred with California's pride. Max
Baer.
V. J. is all keyed up about Stan
ford returning to intercollegiate
sports next year. He will handle
the boxing squad, for which lie
has several outstanding prospects
now. As for football the follow
ing season. Vic says,"It all de
pends on what the navy sends us."
