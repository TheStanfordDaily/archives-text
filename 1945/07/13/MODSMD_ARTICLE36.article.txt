# Sher Hurls No Hitter
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
The official beginning of the in
tramural season was again post
poned, although three tilts were

played Thursday.
Toyon II was
shut out by the
"In d ependents"
9-0. Toyon I lost
a close one to
the Tyler "Hill
toppers" 7-5, and
Arthur Hall eked
out a close vic
tory over the
Med. School 11-
10.

In the Toyon 11-"lndependent"
contest, Joe Sher pitched a ter
rific no hit. no run game and his
team backed him by committing
no errors. The Toyon II boys got
a little excited under the strain
of big league competition and
showed plenty of spirit (?) in
trying to keep Sher and Co. from
bunting them silly. Walking only
five batsmen, Sher struck out four
teen (14) batters and faced only
25 men during the course of the
game.
"Iron" Joe also led the victors
hitting attack with three hits in four
trips to the plate, and Rex Alsup
came through with two bingles. With
the return of Bob Rosburg the "In
dependents" should be stronger than
ever before and probably will go
on to win the Championship hands
down.
Although playing with only sev
en men, Tyler Hall, by virtue of
a big first inning in which they
scored six runs, downed the new
ly formed Toyon I squad in what
proved to be a slow game. Willie
"Slugger" Davis amazed all con
cerned when he collected four
hits in five trips to the platter—
more hits than he got all spring
quarter. Secret—Willie is one of
the clean living !M) per cent.
On the Toyon side of the score
book, clean up man Birk, the only
one with a beard on the entire squad,
collected three for three, but the
best man on the squad seemed to
be the third baseman who made
some sensational plays. Suffice it
to say that his name does not ap
pear here because of the fact that
we do not know what it is.
Because of the manpower short
age at the Firehouse the leagues
have now been combined into one,
and a round-robin schedule of
eight games will be played and
our prediction remains as before.
•'lndependents," Tyler, Arthur,
and the Med. School in the first
division with a cellar battle be
tween the two Toyon outfits.
