# Phelps Wins Initial Tilt
## 
### 
Our Stanford boys playing under
the banner of Phelps-Terkel came
through in their first game in the
Palo Alto Night Softball League
when they walloped a third place
Southern Pacific ten by a score oi
9-3. In the process of doing this
they collected 13 hits with nearly
everyone getting a fair share of
glory.
In his usual manner, Joe Shei
rang up a slue of strikeouts ana
had his rise ball rising to perfec
tion, gave only eight scattered hits
and whiffed the last three men tc
face him. All this came after hii
no hit, no run performance in Ih{
intramural league Tuesday after
noon.
In the field, Ric Supple turned
in a couple of fielding gems thai
deserve acclaim, although the out
fielders might have pitched a teni
and roasted hot dogs and marsh
mallows for all the business they
handled during the game. Hitting
power was not lacking and the bqys
took new confidence when they
scored two runs in the second anc
took a lead which they never lost
We are in agreement with the
Palo Alto Times when they pre
dict that the Phelps-Terkel teairv
will be up there at the top come
the end of the second half of the
competition, and we hope that there
will be more Stanford rooters dt)wi
there at the games to back up the
squad.
