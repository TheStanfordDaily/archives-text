LP FRONT, by Bill Mauldin.
New York: Henry Holt & Co. $3.00.
"The vast majority of combat men
are going to be no problem at all.
They are so damned sick and tired
of having their noses rubbed in a
stinking war that their only ambi
tion will be to forget it."
This is Bill Mauldin talking and
that sentence is characteristic of
him, of his sincerity and brevity.
Whether he talks about rations, dec
orations, mail, or the medics he
does it in this manner. He tells
the story of the guy with the rifle
better than it has ever been told.
Far transcending its practical value
of providing understanding of com
bat men, the book is one of those
rare instances where worthwnile
things are said in a worthwhile way.
Many persons wonder what front

to express it. Correspondents at
tempt it continually, with varying
degrees of failure; novelists will
attempt it for decades to come, but

fought with the infantry, a man
who has been a part of it in every
respect, can fully understand it. Bill
Mauldin is one of them. His car
toons of Joe and Willie, the two un
shaven and weary doughboys, are
the truest characterizations of the
war. They aren't always very

them to be: "Maybe I can be funny
after the war," he writes, "but no
body who has seen this war can be
cute about it while it's going on."
T here are no jokes about
sergeants or WACs, instead there
is Willie, ducking for cover and
panting to Joe: "I made it. I owe
ya another fifty bucks." The weari
ness, the holes, the mud. the clothes,
the uncertainty, the empty stomachs
—the kind of war that is not very
real even a few hundred yards be
hind the lines is in his cartoons.
They do not simplify in the cheap
pseudo-patriotic fashion of the
movies, nor do they express the
disillusioned hopelessness so typical
of the work of many artists after
the last war.
It is a pleasant surprise to find
that Mauldin can write almost as
