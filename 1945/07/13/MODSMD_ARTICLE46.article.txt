LP FRONT, by Bill Mauldin.
New York: Henry Holt & Co. $3.00.
"The vast majority of combat men
are going to be no problem at all.
They are so damned sick and tired
of having their noses rubbed in a
stinking war that their only ambi
tion will be to forget it."
This is Bill Mauldin talking and
that sentence is characteristic of
him, of his sincerity and brevity.
Whether he talks about rations, dec
orations, mail, or the medics he
does it in this manner. He tells
the story of the guy with the rifle
better than it has ever been told.
Far transcending its practical value
of providing understanding of com
bat men, the book is one of those
rare instances where worthwnile
things are said in a worthwhile way.
Many persons wonder what front
line life means; many have tried
to express it. Correspondents at
tempt it continually, with varying
degrees of failure; novelists will
attempt it for decades to come, but
only a man who has lived and
fought with the infantry, a man
who has been a part of it in every
respect, can fully understand it. Bill
Mauldin is one of them. His car
toons of Joe and Willie, the two un
shaven and weary doughboys, are
the truest characterizations of the
war. They aren't always very
amusing—Mauldin does nob want
them to be: "Maybe I can be funny
after the war," he writes, "but no
body who has seen this war can be
cute about it while it's going on."
T here are no jokes about
sergeants or WACs, instead there
is Willie, ducking for cover and
panting to Joe: "I made it. I owe
ya another fifty bucks." The weari
ness, the holes, the mud. the clothes,
the uncertainty, the empty stomachs
—the kind of war that is not very
real even a few hundred yards be
hind the lines is in his cartoons.
They do not simplify in the cheap
pseudo-patriotic fashion of the
movies, nor do they express the
disillusioned hopelessness so typical
of the work of many artists after
the last war.
It is a pleasant surprise to find
that Mauldin can write almost as
well as he can draw. He knows his
limitations, and, to one who has
been "up front," his words seem
primarily commentaries on and am
plifications of his pictures. The same
ideas are emphasized in both. This
is a great help to the many who
haven't been in the infantry, for
while to them the cartoons may
sometimes seem difficult to under
stand, the words are certainly in
telligible. Like the cartoons they are
invaluable for their simplicity and
their ability to make a point. The
artificially simple speeches of cellu
loid heroes also attempt to express
something important, but generally
they express nothing that can be
remembered the next day. Anyone
who reads Mauldin without taking
it to heart may just as well have
stayed illiterate.
Life in our generation hasn't
made much sense and art has often
followed suit. Mauldin makes lots
of sense and might therefore not
be appreciated, particularly by the
ladies who want Joe to shave and
wear a crease in his pants when
killing Germans. However, he will
be greatly appreciated by those who
know that everything in the world
isn't black or white, and that it has
neither the simplicity of Alger nor
the neurotic complexity of D. H.
Lawrence.

degrees of failure; novelists will
attempt it for decades to come, but
only a man who has lived and
fought with the infantry, a man
who has been a part of it in every
respect, can fully understand it. Bill
Mauldin is one of them. His car
toons of Joe and Willie, the two un
shaven and weary doughboys, are
the truest characterizations of the
war. They aren't always very
amusing—Mauldin does nob want

cute about it while it's going on."
T here are no jokes about

of the work of many artists after

It is a pleasant surprise to find
that Mauldin can write almost as

limitations, and, to one who has
been "up front," his words seem
primarily commentaries on and am

ideas are emphasized in both. This
is a great help to the many who

invaluable for their simplicity and
their ability to make a point. The
artificially simple speeches of cellu

something important, but generally
they express nothing that can be
remembered the next day. Anyone
who reads Mauldin without taking
it to heart may just as well have
stayed illiterate.
Life in our generation hasn't
made much sense and art has often
followed suit. Mauldin makes lots
of sense and might therefore not
be appreciated, particularly by the
ladies who want Joe to shave and
wear a crease in his pants when
killing Germans. However, he will
be greatly appreciated by those who
know that everything in the world
isn't black or white, and that it has
neither the simplicity of Alger nor
the neurotic complexity of D. H.

LP FRONT, by Bill Mauldin.
New York: Henry Holt & Co. $3.00.
"The vast majority of combat men
are going to be no problem at all.
They are so damned sick and tired
of having their noses rubbed in a
stinking war that their only ambi
tion will be to forget it."
This is Bill Mauldin talking and
that sentence is characteristic of
him, of his sincerity and brevity.
Whether he talks about rations, dec
orations, mail, or the medics he
does it in this manner. He tells
the story of the guy with the rifle
better than it has ever been told.
Far transcending its practical value
of providing understanding of com
bat men, the book is one of those
rare instances where worthwnile
things are said in a worthwhile way.
