### GEORGE BRUNN 
"Stanford has been proposed by
many conference delegates as site
for the world organization," says
Dr. Jose Sanson, graduate student.
Sanson participated in the confer
ence as private secretary to Dr.
Sacasa, Nicaraguan ambassador to
Washington and head of the Nica
raguan delegation.
In private discussions among the
delegates various suggestions were
made for a United Nations capital,
among them The Hague and Geneva.
San Francisco was frequently sug
gested. with special emphasis on the
Stanford campus.
Hoover Library
The choice of the university
would be a wise one, Sanson be
lieves. enabling ihe representatives
to make use of such facilities as
the Hoover library and to work in
pleasant surroundings. It would al
so be good for Stanford whose pres
tige would be tremendously in
creased. It would provide students
"with an unprecedented chance to
acquire knowledge of the theoretic
al and practical aspects of inter
national politics."
Sanson is appealing to Dr.
Tresidder, the Board of Trustees,
the students and benefactors of the
university, and to all Californians
to start an organized campaign to
wards this end. "We must start im
mediately." he maintains. "With
our help and support the scholars
and diplomats that love Stanford
can easily show the world the ad
vantages of making the campus
United Nations headquarters."
Reeducation in Europe
Europe is vanquished, hungry and
destroyed. The jobs to be done there
are reconstruction and reeducation.
In order to secure a free develop
ment of the people's rights in in
ternational machinery must be lo
cated in the hemisphere of freedom,
according to Sanson. "America (and
I mean the entire continent of Co
lumbus) is the champion of the new
cf'a and must be the center of the
future peace-keeping mechanism.
Already San Francisco gave the
world a charter and Stanford will
give peace to humanity."
Giving his impressions of the con
ference. Sanson believes that never
in history have so many nations and

sincere representatives worked to
gether. He is worried about the
problem of veto power because to
him it contains the key to future
peace. "Nevertheless," he says,"I
trust the good will of the big na
tions, whose people are tired of
war and wish a new life with the
four freedoms as creed."
Rockefeller's Message
In San Francisco he talked to a
number of leading diplomats, in
cluding Nelson A. Rockefeller, As
sistant Secretary of State, who im
pressed him as the greatest living
friend of the Latin Americas. Rocke
feller gave Jose a message affirm
ing unity and goodwill to transmit
to the people of Nicaragua.
Sanson studies economics and in
ternational law here under a State
Department scholarship. He re
ceived his doctor-of-laws degree in
1943 at Managua, Nicaragua, and held
positions there as criminal judge
and head of the Department of the
Interior offices. After completing
his studies here he expects to re
turn to government work in his
country.
