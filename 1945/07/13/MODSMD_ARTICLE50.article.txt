Your attention is called to the
l'act that in the May 24, 1945 issue
of the Stanford Daily there appeared
an article entitled, "Molotov, Stan
ford Carillon. Topics of 'New York
er' Pun; Lawson Describes Chimes."
One paragraph of this article reads
as "oilows:
"In the Mission Inn at .River
side, California, is a ♦ourth
pseudo-carillon built by the J. C.
Deagan Company, manufacturers
of door bells. Their product con
sists of elongated vibrating tin
cans which can be amplified "rom
church belfries. The Deagan
pany incorrectly calls these tin
cans 'carillons'
We have been informed by the
J. C. Deagan Company that the
foregoing statements are absolutely
incorrect. We have been informed
by the J. C. Deagan Company that
the true facts of the matter are as
follows:
"The Deagan Company is in its
66th year of business and is the
world's largest manufacturer of
tower bells, chimes, carillons, and
other percussive musical instru
ments. The Deagan Company has
never manufactured "door bells."
"As defined in Webster's New
International Dictionary, a bell is
"a hollow metallic vessel .... liv
ing forth a ringing sound on be
ing struck' and a carillon is 'a set
of bells played by machinery OK
by finger keys'. Thus the instru
ment which the Deagan Company
installed in the Mission Inn at
Riverside, California, is a carillon
in every sense of the word, since
it is composed of bells, and mel
odies are played on it BOTH by
'machinery' and by 'finger keys'."
"Far from being 'vibrating tin
cans,' the bells of the Mission Inn
Carillon are constructed of the
finest bell metal and are guaran
teed for 99 years. The carillon
contains 25 bells, with a range
of two actaves, from C to C, chro
matic. The bells are played both
manually from an electric con
sole and automatically from a
Deagan Electric Player which
utilizes perforated music rolls.
"Deagan tower bells have in
themselves sufficient volume, car
rying power and richness of tone,
as to make unnecessary any arti
ficial or synthetic build-up. Thus
Deagan tower bolls are never
'amplified from church belfries'."
"For more than sixty years the
Deagan Company has been rec
ognized as the world's leading au
thority on matters pertaining to
tone, tuning, musical pitch and
acoustics. Deagan bells have been
acclaimed by such world-famous
musical authorities as Dr. Leo
pold Stokowski, Dr. Walter Dam
rosh. Percy Grainger, the late Dr.
Frederick Stock. Erno Rapee, the
late John Philip Sousa and many
others.
"The list of hundreds of pur
chasers of Deagan bells includes
such names as Walter P. Chrysler,
Pierre S. du Pone. James Ward

Packard, William Wrigley, Jr.,
Rodman Wanamaker, Mrs. E. L.
Doheny, R. B. Bennett, former
Premier of Canada, and many
others of prominence, affluence
and discernment."
The quoted remarks of Mr. Law
son should not be understood as an
expression of the views of this
newspaper or of the University.
Mr. Lawson has no authority to
speak for the University, which sin
cerely regrets this incident and
offers its apologies to the Deagan
Company. Any criticism, expressed

drawn and retracted.

Your attention is called to the
l'act that in the May 24, 1945 issue

an article entitled, "Molotov, Stan

One paragraph of this article reads
as "oilows:
"In the Mission Inn at .River
side, California, is a ♦ourth
pseudo-carillon built by the J. C.
Deagan Company, manufacturers
of door bells. Their product con
sists of elongated vibrating tin
cans which can be amplified "rom
church belfries. The Deagan
pany incorrectly calls these tin
cans 'carillons'
We have been informed by the
J. C. Deagan Company that the
foregoing statements are absolutely
incorrect. We have been informed
by the J. C. Deagan Company that
the true facts of the matter are as
follows:
"The Deagan Company is in its
66th year of business and is the
world's largest manufacturer of
tower bells, chimes, carillons, and
other percussive musical instru
ments. The Deagan Company has
never manufactured "door bells."
"As defined in Webster's New
International Dictionary, a bell is
"a hollow metallic vessel .... liv
ing forth a ringing sound on be
ing struck' and a carillon is 'a set
of bells played by machinery OK
by finger keys'. Thus the instru
ment which the Deagan Company
installed in the Mission Inn at
Riverside, California, is a carillon
in every sense of the word, since
it is composed of bells, and mel
odies are played on it BOTH by
'machinery' and by 'finger keys'."
"Far from being 'vibrating tin
cans,' the bells of the Mission Inn
Carillon are constructed of the
finest bell metal and are guaran
teed for 99 years. The carillon
contains 25 bells, with a range
of two actaves, from C to C, chro
matic. The bells are played both
manually from an electric con
sole and automatically from a
Deagan Electric Player which
utilizes perforated music rolls.
"Deagan tower bells have in
themselves sufficient volume, car
rying power and richness of tone,
as to make unnecessary any arti
ficial or synthetic build-up. Thus
Deagan tower bolls are never
'amplified from church belfries'."
"For more than sixty years the
Deagan Company has been rec
ognized as the world's leading au
thority on matters pertaining to
tone, tuning, musical pitch and
acoustics. Deagan bells have been
acclaimed by such world-famous
musical authorities as Dr. Leo
pold Stokowski, Dr. Walter Dam
rosh. Percy Grainger, the late Dr.
Frederick Stock. Erno Rapee, the
late John Philip Sousa and many
others.
"The list of hundreds of pur
chasers of Deagan bells includes
such names as Walter P. Chrysler,
