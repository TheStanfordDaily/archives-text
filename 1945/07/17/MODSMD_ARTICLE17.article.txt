And now let's talk about the missing slot machines
in San Mateo County. It seems that the vice crusaders
of the Bay area, headed by the San Francisco News,
are staging another one of those futile clean-up cam
paigns, and at the present time the gambling elements
jf our neighboring county are taking an enforced rest.
But in a month or so we'll be hearing the metallic
'clak. clak, clak" of the machines again and all the
talk about "vice in San Mateo County" will be just
a memory. And the crusaders can go back into their
shells again, to reappear at the next election.
In the meantime, if you want to make a barrel of
money, there's a little horse named "Slappy" running
in the Bth at Del Mar today. From one horseman to
another, it "can't miss."
