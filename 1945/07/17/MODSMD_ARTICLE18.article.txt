### CYCLONE COVEY 
BRING ON THE GIRLS, now playing at the Stan
ford, has got a number of excellent entertainment se
quences, among them Sonny Tuft's rendition of "I'm

Gonna Hate Myself in the Morn
ing" and Spike Jones' band-riot
takeoff on "Chloe."
And it shows up the bulk of Hol
lywood's technicolor musical come
dies.
Still, it itself is shown up by a
comparison with say, Two Girls
and a Sailor. This time it is two
sailors and a girl, though one of the
sailors is a millionaire again.
Hollywood does not seem quite
to discover how to make a musical

comedy which utilizes points of departure other than
gold diggers, night-club floor shows, and Miami swim
ming pools. And the failing of this picture, in spite
,)f Sonny Tufts, is that it insists on reverting to the
superficial stereotype.

BETRAYAL FROM THE EAST is a special case.
Its worst mistake is the bad taste of its being in
roduced and concluded with a lecture by Drew Pear
son. Then aside from bad taste, it creates the impres
sion through Pearson that the picture is based alto
gether on fact, even though it was taken from a novel.
One of the "facts" portrayed is that a Japanese
student at Stanford was a cheer leader and connected
vith a spy ring in this country. In one scene he is
shown flanked by two scantily-clad female assistants

leading a yell at the 1941 U.C.L.A. game, which the
picture has played at Los Angeles though it was
played here that year.
Now in the first place, Dean Yost would never
permit those women assistants to yell without their
long stockings on. And in the second place, Stan
ford had no Japanese cheer leaders. There were
Nisei on Rallycom, but they have done the U. S. no
harm. There was a Japanese naval officer years ago
who was caught buying documents from a sailor, but
(its being peace-time) he was told to go back to
Japan. He was registered as a graduate student and
did not lead yells. Reports at various times have
claimed that certain Japanese soldiers were once
Stanford students, but on being traced they were
found never to have been registered here. All along
the Coast, colleges have had students from Japan
who had been required to have the usual compulsory
military training in Japan, and there was some es
pionage activity reported among Japanese at U.C.L.A.;
but so far as is known at Stanford, no Stanford Jap
anese students native or alien, have conspired against
the United States.
Betrayal from the East however has its good points.
One is that it makes a sincere attempt not to glamor
ize. Of course, since Hollywood has not had much ex
perience at telling the truth, it fumbles here and there.
But on the whole, it is a surprising effort and ought
to be commended.

roduced and concluded with a lecture by Drew Pear
son. Then aside from bad taste, it creates the impres
sion through Pearson that the picture is based alto
gether on fact, even though it was taken from a novel.
One of the "facts" portrayed is that a Japanese
student at Stanford was a cheer leader and connected
vith a spy ring in this country. In one scene he is
shown flanked by two scantily-clad female assistants

leading a yell at the 1941 U.C.L.A. game, which the
picture has played at Los Angeles though it was
played here that year.
Now in the first place, Dean Yost would never
permit those women assistants to yell without their
long stockings on. And in the second place, Stan
ford had no Japanese cheer leaders. There were
Nisei on Rallycom, but they have done the U. S. no
harm. There was a Japanese naval officer years ago
who was caught buying documents from a sailor, but
(its being peace-time) he was told to go back to
Japan. He was registered as a graduate student and
did not lead yells. Reports at various times have
claimed that certain Japanese soldiers were once
Stanford students, but on being traced they were
found never to have been registered here. All along
the Coast, colleges have had students from Japan
who had been required to have the usual compulsory
military training in Japan, and there was some es
pionage activity reported among Japanese at U.C.L.A.;
but so far as is known at Stanford, no Stanford Jap
anese students native or alien, have conspired against
the United States.
Betrayal from the East however has its good points.
One is that it makes a sincere attempt not to glamor
ize. Of course, since Hollywood has not had much ex
perience at telling the truth, it fumbles here and there.
But on the whole, it is a surprising effort and ought
to be commended.

BRING ON THE GIRLS, now playing at the Stan
ford, has got a number of excellent entertainment se
quences, among them Sonny Tuft's rendition of "I'm

Gonna Hate Myself in the Morn
ing" and Spike Jones' band-riot
takeoff on "Chloe."
And it shows up the bulk of Hol
lywood's technicolor musical come
dies.
Still, it itself is shown up by a
comparison with say, Two Girls
and a Sailor. This time it is two
sailors and a girl, though one of the
sailors is a millionaire again.
Hollywood does not seem quite
to discover how to make a musical

comedy which utilizes points of departure other than
gold diggers, night-club floor shows, and Miami swim
ming pools. And the failing of this picture, in spite
,)f Sonny Tufts, is that it insists on reverting to the
superficial stereotype.
