### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
TRUSTEESHIPS
The Trusteeships Committees troubles revolved
around Commander Stassen's draft. He wrote that
every power holding trusteed peoples should try to
develop the self-government of those peoples. How
ever many nations said that this phrasing was not
enough, and demanded it be change to independence.
The opposition was led by General Romulo of the
Philippine Commonwealth, who proved himself an
able orator. A new paragraph, which went farther
than the old one, being a general declaration for all
nations holding colonies, stated that the High Con
tracting Parties would try to develop the political
aspirations of these peoples. Independence, however,
was left out of the draft.
