AST ECHOES
Four days after < the sensational debut of the new
army swing band, complimentary words are still heard
all over campus. We were very happy to observe
that the reactions of people present were all favorable.
When Bob Drasnin began to solo on "Stardust." that
fine Southern gentleman, "Dimples" Bunch was over
heard in his own inimitable way, drawling, "Ah
didn't reckon Artie Shaw was hyar tonight." When
leader Fleher took off on "Snowfall," it brought back
sweet memories of Ted Fio Rito to his foremost and
only disciple. Weaver O. Wyatt. To us. they measured
up to every expectation, and great things are predicted
for the crew in the future. And the future is not too
far distant because the band will be on hand again
next Friday night. Those of you who have not yet
been exposed to ihose beautiful tones will have your
opportunity then. Remember the dance is stag, so
let's have an all-campus turnout Friday at 8:30.
Who is the only section in Company "C" that was
not gigged last Saturday afternoon at the weekly army
"rest" period? Out of 200 men there were only 17 who
escaped the lieutenant's eye at the drill field. Our
hats are off to the only section who is constantly on
the ball and who is never guilty of the slightest in
fraction of any army regulationâ€”the infallible ME G's!
The senior Electrical Engineers have found that "all
work and no play make Jack a dull boy" is not true.
On the contrary, they enjoy staying in their rooms
in deep meditation over the countless problems that
arise in the complicated field of volts and amperes.
Night after night they burn the midnight oil in their
mad quest for knowledge. Most of us cannot conceive
of their eagerness: but there must be some reason for
it. Is it for the unique honor of receiving that coveted
buff pass? (over half of them made the GI dean's list).
Is it because the magic color of a good conduct ribbon
appeals to them? Or is it because they are bucking
for a seventh term? Rod Gaetz would like this be
cause that will mean three more ecstatic months with
Loretta. Krown wants it because fall quarter will
mean Sparky, and Sparky means Poison Oak . . . But
most of us are content to follow the Golden Rule,
"make hay while the sun shines." and let Andy
Racynski and his haloed angels go their merry (?)
way. . .
Miller and Moseman are now operating a non stop
run between Encina and the Palo Alto Copacabana.
Nightly at 10:30 a sleek black car stands alone on
the highway near Rossotti's while inside 8 or 9 somber
figures can be seen in deep meditation over the weighty
problems of the day. But the SEs's are not alone .
they are almost always accompanied by Papa's most
avid customers. Meemi. Baumeister. Meemi. Herman.
Meetni, Claude. Meemi. and of course Meerni.
