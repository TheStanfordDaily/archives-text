# CAMPUS OPINION

TO the Editor:
The term "International Tea-
Drinkers" which you used in your
editorial last Friday is misleading
and sort of on the facetious side.
You also jumped to a completely
false conclusion when you assumed
that the International Teas aimed
at taking over the work of the In
ternational Club. This is not so.
In originating the International
Teas, it was hoped that a precendent
could be established—a custom be
gun on campus—a particular time
during the afternoon when we could
gather at a stated place—dropping
in when and if we had the time,
knowing that there we would find
refreshments and interesting refresh
ment.
The stated aim in the origin of
these Teas was to bring about bet
ter mixing and understanding be
tween we who are natives of this
country and those students who
have come here from foreign lands.
And what better way to get ac
quainted than at a welcomed pause
in the afternoon's activities, over
uniting refreshment and in pleasant
surroundings?
Unfortunately for us, that period
of the afternoon at which such a
gathering is held, is known as Tea—
a blight—a curse upon the ears of
most Americans—a term denoting
stift' formality and a despised and
sissified drink to them.
Shall we forego the potential bene
fits of the establishment of such a
custom here at Stanford just be
cause of the obvious connotations
of the term which describes it? Per
haps a better title could be sug
gested for that afternoon interlude
and coffee or punch or chocolate
substituted for refreshment.
Are our intentions in the aim of
International Teas, as stated, im
practical and of no value to this
community?
Sincerely,
BILL SHEPHERD.

Dear Fellow-Student:
I had a fine opportunity to reflect
upon the problem of student trans
portation last night while walking
home into Palo Alto with my brief
case full of research papers dangling
from one hand instead of riding in
the basket on my bicycle.
I gave the subject further con
templation while walking out to the
campus today, and while spending
an hour or more looking all around
Palo Alto and the Campus for the
bicycle.
I have come to the unanimous
conclusion that you shouldn't have
done it. Or in plain terms, you
hadn't oughta of did it!
I base this conclusion on the fol
lowing assumptions:
1. The police department has not
time to monkey with this sort of
stuff during wartime. It is badly
understaffed to take care of such
trivial cases.
2. Stanford does not have a de
partment of criminology, therefore
you are not helping to train students
by such acts.
3. The Honor Code does not spe
cifically mention bikenapping. but
your example might lead someone
to be tempted to actually take a
Book from the Library, instead of a
bike from in front of it.
4. The time you saved, probably
2 minutes, does not equal the time
I lost: two hours.
5. In addition to getting educated
I have to take partial care of a
young daughter, so that actual hard

ship could easily have been the re
sult of this act.
6. If that's the kind of guys they
have at Sequoia, I may form a de
cided preference for one of the other
dormitories.
If you are the rich son of a con
scientious father, I would be glad
to accept the sum of $7.55 as full
damages. But I would by no means
be willing to have you do the same
thing again for this trifling amount.
It put me to far more inconven
ience and worry than that.
For further research on the sub
ject, secure Orbis Pictus by Comen
ius and gaze upon the picture en
titled The Annoyance of Malefac
tors. It shows burning at the stake,
etc.

TO the Editor:
The term "International Tea-
Drinkers" which you used in your
editorial last Friday is misleading
and sort of on the facetious side.
You also jumped to a completely
false conclusion when you assumed
that the International Teas aimed
at taking over the work of the In
ternational Club. This is not so.
In originating the International
Teas, it was hoped that a precendent
could be established—a custom be
gun on campus—a particular time
during the afternoon when we could
gather at a stated place—dropping
in when and if we had the time,
knowing that there we would find
refreshments and interesting refresh
ment.
The stated aim in the origin of
these Teas was to bring about bet
ter mixing and understanding be
tween we who are natives of this
country and those students who
have come here from foreign lands.
And what better way to get ac
quainted than at a welcomed pause
in the afternoon's activities, over
uniting refreshment and in pleasant
surroundings?
Unfortunately for us, that period
of the afternoon at which such a
gathering is held, is known as Tea—
a blight—a curse upon the ears of
most Americans—a term denoting
stift' formality and a despised and
sissified drink to them.
Shall we forego the potential bene
fits of the establishment of such a
custom here at Stanford just be
cause of the obvious connotations
of the term which describes it? Per
haps a better title could be sug
gested for that afternoon interlude
and coffee or punch or chocolate
substituted for refreshment.
Are our intentions in the aim of
International Teas, as stated, im
practical and of no value to this
community?

Dear Fellow-Student:
I had a fine opportunity to reflect
upon the problem of student trans
portation last night while walking
home into Palo Alto with my brief
case full of research papers dangling
from one hand instead of riding in
the basket on my bicycle.
I gave the subject further con
templation while walking out to the
campus today, and while spending
an hour or more looking all around
Palo Alto and the Campus for the
bicycle.
I have come to the unanimous
conclusion that you shouldn't have
done it. Or in plain terms, you
hadn't oughta of did it!
I base this conclusion on the fol
lowing assumptions:
1. The police department has not
time to monkey with this sort of
stuff during wartime. It is badly
understaffed to take care of such
trivial cases.
2. Stanford does not have a de
partment of criminology, therefore
you are not helping to train students
by such acts.
3. The Honor Code does not spe
cifically mention bikenapping. but
your example might lead someone
to be tempted to actually take a
Book from the Library, instead of a
bike from in front of it.
4. The time you saved, probably
2 minutes, does not equal the time
I lost: two hours.
5. In addition to getting educated
I have to take partial care of a
young daughter, so that actual hard

ship could easily have been the re
sult of this act.
6. If that's the kind of guys they
have at Sequoia, I may form a de
cided preference for one of the other
dormitories.
If you are the rich son of a con
scientious father, I would be glad
to accept the sum of $7.55 as full
damages. But I would by no means
be willing to have you do the same
thing again for this trifling amount.
It put me to far more inconven
ience and worry than that.
