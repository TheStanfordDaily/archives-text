# Bailey Writes on Wilson: Hopes for Avoiding Old Errors in New Peace
## 
### DOT ESCHERICH 
In order to point out the mistakes
made by the peacemakers of World
War I. so that this second peace
and world organization may be more
enduring, Thomas A. Bailey, Pro
fessor of History, has written his
second book on another wartime
president, "Woodrow Wilson and the
Great Betrayal."
This book takes up the story
where his "Woodrow Wilson and
he Lost Peace" ended. It tells of
the years of 1919 and 1920, after
Wilson returned from the Paris
Peace Conference, and the failure
of the Senate to ratify the Treaty
of Versailles.
Hearst Blamed
Professor Bailey blames the op
position of the German-American
and other national groups, Hearst's
and other newspapers' powerful
campaigns, blind antagonism of Re
publican forces, a few influential
wealthy men, and a general mis
understanding on the part of the
American people as contributing to
the "betrayal" of the ideals and
pledges of Wilson for which son
many of the nation's youth died.
Wilson himself, says Professor
Bailey, was at fault in that he re
fused to compromise in his demands.
"It would have been far better,"
he said, "if Wilson had given in on
some points and tried later, after
the League was in operation, to
rectify them." The tragic collapse
of Wilson during his western tour
may have been partly responsible
for his stubborn attitude.
"I had intended, in a small way,

to prepare public opinion for this
peaces with this book," said Pro
fessor Bailey. "But they reversed
the order which I had expected by
making the charter before the peace
settlements, instead of after." How
ever, the second book was released
in June about the same time that
President Truman presented the
United Nations charter to the sen
ate, making it very timely for a
comparison between the proceed
ings of both wars.
The progress of the San Fran
cisco conference went even better
than Professor Bailey anticipated it
would, although he pointed out that
he "expected more of a scrap in
the Senate than apparently will
come, "He does think, though, that
there will be a wide variety of dis

senting opinion on the committing
of the United States armed forces
to war against future aggressions.
Three Year Preparation
The two books were originally
intended as one volume, but he
realized that this would be too large,
as well as making the first book,
published a year ago, less timely.
Three years of immediate prepar
ation went into the two Wilson
books, but Professor Bailey's entire
life has been a preparation for he
has been studying Wilson for about
20 years in his special field of
American Diplomatic History.
The June 30 issue of "The Satur
day Review of Literature" has on
its front cover a picture of the
Stanford professor in connection
with,a review of his newest book.

This book takes up the story
where his "Woodrow Wilson and
he Lost Peace" ended. It tells of
the years of 1919 and 1920, after
Wilson returned from the Paris
Peace Conference, and the failure
of the Senate to ratify the Treaty
of Versailles.
Hearst Blamed
Professor Bailey blames the op
position of the German-American
and other national groups, Hearst's
and other newspapers' powerful
campaigns, blind antagonism of Re
publican forces, a few influential
wealthy men, and a general mis
understanding on the part of the
American people as contributing to
the "betrayal" of the ideals and
pledges of Wilson for which son
many of the nation's youth died.
Wilson himself, says Professor
Bailey, was at fault in that he re
fused to compromise in his demands.
"It would have been far better,"
he said, "if Wilson had given in on
some points and tried later, after
the League was in operation, to
rectify them." The tragic collapse
of Wilson during his western tour
may have been partly responsible
for his stubborn attitude.
"I had intended, in a small way,

to prepare public opinion for this
peaces with this book," said Pro
fessor Bailey. "But they reversed
the order which I had expected by
making the charter before the peace
settlements, instead of after." How
ever, the second book was released
in June about the same time that
President Truman presented the
United Nations charter to the sen
ate, making it very timely for a
comparison between the proceed
ings of both wars.
The progress of the San Fran
cisco conference went even better
than Professor Bailey anticipated it
would, although he pointed out that
he "expected more of a scrap in
the Senate than apparently will
come, "He does think, though, that
there will be a wide variety of dis

senting opinion on the committing
of the United States armed forces
to war against future aggressions.
Three Year Preparation
The two books were originally
intended as one volume, but he
realized that this would be too large,
as well as making the first book,
published a year ago, less timely.
Three years of immediate prepar
ation went into the two Wilson
books, but Professor Bailey's entire
life has been a preparation for he
has been studying Wilson for about
20 years in his special field of
American Diplomatic History.
The June 30 issue of "The Satur
day Review of Literature" has on
its front cover a picture of the
Stanford professor in connection
with,a review of his newest book.
In order to point out the mistakes
made by the peacemakers of World
War I. so that this second peace
and world organization may be more
enduring, Thomas A. Bailey, Pro

Great Betrayal."
