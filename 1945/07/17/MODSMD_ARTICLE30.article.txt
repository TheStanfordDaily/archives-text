### BOB SLOBE 
A new and sensational figure in
the eyes of American baseball fans
is Tommy Holmes, slugging right
fielder of the Boston Braves. He has
been the man to beat all season for
all around offensive ability in both
of the major leagues.
Always a great batter, Holmes
has been uhic to maintain a batting
average of around 400 and may
even finish out the season in the
select circle of "above 400 hit
ters," which includes: Ty Cobb,
Rogers Ilornsby, and Ted Wil
liams. Aside from his average in
batting. Holmes has been able to
maintain his lead in runs batted
in, runs scored, and a second in
homeruns.
His name will now take its place
in the National League baseball rec
ords, for last week he broke Horns
by's consecutive game batting rec
ord when he hit in 37 straight con
tests and was finally halted on his
way to Joe Di Maggio's 5G game
record by Henry Wyse of the Chi
cago Cubs, who blanked him in four
times at bat. Tommy's big day came
when he tied the "Rajah's" record
during a double header and in the
meantime collected three homeruns,
two doubles and a single in ten
trips to raise his batting average
over the . 400 mark.
If he is able to continue his
terrific pace, he will no doubt be
chosen as the National League's
most valuable player.

One boy on his way up to the
big leagues is Bob Joyce, ace San
Francisco hurler. Bobby has al
ready won 20 games this year
against a mere six losses this year
season is only a little over half
finished. It may even be that lie
will win .'JO contests this season
even though he will be pitching
against some though teams. If he
does achieve this feat, he will he
the first one to turn the trick in
the Pacific Coast League since
Louis "Buck" Newsome topped
the league in 1934.
There are several reasons for
Joyce's success. One is that he in
spires confidence with his coolness,
which make his team hit for him.
Another is that he is a slugger who
is capable of wielding a potent stick
and has often been used in pinch
hitting roles. In winning his twen
tieth victory he batted two for three
including a homerun which made
for the one run margin in his 5-4
victory. Joyce is indeed a valuable
man to the Seals, for he has won
20 games out of the 55 that the
Seals have copped this year — not
bad when you consider the Seals
have 5 or G other pitchers to split
the remaining 35.

the league in 1934.
There are several reasons for
Joyce's success. One is that he in
spires confidence with his coolness,
which make his team hit for him.
Another is that he is a slugger who
is capable of wielding a potent stick
and has often been used in pinch
hitting roles. In winning his twen
tieth victory he batted two for three
including a homerun which made
for the one run margin in his 5-4
victory. Joyce is indeed a valuable
man to the Seals, for he has won
20 games out of the 55 that the
Seals have copped this year — not
bad when you consider the Seals
have 5 or G other pitchers to split
the remaining 35.
A new and sensational figure in
the eyes of American baseball fans
is Tommy Holmes, slugging right
fielder of the Boston Braves. He has
been the man to beat all season for
all around offensive ability in both
of the major leagues.
Always a great batter, Holmes
has been uhic to maintain a batting
average of around 400 and may
even finish out the season in the
select circle of "above 400 hit
ters," which includes: Ty Cobb,
Rogers Ilornsby, and Ted Wil
liams. Aside from his average in
batting. Holmes has been able to
maintain his lead in runs batted
in, runs scored, and a second in
homeruns.
His name will now take its place
in the National League baseball rec
ords, for last week he broke Horns
by's consecutive game batting rec
ord when he hit in 37 straight con
tests and was finally halted on his
way to Joe Di Maggio's 5G game
record by Henry Wyse of the Chi
cago Cubs, who blanked him in four
times at bat. Tommy's big day came
when he tied the "Rajah's" record
during a double header and in the
meantime collected three homeruns,
two doubles and a single in ten
trips to raise his batting average
over the . 400 mark.
If he is able to continue his
terrific pace, he will no doubt be
chosen as the National League's
most valuable player.

One boy on his way up to the
big leagues is Bob Joyce, ace San
Francisco hurler. Bobby has al
ready won 20 games this year
against a mere six losses this year
season is only a little over half
finished. It may even be that lie
will win .'JO contests this season
even though he will be pitching
against some though teams. If he
does achieve this feat, he will he
the first one to turn the trick in
the Pacific Coast League since
Louis "Buck" Newsome topped
the league in 1934.
