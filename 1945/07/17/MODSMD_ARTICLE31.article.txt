# Phelps, 'Cards' Vie Tomorrow
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
The Phelps-Terkel ten will begin
their official league schedule when
they tackle the Redwood City Card
inals, the squad that won the first
half ot the Palo Alto Softball League
with a record of seven wins and
three losses. The Phelps opponents
are a group of Sequoia High school
boys, who are noted for their base
running and hustle.
The Phelps team made up of
Stanford boys walloped Mikes, the
winner of the "B" division, by a
score of IG-7 last Thursday. They
climbed on two of Mike's pitch
ers for a grand total of 17 base
hits, 11 of which came in the
big fourth when they amassed 11
runs on ten hits, seven consecu
tively. Joe Sher just "lobbed"
them in and gave up only 8
bingles; it seemed as though he
was saving his strength for the
two singles and a triple that he
collected. Doc Mason also starred
at bat for the victors.
Probable starting lineup for to
morrow's game: Doc Mason, catch
er; Joe Sher, pitcher; Dick Crane,
first base; Ted Morrison, second
base; Ric Supple, third base; Bob
Rosburg, short stop; Rex Alsup,
left field; Bob Slobe, center field;
Bonny Sugar, right field; and Don
Bechter, short field.
The game will be played on the
El Camino diamond and it begins
at 7:30.
