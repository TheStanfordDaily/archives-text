FROM THE MORNING MAILBAG
It is not our habit to read other people's mail,
but the following letter from Pat Hendrickson,
acting president of the Cal student body, to
A.S.S.U. President Bob Kennedy is different.
This letter is not just a letter from president
to president; it is a letter —an agreement, if you
will—between two universities. As an impor
tant part of one of these institutions—Stanford—
it should interest YOU:
"President, Associated Students of
Stanford University:
"We sincerely appreciate the fine spirit of co
operation demonstrated by your student officers
in making the trip to our campus in order to
tully discuss and attempt to clarify the situation
brought about by the unnecessary incident of
the Axe raid.
"It is fully realized that this raid made by six
California men was unjustified in view of the
existing agreement. We hope that you will ac
cept our sincere apologies for their thoughtless
and unnecessary act. Ignorance is no excuse,
but as the agreement was unknown to them the
raid seemed to them to have little more impor
tance than a demonstration of college spirit.
"However, we are fully cognizant of the sig
nificance of the situation and the detrimental ef
fects that it or any further such acts could have
upon the fine spirit of co-operation and good
will existing between the Stanford and Califor
nia campuses. The incident has brought to light
the necessity for giving the almost unknown
agreement existing between the two universities
regarding such raid extensive publicity. By thus
doing we hope to insure continued and harmo
nious relations between the student bodies of
Stanford University and the University of Cali
fornia.
"Very sincerely yours,
"Acting President, A.S.U.C."

AN ASIDE TO A FEW SPIRITED STANFORD
MEN WITH INTENTIONS OF PAINT
ING THE "C" RED
Of course you are red with rage over the at
tempted Axe removal. Of course you are will
ing to display your Stanford Spirit by avenging
this attempted theft.
But remember that you aren't the only Farm
students whose memories scarcely go back to
the "good ole days" of bonfires and Big Game
rallies—the days when that same Stanford Spirit
could be seen as well as felt. Yes, there are 854
other undergraduate students here this summer
who would just as willingly continue the feud
with Cal. But they only have "A" books.
And because of their limitation they (along
with Army and graduate students who are seek
ing a part in this same Spirit) have planned an
all-campus gathering at which they intend to
display — and loudly — their feeling for Farm
rheers and Farm songs.
These spirit-seeking Indians are staying away
from Cal and Bear banners tomorrow night in
tavor of our own little red boathouse and barbe
:ue pit.
They can't promise you any red paint but
they can Red Spirit.

AN ASIDE TO A FEW SPIRITED STANFORD
MEN WITH INTENTIONS OF PAINT
ING THE "C" RED
Of course you are red with rage over the at
tempted Axe removal. Of course you are will
ing to display your Stanford Spirit by avenging
this attempted theft.
But remember that you aren't the only Farm
students whose memories scarcely go back to
the "good ole days" of bonfires and Big Game
rallies—the days when that same Stanford Spirit
could be seen as well as felt. Yes, there are 854
other undergraduate students here this summer
who would just as willingly continue the feud
with Cal. But they only have "A" books.
And because of their limitation they (along
with Army and graduate students who are seek
ing a part in this same Spirit) have planned an
all-campus gathering at which they intend to
display — and loudly — their feeling for Farm
rheers and Farm songs.
These spirit-seeking Indians are staying away
from Cal and Bear banners tomorrow night in
tavor of our own little red boathouse and barbe
:ue pit.
They can't promise you any red paint but
they can Red Spirit.
FROM THE MORNING MAILBAG
It is not our habit to read other people's mail,
but the following letter from Pat Hendrickson,
acting president of the Cal student body, to
A.S.S.U. President Bob Kennedy is different.
This letter is not just a letter from president
to president; it is a letter —an agreement, if you
will—between two universities. As an impor
tant part of one of these institutions—Stanford—
it should interest YOU:
"President, Associated Students of
Stanford University:
"We sincerely appreciate the fine spirit of co
operation demonstrated by your student officers
in making the trip to our campus in order to
tully discuss and attempt to clarify the situation
brought about by the unnecessary incident of
the Axe raid.
"It is fully realized that this raid made by six
California men was unjustified in view of the
existing agreement. We hope that you will ac
cept our sincere apologies for their thoughtless
and unnecessary act. Ignorance is no excuse,
but as the agreement was unknown to them the
raid seemed to them to have little more impor
tance than a demonstration of college spirit.
"However, we are fully cognizant of the sig
