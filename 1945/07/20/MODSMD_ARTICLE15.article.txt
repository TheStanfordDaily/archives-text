The question of regional blocs was fought by
the Soviet delegation, but the Pan American
Union, reinforced by Chapultepec, and the Brit
ish Commonwealth of Nations were two such
blocs too strong to be ignored. Finally the
Soviet gave in, and some blocs were admitted
into the charter.
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL
The Economic and Social Council was
strengthened, and it was urged as something
to develop the standards of living and the hu
man rights of all the world. This went consid
erably farther than what was proposed at Dum
barton Oaks, but the provisions for the Council
are still, on the whole, vague.
Perhaps the quietest bit of work was that done
by the Commission on the World Court. This
commission quickly considered the work done
by the jurist group in Washington and passed it.
However, the new court is not mandatory, since
some nations not in the old one declared that
they could not safely guarantee that their peo
ples would accept it as such. Nevertheless, all
delegates promised to try to get it accepted as
mandatory, but their success remains to be seen.
CONCLUSIONS
The San Francisco Conference drafted a Char
ter that might be important, and might be just
a backwash in the tide of history. If the organi
zation becomes entangled in red tape and de
bates, or if nations decide that there is a policy
better than peace, then the whole thing might
fail. If, however, enlightened public opinion
stands behind it, the organization will succeed.
Public opinion kept the conference going over
many hurdles, and it, not the mechanism of
the Charter, will preserve the United Nations.
