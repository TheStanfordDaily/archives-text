### CYCLONE COVEY 
MORNING'S AT SEVEN, with A 1 Coburn. has yet
tonight, tomorrow and Monday to run in the Little
Theater.

It is a direct kind of comedy of
j serious implication which, though
neither hillarious nor spasmodic,
hits a steady absorption rate that
does not slightly relax.
Now you would perhaps prejudge
that the gossipy circumstances of
a group of aged neighbors would
provide no engrossing material for
a play intended to attain a high
absorption rate. But the play
wright. director, and cast, who are

Paul Osborn, John Sollers, and nine
Stanford Players respectively, here re-demonstrate that
it is mainly the manner of handling material that
counts.
The script-structure itself is a model for the manipu
lation of dramatic techniques. It is lagless. But what
of course is more immediately arresting is the nine
Stanford players. Viz.
One is first constrained to inquire: Where did they
scare up Coburn? For in his unpredicted tack from
the stock market to the stage, he has summarily cut
a squash.
And as if flying slices and seeds were not enough
to insure the bagging of a successful first night, there
proceed to be four old ladies, who though they do not
quite look their written ages, which run up to a
maximum of 72. nevertheless adhere faithfully to
their distinguishing idiosyncracies and exact from the
possibilities of their lines approximately 100 per cent
retribution.
These four, who. it had better be stated un
equivocally (since women are otherwise quick to
misinterpret) are passing exceptional actresses to be
discovered accrued in one play simultaneously. They
are -found to be as follows: Mary Louise Kennev.
Roberta Suiter. Jane Saulsbery, and Murray Stirton.
of whom the latter is insidiously given in unguarded
moments to rolling you gently into the aisle like a
snowball.
Martin Nalder is unselfconscious and consistent,
Lester Tucker practically eloquent. Newton Arnold
entirely conformed to the proper mood, and Patricia
Neilson. though playing a transparent satire, will still
take you in.
And if I may be so crude as to drum up business,
why don t you go over and get good and entertained
one evening soonabout?
