# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To The Editor:
Good many a person has deemed
it necessary to fidget at the point
of view of columnist C. Davis Covey
on Latins. He speaks about back
wardness, jingoes, emotional display.
Because of this, some people on
campus call him names: tactless,
anti-Stanford administration, hor
rid.
More than entitled to his own
opinions, I think his duty is to ex
press them. Take for instance the
subject matter on the July 27 Latin
American Fiesta which he took up
in his Daily column of last Fri
day. He proscribes the Fiesta as
liable to be a Hop.
The fact is, he may be outwardly
right. Let us examine the facts.
The $800 Mexican glassware ordered
for the Fiesta—as skillfully men
tioned by Covey in a genuine scoop
—will not arrive in time. Yester
day at 6:23 p. m., only 153 posters
and decorations had been completed,
while 320 were scheduled for that
time. The 30 rehearsals of the 10-
couple rumba dancers have been
curtailed to 22. Same token for the
ranehera, tango, and Samba re
hearsals.
The admission tickets have not
even been printed yet; although
that is not so important because
admission will be free. The Mexican
singers, the same that serenaded
Lagunita, who are going also to
sing for the Fiesta, are still looking
for a fourth guitar. The 15 pinatas
are not done. The Stirring Com
mittee has been cut down to 55
people from the original 80. The

Women's Gym floor has not yet been
leveled, for the onlookers to dance
on.
Yes, Covey may have hit it right
on the nose. It's liable to be a tre
mendous, sonorous, noisy, ruinous
flop.
