While EE-G's and ME-6's were
each carving out another victory
in order to hold on to first place in
their respective leagues, Wednes
day night's Softball activity saw
the oft-beaten ME-4's of Co. "A"
and E-l, T3 (l&2a) of Co ."C"
finally edging themselves into the
win column.
After four consecutive losses, the
ME-4's succeeded in eking out an
extra inning 12-11 decision over the
off-and-on CE-4's. Meanwhile on the
opposite of the sunken diamond, the
E-l T3 (l&2a) was outslugg'ing his
heretofore cellar partner by a 19-13
count.
The title bound EE-G's had a close
call in their quest for a fifth con
secutive win but did end up on the
long end of a 6-5 score. ME-6's,
present possessors of the Lop rung
in the Co. "C" league, easily de
cisioned third place E-l. T3 (2b&4),
6-2.
Over in the newly formed ERC
league, 2b & sb, and 3b & 4c re
mained in the select "no games
lost" department by hammering out
decisive victories over their oppon
ents. The la & lb's were handed
their initial defeat by the leading
2b & 5b aggregation—score, 10-6.
Reversing their last week's form,
the 2c & 5a ten took a closely
fought 6-4 tilt from 3a & 3b. In this
l'ray, Pitcher Porte whiffed eight
rival batsmen. The remaining three
teams each established themselves
more solidly in a fight for the cellar
positions.
In other ASTP intramural activi
ty, a few first-round games have
been played off in the company ten

nis and Ping-pong tournaments. In
the Co. "A" Ping-pong eliminations,
tourney favorite Zangwill Root out
played Blond while Whalen defeated
Schlesinger. Klein over Cutting,
Martin over Webb, and Kamiske
over Messenger shape up as the
present first round results of Co.
"C" playoffs. Only one tennis match
has been played: James took Wilmer,
G-2, 6-1, in a Co. "A" pairing.
A few minor changes have been
made in the intramural setup. The
ASTAP interleague finals will be
Aug. 22 instead of Aug. 15. The
ASTRP-ASTAP playoff has also
been set for one week-later.
In the swimming division, 88 aqua
specialists are signed up for the
eliminations which begin a week
from Saturday. The rule regarding
the number of events in which an
individual can participate has been
altered to permit only one race, one
relay, and one diving or underwater
distance swim per contestant.

Schlesinger. Klein over Cutting,
Martin over Webb, and Kamiske
over Messenger shape up as the
present first round results of Co.
"C" playoffs. Only one tennis match
has been played: James took Wilmer,
G-2, 6-1, in a Co. "A" pairing.
A few minor changes have been
made in the intramural setup. The
ASTAP interleague finals will be
Aug. 22 instead of Aug. 15. The
ASTRP-ASTAP playoff has also
been set for one week-later.
In the swimming division, 88 aqua

the number of events in which an
individual can participate has been
altered to permit only one race, one
relay, and one diving or underwater
