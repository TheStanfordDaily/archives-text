The sun beats on the face of the
earth, the elements thrash each other
for pure existence, the world of life,
love and death spins madly in space,
fog' pours into San Francisco, but
the ASTP program rolls merrily
along undaunted.
Indian campus GI Joes know it's
no rumor that the Friday night
dance sessions in the men's gym
have become "cut in." From re
liable sources, it's true that a maxi
mum number of Stanford lassies
will turn out for the trot tonight
after news travelled of last week's
outstanding dance band perform
ance. Roble hall voluntarily will be
present in force.
After more than two weeks as
soldiers, the eleven score ASTRPs
are learning the ropes of military
life under the able direction of
SCU 3905's officers and the helpful
assistance of the "basic" boys of
alvanced engineering. In this course
of climbing the soldier-student so
cial ladder, however, the ASTwerps
need no assistance; they seem to be
doing well on their own.
It is predicted that the civilian -
GI barbecue tomorrow night will
be more su9cessful than is an
ticipated. There will be no need to
sing for one's supper, as food, song,
and dance will be plentiful at the
all-campus event.
With the knowledge that some
day they'll be overseas, the AST
students are not worried about con
versing with foreigners. The pro
nunciation of the first universal
phrase is simple enough—"Have a
coke."
Thirty for Friday.
