they can on sea? Is the army's
"attack and maneuver" strategy in
vincible? Do bell-bottom trousers
gather more lipstick than khaki?
What's the answer . . . ?
In the fall the navy moves in in
force. To compensate, an equal
number of girls must anchor else
where. This means a near male
majority. Not content in challenging
Army supremacy, the Navy scuttles
a good portion of the best part of

the thing. Gobs are noted for a
smooth line. O. K., so the women

Stanford and any competition will

lodgement.
