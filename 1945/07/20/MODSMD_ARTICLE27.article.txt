### ART LEVINSON 
The stage is set for a battle "royal
deluxe" bet ween college football and
professional football. Pat West and
Roger Harding, two Pacific Coast
Conference boys, have decided to
cast their lot with the Cleveland
Rams in the National League. Both
are war veterans whose classes have
graduated, but are still eligible for
further collegiate competition be
cause of time spent in the army.
This situation will multiply as
more men return from the armed
services. A tidy sum — around
$4500 perannum—is much more of
an incentive to some than the hon
or and glory that goes with per
forming for dear ole' Eyewash U.
That this problem will hit Stan
ford is more than idle conjecture.
What can the colleges do?
Clear-Up Rules
A clarification of the rules with
the "play for pay" boys would cer
tainly help. The National League is
taking advantage of a technicality
under the existing rules, which
states that no player is to ink a
pro contract until his class has re
ceived their sheepskins. But what
about all the players who went
Uncle Sam's way, and whose classes
have graduated while they were out
of school. That precisely is the
touchy problem that now exists.
The newly formed American
League, however, has agreed not
to sign any player till the player
has personally received a college
diploma. They undoubtedly made
this rules to he in the good graces
of the colleges, but how the schools
can reciprocate this "good-heart
edness" is hard to sec. No school
is to prejudice any player for any
particular team or league.
Even if they did attempt to in
fluence players as to which team to
sign with, the player's decision would
be based entirely on who will pay
him the most.
Another reason for the American
circuit's not signing any undergrads
is that they don't plan on operating
till the war is over, a time when a
manpower shortage will not exist.

The National League, on the other
hand, is pressed to present tactics
because of the shortage of pigskin
toters.
A meeting between the officials
of the professional leagues and
the colleges is needed. They should
reach some satisfacory conclus
ion.
Londos Still Champ
One of the more ancients still
participating in sports is Jimmy
Londos, the Greek wrestler who—
along with many other grunt'n
groaners—claims the heavyweight
crown. Long before the game be
came stained with fakes and fixes,
"Jeemy" was going strong.
We had the occasion to see Lon
dos rassle some gent by the name
of Mike "Hep Hep" Nazarian, who
has the misfortune of not having
any teeth or hair, several months
ago. Besides pulling each other's
ears; dragging each other across the
ring by the nose; gouging eyes;
twisting arms and legs; and spitting
on each other, not too much hap
pened. Londos won the deciding
fall by kicking ''Hep Hep" in the
stomach, then using the ropes as a
catapult, threw himself against his
opponent, who rolled out of the ring
and was knocked out when his head
hit one of the seats.
