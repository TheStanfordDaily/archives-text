Open Letter to Drew Pearson

Dear Mr. Pearson:
No, we won't take much of your time. We
just have a story to tell—so we'll make it short.
Back in '41 "Moe" was at U.C.L.A.: a member
Df the student council, the Blue Key organiza
tion, Scabbard and Blade, and the Men's Serv
ice Club.
After being graduated with honors from the
university, where he was also a member of the
R.O.T.C. for four years, "Moe" received his
commission in the Army and joined the 442 nd.
You remember the 442 nd infantry regiment—
it was instrumental, they said, "in bringing to
a halt the bloody operations in Italy by the un
conditional surrender of all German troops."
But we're getting ahead of our story. During
:he campaign in France, Lieut. "Moe" taught
French officers the U.S. Army Manual, since he
was proficient in French. He acted as liaison
officer.
Then in Italy, just as his famed combat team
closed in for the knockout blow on the Nazi
enemy—Lieut. "Moe," former head cheerleader*
at U.C.L.A., was killed in action.
You ask what this story has to do with you.
Well, "Moe"—or Hitoshi Yonemura —was a
fapanese American.
Is this what you would call "Betrayal from
the East"?
