It's funny what one year of college will do to most
people. Take any group of eager, naive high school
graduates, season them with one year of college life,
and the results will be almost unbelievable. Some of
the finished products will border on the tragic, others
vill be just amusing.
A girl may be chosen as "Most Likely to Succeed"
oy her high school graduating class but oftentimes
gets tangled up in her world of paper-machee dreams.
Then she has three choices: quit school, become em
bittered, or try and straighten out her problem.
Most of them take the second course and wear an
atmosphere of "hardened intellectualism." You've seen
them running around, trying to discover a universal
panacea for the world's cares and at the same time be
coming more confused themselves. Just the other day
a breathless history major asked me what I thought of
St. Thomas Aquinas. I replied that I didn't know there
was a horse by that name and what race was it running
in. Which shows why I'm not in the service.
Equally interesting are the males about the campus,
especially the 17 year olds who try to cram four years
af college into 8 hectic months. You see them all the
time, drinking beer and giving some girl the old Civ
Libe rush. The fabulous 17 year olds, with their "Hol
lywood" sport coats and "know-it-all" look. Taking
che world by the teeth and then having to spit it out
at their eighteenth birthday.

In a day or two one of the last of the pre-war boys
â–ºvill leave Stanford for Hawaii and points west. We're
speaking of "Sexy" Rex Alsup, who has been playing
nop-scotch with his draft board for three years now.
Everybody around these pat'ts will be sorry to see Rex
go, but before he gets off we're throwing a little "Good

bye Rosotti Park, Hello Honolulu" party for him
Same time, same place.
