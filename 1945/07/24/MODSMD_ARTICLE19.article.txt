# AST ECHOES

### MEEMI 
At last they were alone; far from the hubuh of the
busy noisy streets of Palo Alto, the two ol them had
come to spend their last few hours together. Jean was
young and beautiful, a lieutenant in the Army Nurse
Corps; Dave was tall and handsome, a buck private in
the ASTP. How they ever happened to meet no one can
tell, but it must have been fate. Yes fate had brought
them together and now it was about to take them
apart. Dave accepted things as they were because he
was realistic about all such matters; four months in
Basic Training had taught him this. But Jean behaved
like all women do and the tears could not be held back.
"Why must this happen to us?" she sobbed.
"Darling, don't cry. Someday we will be together
again, someday soon. I'll love you just as much with
the ocean between us as I have while rank stood be
tween us. So you do your duty and go overseas, Jean,
while I stay back and fight the battle of Stanford
University.
So Dave Rubin has returned once more "to those
dear old Bayshore Bars we know so well," and we are
inclined to agree with him that rank doesn't mean too
much anymore. Of course the Major can still dance
with the Lieutenant's wife, and the Lieutenant can
still cut in on a poor ERC, but in the end Democracy
must prevail. So you girls who have not as yet seen
what we mean, come on over to the Pavilion at the
next Army Dance and listen to "Not so Square" Fleher,
and his crew of refugees from the Teen Agers.
Things have gotten pretty chicken around Encina
lately, in fact the Miller-Moseman bus line to the
Shore, Rosotti's and points west was forced to call off
its scheduled run to Papa's place the other night. They
got started all right, but as they were passing Engin
eering Corner, Eagle Eye Seibel spotted a slinky grey
car in hot pursuit. "Yipe, it's The Captain," the rear ob
server radioed from his post atop the spare tire. But
the pilot was undaunted; without wasting a moment's
time he swerved to avoid hitting the inevitable Meemi,
Herman, Meemi, et al, and rounded the corner of the
post office. Not once, but six times did the Rosotti
Limited lead the captain around those hallowed portals.
But it was all to no avail, the pursuer stuck with them
like flies do to Encina Chow. Finally, in sheer desper
ation and dying of thirst, they headed back to the
mansion. They quenched their thirst with some straight
Palo Alto water and at 10:29 they were safely tucked
away in their soft GI beds. "Shucks," said the Cap
tain, "I'll have to use up those demerit slips on Fein
berg again" . . .

the pilot was undaunted; without wasting a moment's
time he swerved to avoid hitting the inevitable Meemi,
Herman, Meemi, et al, and rounded the corner of the
post office. Not once, but six times did the Rosotti
Limited lead the captain around those hallowed portals.
But it was all to no avail, the pursuer stuck with them
like flies do to Encina Chow. Finally, in sheer desper
ation and dying of thirst, they headed back to the
mansion. They quenched their thirst with some straight
Palo Alto water and at 10:29 they were safely tucked
away in their soft GI beds. "Shucks," said the Cap
tain, "I'll have to use up those demerit slips on Fein
berg again" . . .
At last they were alone; far from the hubuh of the
busy noisy streets of Palo Alto, the two ol them had
come to spend their last few hours together. Jean was
young and beautiful, a lieutenant in the Army Nurse
Corps; Dave was tall and handsome, a buck private in
the ASTP. How they ever happened to meet no one can
tell, but it must have been fate. Yes fate had brought
them together and now it was about to take them
apart. Dave accepted things as they were because he
was realistic about all such matters; four months in
Basic Training had taught him this. But Jean behaved
like all women do and the tears could not be held back.
"Why must this happen to us?" she sobbed.
"Darling, don't cry. Someday we will be together
again, someday soon. I'll love you just as much with
the ocean between us as I have while rank stood be
tween us. So you do your duty and go overseas, Jean,
while I stay back and fight the battle of Stanford
University.
So Dave Rubin has returned once more "to those
dear old Bayshore Bars we know so well," and we are
inclined to agree with him that rank doesn't mean too
much anymore. Of course the Major can still dance
with the Lieutenant's wife, and the Lieutenant can
still cut in on a poor ERC, but in the end Democracy
must prevail. So you girls who have not as yet seen
what we mean, come on over to the Pavilion at the
next Army Dance and listen to "Not so Square" Fleher,
and his crew of refugees from the Teen Agers.
Things have gotten pretty chicken around Encina
lately, in fact the Miller-Moseman bus line to the
Shore, Rosotti's and points west was forced to call off
its scheduled run to Papa's place the other night. They
got started all right, but as they were passing Engin
eering Corner, Eagle Eye Seibel spotted a slinky grey
car in hot pursuit. "Yipe, it's The Captain," the rear ob
server radioed from his post atop the spare tire. But
the pilot was undaunted; without wasting a moment's
time he swerved to avoid hitting the inevitable Meemi,
Herman, Meemi, et al, and rounded the corner of the
