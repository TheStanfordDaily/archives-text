### CYCLONE COVEY 
CARIBBEAN MYSTERY, now playing at the Stan
ford, points up the paradox that a B-picture which is
freed of A-picture conventions, turns out sometimes

to be a better picture than most
A-pictures. The concentration of
the industry's money and manpower
upon the so-called A-classification
carries concomitant stylizing, while
the B-classification, which is paid
little attention and less appropria
tion, is left alone to make movies
if it can, and not pretentious show
pieces.
Caribbean Mystery is not a war
picture, a musical revue, a love
story, a stage play, or a slapstick

comedy.
The hero is not at all glamorous, and the potential
heroine, who might have proved thoroughly clinchable,
is killed off quick.
distinct individuals, more or less.
The story does not come to a complete halt every
five minutes while you look at some set number, but
is continuous, as if it were a motion picture instead of
a succession of tableau.
And it does not pretend to be any more than an in
teresting and amusing 90 minutes or thereabouts.
Under which circumstances, who is going to mind the
husking of a cob of corn or two?

NOB HILL, also playing, treats Steve Brodie fans
to a reappearance of George Raft, and the public at
large to a well-stuffed museum of the worst of early

San Francisco, in technicolor.
All that money, all that yardage
of film, all those writers, technic
ians. players; all that trouble, all
that money, all that technicolor, all
that scenery decoration, all that
money.
Why. with all that they could
have produced one of the great
artistic monuments of civilization
something different, noble, worth
while. They could even have had
good singing.

TO MY MANY, MANY FANS who have written in
to ask. the Latin American Fiesta will take place on
July 27 of this year
