It seems that the Stanford Ax has
chopped quite a hole in the Cali
fornia football squad. Either directly
or indirectly Cal has lost one man
for the whole season and another
for three and three-fourths games
due to the stealing of the Ax.
Roger Harding last week signed up
with a professional club. This move
by Harding was undoubtedly due
partly to the fact that he was banned
from the first four games of Cal's !
schedule. Roger Harding was the ;
man around whom Buck Shaw was
planning to build the forward wall, j
Now Shaw has lost Ted Kenfield.
Kenfield is a transfer from the Uni
versity of Nebraska where he was
among the top players in the Bix
Six Conference. Ted played quarter
for the Corn Huskers, and from all
reports was slated to play the same
position for Cal.
The loss of these two puts the
Bears pretty far behind the eight
ball. To begin with the football
squad was short of experienced play
ers, and at the present rale of sub
traction from the meager turnout of
experienced men Cal will open the
season with a group of inexpe
rienced footballers.
Sports Writer Appeals
A certain San Francisco sports
writer, namely Will Connolly of the
Chronicle, has appealed, through his
column, to the proper authorities in
an attempt to have Kengeld's penalty
annulled.
He bases his plea on two things.
First, that Kenfield is a transfer from
Nebraska and therefore the Stanford
Ax has no meaning to him. He went
along with the boys, on a silly raid
on "the Mausoleum of the Ax," just
to be with them.
Secondly, Mr. Connolly stated, in
no uncertain terms, that the Ax pact
should be broken because Stanford
isn't playing anymore. He stated
that the penalty should be forgotten
until Cal and Stanford resume their
football rivalry.
Answer io Mr. Connolly
Mr. Kenfield, at the time he made
his excursion to the farm, undoubt
edly did know about the Ax pact.
Before going to Nebraska Kenfield

went to Stanford. He left here when
it was decided Stanford would
temporarily drop football. So it
seems that Kenfield is more guilty
than others who partifipated in the
Ax stealing, and deserves the pun
ishment given him. Mr. Connolly
should get some facts before he
starts writing.
The remark that it is in a
mausoleum isn't one bit appreciated
at Stanford. The Ax, which Stanford
won in fair competition and which
is part of our tradition, was on dis
play in the Stanford Union building
up to the time of the stealing, and
will be returned there shortly. T1
Union is a central gathering plai—
for all students. If Mr. Connolly still
insists on calling the Ax's show place
a mausoleum I invite him down so
that ignorance will not prevail.
Connolly Out Of Bounds
In reply to Connolly's advice that
the Ax pact should be scrapped I
would like to say that he is stepping
i out of bounds. The agreement is
strictly an inter-schol affair. It has
ended a lot of quarreling and fight—
j ing which caused both personal and
1 property damage. If the pact is
[ scrapped by Cal it wouldn't be ex
j actly sportsmanship, which is one
| of the things that football is supposed
| to foster.
Stanford has not had a team be
j cause of the lack of manpower. We
i have had an army program here
whereas Cal has a navy and marine
program. The navy and marine
trainees are allowed to play football.
The army trainees are not. Next
year we will haVe navy trainees, and
we will play fotball.
All said and done, I think it is too
bad that Cal had to lose men on ac
count of the Ax stealing episode.
But the men deserved the punish
j ment for violation of the pact, and
jit is too bad that the pact, which has
| done wonders for Stanford-Cal re
i lationships, should be criticized by
people who should know better.

It seems that the Stanford Ax has
chopped quite a hole in the Cali
fornia football squad. Either directly
or indirectly Cal has lost one man
for the whole season and another
for three and three-fourths games
due to the stealing of the Ax.
Roger Harding last week signed up
with a professional club. This move
by Harding was undoubtedly due
partly to the fact that he was banned
from the first four games of Cal's !
schedule. Roger Harding was the ;
man around whom Buck Shaw was
planning to build the forward wall, j
Now Shaw has lost Ted Kenfield.
Kenfield is a transfer from the Uni
versity of Nebraska where he was
among the top players in the Bix
Six Conference. Ted played quarter
for the Corn Huskers, and from all
reports was slated to play the same
position for Cal.
The loss of these two puts the
Bears pretty far behind the eight
ball. To begin with the football
squad was short of experienced play
ers, and at the present rale of sub
traction from the meager turnout of
experienced men Cal will open the
season with a group of inexpe
rienced footballers.
Sports Writer Appeals
A certain San Francisco sports
writer, namely Will Connolly of the
Chronicle, has appealed, through his
column, to the proper authorities in
an attempt to have Kengeld's penalty
annulled.
He bases his plea on two things.
First, that Kenfield is a transfer from
Nebraska and therefore the Stanford
Ax has no meaning to him. He went
along with the boys, on a silly raid
on "the Mausoleum of the Ax," just
to be with them.
Secondly, Mr. Connolly stated, in
no uncertain terms, that the Ax pact
should be broken because Stanford
isn't playing anymore. He stated
that the penalty should be forgotten
until Cal and Stanford resume their
football rivalry.
Answer io Mr. Connolly
Mr. Kenfield, at the time he made
his excursion to the farm, undoubt
edly did know about the Ax pact.
Before going to Nebraska Kenfield

went to Stanford. He left here when
it was decided Stanford would
temporarily drop football. So it
seems that Kenfield is more guilty
than others who partifipated in the
Ax stealing, and deserves the pun
ishment given him. Mr. Connolly
should get some facts before he
starts writing.
The remark that it is in a
mausoleum isn't one bit appreciated
at Stanford. The Ax, which Stanford
won in fair competition and which
is part of our tradition, was on dis
play in the Stanford Union building
up to the time of the stealing, and
will be returned there shortly. T1
Union is a central gathering plai—
for all students. If Mr. Connolly still
insists on calling the Ax's show place
a mausoleum I invite him down so
that ignorance will not prevail.
Connolly Out Of Bounds
In reply to Connolly's advice that
the Ax pact should be scrapped I
would like to say that he is stepping
i out of bounds. The agreement is
strictly an inter-schol affair. It has
ended a lot of quarreling and fight—
j ing which caused both personal and
1 property damage. If the pact is
[ scrapped by Cal it wouldn't be ex
j actly sportsmanship, which is one
| of the things that football is supposed
| to foster.
Stanford has not had a team be
j cause of the lack of manpower. We
i have had an army program here
whereas Cal has a navy and marine
program. The navy and marine
trainees are allowed to play football.
The army trainees are not. Next
year we will haVe navy trainees, and
we will play fotball.
All said and done, I think it is too
bad that Cal had to lose men on ac
count of the Ax stealing episode.
But the men deserved the punish
j ment for violation of the pact, and
jit is too bad that the pact, which has
| done wonders for Stanford-Cal re
