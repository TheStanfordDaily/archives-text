# Dr. Thomas Bailey Accounts for American Failure To Join World League In New Book
## 
### SYDNEY ROSS 
YVouthow Wilson and the Great
Betrayal. By Thomas A. Bailey. The
Macmillan Company, 1945.

Most Stanford
students of today
were still unborn
when the events
described in this
volume took
place. Those
events, neverthe
less, have had

profound significance in the political
affairs of the present time, affecting
the whole direction of international
relations in the crucial years be
tween the two World Wax's.
Authoritative Account
Professor Bailey, from this point
of view, has produced a satisfying
and authoritative account of the fail
ure of the United States to ratify
the Treaty of Versailles and join
the League of Nations. His account
is based on painstaking collections
of data and impartial interpretation
solely by the light of the historical
facts. To this he has added his per
sonal gift of historical narration—
and so weaves together the many
strands of his account that the book
is as easy to read and a great deal
more fascinating than many a novel.
Where so much is excellent and
where the reader has so much
reason to be sincerely grateful to
the author, the pointing out of a
few faults becomes merely the

churlish pastime of the professional
book reviewer. Here we shall note
only one. whose relative insignifi
cance is a measure of the few others
and is in itself a tribute to the ex
cellence of the work in general.
Professor Bailey is too good a
scholar to permit himself the loose
ness of expression in phrases such
as "Anglo-Saxon love of compro
mise" and "Scotch-Irish temper and
obstinacy.". These notions do very
well for the lady novelists who
appeal to the common prejudices of
their readers: they are now too much
in disrepute with the more thought
ful readers for whom this book is
intended.

A benefit that this book confers
in its efforts to destroy the historic
ally false notion of an idealistic
Wilson betrayed by a sinister Senator
Lodge. For the purposes of Holly
wood it is good drama to oppose the
hero and the villain, but the story
of Wilson is that truer tragedy of
a man and his noble purposes be
trayed by weaknesses inherent in
himself (the quality of Shakespear
ian tragedy).
It is no far-fetched analogy to see
repeated the tragic histories of
Hamlet, of Othello and of Macbeth
in this twentieth-century story of
Woodrow Wilson and the great be
trayal.

is as easy to read and a great deal
more fascinating than many a novel.
Where so much is excellent and
where the reader has so much
reason to be sincerely grateful to
the author, the pointing out of a
few faults becomes merely the

churlish pastime of the professional
book reviewer. Here we shall note
only one. whose relative insignifi
cance is a measure of the few others
and is in itself a tribute to the ex
cellence of the work in general.
Professor Bailey is too good a
scholar to permit himself the loose
ness of expression in phrases such
as "Anglo-Saxon love of compro
mise" and "Scotch-Irish temper and
obstinacy.". These notions do very
well for the lady novelists who
appeal to the common prejudices of
their readers: they are now too much
in disrepute with the more thought
ful readers for whom this book is
intended.

A benefit that this book confers
in its efforts to destroy the historic
ally false notion of an idealistic
Wilson betrayed by a sinister Senator
Lodge. For the purposes of Holly
wood it is good drama to oppose the
hero and the villain, but the story
of Wilson is that truer tragedy of
a man and his noble purposes be
trayed by weaknesses inherent in
himself (the quality of Shakespear
ian tragedy).
It is no far-fetched analogy to see
repeated the tragic histories of
Hamlet, of Othello and of Macbeth
in this twentieth-century story of
Woodrow Wilson and the great be
trayal.

YVouthow Wilson and the Great
Betrayal. By Thomas A. Bailey. The
Macmillan Company, 1945.

Most Stanford
students of today
were still unborn
when the events
described in this
volume took
place. Those
events, neverthe
less, have had

profound significance in the political
affairs of the present time, affecting
the whole direction of international
relations in the crucial years be
tween the two World Wax's.
Authoritative Account
Professor Bailey, from this point
of view, has produced a satisfying
and authoritative account of the fail
ure of the United States to ratify
the Treaty of Versailles and join
the League of Nations. His account
is based on painstaking collections
of data and impartial interpretation
solely by the light of the historical
facts. To this he has added his per
sonal gift of historical narration—
and so weaves together the many
strands of his account that the book
is as easy to read and a great deal
more fascinating than many a novel.
