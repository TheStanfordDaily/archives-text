# Radio Institute in Third Consecutive Year
## 
### BILL FILERS 
Again this summer, 77 micro
phone-minded young men and wo
men are attending the Stanford-
KPO Radio Institute. In its third
consecutive year, the eight-week
concise course is devoted to intensive
professional instruction in various
phases of the broadcasting industry.
Students attend studio-classes
Monday, Wednesday and Friday in
the modern NBC Radio City at
Taylor and O'Farrell in San Fran
cisco. On Tuesday and Thursday,
they meet in the Speech and Drama
workshop in the Memorial Audito
rium. They average well over 20
class and studio hours each week.
Instruction and Experience
Outstanding NBC announcers, pro
ducers, and engineers combine their
talents with campus Speech and
Drama professors to give students
both expert instruction and practical
experience. Instructors from NBC
are John W. Elwood, general man

ager of KPO-NBC San Francisco;
Floyd Farr, chief announcer and as
sistant to the program director; John
Grover, staff announcer-producer;
Don Hall, radio engineer; and
Dwight Newton, radio news editor.
Stanford teachers include Harlen
M. Adams, assistant professor of the
Department of Speech and Drama;
Mr. Lawrence Carra of Texas Uni
versity, and E. Clayton McCarty of
Trinity University. Mr. McCarty is
well-known as a playwright, and is
an instructor in the writing course.
Other Institutes
Two other radio institutes are held
each summer in the United States:
one at Northwestern University in
Evanston, Illinois; the other at the
University of California at Los
Angeles.
Of the 77 enrolled, 17 are teachers,
learning to use radio as a resource
for classroom instruction. Many plan
to form their own radio workshops
next fall.
Climax of the course—really the
graduation exercises—is a 30-minute
Pacific Network broadcast written,
produced and acted by star members
of the Institute. Writers, of which
there are more than 30, compete to
produce the prize-winning script.
This year the program will be aired
on Saturday, August 19.

Scholarship
Last year, Miss Jewel Drickamer,
a Cleveland librarian, wrote the
prize-winning play titled "Time
Chair." It was a fantasy—using the
chair as a device to travel into the
past and future.
Winner of the Institute's scholar
ship in 1944 was Mary Louise Brock
man of San Francisco. The out
standing student in the course is
awarded a tuition refund.
New convenience this year is a
well-stocked library of broadcast
ing information. In the Memorial
Auditorium lobby, the collection in
cludes printed editions of radio
scripts by Norman Corwin, Arch
Obbler, and Max Wiley, texts on
writing, production, and engineering,
and records of the history of broad
casting.
Graduates, Too
Opportunities for graduates? There
certainly are! A Seattle student,
even before completion of the course
last year, stepped into a Blue Net
work announcing position. Another,
Norman Cramer, became a staff
writer for KSFO. Several joined the
staff of KLE, Portland. Others are
employed in numerous California
stations.
Top broadcasters bring their view
points to the classes in guest lec
tures. Arnold Marquis, Hollywood
writer-producer of the documentary
Pacific Story and formerly producer
of such shows as Unlimited Horizons
and Dupont's Cavalcade of America,
spoke to the aspiring radio writers.
Advice
Mrs. Kay Lardie, Radio Director
of the Detroit Public Schols, an
swered questions of the writers and
teachers. Her advice to the writers:
"stay glued to your chair until you
finish a script."
Mrs. Inez G. Richardson, Hoover
Library curator and Co-Director of
the Institute, lectures in the course
on Broadcasting the the United
States. Sydney Strokes, Vice Presi
