# Tickets on Sale Next Week For Lagunita, Roble Formal
## 
### 
"It—is—later—than—you—think!"
Yes, time does fly. and now is the
time to start thinking about getting
that date for Hua Hao Yueh Yuan,
the Lagunita-Roble summer formal.
It's only one week and one day
away, so ask that super dream man
(or reasonable facsimile) now and
avoid the rush. The tickets will be
on sale next week in Roble and
Lagunita two days before they are
offered to the Campus at the ASSU
office at $2.00 a bid. Jo Yglesias.
Lagunita, and Joan Welch. Roble,
are in charge of the tickets and
programs.
The programs, designed in the
Chinese theme by Lee Hui-choung,
picture the silhouette of a romantic
couple under a pagoda.
Hua Hao Yueh Yuan, in case you
were wondering, is pronounced as
who-ah how you-eh you-on. It's in

the Mandarin dialect and there's
something complicated about the
first syllable being in the first tone
and the second in the third tone and
so on, but the most important thing
to remember is that it means a full
moon and flowers, both of which
will be much in evidence Saturday
night. August 4. from 9 to 1 a.m.
in the women's gym.
Nature is generously providing the
moon (free of charge) and the place
is going to be reeking with flowers
(not so free). Mammoth baskets
filled with flowers and greens will
hang from the ceiling of the gym.
and fresh asters and other blooms
will be found blooming on tables in
the court and other places where i
there's room. The tables will also 1
be decorated with miniature Chinese
bridges, just to remind everyone
again that the theme is Chinese.
