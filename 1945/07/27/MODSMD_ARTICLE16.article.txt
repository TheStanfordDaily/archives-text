persistent knock but we dismissed it with an
'Oh, don't bother. It's only Opportunity again;

LJniversity assembly at Stanford. We had a

ford Family—some temporary, some permanent
—how much group spirit and interest we could

ns could have taken the initiative ourselves in
singing rally and game songs. Our newly
elected cheer leader could have led the group
tn Stanford yells and cheers, which altogether
too many of us are forgetting. The A.S.S.U.
president or vice-president, as representative of
the student body, could have introduced Dr.
fresidder.
