The overwhelming triumph of labor leader
ship in the British election, the results of which
were announced yesterday, is more than just
the backward swing of the political pendulum
in a war-weary Great Britain. It cannot be
merely a tit-for-tat discard of the Conservative
party that waged the war.
For the first time in British history, the cen
:uries-old promise of a Socialist millennium
nas been entered into with the people's eyes
wide open. The platform of the British Labour
party has and always has advocated the so
cialization of the national bank, utilities and
land. Everyone in Britain knows it and appar
antly approves.
The fond theory that we have built up in
respect to Russia —that we Capitalist nations
would go our way and the Socialist would go
theirs—is lying right over in the corner in a
rocked hat. Socialism has come to Britain by
the most democratic of means—election. This
is the thing that even many Socialists, notably
Communist party Socialists, never believed
would happen. Clement Atlee is not a crack
pot; probably he is even less impetuous than
Winston Churchill. He is not the cartoonist's
idea of a Socialist toting a bomb. He will give
the party sane leadership. All the world, his
tory, and the Socialist-fringed thinking of many
Americans will be observing the efforts of the
new British government to bring to the Empire
a "new way of life." Wisdom and courage may
allow the Labour party to make a great contri
bution to British life, which has lately been at
tacked more and more—from both within and
without the Empire. Or a closer look at the
Socialist program may give the world-wide
movement a permanent black eye.

lie opinion is informed and accepts Socialism
for Great Britain, there will have to be a re
suscitated capitalism to meet the challenge of
the new "His Majesty's government." The last
century's greatest stronghold of imperialistic
philosophy and entrenched toryism has in a
bold gesture become this decade's most star
tling anachronism.—B. G.
