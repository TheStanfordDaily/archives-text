### DICK BOWER 
A MEDAL FOR BENNY—now playing at the Stan
ford Theatre.
''A Medal for Benny," Dorothy Lamour's first "dra
matic" role, was written by John Steinbeck, who ap
pai'ently is grinding out Hollywood scripts just for the
money involved. His latest attempt certainly lacks the
charm and good-fellowship of "Tortilla Flat," and is
glutted throughout with Hollywood cliches.
The plot deals with a group of California "paisanos,"
and their reaction to unexpected fame and fortune.
Dorothy Lamour's boy friend, Benny, who was evi
dently a raucous, bawdy individual, is in the service,
and Arturo de Cordova, an equally disreputable char
acter, is trying to "move in."
Dottie repulses both the swarthy de Cordova and
the audience as she tries to master her impetuous lover
and a Spanish dialect. This sort of activity goes on
for two or three reels until word is received that
Benny has been killed. Here the picture's gait im
proves and J. Carroll Naish. as Benny's father, turns in
a fine bit of acting.
The picture concludes in a patriotic burst of glory
as Naish foils the attempt of the local chamber of
commerce to turn Benny's death into a publicity stunt.
Of course Lamour and de Cordova end up in each
other's arms at the final fade-out as peace and con
tentment again reign in Magic Movieland.
"A Medal for Benny" remains as a pretty drab affair,
but is redeemed to some extent by J. Carroll Naish's
moving portrayal of a man trapped in the vicious
clutches of today's high-pressured living. This will un
doubtedly be Dorothy Lamour's first and last attempt
at serious acting and her next picture will find Dottie
stranded, no doubt, on some island west of Wilshire
Boulevard.
The second picture on the Stanford bill is a rehash
by Warner's of "The Petrified Forest." The film is
called "Escape in the Desert"and tells the tale of
some escaped German prisoners who terrorize the
Arizona countryside. Philip Dorn, Helmut Dantine,
and Alan Hale head a heterogeneous cast that just
can't make the whole thing sound convincing. But
who's going to argue about a thing like that when the
picture will undoubtedly make the Warners a million
dollars or so.
And now a plug for a forthcoming film—"The Pic
ture of Dorian Gray," which is just about the best
show we've seen this year, even though Wolcott Gibbs,
New Yorker reviewer, doesn't share the same opinion.
M-G-M has transformed Oscar Wilde's story into a
compact, smoothly-acted picture that is well worth
your attention.
As Louella Parsons would say, "that's all today."
