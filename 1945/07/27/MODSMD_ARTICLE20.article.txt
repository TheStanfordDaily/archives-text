The pounding of Japanese industrial centers posseses
a double significance. First of all, it is to ruin the
Japanese sources of supply, and, secondly, to draw the
enemy air forces into pitched battle now instead of
when they can damage our shipping during the in
vasion. Our strategy involves not f>nly using heavily
gunned superforts as bait, but more expensive naval
units. Yet, the Japanese seem to be declining the
gambit. The Germans tried to do the same thing at
first, but our bombing forced them to meet us with
interceptors that could have been used as fighter
bombers, and to trade them off at too high a rate for
profit.
The pounding of Japanese industrial centers possesses
craft ready for use, although none of the figures state
how much of this is front line and how much is re
serve. It is highly possible that, as some naval strate
gists have claimed, our bombing of fuel centers has
grounded all of it. Still, we did a heavy job against
Germany's more limited fuel centers, and the Luftwaffe
still managed to rise at the end.
The Japanese are probably reasoning that the only
way they will be able to stop the first phase of our
invasion is to employ their airpower in mass, which
might be right reasoning, since light bombers can al
ways dive at shipping through the strongest fighter
escort, avoiding a fight by speed. The damage done at
Okinawa proves this. Although ships are heavily
armed with anti-aircraft guns and can hold their own,
landing craft, which must he in motion continually
until propel fort iacilities are arranged, are much more
vulnerable.
Also, the emeny air force might have moved to
Manchuria if that is to be the scene of the last stand
of the Japanese Empire. Considering the tightness of
the naval blockade, that would have been about the
only thing that could reach there.
