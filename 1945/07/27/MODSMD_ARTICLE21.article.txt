To the Editor:
For the Latin American Fiesta of
today, C. Davis Covey was called in
cahoots for what it was thought was
non-standard, incognito-like type of
propaganda. Since some people on
Campus seem to have rather a thin
sense of humor, we now delve into
the grammar school level to explain
that all which Covey did was grac
iously to lend his cooperation
through his column for said propa
ganda.
Tonight at 8, free admission to the
women's gym will allow Covey's
detractors to find out if the Fiesta
is to be a flop. (We think it will be.)
To Co-op's Cyclone Covey, a grad
uate student in history, our hearty
(historical) vhanks.
