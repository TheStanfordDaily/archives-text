# REFLECTIONS SEEN ON A CEILING

### 
Listen to this," said the girl who
was flat on her back reading to the
girl who was enjoying a Cellar cig
arette, also flat on her back. " 'You
kneel on one knee, like a knight get
ting his sword . . . When you get
exhausted, you sit, but don't bend-
Honest, I know'."
A sort of sad giggle exploded in
the throat of the girl who was smok
ing. "Where," she asked, "are you
reading about us?"
"The New Yorker, July 7." The
first girl also made extraordinary,
sad sounds of amusement. "Only,
that's a description of picking straw
berries."
"Oh." And the second girl blew a
dreamy smoke ring. "I was sure it
was us."
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
"Still on the New Yorker?"
"Uuh-huh. I'm reading about Joe
E. Brown. Listen to this: 'Training
had enabled him to think practical
ly nothing of two fractures of the
spinal column'."
At this, a spectacular incoherence
seized them. The two girls (Stanford
girls, by the way) simply gave in to
hysterics.
"So that's why we're in the hos
pital!"
"We just weren't trained right!"
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
Only July 33th they celebrated
their anniversaries.
"One month ago tonight," mut
tered the first girl, "I didn't know
what hit me. And here I am."
"And two months ago," growled
the second girl, "I went on a hay
ride. And here we are."
"Oh. bird.'
"Oh, (word.)"
Who'd have thought, they both
mused, that they'd be graduating in
zipperless, no-stretch corsets, like a
couple of turtles? June 17th, cli

mactic clay. One of them in a hos
pital bed, visited by Dr. Tresidder
and Dr. Mitchell; the other gasping
in the hot sun, fearful that she oi
lier cast would melt and cause a
commotion.
But now that they were Stan
ford graduates, after all, they de
cided that they could educate them
selves. Besides, time sagged with
boredom. So the gill of The New
Yorker switched to The Moral Con
quest of Germany and often uttered
aloud things like, "Emil Ludwig says
that the Wellington symphony is
Beethoven's poorest."
And thus it was, time continued.
It came and went, etc. And so did
the hours.
"You know, I think maybe we're
unpopular. Or nobody knows we're
here. Or they've forgotten us, or . . "
"Might we run a want ad in the
Daily . . . ?"
"Or send out invitations? 'At
home, Palo Alto Hospital, 2:00 to
3:30 and 7:00 to 8:40'."
Obviously, more time passed, be
cause by now our reader of The
Magic Mountain had covered all TIG
pages of it and had begun an un
sentimental journey to Persons and
Places with George Santayana. "His
re-creation of the Harvard he knew,"
claimed the book jacket,' "is ex
quisitely nostalgic, but is without a
hint of sentimentality."
Deciding that such was not as im
possible as it appeared, they com
menced reviewing the Stanford of
1940, 41, and 42, with exquisite nos
talgia, and—perhaps—without senti
mentality. There was Daily Editor
Dwight Hutchinson, when Bruce Jes
sup was A.S.S.U. president, and on
Saturday afternoons the feminine
rooting section, row upon row of
heads of long, shining hair, waved
pom-poms for Frankie Albert and
the rest of the Indians. There was
that historic Back-to-the-Farm Day
in 1941 when a real, live horse gal
loped down the aisle of the Edu
cation Auditorium shooting a cap
pistol at the members of Mr. Farm
er's class in Contemporary Art.
There was Stanford's Fiftieth Anni
versary, with Dr. Wilbur and Herb
ert Hoover taking part in impressive
ceremonies, and with dancing after
wards on the Quad, lighted by a
powerful spotlight from the top of
the newly-dedicated Hoover Library.
And then there were the old
Dinah's and the old L'Omelette, both
destroyed by fires that burned up, as
well, a lot of old Stanford associ
ations and memories. And how many
people, our reminiscing girls wond
ered, know the origin of that me
morable line: "You can do it, Frank
ie, you can do it!" (Reprinted here
by courtesy of the Gaieties.) And
then there were those recurrent
blackouts, and that frantic Friday
night when practically all the wom
en in Union squashed themselves in
to an inside, windowless room to
study for the next morning's finals.
All this was hashed over between
them with exquisite nostalgia, and
you understand and of course, with
out a hint of sentimentaliay.
Time continued, etc. Santayana
continued too. Presently he was
again quoted aloud, as follows:
"There is a sort of indifference to
time, as there is a sort of silence,
which goes with veritable sympathy.
. . . Those who are jealous, jealous
of time, of rivals, of accidents"
(here our girls emitted odd noises)
"care for something vague that es
capes them not . . . They are haunted
souls, hunting for they know not
what."
"Sort of like us. huh?"
"Yes, Streb."
"Ginny," Streb said, "it's eight
thirty."
"I know," Ginny grumbled. "Could
it be we're haunted souls hunting
for visitors?"
"Anyway, it's nice the Nurses'
Aides come to visit us."
And they began to console them
selves by talking seriously about the
Nurses' Aides. Many of them were
from Stanford, girls they'd seen on
Quad and in the Cellar. They were
doing good work at the hospital, giv
ing their time where it was greatly
needed, visiting all their patients
with smiles and help and encourage
ment. The Nurses' Aides were to be
admired and commended.
Nevertheless, a couple of hours
later a terrible, despairing "OH.
BIRD!" resounded through the dark
ness in the room. Just which one
of the girls it was who made this
closing comment is hard to tell. Per
haps the reader, who may be slight
ly acquainted with them, can decide.
Their names were
Lorrain Streblow
and
Virginia Clagett
P. S. Streb is still there, in Room
225. And visitors are still welcome,
with or without chocolate cake.

menced reviewing the Stanford of
1940, 41, and 42, with exquisite nos
talgia, and—perhaps—without senti
mentality. There was Daily Editor
Dwight Hutchinson, when Bruce Jes
sup was A.S.S.U. president, and on
Saturday afternoons the feminine
rooting section, row upon row of
heads of long, shining hair, waved
pom-poms for Frankie Albert and
the rest of the Indians. There was
that historic Back-to-the-Farm Day
in 1941 when a real, live horse gal
loped down the aisle of the Edu
cation Auditorium shooting a cap
pistol at the members of Mr. Farm
er's class in Contemporary Art.
There was Stanford's Fiftieth Anni
versary, with Dr. Wilbur and Herb
ert Hoover taking part in impressive
ceremonies, and with dancing after
wards on the Quad, lighted by a
powerful spotlight from the top of
the newly-dedicated Hoover Library.
And then there were the old
Dinah's and the old L'Omelette, both
destroyed by fires that burned up, as
well, a lot of old Stanford associ
ations and memories. And how many
people, our reminiscing girls wond
ered, know the origin of that me
morable line: "You can do it, Frank
ie, you can do it!" (Reprinted here
by courtesy of the Gaieties.) And
then there were those recurrent
blackouts, and that frantic Friday
night when practically all the wom
en in Union squashed themselves in
to an inside, windowless room to
study for the next morning's finals.
All this was hashed over between
them with exquisite nostalgia, and
you understand and of course, with
out a hint of sentimentaliay.
Time continued, etc. Santayana
continued too. Presently he was
again quoted aloud, as follows:
"There is a sort of indifference to
time, as there is a sort of silence,
which goes with veritable sympathy.
. . . Those who are jealous, jealous
of time, of rivals, of accidents"
(here our girls emitted odd noises)
"care for something vague that es
capes them not . . . They are haunted
souls, hunting for they know not
what."
"Sort of like us. huh?"
"Yes, Streb."
"Ginny," Streb said, "it's eight
thirty."
"I know," Ginny grumbled. "Could
it be we're haunted souls hunting
for visitors?"
"Anyway, it's nice the Nurses'
Aides come to visit us."
And they began to console them
selves by talking seriously about the
Nurses' Aides. Many of them were
from Stanford, girls they'd seen on
Quad and in the Cellar. They were
doing good work at the hospital, giv
ing their time where it was greatly
needed, visiting all their patients
with smiles and help and encourage
ment. The Nurses' Aides were to be
admired and commended.
Nevertheless, a couple of hours
later a terrible, despairing "OH.
BIRD!" resounded through the dark
ness in the room. Just which one
of the girls it was who made this
closing comment is hard to tell. Per
haps the reader, who may be slight
ly acquainted with them, can decide.
Their names were
Lorrain Streblow
and
Virginia Clagett
P. S. Streb is still there, in Room
225. And visitors are still welcome,
with or without chocolate cake.
Listen to this," said the girl who
was flat on her back reading to the
girl who was enjoying a Cellar cig
arette, also flat on her back. " 'You
kneel on one knee, like a knight get
ting his sword . . . When you get
exhausted, you sit, but don't bend-
Honest, I know'."
A sort of sad giggle exploded in
the throat of the girl who was smok
ing. "Where," she asked, "are you
reading about us?"
"The New Yorker, July 7." The
first girl also made extraordinary,
sad sounds of amusement. "Only,
that's a description of picking straw
berries."
"Oh." And the second girl blew a
dreamy smoke ring. "I was sure it
was us."
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
"Still on the New Yorker?"
"Uuh-huh. I'm reading about Joe
E. Brown. Listen to this: 'Training
had enabled him to think practical
ly nothing of two fractures of the
spinal column'."
At this, a spectacular incoherence
seized them. The two girls (Stanford
girls, by the way) simply gave in to
hysterics.
"So that's why we're in the hos
pital!"
"We just weren't trained right!"
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
Only July 33th they celebrated
their anniversaries.
"One month ago tonight," mut
tered the first girl, "I didn't know
what hit me. And here I am."
"And two months ago," growled
the second girl, "I went on a hay
ride. And here we are."
"Oh. bird.'
"Oh, (word.)"
Who'd have thought, they both
mused, that they'd be graduating in
zipperless, no-stretch corsets, like a
couple of turtles? June 17th, cli

mactic clay. One of them in a hos
pital bed, visited by Dr. Tresidder
and Dr. Mitchell; the other gasping
in the hot sun, fearful that she oi
lier cast would melt and cause a
commotion.
But now that they were Stan
ford graduates, after all, they de
cided that they could educate them
selves. Besides, time sagged with
boredom. So the gill of The New
Yorker switched to The Moral Con
quest of Germany and often uttered
aloud things like, "Emil Ludwig says
that the Wellington symphony is
Beethoven's poorest."
And thus it was, time continued.
It came and went, etc. And so did
the hours.
"You know, I think maybe we're
unpopular. Or nobody knows we're
here. Or they've forgotten us, or . . "
"Might we run a want ad in the
Daily . . . ?"
"Or send out invitations? 'At
home, Palo Alto Hospital, 2:00 to
3:30 and 7:00 to 8:40'."
Obviously, more time passed, be
cause by now our reader of The
Magic Mountain had covered all TIG
pages of it and had begun an un
sentimental journey to Persons and
Places with George Santayana. "His
re-creation of the Harvard he knew,"
claimed the book jacket,' "is ex
quisitely nostalgic, but is without a
hint of sentimentality."

ting his sword . . . When you get
exhausted, you sit, but don't bend-
Honest, I know'."
A sort of sad giggle exploded in
the throat of the girl who was smok
ing. "Where," she asked, "are you
reading about us?"
"The New Yorker, July 7." The
first girl also made extraordinary,
sad sounds of amusement. "Only,
that's a description of picking straw
berries."
"Oh." And the second girl blew a
dreamy smoke ring. "I was sure it
was us."
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
"Still on the New Yorker?"
"Uuh-huh. I'm reading about Joe
E. Brown. Listen to this: 'Training
had enabled him to think practical
ly nothing of two fractures of the
spinal column'."
At this, a spectacular incoherence
seized them. The two girls (Stanford
girls, by the way) simply gave in to
hysterics.
"So that's why we're in the hos
pital!"
"We just weren't trained right!"
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
Only July 33th they celebrated
their anniversaries.
"One month ago tonight," mut
tered the first girl, "I didn't know
what hit me. And here I am."
"And two months ago," growled
the second girl, "I went on a hay
ride. And here we are."
"Oh. bird.'
"Oh, (word.)"
Who'd have thought, they both
mused, that they'd be graduating in
zipperless, no-stretch corsets, like a
couple of turtles? June 17th, cli

mactic clay. One of them in a hos
pital bed, visited by Dr. Tresidder
and Dr. Mitchell; the other gasping
in the hot sun, fearful that she oi
lier cast would melt and cause a
commotion.
But now that they were Stan
ford graduates, after all, they de
cided that they could educate them
selves. Besides, time sagged with
boredom. So the gill of The New
Yorker switched to The Moral Con
quest of Germany and often uttered
aloud things like, "Emil Ludwig says
that the Wellington symphony is
Beethoven's poorest."
And thus it was, time continued.
It came and went, etc. And so did
the hours.
"You know, I think maybe we're
unpopular. Or nobody knows we're
here. Or they've forgotten us, or . . "
"Might we run a want ad in the
Daily . . . ?"
"Or send out invitations? 'At
home, Palo Alto Hospital, 2:00 to
3:30 and 7:00 to 8:40'."
Obviously, more time passed, be
cause by now our reader of The
Magic Mountain had covered all TIG
pages of it and had begun an un
sentimental journey to Persons and
Places with George Santayana. "His
re-creation of the Harvard he knew,"
claimed the book jacket,' "is ex
quisitely nostalgic, but is without a
hint of sentimentality."
Deciding that such was not as im
possible as it appeared, they com
menced reviewing the Stanford of
1940, 41, and 42, with exquisite nos
talgia, and—perhaps—without senti
mentality. There was Daily Editor
Dwight Hutchinson, when Bruce Jes
sup was A.S.S.U. president, and on
Saturday afternoons the feminine
rooting section, row upon row of
heads of long, shining hair, waved
pom-poms for Frankie Albert and
the rest of the Indians. There was
that historic Back-to-the-Farm Day
in 1941 when a real, live horse gal
loped down the aisle of the Edu
cation Auditorium shooting a cap
pistol at the members of Mr. Farm
er's class in Contemporary Art.
There was Stanford's Fiftieth Anni
versary, with Dr. Wilbur and Herb
ert Hoover taking part in impressive
ceremonies, and with dancing after
wards on the Quad, lighted by a
powerful spotlight from the top of
the newly-dedicated Hoover Library.
And then there were the old
Dinah's and the old L'Omelette, both
destroyed by fires that burned up, as
well, a lot of old Stanford associ
ations and memories. And how many
people, our reminiscing girls wond
ered, know the origin of that me
morable line: "You can do it, Frank
ie, you can do it!" (Reprinted here
by courtesy of the Gaieties.) And
then there were those recurrent
blackouts, and that frantic Friday
night when practically all the wom
en in Union squashed themselves in
to an inside, windowless room to
study for the next morning's finals.
All this was hashed over between
them with exquisite nostalgia, and
you understand and of course, with
out a hint of sentimentaliay.
Time continued, etc. Santayana
continued too. Presently he was
again quoted aloud, as follows:
"There is a sort of indifference to
time, as there is a sort of silence,
which goes with veritable sympathy.
. . . Those who are jealous, jealous
of time, of rivals, of accidents"
(here our girls emitted odd noises)
"care for something vague that es
capes them not . . . They are haunted
souls, hunting for they know not
what."
"Sort of like us. huh?"
"Yes, Streb."
"Ginny," Streb said, "it's eight
thirty."
"I know," Ginny grumbled. "Could
it be we're haunted souls hunting
for visitors?"
"Anyway, it's nice the Nurses'
Aides come to visit us."
And they began to console them
selves by talking seriously about the
Nurses' Aides. Many of them were
from Stanford, girls they'd seen on
Quad and in the Cellar. They were
doing good work at the hospital, giv
ing their time where it was greatly
needed, visiting all their patients
with smiles and help and encourage
ment. The Nurses' Aides were to be
admired and commended.
Nevertheless, a couple of hours
later a terrible, despairing "OH.
BIRD!" resounded through the dark
ness in the room. Just which one
of the girls it was who made this
closing comment is hard to tell. Per
haps the reader, who may be slight
ly acquainted with them, can decide.
Their names were
Lorrain Streblow
and
Virginia Clagett
P. S. Streb is still there, in Room
225. And visitors are still welcome,
with or without chocolate cake.
Listen to this," said the girl who
was flat on her back reading to the
girl who was enjoying a Cellar cig
arette, also flat on her back. " 'You

the rest of the Indians. There was
that historic Back-to-the-Farm Day
in 1941 when a real, live horse gal
loped down the aisle of the Edu
cation Auditorium shooting a cap
pistol at the members of Mr. Farm
er's class in Contemporary Art.
There was Stanford's Fiftieth Anni
versary, with Dr. Wilbur and Herb
ert Hoover taking part in impressive
ceremonies, and with dancing after
wards on the Quad, lighted by a
powerful spotlight from the top of
the newly-dedicated Hoover Library.
And then there were the old
Dinah's and the old L'Omelette, both
destroyed by fires that burned up, as
well, a lot of old Stanford associ
ations and memories. And how many
people, our reminiscing girls wond
ered, know the origin of that me
morable line: "You can do it, Frank
ie, you can do it!" (Reprinted here
by courtesy of the Gaieties.) And
then there were those recurrent
blackouts, and that frantic Friday
night when practically all the wom
en in Union squashed themselves in
to an inside, windowless room to
study for the next morning's finals.
All this was hashed over between
them with exquisite nostalgia, and
you understand and of course, with
out a hint of sentimentaliay.
Time continued, etc. Santayana
continued too. Presently he was
again quoted aloud, as follows:
"There is a sort of indifference to
time, as there is a sort of silence,
which goes with veritable sympathy.
. . . Those who are jealous, jealous
of time, of rivals, of accidents"
(here our girls emitted odd noises)
"care for something vague that es
capes them not . . . They are haunted
souls, hunting for they know not
what."
"Sort of like us. huh?"
"Yes, Streb."
"Ginny," Streb said, "it's eight
thirty."
"I know," Ginny grumbled. "Could
it be we're haunted souls hunting
for visitors?"
"Anyway, it's nice the Nurses'
Aides come to visit us."
And they began to console them
selves by talking seriously about the
Nurses' Aides. Many of them were
from Stanford, girls they'd seen on
Quad and in the Cellar. They were
doing good work at the hospital, giv
ing their time where it was greatly
needed, visiting all their patients
with smiles and help and encourage
ment. The Nurses' Aides were to be
admired and commended.
Nevertheless, a couple of hours
later a terrible, despairing "OH.
BIRD!" resounded through the dark
ness in the room. Just which one
of the girls it was who made this
closing comment is hard to tell. Per

Listen to this," said the girl who
was flat on her back reading to the
girl who was enjoying a Cellar cig
arette, also flat on her back. " 'You
kneel on one knee, like a knight get
ting his sword . . . When you get
exhausted, you sit, but don't bend-
Honest, I know'."
A sort of sad giggle exploded in
the throat of the girl who was smok
ing. "Where," she asked, "are you
reading about us?"
"The New Yorker, July 7." The
first girl also made extraordinary,
sad sounds of amusement. "Only,
that's a description of picking straw
berries."
"Oh." And the second girl blew a
dreamy smoke ring. "I was sure it
was us."
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
"Still on the New Yorker?"
"Uuh-huh. I'm reading about Joe
E. Brown. Listen to this: 'Training
had enabled him to think practical
ly nothing of two fractures of the
spinal column'."
At this, a spectacular incoherence
seized them. The two girls (Stanford
girls, by the way) simply gave in to
hysterics.
"So that's why we're in the hos
pital!"
"We just weren't trained right!"
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
Only July 33th they celebrated
their anniversaries.
"One month ago tonight," mut
tered the first girl, "I didn't know
what hit me. And here I am."
"And two months ago," growled
the second girl, "I went on a hay
ride. And here we are."
"Oh. bird.'
"Oh, (word.)"
Who'd have thought, they both
mused, that they'd be graduating in
zipperless, no-stretch corsets, like a
couple of turtles? June 17th, cli

mactic clay. One of them in a hos
pital bed, visited by Dr. Tresidder
and Dr. Mitchell; the other gasping
in the hot sun, fearful that she oi
lier cast would melt and cause a
commotion.
But now that they were Stan
ford graduates, after all, they de
cided that they could educate them
selves. Besides, time sagged with
boredom. So the gill of The New
Yorker switched to The Moral Con
quest of Germany and often uttered
aloud things like, "Emil Ludwig says
that the Wellington symphony is
Beethoven's poorest."
And thus it was, time continued.
It came and went, etc. And so did
the hours.
"You know, I think maybe we're
unpopular. Or nobody knows we're
here. Or they've forgotten us, or . . "
"Might we run a want ad in the
Daily . . . ?"
"Or send out invitations? 'At
home, Palo Alto Hospital, 2:00 to
3:30 and 7:00 to 8:40'."
Obviously, more time passed, be
cause by now our reader of The
Magic Mountain had covered all TIG
pages of it and had begun an un
sentimental journey to Persons and
Places with George Santayana. "His
re-creation of the Harvard he knew,"
claimed the book jacket,' "is ex
quisitely nostalgic, but is without a
hint of sentimentality."
Deciding that such was not as im
possible as it appeared, they com
menced reviewing the Stanford of
1940, 41, and 42, with exquisite nos
talgia, and—perhaps—without senti
mentality. There was Daily Editor
Dwight Hutchinson, when Bruce Jes
sup was A.S.S.U. president, and on
Saturday afternoons the feminine
rooting section, row upon row of
heads of long, shining hair, waved
pom-poms for Frankie Albert and
the rest of the Indians. There was
