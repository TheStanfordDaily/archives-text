# REFLECTIONS SEEN ON A CEILING

Listen to this," said the girl who
was flat on her back reading to the
girl who was enjoying a Cellar cig
arette, also flat on her back. " 'You
kneel on one knee, like a knight get
ting his sword . . . When you get
exhausted, you sit, but don't bend-
Honest, I know'."
A sort of sad giggle exploded in
the throat of the girl who was smok
ing. "Where," she asked, "are you
reading about us?"
"The New Yorker, July 7." The
first girl also made extraordinary,
sad sounds of amusement. "Only,
that's a description of picking straw
berries."
"Oh." And the second girl blew a
dreamy smoke ring. "I was sure it
was us."
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
"Still on the New Yorker?"
"Uuh-huh. I'm reading about Joe
E. Brown. Listen to this: 'Training
had enabled him to think practical
ly nothing of two fractures of the
spinal column'."
At this, a spectacular incoherence
seized them. The two girls (Stanford
girls, by the way) simply gave in to
hysterics.
"So that's why we're in the hos
pital!"
"We just weren't trained right!"
Time continued. It came and went.
It stood still and yawned and blew
out the window swiftly and swiftly
back in again. It sagged with bore
dom.
Only July 33th they celebrated
their anniversaries.
"One month ago tonight," mut
tered the first girl, "I didn't know
what hit me. And here I am."
"And two months ago," growled
the second girl, "I went on a hay
ride. And here we are."
"Oh. bird.'
"Oh, (word.)"
Who'd have thought, they both
mused, that they'd be graduating in
zipperless, no-stretch corsets, like a
couple of turtles? June 17th, cli

mactic clay. One of them in a hos
pital bed, visited by Dr. Tresidder
and Dr. Mitchell; the other gasping
in the hot sun, fearful that she oi
lier cast would melt and cause a
commotion.
But now that they were Stan
ford graduates, after all, they de
cided that they could educate them
selves. Besides, time sagged with
boredom. So the gill of The New
Yorker switched to The Moral Con
quest of Germany and often uttered
aloud things like, "Emil Ludwig says
that the Wellington symphony is
Beethoven's poorest."
And thus it was, time continued.
It came and went, etc. And so did
the hours.
"You know, I think maybe we're
unpopular. Or nobody knows we're
here. Or they've forgotten us, or . . "
"Might we run a want ad in the
Daily . . . ?"
"Or send out invitations? 'At
home, Palo Alto Hospital, 2:00 to
3:30 and 7:00 to 8:40'."
Obviously, more time passed, be
cause by now our reader of The
Magic Mountain had covered all TIG
pages of it and had begun an un
sentimental journey to Persons and
Places with George Santayana. "His
re-creation of the Harvard he knew,"
claimed the book jacket,' "is ex
quisitely nostalgic, but is without a
hint of sentimentality."
Deciding that such was not as im
possible as it appeared, they com
menced reviewing the Stanford of
1940, 41, and 42, with exquisite nos
talgia, and—perhaps—without senti
mentality. There was Daily Editor
Dwight Hutchinson, when Bruce Jes
sup was A.S.S.U. president, and on
Saturday afternoons the feminine
rooting section, row upon row of
heads of long, shining hair, waved
pom-poms for Frankie Albert and
