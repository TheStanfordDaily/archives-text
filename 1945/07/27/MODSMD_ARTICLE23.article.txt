# Midnight Maneuvers
## 
### 
Special order 0001 of SCU 3905
specifically states that at 2230 all
lights shall be turned out, and AST's
shall retire. Neglecting the few
who stay up to seek more knowl
edge, it would be interesting to
study the general reaction to taps.
Now some Gl's actually go to sleep
after taps, though their motive for
this has never been discovered. May
be they are tired. Let them con
tinue their dreams and let us pro
t.
x here is the thinker. His mind re
hashes, ponders over, and plans new
and old circumstances. "Will I fail
this?" "Is she eager?" "Will my
girl find out?" Etc., etc. As for me,
I'd give a million to forget these
.hings.
Since childhood many persons
rnve carried over the habit of in
sisting on a bedtime story before
slumbering. Ghosts, girls, and
jhouls provide the best topics. The
larrator is often imported from
lown the hall.
Of course it is impossible to sleep
vith a huge amount of energy stored
ip and crying for freedom. Nothing
ike a good "tear the place up"
ough-house for a pre-slumber tonic.
The less ambitious content them
elves with short-sheeting their un
ortunate roommate.
Now there's a select group who
ion't believe in sleep. If a person
loesn't sleep at night, what can he
lo? He sure could go to town in
ome old hopped-up Buick. Oh well,
hat's his business.
What do I do? Now that's rather
mbarassing! Maybe we will say
hat I go to sleep just like everyone
Ise. . . .
