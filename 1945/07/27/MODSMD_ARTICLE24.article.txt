Ranting and Rioting
With the CE-4's
"Rifles aren't the only things with
telescopic sights," the CE-4's wil
tell you as you inquire why all the
transits point in one direction or
Surveying Hill. Sun bathing is j
great institution in the fair state ol
California.
The '30 Buick is rapidly becoming
the Scourge of SCU 3905. What's
more, it is just like a P-38; that is
it is often mistaken for a P-38 be
cause of its ability to reproduce
sounds. Naturally, Manus, Pine anc
Goodal, incorporated are the sole
owners of the '"thing."
Just how did this grand conglom
eration of super-morons come to ex
ist? Well, "onct pon a time" we were
all taking basic training in the tough
est and roughest camp in the nation
(List ol camps too long to include.)
Someone decided that we would
make a good bunch of engineers,
the dear, dear boy. So this choice
collodion pre-Meds, chemists, bi
ologists, psych majors and journal
ists was sent to join the campus
commandos at Stanford. We were
immediately considered excellent
material for Runyon's Rangers in C
Company. However one month
proved to the higher authorities
that we would do better in A Com
pany as Isaac's Infants. (No reflec
tion on remainder of company.)
Have you heard the one about how
the marines planted the lone star on
top of Sarubachi at Iwo? And how
Texas is the best darn state in this
whole nation? Of course you know
that the union joined Texas in 1846.
Ask Howard M. "Dimples" Bunch,
that fine (?) upstanding (?) ex
ample of a southern gentleman(?).
Progressive education at Roches
ter, N.Y., in the person of the great
Liberman also came to Stanford. He
is the man who fits up the ERC's
with gas masks just for the devil
ment of it. Or is it just for the devil
ment of it. We smell dissention in
our ranks at the hand of "Mad with
Power" Gentile from CCNY. Cur
rent and choice is his job of spray
ing the shower rooms with a solu
tion of formaldehyde. (CHOH)
And then, what more can be said
about the terror of Lagunita Court,
Bert Feinberg.
Echoing down the halls at night
is not "Laura" but the lusty Cal
versions of all the dear old Stan
ford songs. A., "The Oakland Kid"
McGuinness was contributed by the
Golden State and represents the best
at the U. of Cal.
And so fades away our little saga
of what should never have hit Stan
ford: a complete rundown of this
crew requires volumes. With these
boys the pace is a laugh a minute
in low gear. Ah, yes! What a com
bination.â€”Russell Figert.
