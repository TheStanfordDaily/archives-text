Monday marked the end of "in
duction week" and things have be
gun to come back to normal. No
longer will Bradshaw be seen run
ning through the halls in his un
mentionables after taps.
The favorite gathering place for
the ERC's after study hours seems
to be room 109 where they listen
open-mouthed to bedtime stories —
incidentally, is it true what they say
about Feinberg?
Famous last words: CAPTAIN—
"Private, that remark was uncalled
for." ERC—Sir, if it's not called for
in thirty days you may have it."
With the collapse of the after
taps sandwich and malt service by
way of a certain speedy Buick, many
a man is seen filching that extra
orange from chow.
Speaking of wood, have you given
a listen to "that Man" with the
licorice stick in the GI band? Who
knows, maybe "Swing and Sway
with Sammy Kaye" will give way to
"Swing and Swear with Walter
Fleher." Incidentally, the only com
plaint registered from this quarter
is that not enough of la femmes
frequent the weekly hoedowns. If
you are a gal come along.
