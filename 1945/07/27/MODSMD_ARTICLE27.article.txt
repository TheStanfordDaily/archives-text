### JIM WELTER 
'"When champions fall, they fall
hard" was apparently proven true
last Wednesday night when the
EE-G's, undefeated and far ahead in
the Co. A Softball league, absorbed
a 17-5 lacing at the hands of the
CE-4's. Pitcher Wolf held the CE-14
batters in check until the third in
ning. A few hits, a couple walks,
and Welter's three-run homer gave
the Civils five runs. Not content
with a 5-1 lead, they came back in
the following inning and turned hits,
passes, and errors into nine more
counters.
The ME-G's kept up their winning
ways in the Co. C league by soundly
trouncing the last place CE-5
(Tigers?) to a tune of 17-0. Good
fielding support plus eight strikeouts
netted Pitcher Hust a shutout vic
tory.
Reenlivening their challenge to
the leaders, the CE-5 (Coots) took
an 11-7 decision from the E-l, T-3
outfit. In the Co. A league, the
ME-4's, who last week won their
first game, succumbed. 9-4, to the
E-l, T-3's.
The ERC league witnessed the
first defeat of 3c and 4c with the
unbeaten 4a & 4b ten performing the
(ask by an 11-8 margin. One other
ERC aggregation remained in the
undefeated column—2b & 5b bowled
over the hapless lc Sr. 2a group. 8-5.
By outslugging sb-2& sc, 13-11, the
3a&3b's moved out of the cellar
leaving that lowly position for their
victims and the above mentioned
lc&2a's.
Trailing by 13-5, the 2c&sa outfit
made a story-book finish. Third
baseman Osserman led off what later
proved to be "the lucky seventh"
with a rousing triple. That blow set
off the spark for nine runs which
proceeded to be scored, thus giving
the 2c & sa's a 14-13 verdict.

About two-thirds of the first
round matches have now been played
off in the ASTP tennis, ping-pong,
and horseshoe tournaments. The
deadline for these matches has been
set at 7 p. 111. Sunday. First and
second round ping-pong pairings are
being decided by the two games out
of three method. Third round, semi
finals, and finals matches will be
changed to a three out of five basis.
Except for the fact that there are
only four rounds, a similar setup is
used for the tennis playoffs.
Approximately forty contestants
will attempt to splash their way into
the swimming finals which are to be
held on August 11. The events will
take place in the Men's Pool.

ning. A few hits, a couple walks,
and Welter's three-run homer gave
the Civils five runs. Not content
with a 5-1 lead, they came back in
the following inning and turned hits,
passes, and errors into nine more
counters.
The ME-G's kept up their winning
ways in the Co. C league by soundly
trouncing the last place CE-5
(Tigers?) to a tune of 17-0. Good
fielding support plus eight strikeouts
netted Pitcher Hust a shutout vic
tory.
Reenlivening their challenge to
the leaders, the CE-5 (Coots) took
an 11-7 decision from the E-l, T-3
outfit. In the Co. A league, the
ME-4's, who last week won their
first game, succumbed. 9-4, to the
E-l, T-3's.
The ERC league witnessed the
first defeat of 3c and 4c with the
unbeaten 4a & 4b ten performing the
(ask by an 11-8 margin. One other
ERC aggregation remained in the
undefeated column—2b & 5b bowled
over the hapless lc Sr. 2a group. 8-5.
By outslugging sb-2& sc, 13-11, the
3a&3b's moved out of the cellar
leaving that lowly position for their
victims and the above mentioned
lc&2a's.
Trailing by 13-5, the 2c&sa outfit
made a story-book finish. Third
baseman Osserman led off what later
proved to be "the lucky seventh"
with a rousing triple. That blow set
off the spark for nine runs which
proceeded to be scored, thus giving
the 2c & sa's a 14-13 verdict.

About two-thirds of the first
round matches have now been played
off in the ASTP tennis, ping-pong,
and horseshoe tournaments. The
deadline for these matches has been
set at 7 p. 111. Sunday. First and
second round ping-pong pairings are
being decided by the two games out
of three method. Third round, semi
finals, and finals matches will be
changed to a three out of five basis.
Except for the fact that there are
only four rounds, a similar setup is
used for the tennis playoffs.
Approximately forty contestants
will attempt to splash their way into
the swimming finals which are to be
held on August 11. The events will
take place in the Men's Pool.
