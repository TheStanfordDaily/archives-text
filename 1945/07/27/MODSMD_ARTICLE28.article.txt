A new, and I think better, system
of rating baseball pitchers has been
developed by Ted Oliver, who has
done a great deal of work on the
statistical side of baseball, which
rates pitchers not by their winning
percentage or earned run average,
but on the basis of the team back
ing them up. Oliver's theory is ex
tremely well founded, for through
out the history of modern baseball
many great pitchers did not have
teams behind them that would pro
duce runs to win 1-0, and 2-1 ball
games. Certainly a pitcher that
wins 15 games for a sixth place club
is better than a chucker that hurls
15 wins for a first division outfit;
Oliver's "weighted rating scale"
goes to prove just that.
The mathematics of the weighted
rating system is surprisingly simple:
Let A equal the winning percentage
of the team without the benefit of

the games of the pitcher to be rated.
Let B equal the winning percentage
of the pitcher, and let C stand for
the total number of contests that the
pitcher has completed. The answer
is found by the use of the formula
X equals C (B-A).
The tremendous difference in rat
ing pitchers is shown by this scale.
Let us put it to use on some of the
top hurlers in the P.C.L.
This is the way it stands accord
ing to won-lost records:

Beasley, (Sac.) 8 1 .889
Joyce, (S.F.) 22 7 .761
Pulford, (Port.) 16 7 .696
Helser, (Port.) 15 7 .GB2
Liska, (Port.) 15 7 .682
Fischer, (Seattle) .... 15 7 .682
Eaves, (S.D.) 16 9 .640
Fletcher, (Sac.) 16 9 .640
Cohen, (Port.) 8 5 .615
Dumler, (S.D.) 14 0 .609
Mann, (Oakland) .... 9 6 .600
Note the difference in standings
when the pitchers are rated accord
ing to the weighted rating scale.
