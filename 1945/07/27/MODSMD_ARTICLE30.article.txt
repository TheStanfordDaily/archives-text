Due to lack of space, it is not
possible to give an account of the
rest of the inning, but it is interest
ing to note that after the game, both
teams got together and gave a Big
Six for the umpire.
The following, a more or less com
plete account of the fourth inning
of the Monroe-Arthur soft ball game,
played last Tuesday, is here pre
sented as an excellent example of
the deplorable umpire situation in
the soft ball league. The score is
7-0 in favor of Monroe and Arthur
has just taken the field:
Umpire: Steerike one.
Arthur pitcher: That was just a
warm up pitch, the batter isn't in
the box yet.
Umpire: I called "Batter up"; the
count's 1 and 0.
A. Pitcher: I should argue.
Umpire: Stee-rike two.
A. Catcher: Oh no.
(The pitcher throws the ball and
"Bingle" Maguire throws down his
bat and steps out of the box.)
Maguire: Good as gold.
Umpire: Ball one.
Bechter (from sidelines): You got
on the dark glasses, Ump, now all
you need is the dog.
Umpire: Stee-rike three. (The
catcher runs up into the stands to
retrieve the ball as the next batter
steps up. He hits a dribbler to short
and fails to beat the throw.)
Umpire: You're out, I guess. . . .
Get off the base, I said you're out.
Peake: What if I don't feel like it?
Umpire: Get off or I'll throw you
out of the game.
Peake: You'll what?
Umpire: Aw please, be a good guy
and get off the base. (Peake does
so and the third batter flies out to
right, retiring the side.)
Umpire (to Monroe pitcher Bob
Rosburg): You Monroe boys better
wise up. All these teams are laying

for you guys. They hate your in
nards, see What did you call
me?
Rosburg: I didn't call you any
thing, I just said you were back
ward. (Rosburg walks the first batter
and the second man steps up to the
plate.
Umpire: (to Rosburg: You're us
ing an illegal pitch.
Rosburg: And what are you going
to do about it?
Umpire: Nothing, I just thought
you ought to know.(The second
batter gets on on an error and num
ber three makes it to first by hit
ting a line drive into the Umpire.
The bases are loaded with Morris
at bat.)
Umpire: Strike one. (Morrison
wipes the dust off his ankles.)
