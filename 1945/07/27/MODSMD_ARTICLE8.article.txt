# 'Wash' Dance On Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Second Annual Summer
Wash Bowl dance will be given to
morrow night at Washington hall.
"Come race in our basin" or "If
you gotta date, stop her at the wash
bowl" say the enthusiastic sponsors
of the sport dance which will be
held from 9 to 1 a.m.
The windows of the hall will be
blocked out on the second floor with
tar paper cut with block letters
spelling "WASH BOWL" and lit from
behind so that the dance will be
well advertised from the outside.
Nice slow, sweet music of the best
bands will be played with a very
large selection of records for re
quests. "Some rooms," says John
Jenkins, one of the Washington in
mates, "will have low lights, and in
other rooms they'll be even lower."
Wash bowls and "other equip
ment" will be adequately distributed
for decorations, and there's a rumor
afoot that the front door will be
designed along especially appropri
ate lines.
Sheet cakes and"the best fruit
punch that has been made on
campus" will be the refreshments
at the Wash Bowl dance, which is
open to the public without charge.
