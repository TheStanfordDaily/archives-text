### BERT BILL 
There is one group of men here in the ASTP with
out whom life would be very miserable indeed. These
are the members of the ERC; that select group of in
dividuals who, are too young to face the hardships of
the rugged army life and who are too old to remain in
high school. We adopt them with a motherly instinct
and try to teach them not the right way to do things,
not the wrong way, but the army way.
However it also works the other way around, for the
members of the younger generation can tell us a
few things too. But we love them, and because of
their kind souls we can sleep thru reville and awake to
find our Httle helpers busily cleaning the room. Be
cause of them there are always men available for de
tails when the "blue-braided boys" are tired, and be
cause of them there are always willing ears to listen
to the romantic saga of Basic Training. They have
come to Stanford with memories of a staid dreary
civilian life and will leave as hardened men in Uncle
Sam's employ.
What a transformation!!

Why is it that some men (like Wolf) can get places
with Lagunita women, and others (like Dimples
Bunch) cannot? If this dilemma faces you, seek the
expert advice of our "Advice to the Lovelorn and men
who have over 13 demerits" Editor. Mamma Diegoli.
