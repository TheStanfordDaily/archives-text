### MEEMI 
There is one group of men here on campus without
whom life would be very joyous indeed. These are the
members of the AST who are too wise to face the
hardships of war and not too young to appreciate the
beauties of Lagunita. We adopt them with a motherly
(?) instinct and try to teach them not the right way
to do things, not the wrong way, but ....
But we love them, and because of their kind souls
and their expert knowledge in beating the telephone
company out of nickels they keep us in the phone
booths all night when were just dying to study. Be
cause of them there are always men available, and
because of them there are always cameras ready to
snap the romantic saga of Stanford. They have come
to Stanford with memories—and they will leave . . . .
What a transformation.

"Can you get me three good dates?"—Simmons.
"It's all because of the Captain."—Bert.
"Say, you all, haven't you heard of Wichita Falls,
Texas?"— Dimples Bunch.
"I'm madly in love."—Bill
"I'm not tight."—Mac.
"Bert's borrowed my money."—The Whole AST.

The formal Saturday promises to be the biggest event
on campus this quarter. Dancing to the smoothest
music of Bert Whiting and his orchestra, we'll expect
to see all the ASTs—especially Bill. Mac. Vic, Dimples
. . . and of course Dimples. If the Captain is willing
we'll see Bert.
