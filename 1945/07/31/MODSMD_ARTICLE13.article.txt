### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Everybody is wondering what changes, if any. will
result from the amazing British election. A close look,
though, will reveal that internally there will be a
change of form, but not of substance, and. externally,
there will be a change of degree.
The internal policy of the National Conservatives
was the preservation of "free enterprise." The Labor
ites could easily reply to this with the truth, that there
was no such thing in the basic industries because all
of them were controlled by some sort of cartel or
monopoly arrangement. Thus they change from private
monopoly to a public monopoly, and that is about all.
EFFICIENCY
It remains to be seen how efficient the public monop
oly will be. Sir Stafford Cripps is president of the
Board of Trade, and as such he will be the top figure
in the government control. He is perhaps the most bril
liant man in present day England, except for G.8.5..
and he might handle everything quite well. On the
other hand, if the industries taken over are run like
the government-operated telephone system, there will
be a change at the next general election.
The next big pillar of Labor policy was the nation
alization of the Bank of England. The Tory Chancellor
of the Exchequer had so much power over credit any
way that the bank was free only in theory, and all
the Labor majority can do is confirm this situation.
FOREIGN POLICY
The British Labor Party is primarily a trade union
movement with socialistic inclinations. It hopes to
evolve towards a classless society, or Communism, but
it hopes to do so without bloodshed. It has often
turned down offers of juncture made by the British
Communist Party, and this is fairly decent proof of its
good intentions.
But the laborites must realize that the British
Communist state is as far off as true Communism in
Russia, which is a great distance, and thus they will
conduct their foreign policy accordingly.
They will not take a second seat to Russia, allowing
the Russian brand of Communism to take over, be
cause they are Englishmen and believe in Socialism
as increased—not decreased—liberty. The Now-Pre
mier Clement Atlee also stood publicly behind Mr.
Churchill's intervention in Greece, which should show
the Socialism in England doesn't mean the OGPU in
the rest of Europe.
However, the British Labor Party promised an ac
cord with Stalin, and that means less suspicion than
Churchill had toward him. It means there will be
more sympathy toward Russia, but still an active check
to any overly-aggressive acts, and thus the new foreign
policy will be a change only in its intensity and the
heat of its feeling-
