# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the person who commandeered
my bicycle from in front of the
Cellar on July 21.
Dear Sir:
The bicycle was recovered from
the corner of Bayshore highway and
University Avenue where you so
kindly parked it behind an ice shed.
Amazingly it only cost the University
and Palo Alto Police Departments
two days of constant lookout, and it
only cost me a few extra hours of
walking to meet my classes and a
gallon or so of gas to go down to
retrieve it. But I really needed the
exercise provided by walking and
had no better way to vise the gas;
so when you wish to use it again,
it will be in the rack at the Cellar
—just take it any time you want.
Here 1 have a noteworthy sug
gestion. If you are the person who
has been borrowing all the bicycles
that have been borrowd on campus
lately, why not contact the fellows
and girls who are dependent on
them for transportation and after
they have finished polishing your
eyes and shortening and flattening
your nose—maybe they will all chip
in a few cents apiece to buy you a
nice, shiny bicycle all of your very
own.
Sincerely,
—YOUR BENEFACTOK.

Which Way Or eat Britain?
The editorial in Friday's paper
maintained that "for the first time in
British history, the century-old
promise of a Socialist milennium
had been entered into with the
peoples eyes wide open" and that
"last century's greatest stronghold
of imperialist philosophy and en
trenched toryism has in a bold
gesture become this decade's most
startling anachronism."
It seems somewhat early to in
terpret the elections in this manner.
We have not yet seen the new
government in action—perhaps the
gesture will not turn out to be so
bold. We cannot tell, as yet, how
widely the people's eyes are open.
Twice before, in 1923 and 1929, the
Labour Party won elections cam
paigning on socialistic platforms.
True, on those occasions, unlike now,
the Labour Party did gain an out
right majority. This prevented them
to some extent from carrying out
the promised reforms. Both times,
however, the Labour government be
came quickly unpopular, lasting
only ten months and two yeax-s,
respectively.

Other European countries have al
so had administrations with views
similar to those of the Labour Party.
France, Germany, Spain and Austria
all had socialistic governments at
some time between the two wars.
None of them made any great
changes. Most of them made half
hearted attempts at reform, ending
in dismal failure.
There is often a great difference
between campaign platforms and
consequent actions, but perhaps the
British people and politicians have
matured. It is too early to say. Our
analyses, our fears, and our hopes
should wait until we have some
facts to base them on.

To the person who commandeered
my bicycle from in front of the
Cellar on July 21.
Dear Sir:
The bicycle was recovered from
the corner of Bayshore highway and
University Avenue where you so
kindly parked it behind an ice shed.
Amazingly it only cost the University
and Palo Alto Police Departments
two days of constant lookout, and it
only cost me a few extra hours of
walking to meet my classes and a
gallon or so of gas to go down to
retrieve it. But I really needed the
exercise provided by walking and
had no better way to vise the gas;
so when you wish to use it again,
it will be in the rack at the Cellar
—just take it any time you want.
Here 1 have a noteworthy sug
gestion. If you are the person who
has been borrowing all the bicycles
that have been borrowd on campus
lately, why not contact the fellows
and girls who are dependent on
them for transportation and after
they have finished polishing your
eyes and shortening and flattening
your nose—maybe they will all chip
in a few cents apiece to buy you a
nice, shiny bicycle all of your very
own.
Sincerely,
—YOUR BENEFACTOK.

Which Way Or eat Britain?
The editorial in Friday's paper
maintained that "for the first time in
British history, the century-old
promise of a Socialist milennium
had been entered into with the
peoples eyes wide open" and that
"last century's greatest stronghold
of imperialist philosophy and en
trenched toryism has in a bold
gesture become this decade's most
startling anachronism."
It seems somewhat early to in
terpret the elections in this manner.
We have not yet seen the new
government in action—perhaps the
gesture will not turn out to be so
bold. We cannot tell, as yet, how
widely the people's eyes are open.
Twice before, in 1923 and 1929, the
Labour Party won elections cam
paigning on socialistic platforms.
True, on those occasions, unlike now,
the Labour Party did gain an out
right majority. This prevented them
to some extent from carrying out
the promised reforms. Both times,
however, the Labour government be
came quickly unpopular, lasting
only ten months and two yeax-s,
respectively.

Other European countries have al
so had administrations with views
similar to those of the Labour Party.
France, Germany, Spain and Austria
all had socialistic governments at
some time between the two wars.
None of them made any great
changes. Most of them made half
hearted attempts at reform, ending
in dismal failure.
There is often a great difference
between campaign platforms and
consequent actions, but perhaps the
British people and politicians have
matured. It is too early to say. Our
analyses, our fears, and our hopes
should wait until we have some
facts to base them on.
