# Lagunita-Roble Formal Bids Go On Sale; Whiting To Play
## 
### DOT ESCHERICH 
Committees are working frantical
ly to finish lavish preparations, and
today the tickets are on sale at
Lagunita and Roble for Hua Hao
Yueh Yuan, their summer formal.
Thursday the general public will
be given a chance at the ASSU of
fice to purchase the ducats, which
Ruth Altucker, chairman of the
dance, was overheard saying were
selling like hotcakes already.
Bert Whiting Plays
Not only will there be dancing
to the slow rhythms of Bert Whit
ing with his 10 piece orchestra and
vocalist, Sonia Shaw, but there will
be an floor show during
intermission featuring Chinese danc
ers from campus.
Jackie Miller, Roble, and Mimi
Krauskopf, Lagunita, will arrange
a few blind dates for the shy types
who want to go to this boy-ask-girl
affair, although 'tis said that the
Farm men heartily object to this,
saying "What's wrong with us?
what has a blind date got that we
haven't got?" Who knows?

Decorations Authentic
Murals and Chinese characters
will decorate the inside of the gym,
and an abundance of flowers will be
found both inside and out. Miniature
Chinese bridges will sit atop the
tables which will be placed in the
court. AH of these features are as
suredly authentic since a group of
Chinese students, headed by Dorothy
Chin, is assisting the work of the
decorations committee.
Ruth Altucker and Jackie Miller
are co-chairmen of the dance, and
Betty Ann Porter is treasurer. Hazel
Spore, Lagunita, and Joan Crane,
Roble, are in charge of arrange
ments and cleanup. Publicity is be
ing handled by Camile Trosy and
Dorothy McGuire. Elaine Skahan se
cured the patrons, and Beaty O'Hair
arranged for the orchestra.
The Chinese students originated
the name, Hua Hao Yueh Yuan
(who-ah how you-er you-on) which
means something to the effect of a
romantic scene with a moon and
flowers, which is an apt prediction
for next Saturday night.
