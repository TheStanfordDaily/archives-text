### 
''The honor system at Stanford is
successful because public opinion
has been crystallized against the
cheater to such an extent that stu
dents themselves are willing to as
sume the initiative in protecting the
honesty of the individual," stated
Dr. Maxwell H. Savelle, Stanford
professor of history, at USC Tuesday.
Dr. Savelle is visiting professor at
USC for the summer session.
Stressing the importance of student
government in making the honor
code successful, Professor Savelle
pointed out that the system is based
on student authority and student
discipline, with the professor report
ing cheating not to the administra
tion but to the student council di
rectly.
Discipline for cheating is admin
istered from the men's and wom
en's council, not from the faculty,
Dr. Savelle explained.
"One of the essential elements in
the establishment of an honor code
is the carrying out of punishment
of violators." said Professor Savelle.
"The students themselves must
crack down and crack down hard.
The system cannot be put into effect
without wholehearted co-operation
of public opinion within the student
body."
Dr. Savelle concluded by empha
sizing that it is a student question
and must be instigated by their
realization of the need for honesty.
