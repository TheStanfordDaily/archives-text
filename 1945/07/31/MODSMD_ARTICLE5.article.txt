# 'Coach Returns in Fall' Says Masters
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
Graduate Manager Al Masters
helped yesterday to straighten us
out on a "few hazy points in refer
ence to Stanford's return to inter
collegiate athletics. "The student
body government itself killed the re
turn to football this year." said
Masters. The reason they gave was
the manpower shortage. We students
cannot very well complain about the
unwillingress of the administration
to return to football if the students
we elect to represent us are the ones
who voted against having football
in '45. •
Coach Not Chosen
As far as getting a coach for the
'46 eleven goes. Masters simply said,
"Nothing definite yet." He said,
however, that James Lawson. now
in the N;.vy, has resigned and that
Marchie Schwartz, also on leave, is
now acting head coach. The "Chron
icle" was just blowing through its
bugle again when Bill Leiser.

Masters said he feared that Stan
ford's chances of having a suc
cessful team next year might not
be as good as they are this Fall
for the simple reason thai other
Sschools will be grabbing up the
prospects for a whole year to

U.C.L.A.. and U.S.C. have been
turning out teams even during
wartime, a good investment for
future teams.
Basketball First
Basketball will be the first sport
on the docket in the return to con
ference. and here again it looks as
though Stanford might have turned
out a better team last season with
Morley Thompson. Dave Brown, and
Jack Heald as a nucleus, but De
cember is a long way off and we
can only hope that the fact that


ALFRED R. MASTERS
Stanford will have basketball will
draw many potential cagers here and
tie up with what help we may get
from the 300 Navy trainees to turn
out a top team.
"Coach Everett Dean." Masters
informed us, "will be back from
bis army training job in October."
This means that we will be a little
late in starting basketball, but
there will still be plenty of time
to develop a team. In reply to the
recent rumor that Stanford will not
be able to travel any great dis
tance to play conference games.
Masters stated that right now this
fact is true due to the increased
demand by the armed forces of the
necessary transportation facilities.
"But," he added, "things might he
different by basketball season."
This does not mean, thank good
ness, that Stanford will not be able
to play California, and there are
several top-notch service teams that
are probably better than the best
college team. No schedule has been
set up yet by Stanford, but the
conference has not decided on one
I yet either.
B.A.C. to Reorganize
All that remains to be done is the
reorganization of the Board of
Athletic Control, an organization de
funct since the withdrawal of Stan
j ford from the conference. "The
Alumni . Association has already
chosen three representatives,''
said Masters, "we can really get to
work when the faculty and the stu
; dents epch appoint or elect their
j three representatives.
