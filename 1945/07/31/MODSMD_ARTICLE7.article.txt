# Not Blue War Paint
## 
### 
As you probably observed yesterday while making the
rounds of your classes, our Quad, P.O. and Pavilion have been
branded in blue. Lee Webb and his two workmen spent the
whole of yesterday morning applying lye, lacquer, steel wool,
etc., to the damaged cement and sandstone —but still an outline
of the "U.C." was visible as the paint had soaked into the pores
of the cement.
The painting probably took place Saturday night.
But that is as far as our conjectures can go. In view of the
recent exchanges of good feeling and agreements between the

student body representatives of Cal and Stan
ford, we find it impossible to place the blame
unqualifiedly on Cal students.
If we allow the "prankster painters" who so
diligently spaced out
UNIV.
OF
CALIFORNIA
on the entrance floor of the Pavilion to undo our
so-far successful attempts to cement relationships
between Cal and Farm students, we would be

allowing a chipped lead pencil to stop our signing a truce.
Of the painting, Bob Kennedy, A.S.S.U. president, and Betsy
Rabbitt, vice-president, say:
"We should ignore any such manifestation either on the part
of high school students or certain members of the Cal student
body who do not realize the seriousness of the situation in view
of the recent friendly agreements made between the student body
officers of the two universities.''
