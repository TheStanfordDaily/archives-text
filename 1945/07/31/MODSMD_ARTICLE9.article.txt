### CYCLONE COVEY 
PILLOW TO POST, currently cutting loose at the
Stanford, is a surprising adaptation of a stage comedy
to the screen.

Only toward the last does it re
vert to its stage antecedents and be
come involved in the implausible
complexities of a junior-class high
school play.
But even then it keeps mo
mentum.
No sense in going into the plot—
which is what you can never get
across to movie reviewers—for the
best plots sound prosaic in synopsis;
it is their handling that determines
a movie's merit.

Pillow to Post is handled well, particularly insofar
as Ida Lupino does the handling. Her characterization
in fact is the hulk of the picture's justification. We
have here the refreshing phenomenon of a Hollywood
leading lady who (1) can act, (2) looks fetching enough,
and who is neither (3) insipid, (4) overaffected, nor
(5) hardboiled.
The balance of the film's justification is that it is
genuinely funny. Which is also a refreshing phe
nomenon.
These movie titles are getting denser and denser.
What "Pillow to Post" means, I have not the slightest
inkling.

TWO O'CLOCK COURAGE is another Falcon mys
tery, and not bad. Here and there it even crops out
with some of that occasional B-picture ingenunity; as
for instance, when occurs a long close-up of the im
mobile face and glazed eyes of a man slowly regaining
consciousness and recalling what went before.
Ann Rutherford is another of those Hollywood
glamor girls who keeps her lips well slobbered over.
