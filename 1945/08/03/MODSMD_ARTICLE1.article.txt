# 200 NROTC MEN TO COME IN FALL
## Toyon to House Navy Students 
### 
A Naval Reserve Officer Training
Corps unit with an initial quota
of 200 men will be established here
at the beginning of the autumn
quarter next month. President Don

The program of instruction for
NROTC officer candidates has been
scheduled to coincide with that
for Stanford civilian students,
hoth groups registering for fall
quarter on September 24. The
Navy men will be housed in Toyon
Hall, former dormitory for upper
class civilian men. and will he

Secretary of the Navy James
Forrestal announced on May 1 that
Stanford had been selected as one
of 25 universities and colleges to re

the regular Navy, as well as ofii
cers for the Naval Reserve and the
Marine Corps. As facilities at the

proportion of the future officers for
the regular Navy, as well as ofii

Naval Academy are not adequate
to provide the number of officers
needed for the postwar Navy, uni
versities and colleges with an
NROTC unit will give naval officer
candidates an education commensu
rate with that given at Annapolis.

Final arrangements for the new
NROTC unit were completed this
week when six officers from the
Bureau of Naval Personnel in
Washington, D.C., headed by Cap
tain Arthur S. Adams, USN
(ret.), arrived on the campus for
a two-day inspection tour Wed
nesday. Stanford is the twenty
first institution which the group
has visited in its current tour,
traveling in a special naval air
transport plane.
Carefully Chosen Men
For the duration of the war,
trainees in the NROTC program will
be carefully selected on an aptitude
basis from enlisted personnel on ac
tive duty at shore stations or with
the fleet. Approximately three
fourths of the men will be entering
the program as freshmen, the re
mainder having advanced training.
According to the present Navy cal
endar, the NROTC program is 11
quarters in length with a minimum
load of 17 units per quarter, requir
ing two and two-thirds years for
completion. It will be the equival

ent of a regular four-year college
course and will lead to a reserve
commission >n ihe Navy.
While enrolled in the NROTC
program, the men will have the
rank of apprentice seaman, will
wear regular Navy uniforms, and
will he subject to naval discipline.
Trainees will he permitted to par
ticipate in athletics and other ex
tra-curricular activities, except
that participation in inter-col
legiate athletics is prohibited dur
ing the first quarter in the pro
gram. The Navy also stipulates
that NROTC men must not leave
the campus for more than 48 hours
at a time when engaged in inter
collegiate sports.
Qualifications
In order to qualify for entrance
into NROTC. the enlisted men must
be American citizens, less than 23
years of age on July 1, 1945, un
married and agreed to remain so
until commissioned or otherwise
separated from the program. They
must be high school graduates or

six quarters of college work. Each
man must be recommended un

on the Navy General Classification
Test must disclose that he would lie
in the top 16 per cent of a normal
distribution of high school gradu
ates.
All NROTC students are required
to take the following naval science
courses, comprising 54 quarter hours
of instruction:
Freshman year—seamanship and
image control; sophomore year—
ordnance and fire control; junior
year—naval engineering, navigation
and ship control; senior year —
communications and tactics, naval
administration, seminar.
In the academic sphere. Captain
Adams indicated that the Navy De

requirements which NROTC students
must meet, the remainder of their
course being left to their individual
choice:
1) By the end of the sophomore

In order to qualify for entrance
into NROTC. the enlisted men must

six quarters of college work. Each
man must be recommended un

All NROTC students are required
to take the following naval science
courses, comprising 54 quarter hours
of instruction:
Freshman year—seamanship and
image control; sophomore year—
ordnance and fire control; junior
year—naval engineering, navigation

In the academic sphere. Captain
Adams indicated that the Navy De

requirements which NROTC students
must meet, the remainder of their
course being left to their individual
choice:
1) By the end of the sophomore
year, each student shall have com

assure his successful completion of
the course in naval engineering.
2) Also by the end of the
sophomore year, each student shall

trigonometry in order to assure
his successful undertaking of the
course in navigation and ship con

3) Each student, before his grad

offers its civilian students and, up
on fulfilling the University re
quirements for a degree in a cer

The officers who will teach the
naval science course will be given
equivalent ranks on the Stanford
faculty and will become an integral
part of that faculty.
A Naval Reserve Officer Training
Corps unit with an initial quota
of 200 men will be established here
at the beginning of the autumn
quarter next month. President Don
ald B. Tresidder announced.
The program of instruction for
NROTC officer candidates has been
scheduled to coincide with that
for Stanford civilian students,
hoth groups registering for fall
quarter on September 24. The
Navy men will be housed in Toyon
Hall, former dormitory for upper
class civilian men. and will he

Other Units
Secretary of the Navy James
Forrestal announced on May 1 that
Stanford had been selected as one
of 25 universities and colleges to re
ceive NROTC units, in addition to
the 27 then in operation. Recent leg
islation expanded the NROTC pro
gram from 7,200 to 24,000 men until

one year alter the war and raised
the permanent peacetime quota to
14.900.
The primary purpose of the ex
panded NROTC program is to pro
vide a continuing source of junior
officer material for the Navy, not
only during the war emergency but
also for the postwar period. With
blueprints now being drawn up for
a larger peacetime Navy than the
United States has ever had. the Navy
Department plans to utilize the post
war NROTC to train a considerable
proportion of the future officers for
the regular Navy, as well as ofii
cers for the Naval Reserve and the
Marine Corps. As facilities at the
Naval Academy are not adequate
to provide the number of officers
needed for the postwar Navy, uni
versities and colleges with an
NROTC unit will give naval officer
candidates an education commensu
rate with that given at Annapolis.

Final arrangements for the new
NROTC unit were completed this
week when six officers from the
Bureau of Naval Personnel in
Washington, D.C., headed by Cap
tain Arthur S. Adams, USN
(ret.), arrived on the campus for
a two-day inspection tour Wed
nesday. Stanford is the twenty
first institution which the group
has visited in its current tour,
traveling in a special naval air
transport plane.
Carefully Chosen Men
For the duration of the war,
trainees in the NROTC program will
be carefully selected on an aptitude
basis from enlisted personnel on ac
tive duty at shore stations or with
the fleet. Approximately three
fourths of the men will be entering
the program as freshmen, the re
mainder having advanced training.
According to the present Navy cal
endar, the NROTC program is 11
quarters in length with a minimum
load of 17 units per quarter, requir
ing two and two-thirds years for
completion. It will be the equival

ent of a regular four-year college
course and will lead to a reserve
