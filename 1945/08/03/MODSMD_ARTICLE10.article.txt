## BACKGROUND OR BACKBONE? 
### 
According to an editorial in SC's "Daily Tro
jan" it is the people "who are looking for some
thing to hang their personalities on," "the back
ground seekers," who are the backbone of col
lege life and existence. We have no guarrel
with this statement. To a large extent it is true.
However we disagree with the conclusion which
is quite satisfied with the observation and SC's
'building substantial, well-educated, well
groomed men and women of which Troy will
be proud."
For too long too much attention has been paid
'o substantiality and grooming. For too long
"background" has meant a little poly sci, a little
physics, a little civ, and a little language. This
is nothing to be proud of. The men and women
which America needs if it intends to remain
tree must be more than substantial and well
groomed, more than being able to "appreciate
the music of Bach as well as that of Benny."
Freedom does not primarily mean privileges, it
means responsibility—the kind of responsibility
exercised by thinking citizens. Well groomed
men with proper backgrounds have never been
able to preserve peace.
We do not advocate doing away with Bach
and Benny. But we do advocate education that
will go beyond that to make us think, educa
tion that will keep future generations out of
foxholes and out of concentration camps, edu
cation that will finally enable a generation to
say: "Our parents have not failed."
