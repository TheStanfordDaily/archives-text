No, the number of walk-outs on Cellar checks
has not improved. In fact, for the week of July

pocketed or left in booths for the bus boys to
"ind.
From our point of view it isn't the money that
is most important—but the use of a part of that
money.
If you have been at Stanford any length of
time you remember that the Associated Stu
dents built the Memorial Theatre; the aim of
the student body is to make a payment of
510,000 every six months toward the $160,-
302.69 balance.
In meeting these payments there are a few
sources of income upon which the Associated
Students heavily depend. One of these sources
is a part (50 cents) of a student's Community
Fee which is paid on Reg day of each quarter.
Another source of money for the Theatre Fund
s a percentage of the profit on Cellar checks.
Without regular contributions to the Me
morial Theatre Fund, no substantial amount
jan be erased from the balance of payments as
it was when the Associated Students gave the
Pavilion to the University. Consequently, the
entire plan of student-built buildings for the erf
loyment of all will receive a stick in its spokes.
As you step up to the cashier's cage in the
Jellar think that the profit on the check—
whether for 16 cents or $I.l6—means a one
step advance toward clearing the debt on Me
morial Theatre and setting a frame for a new
-ampus edifice. Maybe even a new Union.
