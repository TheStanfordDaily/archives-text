# The 						Case of the Straying Cokes
## 
### 
Since the beginning of Fall guarter, patrons of
the coke machines outside of the Nitery have
been careless about returning empties to the
racks provided. This carelessness has reached
a total of 1,000 missing bottles.
Both of these coke machines are rented by
the Associated Students and any loss on bot
tle deposits must be defrayed by themâ€”or
rather by us.
If campus coke-totalers wish to depend on the
the machines in the Union for the "pause that
refreshes" at times when ihe Cellar itself is not
open, their "refreshment" will depend on their
cooperation.
