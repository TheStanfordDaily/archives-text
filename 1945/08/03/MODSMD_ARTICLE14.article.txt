# Bull Session
## 
### DICK BOWER 
About this time every summer I get that "trapped"
feeling. Trapped in a lot of unbelievably dull courses
(Competitive Checkers 23) in which the professors have
been using the same jokes since the beginning of
time. Trapped in the Reserve Book Room with
Milton s 'Paradise Lost and the Chronicle Sporting
Green. Trapped in a book-world of uninteresting facts
about a lot of uninteresting people.
It must be the little things that make for my dis
content. Lipstick on the Cellar coffee cups. The pen
that leaks when you're taking notes. The moth hole in
your best sweater. That last letter from a service man
you ve never gotten around to answering. Those an
noying radio commercials. Cigarette ashes in my
coffee. All these little foolish things by the size of
which we live and die.

Another wistful note is injected into today's Bull
Session as we note the approaching demise of the San
Francisco cable cars. It will be a new "San Francisco"
when no longer we are able to help turn the cars
around at the Powell and Market turntable and clamber
aboard for a dizzy trip up Powell Street. When no
longer we can wave at passing motorists and talk with
the gripman. But the things I'll miss most are the
clanging bells and that precarious turn at Powell and
Jackson Streets.
