### CYCLONE COVEY 
THE ALBENERI TRIO opened its series of four
Stanford concerts Tuesday evening in Memorial Hall.
The Jrio consists of Alexander Schneider, violinist,
Benar Heifetz, cellist, Erich Itor Kahn, pianist, and
Margaret Barnett, page-turner.
The first selection was Haydn's Trio in E Flat Major,
which Haydn wrote about the time of the Surprise
Symphony- In this trio, Haydn, who thought pre
eminently in terms of the string quartet, did not seem
quite to grasp the adjustment requisites of the piano
ti io instrumentation. The louder and more percussive
tone of the modern piano would not account for the
maladjustment, because, in the first place, Mr. Kahn
plays remarkably non-percussively, and in the second,
you will hear tonight in the Mozart trio, which was
wi itten earlier than the Haydn, that the modern piano
has no disruptive influence on the instrumental blend.
The second selection was Ravel's Trio in A Minor.
It dates from the second year of the First World War
when Ravel served at the front in an ambulance corps.
In compositional chronology, it was written four years
later than his second Daphnis et Chloe Suite. It is the
only piano trio he wrote, and so far as I know, is the
most terrific trio in the literature.
The 1 eason is that Ravel reached for technical means
and artistic effects which nearly supersede the ca
pacities of three musicians and three instruments. It
is cast in sensuous French impressionism and utilizes,
among other devices, passages in harmonics, archaic
harmonies, and uneven rhythms. All these make beau
tiful designs in the score, which Dr. Allen himself
confessed difficulty in following.
concluding selection was Beethoven's Trio in
O Major, Op. 70, No. 1, which was written shortly after
the Pastoral Symphony and shortly before the Emperor
Concerto. It is dramatic enough to be considered a
symphony for three instruments; as Haydn took his
orientation from the string quartet, so Beethoven evi
dently was usually thinking orchestrally.
The musicians themselves are past masters. Nothing
needs to be said of their quality of performance.

Pei haps you are not interested in tlie chronological
relationship of these trios to better-known works of
the composers. But if you are, and since there are no
program notes supplied, the Mozart Trio in E Major
on tonight's program was written in the same year as
the E Flat, (i Minor, and Jupiter Symphonies; the
F <iure Trio in D Minor was written hardly more than
a year before Faure's death in 1924 (Faure was a
teacher of Ravel): and the Schubert Trio in li Flat
Major, the first of Schubert's four piano trios, was
written four years later than the Unfinished Symphony.
