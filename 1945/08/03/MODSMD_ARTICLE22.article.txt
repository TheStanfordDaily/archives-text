# Buck Talks On England
## 
### TED DRENTON 
England will not become a
radically socialist state as a re
sult of the swing to the left in the
recent parliamentary election, be
lieves Dr. Phillip W. Buck of the
Political Science department.
He compares the program of the
British labor party to the New Deal
program of our country, where much
legislation relating to public wel
fare was introduced. In Europe sim
ilar progressive social legislation has
been introduced steadily during the
last decade, and the labor party in
England will go just a little further
'in the same direction.
The British people are hard
headed, says Dr. Buck, and will
go slightly socialist. They will
never adopt the doctrines of so
cialism. though many of the lead
ers wish to say that they are prac
ticing that political philosophy.
It will be not in the least difficult
for our government to reconcile its
views with that type of community,
Dr. Buck believes. In the election
the people voted for a domestic policy
rather than a foreign policy. Dur
ing the campaign labor proposed to
continue war economic and social
control during peacetime as long as
should be necessary for the public
welfare. They promised to restore
free competitive activity cautiously
rather than immediately as the con
servative party proposed. In addi
tion the Laborites advocated nation
alization of important industries
such as the transportation and coal
and steel industries.
The conservatives suffered a
tactical disadvantage, in the opin
ion of Dr. Buck, for a great many
Britishers felt that these conserva
tives had played things a little
below the belt. Former Prime
Minister Churchill called the elec
tion a little sooner than the Labor
ites wished, then accused them of
calling the election too soon.
Many Laborites feel that the war
with Japan will be very near a con
clusion by November or December,
and the people, therefore, would not
be distracted by that issue. When
the election was called, many labor
ministers withdrew from the war
coalition Cabinet. Churchill then
during the campaign reproached
them for engaging in party politics.
Also an important factor was
the relative absence of a Conserva
tive program during the campaign,
believes Dr. Buck. The public was

not afraid of (he socialist gestapo
which Prime Minister Churchill
declared would arise from their
victory. The British were con
vinced that the war economic and
social controls were beneficial and
not dangerous.
British foreign policy will not
change, Dr. Buck states. The social
ists have always advocated inter
national cooperation and an interna
tional organization. In no way does
this policy differ from the policy of
the conservative government. It is
possible, he believes, that the social
ists may more aggressively support
an international organization.
He predicts that during the next
decade socialist states and leaders
will cooperate with each other.
A considerable time must elapse
before conflict between socialist
communities will develop, he be
lieves.
A substantial majority of the popu
lar vote favored the Labor party in
the election, he declares, but the vote
was not as disproportionate as the
shift of Labor representatives in
Parliament would indicate .The sit
uation in England was similar to the
election of 1932 in the United States
when the democratic party was
elected by a relatively small popular
majority but gained overwhelming
representation in Congress.
The Labor party gained .190
seats in this election which gives
them a workable majority to carry
out their program. During the
last decade the Laborites have
been slowly winning an increased
popular voteâ€”until their complete
victory last week.
