# Police Ask Co-operation To End Bike-Borrowing
## 
### 
Ninety per cent of Stanford students don't think of the other fellow
when they hop on the nearest bike to make an eight o'clock or to meet a
friend in the Cellar. Such thoughtless borrowing keeps the under-staffed
force of campus patrolmen on 24-hour lookout for the missing bicycles.
"Over (i()0 bicldes reported 'borrowed' between 1!)42-1!)45 have been re-

covered by our department," said <
Stanford Chief of Police Gordy Dav
is in a Daily interview yesterday.
"And this figure," Mr. Davis con
tinued, "docs not includc the in
numerable bicycles which were
found around the campus by their
owners."
As many as five complaints from
students whose bicycles were taken
either from in front of their living
group or, on the Quad have been
received in one day by the Stan
ford police department. The bike
borrowers often use a handy bicycle
just for a quick ride to their own
campus residence or to a point on
the Quad where they abandon it
for police to pick up at a time when
patrolmen are available. Sometimes
the borrowed bicycles are ridden
to Palo Alto and left near off
campus residences: in one instance,
a bike was abandoned at the corner
of University Avenue and the Bay
shore Highway.
"There is no problem, however,
of students borrowing bicycles in
Palo Alto for use on tlie campus,"
Mr. Davis explained. "The prob
lem is a very local one."
As no man is available to police
the entire area of bicycle traffic, and
as it would be impossible to check
on all riders individually, the campus
police ask the cooperation of the
student body to keep in mind the
welfare of everybodyâ€”not only in
not borrowing another's property but
also in riding and parking their
own bikes.
"Of late," Mr. Davis points out,"
the entrances to the Cellar and the
basement of the History building
have been badly congested with bi
cycles which riders could leave in
or near the racks provided."
On the brighter side, the police
department is pleased with the co
operation which it has received
from students and faculty who re
frain from riding on the Inner
Quad and under the arcades. Only
a small percentage of cyclists dis
regard this ruling which was as a
public safety measure about two
years ago when bicycles first be
came common on the Farm.
"In these two or more years the
bicycle has become as important to
its owner as his car once was. The
owner depends on them not only as
a means of transportation but also
for reaching his next class on time.
The standards of decency should be
all required for students to respect
the owner's property."
Here Mr. Davis reminded bi
cyclists that licenses are required
if the bicycle is ridden into Palo
Alto, but not if it is used only on
the campus. The department is
considering at present that it may
be advantageous to have Stan
ford license plates as an easier

means of identifying and record
ing bicycles. In view of the num
ber of unclaimed and unlicensed
bikes a system of local licenses
would also make the owners easier
to locate.
This plea for cooperation comes
from Mr. Davis, who has been at
Stanford for 16 years; from the four
patrol officers who among their oth
er duties keep a constant lookout for
the 18-20 bikes on the current miss
ing list; and from the two plain
clothesmen on the force.
