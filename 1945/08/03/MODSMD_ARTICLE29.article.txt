Jumping rapidly into the sports
parade on the Pacific Coast is surf
board riding, a direct import from
Hawaii.
Long claiming the most ideal surf
ing conditions, Wakiki's boast is
being shattered by San Onofre, a
small town about forty-five miles
north of San Diego. The water at
San Onofre is not too choppy—or
100 cold—in the winter; the beach
:s not rocky; and the place is close
enough to nowhere so as never to
be too crowded with swimmers.
Make Their Own Boards
Most surfers make their own
boards, a task that takes about five
months. Boards are hollow; about
two feet wide, ten feet in length, and
weigh around one hundred pounds.
The trick in building a board is
to have the two sides correctly
matched so that it will balance when
the two pieces are fitted together.
To ride all the way to the shore
is the hope of every surfster, a feat
not so easy to do considering that
you are standing up on a roughly
moving slab of wood going about
fifteen miles an hour.
The game is not without its
dangers. When a spill is taken, the
board kicks back, and a mighty
kerplunk on the noggin is all too
often the result.
Used in Life Saving
Surf boarding is used in latest
ocean water life guard technique.
The drowning persin is reached
quicker via surf board, and it also
offers a place to put the person
until the regular row boat gets out.
It is the hope of surf enthusiasts
that after the war an annual meet

can be held at San Onofre for all
coast surfsters.
Several of the outstanding south
ern surfers are now at Stanford.
Dorian Paskowitz of the Med School
in San Francisco and Bob Thaxton,
a legal lad, are highly regarded in
surfdom ranks. . . . Watch the boys
surf sometime. It's great sport.
Strictly vhe Lowdown
Also watch for John the Good in
his next outing at the Del Mar
pony palace. The nag is a natural
on the mount, the horse can't fail
to win—or for sure, show—and if
nothing else, place.
Another "goodie" is Sammy An
gott. The odds might not be ter
rific, but betting on Sanuny is like
putting money in the bank.
