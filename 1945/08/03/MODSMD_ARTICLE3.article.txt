# Lagunita, Roble to Furnish Music, Moon, Romance at Summer Formal
## 
### 
Tomorrow's the night! "
What light?
Saturday night.
Jusi any Saturday night?
No, the night of Hua Hao Yueh j
Yuan. The night of dreamy music, '
of the delicate scent of blossoms !
wafting over the evening breezes. I
and of a sympathetic moon beam
ing over happy couples.
In short, Hua Hao Yueh Yuan
means a night of romance for the
Lagunita-Roble summer formal.
For the girls who haven't already
made their arrangements, there are
many men in Encina who are also

waiting for blind dates to the formal.
The social chairman of Eoble and
Lagunita will help any girl make
connections with Encina, who has
all kinds of men to suit all tastes
—young or old, tall or short, and
they're all in uniform too.
ASSU Sells Bids
. The tickets are on sale in the
ASSU office at $2.50 apiece. The
night of the dance they may be
purchased at Lagunita desk. The
bids picture a romantic couple on a
pagoda looking at the moon—a very
popular occupation in the U. S. as
well as China.
The Chinese theme was originated
by Dorothy McGuire, a freshman,
who won the prize of a free bid,
offered by Lagunita and Roble for
an idea. The name, Hua Hao Yueh
Yuan, was contributed by the
Chinese students and they say that
it means something so good it can't
even be literally translated.
Chinese Students Help
The Chinese students, under the
leadership of Dorothy Chin, are also
helping with the decorations to as
sure accuracy in all ways.
The not-so-Chinese-but-good-any
way music will be furnished by Bert
Whiting, his 10 piece orchestra, and
vocalist, Sonia Shaw. Whiting was
well received last quarter when he
played at the Lagunita-Union
Spring Fantasy and other dances.
There will be dancing outside in
the court, as well as in the gym
itself.
Flour Show
During the intermission ihere will
be an informal floor show featuring
Chinese dancers from campus.
"Ii you're complaining." said Ruth
Altucker, dance chairman, "about
the lack of activity on campus this
