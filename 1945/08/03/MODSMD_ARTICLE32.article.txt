# Monroe Wins First Half
## 
### ART BOB 
Attention all major league scouts:
a pitcher has been discovered. The
Hall of Fame has been crashed by
one A. Barney Gugel who pitched
a no-hitter against the Toyon
Toughies. Baffling the opposition
with his "psychology" ball, Barney
was in complete control throughout
the fracas.
The Old One was a little shaky
in his mound debut, but with a
game under his belt now, he ought
to have no trouble anymore.
The Boozers, on the other hand,
slapped the pellet to all corners of
the field. In fact everyone hit the
ball, except Gugel, who, living up
to the reputation of a pitcher, struck
out twice.
In an exclusive Daily interview
after the game, Gugel let it be
known that he got all his baseball
strength from taking shower baths
at the E. Rossotti Finnish Baths.
In the other games that were
played, Tyler downed Arthur in a
close tilt by a score of 8-6. Tyler
bunched 3 hits for 5 runs in the
third inning to take the lead 5-2;
lost ii again in the fifth when Arthur
tied up the ball game. Tyler again
took the lead when they pushed
over their final three runs in the
sixth and held on to their advantage
to win. The game was close and
Tyler was helped by getting the
edge on several close plays.
The Medics pulled the biggst up
set of the season when they toppled
hte C.A.T.S. in a close 3-2 contest.
The C.A.T.S. who were riding on
their laurels could not push a run
across in the late innings after they
had given the Medics a lead early
in the game.
Yesterday's games showed Monroe
holding their league lead when they
edged out Tyler in a game punctu
ated with errors on both teams. Bob
Rosburg pitched 4 hit ball to effec
tively blank the "Hilltoppers," but
his team support was atrocious and
most of the runs were unearned.
Tyler made a desperate attempt to
win the ball game in the last in
ning but ended up on the short end
of a 8-6 score.
Final standings in Round I are as
follows:
W L T
Monroe 5 1 9
C.A.T.S 4 1 1
Toyon II 3 2 0
Tyler 3 3 0
Arthur 1 4 0
Toyon I 0 6 0
