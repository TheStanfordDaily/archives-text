# Former 'Farm' Hurdler Awarded Bronze Stars
## 
### BOB SLOBE 
News oi Lt. (j.g.) Ed Hertel, top
Stanford hurdler on the 1942 team
has been sent to us by Garnett
Young, in the form of a letter writ
ten to him by Hertel who is now
aboard the U.S.S. Claxton, a de
stroyer. Ed has seen plenty of ac
tion, a fact readily attested to by
the Philippine Liberation Ribbon
and the two bronze stars he wears.
He was under direct attack by the
enemy on six occasions, for which
he received the first bronze star, and
participated in eight initial landings,
which, to mention a few, included
Lingeyen Gulf, Bataan, Corregidor,
and two different landings on Min
danao.
Top Man in '42
Hertel was practically the whole
Indian track team in 1942, and was
a consistent point getter in all the
meets. Stanford had a mediocre
team that year, and depended heav
ily on Hertel (note the similarity
to hurdle) to take firsts in both the
low and high hurdles. His success
can be fairly accurately traced by
the comments of track coach,
"Pitch" Johnson on the achieve
ments of Hertel. During the early
part of the '42 season, Johnson stat
ed that Ed had good form but he
lacked speed, for he was unable to
do the 100 in better than 10.6, where
as a good hurdler should run the
dash in about 10.2.
Comes Close to Record
As the season progressed, how

ever, Johnson acclaimed Hertel as
one of the best hurdlers he had ever
had al Stanford, and Ed went on to
take wins in aIJ the big meets ex
cept one in which he was bothered
by a groin injury. He came close to
breaking Cal's Tom Moore's record
of 14.2 for the 120 high hurdles when
he took first in the Big Three Meet
in the fast time of 14.3. That was the
day that Hal "Hurry" Davis tied the
world's record for the 100 in the time
of 9.4.
Ed added a complimentary note t(
the people of Palo Alto and Uncle
Jim Reynolds when he wrote:
"Once again I want to thank all
of the good people of Palo Alto
for their wonderful support of the
7th War Loan. Each time they
seem to surpass their preceding
record. (TVG, which in Navy
language means "well done").
"I have received two of Unclc
Jim Reynolds' swell NEWS FROM
HOME letters; if I ever get on the
beach again I hope to look up
some of the Stanford men out
here who were mentioned in the
newsy letter. And as soon as 1
return to normal life (some sleep)
I am going to thank Mr. Reynolds
for the good work lie is doing."
Ed also expressed a desire to get
out and run those hurdles again.
May we wish Ed Hertel good luck
with the hope that he will again see
those Stanford teams which he was
once an integral part.

part of the '42 season, Johnson stat
ed that Ed had good form but he
lacked speed, for he was unable to
do the 100 in better than 10.6, where
as a good hurdler should run the
dash in about 10.2.
Comes Close to Record
As the season progressed, how

ever, Johnson acclaimed Hertel as
one of the best hurdlers he had ever
had al Stanford, and Ed went on to
take wins in aIJ the big meets ex
cept one in which he was bothered
by a groin injury. He came close to
breaking Cal's Tom Moore's record
of 14.2 for the 120 high hurdles when
he took first in the Big Three Meet
in the fast time of 14.3. That was the
day that Hal "Hurry" Davis tied the
world's record for the 100 in the time
of 9.4.
Ed added a complimentary note t(
the people of Palo Alto and Uncle
Jim Reynolds when he wrote:
"Once again I want to thank all
of the good people of Palo Alto
for their wonderful support of the
7th War Loan. Each time they
seem to surpass their preceding
record. (TVG, which in Navy
language means "well done").
"I have received two of Unclc
Jim Reynolds' swell NEWS FROM
HOME letters; if I ever get on the
beach again I hope to look up
some of the Stanford men out
here who were mentioned in the
newsy letter. And as soon as 1
return to normal life (some sleep)
I am going to thank Mr. Reynolds
for the good work lie is doing."
Ed also expressed a desire to get
out and run those hurdles again.
May we wish Ed Hertel good luck
with the hope that he will again see
those Stanford teams which he was
once an integral part.
News oi Lt. (j.g.) Ed Hertel, top
Stanford hurdler on the 1942 team
has been sent to us by Garnett
Young, in the form of a letter writ
ten to him by Hertel who is now
aboard the U.S.S. Claxton, a de
stroyer. Ed has seen plenty of ac
tion, a fact readily attested to by
the Philippine Liberation Ribbon
and the two bronze stars he wears.
He was under direct attack by the
enemy on six occasions, for which
he received the first bronze star, and
participated in eight initial landings,
which, to mention a few, included
Lingeyen Gulf, Bataan, Corregidor,
and two different landings on Min
danao.
Top Man in '42
Hertel was practically the whole
Indian track team in 1942, and was
a consistent point getter in all the
meets. Stanford had a mediocre
team that year, and depended heav
ily on Hertel (note the similarity
to hurdle) to take firsts in both the
low and high hurdles. His success
can be fairly accurately traced by
the comments of track coach,
"Pitch" Johnson on the achieve
ments of Hertel. During the early
part of the '42 season, Johnson stat
ed that Ed had good form but he
lacked speed, for he was unable to
do the 100 in better than 10.6, where
