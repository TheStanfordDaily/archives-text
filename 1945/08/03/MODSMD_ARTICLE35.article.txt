# The 						Great Day
## 
### 
Up and down the corridors of
Encina Hall it spread, slowly at first,
then with greater momentum. From
room to room, from section to sec
tion. from floor to floor the news
traveled.
No, it couldn't be true! But it
was!
Enlisted men shed their customary
apathy, a new light gleamed in
their eyes. As the time drew nearer
they grew increasingly restless;
finally, at the sight of the captain
wearing an automatic on his hip they
knew the time had come. It was
pay day!
All during this time the E.R.C.'s
iad been gathering into sullen
knots. At the mere sight of a piece
of blue braid their low grumbling
would assume a new, threatening
tone. Finally when money started
changing hands, they could stand it
no more. All except a few hardened
oldtimers left to brood in silent jeal
ousy.
As the pay line progressed a hund
red eyes were on one man. Was it
the captain handing out the money?
Was it the lieutenant calling out
the names? No! It was the tri
owner of the Shaft, and the eyes
were the eyes of his creditors. He
never had a chance â€”the only en
listed man in Encina hall to be dead
broke on pay day.
