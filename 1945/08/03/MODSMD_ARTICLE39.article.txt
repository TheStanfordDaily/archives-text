Apparently a pent-up fury was released
upon the AST softball activity Wednesday
evening. When the smoke cleared three un
defeated teams had bitten the dust, one pitcher
had hurled a nearly perfect no-hit, no-run
game, and two outfits, broke loose to cash in
on their first taste of victory.
Big excitement was in evidence in the Co. C
league as the haughty and undefeated ME-6's
took the field to battle their challengers, the
CE-5 (Coots). The ME-10 even demanded the
use of the best diamond to aid in sewing up
the championship. Nevertheless by the time
seven innings of play had been completed, the
CE-s's had licked them, 6-4, and thus moved
into a tie for first place.
In the other Co. C game, Pitcher Twomley
paced the E-l, T-3, (2b & 4) team in a 16-0
win over the hapless CE-5 (Tigers?) by pitch
ing a no-hit, no-run game. Only two rival
batters reached base—via the walk route—and
only one of them saw second. While his team
mates played flawless ball, Twomley further
aided his superb efforts by striking out twelve
of the 23 men to face him. Safford and Polan
each slammed out a homer for the winners.
Two close contests with identical scores
were played in the Co. A loop. CE-4 squeezed
out a 5-4 victory over the E-l, T-3's and thus
took undisputed possession of second place.
The leading EE-6's recovered from their last
week's jolt to sneak away with an extra inning
5-4 verdict over the cellar dwelling ME-4's.
Two of the EE's runs were the result of a
costly error by the ME-4 centerfielder.
ERC league games found the two undefeated
aggregations, 4a & 4b and 2b & sb, failing to
protect their unblemished records as they too
were forced to swallow defeat for the first
time. The sb-2 & 5c outfit, who up to this time
had not won a game, took the measure of 5b

& 2b by nipping them in a 9-8 contest. The
4a'& 4b's were administered their medicine by
the mediocre 3a & 3b ten. Cooper's homer with
three on proved a deciding factor in this tilt
as the final margin was 8-5.
Another team who had possessed a no-win
record was lc & 2a. They found themselves
enough, however, to pound out a 13-11 de
cision over 2c & sa. Hayes did a respectable
job of pitching by wiffing nine. The other ERC
fray was between la & lb and 3c & 4c with
the former winding up on the long end of a
7-6 count.
In AST intramural tournaments, practically
all of the first round and many second round
pairings have been played off in tennis, ping
pong, and horseshoe. The next swimming ac
tivity will occur this Saturday as Co. C holds
their pre-finals eliminations.

Apparently a pent-up fury was released
upon the AST softball activity Wednesday
evening. When the smoke cleared three un
defeated teams had bitten the dust, one pitcher
had hurled a nearly perfect no-hit, no-run
game, and two outfits, broke loose to cash in
on their first taste of victory.
Big excitement was in evidence in the Co. C
league as the haughty and undefeated ME-6's
took the field to battle their challengers, the
CE-5 (Coots). The ME-10 even demanded the
use of the best diamond to aid in sewing up
the championship. Nevertheless by the time
seven innings of play had been completed, the
CE-s's had licked them, 6-4, and thus moved
into a tie for first place.
In the other Co. C game, Pitcher Twomley
paced the E-l, T-3, (2b & 4) team in a 16-0
win over the hapless CE-5 (Tigers?) by pitch
ing a no-hit, no-run game. Only two rival
batters reached base—via the walk route—and
only one of them saw second. While his team
mates played flawless ball, Twomley further
aided his superb efforts by striking out twelve
of the 23 men to face him. Safford and Polan
each slammed out a homer for the winners.
Two close contests with identical scores
were played in the Co. A loop. CE-4 squeezed
out a 5-4 victory over the E-l, T-3's and thus
took undisputed possession of second place.
The leading EE-6's recovered from their last
week's jolt to sneak away with an extra inning
5-4 verdict over the cellar dwelling ME-4's.
Two of the EE's runs were the result of a
costly error by the ME-4 centerfielder.
ERC league games found the two undefeated
aggregations, 4a & 4b and 2b & sb, failing to
protect their unblemished records as they too
were forced to swallow defeat for the first
time. The sb-2 & 5c outfit, who up to this time
had not won a game, took the measure of 5b

& 2b by nipping them in a 9-8 contest. The
4a'& 4b's were administered their medicine by
the mediocre 3a & 3b ten. Cooper's homer with
three on proved a deciding factor in this tilt
as the final margin was 8-5.
Another team who had possessed a no-win
record was lc & 2a. They found themselves
enough, however, to pound out a 13-11 de
cision over 2c & sa. Hayes did a respectable
job of pitching by wiffing nine. The other ERC
fray was between la & lb and 3c & 4c with
the former winding up on the long end of a
7-6 count.
In AST intramural tournaments, practically
all of the first round and many second round
pairings have been played off in tennis, ping
pong, and horseshoe. The next swimming ac
tivity will occur this Saturday as Co. C holds
their pre-finals eliminations.
