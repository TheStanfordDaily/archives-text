So you want to know how you
stand? Well, Army students as a
group, cannot be taken into consid
eration. for no matter what the uni
form, a girl looks for the same in
! any man she meets. The girls con-
I sider the soldiers a swell bunch of
j fellows or a bunch of rats, depend
ing on the actions of those they have
! chanced to meet.
The girls who go to the Army
dances stag go with the idea in
J mind of having a good time and
meeting a lot of people, and they do.
| Those who date a student do so of
j their own free will, and should
j know whether they will enjoy
[ themselves or not. To tell the truth,
we try to consider the Gl's as real
; Stanford Roughs, and hope they will
consider themselves as such and act
| accordingly.â€”Jackie Miller, Roble.
Ed. Note: The reference regarding
| "Stanford 'Roughs' . . . act aceora
! ingly" is quite a challenge.
