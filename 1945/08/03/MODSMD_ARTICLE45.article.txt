Wo of the younger generation who
j diligently mop and dust while our
| bearded (5 o'clock shadow) and ven
-1 erable roommates snooze, have only

j one complaint to make. Although
we are too young to endure the
hardships of army life, shouldn't we
be allowed to enjoy some of its bless
j ings? Why is it that only the "vet
| erans of basic" enjoy the caresses
i of the Stanford women? The "Gold
brick Boys" have their Meemi, Bo
gart has Bacall, but what do we
have besides our fond memories of
the girls we 'eft behind?
What we have in mind are 153
beautiful women—they must be
blond <?s, brunettes, or redheads.
None can be over 94 inches in height
and none under 46 inches. They
should be between the ages of sev
enteen and seventy, preferably un
married and innocent. Applicants
who meet the above requirements
may apply at Rm. 109 in Encina. If
Feinberg is asleep, please do not
awaken him; if Feinberg is not
asleep, it is not Km. 109.
