# Author Revises 'Family' Script
## 
### 
Rehearsals of Pearl Buck's "My
Indian Family," which has its world
premiere here August 16, 17 and 18,
prove the old theater adage that
"plays are not written, they are re
written."
Working with a new script, the
problems of adjusting. the lines to
the action are being met. It was
originally intended to have Miss
Buck come to the campus, but trans
portation difficulties made this im
cossible. The next best thing is b
ing done. Almost every night after
the rehearsal Miss McMahon. who
has one of the leading roles, phones
Miss Buck at her home in Pennsyl
vania, tells her the problems that
have arisen, and gets her help in
solving them.
Only yesterday Miss Buck sent an
entirely new draft of one scene.
Miss McMahon and Mr. Strickland,
director of the play, have decided,
however, that the version already
in rehearsal is better. Only a few
lines from the new script will be
borrowed for the earlier version.
"There is a special problem with
this play." Mr. Strickland explained.
"It is a dramatization from a novel
full ot episodes. Almost all of them
are colorful and dramatic. What the
author of the play had to do was
to select from a wealth of material.
And Miss Buck has been so generous
in her writing that we too have had
to select. We suffer from too much
good material.
Mr. Strickland concluded that no
more changes will be made. Miss
McMahon and he have decided that
the script now in rehearsal will be
played. He stated that after the
tryout other revision can be made
if they seem advisable.
