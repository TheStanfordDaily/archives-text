# Claude Angles Describes French Underground
## 
### 
Claude Angles, former member of the French underground, talked on
the activities of this organization during the German occupation, yester
day at 4:30 in the Women's Clubhouse.
Miss Angles, who was accompanied from San Francisco by Mr. Jaques
Baeyens, Consul General of France, is one of six former underground

workers who have been sent to the
United States by the Information
Service of the French government.
A medical student in Paris at the
time of the fall of France, Miss
Angles became associated in July
of IT4I with the clandestine news
paper, "Defense de la France," and
from that Lime until the liberation
of France she worked with the un
derground.
Uniformed
Wearing the uniform of the
French Wac and the high hair-do
now popular in France, Miss Angles
spoke of the feeling of shame which
overcame the French people when
they realized that their government
had succumbed to the Germans after
so little struggle. It was this feeling
of shame, she explained, which
coupled with the resentment felt
later when the conquerors confi
scated most of the food and shelter
led the French to organize the bands
of resistance which later developed
into the widespread system of the
French underground.
They Resist
"We knew that it was out duty
to resist, although under the close
surveillance of the Germans it was
of course very difficult to do," said
Miss Angles, in speaking of the
spirit which united the workers in
the resistance movement.
"It was a great satisfaction to
the underground workers to know
that even though the Gestapo caught
some of us, there would be" others
who would carry on the work," she
continued.
While assisting in the distribution
of the underground newspaper, "De
fense de la France," Miss Angles
carried copies of the forbidden paper
in X-ray film cartoons obstensibly
used in her work at the hospital.
Tells Exploits
Speaking in a very un-assuming
manner. Miss Angles told several
stories of the exploits of her friends
but said little of her own work
with the French Military intel
ligence. She worked with this bu
reau in an editorial capacity and
also supplied information on Ger
man military movements, convoys,
and depots. As a social worker
among the families of political pris
oners, she had many contacts with
espionage agents arriving from Lon
don to organize sabotage elements.

that even though the Gestapo caught
some of us, there would be" others
who would carry on the work," she
continued.
While assisting in the distribution
of the underground newspaper, "De
fense de la France," Miss Angles
carried copies of the forbidden paper
in X-ray film cartoons obstensibly
used in her work at the hospital.
Tells Exploits
Speaking in a very un-assuming
manner. Miss Angles told several
stories of the exploits of her friends
but said little of her own work
with the French Military intel
ligence. She worked with this bu
reau in an editorial capacity and
also supplied information on Ger
man military movements, convoys,
and depots. As a social worker
among the families of political pris
oners, she had many contacts with
espionage agents arriving from Lon
don to organize sabotage elements.
Claude Angles, former member of the French underground, talked on
the activities of this organization during the German occupation, yester
day at 4:30 in the Women's Clubhouse.
Miss Angles, who was accompanied from San Francisco by Mr. Jaques
Baeyens, Consul General of France, is one of six former underground

workers who have been sent to the
United States by the Information
Service of the French government.
A medical student in Paris at the
time of the fall of France, Miss
Angles became associated in July
of IT4I with the clandestine news
paper, "Defense de la France," and
from that Lime until the liberation
of France she worked with the un
derground.
Uniformed
Wearing the uniform of the
French Wac and the high hair-do
now popular in France, Miss Angles
spoke of the feeling of shame which
overcame the French people when
they realized that their government
had succumbed to the Germans after
so little struggle. It was this feeling
of shame, she explained, which
coupled with the resentment felt
later when the conquerors confi
scated most of the food and shelter
led the French to organize the bands
of resistance which later developed
into the widespread system of the
French underground.
They Resist
"We knew that it was out duty
to resist, although under the close
surveillance of the Germans it was
of course very difficult to do," said
Miss Angles, in speaking of the
spirit which united the workers in
the resistance movement.
"It was a great satisfaction to
the underground workers to know
that even though the Gestapo caught
some of us, there would be" others
who would carry on the work," she
continued.
