# Epsteen Analyzes Atomic Weapon
## 
### 
What about the atomic bomb?
Considering that only one was
used it is possible that the things
are difficult to mass-produce, and
this might mean that their use will
be limited to the air war. However,
this one raid might just be a fright
ener, to draw reaction from Tokyo.
Also, considering that its produc
tion was based on the scientific
studies of many men throughout the
world and that military collapse
beat Germany to its discovery by
only twenty-three weeks, it might
not remain a secret very long. In
fact, the Japs may be about to pro
duce something like it.
It Japan can hold up under atomic
bomb poundings, and make a similar
bomb for herself, our invasion might
be much more difficult, but the odds
are that this new weapon might just
win the war through air power, un
less the enemy can use it against
our air bases.
We don't know exactly what the
future holds, but we must realize
that civilization has found some
thing new. We can only say that it's
gigantic in possibility.
