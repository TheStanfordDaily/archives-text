Just a Coincidence?
From the Daily Trojan (Southern California),
fuly 26. 1945:
" 'Meet me in the Cellar' will be a familiar
ohrase on the campus starting today. At 10 a.m.
the doors of the large basement beneath the
Student Union building will be thrown open
for all students. In the Cellar will be sold hot
and cold drinks, salads and sandwiches." .

From the Stanford students daily for the past
15 odd years:
"Seeya in the Cellar; I'll cut my 10-o'clock
and save us a booth."

Wonder if in following the Farm S.C. will job
our beloved landmarks, "This Section Closed"
and "Bus your own dishes—except during lunch
and dinner."
