HAVE YA HEARD
A Cellar Dweller has been spreading the tale that
there is a 4:17 p.m. lull in the lineup at the "This
Section Closed" sjgn. Only it' you finish the ob
stacle courses from the Engineering corner past the
Bond Booth and the Cellar bulletin board) ex
actly on the stroke of 4:17 will you be able to order
a frost and still make it home to dinner. It says
here.
After a week's residence in the Union catecombs
investigating this latest Farm rumor, I can offer in
fallible proof that THERE IS NO CLOCK ON
CAMPUS WHICH STRIKES 4:17.
It is purely in the interests of keeping Stanford free
from other such morale-blasting stories that the Daily
wishes to expose current rumor-mongers. Their cen
tral offices are located in the Reserve Book Room—
you may have seen their "coat of arms .... "Or
any fraction of an hour thereof." But that's no rumor!
It was vee-e-ery clever of them to win our confidence
tvith a "nothing-truer" password.
No, there is little danger in the R.B.R. The real
threat lies in the many branch offices scattered about
the campus. From these offices, a deserter tells us,
rumors flow like the proverbial snow-ball which
gathers no moss. Need we say that the deserter was
a little shaken up by all that he had heard and
repeated.
We reprint here a few of the rumors from the
official R.B.R. (which does not stand for ragged but
right) news bureau. The dateline reads August 7.
1945. Don't say we didn't warn you.
1. Under housing problem file—The CATS really
do live in the Ed building.
2. Better Business Bureau—The lake is dry because
its clear-flowing waters have been canned to
store up a reserve supply of electricity to see
the light in the Hoover Tower through the long,
hard summer months.
3. May field theatre patrons—Roy Rogers is the
smartest horse in the movies.
4. Miscellaneous—A Lagunita girl knows how to
float cream in her coffee.
5. General panic—Cinch notices are out.
This is just a sample of the wild tales which we of
:he Stanford family must combat in the days to come.
I'd write more if I had the time but I'm due at the
Pari-Mutual window right now. Or haven't you heard
the stadium is open again, the boards down, the
streamers flying—oh, not officially of course but just
for the racing season.

rumors flow like the proverbial snow-ball which
gathers no moss. Need we say that the deserter was
a little shaken up by all that he had heard and
repeated.
We reprint here a few of the rumors from the
official R.B.R. (which does not stand for ragged but
right) news bureau. The dateline reads August 7.
1945. Don't say we didn't warn you.
1. Under housing problem file—The CATS really
do live in the Ed building.
2. Better Business Bureau—The lake is dry because
its clear-flowing waters have been canned to
store up a reserve supply of electricity to see
the light in the Hoover Tower through the long,
hard summer months.
3. May field theatre patrons—Roy Rogers is the
smartest horse in the movies.
4. Miscellaneous—A Lagunita girl knows how to
float cream in her coffee.
5. General panic—Cinch notices are out.
This is just a sample of the wild tales which we of
:he Stanford family must combat in the days to come.
I'd write more if I had the time but I'm due at the
Pari-Mutual window right now. Or haven't you heard
the stadium is open again, the boards down, the
streamers flying—oh, not officially of course but just
for the racing season.
HAVE YA HEARD
A Cellar Dweller has been spreading the tale that
there is a 4:17 p.m. lull in the lineup at the "This
Section Closed" sjgn. Only it' you finish the ob
stacle courses from the Engineering corner past the
Bond Booth and the Cellar bulletin board) ex
actly on the stroke of 4:17 will you be able to order
a frost and still make it home to dinner. It says
here.
After a week's residence in the Union catecombs
investigating this latest Farm rumor, I can offer in
fallible proof that THERE IS NO CLOCK ON
CAMPUS WHICH STRIKES 4:17.
It is purely in the interests of keeping Stanford free
from other such morale-blasting stories that the Daily
wishes to expose current rumor-mongers. Their cen
tral offices are located in the Reserve Book Room—
you may have seen their "coat of arms .... "Or
any fraction of an hour thereof." But that's no rumor!
It was vee-e-ery clever of them to win our confidence
tvith a "nothing-truer" password.
No, there is little danger in the R.B.R. The real
threat lies in the many branch offices scattered about
the campus. From these offices, a deserter tells us,
rumors flow like the proverbial snow-ball which
gathers no moss. Need we say that the deserter was
a little shaken up by all that he had heard and
repeated.
