### CYCLONE COVEY 
CONFLICT, now playing at the Stanford, chalks up
one more in the year's anomalous string of surprisingly
excellent mystery movies.

This one admixes the scent of Ex
tract of Freud with the squint of
Humphrey of Bogart.
''Funny things go on inside
people's heads," Bogart remarks
midways.
"A thought," Psychologist Sydney
Greenstreet had postulated earlier,
"can be like a malignant disease
which must be removed before it
becomes destructive."

THE AMAZON AWAKENS, a Walt Disney produc
tion which showed last week in the Latin American
Workshop series, demonstrated not only the fabulous
potential of the Amazon Valley and the unsuspected
extent of its present exploitation, its modern cities
and the jungle projects of Henry Ford, but more
forcibly the impact possible in Disney's cartoon-plus
photograph system of visual education and entertain
ment.
The Workshop color movies, which show Thursday at
8 in the Education Auditorium, you will often find
profitable and pretty, even when not by Disney.

THE ALBENERI TRIO arrived at its appelation, ac
cording to a cogitatious Stanford lad, by combining the
first letters of the first names of its personnel: Alex
ander, Benar, and Erich.
The Schubert Trio in B Flat on Friday's Program
completely overshadowed the other numbers by the
scale of its compositional conception. Tonight we hear
the Trio in E Flat, which Schubert wrote immediately
after the trio played Friday.
A bigger attraction, however, is the Archduke'
Beethoven's greatest piano trio, the majestic Andante
Cantabile movement of which you are probably al
ready familiar with even if you never have heard the
trio itself.

JAMES W. McBAIN, Stanford's globe-trotting chem
istry professor, said in his lecture Sunday afternoon
that the Russians played movements of symphonies
after banquets and between courses, assuming as a
matter of course that that is what everybody wants to
hear. And during the playing, he said, not a Russian
lifted his silverware or spoke a word of conversation.
There are many theaters—and filled—in Russia, Mc-
Bain said, wherein opera, concert, and ballet are cul
tivated as nearly perfectly as the performers can make
them. And even when the audience consists largely of
shirt-sleeved laborers, both audience and performers
are absorbed in the conscientious creation of beauty.
What a strange country, in which scholars are higher
regarded than businessmen, and a philharmonic is pre
ferred to a crooner.
We must all take a flyer to Russia one day. And
meantime let us see what can be done toward social
ized medicine.
