To the Editor:
The honor code is not just a classroom behavior for
taking exams. It does not start and stop with the sign
ing of your name on the blue-book. IT IS A STAND
ARD OF LIVING.
The students of Stanford University should feel some
prick of conscience when in one issue of the Daily
(Aug. 3) it mentions 1. That Cellar checks are not
being paid 2. That coke bottles are not being re
turned and 3. that dozens of bicycles are missing or
misplaced every day.
It is true that the small profits of the Cellar go to
pay off the Mem. Aud. fund. We are fortunate to have
cokes on the campus. There is a shortage thus summer
and gratitude could be expressed by at least returning
the bottles.
And bicycles are an expense—the person who grabs
up another person's bicycle apparently has no consider
ation for the possessions of others. He or she is typed
with the persons who do not turn in lost and found
articles but keeps it saying "Finders keepers, losers
weepers"—fountain pens, etc.
Same type of persons who stand on the corner day
after day waiting for i ride—when the bus goes right
by them. Perhaps they do not realize that it costs a
driver more than 10 cents to stop the car and pick
them up and stop to let them off—especially in traffic.
If you are to fussy to ride a bus then give the auto
owner a dime.
Consideration for others, and their property is one of
the aims of rehabilitation abroad—perhaps we need
some honor code rehabilitation on this campus: see that
everyone leaving the Cellar has passed by the cashier's
cage and paid for his or own check, require every bi
cycle owner to have a lock and use it. pay double
when taking a coke away from the machine area.
The greater the negligence the sooner these in
dividuals privileges will be lost. Stanford has always
had an excellent reputation concerning the standards
oi living of its students—it seems to be slipping rapidly.
