# Former Grad Student Describes Duty Abroad
## 
### 
Pfc. Elva C. Ferguson, the former
Stanford graduate student, Elva C.
Silvia, arrived in Europe several
weeks ago with one of the first
groups of women soldiers to be sent
directly to Germany to serve with
the Army of Occupation.
Her mother, Mrs. Mary Eleanor
Silvia, of Santa Clara, received a
letter last week from France, where
the WAC and her companions were
sent as replacements for girls who
have been serving overseas, many
for as long as two years. Pfc.
Ferguson told of her experiences
from the time her group sailed by
troop ship for Europe until their ar
rival at a forward staging area,
where they paused for final classi
fication before proceeding by air to
their assignments in Germany.
The former school teacher enlisted
in the WAC in April, 1944, and after
volunteering for overseas duty and
passing rigid examinations was clas
sified as interpreter. With a selected
group of WAC soldiers she sailed j
from an East Coast port a little over
a month ago.
Troop Ship to England
After an uneventful trip across the I
Atlantic, the girls boarded a troop j
train bound for the English Channel |
port of embarkation. The "quaint" j
train was the usual English war
time train with compartments and
no aisle, no sleepers, no diners. Dur
ing the trip the WAC girls dined
on "K" rations and water, which
was reported "very good." The fol
lowing morning, after hot tea and
sandwiches served by British women
on the outskirts of London, the train
continued to an English Channel
port.
France
The crossing to France was made
through mine infested waters, and
took the better part of a full day,
Pfc. Ferguson said. She said the
American soldiers in France were
very glad to see American girls.
Some of the Gls told the WAC girls
the French "hate the Americans—
would rather have the Germans than ,
us."
The girls were taken to the Am
erican mess hall for lunch, and aft
erward were given two blankets
and other equipment, and were
marched, "loaded like donkeys," to
the train station. This train was a
captured German train made up of
cattle cars which the Nazis had con- i
verted to a troop train by installing
rough wooden benches without j
backs.
Ragged Children
Pl'c. Ferguson described the utter |
desolation they passed through on
their trip through northern France.
All about were wrecked stations,
bombed bridges, and ruined homes,
some of which had curtains made of
rags. En route, the train stopped ;
and a "chow line" was set up along
the tracks. Ragged children came
to beg for scraps of food, and people j

came from nearby with cans and
buckets to beg for what was left
after they ate, she said.
Arriving, finally, at their staging
area, the girl soldiers were wel
comed enthusiastically by American
boys from back home, who ran
among the girls, each trying to find
someone from his home state to talk
to.
First Shower-Bath
Writing from the WAC camp at
the staging area, Pfc. Ferguson told
of the first shower she and her com
panions had had since leaving the
United States. The camp, situated
in a "beautiful forest," was describ
ed as primitive, without such con
veniences as mattresses, floors, light.-*
or running water—other than the
welcome shower-baths. The girls
caught up on their laundry at the
nearby river, while waiting for their
final assignment and the trip by air
to Germany.
Pfc. Ferguson, who holds a
Masters degree from Stanford, did
her undergraduatework at San Jose
State College and the University of
California. Prior to her enlistment
in the Wac, she taught in San Fran
cisco high schools for four years.
