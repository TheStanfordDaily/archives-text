(Don was sports editor of the
Daily in 1943. He is now sport
ing an Army Air Corps uni
form. . . . Editor's Note.)
After two years of waiting to see
a professional ball game, we went
to San Francisco this last Sunday to
see the Seals play Seattle in a twin
bill. All we have to say as a re
sult of sitting through 4V-> hours of
play is that it will be perhaps an
other two years before we see a pro
fessional game. That, kiddies, was
definitely not a bunch of pros play
ng ball but instead a bunch of
rank amateurs masquerading as
paid men.
We noticed one good thing how
ever. and that was the outstanding
play afield of the Rainiers. Their
infield is excellent, Their base-run
ning is also very good. It's very
understandtable why they are in
second and why the Seals aren't.
What I can't understand is why the
Seals aren't in the cellar, but then
I haven't seen Bobby Joyce pitch.
From talking with quite a few
men from the Big Ten, it sounds
very much as if they would like a

working agreement with the Coast
Conference in regard to the Big Ten
champ meeting the PCC title-holder
in the Rose Bowl each New Year's
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio State,
and Wisconsin agree that that is the
best way to find the mythical na
tional champion. We agcept.
Things that amaze us ... . Why
former Stanfordite Ted Kenfield,
now at Cal after spending a year at
Nebraska, should ever try to steal
the ax. Can't understand why the
Braves aren't higher in the National
League race what with Holmes,
Cooper, Medwick. Tobin. and Javery.
Can't savvy the present predicament
ot the Brownies considering they
have virtually the same outfit that
took the pennant last year. The
last amazing thing is Army ineffi
ciency. 'Nuff Said.
