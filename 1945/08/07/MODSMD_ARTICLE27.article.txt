# McBain Gives Talk on Recent Visit Abroad; Praises Russian Spirit, Scientific Adances
## 
### BILL FILERS 
Soviet scientists and government
officials "are desperately in earnest
in their desire to share everything
they can in science for the good
humanity," observed Professor
James W. Mcßain, eminent Stan
ford chemist, in an address to Cali
fornia Newspaper Publishers at the
Stanford Union Saturday afternoon.
Professor Mcßain, with four other
world-renowned scientists, repre
sented the United States at the
220 th Anniversary of the Russian
Academy of Sciences in Russia last
month. Sponsored and financed by
the U.S.S.R., the conference included
men from all branches of science;
astronomers, meteorologists, agricul
turalists, and mathematicians were
among those who attended.
In his account of the thrilling
global trip, Dr. Mcßain said the in

vitation "was not just a gesture of
politeness," but a sincere effort on
the part of the Russians to actively
cooperate and further a free ex
change of scientific information. Dr.
Mcßain said this was the only al
ternative for the post-war world.
Soviets Send Plane
Before leaving early on the morn
ing of June 5 by special Soviet
plane from San Francisco, the pro
fessor received a telegram the night
before giving detailed information
about the trip. He passed the invi
tation among publishers attending
the luncheon along with an Egyp
tian newspaper, a ticket to Moscow's
Victory Parade, and his banquet in
vitation to the Kremlin. •
Scientists have an almost religious
admiration in Russia, Dr. Mcßain
reported. No movie star or foreign
potentate received a more cordial
welcome. Even large portraits of
famous Russian scientists are posted
in the cities.
Leningrad Hard Hit
Dr. Mcßain told how the outer
parts of Moscow were hard hit,
while the center was intact. Lenin

grad was most disheartening. Seven
out of ten of Leningrad's people
died. Their daily ration was one
piece of bread half the size of a
package of cigarettes. Many parents
gave up their ration to keep their
children from starving.
"We can't picture these things,"
the scientist commented. "The Rus
sians estimate they lost 22 million
people." In one scientific institute
alone, all the research men were
dead. The Germans lost over one
million dead in front of Leningrad.
They destroyed everything and there
was much unnecessary vandalism.
Predicts Global Vacations
Impressed by the speed of his
global adventure, the chemist
prophesied that world travel such
as this will be commonplace to
nearly everyone in a decade or so.
He said the man with even a two
weeks vacation might tour the
world.
Sidelines of the trip were just as
interesting in some ways as the
Academy celebration itself. Dr. Mc-
Bain told how one of the American
scientists dropped off to investigate
the new neolithic civilization dis
covered by the Russians on the
shores of the Caspian sea.
Sees Victory Parade
With a choice seat at Moscow's
Victory Parade, Dr. Mcßain was
able to view the flower of the Red
Army. He saw rocket guns and
seige guns. All branches were the
very best of the Army.
In the evenings, elaborate dinners
or banquets were given the group.
They attended lavish concerts —
which even shirt-sleeved working
men attended—ballets, and Grand
Opera. In Russia, everyone goes to

the theatre; all seats are usually
sold out.
Dead Soldiers Revived
Medically, the Soviets are far ad
vanced. They are experts in re
search concerned with bringing
dead soldiers back to life; also, they
lead in low temperature research.
Pei haps one contributing reason
for their scientific advancement is
the fact they allow their young
scientists to continue in their re
search. Young men are not drafted
when they reach military age if
they show any promise in science.
One of the leading physical
chemists in America and an expert
on the theoretical chemistry of
soaps. Professor Mcßain is a Davy
Medalist in the Royal Society. His
book and papers on chemistry have
been translated into Russia.
He speaks again this evening at
San Francisco's Palace Hotel under
the auspices of the American Rus
sian Institute.
