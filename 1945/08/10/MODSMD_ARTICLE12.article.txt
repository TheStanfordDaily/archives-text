So far this summer the estimation of the Stan
ford Chapter of "Save-a-FightingMan's-Life" has
dropped to a new low in the eyes of the Red
Cross and, we are sure, in the eyes of the fight
ing man. Stanford pledged that thirty students
would donate their blood on the first and third
Thursdays of each month; not once this quarter
has the campus quota been filled.
When the sign-up sheet on the Engineering
corner was "lifted" by some unauthorized per
son a few weeks ago, it was necessary—for
safety's sake—to post the donating appoint
ments on the War Board office door. This slight
inconvenience to students may have accounted
for the recent slack in donors but it does not
serve to excuse those dormant donors who sit
away their summer siesta waiting for the other
fellow to sign up in their stead.
Although we may not deserve it, the Blood
Bank is giving us one last chance on Thursday
to help clear Stanford's weak summer record
and our own conscience. Appointments may
be made for 11:20 and 11:40 a.m. and 12:20 and
12:40 p.m. Anyone 18 or over may give blood
if he is in good health; all those under 21 must
have their parents' signed permission on a
blank which may be obtained at the War
Board office in the Union.
Transportation to the Palo Alto Community
Center is furnished by the Red Cross, which is
more than anxious to accommodate 30 campus
donors on Thursday.
