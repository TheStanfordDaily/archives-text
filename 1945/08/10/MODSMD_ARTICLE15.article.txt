# "Oh Say Can You See..."

Well-meaning Palo Alto theatres still are running
that National Anthem film strip. This was fine back in
Pearl Harbor days when Americans needed little
spurts to stir their patriotic fervor. It does seem
slightly superfluous today .... for several reasons.
Certainly, we haven't won yet. We're still doing
our share here at home. But we believe we're past
the stage where we need the anthem played every
evening to spur us on to buy war bonds, give blood,
and aid the Red Cross.
The Banner is very beautiful. But wouldn't we
hold it more sacred if it didn't become a common and
oft played as a jazz tune? Asking a theatre audience
to stand and sing it every evening when they seek
escape and relaxation from the warring-world cer
tainly doesn't incite patriotism.
The Stanford students we've talked to feel our local
theatres are doing just a bit of unnecessary flag
waving. We'd prefer to show our patriotism in just
a little deeper way. We would be pleased if they
would delete the film.
â€” Bill Eilers.
