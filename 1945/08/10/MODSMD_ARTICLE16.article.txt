### CYCLONE COVEY 
OUR GOOD MUSIC-MASTER. FERENC MOLNAR,
will join the Albencri Trio tonight in a Mozart piano
quartet.
Mr. Molnar is one of the leading violists and cham
ber musical authorities of the world, and while at Stan
ford was one of the most overworked and underap
preciated teachers of all the faculty.
He will have, however, the eternal thanks of a small
but continuous collection of musical amateurs who
year after year were chief beneficiaries of the sym
phony orchestra and chamber ensembles which he
pioneered in a University where non-profit-making
cultural values have traditionally suffered deemphasis.
* it *
TUESDAY'S TRIO CONCERT helped prove that
musical passages long accepted as beautiful are some
times even prettier slower. The most notable interpre
tative point of the Tuesday performance was the non
acceptance of orthodox tempos. But this would be
more significant still in works of Mozart and Bach
than in Schubert and Beethoven. For you cannot
by quick scanning elicit the full value from anything
beautiful. But one day we will come perhaps to place
a higher premium on the beauty of the music than on
the exhibitionism of its playing.

TONIGHT WE HEAR Mendelssohn's Trio in D
Minor, which was written when the great Violin Con
certo had been in composition for a year; Mozart's
Piano Quartet in E Flat, which was written just after
the Marriage of Figaro; and Brahm's Trio in C. the
composition of which in part overlapped that of the
Second Piano Concerto.
