So far, the only announcements on the fighting in
Manchuria are coming from the Japanese. They re
port two Russian drives, one along the rail line branch
ing from the Trans-Siberian and entering western
Manchuria near the source of the Amur river, and one
from the Maritime Provinces.
These threaten to turn both ends of the Amur River
Line, but the pair of pincers that they form are very
widely separated, and thus difficult to co-ordinate,
and also fighting perpendicularly to the southern tribu
taries of the big river. They are probably designed to
draw Japanese mechanized units to the flanks, thus ex
posing the center. The Red Pincers' main problem now
seems to be to maintain a foothold on the Japanese
bank.
We can expect more general fighting to develop, and
also a drive from Outer Mongolia towards Peking, to
cut off Japanese troops south of Manchuria.
FUTURE
If this is not done, the Japanese units in the South
might withdraw to a line behind the Yellow river. This
would shorten their frontage, and squeeze out many
units for action in the north. One of the big factors,
however, will be the state of the Chinese railways.
Heavy air attacks against Mukden and Peking would
certainly form a bottleneck to Japanese troops move
ments, because these two cities are nodal points for
the main enemy communications.
Meanwhile, another city has been atomic bombed.
The main defense the enemy can dream up so far
is to evacuate his main cities, and inclement weather
might help him out.
But the main early stage of the war in Manchuria
will probably be aerial. The best Japanese defense is
to operate against the main Russian bases of Irkutsk.
Urga, and Vladivostok, and also against the two
Trans-Siberian railroads. The best offensive prepar
ation by the Allies would be action against Peking
and Mukhden. and thus the main news in the begin
ning will come from the sky.
