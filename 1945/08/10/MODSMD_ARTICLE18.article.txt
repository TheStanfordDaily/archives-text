# Play Costumes To Be Colorful
## 
### 
The coming production of Pearl
Buck's "'My Indian Family" has
spuried the imagination of the
costume department, and the cre
ations will add an exciting and col
orful atmosphere to the play, , ac
cording to department members.
The designers consider the cos
tume for Rashid as one of the most
interesting. Rashid, to be played by
Robert Duke, is a young Indian
scientist who has returned to his
country from an English university.
"His long, richly decorated coat pro
vides a strong contrast to the simple
western suit," says the costume staff.
Maryann, Rashid's American wife,
who will be dramatized by Lorna
Robertson, will wear a sari, a native
Indian costume, aside from her
western dresses.
Students who participated in the
designing and construction of cos
tumes are Elizabeth Wattenberger,
Howard Campbell, William Melton,
Fred Triplett, Judy Sharader, Mary
Kenney, Jack Taylor, Jane Sauls
berry, and Murray Stirton.
