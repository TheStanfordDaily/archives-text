Several people have asked us why
Stanford can't return to the gridiron
warpath this fall. The war might
be over. The N.R.O.T.C. will be
here at the beginning of Fall quar
ter.
Resuming football is more than
hiring a publicity agent to whoop
it up, or placing an order with
Spalding Athletic Goods for fifteen
footballs.
Definite arrangements—well in ad
vance—must be made. A coaching
staff must be had, something Stan
ford does not have now. San Fran
cisco sport scribes have picked ev
eryone from Anarchy Schwartz to
Dud DeGroot to be head mentor,
but there is no official word as yet
on the selection.
The Pacific Coast Conference has
already had their yearly parley. A
schedule has already been drawn up.
An entire revision would have to
be made, no hard task, but a point
to consider.
That Stanford could have fielded
a competent football squad will not
be denied by us, but it is now en
tirely too late to think about that.
The best we can do is wait for the
basketball team the first of the year.
Here and There
The keen horseman, Richard Bow
er, informs us that a snazzy little
nag named Muligatawny is running
in the Russian sweepstakes next
Saturday Don Langendorf was
the "father" of the idea that Stan
ford visit a Cal game annually. . . .
Baseball practice starts in January.
Those interested in the national
pastime might go over and see Harry
Wolter. . . . Eddie Arcaro, a leading
jockey, feels that the present weight
limits are too steep. . . . Why don't
more of you go to the softball games?
Stanfordites, playing under the ban
ner of Phelps-Terkel, are now in
second place. With a little support,
the boys could easily grab the pen
nant.
