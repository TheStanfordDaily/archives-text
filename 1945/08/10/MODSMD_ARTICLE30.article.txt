It still cannot be determined at
this headquarters why a normal
enough looking, red-blooded bunch
of GI stags have to be almost or
dered, yes, literally pushed to dance
with the charming ladies attending
our Friday-night dances. Not only
that, but it adds so much work to
the Officers-of-the-Day's extra-cur -

riculai burden that he can just bare
ly drag himself to his snug GI cot
after the evening's festivities. Some
of our'side-line Lotharios are even
loathe to cut in on buddies, giving
as a typical excuse: "Aw, sir, it
wouldn't be fair to separate them
now." Yea verily, chivalry is not
dead, just dormant. All that can be
said is that Stanford "Joe" had best
become more socially aggressive or
he will find himself dancing with
his roommate at the next shindig.
Women thrive on popularity, va
riety and polite chit-chat and most
of 'em will seek other fields if you
can't provide it. So look to your
laurels now and make your social
plans definite and more binding.
Only 75 more shopping days 'till
the Navy comes, and then, brother,
watch out!
It is noticeably apparent to the
watchful eye that by this time most
of the fog has lifted from over-taxed
crania, circles are disappearing from
beneath worn, blood-shot eyes, and
smiles are returning to haggard,
drawn faces. Fourth and eighth
week exams (depending on where
you are) are over—some survived
unscathed, others, I fear, still carry
wounds from which there is little
chance of recovery (N.B. —No Pur
ple Hearts issued for the "Battle of
Stanford"). However, no matter in
to which category you fall, no mat
ter how nice it would feel, don't
relax now because it's fatal in six
languages. Just remember — mid
night oil is not rationed, and the
next four week will roll around be
fore you know it!
