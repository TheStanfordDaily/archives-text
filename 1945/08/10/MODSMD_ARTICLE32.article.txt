Contrast was the keynote of the
type of games played in the ERC
league as sized up with those of the
two ASTP loops. None of the
youngsters' contests finished with a I
score in single digits, while only
one team of advanced men reached
the ten runs-or-more mark.
An interesting note also is that
except for one case, a forfeit, all
of the losers in the ERC games
collected the same number of runs,
eleven. The la & 11> outfit
swamped 4a & 4b, 20-11; lc & 2a
defeated 3c & 4c, 14-11; and 3a
& 31) squeezed out a 12-11 de
cision over 5b & 2b. The forfeit
was the result of the failure of
sb-2 & 5c to put in an appear
ance for their scheduled tilt with
2c & sa.
The results of the ERC matches
only befuddled up the leadership
worse than before. Five of the eight
teams are tied for first while two
outfits are only one game behind.
That means that only sb-2 & 5c can
be counted as out of the running.
A few of the leaders are bound to
topple next week, however, as some
of them will be playing each other.
In the Co. A league, E-l T-3 de
feated the league-leading EE-G's,
8-6. This EE-6 loss coupled with
the CE-4's 14-2 shellacking admin
istered to the ME-4's. leaves the
Civils with an outside chance of
grabbing the pennant yet—if they
can take the loop leaders next week.
Such a result would necessitate a
playoff between the same two teams
for the company championship.
CE-5 (Coots) of Co. C took over
the top spot in their organization

by outplaying their CE-5 brothers,
the Tigers (?). The ME-6's were
idle, thus slipping behind a half
game.
Another intra-curricular rivalry
featured the two E-l, T-3 teams oi
the Co. C loop. Sees. 1 & 2a took a
(5-3 verdict from sees. 2b & 4 thus
strengthening their bid for third
place.
