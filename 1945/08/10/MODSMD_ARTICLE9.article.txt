# Technical Shortcomings Mar Palo Alto Educational Film
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
TITIAN. THE BOY PAINTER
is a probable landmarking venture
of the Palo Alto Children's Theater

into the medium
of the motion
picture. It is a
film intended for
distribution to
schools and mu
seums. and will
show four times
more in its cur
rent run at the
Commu n i t y
Center: this aft
ernoon. tonight,
tomorrow after
noon. and to
morrow night.
Its production

was predicated on the noble assump
tion that "human beings have a need
. . . to enter worlds larger than their
own and there encounter people dif
ferent from themselves . . .
This motivation and the composite
ofiort lavished on the production
make it a venture which verily
ought be encouraged. But espe

cially since there likely will be sue- j
cessors to Titian, we must not let j
its efforts and aims sway us from an
accurate appraisal.
Titian suffers first of all from being !
an adaptation of a play. Even the
highest-paid Hollywood profession- j
als have not learned to make over |
a play into a movie without retain
ing the constrictions of the stage, j
Titian is inartistically stalled by a
succession of set stage scenes. And
their continuity is unrhythmical and j
unsatisfactorily swift.
The second most serious draw
back is also technical. The sound
is not precisely synchronized or
true in timbre, so that lips move
to wrong words and voices sound
unnatural. The color is overbril
liant, the background music over
loud. and the scenes for the most
part lack depth of perspective.
Because of these three factors the
audience is discomfited by the im
pression that the screen is close
upon them, yet, for the pageant na
ture of the play, they would like
to sit back and view it peacefully


Johnny High
The Stanford scenery steals the
show. Stanfordites will recognize the
green foothills, the in-rolling fog,
the ripening wild oats, the Encina
trees, and even the grazing cattle.
It is supposed to be Italy.
The background music, which is
excellent, is anachronistic by more
than 200 years; but its style is old
enough to modern ears for an effec
tive flavoring, and it further dem
onstrates the practicability of an en
semble over an orchestra, for ade
quate background color.
A number of familiar campus
people are met in the cast: Howard
Campbell, Johnny High, Lorna
Robertson. William Melton, Ches
ter Barker, and Charles Smurr.
Of these. Iliijli presents the most
distinct cinematic possibilities,
though they are not here ex
ploited appreciably.
Tlie best single performance is that
of the 1 little girl, Barbara Daven
port, who is fetching.
The costumes are imposing, and
a midway series of montages is the
most striking sequence.
A final word on the movie as a
whole. Much of its educational value
is lost in the superficial handling
both of the historical material and
of the dramatization. There is
sparse attempt at subtleties of visual
expression and little exercise of
cutting skill for movement toward
climaxes.
It is said that professionals from
Hollywood were imported to pro
duce and direct. Was that Holly
wood. Nova Scotia? It is not nice
to gyp trusting children.

the ripening wild oats, the Encina

It is supposed to be Italy.
The background music, which is
excellent, is anachronistic by more
than 200 years; but its style is old
enough to modern ears for an effec
tive flavoring, and it further dem
onstrates the practicability of an en
semble over an orchestra, for ade
quate background color.
A number of familiar campus
people are met in the cast: Howard
Campbell, Johnny High, Lorna
Robertson. William Melton, Ches
ter Barker, and Charles Smurr.
Of these. Iliijli presents the most
distinct cinematic possibilities,
though they are not here ex
ploited appreciably.
Tlie best single performance is that
of the 1 little girl, Barbara Daven
port, who is fetching.
The costumes are imposing, and
a midway series of montages is the
most striking sequence.
A final word on the movie as a
whole. Much of its educational value
is lost in the superficial handling
both of the historical material and
of the dramatization. There is
sparse attempt at subtleties of visual
expression and little exercise of
cutting skill for movement toward
climaxes.
It is said that professionals from
Hollywood were imported to pro
duce and direct. Was that Holly
wood. Nova Scotia? It is not nice
to gyp trusting children.
TITIAN. THE BOY PAINTER
is a probable landmarking venture
of the Palo Alto Children's Theater

into the medium
of the motion
picture. It is a
film intended for
distribution to
schools and mu
seums. and will
show four times
more in its cur
rent run at the
Commu n i t y
Center: this aft
ernoon. tonight,
tomorrow after
noon. and to
morrow night.
Its production

was predicated on the noble assump
tion that "human beings have a need
. . . to enter worlds larger than their
own and there encounter people dif
ferent from themselves . . .
This motivation and the composite
ofiort lavished on the production
make it a venture which verily
ought be encouraged. But espe

cially since there likely will be sue- j
cessors to Titian, we must not let j
its efforts and aims sway us from an
accurate appraisal.
Titian suffers first of all from being !
an adaptation of a play. Even the
highest-paid Hollywood profession- j
als have not learned to make over |
a play into a movie without retain
ing the constrictions of the stage, j
Titian is inartistically stalled by a
succession of set stage scenes. And
their continuity is unrhythmical and j
unsatisfactorily swift.
The second most serious draw
back is also technical. The sound
is not precisely synchronized or
true in timbre, so that lips move
to wrong words and voices sound
unnatural. The color is overbril
liant, the background music over
loud. and the scenes for the most
part lack depth of perspective.
Because of these three factors the
audience is discomfited by the im
pression that the screen is close
upon them, yet, for the pageant na
ture of the play, they would like
to sit back and view it peacefully
