# Technical Shortcomings Mar Palo Alto Educational Film

### CYCLONE COVEY 
TITIAN. THE BOY PAINTER
is a probable landmarking venture
of the Palo Alto Children's Theater

into the medium
of the motion
picture. It is a
film intended for
distribution to
schools and mu
seums. and will
show four times
more in its cur
rent run at the
Commu n i t y
Center: this aft
ernoon. tonight,
tomorrow after
noon. and to
morrow night.
Its production

was predicated on the noble assump
tion that "human beings have a need
. . . to enter worlds larger than their
own and there encounter people dif
ferent from themselves . . .
This motivation and the composite
ofiort lavished on the production
make it a venture which verily
ought be encouraged. But espe

cially since there likely will be sue- j
cessors to Titian, we must not let j
its efforts and aims sway us from an
accurate appraisal.
Titian suffers first of all from being !
an adaptation of a play. Even the
highest-paid Hollywood profession- j
als have not learned to make over |
a play into a movie without retain
ing the constrictions of the stage, j
Titian is inartistically stalled by a
succession of set stage scenes. And
their continuity is unrhythmical and j
unsatisfactorily swift.
The second most serious draw
back is also technical. The sound
is not precisely synchronized or
true in timbre, so that lips move
to wrong words and voices sound
unnatural. The color is overbril
liant, the background music over
loud. and the scenes for the most
part lack depth of perspective.
Because of these three factors the
audience is discomfited by the im
pression that the screen is close
upon them, yet, for the pageant na
ture of the play, they would like
to sit back and view it peacefully
