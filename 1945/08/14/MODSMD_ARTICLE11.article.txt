## Students in Waiting 
### 
We do a lot of waiting. And we do a lot of
griping about our waiting.
We wait impatiently for the line in the Cellar
to move so that we can have our coffee only
to wait again for our change at the Cashier's
Cage so that we can wait to buy cigarettes
from Pete.
Then there's waiting for the Dailys to come
out followed by waiting for 32 minutes for the
bell to ring after we've read our Dailys. Once
out of class we wait to cross Quad between kilo
cycles .... wait for ten minutes on each foot
to get a book out of the Libe .... wait for the
11 a. m. mail to be sorted.
Off to lunch and more waiting. Either for a
double at the Cellar counter or for a table at Lag
after the doors open. More waiting at lunch—
to be served if you're eating; to clear if you're
hashing.
We wait for the little green bus to Paly and
then for a little green share-the-rider.

But today instead of waiting, all keyed-up with
nerves on edge, we are waiting quietly and for
the most part —in silence. Waiting for a short
note from Tokyo to Geneva.
