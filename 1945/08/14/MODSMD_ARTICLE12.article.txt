THE CORN IS GREEN—now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
Bette Davis has reached that "awkward" age

at which she can neither play
a "sweetheart" or a "mother"
role convincingly. In "The
Corn Is Green" she is cast in the
role created by Ethel Barrymore
I'on the stage, and this reviewer
is of the opinion that the broth
ers Warner backfired when
they didn't secure the services
of Miss Barrymore for the screen

version.
The story is laid in a small Welsh mining
village at the turn of the century where la Davis
sets up school for the illiterates of the town.
One of her pupils, Morgan Evans (played by
newcomer John Dall) shows exceptional
promise and Miss Davis spends three years of
her time and 113 minutes of your time giving
him a proper education.
In doing this Evans is involved in a rather
clandestine love affair, but in the end he is ac
cepted into Oxford University and everybody's
happy, with the exception of those who paid to
see the picture.
"The Corn Is Green" is a rather devitalized
version of "How Green Was My Valley" and
Miss Davis gives anything but an inspired per
formance in the role of the prim Miss Moffat,
[ohn Dall shows promise, even though his act
ing may be a little too theatrical. In conclusion
we might say that without Ethel Barrymore,
The Corn Is Green" is about like Oxydol with
out Ma Perkins.
The second attraction, "Hitchhike to Happi
ness," stars that yokel comedian, A 1 Pearce.
It's another one of those stories dealing with
'he heartaches and disappointments on Broad

way. I'll bet they ate this up in Watsonville
Junction.

"The Picture ct Dorian Gray," after an unex
plained delay of six weeks, is finally coming
to the Stanford Theater Thursday.
