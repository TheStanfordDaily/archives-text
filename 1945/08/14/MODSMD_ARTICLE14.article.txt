will be more far-reaching than even Physics 23
majors can imagine. For not only has it revo
lutionized warfare, but it will find a place in re
vising entertainment, advertising, family life,
etc....
Already cartoonists are shaking in their paste
boxes as the atom bomb has thrust Buck Rogers,
Superman and the Bat Man back with Neander
thal Man.
The Boogey Man, long a standby of exasper
ated parents, is out of a job. You may have

fairway.
Carmen Verandah, the Souse - American
Atomic Bombshell, is on the lookout for a new
routine. Idea men write to Box 3014, home of the
Peninsula's only Bi-weekly Daily.
"Crispy-Crackly-Cruncliies" will be shamed
into faint squeeks—or even silence—when the
nation's kiddies turn to the new and improved
"Crrrash and Crrrumble" breakfast food,
handled exclusively by Atom Bomb, Inc.
And from the Chappie, winter quarter 1948,

Gazette:
"Trouble with the Neighbors? Here's your
answer—an Atomic Bomb kit. Takes only
32 men to assemble.
Midget models for the kiddies."
