Apparently some Stanford civilian students
cannot see any purpose in the playing of our
National Anthem except "when Americans
need little spurts to stir their patriotic fervor.
At least that is the feeling that Mr. Eilers stated
last Friday—and a feeling which seems to pre
vail among many other students.
Now it can be said that we have won. Mr.
Eilers says that we have been doing our share
at home and we are "past the stage where we
need the anthem played every evening to spur
us on to buy war bonds, give blood, and aid the
Red Cross." It appears as if not the National
Anthem, but some force much more powerful,
is needed. Evidently "we" have not been do
ing our share at home if Stanford cannot even
produce thirty students as blood donors twice
a month.
The Banner is very beautiful. It is so beauti
ful and is the symbol of so much in the Ameri
can way of thinking that today thousands of
Americans are not standing in a theater for their
national anthem. No, they are lying down—in
graves on foreign soil.
Besides those who can never return, we
wonder what opinion those who soon will re
turn would have of the people back home who
feel it unwise for a theater to play the National
Anthem every evening because they "seek
escape and relaxation from the warring world."
'Leave those worries to the boys fighting over
seas' was their inner motto.
We of the ASTP—we, to whom the war has
not approached very closely—cringe at the ap
pearance of such ideas. To us and any other
servicemen, The Star Spangled Banner is in
trinsically an underlying guiding spirit. We
are sorry that some of those who have fought
the battle back home have never realized that
the Banner is more than a goad for patriotism.
