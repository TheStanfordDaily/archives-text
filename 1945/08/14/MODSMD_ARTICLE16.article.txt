Alter a rather slow start, Co. A
gained sufficient momentum to out
score Co. C. 44-8, in the battalion
swimming meet held last Saturday
afternoon in the Men's Pool. Each
company captured four firsts but
''A" took two seconds and one third
more than "C" to gain a winning
margin.
Lt. Runyon's boys began with a
bang as their 100 ycl. freestylists,
Matulich and Miller, took first and
second in that event. Jennings then
won the backstroke but Rael, A
company's only contestant in this
event, managed to salvage a second.
01' the ensuing three events, how
ever, Co. A won the three firsts and
two of the seconds—plus one fourth.
Barrington and Wolf gathered the
underwater-swim-for-distance laur
els; Patterson and Boone nailed
first and third with C's Fletcher
taking second in the 50 yd. breast
stroke; Martin and Grundfest then
proceeded to run a one-two in the
50 yd. freestyle.
Phillips temporarily revived Co.
C's hopes by shading Wagner in
the diving event. A short time later,
however, first and third spots in the
75 yd. relay clinched the champion
ship for A company. Nevertheless,
still in the light, Co. C came back
to win the concluding event, the
200 yd. freestyle relay.
Between each event the AST's 50
piece band rendered some Stanford
numbers.
On Saturday, Aug. 25, a meet will
be held featuring army men in com
petition with civilians. Three con
testants of each side will be entered
in each of the eight events—loo yd.
breaststroke, 100 yd. backstroke, 50,
100, and 220 yd. freestyle, diving,
200 yd. freestyle relay and 150 yd.
medley relay.
