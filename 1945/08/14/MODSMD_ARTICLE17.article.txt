### 
Responding to two alarms, the
Stanford Fire Department, under
the direction of Fire Chief John M.
Marston, battled a burning stack of
baled hay in the field north of
Branner Hall Sunday at 10:55 p.m.
Quick action by the firemen brought
i the fire under control, but it was
after midnight before all smolder
ing bales were finally extinguished
and the area declared safe.
Fiin Chief Marston wishes to ex
tend his appreciation to the Toyon
men and the soldiers from Encina
i whose enthusiastic assistance helped
J to keep down the damage and aid
in putting out the fire.
