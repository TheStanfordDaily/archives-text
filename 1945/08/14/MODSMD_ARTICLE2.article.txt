According to a message received at 10:51 p.m. yesterday
from the Japanese Domei news agency, the "text of an Imperial
message accepting the Potsdam declaration will be forthcom
ing."
At press time, the Japanese surrender was still not official,
as it had been announced neither in Geneva nor from Wash
ington.
The announcement, transmitted in Morse code by the Do
mei agency, was reaeived exactly 63 hours and 45 minutes
after Secretary of State James Byrnes replied to the Tokyo
request for a conditional peace.
As pointed out by a 8.8.C. broadcast, the Japanese mes
sage states that Japan has accepted the Potsdam declaration
and says nothing whatsoever about the later demands con
cerning the status of the Emperor.
In spite of the fact that the news is still not official, news
of the broadcast is being carried by all three large press asso
ciations, United Press, International News Service, and As
sociated Press.
