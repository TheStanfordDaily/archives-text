# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### ART LEYINSON 
Who said the Chicago Cubs would
win the National League pennant
this season? Nobody ever predicts

the Wrigley out
fit to win at the
beginning of the
season, but every
few years the
club manages to
surprise every
one, including
themselves, by
copping the flag.
This seems to be
one of those un
predictable years
They could sud-

denly go into a nosedive and wind
up in fifth place, but that doesn't
seem very plausible now.
Charlie Grimm was in the man
agerial doghouse several years back,
and Jimmy Wilson was shoved into
the main spot, but he only had a
mediocre career, so they brought
Smilin' Charlie back from the Mil
waukee club. He has been so suc
cessful that there is talk that Le
land Stanford MacPhail might nab
him for the Yankees.
The pace-setter of the Cubs is Bill
Nicholson. Bill always manages to
hit a home run when it counts the
most, and he covers right field like
a hawk. The other two outfielders
are Harry "Peanuts" Lowry, the
diminutive player from Los Ange
les. and Andy Pafko, who also cov
ered the outfield gardens for the
Angels a few years back. Both boys
are hitting surprisingly well.
At the hot sack is Stanley Hack.
He has been with the Cubs so long
that most fans just take for granted
his spot in the lineup. Another old
timer, Phil Cavaretta, is at first
base. The team indeed will look
mighty strange when these two
players are no longer with the gum
club dynasty.
A couple of new fellows, John
son and Merullo, round out the in
field. Neither one is sensational,
but they are the best the Cubs can
produce !iovv.
Clyde Passeau is the mainstay of
the Moundstaff. Hank Bowery, the
old Yankee who passed on to the
Cubs via the waver route, ought to
help the club considerably. Hank
Wyse, Starr, and Derringer com
plete the staff.
The way it looks now, it will be
the Cubs and the Detroit Tigers in
the World Series. Washington was
up in the fight, but with H. B.
>Greenberg rounding into shape, the
Tigers can't miss. What a team they
would have if Dick Wakefield were
playing. May next year, though.
