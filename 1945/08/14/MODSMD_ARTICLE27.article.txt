# Peninsula Flight School Reports 'Business Boom'
## 
### BILL EILERS 
"Cinch. Simple as driving a Pon
tiac," boasted Stan Hodge.
"Simpler—no traffic," chimed Sal
ly Dungan.
Yep. flying's just that easy and
that much fun. We proved it last
Saturday. Ten minutes from Stan
ford up University Avenue and
down Middlefield Road, we were on
the Progressive Flying Field, stand
ing in tlie prop wash of a bright
yellow, sturdy Piper Cub.
Stan and Sally had just come
down from their first lessons. Costs
$5 for each half-hour lesson, and
with eight hours' teaching, you can
solo. Then you have a Piper by
yourself for $3.50 an hour. Not
many people "solo" in traffic in their
cars after only eight hours' instruc
tion.
Progressive is one of two fields
that have flight instruction on the
Peninsula; the other's at Belmont.
Back in operation only three weeks
now that wartime flying bans are
easing, enthusiastic Jack Simonic,
field manager, will tell you business
is really booming. In three weeks,
he's enrolled 40 in school, hopes to
hit 75 capacity soon. Fifteen Stan
fordites are attending.
"Flying is really going to pyramid
now," Jack predicts. Piper Cubs
cost $2150 now if available. But
plane manufacturers plan to market

a substantial single-seater soon for
$650. All prices will go down. Si
monic believes. There are 12 pri
vate ships on the Progressive Field
at present. Other fields scattered
over the Peninsula have hundreds
more.
Simonic has three instructors —
men who taught Army and Navy
Pre-Flight and Civilian Pilot Train
ing programs before the war. Li
censed mechanics on the field con
stantly check the planes.
"Safety is very important to us,"
said Simonic. "We haven't had any
accidents at the field yet. When you
consider a plane takes off every ten
minutes or so during the day, it's
a fine record.!'
Stan Hodge learned a lot in that
first lesson, despite the fact the
dashboard was as simple as a Pon
tiac. He taxied down the field, got
the feel of the stick as the instructor
took off, practiced simple turns and
co-ordination.
In another article on flying, we'll
discuss advanced lessons (how you
can get your private license), how
much your plans will cost, and the
prospects for heliocopters.
If you want a lesson tomorrow,
call Bob Jones at 8976. He can ar
range transportation to the field it
prospective Stanford pilots are car
less. 112 Meanwhile, notice the yellow
Pipeys with the red noses flying
over Stanford.

Stan Hodge learned a lot in that
first lesson, despite the fact the
dashboard was as simple as a Pon
tiac. He taxied down the field, got
the feel of the stick as the instructor
took off, practiced simple turns and
co-ordination.
In another article on flying, we'll
discuss advanced lessons (how you
can get your private license), how
much your plans will cost, and the
prospects for heliocopters.
If you want a lesson tomorrow,
call Bob Jones at 8976. He can ar
range transportation to the field it
prospective Stanford pilots are car
less. 112 Meanwhile, notice the yellow
Pipeys with the red noses flying
over Stanford.

"Cinch. Simple as driving a Pon
tiac," boasted Stan Hodge.
"Simpler—no traffic," chimed Sal
ly Dungan.
Yep. flying's just that easy and
that much fun. We proved it last
Saturday. Ten minutes from Stan
ford up University Avenue and
down Middlefield Road, we were on
the Progressive Flying Field, stand
ing in tlie prop wash of a bright
yellow, sturdy Piper Cub.
Stan and Sally had just come
down from their first lessons. Costs
$5 for each half-hour lesson, and
with eight hours' teaching, you can
solo. Then you have a Piper by
yourself for $3.50 an hour. Not
many people "solo" in traffic in their
cars after only eight hours' instruc
tion.
Progressive is one of two fields
that have flight instruction on the
Peninsula; the other's at Belmont.
Back in operation only three weeks
now that wartime flying bans are
easing, enthusiastic Jack Simonic,
field manager, will tell you business
is really booming. In three weeks,
he's enrolled 40 in school, hopes to
hit 75 capacity soon. Fifteen Stan
fordites are attending.
"Flying is really going to pyramid
now," Jack predicts. Piper Cubs
cost $2150 now if available. But
plane manufacturers plan to market

a substantial single-seater soon for
$650. All prices will go down. Si
monic believes. There are 12 pri
vate ships on the Progressive Field
at present. Other fields scattered
over the Peninsula have hundreds
more.
Simonic has three instructors —
men who taught Army and Navy
Pre-Flight and Civilian Pilot Train
ing programs before the war. Li
censed mechanics on the field con
stantly check the planes.
"Safety is very important to us,"
said Simonic. "We haven't had any
accidents at the field yet. When you
consider a plane takes off every ten
minutes or so during the day, it's
a fine record.!'
