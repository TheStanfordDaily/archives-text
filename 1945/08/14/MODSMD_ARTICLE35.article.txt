"This is the day for which peace
loving peoples throughout the
world have fought and prayed.
It is a day in which there is
lifted from the hearts and minds
of home loving people every where
a heavy weight of dread and
suspense.
The last of the aggressors who
plunged the world into years of bit
ter and costly turmoil has been beat
en to his knees. In every home
there is a sense of relief that the
need for destructive combat has
ended and that the sacrifices of so
many loved ones have borne the
fruit of victory.
Here on the California home
front in the midst of joyous vic
tory celebration there must be a
realization that the meaning of
this V-.I Day is two-fold. Work
ing together as citizens of our
state and nation and with our
associates in the United Nations'
cause, we arc giving it first the
significance of a military victory.
It is yet to be determined if this
day is to be the greatest day in all
our history or just the end of an
other war. What it comes to mean
will depend upon how we use the
freedom that is now being made pos
sible for the entire world and how
we use the machinery of the United
Nations to prevent future wars."
â€”Karl Warren,
Governor of California.
