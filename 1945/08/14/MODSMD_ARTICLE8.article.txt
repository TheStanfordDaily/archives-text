Your attention is called to the fact
that in the May 24. 1945. issue of
the Stanford Daily there appeared
an article entitled. "Molotov, Stan
lord Carillon. Topics of 'New York
er' Pun: Lawson Describes Chimes "
One paragraph of this article reads
as follows:
"In the Mission Inn at River
side. California, is a fourth
pseudo-carillon built by the J. C.
Deagan Company, manufacturers
of door bells. Their product con
sists of elongated vibrating tin cans
which can be amplified from
church belfries. The Deagan Com
pany incorrectly calls these tin
cans 'carillons'."
We have been informed bv the
J. C. Deagan Company that the fore
going statements are absolutely in
correct. We have been informed
by the J. C. Deagan Company that
the true facts of the matter are as
follows:
"The Deagan Company is in its
fifith year of business and is the
world's largest manufacturer of
tower bells, chimes, carillons, and
other percussive musical instru
ment*. The Deagan Company has
nevet manufactured door bells.
"As defined in Webstei's New

International Dictionary, a bell is 'a
hollow metalic vessel .... giving
forth a ringing sound on being
struck' and a carillon is 'a set of
bells played by machinery OR by
finger keys'. Thus the instrument
which the Deagan Company in
stalled at the Mission Inn at River
side, California, is a carillon in ev
ery sense of the word, since it is
composed of bells, melodies are
played on it BOTH by machinery'
and by 'finger keys'.
'Far from being 'vibrating tin
cans.' the bells of the Mission Inn
Carillon are constructed of the fin
est bell metal and are guaranteed
for 99 years. The carillon contains
25 bells, with a range of two octaves,
from C to C. chromatic. The bells
are played both manually from an
electric console and automatically
from a Deagan Electric Player
which utilizes perforated music
rolls.
"Deagan tower bells have in them
selves sufficient volume, carrying
power and richness of tone, as to
make unnecessary any artificial or
synthetic build-up. Thus Deagan
towei bells are never 'amplified from
church belfries'.
"For more than fÂ»0 years the

Deagan Company lias been recog
nized as the world's leading au
thority on matters pertaining to
tone, tuning, musical pitch and
acoustics. Deagan hells have been
acclaimed by such world-famous
musical authorities as Dr. Leopold
Stokowski, Dr. Walter Damrosh.
Percy Grainger, the late Dr. Fred
erick Stock, Erno Rapee, the late
John Philip Soma and many
others.
"The list of hundreds of purchas
ers of Deagan bells includes such
names as Walter P. Chrysler. Pierre
S. du Pont, James Ward Packard,
William Wrigley, Jr., Rodman Wan
amaker, Mrs. E. L. Doheny, R. B
Bennett, former Premier of Canada
and many others of prominence
affluence and discernment."
The quoted remarks of Mr. Law
son should not be understood as
an expression of the views of this
newspaper or of (he University.
Mr. Lawson has no authority to
speak for the University, which
sincerely regrets this incident and
offers its apologies to the Deagan
Company, Any criticism. e\ -
pressed or implied, of the Deagan
Company or of it l * products i*
herein withdrawn and retracted.
