"I am'not convinced that we will
have perpetual peace, but I know
that we must work for it, and it is to
this end that the Library on War
and Peace is dedicated," stated
Herbert Hoover yesterday in ac
cepting a set of recordings of the
San Francisco Conference sessions.
The recordings, a gift of N.B.C.
to the Hoover Library, were pre
sented to Mr. Hoover at a session
of the Radio Institute by John YV.
Elwood, manager of station KPO.
In a talk made to Radio Institute
members before the presentation
ceremony, Mr. Hoover spoke of the
increasing influence of radio in in
ternational affairs. He pointed out
that the international agreement of
1926 which alloted to each of 72
countries a fixed wave length is one
of the few international agreements
to have survived the war.
Mr Hoover suggested that radio,
although instrumental in bringing
about a more rapid close of the war
by speeding up communication be
tween countries, had not been used
to its greatest advantage in the past
week.
"A lot of valuable time could
have been saved by direct radio
communication between Tokyo
and the capitols of the allied
powers," the former president ex
plained.
In answer to a question about pub
lic control of short wave stations,
Mr. Hoover said he favored private
operation, since "progress comes
through free competition." At the
same time, Mr. Hoover deplored the
variety of advertising which is cur
rently popular over privately owned
stations.
"It seems to me that the state
of the nation's health must be at
a pretty low ebb either to need
the pills and powders wc are
urged to take on every hour and
half hour, or to tolerate the jingles
which come with them." com
mented Mr. Hoover.
