# 'Family' Has Class; Play Lacks Form, Force

### 
Pearl Buck's "My Indian Family"
was taken out of Pearl Buck's hands
last night when Aline MacMahon.
Robert Duke, and Lorna Robertson
opened as leads on the first night
of the new play.
As polished a production as Stan
ford has seen for a long time. "My
Indian Family" owes much of its
successful - entertainment - value to
the deft and delightful settings of
John F. Sollers, the entrancing sun
set-ot-deep-blue-evening effects of
lighting directors Lawrence Tucker
and Wendell Cole, and the enhanc
ing but not distract ingly beautiful
costumes by Muriel Lievsay and
Elizabeth Wattenberger.
MacMahon Charm
As the devoted but wisely-loving
mother of a winning daughter, Aline
MacMahon presents such a charm
ing characterization, that we would
be willing t6 spend the rest of our
evenings in her company even with
out the Cobras and Sweeper, though
of course they added to the pleas
antry.
Robert Duke accomplishes a diffi
cult thing, and acts manly, yet in

love with his wife, bereft, and de
pendent on his mother-fn-law.
Just Isn't Drama
Minor characters in the play per
haps did the most to keep what is

: a dreadfully undramatic drama from
becoming not just dragging, but
| torpid. First among the minor char
acters, and one who might well
have helped to inject more conflict
into this smoother-than-glass play,
was Atha Hillback as the stuffy, but
refreshingly outspoken, English wife
'bearing the burden.'
There was so little to bring out
any characters in strong dramatic
relief, that the Untouchable. Wil
liam Melton, the Prince of Ram
pore. W. !». Owens, and Maharaj-
Waller Palance, stood out as re
i markably fine characterizations
and as strong as the main char-
I acters.
We could give more bouquets
than we have space to the sustain
ing and thoroughly complementary
acting of Frank Mesple, John High.
William Lucas, Barbara Welch,
j Harlene Adams. Howard Campbell.
1 Unforunately, the shifting ap
proaches to each act. no doubt the
result of the difficulties arising from
! suiting novel to play, make the
. roles of the minor characters and
