## Thanks an Awful Lot 
### 
We may have done our victory celebrating
up and down the Peninsula, but we came back
to the campus for meals. Thanks to the loyalty
of more than 65 regular dining hall employees
and many student hashers who voluntarily lim
ited their own celebrating to between-meals
hours, the Union, the Cellar and Lagunita were
able to feed us when doors of Peninsula res
taurants slammed shut in our faces.
Not only the year-round employees but also
the summer-only helpers from Paly High stuck
at their posts during the hectic holiday. One
dependable lad — a Cellar dishwasher—com
muted from Sunnyvale.
While eating places from San Mateo to San
lose "made no bones about" locking up to go
on a two-day spree, campus dining room em
ployees were earning the sincere appreciation
of stranded students and faculty members.
Thanks an awful lot.
