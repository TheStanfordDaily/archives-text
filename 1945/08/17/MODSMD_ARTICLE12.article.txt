# A Missing Key
## 
### 
Someone who took advantage of the oppor
tunity to use the Music Listening Room in the
Union on Monday "walked off" with the key.
And as a result the room is permanently locked
and will not be reopened until the key is re
'urned.
Many music students depend on using the
records for completing their class assignment;
many other listeners depend just as heavily
on the room for relaxation.
