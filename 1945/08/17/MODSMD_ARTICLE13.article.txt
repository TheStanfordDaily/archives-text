### DICK BOWER 
THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAYâ€”now playing
it the Stanford Theater.
Even the severest of "cinecynics" will take delight in

seeing "The Picture of Dorian
Gray," the screen adaption of Oscar
Wilde's tale of sin in 19th century
London. An excellent M-G-M cast
gives this story of riotous living a
silbaued, polished rendition, which
makes the film all the more effec
tive.
The plot revolves around a por
trait of Dorian Gray made when
he was twenty-two. Dorian wishes
that the painting might grow old

instead of himself, and strangely enough, his wishis
granted. Goaded on by George Sanders, he devotes
nis life to sin in the best "Rubaiyat" fashion, his mis
deeds being reflected by the portraint.
The title role is played by one Hurd Hatfield, a
newcomer to Hollywood, who turns in a delicate,
scholarly performance. George Sanders, when not
drinking sherry wine, serves as a mouthpiece for Oscar
Wilde and recites many sparkling witticisms. We've
never seen the irresistible Mr. Sanders in finer form
and he lends the film an ulti-sophisticated touch.
Donna Reed, who is seen as Dorian's one legitimate
lover, registers solidly as the film's only "pure"
dement.

M-G-M- is to be complimented for screening Wilde's
"touchy" book. Not since "Double Indemnity" has this
reviewer seen such a smoothly-paced, unified film
as "The Picture of Dorian Gray."

There seems to be a controversy raging between
army students and civilians as to whether the local
movie mills should play "The Star Spangled Banner."
The 4-F's claim that it is hard on their blood pressure
to stand for 60 seconds, while the campUs soldiers
insist that it reminds them of the battlefield and all
the hardships they've missed.
It reminds me of a movie'l once saw called "Storm
in a Teacup." I think that it's really very inconse
quential whether we stand up while a dime store Hag
flutters in front of a dollar store fan.
After seeing what both servicemen and civilians were
doing to the American flag on Market Street Tuesday
night, I can experience no "spurt of patriotism" when
the Stars and Stripes dangle in the breeze.
