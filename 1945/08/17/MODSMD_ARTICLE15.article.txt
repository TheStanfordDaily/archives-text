NOW THAT THE WAR IS OVER . . .

. . . and now that gasoline is back we predict
the end of the out-staring campaign between
weary SHARE-THE-WALK-ers (whose outlines
are imprinted forever in the Bookstore benches)
and the petroleum-pinching drivers who RIDE
ALONE AND LIKE IT (with the sole exception
of Dr. C. Wilson). With rationing lifted, pedes
trians will be able to tote their own gas flasks
which, complete with siphon and gauge, should
insure them pleasant transport to any spot in
Palo Alto within sprinting distance of the Kings
ley Croaking Center. Whether post-war pedes
trians will be given rides as far as Mayfield
depends upon later scientific additions to the
volume of the gas flask. As for a time estimate
on this achievement, your gas is as good as
mine.
. . . Lag may trade in some of its stored-up
parsley on a newer model.
. . . the Class of '46 may find time to complete
its plans for a gambling ship to glide on Lagu
nita's waters. According to the '46-ers their gen
erous gift to the University is not designed to
offer competition to the little red boathouse—
but will be merely their answer to the problem
of keeping the students on the campus. In
time, the blueprints (which are being drawn up
by ASTudents in their spare time) may include
an annex to house a part of the Library on West
ern Civilization. As facilities will be limited on
the gambling ship, the Independent Room will
remain in the History building but each student
will be urged to hang his favorite Paleolithic
Pin-up on the ship. Thus much of the pleasant
atmosphere of the original library will be pre
served in moving. (Ants must of course be
caged, then issued SB cards.)
. . . we must bid farewell to that most familiar
of all expressions capable of producing global
guffaws, "Doncha know there's a war on?"
