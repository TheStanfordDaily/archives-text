In answer to the article on the Star-Spangled Banner
that was inserted in the August 10 issue of the Daily,
we have the following comments in reply:
It is not only the war that makes our National
Anthem dear to the hearts of all true Americans. In
peace as well as in the war, the Star-Spangled banner
deserves the honor and respect of every American.
We don't consider standing for our National Anthem
an effort. Unfortunately, there will always be Ameri
cans who have to be reminded of their duties and obli
gations to our great country. These obligations hold for
peace as well as war time.
Yes, the war may be over but the Star Spangled
Banner is more than a wartime song to indicate "spurts
of patriotic spirit" in the American people. The spirit
of our anthem is the spirit of liberty itself, the very
same liberty that men died for at Valley Forge, at
Chateau Thierry, and on the battlefronts of Asia.
Is it too much of an effort to stand for several sec
onds in respect to our anthem and our flag? Then
let us make this great sacrifice and stand in honor of
those who fought and died for us.
It is indeed a sad state of affairs when our sacred
anthem is considered "superfluous, no matter wha' the
occasion. Surely, no man who has fought for our na
tion shares such a feeling. Every soldier's heart fills
with pride when he hears it played anil he is indeed
proud to stand in reverence—although many whose
feelings are the strongest are no longer able to stand.
