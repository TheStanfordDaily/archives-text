### GEORGE BRUNN 
"My Country" by Russell W. Dav
enport. Simon & Schuster, New
York. 1944.

Mrf Davenport
has been, among
other things, a
business man, an
editor of "For
tune," and Wen
dell Willkie's
campaign man
ager. In "My
Country" he tries

to be a poet. The book, published
late last year, has gone through a
number of editions. No doubt it
appeals to many who believe they
have a poetic soul.
Modern poetry has often been ac
cused of being too obstruse, of be
ing intelligible to no one but the
authors and perhaps not even to
them. "My Country" goes to the
other extreme. Its words and
imagery are simple, its theme clear:
"Freedom is not to limit, but to
share;
And freedom here is freedom every
where."
Destiny in IVIom
It is a pity that this work which
talks about freedom on every one
of its sixty-odd pages does not give
a more concise concept of it than
saying that we can learn its mean
ing from our men dead on foreign
fields. We read of the "spirit of
Tarawa and Kwajalein," we learn
that "America is not a lond of ease,"
but that she lives "like destiny in
Mom, who cooks on gleaming stoves
her special fricassee," we hear of
"the glowing seed of God that lives
within" and of "the dream of prog
ress to infinity," and yet at the end
we are confused and we feel that
to the author himself freedom is
something very mysterious, that can
be talked about, but not analyzed.
Confused
Any idea that is worthwhile can
be expressed so that it is intelligible
to most people. Poems can inspire,
but ooems that are prententious and
confused cannot.
Mr. Davenport is evidently sincere.
"Let us not fear man, let us fear
only what he believes in." "Let us
search,", he advises, "let us reread
the chapter of our time to relearn
the truths that might have been
self-evident."
Not American-Ripe
His search, however, leads no
where. Only at moments does he in
quire into the meaning of his fine
phrases. He takes the easy way out:
our questions, he concludes, are
questions "for which we are not yet
experienced, not yet American-ripe,
not positive." Alas, we aren't Am
erican-ripe, and must therefore be
satisfied with pretty generalities and
dramatic expressions reminiscent of
wartime advertising copy accomp
anied by a picture of a wife gazing
dreamily across the :;ea.
