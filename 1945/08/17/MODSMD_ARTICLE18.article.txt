uate who sailed for Africa as a Red
Cross worker in 1943 and has been

yesterday.
It reports that outside .Bergamo,
the workers went past groups of
cheering civilians, captured Facisls.
German prisoners and 'ladies' with
shaven heads to Italian villages on
the way to their Bergamo destina
tion.
"We asked if we were on the right
road to Bergamo, where we wanted
to spend the night. We were told
that a German armored column had
broken through from the south about
15 minutes from us. They had cut
through between Bergamo and
Brivio and were expected to arrive
momentarily.
"Tank drivers were passing and
grimly expecting to have to clean
up the situation unless the Germans
surrendered.
"We accordingly decided to find
lodgings in Brivio as it was getting
dark and a thunderstorm had be
gun. Almost immediately when
we entered the village we were tak
en in hand by Partisans who led us
to their headquarters.
German Nurses
"As we entered the room fdled
with an cxcited rabble, with much
display of red kerchiefs and car
bines we heard the mutterings of
'Tedescha?' and realized we might
well be taken for German nurses
(our uniforms are almost identical).
We suddenly found that we had
matsered some rapid Italian.
"Having convinced the Partisan
commander it was essential for us
to have a private house with garage,
we were taken to a luxurious ex
fascist villa, given the key to the
gate, and left to roam our estate at
will with assurance as to our abso
lute safety and privacy.
Mussolini Dead
"The next morning we learned
that Mussolini had been executed
the night before, not thirty miles
from our village of Brivio, and the
Northwestern German Army was in
the process of being surrendered to
General Crittenberger of IV Corps.
On May 2 we heard the Italian cam
paign was officially over."
