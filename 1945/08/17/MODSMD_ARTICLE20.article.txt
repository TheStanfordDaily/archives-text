| damage control officer, was on the
j deck when a survivor of a plane
! crash was seen clinging to a life
raft 50 yards from the ship. He,

seeing that the survivor was be

to help himself in any manner, had
a line attached to his waist, jumped
into the sea and swam to the sur

sea and low temperature of the
water, Lt. Rothschild held on to the
survivor until the ship's company
was able to bring them both aboard
ship."
