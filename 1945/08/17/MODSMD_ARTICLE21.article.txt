# Aline MacMahon Now Familiar to Students
## Actress Stands in Cigarette Lines; Seen at Libe, Cellar 
### DICK BOWER 
That familiar looking person
whom you've seen in the Cellar and
around the campus isn't a long-lost
friend of yours—she's Aline Mac-
Mahon, veteran of many a Broadway
and Hollywood production. Miss
MacMahon is at Stanford this sum
mer in the capacity of artist-in
residence. More specifically she is
appearing in the first presentation
of Pearl Buck's new play, "My In
dian Family," which opened last
night at the Memorial Theater for
a three night run.
Miss MacMahon arrived on the
campus less than a month ago,
but in that short time she has
become assimilated into Stanford
life, even to braving the cigarette
lines and dining at Rickey's Studio
Club. When asked for her reac
tion to Stanford, all Miss Mac-
Mahon could do was smile en
thusiastically and say "the Farm
is lovely."
After attending Barnard College,
Miss MacMahon began her acting
career at the Neighborhood Theater,
one of New York's pioneer "little
theater" groups. She was associated
with this and the Dock Street
Theater in Charleston for four years,

during which time she met F. Cowles
Strickland, director of "My Indian
Family."
Soon Miss MacMahon headed
westward and it was in Los Ange
less that she first attracted the at
tention of Mervin Le Roy. promi
nent Hollywood movie man. who
gave her a role in the film "Five
Star Final." Since that time she
has heen alternating between the
legitimate stage and the silver
screen. Miss MacMahon wistfully
recalled the many "types" she has
been given in Hollywood produc
tions, running from secretaries
with "hearts of gold" to pioneer
women crossing the plains.
Hei major film role, Miss Mac-
Mahon believes, is that of the mother
in the recent M-G-M- hit, "Dragon
Seed," also a Pearl Buck story.
Another stage and screen person
ality present at Stanford this sum
mer is Robert Duke, who will soon
be seen in the Republic film, "Angel
Comes to Brooklyn." Mr. Duke will

year in the John Carradine Shake
be remembered for his work last
"Iago" in "Othello" and "Laertes"
in "Hamlet."
"My Indian Family" tells the story
of an American girl, portrayed by
Lorna Robertson, who marries an
East Indian, to be played by Mr
Duke. The couple is accompanies
to their home in Akbarabad, a small
Indian village, by the girl's mother,
played by Miss MacMahon.
Other members of the Stanford
Players cast include John High,
who lias been seen in many camp
us productions; William Owens of
the law faculty who will portray
the native ruler uf the state in
which (he play's action occurs;
William Lucas of the Speech and
Drama department, cast as a fami
ly friend who vigorously opposes
inter-racial marriage; and Mrs.
Atha Ilillback, another Stanford
player "veteran," who enacts the
role of an English woman who has
never tried to understand the
dclicate Indian situation.
Mary Lou Papousek, David Crabb,
Fred Triplett, Barbara Welch and
Bill Melton round out the cast,
which consists entirely of the Stan
ford Players and faculty, with the

exception of Miss MaeMahon and
Mr. Duke.
"My Indian Family" was drama
tized from Hilda Wernner's novel
by Miss Buck and promises to be
powerful and dramatic adaptation,
as the original book was loaded with
many colorful episodes. Tickets are
now on sale for this world pre
miere at 90 cents. Reservations may
be made by phoning 22041.
