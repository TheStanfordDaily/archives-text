# 'Indian Family' Brings Lavish Sets to Stanford
## 
### 
Pearl Buck's new dramatization,
"My Indian Family," will employ
two of the most lavish sets ever
presented on the Memorial Audi
torium stage. The first shows the
deck of a P and O ship on the way
to India and the second displays
the living room, an inner room, and
the garden of an Indian home.
These rooms are on different levels
to indicate the room divisions.
The costumes, like the settings,
will be accurate in detail through
the cooperation of local Indian resi
dents with the costume department
headed by Muriel Lievsay. Eliza
beth Wattenberger is the assistant.
The colorful and exciting cos
tumes represent a fusion of the rich
motifs of India with modern stage
development. The costumes of the
character Rashid represent those of
a young Indian scientist returning

from an English university and those
of an East Indian aristocrat.
Those students who have actively
participated in designing and mak
ing the costumes are Elizabeth Wat

tenberger, Howard Campbell, Bill
Melton, Fred Triplett, Judy Shrader,
Mary Kenney, Jack Taylor, Jane
Saulsbery and Murray Stirton.
The consultants for these costumes
and other matters include Mr. and
Mrs. K. L. Dixit, Godha Ram Chan
non, and Edward W. Mumby.
The member's of the stage crew
include Barbara Welch, Edward
Perkins, Lynn Shrader, and Marcel
line Simomini. Lighting arrange
ments will be handled by "Candy"
Taylor, Judy Shrader, and Carl
Data. Properties are under the
guidance of Mary Kenney, Gladyce
Strictland, Nyna Brael and Gertrude
Brash.
The play, written by Hilda Wern
her and dramatized by Pearl Buck,
is being given its pre-Broadway
showing here at Stanford.
This is the first time that "My
Indian Family" has been presented
on any stage.
