# War's End Brings No Finish to Dibble's Work
## 
### DOT ESCHERICH 
The war is over. The wild cele
brating has begun to quiet. The
thought uppermost in everyone's
mind is to get back to normal as
soon as possible and erase all traces
that there was a war.
But there is one place nearby
which cannot forget the war —there
are always new reminders. Dibble
Hospital is and will be for some
time to come the temporary home
of many veterans who are plastic
surgery and eye cases.
Stanford women have in the past
helped furnish diversions for the
patients, and plans are being made
to continue these, and to institute
new ideas in the fall quarter.
Entertainments Arranged
Lagunita and Roble have organ
ized trips there on Sunday nights
and a number of the girls have con
tinued to go out there to visit boys
they met. Each Lagunita casa and
Roble have arranged one Sunday
evening's entertainment for wai-ds
of bed patients. Naranja gave a
fashion show, and several casas have
held birthday parties and programs.
Campus entertainments, such as
the lecent Latin American Fiesta,
give special performances for Dib
ble. Stanford girls are sometimes
invited to attend the Tuesday even
ing dances at the hospital.
Skaiing Parties
The blind patients have been giv
en extra special attention with
hikes, roller skating, dancing, and
other parties. Each Thursday 15
boys go roller skating in San Jose
with Stanford girls. Mimi Kraus
kopf, USO representative on the
War Board, said that there have
been no accidents on the rink, since
it is reserved for Dibble, but that
the only unsuccessful part of the
project is that there are never
enough girls. Anyone who is an av
erage skater should be able to par
ticipate and may do so by calling
Miss Krauskopf.

Plans are also under way to have
ice skating in San Francisco next
fall, when the rink re-opens. Hikes
and swimming at Searsville are an
other part of the program of blind
I entertainment.
Friday Night Dances
One of the most successful proj
-1 ects has been the Friday nighl
| dances for the blind. These were
started Spring quarter by Mrs.
Miriam Lidster, dance instructor.
"Originally planned as a dance
, class," said Mrs. Lidster, "they have
become more of a re-orientation for
t boys who have already known how
j to dance, but need their confidence
i restored as to their ability on the
dance floor.
The girls who held Mrs. Lidster
I with these dances in the Women's
Club House in Palo Alto are usually
j from her dance classes on campus,
j They sometimes have refreshments
and programs during the intermis
sions.
One of the patients at the hos
pital summed up their situation
when he said, "When I first learned
I'd never see again, the man who
told me of my condition explained
how much luckier I was than a lot
of other guys. And that's what's
! kept me going ever since."

Friday Night Dances
One of the most successful proj
-1 ects has been the Friday nighl
| dances for the blind. These were
started Spring quarter by Mrs.
Miriam Lidster, dance instructor.
"Originally planned as a dance
, class," said Mrs. Lidster, "they have
become more of a re-orientation for
t boys who have already known how
j to dance, but need their confidence
i restored as to their ability on the
dance floor.
The girls who held Mrs. Lidster
I with these dances in the Women's
Club House in Palo Alto are usually
j from her dance classes on campus,
j They sometimes have refreshments
and programs during the intermis
sions.
One of the patients at the hos
pital summed up their situation
when he said, "When I first learned
I'd never see again, the man who
told me of my condition explained
how much luckier I was than a lot
of other guys. And that's what's
! kept me going ever since."
The war is over. The wild cele
brating has begun to quiet. The
thought uppermost in everyone's
mind is to get back to normal as
soon as possible and erase all traces
that there was a war.
But there is one place nearby
which cannot forget the war —there
are always new reminders. Dibble
Hospital is and will be for some
time to come the temporary home
of many veterans who are plastic
surgery and eye cases.
Stanford women have in the past
helped furnish diversions for the
patients, and plans are being made
to continue these, and to institute
new ideas in the fall quarter.
Entertainments Arranged
Lagunita and Roble have organ
ized trips there on Sunday nights
and a number of the girls have con
tinued to go out there to visit boys
they met. Each Lagunita casa and
Roble have arranged one Sunday
evening's entertainment for wai-ds
of bed patients. Naranja gave a
fashion show, and several casas have
held birthday parties and programs.
Campus entertainments, such as
the lecent Latin American Fiesta,
give special performances for Dib
ble. Stanford girls are sometimes
invited to attend the Tuesday even
ing dances at the hospital.
Skaiing Parties
The blind patients have been giv
en extra special attention with
hikes, roller skating, dancing, and
other parties. Each Thursday 15
boys go roller skating in San Jose
with Stanford girls. Mimi Kraus
kopf, USO representative on the
War Board, said that there have
been no accidents on the rink, since
it is reserved for Dibble, but that
the only unsuccessful part of the
project is that there are never
enough girls. Anyone who is an av
erage skater should be able to par
ticipate and may do so by calling
Miss Krauskopf.

Plans are also under way to have
ice skating in San Francisco next
fall, when the rink re-opens. Hikes
and swimming at Searsville are an
other part of the program of blind
I entertainment.
