The "reconversion" to peacetime
sports will take place as rapidly as
sportsters are released from the
armed services. It is doubtful if
baseball will be appreciably affected
this year. The season is too late.
Football—pro and intercollegiate—
will see a number of stars return
ing this fall. By the time basket
ball rolls around, bonanza days will
be back again.
Boxing in particular has suffered
from a lack of manpower. Boxers
that ordinarily couldn't land a four
round opener in the La Brea Tar
Pits Arena have been grabbing main
events in good clubs.
Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams. Bob
Feller, Joe Gordon, Dick Wakefield,
Dominic DiMaggio, Ferris Fain, all
these men—plus a good many more
—will be greeted with open arms
when they don a baseball uniform
again. Baseball, despite the pessi
mistic thoughts of many, has man
aged to play through the war. True,
sometimes the teams have looked
like a bun of sandlotters, but the
fans have been willing to put up
with it, so club owners have made
more money than ever before in the
history of baseball.
Goli is one of the few sports that
has not been hit by the war. For
one reason or another, not many
outstanding golfsters went Uncle
Sam's way. "Lord Byron" Nelson
has been playing an outstanding
game. Sammy Snead, Jug MeSpad
en. and Sammy Byrd have closely
trailed Nelson in golf play through
out the country. Ben Hogan has
just released from the army, so up
coming tournaments ought to be rip
bang affairs.
Football will not return to nor
malcy until 1946. Apparently there
will not be a mass release of men
from the services, so gridiron fans
will have to be content with a
sprinkling of old stars this fall.
Sports at Stanford
As far as can he ascertained now,
Standford WILL NOT resume in
tercollegiate football this season.
We have been unable to contact
Grad Manager Al Masters, but
those "in the know" say that ade
quate preparations were not made
soon enough for the return of
football.
As previously planned, basket
ball will be first on the sports
docket. The Pacific Coast conference
will be in full operation again.
Whether Stanford will barnstorm
in the East during the Christmas
holidays is not known yet.
