# CAT Study Terminates
## 
### 
Orders officially terminating the
Civil Affairs Training Program have
been received by Col. John R. Eden,
military commander.
The course will end this week.
Diplomas will be presented Monday
to army and navy officers taking the
training, according to Harold Fish
er, director of the training. The offi
cers will report to the Civil Affairs
Staging Area in Monterey next
week.
A.S.T.P.
Termination of the CAT program
is so far the only major change on
the campus. Colonel Eden said that
no change has yet been ordered in
either the Army Specialized Train
ing Program or the Army Special
ized Reserve Program.
No change ..has been directed in
the Civil Communications Intelli
gence School which has nearly 100
army and navy officers enrolled.
Cooperation
The official orders discontinuing
the CAT program at Stanford came
from the Ninth Service Command
and expressed appreciation to the
university for the "fine cooperation"
which Stanford gave the war de
partment in the program.
The CAT program was begun here
last fall and the present class is the
fourth which has been instructed.
Reason Unknown
It is not known today whether
the cancellation of the program a
month before it was scheduled to
end was due to there being no
further need for this kind of work
or to an immediate need for the men
in the program to serve as civil ad
ministrators in the occupation of
Japan.
