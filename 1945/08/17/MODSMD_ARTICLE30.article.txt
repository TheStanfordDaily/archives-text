# $290 Buys Flight Training
## 
### 
Today complete private pilot
training—enough to permit you to
get a pilot's license—will cost you
$290 and take three months! With
that license you can carry passengers
and fly your own plane. Here are
details on one of two peninsula flying
schools, the Progressive:
First, the beginning flyer must
have eight hours dual instruction.
Total: $80, at $5 for each hour half
lesson. Then he's allowed to solo at
$3.50 a half hour. With .'lO hours of
solo flight under his belt, the flyer
may go up for his pilot's examina
tion. A field inspector gives the ex

amination locally.
Progressive's Jack Simonic, answ
ering the heliocopler question,
claims heliocopters are much more
difficult to learn to fly than Piper
Cubs. "And," Simonic says, "it'll be
some time before they are mark
eted." Piper Cubs are still nearly im
possible to buy, and cost $2150.
About 15 Stanford students are
enrolled at Progressive. They in
clude Stan Hodge, Nyna Brael, Sally
Dungan, Barbara O'Brien, Monty
McPhee, Bob Lamar, Dick Greaves,
Bob Schmidt, Russ Corning, and
Bob Thaxton.
