# Housing Still Main Problem
## 
### 
As an increasing enrollment looms
before a post-war fall quarter, Stan
ford's complicated housing problem
is left in a state of flux by the sud
den termination of the Civil Affairs
Training School.
Navy Remains
One stable factor is that the Navy's
ROTC program remains the same:
200 reserve officer candidates will
still occupy Toyon, registering with
Stanford civilians on September 24.
This was assured yesterday by Aca
demic Vice-President Alvin C.
Enrich.
For fall quarter men, the Uni
versity guarantees: (1) higher room
rent for most to offset loss on ex
pensive fraternity houses (2) three
to a room in some cases (3) limited
choice of halls and rooms.
Women's Dorms
Roble will house first quarter
freshmen women. Branner will be
occupied by girls who were at Stan
ford last spring and transfers. Of
some 80 first-quarter women, prob
ably one-fourth will return this fall,
according to Acting Dean of Women
Anastasia Doyle. Some will join the
1500 off-campus students. Others
will try to re-enter at another time.
Plans Uncertain
Fraternities will not be able to op
erate actively as living groups next
year, according to both University
and Inter-Fraternity Board officials.
To resume living groups, enough stu
dents must be pledged to make Fra
ternity operation economically
sound.

Jusl what is being done to case
Stanford's long-run housing need is
not clear at this point. An archi
tect has been employed by the Uni
versity to study the plant and work
on plans, but actual building of
additional dormitory units has not
been announced.
AST Plans
Mr. Eurich stated that the hous
ing situation should be much more
settled by the beginning of next
quarter. Whether the Army changes
its ASTP and ASTRP programs
within the next few months will
affect the housing. Plans for Army
continued training at colleges are
under consideration in Washington.
