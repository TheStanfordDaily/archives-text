Here's Your Fire
It may have been a delayed reaction to the
Market Street victory celebration. It may have
been that end-quarter ennui or just a feeble
sense of humor which sent three pieces of fire
department apparatus screaming up the Row
Friday night in answer to a false alarm.
This alarm, sent from the fire box near Tyler,
summoned regular and volunteer fire-fighters
on fully equipped engines. From the false
alarmists point of view: after discovering the
hoax, the firemen would chuckle good
naturedly, murmur something about "students
will be students," then, oblivious to the expense
of moving equipment and the amount of person
al risk involved, the firemen would pack up
such equipment and silently steal back to the
tirehouse, still chuckling and still murmuring
good-naturedly.
To add to the "humor" of the situation, the
false alarmists planted a fire for the men to
battle when they answered the call. The alarm
ists prepared a greeting with this fire—which
by the way was burning in a lantern tied to the
alarm box.
The note read: "Here's Your Fire."
No, we aren't going to throw the Funda
mental Standard at these false alarmists; it
would be wasted on them.
We'll just sit back and wonder. We'll sit
back wherever we are—in a Cellar booth, in
a Civ class, in the Libe. And we'll wonder how
they could be here so long and learn so little.
