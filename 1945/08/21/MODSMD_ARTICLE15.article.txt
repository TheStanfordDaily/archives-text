The surrender is finally announced, and there is one
thing that is certainly clear about it. The enemy is still
the enemy, psychologically if not physically. The seeds
;>f resentment have been sown well enough so that he
will come back at the first possible opportunity. In
light of that, our policy should become one of prevent
ing revenge.
One of the proposed steps in the process is to occupy
the country for a long duration of time, and to try to
re-educate the Japanese to peace and light. This prob
ably will not work. The Japanese may simply chalk
up the occupation as another thing to be revenged,
and word of mouth propaganda at home may over
come anything we try 1o teach the Japanese at school.
The main thing the occupation will succeed in doing,
according to the odds as they stack up now. will be
to cost the taxpayers more money.
JAP GENERAL STAFF
Another proposal is to wipe out the enemy general
staff which might bo difficult, because, although the
senior officers might be eliminated, the young captains
and majors who have had staff training will be there
to lay the foundations for a new army. A better army,
perhaps, since it can look into the causes of its defeat.
About the last proposal stemming from various
sources is to eliminate Japanese industry. This would
mean that the people would probably starve, since
the land isn't capable of supporting the whole popu
lation. After tension relaxed, we would allow the Japs

to rebuild their industry—something to our credit—
but, if it was rebuilt after being dismantled, it would
probably come back by government auspices, and
that would mean the first thing on production schedules
would be war material.
PEACE PLAN
Any peace plan that we make will have to face the
fact that we cannot guarantee general interest in in
ternational affairs twenty years from now. We cannot
promise that a Senate, burdened with the paying off
of a large national debt, will be too eager to build up
a new one by a general preparedness program, or
that the people of the world will not be too engrossed
in the problems of making a living to worry about
what is happening elsewhere. This situation wrecked
the calculations made at Versailles and might ruin
those being made now in Washington.
We must adopt an intelligent national defense
policy and a calculating foreign policy, based not on
revenge but on security.
In the future, we must make the air force the chief
basis of our peacetime army. The reason for this
is that it will be feasible to hit jump off points
for Jap invasions with planes operating from our
west coast, and thus we can pin the enemy down
to bis home islands in case of new trouble. That
would mean we could afford to wait for a war
declaration before building up tbe other services.
Also, we should prevent China from sinking into
international oblivion through more civil war. We must
do what we can to help her out of her troubles, and
industrialize her through trade with Japan.
Industrialization through Japanese trades would ac
complish two things. First of all. it might make the
Japanese prosperous enough to give up any idea of re
venge as simply uneconomical, and, secondly, it would
create a strong China capable of positive action with
the concert of Nations in case of aggression in the
Pacific.
Thirdly, we must encourage Russia's development
as a maritime nation, since this would be more of a
threat to a navally stripped Japan than to the large
naval states of Europe, and also it would take some
strain off our navy piogram.
Fourthly, we must not try to eject powerful Euro
pean states from Pacific holdings, since they would
hardly be inclined to help us in return if more trouble
came from Japan.
In the last analysis, our best guarantee against Jap
anese revenge is twofold.
First, to give her something else to engross her
energies thoroughly enough (the industrialization of
Asia,) and, second, to ring her with states strong enough
to crush her and interested enough to do so in case she
again tried to expand.

to rebuild their industry—something to our credit—
but, if it was rebuilt after being dismantled, it would
probably come back by government auspices, and
that would mean the first thing on production schedules
would be war material.
PEACE PLAN
Any peace plan that we make will have to face the
fact that we cannot guarantee general interest in in
ternational affairs twenty years from now. We cannot
promise that a Senate, burdened with the paying off
of a large national debt, will be too eager to build up
a new one by a general preparedness program, or
that the people of the world will not be too engrossed
in the problems of making a living to worry about
what is happening elsewhere. This situation wrecked
the calculations made at Versailles and might ruin
those being made now in Washington.
We must adopt an intelligent national defense
policy and a calculating foreign policy, based not on
revenge but on security.
In the future, we must make the air force the chief
basis of our peacetime army. The reason for this
is that it will be feasible to hit jump off points
for Jap invasions with planes operating from our
west coast, and thus we can pin the enemy down
to bis home islands in case of new trouble. That
would mean we could afford to wait for a war
declaration before building up tbe other services.
Also, we should prevent China from sinking into
international oblivion through more civil war. We must
do what we can to help her out of her troubles, and
industrialize her through trade with Japan.
Industrialization through Japanese trades would ac
complish two things. First of all. it might make the
Japanese prosperous enough to give up any idea of re
venge as simply uneconomical, and, secondly, it would
create a strong China capable of positive action with
the concert of Nations in case of aggression in the
Pacific.
Thirdly, we must encourage Russia's development
as a maritime nation, since this would be more of a
threat to a navally stripped Japan than to the large
naval states of Europe, and also it would take some
strain off our navy piogram.
Fourthly, we must not try to eject powerful Euro
pean states from Pacific holdings, since they would
hardly be inclined to help us in return if more trouble
came from Japan.
In the last analysis, our best guarantee against Jap
anese revenge is twofold.
First, to give her something else to engross her
energies thoroughly enough (the industrialization of
Asia,) and, second, to ring her with states strong enough
to crush her and interested enough to do so in case she
again tried to expand.
The surrender is finally announced, and there is one
thing that is certainly clear about it. The enemy is still
the enemy, psychologically if not physically. The seeds
;>f resentment have been sown well enough so that he
will come back at the first possible opportunity. In
light of that, our policy should become one of prevent
ing revenge.
One of the proposed steps in the process is to occupy
the country for a long duration of time, and to try to
re-educate the Japanese to peace and light. This prob
ably will not work. The Japanese may simply chalk
up the occupation as another thing to be revenged,
and word of mouth propaganda at home may over
come anything we try 1o teach the Japanese at school.
The main thing the occupation will succeed in doing,
according to the odds as they stack up now. will be
to cost the taxpayers more money.
JAP GENERAL STAFF
Another proposal is to wipe out the enemy general
staff which might bo difficult, because, although the
senior officers might be eliminated, the young captains
and majors who have had staff training will be there
to lay the foundations for a new army. A better army,
perhaps, since it can look into the causes of its defeat.
About the last proposal stemming from various
sources is to eliminate Japanese industry. This would
mean that the people would probably starve, since
the land isn't capable of supporting the whole popu
lation. After tension relaxed, we would allow the Japs

to rebuild their industry—something to our credit—
but, if it was rebuilt after being dismantled, it would
probably come back by government auspices, and
that would mean the first thing on production schedules
