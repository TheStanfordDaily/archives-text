The Farm Figits
Even greater than the problem of What Hap
pened to Charles Boyer and Danielle Derrieux
Sunday evening, is the problem of What Has
Happened to the Ay-rab and Muriel since the
same evening. We can always tune in "Sec
ond Fidler to learn about Boyer—but we have
to wait five weeks to find out about the hidden
di-a-monds of Übenga.
Life in the Jolly Junnnnngle has made life on
the Farm a series of shakes and jitters. If you
don't believe it, just watch your fellow students
try to carry coffee and donuts from fountain to
Cellar booth.
Still what can you expect with dead week ap
proaching, with the Navy invading next Reg
Day, and with Sunday Series audiences wonder
ing whether or not Mrs. Colby is Mrs. Colby or
whether he or she is an Ay-rab impersonating
another Ay-rab who is impersonating someone
looking for the missing di-a-monds.
"King of the Wild" starring Mischa the Pelt
was probably filmed in a bivouac area in the
Moh'ave desert, where six legged bosses
abound. Muriel, the snappy dresser, will un
doubtedly set a new style in Quad clothes.
But it will be hard at first to ride a bike wearing
a formal and a polo coat.
The girl—not the bike.
With the last summer Daily coming out
Thursday and the '45 Quads becoming the '52
Quads —what hope is there of returning to the
calm and unchlorinated life of former Farm
days?
Whatever became of all those letters we
should be receiving, of the swivel chair on the
Daily Shack roof, and of the bike we "lost" last
week-
And whatever became of those Übenga
di-a-monds-
