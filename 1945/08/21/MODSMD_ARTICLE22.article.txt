Army Softball schedules were
slowed up by a week as a result of
the V-J holidays. As a consequence,
last Wednesday's frays will be
played tonight and this week's tilts
tomorrow night as planned. There
is a good possibility that all three
leagues will finish their regular
schedules with first place deadlocks.
