# And So the War Goes On
## 
### 
Where was the GI swing band at
the last Friday-night dance? Rumor
has it that Fleher and the boys were
still enjoying V-J dayâ€”Fleher has
it that the holidays prevented normal
practice.
At last the thirteen generations of
moths will be liberated as the ASC
opens the purse strings of the army
fund. For long and generous serv
ices, the Palo Alto Red Cross will
reciove a substantial donation to
help it continue its work.
Althougn no American city could
duplicate the enthusiasm that San
Francisco displayed on V-J day,
PA didn't do so badly for itself.
As the legal pass limit for ASTs
was Paly, all the soldier's energy
was naturally diverted through local

| channels. Many guilty looks have
been passed between GI and Stan
fordettes lately.

As schoolbooks gather thick layers
of dust, ASTs hold long and serious

meetings. The topic of discussion
is the best method of convincing
some high brass that ASTs make
very fine civilians. Meanwhile, no
official word has come.
Biceps grow flabby as ASTs
change their books to their right
hand. Since the departure of the
CATs, the Stanford GI is sub
servient to no one but his immediate
officers and his numerous social en
tanglements. V-J day's greatest
benefit.
Until the Navy arrives, something
new is really news!
