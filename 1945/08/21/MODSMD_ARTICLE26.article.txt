# AST, Civilian Swim Meet on Saturday
## 
### 
The Men's Pool will be the scene
of a swimming meet between an
army and a civilian team Saturday,
at 4 p. rn.
Ten days ago Co. A outscored
Co. C in a close intennural army
meet; participants in this meet
should provide good competition for
the civilians next Saturday after
noon.
The meet will consist of eight
events: the 50, 100, and 220 yd. free
styles, 100 yd. backstroke, 100 yd.
breaststroke, diving, 200 yd. free
style relay, and 150 medley relay.
Competition and spirit should be
keen, and all those interested in
swimming are welcome to watch the
meet, according to Coach Sprague.
The AST's cadet athletic officers
are now busy selecting a team to
compete with the civies. 'Most of
their choices will be based on in
dividual performances in the army's
championship meet of two weeks
ago. Your writer is completely in
the dark as to what the civilians
have to offer, and will therefore
leave that to your imagination.
All the coeds —the entire campus
—is invited, and urged to come and
witness the army in their bid to
outdo the civilians. There is a pos
sibility of the AST band playing,
although that is as yet in the stage
of uncertainty.
