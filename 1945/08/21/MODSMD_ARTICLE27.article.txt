Things we could never understand.
Why the pari-mutual odds at Del
Mar are so ci-azy. Horses that pay
$50 to win, only pay around $5 to
place or show .... Why Ad Lislca,
the Portland submarine bailer, has
never made a journey to a higher
circuit .... Why the late Keneshaw
Landis frowned upon Bing Crosby's
plan to purchase the down-trodden
Boston Braves. El Bingo, as every
one knows, is a most solid citizen.
. . . . Why Negroes are barred from
participating in professional base
ball .... Why college baseball has
never been popular.
A good friend of ours was wor
rying his head off because he
didn't have enough moolah for
Autumn quarter, so we told him
to keep his eye on April Moon
down at Del Mar. Our friend
happens to know a friend who
has a friend whose business is to
take curbstone bets—or in the
more vulgar term —operates a
bookie, so our friend dashed up
to this particular person when
he saw April Moon on the entry
sheet, and laid down $4 to win
on the horse. Well, our friend is
a very gay person these days be
cause April Moon paid $94.70 to
win, which to our friend meant
$1<5!).40 clear, or tuition money
plus enough to mess around with
at Bay Meadows. Not had, eh?
The secret success to sports is
legs. In baseball you last as long
as your legs do. That holds true
for football, basketball, golf, or any
other sport you can think of. Even
Willie Hoppe, the pool man with the
educated cue, claims if his legs
weren't in good shape he would
probably be contenting himself with
a game of pool in the evening at the
Central Avenue pool parlor instead
of shoving a cue around to the
tune of one grand per night.
A friend of ours informs us that
three big handicaps are coming up
in a week. In fact, the post time
for the first big race is 8 a. m. on
August 30.
The Racing Form confirms the
running of the hig handicaps, and
suggests that a handy little tab
sheet is a form called Elements
of Modern Economics. The Form
is never wrong, so we plan to
look over the tab sheet for some
possible advice on the sweepstakes'
The Racing Form further advises
us that we'd better not sci'atch in
these qualifying races, or we'll be
out of the running for the $143
sprints that begin on September 24.

The secret success to sports is
legs. In baseball you last as long
as your legs do. That holds true
for football, basketball, golf, or any
other sport you can think of. Even
Willie Hoppe, the pool man with the
educated cue, claims if his legs
weren't in good shape he would
probably be contenting himself with
a game of pool in the evening at the
Central Avenue pool parlor instead
of shoving a cue around to the
tune of one grand per night.
A friend of ours informs us that
three big handicaps are coming up
in a week. In fact, the post time
for the first big race is 8 a. m. on
August 30.
The Racing Form confirms the
running of the hig handicaps, and
suggests that a handy little tab
sheet is a form called Elements
of Modern Economics. The Form
is never wrong, so we plan to
look over the tab sheet for some
possible advice on the sweepstakes'
The Racing Form further advises
us that we'd better not sci'atch in
these qualifying races, or we'll be
out of the running for the $143
sprints that begin on September 24.
Things we could never understand.
Why the pari-mutual odds at Del
Mar are so ci-azy. Horses that pay
$50 to win, only pay around $5 to
place or show .... Why Ad Lislca,
the Portland submarine bailer, has
never made a journey to a higher
circuit .... Why the late Keneshaw
Landis frowned upon Bing Crosby's
plan to purchase the down-trodden
Boston Braves. El Bingo, as every
one knows, is a most solid citizen.
. . . . Why Negroes are barred from
participating in professional base
ball .... Why college baseball has
never been popular.
A good friend of ours was wor
rying his head off because he
didn't have enough moolah for
Autumn quarter, so we told him
to keep his eye on April Moon
down at Del Mar. Our friend
happens to know a friend who
has a friend whose business is to
take curbstone bets—or in the
more vulgar term —operates a
bookie, so our friend dashed up
to this particular person when
he saw April Moon on the entry
sheet, and laid down $4 to win
on the horse. Well, our friend is
a very gay person these days be
