## 
### 
Effective fall quarter, upper di
vision students will no longer be
required to take gym, Alvin C.
Eurich, academic vice-president, has
announced.
"This is .iust one of the war
time controls which we are now
releasing, and we hope that soon
we can give up more of them,"
stated Mr. Eurich.
The Academic Council, at its June
15 meeting recommended the change,
and it was approved by the Board
of Trustees the sartne month.
The physical education four year
quirement was instituted in June
of 1942 in connection with the war
time physical fitness program as a
temporary measure, and as war con
ditions relaxed, it was recalled, ac
cording to Mr. Eurich.
Autumn quarter gym will be on
the same basis as it was before the
war with required non-credit for
lower division students, and elec
tive physical education classes with
credit Tor upper division.
