### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The pressure of events in the Pa
cific has drawn our attention from
Germany, for the moment, but now
that things are settling a bit. we
can return to the question of the
future of that nation.
Potsdam
It was fairly well laid down at
Potsdam. The terms for occupation
and the possible boundries to be
drawn in the peace treaty have been
published. Many people, the most
notable of them being Winston
Churchill, have criticized the Pots
dam Declaration as laying the seeds
for new wars, while others have
defended it as very realistic.
One of the most notable features
in its favor was the idea of repara
tions in kind. It showed we learned
one lesson from Versailles, anyway.
Territory Cession
The most criticized part of it was
the cession of German territory east
of tlu* Oder and the NeLs?e to Poland

in compensation for losses to the
Soviet, but it would seem that this
would work to our advantage. Since
Poland is steadily falling under Rus
sia's political domination, the cession
would work as one to Russia, and it
would be one more obstacle in the
way of any rapprochment between
the iwo.
De-Industralization
The terms of de-industrialization
are not so realistic. The manufac
turer turning out tractors can shift
to tanks and machine guns, and the
chemical plant making such harm
less things as Aniline dies for bio
logical use would change to making
TNT and Picrate detonators as soon
the political temper of the times
allowed him to.
In the last analysis, the extent of
de-industrialization will depend on
the industrial areas that Germany
loses sovereignty over.
Maintaining Terms
The best way to maintain the

terms is an out-and-out cession of
| the major ones to various European
j powers.
There remains the salient fact that
: Germany is not self-sufficient agri
culturally, and the crowded condi
! tions in the country due to there
: moval of Germans from their lost
areas will make things work. Per-
I haps the only solution would be to
I make the diversion of some indus
| trial goods to Germany part of the
j terms of cession of German in
| dustry.
! Industrial Potential
At any rate, the sum of the mis
| takes at Versailles could be stated
as giving the Germans enough reas
on to hate us by taking their terri-
I tories and their money, but leaving
them enough industrial potential to
do something about ihat emotion.
We have given them more reason to
them with too much industrial
| hate us now, so let us not leave
potential.
