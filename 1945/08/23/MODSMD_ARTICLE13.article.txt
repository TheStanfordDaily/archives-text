## An Obituary 
### 
"THE FEW VERY RICH can get their educa
tion anywhere," said Senator Stanford in his
last letter to David Starr Jordan. "They will be
welcome to this institution if they come, but the
object is more particularly to reach the multitude
—those people who have to consider the ex
penditure of every dollar."
But over the years the Stanford Family has
winced to see this University become, perhaps
partly out of necessity, a rich man's school.
And for whatever reasons and however justi
fiable, the hard fact is still that Stanford has
tailed a fundamental aim of its founders.
With us they would watch sadly next month
the death of the only active adherence to the
original ideal still remaining at Stanford, when
the University administration terminates the
Walter Thompson Co-op House.
* * *
In spite of the vicissitudes of its establishment,
the lack of University encouragement, and all
the years of the war, the Co-op has operated
continuously, has served superior meals, has
kept low prices, and still shows a surplus of one
thousand dollars. (At one time, it not only pro
vided meals for its own members, but also for
the graduate women of Hilltop House.)
During the same period, the fraternities and
eating clubs were forced to close entirely, and
the University lost money on men's halls under
its management while keeping them less clean,
serving inferior meals, and charging prices
twice as high. The meals served at the Co-op
are the best available to men, army or civilian,
on campus, and the cost of both room and board
is the lowest of any campus living group, men's
or women's.
The Co-op has been successful. It has also
iiiade a definite contribution to student life. . .
Among its members have been counted Jews,
Negroes, and nationals of twenty foreign coun
tries. And from the beginning, the operation of
the house on cooperative and democratic prin
ciples has been for the most part effective and
congenial, and for many members, a godsend.
For two successive years the Co-op ranked
first among all living groups in scholarship.
Numbers of its members have served on Excom
and Men's Council, and other offices of student
government, and have participated in every ac
tivity from the choir to intramurals to theatric
als. Numbers have held scholarships, worked
as instructors and as teaching and resident as
sistants. And no Co-op member has ever been
brought before Men's Council on a moral charge
Dr violation of the honor code.
Far from deserving termination, the Co-op

more than any single living group deserves of
ficial backing by the University.
Leland Stanford took freguent occasion to
further the cause of cooperation and cooperative
groups. He even introduced a bill in the U. S.
Senate to encourage and provide for the forma
tion of cooperatives in the District of Columbia.
And in support of it he delivered two months
later one of his rare speeches on the floor of
the Senate.
In the exercises of the opening day of the
University he was careful to point out that pro
vision had been made for freely teaching the
benefits of cooperation, through which modern
progress had been mostly achieved. "Co-oper
ative societies," he said, "bring forth the best
capacities, the best influences of the individual
for the benefit of the whole."
The doubtful venture of the founding of the
Walter Thompson Co-op was underwritten by
eighteen of the Stanford faculty, and approved
in writing by twenty-two more. The name was
in honor of the late Walter Thompson, a kindly
professor of political science, who had actively
furthered the Cooperative Movement. And
among scores of contributors, Mrs. David Starr
Jordan herself gave a table, chairs, and wicker
furniture toward the establishment of the house.
With the passing of the Co-op, and with the
imminent commencement of direct supervision
of the fraternities and other residences by the
University, and its published intention of rais
ing room rent yet again for next guarter, our
regrets are deepened that the winds of freedom
will blow henceforth less briskly.
