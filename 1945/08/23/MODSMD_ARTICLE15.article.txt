# This Is "Thirty"
## 
### 
Dead week has again taken us unawares. It
has come on tiptoe, which we feel is hardly a
fair entrance and now hovers darkly over us
with innumerable hands filled with unread
texts and empty bluebooks.
We realize that during dead week there is no
time for looking back over the guarter. In fact,
there is little time for anythingâ€”except for do
ing those thousand and one things that we
should have done during the first nine weeks.
And this dead week is no exception. We
have little time to remind ourselves of the
Farm's reconversion which begins in earnest
next guarter, of the many returning veterans,
of the Navy program, of the return of athletics,
and the new Dean of Students.
We only have time to close the summer books
with a hastily scribbled "30."
