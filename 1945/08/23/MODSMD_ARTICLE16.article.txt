### DICK BOWER 
Joe Sher would call this the "kiss-ofT." Mary A 1
Smith calls it ''30." But in any event the death knell is
ringing for summer quarter 1945—a summer that
started with a whimper and is ending with a bang.
Summer quarter was two months of guys, gals, and
Gl's. Two months into which freshman boys tried to
cram two years of education and existence. Two
months that found freshman girls trying to look two
years older by arching their eyebrows Hollywood style.
We hope that this summer was a happy one for you.
That you had your fill of Shakespeare, sociology, and
scotch. That you enjoyed your physics, poli sci. and
party-times. And that you're well stocked on literature,
logic, and Lucky Lager.
We hope that you spent lots of wind-swept days over
at the beach, riding the waves and forgetting all about
school. We hope that all the sand castles you built
are still standing.
We hope that you've learned the difference between
a CAT and an ASTP .... and between an ASTP and
an ERC. And the difference between Karl Marx and
Groucho Marx .... between a natural and a peroxide
blonde .... between a short beer and a party.
In short, we hope that you've had a great big "slice
of life" this summer—life with a capital "L."
And now your Bull Sessioner would like to wish you
the best of everything, wherever you may go. They
teach you in college not to be sentimental, but to be
hard, cold, and intellectual. That's why I'm getting
lopsidedly sentimental and wishing you, as we say in
2nd year French, "bon voyage."
