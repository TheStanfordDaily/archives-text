# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To The Editor:
When instances arise wherein a
number of aspiring young men and
women capitalists are able to
monopolize campus self-help jobs
to the exclusion of their more sin
cerely needing mates and when such
actions are tacitly condoned by the
University then we feel that it is
time for us—voices crying in the
wilderness —to ask for an investi
gation.
We can only admire those stu
dents who in addition to their
studies find—or make time—to work
for their meals or do other jobs
that aid in financing their education.
When campus sycophants (how's
that) succeed in virtually cornering
the job market we must admit that
there can still be no legitimate com
plaint.
However, when a veteran—to
whom every cent counts—finds that
a fellow-student holding four jobs
and driving two cars has cornered
the job market then we think a
complaint and a highly legitimate
one does exist. Simple logic should
point out that ,obviously, a student
that owns two cars has no right to
hold four jobs and thus stop a stu
dent from obtaining the means to
necessary money.
An actual case: Student X—he
gets his room free—as a sponsor.
Works for his meals. Has cleaning
and laundry concession. Has "coke"
concession. And owns two cars.
Student Y—who urgently needs
funds—asked if he could run the
"coke" concession. Oh no. Student
X needs the "coke" money to keep
his two cars going. Strange as it may
seem to some corpulant Stanford stu
dent Y cannot afford to buy a bi
cycle but Mr. X turns "coke" money
into two cars.
Another case: Student A holds a
hashing job where in addition to
his meals he receives one dollar a
day, he also receives free room as
a sponsor. Although this lad does
not own two cars he lives a sybaritic
beer-fed life of luxury. Said he, of
his fiity dollar (G.1.) aid, "it's enough
to keep me in beer." The sad part is
that in this case we fear it is not.
Yet this student is taking money
from other men to whom every cent
counts.
Case three: This student was giv
en the free-room job of sponsor.
Yet this man can easily be termed
quite wealthy. He expressed no end
of amazement when he heard that
a feliow student was unable to go
home over the coming vacation be
cause he did not have the necessary
train fare. "One-hundred and fifty
dollars," he said, "oh that's not
much."'
Well it may not b? much to 3 r ou.
buddy. And if it isn't, you have one
hell of a nerve taking a job from a
student who needs it.
Most universities see to it that jobs
go first to men that need them. If
there are sinecure jobs to be handed
out why give them to the sheik, who
may be Ex-com material and with
all a good fellow? Give them in
stead to the Joe to whom such help
is a necessity, who is not working
to show he has the democratic spir
it but to keep himself in food while
lie puts himself through school.
If no action is taken on this wc
will bo furnished with palpable proof
that the Stanford way of life is but
a mockery. That in affect, the
"Stanford Way" condones the
trampling of your neighbor and that
the fine talk of a "Stanford Way"
that seeks to build up good fellow
ship and consideration for others is
but a travesty.

Most universities see to it that jobs
go first to men that need them. If
there are sinecure jobs to be handed
out why give them to the sheik, who

To The Editor:
When instances arise wherein a
number of aspiring young men and
women capitalists are able to
monopolize campus self-help jobs
to the exclusion of their more sin
cerely needing mates and when such
actions are tacitly condoned by the
University then we feel that it is
time for us—voices crying in the
wilderness —to ask for an investi
gation.
We can only admire those stu
dents who in addition to their
studies find—or make time—to work
for their meals or do other jobs
that aid in financing their education.
When campus sycophants (how's
that) succeed in virtually cornering
the job market we must admit that
there can still be no legitimate com
plaint.
However, when a veteran—to
whom every cent counts—finds that
a fellow-student holding four jobs
and driving two cars has cornered
the job market then we think a
complaint and a highly legitimate
one does exist. Simple logic should
point out that ,obviously, a student
that owns two cars has no right to
hold four jobs and thus stop a stu
dent from obtaining the means to
necessary money.
An actual case: Student X—he
gets his room free—as a sponsor.
Works for his meals. Has cleaning
and laundry concession. Has "coke"
concession. And owns two cars.
Student Y—who urgently needs
funds—asked if he could run the
"coke" concession. Oh no. Student
X needs the "coke" money to keep
his two cars going. Strange as it may
seem to some corpulant Stanford stu
dent Y cannot afford to buy a bi
cycle but Mr. X turns "coke" money
into two cars.
Another case: Student A holds a
hashing job where in addition to
his meals he receives one dollar a
day, he also receives free room as
a sponsor. Although this lad does
not own two cars he lives a sybaritic
beer-fed life of luxury. Said he, of
his fiity dollar (G.1.) aid, "it's enough
to keep me in beer." The sad part is
that in this case we fear it is not.
Yet this student is taking money
from other men to whom every cent
counts.
Case three: This student was giv
en the free-room job of sponsor.
Yet this man can easily be termed
quite wealthy. He expressed no end
of amazement when he heard that
a feliow student was unable to go
home over the coming vacation be
cause he did not have the necessary
train fare. "One-hundred and fifty
dollars," he said, "oh that's not
much."'
Well it may not b? much to 3 r ou.
buddy. And if it isn't, you have one
hell of a nerve taking a job from a
student who needs it.
Most universities see to it that jobs
go first to men that need them. If
there are sinecure jobs to be handed
out why give them to the sheik, who
