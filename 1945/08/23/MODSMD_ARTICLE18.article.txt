To The Editor:
Shall wo kick this question of the
Star Spangled Banner and "spurts
of patriotism" about a bit more?
It seems that some of our fellow
students in the military are great
writers. Their words are wonder
ful pieces of literature, strewn here
and there with flowery passages
commemorating the many heroic ex
ploits and privations of our illus
trious fore-fathers. I'm sure the na
tion will remain indebted to you,

Privates, Kahn, etc., for your glor
ious panegyrics.
But tell me what induced you
to write such hyprocritical tripe?
Surely you yourselves don't be
lieve it. Do you suppose that the
average American citizen, when he
hears the National Anthem at a
theatre (three times a week) stands
out ol respect for it? No—but out of
regard for public opinion. For he
knows that Privates Kahn and
Gentile (who are the embodiment of
patriotism itself) who are seatec 1
behind or beside him will drag him
to his feet. Then he will probably
be taken out where they beat
little national spirit into him a»
end by reporting him to the local
branch of the F. 8.1.
There is a time and place for
everything. The theater is definitely
not the place for our national anthem
and ensign—especially when coupled
with "Goofy" or the latest exploits
of "The Three Stooges."
Permit me to propose a crude
analogy in comparing the spirit of
patriotism with that of religion; i.e
that on the superfluous and hypo
critical side. The body religions I
would classify under three types or
groups. First is that group which
holds those poor unfortunates whose
"consciences" will give them no
