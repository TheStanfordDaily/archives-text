To The Editor:
Shall wo kick this question of the
Star Spangled Banner and "spurts
of patriotism" about a bit more?
It seems that some of our fellow
students in the military are great
writers. Their words are wonder
ful pieces of literature, strewn here
and there with flowery passages
commemorating the many heroic ex
ploits and privations of our illus
trious fore-fathers. I'm sure the na
tion will remain indebted to you,

Privates, Kahn, etc., for your glor
ious panegyrics.
But tell me what induced you
to write such hyprocritical tripe?
Surely you yourselves don't be
lieve it. Do you suppose that the
average American citizen, when he
hears the National Anthem at a
theatre (three times a week) stands
out ol respect for it? No—but out of
regard for public opinion. For he
knows that Privates Kahn and
Gentile (who are the embodiment of
patriotism itself) who are seatec 1
behind or beside him will drag him
to his feet. Then he will probably
be taken out where they beat
little national spirit into him a»
end by reporting him to the local
branch of the F. 8.1.
There is a time and place for
everything. The theater is definitely
not the place for our national anthem
and ensign—especially when coupled
with "Goofy" or the latest exploits
of "The Three Stooges."
Permit me to propose a crude
analogy in comparing the spirit of
patriotism with that of religion; i.e
that on the superfluous and hypo
critical side. The body religions I
would classify under three types or
groups. First is that group which
holds those poor unfortunates whose
"consciences" will give them no
peace unless they arc forever re
minding their creator that they still
believe and trust in him; reminding
him what a mighty fortress he is;
telling him to rest assured that his
will shall be done on earth as it is
in heaven.

Then there are those who go to
| religious services because they
think it is fashionable; or again be
j cause of their regard for public opin
j ion. Lastly there are those who
seldom go to any church. They
I prefer to think about it. Occasion
ally Ihey are seen at the Houso of
! God, but they neither know why
| they go nor why they stay away,
j (Draw your own parallels.)

Of course I do not deny that if a
nation will be great and successful
she must have the respect, love and
confidence of her people—but that
is something that should be inher
ent in everyone of them and not
necessarily displayed at the least
provocation in writings and orations.
It is not who can endure stand
ing the longest for the National
Anthem, or who can hit its high

g's that matters —Yes, that is ''super
fluous," Private Kahn and Gentile.
You seem to believe that we
would all be greater patriots if the
i women would emulate that good ole
j girl Columbia in her wardrobe, and
, the men would commute daily in
1 the garb of Uncle Sam, lustily giv
ing out with "God Bless America"

It seems that some of our fellow
students in the military are great
writers. Their words are wonder
ful pieces of literature, strewn here
and there with flowery passages
commemorating the many heroic ex
ploits and privations of our illus
trious fore-fathers. I'm sure the na
tion will remain indebted to you,

Privates, Kahn, etc., for your glor
ious panegyrics.
But tell me what induced you
to write such hyprocritical tripe?
Surely you yourselves don't be
lieve it. Do you suppose that the
average American citizen, when he
hears the National Anthem at a
theatre (three times a week) stands
out ol respect for it? No—but out of
regard for public opinion. For he
knows that Privates Kahn and
Gentile (who are the embodiment of
patriotism itself) who are seatec 1
behind or beside him will drag him
to his feet. Then he will probably
be taken out where they beat
little national spirit into him a»
end by reporting him to the local
branch of the F. 8.1.
There is a time and place for
everything. The theater is definitely
not the place for our national anthem
and ensign—especially when coupled
with "Goofy" or the latest exploits
of "The Three Stooges."
Permit me to propose a crude
analogy in comparing the spirit of
patriotism with that of religion; i.e
that on the superfluous and hypo
critical side. The body religions I
would classify under three types or
groups. First is that group which
holds those poor unfortunates whose
"consciences" will give them no
peace unless they arc forever re
minding their creator that they still
believe and trust in him; reminding
him what a mighty fortress he is;
telling him to rest assured that his
will shall be done on earth as it is
in heaven.

Then there are those who go to
| religious services because they
think it is fashionable; or again be
j cause of their regard for public opin
j ion. Lastly there are those who
seldom go to any church. They
I prefer to think about it. Occasion
ally Ihey are seen at the Houso of
! God, but they neither know why
| they go nor why they stay away,
j (Draw your own parallels.)

Of course I do not deny that if a
nation will be great and successful
she must have the respect, love and
confidence of her people—but that
is something that should be inher
ent in everyone of them and not
necessarily displayed at the least
provocation in writings and orations.
It is not who can endure stand

Anthem, or who can hit its high

g's that matters —Yes, that is ''super

would all be greater patriots if the
