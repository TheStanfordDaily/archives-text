After successfully fighting their
way through three long terms at
Stanford, training as army engineers,
33 veterans of one of the toughest
training courses the army has to
offer are returning to their beloved
posts in the Infantry, or possibly
to another branch of service. No
one knows the ins and outs, the
traditions, the possibilities of Stan
ford as do these men.
Arriving on the 11th of December,
1944, part of the new-comers went
into the Electrical Engineering
course, while the others adopted the
Mechanical Engineer curriculum.
Since then, nine months of sweat
ing out lab periods, exams, profes
sors, and homework have changed
their titles to EE-Gs and ME-Gs;
nine months have changed the men
themselves to geniuses bursting with
knowledge which they fear to put
into use.
To celebrate their graduation, the
vets plan to take a good long fur
lough beginning September. After
college benefits have had a chance
to dissipate, they will return to the
rigors of army life. Poor guys!
We give to you the departing:
EE-G ME-G
