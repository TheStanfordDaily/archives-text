In a nip-and-tuck 2-1 contest,
the E-l, T-3 (2b & 4) team upset
the leading CE-5 (Coots) in a Co.
C match played Tuesday evening
on the sunken diamond. Twomley,
the third termers' pitcher, hurled
a masterful two-hit game while his
teammates squeezed out the two
runs needed for a victory margin.
Just three weeks ago. Twomley
pitched a no-hitter.
Activity in the Co. A league found
the CE-4's overpowering the EE-6's,
11-1, and consequently moving into
a tie for first. The same E-l ten
that toppled the Coots went gunning
for another upset last night as they
took on the ME-6's, new dwellers of
the top rung. Such an upset would
necessitate a playoff between the
Coots and the term six lads.
Two other frays were played in
the EM leagues. The above men
tioned ME-6's shellacked the E-l,
T-3 (1 & 2a), 14-2 in the "C" loop
while in "A." the ME-4's dropped
a 10-1) decision to the E-l. T-3's.
