# Parade Rest
## 
### GIESECKE 
The luminous moon glows in the
star-studded sky, the cricket's file
sings a romantic tune, Sinatra on
the air croons a captivating "There's
No You," and the AST's slave at the
desk and wish they could dash over
to Roble. After some three weeks
of "goofing off," Parade Rest once
more commands "At ease, and give
your attention."

By now the ASTwerps have a
definite opinion of the basic train
ing yet to come. Amid wild stories
from"the basic boys who know'' of
dropping in mortar shells wrong-end
first, casualty rates of the infiltra
tion course, endless nights on the
stump holes, and thrills of staying
in bed until 0500, the AST Reserv
ists as yet cannot determine how
foot-lockers are strapped on com
bat packs. But they'll get in on the
"know" shortly.

In a recent E-l term three English
class, the subject matter drifted to
the effectiveness of the sun ray gun,
a theoretical weapon developed by
German scientists. Upon hearing this
sun gun could burn down an en
tire city by magnifying the sun's
rays, one bright AST piped: "Any
city but San Francisco." Obviously
he had spent a night in Frisco clad
only in suntans.

This column sadly announces the
coming loss of a "considerable num
ber" of freshman girls at the close
of the summer term, because of de
creasing civilian living accommoda
tions caused by the navy moving in.
The news hit some campus GI Joes
hard, and it seems the navy has
won the first round without show
ing up.
