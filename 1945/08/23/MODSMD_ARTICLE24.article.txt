The war's sudden end has caused
the ERC's here to do some serious
thinking (for a change). Rumors
float through the air with the great
est of ease, and sleep is broken by
cries of "Hey, maybe they'll send us
to Japan!" I sleepily mutter "May
be—ha!" and go back to sleep. Some
boys think that we'll be discharged
soon. Others go around buying up
hats, ties and shirts from the ones
who count on leaving. The only
thing we have in common is the
way we go by friends with a glassy
eyed stare muttering, "The draft
stops in November and I'm not eigh
teen until January. Fool! Fool!"
* *
With the officers missing, the
streets look almost deserted. This
almost-deserted look is only a pre
view of things as they will be when
civilians and ASTAP men take short
vacations. At last I'll be able to get
a booth in the Cellar without wait
ing.
Now we can carry books in one
hand and ice cream cones in the
other. The number of salutes ex
changed on the campus in the last
two days, is almost nil. We really
miss some of those WAC officers,
too.
In this heat, ice-cream is sold to
us ERC's in prodigious quantities.
After food what is better than a
nap? Unfortunately most of these
naps are taken in the classroom.
One teacher was heard to remark,
"If I had a picture of this class it
certainly wouldn't be a moving pic
ture!"
