Hello, Freshman—lt's going to be
good to see all of the new Stanford
men and women that the year 1945-
46 is bringing. Pretty soon you
won't feel very new, but just as
much a part of the Stanford Family
as those who started out in 1892.
You will probably find out soon
that the Quad is not as many miles
in area as it seems, and that the
classroom numbering does follow a
system, so if you put on good hiking
boots on Reg Day you will have
strength enough to get up and go to
classes the next morning.
Some morning—maybe not this
year—you'll suddenly wake up and
realize just what this is all about—
all of the people, and things, and
ideas that are in Stanford.
Then you'll see that Stanford is
giving a lot to you, and that you are
giving something, too. About then
'you'll know why we consider Stan
ford something special. It's not just
college—it's Stanford.

You young Stanford men and
women are on the threshold of a
new chapter in your lives. Your
high school days are over and you
are embarking on a new adventure.

One of the biggest jobs that you
and I have this coming school year
is to recapture the oldtime Stanford
spirit, the kind of spirit that used to
show up best at rallies and particu
larly on autumn quarter Saturday
afternoons at the Stadium. Through
out the war years Stanford spirit
has necessarily and properly mani
fested itself in different ways. Now
the war is finally over; Stanford vet
erans are coming back to us, and the
old school is again ready to field ath
letic teams. There will be plenty of
opportunity to yell this coming year
and our job is to rekindle the Stan
ford spirit and carry it on.
You are entering a university that
is steeocd in atmosphere and tradi
tion. Stanford is a warm school. The
spirit of friendliness found here per
meates our whole being. Make use
of our "hello" tradition.
I'm very sorry that I am not able
to be with you during your Pre-Reg
program. However, we will meet
throughout the year and, I hope, be
come good friends.
On behalf of the Associated Stu

to offer and you have much to offer

Good luck.

Hello, Freshman—lt's going to be
good to see all of the new Stanford
men and women that the year 1945-
46 is bringing. Pretty soon you
won't feel very new, but just as
much a part of the Stanford Family
as those who started out in 1892.
You will probably find out soon
that the Quad is not as many miles
in area as it seems, and that the
classroom numbering does follow a
system, so if you put on good hiking
boots on Reg Day you will have
strength enough to get up and go to
classes the next morning.
Some morning—maybe not this
year—you'll suddenly wake up and
realize just what this is all about—
all of the people, and things, and
ideas that are in Stanford.
Then you'll see that Stanford is
giving a lot to you, and that you are
giving something, too. About then
'you'll know why we consider Stan
ford something special. It's not just
college—it's Stanford.

You young Stanford men and

high school days are over and you
are embarking on a new adventure.

One of the biggest jobs that you
and I have this coming school year
is to recapture the oldtime Stanford
spirit, the kind of spirit that used to
show up best at rallies and particu
larly on autumn quarter Saturday
afternoons at the Stadium. Through
out the war years Stanford spirit
has necessarily and properly mani
fested itself in different ways. Now
the war is finally over; Stanford vet
erans are coming back to us, and the
old school is again ready to field ath
letic teams. There will be plenty of
opportunity to yell this coming year
and our job is to rekindle the Stan
ford spirit and carry it on.
