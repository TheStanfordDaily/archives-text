# INJUNS GREET NEW PAPOOSES
## Pre-reg Plans---Heap Big Time 
### 
Stanford pre-registration commit
tee members yesterday turned all
out to give a real Indian welcome
to some 350 incoming freshmen in the
Farm's first post-World War II au
tumn quarter. Under the leadership
of Nancy Banning and Jack Siemer,
the new freshmen were introduced
to the beginning of a three-day
period of orientation to Stanford
life which includes not a little
Stanford "playtime."
Official pre-reging began yester
day at 8 a. m. when the entire pre
reg committee greeted the first
freshman arrivals at the Palo Alto
station. From there the would-be
Indians were taken to their dormi
tories where they met their spon
sors and where they slowly learned
to find their various ways around
the intricate corridors of Roble and
Encina. (Incoming freshmen take
note: The Class of '49 is the first
civilian class to live in Encina since
Spring Quarter of 1943.)
Aptitude Test First
At 1:30, several harried looking
individuals were seen woefully en
tering the Education auditorium
where they went through that x-igor
ous examination known as the
Stanford APTITUDE TEST. They
emerged several hours later, know
ing that after THAT, nothing could
be hard.
Later arrivals were greeted by
pre-reg committeemen when the
Daylight pulled in to the Paly sta
tion. These were rushed to dinner
at 6:15, the first meal to be served
in the dorms. Following dinner,
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women,
spoke to all new women in the Roble
lobby. At the same time in Toyon
lounge the newly-appointed Dean
of Students, John Stalnaker, gave
a welcoming talk to Stanford's long
awaited naval contingent.
The incoming freshmen wound up
the day by meeting with their spon
sors in their respective living groups
and corridors to discuss Stanford's

Honor Code, the "Frosh Bible," ;tnd
pre-reg procedure.
More and More
Today's program includes meals,
pre-reging, more meals, more pre
reging ,the English matriculation
test (better known as the English
A exam), more meals, and finally
a Jolly-Up.
Breakfast will be served in all
freshman halls at 8 this morning. At
9:30 freshman will begin their real
introduction to Stanford when they
meet in front of the education build
ing to be conducted to their advisors
for prc-registration.
Why Pre-reg?
The purpose of pre-reg is to help
lower division students plan their
courses with a minimum of confus
ion. Every student has a faculty ad
visor with whom he consults as to
his major and his proposed college
course. With the help of his advisor,
the lower division student plans his
course during the prescribed pre
registration period, so that on Reg
Day he knows exactly what he is
taking and why he is taking it.
However, actual registration must
take place on Reg Day or on the
required days following Reg Day.
Lunch will be held in all fresh
men halls at 12:15; and students
who have not finished pre-reging
may do so this afternoon from 1 to
2. At 2:30 the English matriculation
test will be given in Memorial Au
ditorium. Every freshman is re
quired to take this examination.
Jolly-Up Yet!
Dinner will be served at C to
night in all freshman halls to give
freshmen a chance to get ready for
the Jolly-Up at 7:30 in the Basket
ball Pavilion. Jolly-Ups are one of
Stanford's oldest traditions, and any
freshman who has read his "Frosh
Bible" will know that a Jolly-Up
is a no-date dance designed to help
Stanford students to become ac
quainted Quad clothes are the tra
ditional dress for these informal get
Freshmen may sleep late tomor
row morning- breakfast won't be
served until 1\ The freshman choir
will meet at 10 in the Chapel. There
will be a special early breakfast for
those who are singing in the choir.
Sing for Frosh Choir
The freshman choir is another
pre-reg tradition. It is composed
entirely of volunteer freshmen who
traditionally supply the singing for
the first Chapel Service of the school
year. The service itself will be held
at 11 in Memorial Church. Pre-reg
committee members Frank de Lisle
and Barbara Porter will read the
A.S.S.U. vice-president, will speak.
Hymns and music will be under the
direction of Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist; D. Sterling Wheel
wright, assistant organist; and Herb
ert Jan Popper, associate professor
of music.
Following the Chapel Service,
freshmen may relax until 1:30, when
they will meet on Inner Quad for a
tour of the campus and a trip to the
top of the Hoover War Library.
The only other time students are
taken as a class to the top of the
Hoover War Libe is at commence
ment when the graduating class
makes this tour as a part of Senior
Week activities.
Barhccuc Fun Time
Instead of dinner tomorrow eve
ning, a barbecue will be held at the
pit near the boathouse on Lake
Lagunita. A program and rally will
follow the dinner with President
Donald B. Tresidder, Mrs. Tresiddcr,
and A.S.S.U. President Bob Ken
nedy as guests.

day tours; Milt Levy, pre-registra
tion Saturday morning; Frank de
Lisle, information desk on Reg Day;

Sunday evening will see the end
of pre-reging, for on Monday morn
ing hordes of eager Stanford stu
dents will flock to the Ad Building
to register for Autumn Quarter, j
1945.
The Endâ€”and Beginning
It is on Reg Day that real Stan
ford life begins. Endless queues I

from in front of every window in
the Ad Building. Noise and con
fusion reign as happy Stanford men
and women renew old friendships
and compare summer vacations.
Quad salesmen are everywhere with
their never-ending question: "Wanna
'buy a Quad?"
But don't let it get you down,
freshmen. The pre-reg committee
has again come to your rescue. If
you have a problem, take it to the
Information Desk which the com
mittee is placing in front of the Ad
Building just for you. And good
luck!

Stanford pre-registration commit
tee members yesterday turned all
out to give a real Indian welcome
to some 350 incoming freshmen in the
Farm's first post-World War II au
tumn quarter. Under the leadership
of Nancy Banning and Jack Siemer,
the new freshmen were introduced
to the beginning of a three-day
period of orientation to Stanford
life which includes not a little
Stanford "playtime."
Official pre-reging began yester
day at 8 a. m. when the entire pre
reg committee greeted the first
freshman arrivals at the Palo Alto
station. From there the would-be
Indians were taken to their dormi
tories where they met their spon
sors and where they slowly learned
to find their various ways around
the intricate corridors of Roble and
Encina. (Incoming freshmen take
note: The Class of '49 is the first
civilian class to live in Encina since
Spring Quarter of 1943.)
Aptitude Test First
At 1:30, several harried looking
individuals were seen woefully en
tering the Education auditorium
where they went through that x-igor
ous examination known as the
Stanford APTITUDE TEST. They
emerged several hours later, know
ing that after THAT, nothing could
be hard.
Later arrivals were greeted by
pre-reg committeemen when the
Daylight pulled in to the Paly sta
tion. These were rushed to dinner
at 6:15, the first meal to be served
in the dorms. Following dinner,
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women,
spoke to all new women in the Roble
lobby. At the same time in Toyon
lounge the newly-appointed Dean
of Students, John Stalnaker, gave
a welcoming talk to Stanford's long
awaited naval contingent.
The incoming freshmen wound up
the day by meeting with their spon
sors in their respective living groups
and corridors to discuss Stanford's

Honor Code, the "Frosh Bible," ;tnd
pre-reg procedure.
More and More
Today's program includes meals,
pre-reging, more meals, more pre
reging ,the English matriculation
test (better known as the English
A exam), more meals, and finally
a Jolly-Up.
Breakfast will be served in all
freshman halls at 8 this morning. At
9:30 freshman will begin their real
introduction to Stanford when they
meet in front of the education build
ing to be conducted to their advisors
for prc-registration.
Why Pre-reg?
The purpose of pre-reg is to help
lower division students plan their
courses with a minimum of confus
ion. Every student has a faculty ad
visor with whom he consults as to
his major and his proposed college
course. With the help of his advisor,
the lower division student plans his
course during the prescribed pre
registration period, so that on Reg
Day he knows exactly what he is
taking and why he is taking it.
However, actual registration must
take place on Reg Day or on the
required days following Reg Day.
Lunch will be held in all fresh
men halls at 12:15; and students
who have not finished pre-reging
may do so this afternoon from 1 to
2. At 2:30 the English matriculation
test will be given in Memorial Au
ditorium. Every freshman is re
quired to take this examination.
Jolly-Up Yet!
Dinner will be served at C to
night in all freshman halls to give
freshmen a chance to get ready for
the Jolly-Up at 7:30 in the Basket
ball Pavilion. Jolly-Ups are one of
Stanford's oldest traditions, and any
freshman who has read his "Frosh
Bible" will know that a Jolly-Up
is a no-date dance designed to help
Stanford students to become ac
quainted Quad clothes are the tra
ditional dress for these informal get
Freshmen may sleep late tomor
row morning- breakfast won't be
served until 1\ The freshman choir
will meet at 10 in the Chapel. There
will be a special early breakfast for
those who are singing in the choir.
Sing for Frosh Choir
The freshman choir is another
pre-reg tradition. It is composed
entirely of volunteer freshmen who
traditionally supply the singing for
the first Chapel Service of the school
year. The service itself will be held
at 11 in Memorial Church. Pre-reg
committee members Frank de Lisle
and Barbara Porter will read the
A.S.S.U. vice-president, will speak.
Hymns and music will be under the
direction of Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist; D. Sterling Wheel
wright, assistant organist; and Herb
ert Jan Popper, associate professor
of music.
Following the Chapel Service,
freshmen may relax until 1:30, when
they will meet on Inner Quad for a

top of the Hoover War Library.

Stanford pre-registration commit
tee members yesterday turned all
out to give a real Indian welcome
to some 350 incoming freshmen in the
Farm's first post-World War II au
tumn quarter. Under the leadership
of Nancy Banning and Jack Siemer,
the new freshmen were introduced
to the beginning of a three-day
period of orientation to Stanford
life which includes not a little
Stanford "playtime."
Official pre-reging began yester
day at 8 a. m. when the entire pre
reg committee greeted the first
freshman arrivals at the Palo Alto
station. From there the would-be
Indians were taken to their dormi
tories where they met their spon
sors and where they slowly learned
to find their various ways around
the intricate corridors of Roble and
Encina. (Incoming freshmen take
note: The Class of '49 is the first
civilian class to live in Encina since
Spring Quarter of 1943.)
Aptitude Test First
At 1:30, several harried looking
individuals were seen woefully en
tering the Education auditorium
where they went through that x-igor
ous examination known as the
Stanford APTITUDE TEST. They
emerged several hours later, know
ing that after THAT, nothing could
be hard.
Later arrivals were greeted by
pre-reg committeemen when the
Daylight pulled in to the Paly sta
tion. These were rushed to dinner
at 6:15, the first meal to be served
in the dorms. Following dinner,
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women,
spoke to all new women in the Roble
lobby. At the same time in Toyon
lounge the newly-appointed Dean
of Students, John Stalnaker, gave
a welcoming talk to Stanford's long
awaited naval contingent.
The incoming freshmen wound up
the day by meeting with their spon
sors in their respective living groups
and corridors to discuss Stanford's

Honor Code, the "Frosh Bible," ;tnd
pre-reg procedure.
More and More
Today's program includes meals,
pre-reging, more meals, more pre
reging ,the English matriculation
test (better known as the English
A exam), more meals, and finally
a Jolly-Up.
Breakfast will be served in all
freshman halls at 8 this morning. At
9:30 freshman will begin their real
introduction to Stanford when they
meet in front of the education build
ing to be conducted to their advisors
for prc-registration.
Why Pre-reg?
The purpose of pre-reg is to help
lower division students plan their
courses with a minimum of confus
ion. Every student has a faculty ad
visor with whom he consults as to
his major and his proposed college
course. With the help of his advisor,
the lower division student plans his
course during the prescribed pre
registration period, so that on Reg
Day he knows exactly what he is
taking and why he is taking it.
However, actual registration must
take place on Reg Day or on the
required days following Reg Day.

At 1:30, several harried looking
individuals were seen woefully en
tering the Education auditorium
where they went through that x-igor
ous examination known as the
Stanford APTITUDE TEST. They
emerged several hours later, know
ing that after THAT, nothing could
be hard.
Later arrivals were greeted by
pre-reg committeemen when the
Daylight pulled in to the Paly sta
tion. These were rushed to dinner
at 6:15, the first meal to be served
in the dorms. Following dinner,
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women,
spoke to all new women in the Roble
lobby. At the same time in Toyon
lounge the newly-appointed Dean
of Students, John Stalnaker, gave
a welcoming talk to Stanford's long
awaited naval contingent.
The incoming freshmen wound up
the day by meeting with their spon
sors in their respective living groups
and corridors to discuss Stanford's

Honor Code, the "Frosh Bible," ;tnd
pre-reg procedure.
More and More
Today's program includes meals,
pre-reging, more meals, more pre
reging ,the English matriculation
test (better known as the English
A exam), more meals, and finally
a Jolly-Up.
Breakfast will be served in all
freshman halls at 8 this morning. At
9:30 freshman will begin their real
introduction to Stanford when they
meet in front of the education build
ing to be conducted to their advisors
for prc-registration.
Why Pre-reg?
The purpose of pre-reg is to help
lower division students plan their
courses with a minimum of confus
ion. Every student has a faculty ad
visor with whom he consults as to
his major and his proposed college
course. With the help of his advisor,
the lower division student plans his
course during the prescribed pre
registration period, so that on Reg
Day he knows exactly what he is
taking and why he is taking it.
However, actual registration must
take place on Reg Day or on the
required days following Reg Day.
Lunch will be held in all fresh
men halls at 12:15; and students
who have not finished pre-reging
may do so this afternoon from 1 to
2. At 2:30 the English matriculation
test will be given in Memorial Au
ditorium. Every freshman is re
quired to take this examination.
Jolly-Up Yet!
Dinner will be served at C to
night in all freshman halls to give
freshmen a chance to get ready for
the Jolly-Up at 7:30 in the Basket
ball Pavilion. Jolly-Ups are one of
Stanford's oldest traditions, and any
freshman who has read his "Frosh
Bible" will know that a Jolly-Up
is a no-date dance designed to help
Stanford students to become ac
quainted Quad clothes are the tra
ditional dress for these informal get
Freshmen may sleep late tomor
row morning- breakfast won't be
served until 1\ The freshman choir
will meet at 10 in the Chapel. There
will be a special early breakfast for
those who are singing in the choir.
Sing for Frosh Choir
The freshman choir is another
pre-reg tradition. It is composed
entirely of volunteer freshmen who
traditionally supply the singing for
the first Chapel Service of the school
year. The service itself will be held
at 11 in Memorial Church. Pre-reg
committee members Frank de Lisle
and Barbara Porter will read the
A.S.S.U. vice-president, will speak.
Hymns and music will be under the
direction of Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist; D. Sterling Wheel
wright, assistant organist; and Herb
ert Jan Popper, associate professor
of music.
Following the Chapel Service,
freshmen may relax until 1:30, when
they will meet on Inner Quad for a
tour of the campus and a trip to the
top of the Hoover War Library.
The only other time students are
taken as a class to the top of the
Hoover War Libe is at commence
ment when the graduating class
makes this tour as a part of Senior
Week activities.

1945.
The Endâ€”and Beginning
It is on Reg Day that real Stan
ford life begins. Endless queues I

from in front of every window in
the Ad Building. Noise and con
fusion reign as happy Stanford men
and women renew old friendships
and compare summer vacations.
Quad salesmen are everywhere with
their never-ending question: "Wanna
'buy a Quad?"
But don't let it get you down,
freshmen. The pre-reg committee
has again come to your rescue. If
you have a problem, take it to the
Information Desk which the com
mittee is placing in front of the Ad
Building just for you. And good
luck!
