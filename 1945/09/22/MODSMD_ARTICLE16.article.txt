# Farm Spiritâ€”We Can Take It With Us
## 
### BETH MACVICAR 
Stanford spirit, with 54 years on
Quad as a background, is the atmo
sphere of friendship, ideals, and tra
ditions, that packs every avenue and
every classroom on campus, that re
turns with students to the dorms,
and travels with them to the student
rallies, to the Cellar, and to any place
in which Stanford students assemble.
It is each detail of work and play on
the Farm, and yet, in a sense, it is
apart from them. The Stanford spirit
is an abstraction, something the stu
dent may carry with him wherever
he goes.
Everybody Does
The spirit is ingrained in the tradi
tions of life in which all students
participate. Traditions like avoiding
the Law steps, lest the law students
clap you down in traditional fashion;
saying '"hello" to other Stanford men
and women on Quad and in the liv
ing groups; and waiting for a ride
with the traditional "I'm in an awful
hurry to get to Paly" look under the
Big Oak, opposite History corner;
and not smoking on Quad because a
long time ago Mrs. Stanford re
quested students not to.
The "Hello" tradition was intro
duced to augment the spirit of
friendship among students and has
been perpetuated in spite of the ex
pansion of the University commu
nity to a point where students ex
change hollos not on a basis of ac
quaintanceship, but rather as an ex
pression of congeniality.
How Smart?
Among the other customs cast be
coming a part of Farm traditions is
the Bawlout, and its numerical com
putations of grade averages. Stu
dents reveal academic abilities in
Bawlout averages.
Synomymous with Stanford spirt

is the Axe, forged in 1899, to sym
bolize the famous Axe yell. Stolen
by Cal rooters during an annual
baseball game, the Axe resided in
the vaults of a Berkeley bank for 30
years, but was eventually recovered
by the Immortal Twenty-one from
Sequoia, in the guise of newspaper
photographers using tear gas bombs.
Seen today in the showcase of the
Cellar, the Axe will remain until it
is offered once more as a trophy of
Big Game victory.

How Smart?
Among the other customs cast be
coming a part of Farm traditions is
the Bawlout, and its numerical com

Bawlout averages.
Synomymous with Stanford spirt

is the Axe, forged in 1899, to sym
bolize the famous Axe yell. Stolen
by Cal rooters during an annual
baseball game, the Axe resided in
the vaults of a Berkeley bank for 30
years, but was eventually recovered
by the Immortal Twenty-one from
Sequoia, in the guise of newspaper
photographers using tear gas bombs.
Seen today in the showcase of the
Cellar, the Axe will remain until it
is offered once more as a trophy of
Big Game victory.
