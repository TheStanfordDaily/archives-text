All incoming students—freshmen,
NROTCs and transfers—are invited
to sing in the annual Freshman Choir
at Chapel service tomorrow at 11 a.

After a brief rehearsal in the
Choir gallery at 10 a. m. tomorrow,
the choir will sing in harmony an
arrangement of the American spir

spirited anthem "Immortal, Invis

"Judging from last year's enthus
iasm for the Freshman Choir, we
expect between 100 and 125 new
students to fill the gallery," Dr.
Warren D. Allen, music professor
and director of the Freshman Choir,
said today.
Students who are interested in
joining the regular University Choir
will have an opportunity for inter
views next week, concludcd Dr.
