# "ONCE AGAIN THE CARDINAL ..."
## 
### 
Way back in June 1945, when the war was an uncomfortable
rnd for many a tragic reality, we were thinking of how we would
welcome the Class of '49 to Stanford. We had an idea even then
that those freshmen would take a large part in the planning and
preparation for a postwar Stanford, but no one saw you then as
Ihe first peacetime freshman class in four years, and no one
knew then that in addition to welcoming you and 200 members
of the Navy's Reserve Officers' Training Corps we would be
saying hello and welcome back to hundreds of veterans—
many more than the Administration or the Associated Students
could plan or hope for back in June 1945.
Two months later wonderful, incredible victory over Japan
brought Stanford face to face with the needs and problems of
jeturning servicemen, and gave this freshman class now par
ticipating in a pre-registration program the chance for four
peacetime university years.
We don't have to tell you to have fun at Stanford—to work
for the return of athletics, rallies, large-scale dances. We don't
v/orry either that you will disregard University traditions or fail
to take part in student government and activities. That part of
Stanford is too obvious and too valuable to neglect. We do hope,
however, that freshmen will remember that Stanford in three
years of war lost much in fluff and glitter, but found deep worth
in simpler living and playing and in study that acguired pur
pose. In three years of war we have come to know the Stanford
that had always been here but had been passed by in haste or
indifference: a hike in the hills, finding a friend where you
wouldn't have looked, probing deeper into a subject or talking
to a professor after class, worrying about the housing problem
oi the neglect of a tradition—those and a hundred more experi
ences are worth remembering.
Good or bad, college life can never go "back to normal." No
university in a country whose people could build an army, fight
a war, drop an atomic bomb, can march back to the "good old
days."
That's why we mean it when we say Stanford needs your
ideas, plans, and vision; that's why we want you to learn to
know Stanford and help to preserve everything of value you
find here.
