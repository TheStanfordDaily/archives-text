# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
As Pre-Reg Committee members and Frosh sponsors cannot
prepare individual '49ers to meet every Farm problem, the
Daily—"not quite a mother, but deare.r than a friend to thee"—
prints one possible solution to a pressing Frosh problem—that
first letter home. Just check on the dotted line beside the state
ment which fits your own particular case, borrow a pair of
scissors from your roommate (a stiletto will do in a pinch;
"roomy" is sure to have one), clip out gently, fold either verti
cally or horizontally (here individual tastes differ and there is
no "Stanford Way" as yet), slip into envelope jobbed from
"roomy," seal, stamp, address, break seal and sign your name
which you neglected in your haste, reseal, plaster with a Stan
ford sticker and drop in any campus mail box (pickup guar
anteed within seven days, sometimes takes a week).

DEAR FOLKS,
I AM
writing to you today because from what I hear I will
probably not be in a fit position to do so after I take
the English "A" Test this afternoon (and with that
sentence structure we wonder too) —ed. note.)
now in the P.O. (Post Office) where I have spent the
last hour and forty minutes trying to work the com
bination to my box. Thanks ever so much for the
check which I am sure is in the letter I am trying to
unlock.
in my new room in (Roble) (Toyon). My roommate
just arrived —I'll greet (him) (her) after I finish this
letter. I'd do it now but (he) (she) is from L.A.
I ARRIVED
safely.
sober.
but am still waiting for my (trunk) (duffel bag). Are
you sure it has been sent?
MY ROOM
is supposed to overlook Roble garage 58. 111 know
better when the dust settles.
is right near the showers.
is near the Tunnel From Toyon to Branner. Stanford
isn't so bad after all.
mate isn't from L.A. after all. (He) (She) is a foreign
student from up north—Portland, I guess.
I WONDER
what they mean by "Quad clothes" to be worn to
the lolly-Up.
If I'll see the (Army) (Navy) (Women) students on
the campus tour today.
which is the East wing of Encina.
LIFE HERE
is a trap.
may be less complex by the time I'm a seventh
quarter Frosh.
js said to begin in the Western Civ Libe. Further
details will follow in Tny next letter .... next quarter.
