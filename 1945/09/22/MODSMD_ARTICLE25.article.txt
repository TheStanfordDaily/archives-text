# Officers Greet Student
## Captain Crombe Farm Navy Chief 
### 
The commanding officer of the
Stanford unit is Capt. Charles E.
Crombe, USN, and the executive
officer is Comdr. John L. Wilfong,
USN. Both men are graduates of
the U.S. Naval Academy, class of
1926, and have seen extensive sea
duty in the past four years.
Capt. Crombe's most recent as
signment prior to his Stanford tour
was that of aide and flag secretary
to Admiral Jonas Ingram, com
mander-in-chief of the Atlantic
fleet. Comdr. Wilfong recently ter
minated a tour as commanding offi
cer of the destroyer "Wedderburn,"
which took part in the landings on
Leyte, Linguayen Gulf, and Zam
boanga in the Philippines.
It is planned to give the men
training as nearly equivalent to that
given at Annapolis as possible. A
60-foot yacht has been procured for
the Stanford unit and soon will be
moored in the Palo Alto Yacht
Harbor. Four 25-foot whaleboats
will be used to teach elementary
sailing and boat handling to the
trainees. Arrangements now are be
ing made to place a boathouse at
the harbor to house the craft.
NROTC students also will visit
active men-of-war vessels in the
area from time to time for practical
experience and indoctrination. Cap
ping the nautical phase of their
training will be a one-month sum
mer cruise in the Pacific, similar to
that taken by Annapolis midship
men.
The men will have liberty on
weekends, from noon Saturday
through 8 p.m. Sunday. Holiday
liberty will normally be granted
from the last afternoon class the
day before the holiday to 8 p.m. of
the date so designated for expira
tion. All NROTC students are lim
ited by navy order to 30 days leave
per year.
The rate of pay for trainees is $50
per month, in addition to free tui
tion, books, room and board, and
medical care. After initial issue, the
men will be expected to replace
items of clothing out of their own
pay.
Other staff officers of the Stan
ford unit, in addition to Capt.
Crombe and Comdr. Wilfong, are:
Lt. Comdr. J. W. Hammer, gunnery
officer; Lt. R. L. Lokensgard, cur
riculum officer; Lt. R. S. Via. aide
to executive; Lt. W. H. Williams,
athletics officer; Lt. G. C. Wilson,
first lieutenant; Lt. H. C. Westling.
A medical officer and a dental offi
cer with the rank of full lieutenant
are provided for in the roster but
have not yet been assigned. The
complement calls for 13 petty offi
cers, ten of whom have arrived for
duty.

To all of you men and women who
are coming to Stanford for the first
time, I extend a warm welcome on
behalf of the University. All of us
here have a special greeting too for
those of you who have so magnifi
cently served our country in the
military services, to the new men in
the Army programs and to the men
of the NROTC. We are glad to have
you with us.
Although the effects of war are
felt daily by every one of us, we are
deeply grateful that you are coming
to us in a time of peace. For the
first time in four years your fore
most thoughts are not directed to
ward strengthening our country's
war program and yet your present
obligation is none the less great to
prepare yourselves to serve the best
interests of our country and of all
mankind.
In the words of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford the object of the University
is "to qualify its students for per
sonal success, and direct usefulness
in life" and its purpose is "to pro
mote the public welfare by exercis
ing an influence in behalf of humani
ty and civilization."
We have at Stanford a staff of out
standing scholars and teachers who
are here to help you obtain the
training that will enable you to meet
fully the responsibilities that will
confront you in a world working for
peace. We feel sure that you will
justify the confidence we have in
you and that you will make the
most of your opporunities here.
On the lighter side, Stanford offers
many facilities for relaxation and
enjoyment. Make use of them, too.
They will help you achieve the
goals you seek. ».
All of us are here to work with
you and we are happy to welcome
you to Stanford University.
DONALD B. TRESIDDER
President

Registration Day again—and a
warm welcome to old and new stu
dents, civilian and military. Today
with the surrender in both Europe
and the Pacific we are at liberty
to plan ahead for Stanford's future.
No longer do we have to put our
emphasis first on the needs of the
war.
In making these new plans for all
sides of campus life we must try to
understand the many problems we
face, must be willing to think fresh
ly and adventurously to find their
solutions, and to cooperate fully with
one another. Knowing Stanford stu
dents I am confident of their desire
to be of the most service possible
to the University.
May each of you find your place
in this friendly community and gain
much from your experiences here.
Count on the members of the faculty
and administration for help when
you wish, for willing counsel when
you ask for it, and for generous in
terest in your welfare always.
MARY YOST
Dean of Women.

To the new members of the Stan
ford student body I extend a friend
ly welcome. As a new member of
the University, I feel especially close
to this freshman group. Together
we shall learn those things which
every freshman must learn. We
shall both make mistakes, but we
shall profit from our errors.
The task of reconversion from
war to peace is not an easy one for
the world or the nation. Even uni
versities are now faced with many
unusual problems. But the recon
version period is an interesting one
and affords an opportunity for learn
ing not commonly available.
From Stanford you can learn a
great deal. I know you will adjust
rapidly and enjoy the pleasant col
lege life offered here while you are
learning. The Dean of Students
exists to help you adjust to the
University life and to profit from it.
Please make every use of us.
JOHN M. STALNAKER
Dean of Students
