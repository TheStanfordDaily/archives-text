A student body card signifies your
entrance into a democratic commu
nity, your membership in the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Univer
sity. It means that you are attend
ing a university where student gov
ernment is a living tradition, and
where campus leaders are elected to
their offices by the students.
The ASSU Constitution which pro
vides the framework of this self
government, is the guide-line for all
campus activities.
President of the ASSU, assuming
office this quarter is Robert Ken
nedy, assisted by Charmian Kolar,
vice-president.
What Excom Is
Executive Committee (Excom)
holds ail legislative and executive
powers of the Association. The pres
ident and vice-president are elected
by the student body at large while

elected by and represent the various
living group areas on campus.
Student control is vested in Men's
and Women's Councils, each made up
of five members. According to the
Constitution, the two councils have
"such jurisdiction over all cases of a
disciplinary nature pertaining to the
student body of Stanford University
which is granted to the student gov
ernment by the President of the Uni
versity and shall have all jurisdiction
to enforce all regulations of student
body activities and student conduct
as enacted by the Executive Commit

tution."
