### 
When you're lonely or sad or look
ing for Christmas gift or just buying
a text book the Stanford Bookstore
has what you want.
The book selection ranges from
"An Outline of Philosophy" to
'Suds in Your Eye" with every
Louella O. Parsons and Stuart Chase
masterpiece listed in between.
Stationery Too
Then all the Stanford sta
tionery you've been wanting to
write your friends on, and all those
little Indian stickers you've been
wanting to plaster on home and car.
There are fascinating 49 cent bar
gains every week, and leather bind
ers, rubber erasers, and colored
pencils for the asking.
Take Your Time
It takes time to browse through
and enjoy the bookstore thoroughly,
and the day you buy your text
books isn't the time. Then the aisles
are crammed with people and you
can't see the little red stuffed ani
mals and the tables of books in
true perspective.
Go in some day and examine all
the latest best sellers, "Forever
Amber" and Webster's "Collegiate"
—you'll have difficulty keeping your
money in your wallet. And if you
don't read you can always send the
books home.
