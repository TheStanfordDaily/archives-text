## 
### 
Stanford's Union Cellar, tradi
tional gathering-place of Farm
students, must await offers of stu
dent help before it can stay open
longer than meal hours. Miss
Christine Kicker, director of Din
ing Halls and Stanford Union, an
nounced Wednesday.
At present the Cellar is open
from 7:30 to 10:30 during the
morning, 11:30 to 1:30 at noon, and
from 5:30 to 7 in the evening.
Restaurant help in this area is still
at a premium, Miss Kicker said,
and only with student hashers can
the Cellar return to full-time
service.
