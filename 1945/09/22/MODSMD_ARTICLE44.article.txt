# Cal Favored In Gael Game
## 
### 
Two games hold the football spot
light on the Pacific Coast this week
end as the nation starts its first
season of peacetime football since
1941.
At Berkeley the University of
California, under Buck Shaw for the
first time, tangles with its old enemy
St. Mary's, coached by Jimmy
Phelan. With little Hawaiian-born
Herman Wedemeyer playing for the
Gaels, Cal's new Bear eleven will
have its hands full to prevent St.
Mary's to run up its first victory
over the Bears since 1939.
Down at Los Angeles last night
the USC Trojans took on the UCLA
Bruins in a game that will go far
towards deciding the western Rose
Bowl team. Jeff Cravath has a
dangerous team at USC and pre
season reports give the Trojans an
inside on the Rose Bowl situation.
