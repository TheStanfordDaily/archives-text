At last the end is in sight for
Stanford's athletic famine. The In
dians will definitely return to Inter
collegiate sports with a basketball
etam winter quarter, carrying out a
full track, baseball, tennis and spring
sport schedule.
Football will return to the
campus Autumn quarter, 1946,
with Marchie Schwartz again at
the helm of the Indians. The last
football team the Farm produced
in 1942 took the Axe away from
California, 2(i-7, at Berkeley and
then came back to Palo Alto to
upset St. Mary's Pre-Flight, 28-13,
and wind up football for four
years.

Stanford and Montana are the only
two universities of the ten member
Pacific Coast Conference not play
ing football this fall. Idaho, Oregon
State ,Oregon U., and Washington
State have resumed athletics while
U.C.L.A., California, U.S.C., and
Washington played straight through
the war.
Santa Clara announced last
week that they would return to
football next fall so the Broncos
will undoubtedly be on the l!i4(i
Stanford grid schedule. Stanford
had signed a home-and-home pact
with Notre Dame starting in 1!)42
hut it is not known whether the
Irish will return to the Stanford
schedule. Dartmouth and Colub
bia were other Eastern schools
which frequently were on the
Stanford schedule but it will not
be known until the schedule is
made out sometime this Winter if
they will be on 1946 program.
Stanford's basketball schedule for
Winter Quarter will undoubtedly re
turn the Indians to the Southern
Division of the P.C.C with California,
U.S.C., and the Uclan Bruins. Be
fore the war St. Mary's, Loyola,
Arizona, Indiana, Utah, and other
eastern schools were normally on
the basketball sked. Scheduling of
these teams will depend upon trav
elling conditions though Stanford
will definitely not make an Eastern
swing this season as has been done
in previous years.
As yet Stanford had no track
coach due to the resignation of
Pitch Johnson. Everett Dean, In
dian Cage mentor is due to re
turn to the campus in Octobcr
when Marchic Schwartz is also due
back. Ilarry Wolters will probably
resume his baseball coaching next
Spring.
