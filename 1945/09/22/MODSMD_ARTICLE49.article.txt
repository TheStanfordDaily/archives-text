# Schwartz Returning to Farm
## To Lead First Team Since '42 
### 
The big news in the football situ
ation this fall is that Marchie
Schwartz is definitely returning to
the Stanford campus. The popular
coach turned out a bang-up team
when he took over the spot vacated
by Clark Shaughnessy for the 1942
season and by the end of the season
had what was called the "best"
team on the Pacific Coast.
Coach Schwartz is returning in
Octohcr and will conduct Spring
practice for the 1946 season.
Football prospects can be sized up
much better after registration
Monday. As yet no assistants to
the head coach have been ap
pointed but these appointments
will undoubtedly be forthcoming
after the Board of Athletic control
meets. This meeting, as yet un
scheduled, will probably take
place shortly after the start of
this quarter.
The 1942 Indian team, the first
coached by Mr. Schwartz and the
last eleven to wear Stanford's colors,
started out slowly losing on con
secutive Saturdays to Washington

State, Santa Clara, and Notre Dame.
Then, â€¢ in mid-October the Idaho
Vandals came to Palo Alto and the
Indians took on new form and wal
loped the visitoi's 54-7. Despite a
mid-season loss to the Rose Bowl
UCLA Bruins, the Indians beat
Washington, USC, Oregon State,
49-13, California, 26-7, and ended

the season by defeating the strong
St. Mary's Pre-fiight eleven, 28-13.
Coach Schwartz will occupy the
same position in Pacific Coast
football once occupied by the
famed "Pop" Warner, "Tiny"
Thornhill, who led the Indians to
three straight Rose Bowls, and
Clark Shaughnessy, the coach of
the year in 1940 when he led
Frankie Albert and Co. to an un
beaten Rose Bowl season.
