# Sequoia Hall Now Closed
## 
### 
Sequoia Hall is now in need of
substantial repairs, and as a result
there is some question as to what
appropriate use might be made of it
in the future. Pending clarification
of this study the building will be
closed.
During the war Sequoia Hall was
almost continuously in service either
as a barracks or training center.
Shortly after Pearl Harbor the Uni
versity made the structure available
to the War Department for the pur
pose of housing the Civilian De
fense Training School.
Subsequently the hall was occu
pied to capacity by soldier trainees,
and during this period it was im
possible, due to the heavy occupancy
and the unavailability of man power
and material, to maintain the struc
ture or to make appropriate repairs.
