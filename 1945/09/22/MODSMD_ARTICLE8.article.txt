# Navy Units To Register On Monday
## 200 NROTC Arrive At Farm; Group Will Live In Toyon 
### 
Two hundred blue-jackets in the
initial contingent assigned to the
Stanford Naval Reserve Officers
Training Unit have arrived from
receiving stations and moved into
Toyon Hall, former dormitory for
civilian men. The NROTC trainees
will register for the fall quarter on
September 24, at the same time as
Stanford civilian students.
The Stanford unit is one of 25 new
NROTC units which began opera
tions this month at various uni
versities and colleges throughout
the country. The NROTC program
recently was expanded from 7,200 to
24,000 men until one year after the
war and the permanent peace-time
quota raised to 14,000. The primary
purpose of the NROTC is to provide
a continuing source of junior officer
material for the regular navy. Stan
ford':; permanent peacetime quota
will be 300 men, with an annual
turnover of 100 as classes graduate.
Carefully Sclcetcd
The 200 men assigned to Stanford
were selected four months ago from
enlisted personnel on active duty
with the fleet, after intensive apti
tude tests and careful screening.
They are among the 1,500 men chosen
for entrance into the NROTC pro
gram from a field of some 6,000 ap
plicants. They are between the ages
of 17 and 23 and must remain un
married until the completion of then
training.
The NROTC men are housed in
Toyon Hall, which has been taken
over completely by the navy. Their
mess is in a special room at Encina
Commons.
Three-fourths Frosh
The men are classified as appren
tice seamen but will wear midship
men's uniforms as soon as they are
available. Some have already had
college work, while others are high
school graduates. Preliminary re
ports indicate that three-fourths of
the initial contingent at Stanford
will be freshmen.
The NROTC trainees are permitted
to major in any of the standard
fields of study offered by the Uni
versity and, in addition, will take
prescribed naval science and tactics
courses. Upon completion of the 11-
quarter program,, they will be com
missioned ensigns in the naval re
serve and also will be eligible for
a bachelor's degree from Stanford.
Stanford and the Honor Code are
so closely related that to name one
might be to name the other. The
Frosh Bible says that the Honor
Code is the expression of the Funda
mental Standard as applied to the
academic work at Stanford.
The Code is a contract between
the University and its students un
der which the students promise to
assume the responsibility of fair and
honest conduct for themselves and
others, and the univei'sity manifests
its trust in the students by refrain
ing from proctoring examinations,
or otherwise taking special steps to
prevent forms of dishonesty.
A Full Time Job
The Honor Code is not a system
that works only during examination
pcrir" l " r class time, or thesis writ
day by day constant elTort
rt of both students and
to cooperate fairly and
Standing.
\ Code, students do not
_v.iVe aid in examinations;
do not give or receive unpermitted
aid in class work, in the preparation
of reports, or in any other work
that is to be used for grading.
Library rules come under the
Honor Code interpretation, and
books may not be taken without
permission nor may any library
document be injured.
"Collective" Responsibility
Although the foremost responsi
bility of each student under the
Code is to conduct himself honor
ably, the third person or "collective"
responsibility, that of speaking to or
reporting offenders, was incorporated
in the Code to guarantee fairness
to the individual, and through its
operation to help other students find
within themselves the Honor Code
and its spirit.
Thus, if a student suspects an
other of violating the Code, the
suspected person should be spoken
to. If, to your knowledge, a violator
has not turned himself in to Coun
cil, your final step would be to re
port the offender's name to Council
where he will be asked to explain
his conduct.
It's Up To You
Should a student find that he has
—knowingly or otherwise—violated
any provision or application of the
Honor Code, he is expected to turn
himself in to the proper Council.

Stanford and the Honor Code are
so closely related that to name one
might be to name the other. The
Frosh Bible says that the Honor
Code is the expression of the Funda
mental Standard as applied to the
academic work at Stanford.
The Code is a contract between
the University and its students un
der which the students promise to
assume the responsibility of fair and
honest conduct for themselves and
others, and the univei'sity manifests
its trust in the students by refrain
ing from proctoring examinations,
or otherwise taking special steps to
prevent forms of dishonesty.

Stanford and the Honor Code are
so closely related that to name one
might be to name the other. The
Frosh Bible says that the Honor
Code is the expression of the Funda
mental Standard as applied to the
academic work at Stanford.
The Code is a contract between
the University and its students un
der which the students promise to
assume the responsibility of fair and
honest conduct for themselves and
others, and the univei'sity manifests
its trust in the students by refrain
ing from proctoring examinations,
or otherwise taking special steps to
prevent forms of dishonesty.

Library rules come under the
Honor Code interpretation, and
books may not be taken without
permission nor may any library
document be injured.
"Collective" Responsibility
Although the foremost responsi
bility of each student under the
Code is to conduct himself honor
ably, the third person or "collective"
responsibility, that of speaking to or
reporting offenders, was incorporated
in the Code to guarantee fairness
to the individual, and through its
operation to help other students find
within themselves the Honor Code
and its spirit.
Thus, if a student suspects an
other of violating the Code, the
suspected person should be spoken
to. If, to your knowledge, a violator
has not turned himself in to Coun
cil, your final step would be to re
port the offender's name to Council
where he will be asked to explain
his conduct.
It's Up To You
Should a student find that he has
—knowingly or otherwise—violated
any provision or application of the
Honor Code, he is expected to turn
himself in to the proper Council.
