# Navy Units To Register On Monday
## 200 NROTC Arrive At Farm; Group Will Live In Toyon 
### 
Two hundred blue-jackets in the
initial contingent assigned to the
Stanford Naval Reserve Officers
Training Unit have arrived from
receiving stations and moved into
Toyon Hall, former dormitory for
civilian men. The NROTC trainees
will register for the fall quarter on
September 24, at the same time as
Stanford civilian students.
The Stanford unit is one of 25 new
NROTC units which began opera
tions this month at various uni
versities and colleges throughout
the country. The NROTC program
recently was expanded from 7,200 to
24,000 men until one year after the
war and the permanent peace-time
quota raised to 14,000. The primary
purpose of the NROTC is to provide
a continuing source of junior officer
material for the regular navy. Stan
ford':; permanent peacetime quota
will be 300 men, with an annual
turnover of 100 as classes graduate.
Carefully Sclcetcd
The 200 men assigned to Stanford
were selected four months ago from
enlisted personnel on active duty
with the fleet, after intensive apti
tude tests and careful screening.
They are among the 1,500 men chosen
for entrance into the NROTC pro
gram from a field of some 6,000 ap
plicants. They are between the ages
of 17 and 23 and must remain un
married until the completion of then
training.
The NROTC men are housed in
Toyon Hall, which has been taken
over completely by the navy. Their
mess is in a special room at Encina
Commons.
Three-fourths Frosh
The men are classified as appren
tice seamen but will wear midship
men's uniforms as soon as they are
available. Some have already had
college work, while others are high
school graduates. Preliminary re
ports indicate that three-fourths of
the initial contingent at Stanford
will be freshmen.
The NROTC trainees are permitted
to major in any of the standard
fields of study offered by the Uni
versity and, in addition, will take
prescribed naval science and tactics
courses. Upon completion of the 11-
quarter program,, they will be com
missioned ensigns in the naval re
serve and also will be eligible for
a bachelor's degree from Stanford.
