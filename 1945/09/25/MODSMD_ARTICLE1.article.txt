# Let's Go, Indians--Kennedy

### Bob Kennedy 
Members of the Associated Stu
dents: I
Well, here's another fall quarter
and the start of a new school year.
What are you going to do about it?
As I see it one of our big tasks
this year is to rekindle the Stan
ford Spirit.
Do you want a football team this
year? We can have one if you want
it. When Coach Marchie Schwartz
issues his call for a turnout, let
every Stanford man respond.
Do you want good dances or just
mediocre get-togethers? Your Ex
Committee is ready to do any
thing you want them to do. Come
to us with your ideas and problems.
We are ready to serve you. You
elected usâ€”now use us!

You don't even know our yells.
Some of you have been here over a
year and still haven't learned the
words to our glorious hymn. It is
time Stanford woke up. Let's go!


BOB KENNEDY, A.S.S.U. president, sends a message to
Stanford students.
