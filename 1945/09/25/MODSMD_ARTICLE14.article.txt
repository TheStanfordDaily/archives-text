# Officials Work On Fraternity House Return
## 
### 
Speaking to Interfraternity Con
ference members at a meeting in
Palo _ Alto last Friday, President
Donald B. Tresidder and Financial
Vice-President Frank Fish Walker
stated that it is the hope of the
administration that plans may be
worked out to return houses for
fraternity use beginning fall quar
ter, 1946.
Dr. Tresidder said that it will be
the plan of the University to re
convert houses to fraternities as
soon as they may be released from
the University housing program.
At this time, however,, due to com
mitments under the Army and Navy
program, no definite date may be
set.
With enrollment already ex
ceeding housing facilities, the Uni
versity cannot release the houses
until they can be assured that ev
ery house will be filled.
A committee representing the 24
fraternties on campus has been
working with University officials
throughout the war. During the
reconversion period the committee
will make recommendations as to
the best means of returning the
houses to the fraternities, suggest
repairs and improvements to be
made, and consider and propose
various plans for some form of
University supervision in the
houses.
