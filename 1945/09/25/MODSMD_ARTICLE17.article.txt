# Reg Dance Set For Saturday
## 
### 
Plans are under way for the Reg
Dance Saturday, first big social
event of each quarter when new
students are initiated into Stanfor
diana, and old students stage their
prviate reunions.
% Traditionally sponsored by Car
dinals, the dance this year will have
as co-chairmen Milt Levy and J. D.
Williams. The Cardinals will meet
tonight to make plans for the dance
Saturday. So far it hasn't been de
termined whether it will be held in
the Women's Gym or the Pavilion,
ft has been tradition in former
years to hold the dance on Reg
night, but for the past few years
the dance has been held on the
first Saturday night.
Always informal in nature, the
dane this quarter will feature the
best reordings donated by students
on campus. Cokes will be the re
freshments for the evening.
Tickets are on sale at the A.S.S.U.
office.
Cardinals will hold their first
meeting of the quarter at 7:15
tonight when members will finish
making plans for the dance. Joan
McDonough is chairman of the
campus service organization.
Note: Newly announced ratio at
Stanford is 1.04 men to women!
Unusual post-war feature of the
dance will probably be a predomi
nance of men.


JOAN McDONOUGH, elected
president of Cardinals last spring,
who announces that the tradition
al Reg Dance will be held Saturday night.
