"BACK TO THE SHACK"
Two days on the Stanford campus spent dodgr
Ing automobiles, standing in reg lines, con
sulting officials, seeing trunks moved into ev
ery men's hall, calculating the ratio and watch
ing frosh men and women swarm through the
intricacies of the pre-reg program have con
vinced us that Stanford, if not back to pre-war
rosy days, is headed for a bouncing, brilliant
future. Those unconvinced should poke a head
into the Daily Shack to hear the clack of a brand
new United Press teletype, or watch harried
night editors respond to the print shop call for
copy as the "Peninsula's Only Morning News
paper" prepares for a regular eight-column edi
tion.
Once again 60-odd hard-working members
bf the Daily editorial staff, backed by just-as
hard-working biz staff members, are ready to
forget exams, give up qvening meals, pound
typewriters, and write impossible headlines to
cram all the news possible in four full pages.
Only by presenting all the facts can rumors and
false judgments be avoided.
Sound and skillful thinking is being directed
toward plans for the Stanford-of-the-future. The
Daily will try to bring those plans to its readers,
for only in knowing them can students grow
with a university.

NOT ONE BUT TWO

Bent low before a typewriter, we could only
pounce upon one recognizable thought yes
terday:
"Do Reg Days have to be like this?" _
In pre-war years registration continued
through two days. Freshmen and transfers
filled out their booklets on the first, returning
students on the second day.
The system, if readopted, would give Stan
ford men and women an opportunity to consider
their schedule with more care, and a chance
to discuss their program more thoroughly with
their advisers.
The advising committee has recently been
tevamped with an eye to offering students ad
vice from faculty members especially trained
concerning the University curricula; why not
give us the time we need for constructive,
thoughtful aid?
Returning students, Upper Division in par
ticular, want to discuss their major subjects,
independent work, and their post-college future
with the heads of the departments. Yesterday,
however, the professors who attempted to do
this job well were completely swamped. We
couldn't blame them if they gave up trying,
rather than live through another fiasco like
Reg Day, Sept. 24, '45.
It was a poor show, all right. And we didn't
even get a chance to shout hello at "Mr. Chips."

POOR CAL

Standing in the Lasuen-long lines in the Ad
building yesterday many of us had time for
thought. And many of us welcomed these mo
ments of inactivity for we were deeply moved.
We remembered Saturday and the Memorial
Stadium in Berkeley when, in the-third period,
in a last attempt to rouse their team from its
lethargy, the Bears borrowed our Axe Yell.
And we remembered that the yell worked. For
in the final quarter its echoes sent Edmonton
down the field 83 yards to a Cal touchdown.
For decades we Cardinals have been spurred
to touchdowns by our Axe Yell; for as many
decades we have been waiting patiently for the
Bears to recognize the magical powers of the
yell. At last our waiting has come to an end.
And we are deeply moved.
Of course, Cal's use of our cheer so late in
the Gaels' game was rushing the magical pow
ers of the Axe Yell. Had they come to their
senses at the end of the first or second period,
the score might not have been 20 over their 13.
But Cal is learning. And we are deeply moved.

AND THAT'S TIME FOR YOU

A long, theoretical gray hair protrudes grimly
one day, as the mirror shows you your sad
morning face. Suddenly, when you're still on
the grammar-school side of twenty, you figure
out that a|ll the rest of the guys in the world
seem to be getting younger and younger by
comparison with you, and that this must be a
process which will slowly swamp you the rest
of your life until you're one of the long-bearded
Old Ones—the ancient himself.
About nine or ten light years away along your

life-line, you can visualize commencement com
ing up, sluggishly, like a kid who hates like
heck to sweat out "The Bee" in a piano recital
but is being led in by the ear relentlessly by
Father Time.
At this point you're a senior and have a
couple of quarters left: scholastic quarters, and
the nice silvery kind they make at the Denver
mint. You can't decide whether to mangle them
into an 18-hour-a-day "Stanford Absorbing"
course, conscientiously trying to crowd in all
the classes, the characters, the activities, the
work that you've missed; or to let the whole
affair steam away without you.
But naturally, you try to pick up sticks. Re
member that old game in which you tried to
take as many sticks away from a pile as you
could without moving or upsetting the works?
That's the way you try and make up for the
hours wasted and already gone; you try to
take as much of school as you can. Finally,
you've caught a batch of technicolor memories,
sure .... but you've also got a nervous break
down.
Maybe you're not as distinctly on _ the way
out, as we. Maybe you still have the two or
three years left that it takes to make a brave,
though futile, attempt at getting all of what the
place has to offer, the plushy times which are
free to all comers. Maybe you'll be smooth and
smart and get your due of the look of the flat,
lands from the backyard hills, Bailey's Shake
speare, the things peculiar to the Daily, and
other —what's the old line?—"too numerous to
mention."
If you're one of the slickly organized num
bers who can drain the atmosphere in calmness,
nobody's worrying about you.
To the ones who are always hurrying, but
who find themselves in the wrong places at the
right times, we can give sympathy. And to
these members of our wooly-minded group,
we can just hand out a never-used warning:
The days shrink fast into minutes. There is
nothing for it, now, but to encompass all that
you can in every one of the illusive moments
that belong to Stanford.—N. S.
