### Cathryn Owen 
Life wur so gay in the laundry. Me and my
mangel had da big times. I poosh down on the
mangel, hold his top down till he good and
mad. Then I lift the mangel top justa liddle bit
—justa nuff to see liddle steams come out the
mouth. Then I jump way back and let the top
loose, and he steam and steam at me, and I just
laugh and laugh at him at behind the big
glasses on the Bendwix. Then he calm down
some more and I poosh some more.
Wall, one day while I poosh on my mangel,
there came a man witha lot talk, all wrap in
big red blanket. I don't like the way he not
wear the shoes, but it wur sharp that axe he
carry. He show to me the big sign and said
that I would be the "Adfroostration Building
Night Cuspodian," just like he read to me, if I
come with him. That's when I left the mangel.
They put me in the beeg empty room and
tell me I'ma boss. I wasn't know about this boss
bissness, though. It got a lot lonesome in my
beeg office, no Bendwix and no mangel. I
just poosh and poosh on the beeg red broom
and she never steam back at me.

When I wake up, I see the whole office full
with people, all one right after each other. I
stand up to look around myself, and I just get
poosh down a second once. I look around, and
I see that all the people in the room do the
same thing. They grab the people in front of
him and poosh him down. Then he jump over
him and do the same thing to the people in
front of him. By this time, though, the people
in front of him is up again once and poosh him
down. I heard of this football bisness, but I
think maybe I don't like it so well.
I look in one way and I see peoples all after
each other with all liddle white things on top
of the head. I look at them and see that they
are all men people and think maybe that some
body wur mad with them, because they all
wear the blue bib with the front to the back.

Then, all around these bad people I see
women people, all looking at the bad people
and pointing and talking like they wur count
ing the towels in the laundry. They point and
then they take out the paper and write liddle
numbers down, and then they say things about
"200 in Toyon" and "250 in Roble." Then they
open the mouth and poosh the teeth together,
and make more liddle numbers and marks. I
don't know much about this Toyon and Roble
bisness, but I wish that they aren't too bad with
those people in blue.

I wur sort of liking my place on the floor,
when all the pooshes started a next once. This
time the people all walk faster and fronter and
they just poosh me right along. This poosh
bisness not so bad too, but what they do next
maka me sad. They poosh me ina window that
says L-R, and a wooman pooshes me in the face
with a beeg rubber stamp with purple bisness
all over—and my name is Mahgie!

those people in blue.

I wur sort of liking my place on the floor,
when all the pooshes started a next once. This
time the people all walk faster and fronter and
they just poosh me right along. This poosh
bisness not so bad too, but what they do next
maka me sad. They poosh me ina window that
says L-R, and a wooman pooshes me in the face
with a beeg rubber stamp with purple bisness
all over—and my name is Mahgie!
Life wur so gay in the laundry. Me and my
mangel had da big times. I poosh down on the
mangel, hold his top down till he good and
mad. Then I lift the mangel top justa liddle bit
—justa nuff to see liddle steams come out the
mouth. Then I jump way back and let the top
loose, and he steam and steam at me, and I just
laugh and laugh at him at behind the big
glasses on the Bendwix. Then he calm down
some more and I poosh some more.
Wall, one day while I poosh on my mangel,
there came a man witha lot talk, all wrap in
big red blanket. I don't like the way he not
wear the shoes, but it wur sharp that axe he
carry. He show to me the big sign and said
that I would be the "Adfroostration Building
Night Cuspodian," just like he read to me, if I
come with him. That's when I left the mangel.
They put me in the beeg empty room and
tell me I'ma boss. I wasn't know about this boss
bissness, though. It got a lot lonesome in my
beeg office, no Bendwix and no mangel. I
just poosh and poosh on the beeg red broom
and she never steam back at me.

When I wake up, I see the whole office full
with people, all one right after each other. I
stand up to look around myself, and I just get
poosh down a second once. I look around, and
I see that all the people in the room do the
same thing. They grab the people in front of
him and poosh him down. Then he jump over
him and do the same thing to the people in
front of him. By this time, though, the people
in front of him is up again once and poosh him
down. I heard of this football bisness, but I
think maybe I don't like it so well.
I look in one way and I see peoples all after
each other with all liddle white things on top
of the head. I look at them and see that they
are all men people and think maybe that some
body wur mad with them, because they all
wear the blue bib with the front to the back.

Then, all around these bad people I see
women people, all looking at the bad people
and pointing and talking like they wur count
ing the towels in the laundry. They point and
then they take out the paper and write liddle
numbers down, and then they say things about
"200 in Toyon" and "250 in Roble." Then they
open the mouth and poosh the teeth together,
and make more liddle numbers and marks. I
don't know much about this Toyon and Roble
bisness, but I wish that they aren't too bad with
those people in blue.
