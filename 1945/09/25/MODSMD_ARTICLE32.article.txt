Settlement Efforts
Continue for Ford
DETROIT, Sept. 24. (UP).
While the United Automobile Work
ers proceeded with plans for an in
dustry-wide strike vote against the
automotive big three, settlement ap
peared nearer tonight in a month
long supply company tie-up halting
Ford production.
George W. Kennedy, president of
the Kelsey-Hayes Wheel Company,
where 4,500 workers have been idle
32 days because of a wildcat UAW
CIO walkout, wired UAW Chief R.
J. Thomas today that the company
was ready to negotiate a written
contract as soon as the strike ended.
Shortly before Kennedy acted,
Gov. Harry F. Kelly intervened in
the dispute which has shut off sup
plies to the huge Ford plants, forc
ing a layoff of some 40,000 Ford
workers. Kelly ordered Chairman
Phillip Weiss of the Michigan Labor
Board to examine the Kelsey-Hayes
dispute immediately.

The UAW, anxious to clear the
way for its drive to obtain a 30 per
cent hourly wage boost for its
600,000 members in the automotive
industry's major plants, also took a
hand. UAW Secretary George F.
Addes joined union leaders in meet
ing with Kelsey-Hayes officials
working to end the walkout.
California Workers
Ask Oil Strike Vote
LONG BEACH, Cal., Sept. 24.

oil workers already have signified
their desire to ask for a strike vote
in current oil-wage negotiations, C.
E. Frederick, secretary of Oil Work
ers International Union (CIO) Local
128, said tonight.
Frederick,'leaving for conciliation
dicsussions in Chicago, said he
would inform conciliators that work
ers in independent refineries and in
Wilshire, Union and Shell units
favor taking a strike vote "by a
big percentage."
"Ninety per cent of Shell workers
in California have rejected the com
pany's offer and asked that we pe
tition for a strike vote," he said.
Frederick will represent workers
in OWIU's California District 1 at
the Chicago session.
Lumber Yard Work
Halts in San Diego
SAN DIEGO, Sept. 24. —(UP)—
San Diego's first post-war industrial
work stoppage was reported tonight
in local lumber yards, with 70 work
ers out at the Sullivan Hardwood
Lumber Co., and the Western Lum
ber Co.
The strike was called by the AFL
Millmen's and Teamster's union after
several months' controversy with the
Lumbermen's Service Bureau over
the issue of a 7% cents an hour
increase :n wages.
Teamsters Refuse Aid
To Lumber Strikers
Intra-union friction flared in the
Pacific Northwest lumber strike
which has taken 60,000 AFL lumber
workers off their jobs. The Inter
national Teamsters' Union (AFL)
refused to cease hauling lumber
immediately because "we have a
contract."
Another 40,000 lumber workers,
members of the CIO International
Woodworkers of America, were im
patiently awaiting a strike call in
the Pacific Northwest. The strike
threatened new home construction.
