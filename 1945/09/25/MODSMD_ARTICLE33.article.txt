### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25. (UP).
—New atomic bombs already have
been developed that make a "small
firecracker" out of the one dropped
on Hiroshima, Rep. Leslie C. Arends,
R., 111., said today.
"I am advised on the most compe
tent authority that our scientists
and technicians have now created
atomic bombs of such prodigious and
multiplied destructive power that
the explosion which killed 150,000
humans and obliterated the city of
Hiroshima was only a small fire
cracker by comparison," he told
the House.

He introduced a bill proposing a
15-man commission, composed of
scientists and "other leading citi
zens" familiar with national defense,
to make recommendations to Con
gress on defense precautions from
atomic attacks.

He said he had information show
ing that American cities were the
"most dangerous spots" on earth
and that the nation must make far
reaching changes to decentralize its
industry and population as a pro
tective measure.

Earlier, Sen. Sheridan Downey,
D., Calif., called for international
control of atomic bomb secrets as
the White House disclosed that
President Truman expects to send
to Congress "fairly soon" his recom
mendations on development and
control of atomic energy.
