LONDON, Sept. 24.—(UP).—Am
erican sources were confident today
that the Big Five Foreign Ministers
Council could "dispose" of its major
problems and adjourn not later than
Thursday, despite the latest hitch
resulting from Soviet opposition to
the U.S. proposal to internationalize
European inland waterways.
By "dispose" the sources mani
festly did not mean "solve." It is
expected that most of the trouble
some questions which have plagued
the discussions, such as the Balkan
peace treaties, will be referred to
deputies with only the broadest gen
eral instructions. The deputies will
study the problem and submit re
ports to the council at its next
meeting in November.
A communique issued at the close
of today's sessions announced that
"the questions discussed by the
council were a long-term supply
arrangement for Austria, the pro
posal for an emergency regime for
European inland waterways, and ac
celeration of repatriation of Soviet
Nationals."

In view of the gloom which has
blanketed London because of the
slow progress, it is believed the con
ferees will make extra efforts to
achieve some semblance of general
agreement on most subjects, if only
to convince the people of their re
spective countries that time has not
been wasted.

But no final solutions on peace
treaties, frontier disputes or colonies
can be looked for.
