SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 24 (UP).
—Navy personnel of a Japan-bound
unit who are eligible for discharge
Oct. 1 asserted tonight that they
were being "shanghaied," the San
Francisco News reported.
Between 30 and 40 members of
the alerted unit that is awaiting em
barkation orders in the "bullpen"
at the San Bruno personnel depot
are known to have sent telegrams
to their congressmen, protesting the
orders, the News said.
The report stated that many men
were over 30 years of age and had
three or more children. The sailors
held little hope that their shipping
orders would be amended because
their gear already had been loaded
aboard a transport.
