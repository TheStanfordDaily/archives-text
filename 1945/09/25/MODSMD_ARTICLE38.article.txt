# Choir Tryouts Start Today
## 
### 
Overwhelmed by the largest turn
out of freshmen voices in the history
of the Farm*for the chapel services
last Sunday, Dr. Warren D. Allen
will hold individual tryouts in prep
aration for the rehearsal of the reg
ular choir 7 p. m. Thursday night
from 1 to 4 p. m. today, Wednesday
and Thursday.
More students are hourly apply
ing to augment the seventy-six
voices that Dr. Allen termed "the
best yet." Although there will prob
ably be more â€¢ applications than
vacancies, every interested Stan
fordite will be heard individually
by Dr. Allen and Dr. D. Sterling
Wheelwright. Those singers who are
accepted will receive one unit of
credit for their work during the
quarter.
Qualifications for membership, as
announced by the two choir heads,
include a fair voice, an accurate
ear, and dependability.
At the same time, Dr. Allen an
nounced that there will be a re
hearsal of the band and orchestra
at the Art Gallery Thursday night.
