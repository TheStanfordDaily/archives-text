# Sequoia Closed For Repairs
## 
### 
Until it is decided what the future
use of Sequoia Hall will be, the
building will be shuttered. In need
of an almost complete overhauling
because of its almost continuous use
as a barracks or training center dur
ing the year, the building will re
main closed until the question is
answered.

Due to the heavy occupancy and
unavailability of manpower and ma
terial, it was impossible to maintain
the structure or make appropriate
repairs during the emergency.
