SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 24 (UP).
—Eighty worn but happy men—a
hand-picked, symbolic unit of the
badgered Americans who once un
ashamedly called themselves the
"battling bastards of Bataan,"
winged homeward aross the Pa
cific tonight to receive the plaudit's
of an appreciative nation.
Their wives, mothers, sisters and
sweethearts gathered joyfully in the
San Francisco area to await the ar
rival tomorrow morning of three
Army C-54's and their reunions
with the men who trudged the pain
ful miles of the Bataan death march.

The men, all recently liberated
from Japanese prison camps, were
hand-picked by Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur and Adm. Chester W. Nim
itz as typical of the Americans held
prisoners for more than three years;.
Every man fought on Corregidor
and later endured the infamous
death march.

Tomorrow they will march again
—but this time down Market Street
riding in Army command cars—to
receive the ovation of the city from
which they sailed nearly four years
ago to bulwark American forces
against impending Japanese aggres
sion.
