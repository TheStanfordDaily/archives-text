Stanford, for the last time, must go through a footballess-autumn quarter.
For football-starved Stanfordites, the next best thing to do is to hop into
S. F. for Cal games. This Saturday they play the Rose Bowl-bound Trojans
of U.S.C., the team that dumped U.C.L.A. in their initial contest last Fri
day night under the arcs in Los Angeles. Eert La Brucherie's boys played

nriiiiantiy in tne nrst nan, out in tne
second half their offensive power
fizzled out like an Alka Seltzer tab
let in a glass of water.
Sports Return
Basketball practice gets under
way in October with Everett Dean
at the helm of the squad. Dean
returns to the Farm next week after
an Army-sponsored basketball jaunt
in Europe. Available casaba talent
is an unknown quantity, and un
doubtedly the Indians will be shoved
around quite a bit from other out
fits that have been playing through
out of the war, but regardless of
the showings made, it will be mighty
good to see Encina gym once again
packed to the rafters.
After basketball, baseball is the
next sport on the docket. Harry
Wolter, who has been handling
Stanford nine's for the past twen
ty years, has announced that base
ball practice starts in January. Once
again, no prediction can be made
on how the team will fare in col
legiate competition. Never a strong
baseball contender, we hope that
the reverse will be true in the post
war era at the sunken diamond.
Track, another spring sport, will
also return to the athletic ledger
this school year. No coach has been
hired for the spot, but an announce
ment is forthcoming in the near
future.
Good News
And don't forget, kiddies, the
bangtails start runnin' at Bay
Meadows on October 23. Three-to
five Jones, a leader without peer in
the Horse and Handbook set, in
forms us that a lot of good eastern
horses are going to be shipped out
to Bay Meadows, and that if we
want to make lots and lots of money,
we ought to take a 2-5 lab course
at Meadows every afternoon.
Two good friends of ours went to
Del Mar on Getaway Day, and by
the time the eighth race slipped
around, the officials could only
muster five nags together for the
race. One friend bet on two horses,
and the other friend bet on two
other horses. Guess who won. That's
rightâ€”the fifth horse, which goes to
show that they should have saved
their money. Saved it for the Hol
lypark track.
Baseball Season Over
One of the most torrid baseball
races ever witnessed is drawing to
a close. In the American League
Washington and Detroit have been
having a neck-and-neck race.. The
Tigers, bolstered by the return of
H. Benjamin Greenberg and A1
Benton, look like the winners from
this spot. In the National circuit,
the Cubs have been maintaining a
lead, however precarious, through
out the season. The St. Louis outfit
has been nibbling at the lead for
some weeks but can't seem to over
take Charlie Grimm's nine. It looks
like Briggs Field and Wrigley Field
will be the sites for this year's
World Series.

Tomorrow's hot tip from the Rail
bird is April Moon at Hollypark.
Paid $94.70 last time out at Crosby's
pony palace.
