### 
EUGENE, Ore., Sept. 24.—(UP).
—The University of Oregon's foot
ball hopes looked brighter today
with the expected arrival this week
of Jake Leicht, one of the nation's
top backfield stars.
After playing on Oregon's fresh
man team in 1941, Leicht went into
the army and rose to the heights
on service teams. Last year he was
leading ground gainer for the strong
Randolph Field Flyers. And this
season he has already sparked the
Fourth Air Force to victory over
the mighty Second Air Force team.
Leicht is expected to be on hand
when Oregon opens against Uni
versity of Washington in Seattle
Saturday.
