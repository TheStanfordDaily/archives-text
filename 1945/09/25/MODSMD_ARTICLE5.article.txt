# Housing Proves Vets Foremost Problem
## Robert S. Raven Is Administrator 
### 
A new group of Stanford students,
their reg books stamped "GI Bill of
Rights", climbed the marble stairs of
the administration building yester
day to consult the man whom the
veterans' administration has sent to
Stanford to assist veterans eligible
for benefits under the newly-initi
ated Bill. Mr. Robert S. Raven, Sr.,
whose office is located within the
public exercises department, was
answering questions concerning the
provision for payment of tuition and
supplies, eligibility of men as yet
unauthorized officially, and the cred
its they will be granted as a result
of in-service training.
Where To Live?

Foremost problem in the minds of
these new students was the lack of
any housing, for married veterans.
The university has never had ac
commodations for married students,
and Veterans are signing an already
substantial request list for rooms
and apartments in the vicinity.
An unofficial estimate by Mr.
Raven raises last spring's total of
141 veterans into the three hund
reds. Veterans are divided into two
categories; disabled veterans look to
Mr. Raven for supervision as to the
type of courses they can success
fully take, and for informal health
check-ups from time to time.
One woman, Stanford's first, re
ceived the GI benefit at the veterans'
window yesterday morning.
Academic Provisions

Six units are given gratis to those
veterans who can show six months
of service on their discharge certi
ficates. If these men are able to
give full information concerning
length, content, and grade for each
course of training taken while in
service, and a certificate from the
place at which it was given, the
University will evaluate and grant
credit for each. Each university has
made its own arrangement, inde
pendent of the Veterans Adminis
tration, for granting such credit to
students, under the Bill.
Veterans interviewed on the main
floor of the Administration Build
ing, were anxious to hear if the
rumored plans for comprehensive
tests to determine credit in certain
courses will be carried out. Initi
ation of such a plan lies at present
with the registrar's office and its
decision.

Veterans receive no other special
consideration in academic fields.
Those who were unable to qualify
under the aptitude test of college
entrance examination were not, and

will not in the future be admitted
to Stanford.
Just Plain Civilians
From the veterans themselves has
come the decision not to formally
organize. The majority wish seems
to be residence and participation in
classroom and extra-curricular ac
tivities with other civilian students.
Men whose papers of authoriza
tion have not as yet come through
and men on terminal leave are be
ing granted deferment on all pay
ments to the University if they are
able to prove that the necessary au
thority will be granted "soon," ac
cording to Mr. Raven.
Mr. Raven has been on campus
since last November, making calls
or temporarily located in the Dean
of Men's office. His advice to the
student body is to remember that
these men desire no special atten
tions, but an equal opportunity to
participate in University activities.
