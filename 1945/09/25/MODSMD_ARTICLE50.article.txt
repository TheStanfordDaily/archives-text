# Gaels Win; Bears Steal Our Axe Yell
## 
### 
Spurred on by the small but loud
St. Mary's rooting section scream
ing "the C is red," the Galloping
Gaels from Moraga spoiled Uni
versity of California's 1945 football
debut by upsetting the Bears, 20-
13, Saturday before 80,000.
The close score doesn't tell the
story of how completely Jimmy
Phelans' underdog Gaels outclassed,
outpassed and outran the heavier
Bears, making their first appearance
under Buck Shaw.
Cal Had Breaks
Twice the Moragans had touch
downs called back and a third long
gain play that would have put the
Gaels in scoring position was nulli
fied by the officials. California on
the other hand had all the breaks
but still were not able to take ad
vantage of them.
The crowd, the largest in the Bay
Area since Big Game days, thrilled
to the precision of the St. Mary's
passing attack. Little Hawaiian
born Herman Wedemeyer, more sen
sational than he was when he elec
trified 1943 crowds, passed the
Bears dizzy. Only once did he have
one of his passes intercepted and
fourteen times out of twenty his
passes hit the mark. Looking like
Frankie Albert on one of his better
days, little Herman passed 46 yards
to Paul Crowe for the first Gael
touchdown, ran 11 yards for the sec
ond score, and passed to Dennis
O'Connor on a beautiful reverse
plays that went 67 yards for the
third touchdown.
Edmonston 'Best Bear'
California scored first in the op
ening quarter with Bob Edmonston,
the best Bear on the field Saturday,
plowing over from the four yard
line. The other California score came
late in the final quarter when Bob
Powell connected with this same
amazing Edmonston for 83 yards and
a touchdown. But between these
two Bear scores the immense crowd
saw St. Mary's produce the most
amazing aerial display and dizzy re
verses since the Stanford 'T' swept
the Pacific Coast in 1940.
During the third period of the
game the enormous California roOt
ing section tried to wake up their
team out of their lethargy by giving
the Stanford Axe yell. It was odd
to hear the Axe yell echoing in
Memorial Stadium again and even
more odd to hear it being delivered
by the Bear rooters.
Just as odd were the red and
white uniforms of the Gaels, identic
ally the same as those worn by the
Stanford team during their last three
seasons of football. For a school
with colors of red and blue, St.
Mary's surprised the fans by coming
out decked in white helmets and
trousers and red jerseys. The feel
ing of seeing the red and white
romp all over the Berkeley Bear
was good, though.

passing attack. Little Hawaiian
born Herman Wedemeyer, more sen
sational than he was when he elec
trified 1943 crowds, passed the
Bears dizzy. Only once did he have
one of his passes intercepted and
fourteen times out of twenty his
passes hit the mark. Looking like
Frankie Albert on one of his better
days, little Herman passed 46 yards
to Paul Crowe for the first Gael
touchdown, ran 11 yards for the sec
ond score, and passed to Dennis
O'Connor on a beautiful reverse
plays that went 67 yards for the
third touchdown.
Edmonston 'Best Bear'
California scored first in the op
ening quarter with Bob Edmonston,
the best Bear on the field Saturday,
plowing over from the four yard
line. The other California score came
late in the final quarter when Bob
Powell connected with this same
amazing Edmonston for 83 yards and
a touchdown. But between these
two Bear scores the immense crowd
saw St. Mary's produce the most
amazing aerial display and dizzy re
verses since the Stanford 'T' swept
the Pacific Coast in 1940.
During the third period of the
game the enormous California roOt
ing section tried to wake up their
team out of their lethargy by giving
the Stanford Axe yell. It was odd
to hear the Axe yell echoing in
Memorial Stadium again and even
more odd to hear it being delivered
by the Bear rooters.
Just as odd were the red and
white uniforms of the Gaels, identic
ally the same as those worn by the
Stanford team during their last three
seasons of football. For a school
with colors of red and blue, St.
Mary's surprised the fans by coming
out decked in white helmets and
trousers and red jerseys. The feel
ing of seeing the red and white
romp all over the Berkeley Bear
was good, though.
Spurred on by the small but loud
St. Mary's rooting section scream
ing "the C is red," the Galloping
Gaels from Moraga spoiled Uni
versity of California's 1945 football
debut by upsetting the Bears, 20-
13, Saturday before 80,000.
The close score doesn't tell the
story of how completely Jimmy
Phelans' underdog Gaels outclassed,
outpassed and outran the heavier
Bears, making their first appearance
under Buck Shaw.
Cal Had Breaks
Twice the Moragans had touch
downs called back and a third long
gain play that would have put the
Gaels in scoring position was nulli
fied by the officials. California on
the other hand had all the breaks
but still were not able to take ad
vantage of them.
The crowd, the largest in the Bay
Area since Big Game days, thrilled
to the precision of the St. Mary's
passing attack. Little Hawaiian
born Herman Wedemeyer, more sen
sational than he was when he elec
trified 1943 crowds, passed the
