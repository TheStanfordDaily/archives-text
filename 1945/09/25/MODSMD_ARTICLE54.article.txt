### 
the Stanford team before last night,
four wins and four losses.
What Went Before
The Wedgewood nine, which top
ped the Phelps-Stanford outfit in
the last encounter between the two
teams despite the 24 strikeouts
racked up by Sher, featured the ef
forts of Tony Ornellas, their one
man-team. They had an eight win
and one loss record before game
time.
Next week, the Injun softballers
will take on the House of Lords
team. Bob Spillers, the second-place
aggregation's top hurler and one of
the ten best in the state let the

Stanford horsehiders down with two
hits in a previous clash.
