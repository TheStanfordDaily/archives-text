# Quads To Be Out By Midterm Week
## 
### 
Hold your breaths, folks! They're
coming .... and we do mean the
Quads. The latest word, and it is
official, is that the Stanford year
book will be out by mid-terms.
Jim Emerson has been appointed to
distribute them.
Students may present their stubs
on the distribution date. Those who
have lost theirs, may give their name
on the second day. Anyone inter
ested in distributing Quads may see
Jim Emerson or call him at 7490.
Emerson stated "In spit of the
fact that the Quad is late, it is still
very good. The University Press
did a good job."
