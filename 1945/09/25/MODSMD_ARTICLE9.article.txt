doomed to be forever a ghost until
he reforms a mortal from the evils
of the three great sins of life—
drink, gambling, and WOMEN.

angelhood, is so happy as a ghost
that he feels no urgent wish to reach
heaven until he discovers that his
kissing appeal to his daffy mortal
sweetheart is cold and uninspiring.
