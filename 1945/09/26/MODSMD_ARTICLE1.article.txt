Area representation, a method
new to Stanford student govern
ment, was approved last April in a
referendum to all members of the
ASSU. Direct election of student
representatives to Excom left no
guarantee that students would be
acquainted with the persons elected,
and did not provide a direct chain
of responsibility of each elected
member to the students who voted
him into office.
Consequently, student opinion
elected, 309 to 27 voted, to have
members of Excom be students that
lived in specific living-group areas,
so that each group would have its
spokesman, and a sympathetic per
son to whom its problems could be
presented.
Execs Control Activities
Through the student legislator so

elected pass all the business of the
student body—the problems, pro
posals and plans for activities. The
committee exercises control over a
large number of subsidiary organi
zations on the campus with its pow
ers of approval, recommendation
disbursement of ASSU funds, and
amendment of the constitution.
In addition to Kennedy, chairman
of the committee, and Chairman
Kolar, ASSU vice-president, there
are eight members from the living
group areas, and ex-officio members
representing Men's and Women's
Councils, Women's Conference, the
Stanford Daily, and the student
nanager.

Area representation, a method
new to Stanford student govern
ment, was approved last April in a
referendum to all members of the
ASSU. Direct election of student
representatives to Excom left no
guarantee that students would be
acquainted with the persons elected,
and did not provide a direct chain
of responsibility of each elected
member to the students who voted
him into office.
Consequently, student opinion
elected, 309 to 27 voted, to have
members of Excom be students that
lived in specific living-group areas,
so that each group would have its
spokesman, and a sympathetic per
son to whom its problems could be
presented.
