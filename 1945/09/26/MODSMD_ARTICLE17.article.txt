# Frosh Bibles To Infiltrate Upper Class
## 
### 
Freshmen Bibles, the traditional
handbook of new freshmen, have
been distributed throughout the
frosh residences and will now be
given to upper classmen. Cardinals
decided last night in their first meet
ing of the quarter.
Joan McDonough, president of
Stanford's honorary service organi
zation, suggested that the Bibles be
given to the older students from
booths in the Cellar, at the P.O.,
and on the Engineering Corner next
Wednesday. Charlie Clark will take
charge of the distribution with
Roble girls helping him.
Cardinals also passed a resolution
to remove the coke bar from the
Nitery, since, as Member Bob Ken
nedy said, "it had degenerated into
an enlarged spittoon." The Nightery
was originally built for a quiet place
to greet and visit with friends, but
since this quarter trouble has be
gun with enthusiastic and spontan
ous dances, loud radio playing, and
piano pounding.
Cigarettes, papers, and coke bot
tles have been thrown behind the
bar, iugs taken off the floor, and the
noise has been so bad that Union
cooks and bakers have been unable
to get to sleep in time for early
breakfast in the morning.
It was suggested that unless an
improvement was noticed the radio
would have to be removed from the
Nitery.
