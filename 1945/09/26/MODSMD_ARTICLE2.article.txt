# New Constitution Goes on Trial
## 
### 
Student government at Stanford,
functioning through the student
elected executive committee of the
student bar association, rules com
mittees, organizations, publications
and activities of students politically
as well as socially. It enforces its
rulings and policies through men
and women's councils. Only finan
cial advice comes to it directly from
the administration and its autonomy
and functions are singularly un
hampered compared to other United
States colleges.
This quarter the student body is
beginning operation under a new
constitution which makes major
changes in its previous constitution,
which was suspended during the
war.
In order that the aims and prin
ciples of this constitution may be
clear to those who wish to under
stand it and to know the organs of
student government available to
them and governing many of their
activities at Stanford, the Daily will
offer a series of articles considering
the new constitution and its major
changes section by section.
The constitution was drawn up
during the 1944-45 academic year
and adopted for trial-use by this
year's government, to be ratified by
student vote during this academic
year
The most vital change concerns
the representation of the executive
committee, which is now in effect
after last spring's election, and
changes the basis of representation
from class representatives to living
group representatives, on the
grounds that it is a more truly rep
resentative social unit of campus
life.
Changes in the honor code, organ
ization of councils and conferences
under the executive committee will
be considered in operation under the
new constitution and in their tradi
tional use. As students come into
only brief acquaintance with these
institutions, there is no great store
of information to draw upon in con
nection with the organs of student
government, therefore any contribu
tions to these articles will be con
sidered and appreciated by the
Daily.


Representation on the executive committee of the ASSU illustrated
above is one of the maior changes in student government under the new
constitution now in trial-use and due to come before an official student
vote this year; along with other new aspects of the constitution and
student government, it will be discussed in a series of articles to begin
in the Daily.
