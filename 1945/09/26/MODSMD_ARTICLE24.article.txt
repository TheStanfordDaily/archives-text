# Gaieties Tryouts Approach
## 
### 
Peacetime is bringing about swift
reconversion on the Farm this fall.
The pigskin won't be booted around
for another season and maybe thÂ«
big-name orchestras won't show up
for a few months but the spirit of
the campus is definitely on the
peacetime swing.
Here's one 01 the first chances
to join in the new spirit. The
Gaieties will splash the campus with
color on November 16 and 17, but
between now and then there arc
parts to be learned, tryouts to be
attended, dances to be worked out,
technical crews to be helped.
Tryouts for both stage parts and
technical crew positions will be on
October 1, 2, and 3 in the Memorial
Auditorium. All students with the
exception of first quarter freshmen
women are eligible to try out. Navy
men in particular are invited.
Tryouts will be on October 1
from 7 to 10 p. m. in the Little
Theater, on October 2 from 8:30 to
10 p. m. in the Memorial Auditorium,
and on October 3 from 7 to 10 p. m.
in the Auditorium.
Places are open for specialty num
bers such as original songs, music,
skits, song and dance teams, read
ings and pianologues; numerous act
ing parts; men's and women's
choruses and dances; and instru
mental work including orchestra
numbers.
Dance numbers will include tap,
waltz, folk, Spanish and specialty
numbers.
Both actors and technical crews
will receive points toward member
ship in Ram's Head, the honorary
dramatic organization, with those
working on the crews receiving
more points, however, than those
acting.
Lynn Shrader, technical crew di
rector, has appointed Marie Jo Mc-
Gervey associate technical director,
and Dick Williams assistant tech
nical director.
