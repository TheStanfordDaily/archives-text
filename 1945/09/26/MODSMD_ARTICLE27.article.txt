The influence one man may have on a constantly changing
group of students is often small when considered in terms of
depth or permanency, but once in a while a professor appears
who is so devoted to a course, so sincere and believing in what
he teaches that he and his thoughts are remembered throughout
o shifting campus and world scene. Dr. Rudolf Woldemar Hol
sti, Finnish diplomat and Stanford professor of political science
who died during the summer quarter, was such a man; and as
often happens, many of the events in his life which lent belief
end sincerity to his teachings were not generally known until
after his death. Many will never be known.
Dr. Holsti could be considered one of the founders of the
twentieth-century Finnish state. Through his successful appeal
to the Allies for food after World War I he saved his country
from starvation. He persuaded France and England to recognize
the infant Finnish government; then continued what proved to
be a life-long fight against fascism. He was elected to the Fin
nish parliament, served as Foreign Minister in six different
cabinets, was ambassador to Estonia and Latvia, minister to
Switzerland (1927-36, 1938-40), and permanent delegate to the
League of Nations—the last of the diplomats accredited to the
League to leave Geneva at the outbreak of World War 11. Gen
erally responsible for Finland's prompt payments of war debts,
Dr. Holsti fled to the United States when Nazis took over Finnish
affairs. Stanford was fortunate to have a man of Dr. Holsti's
knowledge and experience in the political science department,
and Stanford students are fortunate in knowing that Dr. Holsti
considered them his friends.
