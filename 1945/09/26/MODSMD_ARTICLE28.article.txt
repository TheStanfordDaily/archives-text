Small nations tend to sell their
sympathies to the side with the big
}.;< I:; army. This fact, unpleasant as
il is, might help explain the com
plex of politics in the Mediterran
ean.
Such nations as Austria. Czech
oslovakia, and their neighbors to
the south have oriented their poli
tics to the strongest nation, be
cause they see in that course the
best hope for their security. Thus,
most of them were pro-French
aftei the last war. The bonds
weakened at Munich, and collapsed
willi (he Maginot line. Now they
are swinging into Russia's orbit.
From the smaller nation's stand
point, the ideal arrangement is that
lh" bigger power will put up its
army in case the less pretentious
partner runs into trouble, and that
partner will otherwise have a free
hand to do whatever it pleased.
BIG NATIONS
The larger nation usually has
something to say about this, how
over, since it draws up the terms
of the contracts that found its
.sphere of influence.
Tl ie big country normally will
attempt to dictate its satellite's
foreign policy, and usually suc
ceed. It will also try to set up a
government completely docile in
its direction, and sometimes it
does, but usually it deals with
a regime whose only interest in
alliance is what the smaller state
can get out of it.
The big country will try to build
up its satellites, territorially and
strategically speaking, but, of course,
not to the point where they can
speak to it on equal terms.
RUSSIA AND BALKANS
This pattern seems to hold true
in the case of Russia and the Bal
kans. Russia, though, is carying it
somewhat.
Reports received from some of the
doubtful members have it that Rus
sia is going a little farther than
mo t big countries, and is trying to
control the economy of the states
as well as put in hand-picked re
gimes.
In one case. Austria, it is pro
ducing had results. She started
faking too much from the coun
try's small oil industry, and. as
a result, the Rentier government

i cold-bloodedly switched its sym
pathies to the Western powers.
The same result might eonie
about in Czechoslovakia if the
rumors are true that Russia in
tends to transform the Slovak half
into a Soviet Republic, if Czech
oslovakia can switch, considering
that the Russians now control the
the army.
Also, a recent article in Reader's
Digest by a correspondent just back
from Roumania claims that the
people of that country are a little
j sick of the high-handed measures
| used by the Russian administrators
' and the Communist party subsid
iaries.
COMMENTS
The key to this mechanism is
that Russia is giving the Tito gov
| eminent in Jugoslovia preferential
status in the Balkans, and this sug
| gests that she intends to make a
squeeze play with the Red Army
on one side and the Marshal on the
other, to keep the rest of the Balkans
in line. Also, it would allow Russia
to sap the rest of them for what
she needs most, material to recon
j struct.
Yet, in the long range view,
it is part of Russia's pattern for
peace. Stalin, although ruthless,
is realistic. He knows that indus
try built with peace and not ter
ritorial gain that threatens war is
in the best interest of both his
rule and his country's standing
in modern power politics. He
seems bent on getting this peace
by lining up enough buffer states
to make anybody think twice be
fore attacking him.
However, anybody will also tend
to think twice before co-operating
with him, and, although the other
major powers of Europe would not
ally to attack him, they might have
to defend themselves against him if
this policy continues and expands.
This could mean the figure of Eu
rope into suspicious armed camps,
awfully similar to those existing be
; "ore 1914.
Thus the policy is lamentable,
and especially from Russia's
standpoint, as it might sow the
seeds of new war. As a tool of
an ultra-realist for the gaining of
realistic ends, it might prove any
thing but realistic, as it could well
defeat its own purpose.

The key to this mechanism is
that Russia is giving the Tito gov

status in the Balkans, and this sug

to sap the rest of them for what

Yet, in the long range view,
it is part of Russia's pattern for

is realistic. He knows that indus

in the best interest of both his
rule and his country's standing
in modern power politics. He
seems bent on getting this peace
by lining up enough buffer states
to make anybody think twice be

However, anybody will also tend
to think twice before co-operating
with him, and, although the other
major powers of Europe would not
ally to attack him, they might have
to defend themselves against him if
this policy continues and expands.
This could mean the figure of Eu
rope into suspicious armed camps,
awfully similar to those existing be

Thus the policy is lamentable,
and especially from Russia's
standpoint, as it might sow the
seeds of new war. As a tool of
an ultra-realist for the gaining of
realistic ends, it might prove any
thing but realistic, as it could well
defeat its own purpose.
