# "Publish or Bust," Chappie Needs Help
## 
### 
A Chaparral staff depleted by
graduation and military demands is
sitting patiently in its far-fabled
office awaiting a fresh crop of car
toonists, technical workers and hu
mor writers to help them prepare
autumn quarter's rst Chappie mag
azine.
Official welcome will be given all
students interested in joining the
magazine staff tomorrow evening at
8, when veteran staff members will
introduce a period of tryouts be
fore selecting students for the many
positions that need filling.
Navy students, who have been of
ficially encouraged to take part in
extra-curricular activities, are ex
tended a particular invitation to
join the staff. If the first meeting is
scheduled for a time inconvenient
to Navy students, they are encour
aged to drop by the Chappie office
for individual interviews.
Located on the second floor of the
Press Building, next to the Daily
Shack and across from the Quad of
fices on Lomita Drive, the Chappie
offices are the fond property of the
many students who have worked
on the magazine since its beginning.
Its walls are papered with cartoons
clipped from other humor maga
zines, and painted with original
drawings by the Chappies of recent
years.
Next to the editorial office,
wherein resides the Old Boy and
his staff, is the office of the busi
ness manager, a position occupied
this year by Pat Pagen, president
of the Women's Auxiliary of Ham
mer and Coffin.
Hammer and Coffin is the national
humor society, founded at Stanford
on the eve of the 1906 earthquake,
which publishes the Chaparral. Al
though some chapters of this so
ciety in the West temporarily ab
dicated, and many campus maga
zines according to an informal rat
ing cut down the content and the
use of improved technical facilities
in their publications, Stanford con
tinued to publish with a rating as

high nationally as ever in pre-war
years.
Today, in the post-war era that
promises so much in the enlarge
ment of staff and technical facilities
of the University Press, the Chapar
ral is asking for many students who
are actively interested in magazine
publishing to help maintain its rep
utation of "publish or bust."
The students who are willing to
try out for, to contribute their en
ergies and talent to the Chaparral
will take a large part in formulat
ing the policies of the magazine.
With the photographic and color
equipment of the University Press,
the enthusiasm of student writers,
and a tradition of nearly fifty years
of publication, the Chaparral will
this year as always be an enjoyable
and important part of student ac
tivities, according to Miss Pagen.

magazine staff tomorrow evening at
8, when veteran staff members will
introduce a period of tryouts be
fore selecting students for the many
positions that need filling.
Navy students, who have been of
ficially encouraged to take part in
extra-curricular activities, are ex
tended a particular invitation to
join the staff. If the first meeting is
scheduled for a time inconvenient
to Navy students, they are encour
aged to drop by the Chappie office
for individual interviews.
Located on the second floor of the
Press Building, next to the Daily
Shack and across from the Quad of
fices on Lomita Drive, the Chappie
offices are the fond property of the
many students who have worked
on the magazine since its beginning.
Its walls are papered with cartoons
clipped from other humor maga
zines, and painted with original
drawings by the Chappies of recent
years.
Next to the editorial office,
wherein resides the Old Boy and
his staff, is the office of the busi
ness manager, a position occupied
this year by Pat Pagen, president
of the Women's Auxiliary of Ham
mer and Coffin.
Hammer and Coffin is the national
humor society, founded at Stanford
on the eve of the 1906 earthquake,
which publishes the Chaparral. Al
though some chapters of this so
ciety in the West temporarily ab
dicated, and many campus maga
zines according to an informal rat
ing cut down the content and the
use of improved technical facilities
in their publications, Stanford con
tinued to publish with a rating as

high nationally as ever in pre-war
years.
Today, in the post-war era that
promises so much in the enlarge
ment of staff and technical facilities
of the University Press, the Chapar
ral is asking for many students who
are actively interested in magazine
publishing to help maintain its rep
utation of "publish or bust."
The students who are willing to
try out for, to contribute their en
ergies and talent to the Chaparral
will take a large part in formulat
ing the policies of the magazine.
With the photographic and color
equipment of the University Press,
the enthusiasm of student writers,
and a tradition of nearly fifty years
of publication, the Chaparral will
this year as always be an enjoyable
and important part of student ac
tivities, according to Miss Pagen.
A Chaparral staff depleted by
graduation and military demands is
sitting patiently in its far-fabled
office awaiting a fresh crop of car
toonists, technical workers and hu
mor writers to help them prepare
autumn quarter's rst Chappie mag
azine.
Official welcome will be given all
students interested in joining the
magazine staff tomorrow evening at
8, when veteran staff members will
