SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25 (UP).
â€”All the glitter and pomp of a pre
war first-night opening was in evi
dence here tonight to hear Rise
Stevens sing the title role in the
ooera "Carmen" which ushered back
the gala opera premieres, complete
with evening gowns, white ties and
orchids.
The world-famed San Francisco
Opera House, scene of the United
Nations Conference, returned to its
esteemed place of high note and
fashion while playing host to an au
dience estimated at 4,500 persons.
Mixed with all the color of a
fashionable first night were a num
ber of uniforms, signifying that the
war still isn't over for many.
The standing room only sign was
posted early. The parade of city
and West Coast notables in their
costliest gowns and finest suits be
gan a full hour before the curtain
of Bizet's Spanish opera went up
at 8 p.m.
