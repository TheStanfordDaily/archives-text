SPOKANE, Wash., Sept. 25.—(UP)
—Five-hundred war veterans at
Baxter General Hospital today de
manded the impeachment of Sen.
Theodore G. Bilbo, D., Miss., for
"spreading and fostering racial and
religious discrimination."
The war veterans' committee for
equal rights wrote the senior sen
ator from Mississippi attacking him
for his "vehement denunciation of
various segments of the American
people" on the floor of congress.
The committee, organized last July
to protest discrimination against
Japanese-American war veterans by
a Spokane Veterans of Foreign Wars
post, was roused to action today by
Bilbo's widely-publicized statements
an dietters against what he called
"Dagoes" and "Kikes."
"We feel that you have disgraced
the halls of congress by spreading
and fostering racial and religious
discrimination," the letter said. "We
go on record with other organiza
tions in demanding your impeach
ment.''
The letter, signed by Saul Kessler,
recently discharged veteran and
new executive secretary of the com
mittee, scored "those, who under
the guise of Americanism, are do
ing everything in their power to
create chaos and disunity through
their favorite device of race baiting
—especially Negro, Red and labor
baiting."
