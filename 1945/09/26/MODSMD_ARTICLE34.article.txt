## MY KINGDOM FOR A HOUSE 
### 
With all the civilian and Navy
frosh registered as permanent resi
dents of the Western Civ Libe
and'or of the Independent Study
Room (for those students who enjoy
working alone without roommate's
kind help), a partial solution to the
Farm housing problem seems ob
vious. At least to those of you who
have successfully completed (D or
better) Professor Mcßrain's course
in "Thought and the Stanford co-
Red" it will seem elementary.
Adding the 200 in Toyon to Roble's
250, plus Ventura, Encina and Feb
ruray which has 28, available rooms
will total nearly 600. When trunks
and crates are finally cleared, addi
tional rooms may be discovered.
But the Civ Libe Solution to the
Housing is not the only
one. At 6:23 p.c.t. (Pete's Cellar
Time) this morning the usually sil
ent wire services typed out an
other Stanford solution to the prob
lem. Although the story was carried
by the UP lines, the DOWN service
with central sending set located in
the Daily sports office sent it first.
Oh yes, they did.
The plan, after it was deciph
ered offered a Peace-time Emer
gency program of night shift classes
for students. According to statis
tics presented by Stanford math
majors, the new sleep-study shift
plan will allow for seven and eight
in a single room whereas the fig
ures quoted by the housing board
rarely topped five.
In the long run, of course, the
administration must choose between
these two possible solutions—and
such a choice is difficult—but in the
short run with the demand curve
and Econ I majors swinging to the
right, something must be done with
the empty campus space NOW
available. By putting half of the
students "on days," half "on nights"
and the other half "on mealtime"
classroom schedules, we have a
temporary answer. Three times as
many students will have time to
doze over their books in the Main
Libe a£id over their Dailies in
classes. Previously wasted space
will be used 24 hours each day.
And sometimes longer.
(California colleges not on DOWN
service please copy.)
But, if even after studying these
infallible schemes, you are still
worrying about a place to live, why
not come home to Napa witih me?
