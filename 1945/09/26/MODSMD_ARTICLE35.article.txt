## NOT THE AXE 
### 
To the Editor:
Our hopes are not exactly running
wild but they are running to dreams
of seeing a Stanford team play foot
ball under Stanford colors this fall.
We were a little heated under the
collar (temperature, 100 deg C.—boil
ing point) after hearing of Cal's use
of our Axe Yell. Thai's practically
plagiarism.
Of course the axe yell didn't help
Cal. Only when roared from the
throats of Stanford Students can the
Axe Yell bring victory.
We want to yell. Come on Stan
ford men. Give us a Stanford team
to cheer for. Don't let the stadium
rust.
