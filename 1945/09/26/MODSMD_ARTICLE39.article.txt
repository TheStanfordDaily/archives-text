# Dodds To Read Poems
## 
### 
Dean John Dodds of the English
Department will read selected po
ems from the Victorian era Monday
afternoon at 4:15, to begin a series
of informal poetry readings with
interested students by members of
the department.
Professors in the English Depart
ment, recalling undergraduate days
in college and afternoons of pleas
ure reading poetry aloud with other
students or with professor friends,
decided to initiate a similar pro
gram at Stanford in hopes of pro
viding restful, thoughtful enter
tainment for students in all fields
of study.
Favorite Poems
Each of the professors has chosen
favorite poems or representative
poems from a favorite period in
literature; they hope to pass on to
their listeners the pleasure they
have found in these poems. Mon
day's reading, like those to follow,
will be held in the Briggs Room,
where students may relax in the
easy chairs there or sit on the floor
if preferred.
There will be no lecture on po
etry, no academic presentation of
the poems to be read. Students will
attend at their own pleasure, may
smoke if they would enjoy doing
so. Students may take this oppor
tunity to meet informally with pro
fessors. to become better acquainted
with them in the brief periods (45
minutes) they will meet.
Book Displays
Displays of books containing po
etry by the authors to be read each
week will be arranged in the main
library, and students may acquaint
themselves further with those poets
they particularly enjoy.
