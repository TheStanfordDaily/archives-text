LONDON, WEDNESDAY, Sept.
26.—(UP). —Soviet Foreign Com
missar V. M. Molotov, apparently
criticizing American policy in Ja
pan, yesterday urged the Council
of Foreign Ministers to place con
trol in the hands of a four-power
comniission, London newspapers re
ported today.
The Daily Herald said Molotov
pointed out that the United States,
Britain, Russia and China contrib
uted most to victory in the Far
East, and jointly should determine
Allied policy.
There was no suggestion that Aus
tralia, New Zealand, India or other
Allied nations participate.
Terming the request a surprise
move, the Daily Herald said Molo
tov asked that the question of Al
lied control in Japan be added to the
agenda of the present council.
The London Times said that the

British government also have sug
gestions to bring forward in this
matter.
Meanwhile the Soviet-supported
Hungarian government set Nov. 4
as a date for nationwide elections
and received a United States note
expressing willingness to establish
diplomatic relations, the Budapest
radio said yesterday. Observers re
garded the move as a possible break
in the Balkan treaty difficulties
which have beset the council.
