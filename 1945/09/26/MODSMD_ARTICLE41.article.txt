# Humanities Offers Japanese, Malay
## 
### 
As a part of the Pacific-Asiatic-
Russian program ofTered by the
School of Humanities, Stanford is
giving the first peace-time courses
| in the Japanese and Malaly lan
guages, announced the School of
Humanities.
In addition to these, Chinese and
Russian are, of course, being con
tinued. All these languages have a
great potential value in our future
relations with the Orient and Rus
sia. On the basis of its experience
with its Army courses in these lan
guages, Stanford is stressing conver
sational ability, especially in Malay,
more than was done heretofore.
