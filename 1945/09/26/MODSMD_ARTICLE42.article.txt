# Coast Ball In Play-offs
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
This week the four top teams in
the Pacific Coast baseball league
enter the Shaughnessy play-offs.
Players have always considered this
play-off a Machiavellian device to
keep them in baseball togs a couple
of extra weeks while the club own
ers managed to pocket a few extra
shillings. As a result of this dis
dainful attitude towafd
some of the games have been a
sore lot. Fans have lost their in
terest, which doesn't help the turn
stile collector any, so the club
bosses got together and decided to
abandon this post-season play after
this year.
Play-offs This Week
The first week of play pits the
Portland Beavers, who won the pen
nant in regular competition, against
ihe rejuvenated Sacramento nine,
the team that features the serv
ices of Jo-Jo White, the outfielder
of ex-Detroit fame. The other con
test is between Lefty O'Doul's Bay
Area boys and the Emil Sick crew
of Seattle.
Next year the caliber of baseball
will shoot up a few notches. The
oddest collection of misfits ever as
sembled donned baseball uniforms
this year and stumbled and fum
bled their way around the baseball
diamonds. Their performance got so
bad at times that people began to
think that a bunch of clowns were
trying to earn some extra moolah
during the slack circus season; pegs
aimed for first base ended up in
the dugout; backstops were never
hit so much with wild pitches; and
base running was simply atx-ocious.
Clubs have been hanging on to
every player for dear life, so much
has there existed a dearth of able
diamondeers. "C'est la guerre" is
no longer the word of the hour,
which means a release of baseball
players for the armed services, and
by the time the familiar strain of
"batter up" is heard next spring,
familiar names of old will once
again be patrolling their favorite
positions. Present performers who
made wartime promotions merely
because of existing conditions will
be shoved into leagues of lower
standing, where they rightly belong.
Post-war Boom
Baseball, which hit the financial
jackpot during the war, even with
incompetent material afield, is con
fident of even bigger gates next
season. The attendance at the foot
ball games in the Bay Area last
weekend is indicative of what sort
of boom sport will enjoy from now
on. This year's World Series which
will have a sprinkling of war re
turned players, will undoubtedly
break all records in gate returns.
Looking into the crystal bowl, we
see Ted Williams batting a high
.300, Joe Di Maggio swatting out
home runs with regularity; Feller
winning about 25 games; and Hank
Greenberg approaching Ruth's home
run record.
