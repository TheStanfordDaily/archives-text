CHICAGO. Sept. 25.-(UP).â€”The
league leading Cubs staved off an
eighth inning rally by the St. Louis
Cardinals today and whipped the
world champions, 6 to 5, practically
clinching the 1945 National League
pennant.
The Cubs' victory, before 21,138
chilled fans at Wrigley field, dropped
the Cards two and a half games be
hind with only five days left in the
season.
The Cubs, who have been hexed
by the Cardinals all season, won the
"big one" when it counted the most
and they did it by coming from
behind to knock out Harry Brech
een, the cunning Cardinal lefthand
er who had beaten them four prev
ious times this season.
Slender Hank Borowy, who had
nosed out the Cardinals two prev
ious times this campaign, was chased
to the showers in the eighth but re
ceived credit for the victory. It was
his 20th this season, counting 10
triumphs with the Yankees before
the Cubs purchased him.
The Cubs now need only three
victories in their remaining six
games to capture their first National
League flag since 1938, regardless
whether the Cardinals sweep their
remaining four gai#es including to
morrow's contest with the Cubs.
Although the Cubs were outhit,
14 to 9, the Bruins concentrated six
hits in the first and seventh innings
to push across all their runs. After
the Cardinals opened the game with
two runs in the first inning on four
singles and Stan Hack's error, the
league-leaders came back to tie it
up on a walk, singles by Don John
son and Hil Cavarretta and Brech
een's error.
Buster Adams' line single, George
Kurowski's sacrifice and Ray San
der's rifle single to center field gave
the Cardinals a run in the fifth for
a 3 to 2 lead. But then the Cubs
took a page out of the Carinal's
book, staging a seventh inning four
run comeback that stood up for the
victory.
Afver Roy Hughes singled and
was forced by Borowy, Hack walked
and Johnson singled to left for one
run. Peanuts Lowery was given an
intentional pass, filling the bases, and
Cavarretta pounded a single to cen
ter field to score Hack and chase
Brecheen. Relief Hurler George
Dockins was greeted by Andy Paf
ko's double, scoring Johnson and
Lowrey for the Big Four.
The Cardinals made an eleventh
hour bid in the eighth with singles
by Marion and Pinch-Hitter Augie
Bergamo plus Pinch-Hitter Debs
Garms' sizzling triple pushing across
two runs to send Borowy to the
bench. However Ray (Pappy) Prim
came in to retire the side and give
the Cubs the victory that is almost
certain to bring them the pennant.
