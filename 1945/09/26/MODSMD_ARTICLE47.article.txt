### BOB SLOBE 
Although Stanford has not yet
begun to feel fully the return to
peacetime sports, many other squads,
professional and otherwise, are be
ginning to feel the effects of the
"shot in the arm" that the end of
the war had given them.
This fact perhaps is evidenced
most prominently by the return of
former stars to uniform in profes
sional baseball.
Great hitters like Hank Green
berg and Charlie Keller have
proven their ability to maintain
the reputations they garnered for
themselves before the war. Both
of them came through with cir
cuit clouts their first day hack in
the lineup of their former teams,
the Detroit Tigers and the New
York Yankees. Greenberg came
hack iust in time to aid such
Bengal greats as Eddie Mayo,
Culltnbine, and Hal Newhouser,
second only to Bobby Feller, to win
the American league pennant. If
you will think back, Ilank is the
one who socked out fifty-eight
homers in 1940 to almost nip Babe
Ruth's all time high of sixty.
Speaking of Bobby Feller, it is
indeed probable that he will take
his place among the all time greats,
with such hurlers as Christy
Mat.hewson, Walter Johnson, and Cy
Young, after his blazing return to
the Cleveland )ineup.
Twice now, he has handcuffed the
pennant hungry Tigers, once with a
one hitter. In his first game he struck
out twelve Tiger batsmen—Hank
Greenberg iwice.
Another promising veteran is am
bidextrous Dave Ferriss of the Bos
ton Red Sox, a pitcher who looked
like the rookie of the year until
several recent setbacks, and he can
hit ioo.
Veterans will be given their
chance to prove that they can
stick in the big time after two or
three years of inactivity. Almost
all leagues have rulings stating
that veterans must be given a
thirty-day trial at the same salary
as they were receiving when they
entered the service. Many teams
such as the San Francisco Seals
and the New York Yankees will
have practically entire new nines
on the diamond next year. Di
Maggio, Keller, Rizzuto and Ilein
ricli will be back with the 'Yanks'
and Ferris Fain. Don White, Don
Trower, AI Lien. Harry Goorahian,
and Kermit Lewis, to mention a
few, will all be hack with (he
Seals next year.
We also can expect a huge post
war boom in the interest that fans
will take in sports. The attendance
record of a quarter of a million fans
for three football games in California
over the weekend probably set an
all time high for a trio of contests
in one state.—U.S.C.-U.C.L.A. drew
90.000. California-St. Mary's 80,000,
Fleet City-Second Air Force, 62,000.
With the return of Coaches Ever
ett Dean and Marchie Schwartz next
Monday we can really look forward
with interest to the material that
they will develop plus the material
on hand which at this time is an
unknown quantity.
One thing we can't understand
is why the A.S.S.U. high moguls
and the administration waited un
til this late date to give the O.K.
on football for this year. We will
probably have to be satisfied with
rooting for U.C.L.A. at the Cali
fornia-U.C.L.A. contest on No
vember 24.
As a clincher to our argument
for sports we would like to add
that Spike Cordeiro, the hoy who
ran wild against Cal for St. Mary's
last week, had every intention of
going to Stanford this year if they
had just had football, but instead
he journeyed to St. Mary's and
bis countryman Herman Wede
meyer and Spike teamed up to
give St. Mary's one hell of a good
hackfield.
