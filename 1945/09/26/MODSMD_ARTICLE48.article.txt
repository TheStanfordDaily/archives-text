# Intramurals Start Oct. 9
## 
### 
Intramural touch football will be
gin on October 9, Mr. Bugge, di
rector of the men's intramural
sports program, announced yester
day. Team entries are being taken
now and until October 6.
Intramural football differs great
ly, in many respects, from regular
football. For those that are not fa
miliar with the intramural pigskin
rules some of the more pertinent
ones will be given here.
The game is played with six men
instead of the usual eleven in reg
ular football. Passing may be done
up to the line of scrimmage, and all
players are eligible receivers. When
a team reaches or passes mid-field
strip they shall have only four
downs to reach the goal.
The field is GO yards long and 40
yards wide. The actual playing time
is 40 minutes. Kick-offs are made
from the 15-yard line and the
"touch" is with both hands. Regu
lation five-yard penalties are three
yards, and 15-yard penalties are
nine.
Anyone interested in forming a
team should see Mr. Bugge as soon
as possible. Teams must be en
tered under a hall name. Halls may
enter more than one team if they
wish.
