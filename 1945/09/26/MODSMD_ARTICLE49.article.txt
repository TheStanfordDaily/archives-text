NEW YORK, Sept. 25.—(UP).—
Nearly 2,000 students of two Brook
lyn high schools stayed away from
classes, arrived late or staged other
demonstrations today in support of
the Metropolitan Athletic Coaches'
strike for more pay.
A total of 148 high school coaches
in the greater New York area went
on strike this week after protracted
negotiations in which they failed to
obtain compensation for their ath
letic duties in addition to their sal
aries as faculty members.
