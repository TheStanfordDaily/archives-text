SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25. (UP)
â€”Pauline Betz, former women's
national tennis champion, said to
day that she had received no offi
cial request to come to Argentina
to participate in tennis tourna
ments.
Miss Betz, replying to reports that
she would' make a South American
tour this winter, asserted that all
she knew about the tour was when
she had read from newspaper re
ports.
She indicated, however, that she
probably would be receptive to such
an invitation.
