# Former Manila Internees Here To Realize Old Dreams at Last
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
Two would-have-been members
of the Class of 47 realized old
dreams to attend Stanford when
they registered yesterday â€” two
years late because a little thing
J ike the Japanese invasion of the
Philippines interrupted their plans
to come in 1943.
They are Betty Silen, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Bert Silen of Palo
Alto, and Bill Bauman, whose home
is in Omaha, Nebraska. Both were
residents of Manila when war broke
in the Philippines on Monday, De
cember 8. And both spent intern
ment in Santo Tomas and Los Ba
nos concentration camps. They are
two of eight Stanford students who
lived out the duration in civilian
concentration camps in the Philip
pines. When the war started . . .
But let them tell their story:
Basketball and Bombs
''We were up in Baguio, playing
an exchange basketball game with
Brent School there, when we first
heard that the Japs had bombed
Pearl Harbor," Miss Silen began;

"so we drove back to Manila that
night but we were held up in Ta
ralac because the Japs had started
bombing us.
"We all went to school as usual
Monday morning, and students kept
coming in late asking whether we
should stay at school or where we
should go. By Tuesday a lot of
them had gone home, and some had
left with their families for Baguio
where they thought they'd be safer.
But the Japs bombed Baguio right
away, and all of them came back
soon."
Into Internment
Shortly after the Japanese occu
pation of Manila, nearly all the Al
lied residents of that city were or
dered to the University of Santo
Tomas which had been set up as the
first civilian concentration camp in
the Philippines. By Feb. 13, 1942,
several thousand civilian prisoners
had been herded into Santo Tomas.
"For a while there was no or
ganization," said Miss Silen. "We
had to sleep wherever there was
room in the building."
Later on the Japs got segregation
conscious, she added, and separate
dormitories were set up for women
and men.
Prsion Labor
In May of 1943, Bauman with 800
men of military age (18 and older)
were transferred south to Los Ba
nos where they built, under Jap
orders, the camp by that name. The
camp was established on the out
skirts of the University of the Phil
ippines' Agricultural School, and
while the Americans were building
their quarters they lived in the
school gymnasium.
"We built barracks of wooden
construction, with board floors, dirt
corridors, and nipa roofs," Bauman
continued. "The barracks were di
vided into cubicles, each one to
house six men. There were cubicles
for married couples that were
smaller. All in all it was much bet
ter than Santo Tomas."
The men at Los Banos were re
quired to give two hours of work
a day toward the upkeep of the
camp. In that way they cleared
swamps surrounding the camp, and
were able to plant gardens and
raise their own vegetables.
Starvation Rations
"However," Bauman warned, "our
basic grain ration was allotted us
by the Japs and we were given only
100 grams of rice per day per per
son. And although we had more
and better food than Santo Tomas,
we never had the reserve food stock

they had, and our last two months
of starvation were worse than at
Santo Tomas."
"Perhaps the most interesting
thing about our life at Los Banos
was the college we started there,"
Bauman continued. "Larry Heb
bard, an economist on the High
Commissioner's staff, organized a
Class of '47 consisting of 15 college
boys. We had our own school build
ing and each six months elected a
new class adviser."
Jap Bewilderment
"The Japs wanted to know why
any of us wanted to study," Miss
Silen put in. "They said we would
be there for a hundred years and
couldn't understand why we went
to all the trouble of reorganizing
school classes in the camps."
"Eric Green of Peking was the
first chairman of our education
committee," Bauman continued,
"but the man who probably did
most to really rouse school spirit
was Frank Mortlock, an engineer
and graduate of Carnegie Institute
of Technology."
Mortlock was the second elected
class adviser and he formed foot
ball, baseball, basketball, and track
teams. "He also organized a sort
of fraternity of the Class of '47,"
Bauman said, "and he designed pins
for us to wear made out of hard
wood."
Interned Faculty
The school faculty consisted
mainly of engineers interned in the
camp, and Bauman completed his
first year of college calculus and
vector analysis while in Los Banos.
The school had a library of books
contributed from the pei'sonal li
braries of the internees.
"All our courses had to be lec
ture coUlrses, however," Bauman
added, "because we had no paper."
"They even organized a scholar
ship fund under the leadership of
Mortlock and two other business
men in camp. Each individual who
subscribed to the fund pledged
from $50 to $500 payable at the end
of the war. The money was con
verted into three scholarships of
$2,500 each, which were given to
the three best all-round students
as soon as the war was over. The
three boys who won them were
given their choice of which college
they wished to attend, and the only
stipulation in the fund was that
they maintain a "C" average. No,
I'm afraid that none of the three
picked Stanford as their school,"
Bauman grinned.
Class of '47
The Class of '47 is having its first
meeting in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in
1947, and plans to meet every five
years thereafter. Their pin has been
made into gold, consisting of a key
with a shield in front of it and the
number 47 embossed on the shield.
By the end of internment the Class
of '47 numbered 23, only five of
whom were girls. Each member had
to be of college age, and had to
have completed the equivalent of
one year in college before he could
fulfill entrance requirements.
"The end of decent food stopped
in June of 1944," Bauman said, "and
in December we had to stop classes.
By that time the Japs' starvation
plan coupled with air raids became
too much for us."
Los Banos Transfer
Miss Silen spent most of her in
ternment in Santo Tomas, but in
December 1944 she and her family
were moved to Los Banos, which at
the time of liberation housed ap
proximately 2,000 internees.
"The great day," said Bauman,
"was February 23 at 7 a.m. We were
just getting up for roll call when
the 11th Airborne Division dropped
paratroopers into the camp. Gueril
las covered the camp from behind
to prevent the Japs from getting
away to the hils, and amtracks were
on either side of us. The Japs im
mediately began firing on the in
ternees' barracks, but no one was
seriously injured. We were given

two hours to collect all the personal
belongings we could carry with us,
and then we left, burning the camp
behind us. We didn't want the Japs
to get a chance to loot the place,"
he added.
Retreat to Freedom
The internees were taken on am
tracks across Laguna de Bay, a
lake near Los Banos, and were
quartered in Muntinlupa prison,
outside of Manila, until they were
repatriated.
"It was a great day for all of us,"
Miss Silen said.
Among other recently liberated
internees now attending Stanford
are Shirley Silen, Jacqueline Flan
nery, Colleen Marshall, Evelyn
Wythe, Byron Ford, and David Civ
ian.
