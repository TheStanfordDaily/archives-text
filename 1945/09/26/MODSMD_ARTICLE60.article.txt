# Lucie La Comes to Lagunita
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
"They let me in way back in 11)33
—the year the quota of Stanford
women was boosted from 500 to
800," jokes Miss Lucie Lataillade,
new director of Lagunita. "The
change really wasn't obvious," she
is quick to explain, "but it caused
quite an uproar among the men.
You were either one of the 500 or
one of the 300—and it definitely
wasn't a compliment to be called
one of the 500.
"That year the Gaieties featured
an act contrasting the supposedly
queen-like 300 and the book-weary,
bespectacled 500." Miss Lataillade
points out that the incoming Fresh
men women are evidence that brains
don't necessarily have to hide behind
a book and horn rims.
Unless you go to see Miss
Latc'illade strictly on business,
don't bother struggling through the
pronunciation of her Frenchy name
—Miss La is plenty. She claims that
her tool-proof way of spotting a
stranger is noting whether or not
he tries to stumble through La-ty
ad, Lay-tile-ade, or any of the oth
er mispronounciations of her name.
"It all started back in Roble,"
explains Miss La. That was after
her graduation from Stanford, when
she was serving as assistant director
of Roble. "One of the fresh girls
was having particular trouble with
my name," she says, "so one day she
meekly tested abbreviating it to
Miss La. I answered to that name,
and it's been Miss La ever since."
Roble To Ventura
From assistant directorship of
Roble, Miss La advanced to the di

rectorship of Casa Ventura. "I was
at Ventura," she says,"the year that
the present seniors were frosh." For
the past two years, Miss La served
as director of the Freshman-Junior
dormitory at Pomona.
"One thing that Lagunita will be
spared is my cooking," points out
Miss La, rather regretfully. She ex
plains that she doesn't stick to plain
cooking, but spends most of her time
in the kitchen experimenting and
concocting new dishes. "The size of
the Lagunita kitchenettes will hard
ly allow for much of this sort of
thing," she says, "but maybe it's
just as well. Many's the time people
have had to struggle politely through
dishes, that I didn't dare repeat
apain."
New Lagunita StafT
Miss La is starting the year at
Lagunita with a "brand new" staff.
The only "old timer," according to
Miss La is Mrs. Lyn Mathews, resi
dent assistant in Olivo. Mrs. Mary
Benjamin, also new to Lagunita, is
serving as assistant director, and the
new resident assistants are Miss
Muriel Tarr, Granada ,who gradu
ated from Stanford in 1944; Miss
Jean Pehl, Casa Naranja, who grad
uated last spring and sponsored at
Ventura last year; and Mrs. Kathcr
ine Nelson, Adclfa, who is new to

quite an uproar among the men.
You were either one of the 500 or
one of the 300—and it definitely
wasn't a compliment to be called
one of the 500.
"That year the Gaieties featured
an act contrasting the supposedly
queen-like 300 and the book-weary,
bespectacled 500." Miss Lataillade
points out that the incoming Fresh
men women are evidence that brains
don't necessarily have to hide behind
a book and horn rims.
Unless you go to see Miss
Latc'illade strictly on business,
don't bother struggling through the
pronunciation of her Frenchy name
—Miss La is plenty. She claims that
her tool-proof way of spotting a
stranger is noting whether or not
he tries to stumble through La-ty
ad, Lay-tile-ade, or any of the oth
er mispronounciations of her name.
"It all started back in Roble,"
explains Miss La. That was after
her graduation from Stanford, when
she was serving as assistant director
of Roble. "One of the fresh girls
was having particular trouble with
my name," she says, "so one day she
meekly tested abbreviating it to
Miss La. I answered to that name,
and it's been Miss La ever since."
Roble To Ventura
From assistant directorship of
Roble, Miss La advanced to the di

rectorship of Casa Ventura. "I was
at Ventura," she says,"the year that
the present seniors were frosh." For
the past two years, Miss La served
as director of the Freshman-Junior
dormitory at Pomona.
"One thing that Lagunita will be
spared is my cooking," points out
Miss La, rather regretfully. She ex
plains that she doesn't stick to plain
cooking, but spends most of her time
in the kitchen experimenting and
concocting new dishes. "The size of
the Lagunita kitchenettes will hard
ly allow for much of this sort of
thing," she says, "but maybe it's
just as well. Many's the time people
have had to struggle politely through
dishes, that I didn't dare repeat
apain."
New Lagunita StafT
Miss La is starting the year at
Lagunita with a "brand new" staff.
The only "old timer," according to
Miss La is Mrs. Lyn Mathews, resi
dent assistant in Olivo. Mrs. Mary
Benjamin, also new to Lagunita, is
serving as assistant director, and the
new resident assistants are Miss
Muriel Tarr, Granada ,who gradu
ated from Stanford in 1944; Miss
Jean Pehl, Casa Naranja, who grad
uated last spring and sponsored at
Ventura last year; and Mrs. Kathcr
ine Nelson, Adclfa, who is new to
Stanford.
"They let me in way back in 11)33
—the year the quota of Stanford
women was boosted from 500 to
800," jokes Miss Lucie Lataillade,
new director of Lagunita. "The
change really wasn't obvious," she
is quick to explain, "but it caused
quite an uproar among the men.
