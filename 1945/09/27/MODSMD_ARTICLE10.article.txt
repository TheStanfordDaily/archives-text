# Chaparral Starts Tryout Period Tonight With Jobs Open For Various Talents
## 
### 
Samples of stories and cartoons
will be welcomed by staff members
of the Chaparral tonight when they
introduce a period of tryouts for stu
dents who are interested in work
ing on the campus humor magazine
at 7:30 p. m. in the Chaparral ofTicc,
second floor of the Press Building.

The Chappie was put out by four
people during the war and only two
of the four veteran staff members
have returned this year. They ex
i pect to leave shortly. "Therefore
there is plenty of opportunity for
anyone who is interested in this line
of work to work into a good posi
tion," said Editor Dick Driscoll.
Positions Open
Many positions on the business
staff as well as the editorial staff
arc open, and office work is greatly
needed. The editorial staff offers po
sitions as humor writers and car
toonists.
The Chappie is usually published
| twice per quarter, although only one
j issue will come out this quarter be
cause of the shortage of staff mem
bers. Because of the hasty depart
ure of past editor Barney Gugel,
Dick Driscol has been appointed
temporary editor.
Staff Named
Bill Shcppard will be managing
| editor; Don Allan, associate editor;
I Don Miller, art editor, Flo Bailey,
j women's editor; Par Pagcn, business
i manager; and Patty Burwell, ex
-5 change editor.
Navy students, who have been
i officially encouraged to take part in
[ extra-curricular activities, are es
! peciflly invited to join the staff. If
tonight's meeting is inconvenient to
Navy students, they are asked to
drop by the Chappie office for in-
I dividual interviews.

Rating High
Chaparral is published by Ham
mer and CofTin, the national humor
society founded at Stanford on the
eve of the H>0fi earthquake. Al
though some chapters of this so
ciety in the West were temporarily
disbanded, and many campus maga
zines, according to an informal rat
ing. cut down the content and the
use ol improved technical facilities
in their issues, Stanford continued
to publish with a rating as high
i nationally as ever in pre-war years.
