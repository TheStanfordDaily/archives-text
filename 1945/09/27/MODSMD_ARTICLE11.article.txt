# Marchie Schwartz To Call For Farm Football Team
## 
### 
Marchie Schwartz, recently ap
pointed head football coach, will
issue a call for a football team
when he returns to the campus
early next week, announced A.S.-
S.U. President Bob Kennedy at the
first meeting of the 1945-46 Excom
last night.
Kennedy emphasized, however,
that Stanford's chance of raising
any kind of a team this year would
depend entirely on the turnout for

Coach Schwartz' call. And even
with a team, Stanford will not enter
the Pacific Coast Conference this
fall. The most hopeful plan is that
informal games may be scheduled
with nearby colleges or service
teams when and if a Farm team is
in shape to play.
Coach Schwartz, a devotee of the
"T" formation, has spent the past
month at the University of Pitts
burgh, present headquarters of
Clark Shaughnessy who with his

"T" coached the Farm's 1940 team
into the Rose Bowl.
"In any event," Kennedy said,
"we will definitely start intercol
legiate sports with basketball this
winter, and we should be back on
our feet by fall of '46."
In discussing the program for the
coming school year, Kennedy de
clared that he approved trying out
the new A.S.S.U. constitution, and
that he favored waiting until spring
quarter student body elections bc

fore the constitution was put to an
all-campus vote.
"But I want to go on reord," lie
added, "that I'm definitely not in
favor of area representation." He
cited the case of the Excom rep
resentative from Sequoia Hall, say
ing that now Sequoia is closed, he
represents no area.
The constitution was drawn up
during the 1944-45 school year, and
was adopted for trial use for this
year's student government. It will
be put to a student vote for ratifi
cation during this academic year.
Most radical change in the constitu
tion was the adoption of Exom rep
resentation by living group areas
rather than by classcs.
A program outline for the annual
all-University assembly to be held
next Monday morning was pre
sented to Excom by Kennedy. The
student body will be introduced to
the new Dean of Students, John M.
Stalnaker, at that time. Faculty
members and Excom representa
tives will sit on the stage and the
latter will be introdued to the stu
dents, Kennedy announced.
The assembly is being planned in
co-operation with the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Excom discussed an invitation
from the University of California to
have Stanford attend the Cal--U.C.
L.A. football game scheduled for
Nov. 24. Decision on accepting the
invitation was postponed because
the date of the game conflicts with
Stanford's Thanksgiving vacation.
Excom approved a plan to write
a letter to President Sproul of the
University of California recom
mending leniency in the case of a
Cal football player who was sus
pended from the team because of
his part in the Stanford Axc-steal
ing summer quarter.
