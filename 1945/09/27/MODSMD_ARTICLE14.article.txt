TOKYO, Thursday, Sept. 27 (UP).
â€”Emperor Hirohito called upon
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur at the
American embassy in Tokyo this
morning and talked, through an in
terpretex% for more than half an
hour with the supreme Allied com
mander for Japan.
It was believed that the visit was
purely a social one and that the
Mikado and the man whose word he
must obey did not discuss any
problems connected with the Allied
occupation of beaten Japan.
It was the first time in his career
that Hirohito, looked upon as a god
by his people, had ever called on
a foreign representative, although
in 1933 he had gone to Tokyo station
to meet Emperor Kanteh (Henry
Pu Yi) of Manchuria. The Man
churian emperor now is in Allied
custody.
Yesterday Gen. Mac Arthur, in a
swords - to - plowshares decree, or
dered Japan's huge arsenal of
weapons, with which she hoped to
conquer half the world, reduced to
scrap and converted to peacetime
construction.
In the same directive to the Japa
nese government he ordered all
army-navy supplies of food, cloth
ing and transportation turned over
to the Japanese home ministry for
civilian use to avert famine this
winter.
