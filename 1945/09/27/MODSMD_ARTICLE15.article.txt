# More Strikes Face Nation

### 
CHICAGO, Sept. 26 (UP). â€”Oil
workers, New York building serv
ice employees and West Coast lum
berjacks marshaled their forces to
night for a showdown as strikes
throughout the nation idled more
than 672,000 men.
Extension of the oil strike, which
already has crippled the production
to 24 refineries, was seen as certain
if a U.S. conciliation conference in
Chicago failed to find a solution to
the bitter dispute between the Oil
Workers' International Union and
14 major companies.
O. A. Knight, international presi
dent of OWIU, was given blanket
authority to call out the rest of the
250,000 members of his union if an
agreement was not reached. Al
ready 26.000 refinery workers in six
states were striking, cutting off at
least a third of the nation's gasoline
production.
The federal government was pre
paring to take firm steps to restore
normal production of gasoline if ef
forts to settle the bitter refinery
strikes failed. In Washington, the
United Press was told that the gov
ernment would use its wartime sei
zure powers to restore gasoline pro
duction if the dispute was not set
tled by the end of the week.
The West Coast lumber dispute
threatened to spread to 40,000 more
workers.
