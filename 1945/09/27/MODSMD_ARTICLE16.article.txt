LONDON. S<?pt. 20.—(UP).—Dr.
Herbert V. Evatt. Australian foreign
minister, today declared his sup
port in principle of the Soviet pro
posal to the Big Five foreign min
isters council that an allied control
commission be set up to shape occu
pation policy in Japan.
Th? plain-spoken Australian re
sorted to the breezy idiom of the
antipodes in telling a press confer
ence that he thought Australia
should have a "fair go" in discus
sions of the world peace settlement,
which he contended could not right
fully bt limited to the topics on the
agenda of the current meeting.
His plea ran counter to the Amer
ican reply to the Soviet proposal,
to wit, that the Pacific had not been
slated for discussion at the London
meeting and that the American dele
gation had not come prepared for
such discussion.
