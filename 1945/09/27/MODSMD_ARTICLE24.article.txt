# Kolar Asks Full Social Calendar
## 
### 
Here's a call to all living groups—
this post-war social life had better
start pretty soon. At this point in

the year, there
are a great many
week-ends com
ing, and its up
to all of you
to provide some
thing to do on
them.
You know, we
usually get into
a rut around the
last couple of
months in spring

quarter. At that point, every house
which hasn't given a dancc or a
fireside decides that it might as
well give one. This results in so
many dances on one night that you
can't even get to half of them. How
about spreading these around a
little more during the year?
The social calendar stands quite
clean and empty now. The Reg
Dance is on schedule for this Satur
day night, but after that there's a
whole quarter of vacant Fridays
and Saturdays. Dances this quar-
I ter, since there aren't so many of
| them, will be pretty sure to go over
i big. You can start out your big
j success by just going down to the
j A.S.S.U. office and making out an
! application for a date—and this is
* the time to do it.
