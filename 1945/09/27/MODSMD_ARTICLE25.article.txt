# Dean Stalnaker Requests "Old Timers'" Assistance
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
"I hate to be called Dean. Just call
me Mr. Stalnaker," was the laugh
ing remark of Stanford's newest offi
cial.
A Daily reporter sat down, and
her knees stopped knocking. For
two days she had periodically looked
through the door marked "Dean of
Students". "Maybe I'll drop my
notes or mispronounce his name,"
she had muttered retreating nerv
ously. But at last she had pushed
her way through the crowded door
way for an interview.
'A Bewildered Freshman'
Now her courage rose amazingly,
for Mr. John M. Stalnaker was say
ing, "I feel like a bewildered fresh
man. This is a new university, and
I have a great deal to learn. I hope
you old-timers will be patient teach
ers."
Our new Dean has a startling
teaching record himself, for he has
handled every possible grade be
tween kindergarten and the last
class of graduate work. As a mere
high school graduate he taught an
entire Canadian grammar school, and
he describes it as the hardest job
he tvei had. Children of all ages i
rode to his classes on horseback to
learn every subject from reading to !
geography.
He left this tiny school house to
major in chemistry at the University 1
of Chicago. And he added tennis,
track competition, and a mathe- |

matics minor to his full laboratory
schedule.
Then he was teaching again, this
time at high school and later Pur
due University.
For one year he took a leave of
absence to do a study for the Uni
versity of Minnesota on "Attitudes
Toward Athletics." His research in
cluded faculty, students, alumni,
and people of the state; the first
of its kind at Minnesota. Results
showed "tremendous interest in in
tercollegiate athletics."
He then joined the staff of the Uni
versity of Chicago and subsequently
Princeton University.
Way Back When
He first visited Stanford before
the Hoover Library was even drawn
on blueprints. Herbert Hoover had
just been elected President of the
United States. Mr. Stalnaker was
crossing the country, and he had a
sightseer's interest in the President's
Alma Mater. But on each subsequent
visit hit interest became keener and
more personal,
Now he is Stanford's first Dean of
Students, and he faces a hard job.
He must coordinate all activities of
the students outside of classrooms.
This includes assemblies, resi
dences, athletics, social life, voca
tional guidance, placement, parttimc
jobs, and much more.
But he just grins when he thinks
of the work ahead. He seems to
think that student government has

already done an unusually fine job.
He describes it as one of the strong
est student controls he has ever
known. "I only hope Stanford can
continue to be the same type of in
stitution it is now," he said.

she had muttered retreating nerv
ously. But at last she had pushed
her way through the crowded door
way for an interview.
'A Bewildered Freshman'
Now her courage rose amazingly,
for Mr. John M. Stalnaker was say
ing, "I feel like a bewildered fresh
man. This is a new university, and
I have a great deal to learn. I hope
you old-timers will be patient teach
ers."
Our new Dean has a startling
teaching record himself, for he has
handled every possible grade be
tween kindergarten and the last
class of graduate work. As a mere
high school graduate he taught an
entire Canadian grammar school, and
he describes it as the hardest job
he tvei had. Children of all ages i
rode to his classes on horseback to
learn every subject from reading to !
geography.
He left this tiny school house to
major in chemistry at the University 1
of Chicago. And he added tennis,
track competition, and a mathe- |

matics minor to his full laboratory
schedule.
Then he was teaching again, this
time at high school and later Pur
due University.
For one year he took a leave of
absence to do a study for the Uni
versity of Minnesota on "Attitudes
Toward Athletics." His research in
cluded faculty, students, alumni,
and people of the state; the first
of its kind at Minnesota. Results
showed "tremendous interest in in
tercollegiate athletics."
He then joined the staff of the Uni
versity of Chicago and subsequently
Princeton University.
Way Back When
He first visited Stanford before
the Hoover Library was even drawn
on blueprints. Herbert Hoover had
just been elected President of the
United States. Mr. Stalnaker was
crossing the country, and he had a
sightseer's interest in the President's
Alma Mater. But on each subsequent
visit hit interest became keener and
more personal,
Now he is Stanford's first Dean of
Students, and he faces a hard job.
He must coordinate all activities of
the students outside of classrooms.
This includes assemblies, resi
dences, athletics, social life, voca
tional guidance, placement, parttimc
jobs, and much more.
But he just grins when he thinks
of the work ahead. He seems to
think that student government has

already done an unusually fine job.
He describes it as one of the strong
est student controls he has ever
known. "I only hope Stanford can
continue to be the same type of in
stitution it is now," he said.
"I hate to be called Dean. Just call
me Mr. Stalnaker," was the laugh
ing remark of Stanford's newest offi
cial.
A Daily reporter sat down, and
her knees stopped knocking. For
two days she had periodically looked
through the door marked "Dean of
Students". "Maybe I'll drop my
notes or mispronounce his name,"
she had muttered retreating nerv
ously. But at last she had pushed
her way through the crowded door
way for an interview.
