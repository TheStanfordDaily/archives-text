## SITUATION WELL IN HAND

We were sitting in our office mulling over
suggestions on how the Daily could help the
NROTCs, the ASTs, the ASTRPs to become an
integral part of Stanford life this autumn quarter,
when in walked the Army and the Fleet; re
suits of thai meeting of the Daily and the armed
forces are shown on page four under the title
of Stanford Army-Navy News. On the khaki
side are columns familiar to summer quarter
readers, as well as news and sport items from
the boys in the "west half of Encina." The
Navy share of the page is new to the campus,
as are the 200 residents of Toyon, who, we hope,
will retain throughout the year the impression
of Stanford they express so warmly in Iheir
columns.
