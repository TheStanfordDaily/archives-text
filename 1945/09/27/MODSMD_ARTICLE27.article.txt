# TO TRANSFER STUDENTS
## 
### 
Although Stanford, from an academic stand
point, has always welcomed transfers from
other universities, socially we have been awk
ward in our reception for the past few yeais.
This year the first step was made toward
orientation of women transfers when Casa Ven
tura was set up as a residence solely for upper
division transfers, progress which had its roots
in a recommendation of the student-composed
women's housing committee. Ventura residents
have been "learning Stanford" since Reg Day
with the help of four sponsors, another long
needed innovation.
The only unfulfilled hope we cherish is that
some day a wide-awake Pre-Reg Committee
such as the last one will see fit to include trans
fers in their whole pre-registration program of
introduction to the Farm. Then maybe our
transfer students will know how glad we are
to have them join us.â€”N. S.
