# TRAFFIC JAM
## 
### 
With the return of increased traffic and cars
on campus, we have several suggestions that
may alleviate in part the jam-ups at congested
areas:
1. Institute angle parking at the Cellar. By
painting white lines as guides there will be more
room to back out, less congestion as two cars
wait to pass.
2. Designate a restricted zone adjacent to
the Post Office to prevent noontime and 8
o'clock rushes. Allow bicycles only to park im
mediately in front of the door.
3. Remove chains at the Engineering corner
to permit bicycles through. This is a sore spot
all morning with bicycles trying to squeeze
through two narrow openings.
4. A system of one-side-only parking on the
Row. Many cars could just as easily park be
hind the houses, leaving space for visitors.
When the bus comes, narrow squeezes are in
evitable. Several girls have reported near ac
cidents trying to dodge autos.
5. Provide more bicycle stands at living
groups to prevent bicycles being strewn over
walks, parking strips, and front lawns.—Bill
