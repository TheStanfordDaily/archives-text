### STANLEY WILSON 
When Edit Board gave me this job, I was told fo
write about "anything." 1 probably will. I'm inter
r.sted in girls, beer. Political Science, what kind of a
bow tie Mr. Truman wears to his conferences, how
much weight our friend Hirohito lost during the war,
"itls, beer, and most any other thing of importance.
For example I'm interested in what kind of a deal
the returning servicemen are going to get at Stanford.
We have quite a reputation built up at the Farm.

They call it tradition, I think. And the veterans of
this war are going to want to see a little of that tra
dition exhibited in concrete form. There is a lot
of talk in this country about school, and about the
adjustments men overseas will have to make when
they come back. A lot of these men are back among
us now. It is all very true, an adjustment will have to
be made, but don't place all the responsibility on the
veteran. Perhaps we at Stanford should make some
sort of adjustment too. Remember they need us just
as vitally as we needed them, when our security was
threatened.

I'm also interested in the newly-formed NROTC
unit. I overheard one of the bluejackets on Quad
the other day. "If they gave me a little more liberty
and civilian clothes, I'd stay here forever," he told a
buddy. Nice sentiment, sailor, we like it here too. I
think the navy will be an asset around here. They
certainly were during the past three years. And they
brought sports back to the Farm, didn't they? Thanks,
fellas.

Afl"r that morning coffee in the Cellar, take a stroll
by the magazine counter and look at the cover of the
latest Post. A little thing drawn up by one Mead
Schaeffer. Darned interesting and entirely character
istic.

You probably will remember that last Spring quarter
some not-too-tactful characters from across the Bay
jobbed our coveted Axe. They hung onto it for a
few hours, but finally were nabbed by California's
most efficient Junior G-Men, the Paly police. The
boys were thrown in the pokey, finally were reprieved
by Sproul and went back to their prep school on the
promise of good behavior. There is a sequel to the
story: It seems last week the culprits came back on
campus and had a friendly chat with Pete in the Cellar
—the man from whom they stole the Axe. That's what
I like about those Cal fellows—a friendly sort.

I came back to Stanford this quarter anticipating a
peace-time schedule. I was assured of it when I saw
the increase in the number of cars prowling around.
Still want to be here when all the heliocopters start
landing on the lawn in front of Lagunita at about 1:29
some Saturday night soon. Ought to be quite a show.

Another thing I'm interested in is when they are go
ing to get that Pearl Harbor mess straightened out. It
seems too bacf that two such nice fellows as Kimmel
and Short should take the rap for a job as big as that
one. Personally, I don't think they could have done
it alone.

Official Welcome Department — Hello, freshmen,
transfers and new housemothers. Hope you like it
here; I have, since the year of the big wind of '37. Wel
come, good luck, God bless you, and let me borrow
your Time Schedule.

With the end of the war, it is my fervent hope that
WPB will release saddle shoes. Stanford without saddle
shoes is about as incongruous as one of Crosby's horses
hitting the wire before sundown.

Question of the Day Dept.: Will April Kane put the
big move on Col. Corkin and sink her hookers in him?
Will B.O. Plenty switch to Lifebuoy? How many rounds
will it take that big Palooka, Joe, to kayo Grumpopski,
the smoothest looking pharmacist mate in the navy?
What do you think C-Note will do to Cindy between
this writing and tomorrow's edition? Egad, not that!
—Buzz around in a couple of days and I'll meet
you right about here again. You know, I think I'm
going to like you. I'm interested in most everything.
