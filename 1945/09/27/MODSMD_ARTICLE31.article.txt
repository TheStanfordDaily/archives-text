THE LABOR PICTURE
Our industrial problem is confused, complex, and
very much out of hand. Unions are saying that their
hired economists have calculated such large profits for
big business that labor is demanding more of a share
of them.
Czars of Industry are retorting that the economists
are madmen and that the increased demands will
throw them out of business. With their personal bank
accounts, it wouldn't be too much of a catastrophe.
Big labor leaders, realizing this, are trying to get a
settlement, but little ones are walking out anyway.
And what of the legislative scene? The wiser congress
men are keeping quiet because of what might happen
in the next election, and the others are making very
stupid speeches.
The NLRB stands as strongly and solidly as any
toothless lion can, and is giving the impression of
being rather verbose fiction.
THE PICTURE
Yet the whole thing stands up as being the fight of
two organized minority groups for diametrically op
posite things. Those not in industry, and not in
executive offices in hig business, are standing on the
sidelines. They will not act until it is directly af
fecting them.
Now, various solutions have been put forward. Most
of them stand for arbitration with teeth in it. Yet. who
will arbitrate? Naturally, the government.
THE PROBLEM
So far everything is very simple and very fair, ex
cept that the strength of the American people has al
ways been that nobody trusted the government too far
when they could avoid it. Since both labor and manage
ment have enough power to kill the legislation creating
the arbitrating machinery, they probably will.
From management's standpoint, government reacts
to the strongest political pressure, and, at present, labor
exerts it. Therefore most of it would look at the ques
tion as one of trying to walk tightrope over a political
Grand Canyon while it had a case of gout.
Things appear differently to the labor leaders, but
the net result is the same. Most of them keep their
jobs come election time by thrusting through a new
wage increase, justified or not. Compulsory arbitration
would cranip their style, so they will use their highly
centralized powers to kill it.
THE NEW FACTOR
So, with compulsory arbitration shot through both
sides of the head, where are we? Labor still says that
it's being gyped, and management replies that wage
increases will kill prosperity in general and its busi
ness in particular.
The answer is simply that there will he a show
down fight on the question, and it's shaping up now.
If management wins, and doesn't try to go too far in
cutting wages, then the main result will he a few
labor leaders will he kicked out comes the next
union elections. If labor wins, and they have cal
culated correctly, then there will he no inflation
and that '"ill be the end of it until the next gen
eral wage increase demand comes.
But, when this trend finally starts catching the side
line standers—-the unorganized majority of the Ameri
can people—in the middle, then that majority will or
ganize, and demand a fair settlement of all questions.
Perhaps one step will he compulsory arbitration,
and perhaps something else, hut the logic of social
stresses and strains would point to something if the
infection affects everybody. In short, a solution of
these problems is possible, huf there will be a long
tight in getting it.

these problems is possible, huf there will be a long
tight in getting it.
THE LABOR PICTURE
Our industrial problem is confused, complex, and
very much out of hand. Unions are saying that their
hired economists have calculated such large profits for
big business that labor is demanding more of a share
of them.
Czars of Industry are retorting that the economists
are madmen and that the increased demands will
throw them out of business. With their personal bank
accounts, it wouldn't be too much of a catastrophe.
Big labor leaders, realizing this, are trying to get a
settlement, but little ones are walking out anyway.
And what of the legislative scene? The wiser congress
men are keeping quiet because of what might happen
in the next election, and the others are making very
stupid speeches.
The NLRB stands as strongly and solidly as any
toothless lion can, and is giving the impression of
being rather verbose fiction.
THE PICTURE
Yet the whole thing stands up as being the fight of
two organized minority groups for diametrically op
posite things. Those not in industry, and not in
executive offices in hig business, are standing on the
sidelines. They will not act until it is directly af
fecting them.
Now, various solutions have been put forward. Most
of them stand for arbitration with teeth in it. Yet. who
will arbitrate? Naturally, the government.
THE PROBLEM
So far everything is very simple and very fair, ex
cept that the strength of the American people has al
ways been that nobody trusted the government too far
when they could avoid it. Since both labor and manage
ment have enough power to kill the legislation creating
the arbitrating machinery, they probably will.
From management's standpoint, government reacts
to the strongest political pressure, and, at present, labor
exerts it. Therefore most of it would look at the ques
tion as one of trying to walk tightrope over a political
Grand Canyon while it had a case of gout.
Things appear differently to the labor leaders, but
the net result is the same. Most of them keep their
jobs come election time by thrusting through a new
wage increase, justified or not. Compulsory arbitration
would cranip their style, so they will use their highly
centralized powers to kill it.
THE NEW FACTOR
So, with compulsory arbitration shot through both
sides of the head, where are we? Labor still says that
it's being gyped, and management replies that wage
increases will kill prosperity in general and its busi
ness in particular.
The answer is simply that there will he a show
down fight on the question, and it's shaping up now.
If management wins, and doesn't try to go too far in
cutting wages, then the main result will he a few
labor leaders will he kicked out comes the next
union elections. If labor wins, and they have cal
culated correctly, then there will he no inflation
and that '"ill be the end of it until the next gen
eral wage increase demand comes.
But, when this trend finally starts catching the side
line standers—-the unorganized majority of the Ameri
can people—in the middle, then that majority will or
ganize, and demand a fair settlement of all questions.
Perhaps one step will he compulsory arbitration,
and perhaps something else, hut the logic of social
stresses and strains would point to something if the
infection affects everybody. In short, a solution of
these problems is possible, huf there will be a long
