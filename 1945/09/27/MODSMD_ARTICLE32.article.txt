# Greek War Record, Future Plans Displayed in Library Exhibit
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
When one thinks of Greece he
usually thinks of Socrates sitting
in an olive grove or of Pericles ad
dressing the Athenian youth, not of
the little war-and famine-ravaged
nation emerging from a bitter dic
tatorship and invasion to be wran
gled over by two powerful nations.
But despite two thousand years
involving change and decline, rem
nants of the Golden Age of Greece
can still be seen in towns and vil
lages, and the Plain of Marathon is
today the same plain on which the
Greeks defeated the Persians, al
though a shepherd boy and his dog
wander freely on it now.
On exhibit in the main library
now are photographs and book il
lustrations of Modern Greece and
pamphlets and books concerning
Greece's part in World War 11. They
have been arranged by W. O.
Youngs, reference librarian.
Robed women sit in the Parthe-.
Ancient architecture, notably the
lonic column, is reflected in new
government buildings in Athens.
Sketches for new buildings to house

the 200,000 homeless in Greece are
of simple, open, square, flat-roofed
houses for the sunny Mediterranean
climate.
Ships stored with wineskins go
out of the harbor and donkeys carry
pottery to sell. Sidewalk cafes are
more similar to those of Paris than
to the quiet olive groves where
Greek philosophers talked over
"beauty" and "good."
Fighting Greece
"The White Book," "Facts About
Fighting Greece," "Storm in
Greece" (the story of the EAM) tell
the story of Greece's stubborn re
fusal to submit to Italian and Ger
man ultimatums, their lightning in
vasions, and the guerilla resistance.
"Greek Fire" is by Andre Michaelo
poulos, former Greek' Minister of
Information, who will speak at the
Town Hall meeting in San Fran
cisco October 16!"

Other illustrations are of the
Sanctuary of Patmos in the eastern
Mediterranean, which is of the size
| of Manhattan Island and has a
church for every day in the year.
Mount Athos, a tiny peninsula into
which treasure from Europe drained
I for centuries, is shown as inhabited
j only by monks and at the time of
the printing it was speculated
whether the Germans had taken
over the independent community
| and its vast wealth.
Propaganda Pleas
Pamphlets are displayed of pleas
| by inhabitants of the Dodecanese
j islands that they be freed from
Italian domination and restored to
Greece, which probably has been
done or will be done in the near
future.
The exhibit cases are at the top
| and to either side of the main steps
I and will be there for three weeks.

When one thinks of Greece he
usually thinks of Socrates sitting
in an olive grove or of Pericles ad
dressing the Athenian youth, not of
the little war-and famine-ravaged
nation emerging from a bitter dic
tatorship and invasion to be wran
gled over by two powerful nations.
But despite two thousand years
involving change and decline, rem
nants of the Golden Age of Greece
can still be seen in towns and vil
lages, and the Plain of Marathon is
today the same plain on which the
Greeks defeated the Persians, al
though a shepherd boy and his dog
wander freely on it now.
On exhibit in the main library
now are photographs and book il
lustrations of Modern Greece and
pamphlets and books concerning
Greece's part in World War 11. They
have been arranged by W. O.
Youngs, reference librarian.
Robed women sit in the Parthe-.
Ancient architecture, notably the
lonic column, is reflected in new
government buildings in Athens.
Sketches for new buildings to house

the 200,000 homeless in Greece are
of simple, open, square, flat-roofed
houses for the sunny Mediterranean
climate.
Ships stored with wineskins go
out of the harbor and donkeys carry
pottery to sell. Sidewalk cafes are
more similar to those of Paris than
to the quiet olive groves where
Greek philosophers talked over
"beauty" and "good."
Fighting Greece
"The White Book," "Facts About
Fighting Greece," "Storm in
Greece" (the story of the EAM) tell
the story of Greece's stubborn re
fusal to submit to Italian and Ger
man ultimatums, their lightning in
vasions, and the guerilla resistance.
"Greek Fire" is by Andre Michaelo
poulos, former Greek' Minister of
Information, who will speak at the
Town Hall meeting in San Fran
cisco October 16!"

Other illustrations are of the
Sanctuary of Patmos in the eastern
Mediterranean, which is of the size
| of Manhattan Island and has a
church for every day in the year.
Mount Athos, a tiny peninsula into
which treasure from Europe drained
I for centuries, is shown as inhabited
j only by monks and at the time of
the printing it was speculated
whether the Germans had taken
over the independent community
| and its vast wealth.
Propaganda Pleas
Pamphlets are displayed of pleas
| by inhabitants of the Dodecanese
j islands that they be freed from
Italian domination and restored to
Greece, which probably has been
done or will be done in the near
future.
