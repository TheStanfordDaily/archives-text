# Eminent Farm Chemist Attends USSR Meeting
## 
### 
Professor James W. Mcßain, emi
nent Stanford chemist, was one of
five world-renowned scientists chos
en last July to represent the United
States at the 220 th Anniversary of
the Russian Academy of Sciences
in Moscow. He traveled to Russia in
a special Soviet plane direct from
San Francisco.
Sponsored and financed entirely
by the U.S.SR.., the conference
brought together representatives
from all branches of science from
many countries, even those who just
a fevA' months before had been at
war with Russia.
Telling of his adventure, Dr.
Mcßain says he believes the invi
tation "was not just a gesture of
politeness" but a sincere effort on
the part of the Russians to ac
tively cooperate and further a
free exchange of scientific inform
ation.
Soviets Share Science
Soviet scientists, and government
officials are "desperately in earnest
in their desire to share everything
they can in science for the good of
humanity," Dr. Mcßain declared.
Impressed by the speed of his
global adventure, the chemist
prophesied that world travel such
as his trip will be commonplace
in a decade or so. He said the
man with even a two weeks va
cation might tour the world.
New Civilization
Sidelines of the trip were just as
interesting in some ways as the cele
bration of the Russian Academy
itself. Dr. Mcßain tells how one of
the American scientists dropped off
to investigate a new neolithic civili
zation discovered by the Russians on

the shores of the Caspian sea.
Scientists receive an almost re
ligious admiration in Russia. No
movie star or foreign potentate ever
received a more cordial welcome
than did the world scientists. Even
large portraits of famed Russian
scientists are hung in the cities.
Leningrad Struck Hard
In describing his impressions. Dr.
Mcßain told how the outer parts of
Moscow were hard hit while the
center was intact. On the other
hand, seven out of ten of Lenin
grad's people had died. Their daily
ration was one piece of bread half
the size of a package of cigarettes.
Many parents died giving up their
ration to keep their children alive.
"We can't picture these things,"
the scientist said. "The Russians
estimate they have lost 22 million
people." In one research insti
tute alone, all the men were killed.
The Germans lost over one mil
lion in front of Leningrad.
Dead Soldiers Revived
Medically, the Soviets are far ad
vanced. They have developed re
search in low temperature therapy
and are concerned with bringing
the dead back to life.
Perhaps one contributing reason
for their scientific advancement
lies in the fact that they have
allowed many young scientists to
continue their research instead of
drafting them.
One of the leading physical chem
ists in America and an expert on
the theoretical chemistry of soaps,
Professor Mcßain is a Davy Medal
ist. Many of his papers and his book
on chemistry have been translated
into Russian.

grad's people had died. Their daily
ration was one piece of bread half
the size of a package of cigarettes.
Many parents died giving up their
ration to keep their children alive.
"We can't picture these things,"
the scientist said. "The Russians
estimate they have lost 22 million
people." In one research insti
tute alone, all the men were killed.
The Germans lost over one mil
lion in front of Leningrad.
Dead Soldiers Revived
Medically, the Soviets are far ad
vanced. They have developed re
search in low temperature therapy
and are concerned with bringing
the dead back to life.
Perhaps one contributing reason
for their scientific advancement
lies in the fact that they have
allowed many young scientists to
continue their research instead of
drafting them.
One of the leading physical chem
ists in America and an expert on
the theoretical chemistry of soaps,
Professor Mcßain is a Davy Medal
ist. Many of his papers and his book
on chemistry have been translated
into Russian.
Professor James W. Mcßain, emi
nent Stanford chemist, was one of
five world-renowned scientists chos
en last July to represent the United
States at the 220 th Anniversary of
the Russian Academy of Sciences
in Moscow. He traveled to Russia in
a special Soviet plane direct from
San Francisco.
Sponsored and financed entirely
by the U.S.SR.., the conference
brought together representatives
from all branches of science from
many countries, even those who just
a fevA' months before had been at
war with Russia.
Telling of his adventure, Dr.
Mcßain says he believes the invi
tation "was not just a gesture of
politeness" but a sincere effort on
the part of the Russians to ac
tively cooperate and further a
free exchange of scientific inform
ation.
Soviets Share Science
Soviet scientists, and government
officials are "desperately in earnest
in their desire to share everything
they can in science for the good of
humanity," Dr. Mcßain declared.
Impressed by the speed of his
global adventure, the chemist
prophesied that world travel such
as his trip will be commonplace
in a decade or so. He said the
man with even a two weeks va
cation might tour the world.
New Civilization
Sidelines of the trip were just as
interesting in some ways as the cele
bration of the Russian Academy
itself. Dr. Mcßain tells how one of
the American scientists dropped off
to investigate a new neolithic civili
zation discovered by the Russians on

the shores of the Caspian sea.
Scientists receive an almost re
ligious admiration in Russia. No
movie star or foreign potentate ever
received a more cordial welcome
than did the world scientists. Even
large portraits of famed Russian
scientists are hung in the cities.
Leningrad Struck Hard
In describing his impressions. Dr.
Mcßain told how the outer parts of
Moscow were hard hit while the
center was intact. On the other
hand, seven out of ten of Lenin
grad's people had died. Their daily
ration was one piece of bread half
the size of a package of cigarettes.
Many parents died giving up their
ration to keep their children alive.
"We can't picture these things,"

estimate they have lost 22 million
