# Grable, Faye Needed In Nob Hill Picture
## 
### 
NOB lIILL—Now playing at the
Varsity Theater
With Betty Grable and Alice
Faye absent from their lot, 20th
Century Fox have a hard time

whipping one of
their luscious,
marsh - mallowy
musical come
dies into shape.
It is in this re
spect that "Nob
Hill" suffers, for
Vivian Blaine
and Joan Ben
nett are certainly
no Grable-Faye
combination.

"Nob Hill" revolves around the
efforts of a Barbary Coast saloon
keeper, George Raft, to crash into
Nob Hill society, which seems to
have Miss Bennett as its focal point.
Mr. Raft, who is getting no younger,
receives all kinds of back-handed
treatment at the hands of the Snob
Hillers and eventually falls back
into the arms of Vivian Blaine, an
entertainer-temptress in his Bar
bary Coast palace. Peggy Ann Gar
ner bawls all over the screen dur
ing the course of the film, driving
most of the audience out to the
lobby for a quick cigarette. She

belongs in school and not in pic- i
tures.
Even the music in "Nob Hill" j
falls below the usual Fox standards, |
with "I Don't Care Who Knows It" j
being the only acceptable offering. I
Acting performances are all very
ordinary. Let's hope this is the last i
of the red-hot San Francisco epics, |
and that the fair city may soon be i
pictured without its brawls, broads, ,
and booze.
The second feature on the Var
sity double-header is an absorbing
affair titled "The Enchanted Cot
tage." Dorothy Maguire and Rob
ert Young star in this sympathetic
treatment of a returning veteran i
and his troubles. "The Enchanted
Cottage" is a tender, warming film |
that has received deft treatment at
the hands of a competent cast.
Now this reviewer would like to j
recommend a few films of the late
summer season for your attention, j
First is an engrossing psychological
murder picture, "The Strange Death '
of Uncle Harry," certainly one of
the year's ten best. Then there is
the candy - coated sun - splashed
"Thrill of a Romance," that has Van
Johnson for the Roble girls and
Esther Williams for the senior
males. Both of these releases should
meet with your approval. — Dick

ordinary. Let's hope this is the last i
of the red-hot San Francisco epics, |
and that the fair city may soon be i
pictured without its brawls, broads, ,
and booze.
The second feature on the Var
sity double-header is an absorbing
affair titled "The Enchanted Cot
tage." Dorothy Maguire and Rob
ert Young star in this sympathetic
treatment of a returning veteran i
and his troubles. "The Enchanted
Cottage" is a tender, warming film |
that has received deft treatment at
the hands of a competent cast.
Now this reviewer would like to j
recommend a few films of the late
summer season for your attention, j
First is an engrossing psychological
murder picture, "The Strange Death '
of Uncle Harry," certainly one of
the year's ten best. Then there is
the candy - coated sun - splashed
"Thrill of a Romance," that has Van
Johnson for the Roble girls and
Esther Williams for the senior
males. Both of these releases should
meet with your approval. — Dick

NOB lIILL—Now playing at the
Varsity Theater
With Betty Grable and Alice
Faye absent from their lot, 20th
Century Fox have a hard time

whipping one of
their luscious,
marsh - mallowy
musical come
dies into shape.
It is in this re
spect that "Nob
Hill" suffers, for
Vivian Blaine
and Joan Ben
nett are certainly
no Grable-Faye
combination.

"Nob Hill" revolves around the
efforts of a Barbary Coast saloon
keeper, George Raft, to crash into
Nob Hill society, which seems to
have Miss Bennett as its focal point.
Mr. Raft, who is getting no younger,
receives all kinds of back-handed
treatment at the hands of the Snob
Hillers and eventually falls back
into the arms of Vivian Blaine, an
entertainer-temptress in his Bar
bary Coast palace. Peggy Ann Gar
ner bawls all over the screen dur
ing the course of the film, driving
most of the audience out to the
lobby for a quick cigarette. She

belongs in school and not in pic- i
tures.
Even the music in "Nob Hill" j
falls below the usual Fox standards, |
with "I Don't Care Who Knows It" j
being the only acceptable offering. I
Acting performances are all very
ordinary. Let's hope this is the last i
of the red-hot San Francisco epics, |
and that the fair city may soon be i
pictured without its brawls, broads, ,
and booze.
