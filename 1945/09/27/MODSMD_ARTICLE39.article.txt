# Ideas From Servicemen For Postwar Farm Vary
## 
### 
Answers to the 6,300 letters sent
out by President Donald B. Tresid- i
der last spring to former Stanford \
studtnts now in service, asking how
Stanford could best serve them in
the postwar period, have been ar
riving from all over the world this I
summer.
The answers indicate that a large :
number of the former students are ,
anxious to return to the university i
and complete their training under |
the GI Bill of Rights. Fifty-five
per cent of them plan to enter the
four professional schools of Busi- ;
ness, Engineering, Law, and Medi
cine.
The servicemen vary in their op
inions as to how the curriculum j
should be altered to meet their
needs. Many of them express the
desire: "We want the same old Stan- I
ford, just as it was before we went 1
away." A private in the Palau Is
lands wrote: "The education con
ducted by the armed forces is mere
ly a technical one .... do not be

j stampeded into any general stream
i lining of your general college train-
I n g-"
On the other hand some men feel
as th* lieutenant on a light cruiser
in the Pacific: "I believe that it is
! necessary to recognize that the uni
| versity and college are going to be
! justified in the immediate future on
, utilitarian grounds only. The big
gest thing that will be in the minds
; of the men returning from this war
j will be time; each will have irre
! trievably lost from one to five years
I of his life . . .
