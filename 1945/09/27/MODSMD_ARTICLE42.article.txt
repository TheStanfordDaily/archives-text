In case you are wondering about
the repute of our two returning
coaches, Marchie Schwartz and Ev
erett Dean, or any of the Stanford
coaching staff for that matter, let us
give you a little lowdown on their
past records.
Dean Tops
Coach Dean has perhaps
achieved (lie most fame and glory
of any of the Indian mentors.
Ilis record at Indiana, where he
was head baseball and basketball
coach for fourteen years, speaks
for itself as well as his sparkling
achievements with the Stanford
quintets of '41 and '42. Dean is
not a coach who achieved his
standing because he was an All -
American center on the Indiana
basketball team in 1921 and 11)22;
he has definitely carved his niche
in Coaching annals for his coach
j injj prowess alone.
During 14 years at Indiana his
baseball nines and basketball teams
I achieved an average standing of sec
ond in the Big Ten. In both sports,
his teams copped three Big Ten
' championships apiece. He came to
' Stanford in 1938 and began to de
velop the famous team of 1940 and
j 1941 which copped the national in
i tercoliegiate title from Dartmouth
j after winning their first two games
by wide margins. Well known for
: his coaching strategy. Dean com
pletely crossed the Dartmouth of
j fense by using a different defense
: all three nights of competition.
Coaches' Coach
He also gives the fans what they
I like to see by using the fast break.
I and offense so charactertistic of
the East and Middle West. This
j makes for plenty of scoring and a
fast, exciting game. Moreover he
| is a coaches' coach, for he has
j been called upon several times to
teach coaching schools because of
the sound theories he has devel
oped and put into practice. Scores
of top basketball coaches all over
the country have received their
training under Dean. If there is â€¢
any material that has possibilities
for this year's team, we can be
| sure that Everett Dean will make
the most and more of it.
Schwartz Good
Marchie Schwartz, who is yet
! comparatively young in the coaching
! field, will have a good chance to
I show his stuff with the Stanford '46
J gridsters. He proved himself on able
backfields of '40 and '41, backfields
S that contained such stars as Frankie
Albert. Hugh Gallarneau, Norm
Standlee, Pete Kmetovic, "Rock"
j Sheller, and Buck Faucett. the lat
ter two becoming standouts on the
| Indian '42 eleven. Schwartz was
. head coach most of that season and
| developed a team that got better as
I it went along, and looked like one
I of the best on the coast at the end
of the season.
