PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 26 (UP).
—Crisp cool weather under clearing
skies today cheered the more than
100 topflight golfers ready to tee
off tomorrow for the $14,333 in
prizes in the second annual Port
land open golf tournament.
Byron Nelson, Sammy Snead,
Ben Hogan, Bob Hamilton and all
the "big names" of golf were on
hand, with every indication par
would be shattered on the long
difficult fairways of the Portland
golf course.
Considered hot bets to press Nel
son are Harold (Jug) McSpaden, of
Kansas City, second at Spokane;
Ben Hogan, Hershey, Pa.; Jimmy
Ferrier, the Army sergeant from
San Francisco; Jimmy Hines, Chi
cago; Ed Furgol, Detroit; Jack Gage,
San Bernardino; Leonard Dodson,
Kansas City; and George Fazio, the
Los Angeles pro with a good pre
round score of 68.
