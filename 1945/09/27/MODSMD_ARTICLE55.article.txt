### 
CHICAGO, Sept. 26 (UP).—The
St. Louis Cardinals, fighting with
the spirit of the old "Gashouse
Gang," kept alive their fading Na
tional League pennant hopes today
by outslugging the Chicago Cubs
for an 11 to 6 protested victory
which pulled them to within one
and a half games of the League
leaders.
Game Protested
The only consolation for the Cubs,
as they go to Cincinnati for a
! tomorrow, is that to
-1 day's game was played under pro
j test from the seventh inning on.
In the big Cardinal seventh, Um
j pire Lou Ballanfant ruled that Bill
j Nicholson of the Cubs caught Ray
I Sanders' fly against the right licld
| wall, which was turned into a
I double play that would have saved
| the day for the Cubs.
Under violent protest, however,
the Cardinals claimed that the
hall bounced out of Nicholson's
| glove up against the wall and
then was retrieved in the air.
Ballanfant reversed his decision.
' after 10 minutes of argument, and
gave Sanders a Single.
St. Louis then went on to pound
| across five runs.
The Cards' road is a rocky one.
They have four games left, start
ing with a single game against
Pittsburgh tomorrow, while the
j Cubs have five. If the Cubs lose
| three out of their remaining con
i tests, and the world champions
sweep their four, the Cards could
only tie for first place.
The Cubs chased an old Nemesis,
| Charley (Red) Barrett, who had
beaten them four straight times, in
the fourth inning when they pushed
across three runs to take a 3 to 2
lead. But just as the Cubs came
back to win yesterday's game, the
Cards pulled the same trick today.
