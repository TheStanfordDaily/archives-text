Pete the druggist making with the
sales talk:
Says Pete, "I have something here
that will make you popular, make
your school-life happier, give you
much added pep and energy and
bring you a host of new friends.

N.R.O.T.C. salt after 2 years in

Attention was called to the fact
that numerous couples were seen
waltzing around to the other side
of the lake from the barbecue Sun
day nite. Could they have possibly
been seeking a better view of the
boat races—or were those girls
freshmen ?
—o —
I think we should also pay tribute
to the guy who was practicing those
beautiful French phrases on his
dancing partners Saturday nite. He
seemed very successful until he met
a young lady who evidently knew
French—Or was that actually a mos
quito she was swinging at?
—o —
Incidentally could someone have
made a mistake in naming Roble
Hall? It looked more like Grand
Central Station after the dance Sat
urday nite.

Ana as for that worldly-wise
sophomore resident of Branner:
"You had better retract your re
cent statement as to the tunnel from
Toyon to Branner for some in our
midst have taken you literally and
if there wasn't one before it looks
like (here soon will be."

Note: If anyone read this expect
ing big things, please remember we
haven't been on the Farm but a
short while, so "Gimme a chance,
will ya?"
