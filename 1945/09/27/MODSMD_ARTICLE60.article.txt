# Navy Greeted With Jolly-Up
## 
### LES EICHORN 
The men of the newly commis
sioned Stanford N.R.O.T.C. Unit
greatly enjoyed the all-out friendli
ness of the student body and facul
ty members at the Pre-Reg, "Jolly-
Up" dance, last Saturday evening
in the Basketball Pavillion. At first
we were all a bit backward, as most
of us have been exempt from such
social functions for rather a long
period of time, but the efforts of the
Sponsors were soon recognized, and
all had a wonderful time. What
really impressed us most was the
abundance of the Stanford women,
not just attractive women, but beau
tiful women! The whole Unit ex
tends its whole-hearted thanks for
the honor of being invited, and wish
to say that, "We like Stanford and
we want Stanford to like us."
