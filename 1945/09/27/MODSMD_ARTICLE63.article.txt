Take down your service flag,
mother;
Your boy's in ithc R.O.T.C.
And so with fond farewells and
bitter tears we left our buddies and
shipmates, on their various foreign
outposts, and set sail for an Indian
reservation called Stanford. All
had happy, contented smiles as we
sailed under the dear old Golden
Gate.—How were we to know of the
trials and tribulations connected
with Reg day?—The optimists, with
long faces, standing in the seat card
line changing from you-know-what
to just plain "A." Spending the re
mainder of the morning sweating
out the photo line for two hours
only to be greeted at the head of
the line with "Sorry, that will be
all for this morning. Come back at
1 p.m. and we will take care of you."
And so it went on the Navy's first
day as Stanford students.—But say,
please don't think we're complain
ing! Gosh NO!! Just in case every
sailor • hasn't already told you in
dividually, let it be known that we
are all very happy to be here and
overwhelmed with the splendid way
in which everyone has welcomed
us as new papooses.
