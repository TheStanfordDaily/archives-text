# Bluejackets May Wear Red Jerseys
## 
### 
Eager Stanford sport fans have
been wondering whether or not the
N.R.O.T.C. students will be able to
compete in varsity sports, and if
there are any outstanding athletes
in their midst.
First - quarter, first - year stu
dents may participate in inter
collegiate sports with the permis
sion of Captain C. E. Crombe,
commanding officer of the Navy
unit at Stanford.
There are quite a number of blue
jackets who have had from two to
three years' experience in high
school as first-string players. Then,
too, there are a few who have
had experience with service teams.
Toyon Hall is looking forward to a
large turnout from these men as
well as from those who have hid
den skill and have not had the
chance to display their talent.
The N.R.O.T.C. physical fitness
program is under the direction of
Lt. W. 11. Williams. lie is as
sisted by M«1 Bruno, CSp(A),
William Ross, C'Sp(A), and Har
low Van Meter, Sp(A)l/c. We
have their assurance that the
men will be in top physical con
dition in a very short time, and
will be prospects for intercolle
giate competition.
The program will consist of the
following: calisthenics, distance
running, and participation in all
major sports. Through this wide
scale program the coaches will be
able to select material for the var
sity team.
In the future you can expect to
see many bluejackets' names on the
roster of the Stanford Red.
