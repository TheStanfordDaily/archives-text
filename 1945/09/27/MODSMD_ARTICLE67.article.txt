# Indoor Sports For ASTP's
## 
### 
Fall term intramural athlctics for
the ASTP will be in the form of
indoor sports. A change from the
original plan of touch football and
volleyball became necessary re
cently when Congress passed the
resolution which will turn back the
clock this Sunday. With Standard
Time, darkness will fall too early
to allow an hour of after-chow out
door activities.
Primary participation will be in
a basketball program which will
probably have next Wednesday as
its initial playing night. At the
present time the EM are being di
vided into two leagues while an
ERC loop will be organized upon
their return two weeks hence.
In addition to league basketball,
there will be tournaments in ping
pong, tennis, and horseshoes. Simi
lar elimination playoffs were suc
cessfully conducted during the sum
mer term.
