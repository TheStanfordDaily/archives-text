# Civilian Frosh Share Encina Copaseticism
##

Yes, that's right; you did see
sharp-looking sport jackets on fel
lows coming out of Encina. You also
saw flashy ties and they didn't be- j
long to the Army students stationed j
here. Male freshmen are now sub
letting a part of Encina Hall. Other \
than the Army waking the civilians
up at six-thirty in the morning,
and the civilians keeping the Army
up at night, everything is just cop
asetic.
The Army's 6-man football teams
are now going into their second
week. Last week all teams played,
and there was a good showing of
those teams which will be pushing
for the prizes offered to the win
ning team at the end of the season.
The big question among the AST's
and the ASTR's right now is wheth
er we are going to have GI dances
every week as in past quarters—
well, are we?
The Army wishes to express its
approval of the type of women
who can be found on the Farm this
term. All we can say is—hubba,
hubba.
This week-end the ASTAP will
say so long for a week to their little
brother, the ASTRP. They are go
ing home to see the folks for a short
time. Those lucky dogs have al
ready taken Basic Training and they
still have to go through it, ha, ha.

i Parsons, Gabelson, Figert, Yuro
witz, Speilberger, and Jim "But fella,
she goes for me!" Goodall. But, coeds,
this is slightly compensated for by
the arrival of 200 big, beautiful,
bowlegged NROTC's. The arrival of
the sailors is the greatest thing to j
hit this campus since Joey C. Heid- i
el berg hit a home run with four j
men on base.

Now that the civilian freshmen
have moved into the east wing of
Enema, we wonder how the new
occupants of room 101) are faring.
What dark secrets does this room
hold? What mysteries lurked be
neath its transoms? For here dwelt
Bert Feinberg, who in the wee after
taps hours held the ERC's awe-struck
with strange and fascinating tales of
j Lagunita and Roble. But this adviser
to the lovelorn and conductor of
after date critiques has been called
away in the service of his country.
He was last seen at the S.P. depot
one foggy night kissing a few inti
mate friends goodbye. The farewell
party included Meemi, Baumeister,
Meemi, Herman, Meemi, Claude, and
j of course Meemi.
