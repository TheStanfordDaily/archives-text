### 
Punch, cookies, and some lively
singing will be the features of Ven
tura's open house for about forty
of the new NROTC unit on Satur
day afternoon. The affair will be
informal but fun for everyone, ac
cording to Ventura's head sponsor,
Fran Jennings.
Plans for the event have been
handled by Jean Gait, the hall's so
cial chairman. Ventura is now oc
cupied by transfer students who are
new to the Farm. The get-together
will give everyone a chance to be
come acquainted with Stanford cus
toms and traditions, said Miss Jen
nings.
Ventura's first social event was
held Wednesday night when the
new students were welcomed at a
spread. Four birthdays were cele
brated at the affair and the girls
had a chance to meet each other.
The spread was held in the hall's
social room, which was decoratcd
for the occasioin. After the cake
was consumed, the students sang
and were entertained by a guitar
and piano. From all reports, the
combination spread-birthday party
was a success.
Ventura, as well as the other
houses on the campus, is planning
an etxensive social and activity
program for fall quarter. Special
attempts will be made to acquaint
the new transfers to Stanford life
as soon as possible. For this rea
son Ventura is one of the first wom
en's halls on campus to entertain
the Navy students. Since neither
the hostesses nor the guests have
been at -the Farm before, everyone
will be meeting new friends.
Fran Jennings reports that Ven
tura's spirit is excellent and that
she is looking forward to a lively
quarter.
