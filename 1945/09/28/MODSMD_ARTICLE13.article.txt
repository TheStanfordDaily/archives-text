a bridge tournament, a formal dance,
and a come as you are party.
Tuesday night Union Residence
had its first spread at which the
newcomers to the hall were intro

of their new home. It is reported
that the new post war enthusiasm
has spread throughout Union, and

Unit will do their part in adding to
