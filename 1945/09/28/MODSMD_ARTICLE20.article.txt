# Five Farm Men Aid Atomic Research
## 
### 
Five members of the Stanford
Physics Department have been in â€”
strumental in the development of the
atomic bomb, it was revealed today
by the War Department. Two of
them were present at, and partici
pated in, the now famous experi
mental test of the bomb in the New
Mexico desert near Alamogordo on
July 16.
The five Stanford men were: Dr.
Felix Bloch, professor of physics;
Dr. Norris E. Bradbury, professor
of physics; Dr. William W. Hansen,
professor of physics; Dr. Hans
Staub, assistant professor of physics;
and D. B. Nicodemus, research as
sistant.
Bloch Headed Research
Early in 1942 a Stanford research
group, headed by Professor Bloch,
was given a contract by the Office
of Scientific Research and Develop
ment to investigate certain proper
ties of uranium. With the lifting of
the censorship blackout, it now may
be told that Stanford's research in
nuclear physics helped to solve one
of the main problems involved in
the energy release of the atomic
bomb.
The apparatus used in the research
was the Stanford cyclotron, built on
the campus in 1940-41 with the sup
port of the Rockefeller Foundation,
the Research Corporation of New
York, and a few private donors in
the Bay Area.
Work Site Is Secret
Working with Professor Bloch
were Piofessor Staub and D. B. Nico

demus. In July 19415, the entire
Stanford croup was transferred to
the "secret." site at Los Alamos to
continue its experimental work.
Dr. Norris E. Bradbury, on leave
from the Stanford faculty since 1941
to serve with the navy, was assigned
to the Manhattan Engineer District
Project in the summer of 1944 with
the rank of commander. Security
regulations prohibit disclosure of his
personal contribution to the bomb
development.
The Stanford men present at the
bomb test were Professors Staub
and Bradbury.
Repaired Cyclotron
Professor Hansen was loaned by
Spcriy Gyroscope Company to the
University of California in the sum
mer of 1943 to investigate misbe
haviors of that group's cyclotron
apparatus believed due to electrical
oscillations. He has been on leave
from Stanford sincc 1940 to serve as
research engineer with Sperry. Dr.
Hansen returned to the campus in
July and has resumed his duties in
the Physics Department.
Prior to his present assignment,
Commander Bradbury was assistant
to the experimental officer at, the
Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgrcn,
Virginia. He had charge of experi
mental and development work in ex
terior ballistics, as well as supervis
ion of all measurements of projec
tile velocities.
Researchers' Special Fields
Before the war Dr. Bradbury had
worked on research problems in at

mospheric physics and ionization of
gases. Nuclear physics has been the
special field of interest, of Dr. Bloch
and Dr. Staub for several years.
Dr. Bloch also returned to the
campus during the summer. Dts.
Bradbury and Staub arc still at Los
Alamos but expect to rejoin the
faculty in the early future.
