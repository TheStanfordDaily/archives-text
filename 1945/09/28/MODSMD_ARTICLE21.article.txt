## EXCOM ON TRIAL A 						PLAN AND ITS PURPOSE 
### 
We were wondering Wednesday night as
we watched the people seated at the big round
table in the A.S.S.U. E>:com room just how many
of those student representatives knew about the
effort and sound thinking that has gone into
the plan for student government under which
they were elected.
Student officers elected by living group areas
wasn't an idea snatched out of the air just
because the old system of representation by
classes had collapsed completely under war
time conditions. The Stanford student body in a
referendum last spring quarter voted to change
the election method, starting spring '45, and in
corporate the new plan in a revised A.S.S.U.
constitution to be voted on in entirety spring
M 6. Excom members who outlined the change
fell that representation by living group areas
Would provide distinct advantage —in peace as
well as war time —over class representation be
cause at Stanford student opinions, activities,
and interests tend to be centered in the living
unit rather than the class. The area system of
1< presentation balances Excom by providing
acjainst election of Excom members from one
area or opinion group onW, and it was the in
tention of instigators of tne plan that repre
sentatives place themselves in contact with the
house presidents in their area, providing a
channel for free exchange of Excom issues and
student opinion.
Looking toward Stanford's post-war recon
version picture, authors of the new plan rec
ognized that living group areas would fluctuate.
The present inconsistency on Excom where the
Sequoia Hall representative has (because of Se
quoia's closing) no one to reprsent be
eisily remedied by allowing for another repre
sentative from the men's Row district, which
has increased in size and population since last
Spring; or, if qualified, the present Sequoia Hall
representative could act for the men's Row,
where some of his constituents are doubtless
now living.
Excom members are new, and some unused
io participating in student government; how
ever, more interest and enthusiasm was evi
denced in electing them to office last spring
than at many previous elections. New Excom
members know, too, that at last spring's area
representation election they were chosen by
those who know them and sincerely hope that
this Excom can lay the foundation for strong,
capable, and thoroughly representative studen
government.
