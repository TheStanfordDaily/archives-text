# "NON-FRATERNIZATION"

### 
Latest reconversion command to strike Stan
ford's smaller women's residences—the ex-sor
ority houses—apparently is a much-discussed—
hut not "official," mind you—"non-fraterniza
tion" order for hashers. According to reports of
both hashers and girls residing at the houses,
hashers are requested to enter and leave by the
rear doors, to refrain from joining the girls in
the social rooms as has been the tradition.
This worried us, for hashing at Stanford has
always been as much a social as a waiter's job.
At least in the smaller houses. Hashing is not a
matter of finance with most boys.
Miss Ricker, Director of the Dining Halls at
Hoble, Lagunita and the Union Residence, said
she has heard nothing of such an official order.
She admires Stanford's past attitude toward
hashers, a feeling of perfect equality and non
discrimination.
The only reason, she explains, that hashers at
residences under her control enter in the rear
is convenience. They are perfectly free to asso
ciat with the girls. Of course, reasonably
enough, hashers shouldn't stop and talk to girls
while serving, since it slows down the service.
Miss Doyle likewise contends there have
been no official new rules given to housemoth
ers concerning this question. She is aware of

the rumor, but denies any new orders have
been given to the individual houses.
Since University occupation, the women's
residences are run to a much greater extent
by University-employed housemothers. They
are required to jy,|g|*t»ke finances, watch the bud
get closelyT ? They also hire the hashers.
We see such a grand opportunity for contin
uation of a Stanford tradition of informality and
friendliness among hashers and the girls in
these houses that it would seem a shame if
such short-sighted, discriminatory rules were
effected. It is our hope that if such official edicts
,were issued by either administration or individ
ual houses they will be retracted or eased.—Bill
Eilers.
