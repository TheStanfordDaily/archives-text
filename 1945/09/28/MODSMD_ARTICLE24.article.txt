# AGAIN, THE NITERY
## 
### 
Now that Fall Quarter has gotten under way,
we fell it's time to call a little attention to the
Nitery. One of the Farm's oldest gathering
places, the Nitery has been a part of Stanford
life ever since 'way back when.
People seem to have forgotten lately, how
ever, that the Nitery is a place for everyone to
use and enjoy. They seem to think that just be
cause it's there it can be everyone's trash can —
or that they can just go in and raise hoopla with
out regard for others.
Unfortunately this is not so. The Nitery, just
like every place else on the Stanford campus,
deserves consideration from the people who use
it. It seems silly that Stanford students must be
reprimanded for leaving coke bottles lying on
the Nitery floor, or for leaving half empty coke
bottles around for someone else to knock over.
But it seems just as silly that Stanford students
would do these things and keep the Nitery in
the perpetual mess that it is. However, they have
done that and more.
The Nitery is dirty and unkempt becaufee 1)
Stanford students throw trash behind the coke
bar untitl it is nothing but a glorified waste
basket; 2) Stanford students give noisy little
parties there till closing hours at night, prevent
ing Union residents from studying and sleep
ing.
It doesn't take much to realize that if a little
common consideration were shown in using the
Nitery, it wouldn't be in such a disgraceful con
dition. If students would dispose of trash in the
proper receptacles, if each would put their
empty coke bottles in the stands provided, if
each of them would do their part to help keep
it clean and quiet, the Nitery would be a much
better place for all.—M.S.
