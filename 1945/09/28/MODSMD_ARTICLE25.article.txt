### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
FOREIGN MINISTER CONFERENCE
An international conference is the hope and apex
in the career of a foreign secretary, especially when
he has full say about the policy of his country. At
last he can show the unenlightened parliamentarians
who snipe at him and the cynical professionals back
at the Foreign Office something that he already knows
—namely that he is a born master of the art of state
craft.
Perhaps this is as much a basis as anything else for
the thundering verbosity coming out of London, but
there is another factor too.
RUSSIA ANI) MOLOTOV
A lot pivots about the strategy of Molotov, and the
aspirations of Russia. The trend of events in Belgium,
Greece, and the rest of the Balkans tends to show
that the first Big Three Conferences had divided
Europe into tentative spheres of influence. Russia,
flaunting the Red Army, got the lion's share.
But then something happened. President Roosevelt
died, and Truman, who is Wilsonian in many re
spects. tried to redo the shape of Europe and Asia
along more Wilsonian lines. The Indian Nationalists,
who were sidetracked under Roosevelt, got unex
pected aid from Truman. The Palestine question,
which was sidetracked in the name of Persian oil
concessions, was reopened; the State Department was
shaken up so often that it now looks more like a
malted than anything else, and the old policies in Eu
rope started to look more and more imperialistic
to the new regime.
RUSSIAN REACTION
The sudden American "to the rear, march!" began
taking on a very ugly appearance to the People's
Commisariat of Foreign Affairs. In fact, it started
thinking in terms of "double-cross." Thus Russia
implanted a firmer hand on her new satellites, and
started reorganizing her armies on the double.
But then came the blast that shook the world—
and obliterated Hiroshima. Russia learned about it
at Potsdam, and decided that, for the present, the
velvet glove over the iron diplomatic fist would
have to be thicker.
LONDON
So Molotov came to London, probably with orders
to preserve the status quo. He resorted to his usual
bag of political tricks, and he is being helped be
cause he is dealing with a group of not-overly-astute
amateurs.
His usual trick, pulled with brilliant effect at
San Francisco, is to demand more than he hopes to
get, so that the final settlement will leave him with
what he wants.
Thus Russia started out by demanding the Dar
danelles, the Dodecanese Islands, Eritrea and Libya
—in thort, everything that Britain had fought against
her having since 1820. Molotov is probably ready to
demand the Solar System as a Soviet Republic if he
thinks it will net him a free hand in the Balkans.
The idea is if everybody else says "no" in very
flat terms, Russia will scream something about capi
talistic plots, walk out, and ministries that promised
big unity will face collapse. If everybody works for
a compromise, Russia can demand what she was
promised in the beginning, and generously give up
claim to the rest, thus handing Britain and America
the prestige of a semi-diplomatic victory, and giving
Molotov the gravy.
So much for what, is happening. As for what will,
only time and that singularly uninformative insti
tution known as press communiques can tell.
