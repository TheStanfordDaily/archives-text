### STANLEY WILSON 
One thing which makes Stanford
so interesting is that there is always
a beef of some sort going on. For
example: There's an unofficial ru
mor floating around concerning a
new rule applying to hashers and
their relations with the members
of the living groups for whom they
work. The rumor has it that the
once-revered house hasher must re
frain from even a casual smile or
an innocent wink at a co-ed whom
he might be serving during the meal
hour. What's more, hashers are re
quested to enter and leave the liv
ing group through the back door.
As long as your writer has been
hashing at the Farm, he has yet to
see even the boldest hasher make'
any undue passes at house-mothers
or female still lents —during meal
hours, that is. This new edict hurts
not a few of the older boys who
have returned to school anticipating
the usual care-free, friendly at
mosphere prevalent in the houses
not too long ago.
If the women students objected to
the "buddy-buddy" situation it
would be different, but the ratio
isn't quite that high yet!
Oh well, light it out, kids; I'm
staying out of it. Fraternization or
not, I have my solution. I'm build
ing a catacomb from my residence
to my date's front lawn and I'll
make like a gopher. It'll fool every
one and I won't have to bother
showing my identification card to the
guards posted at the front door.

If you haven't read the latest book
by John (I love my bums) Stein
beck, give it a whirl. It is entitled
"Cannery Row" and carries plenty
of description, authenticity and hu
mor enough to last you until Hope's
next show. It is described as his
best effort yet, and I'm not one to
disagree.

I wrote a little about traditions
yesterday, but I fear enough has
not yet been said. According to
page 21, paragraph three, of the
Frosh Bible, Stanford students
don't smoke on Quad ... at least
that's what it says in the good
hook. Violation of this, and that
tradition of slapping down any
woman seen walking up the cov
eted Law steps, is not uncommon
these days. The war is over and it
is time to resume normal college
procedure. Normal college pro
cedure means respecting tradi
tions horn years before our time
which are sources of satisfaction
and pride to (he many grads who
have preceded us. This department
feels we must accept a certain re
sponsibility of this heritage and
not elt it he cast bv the wayside.

I suppose every house-mother has
her problems. But some have more
than others. I'm thinking about
a certain returned veteran who had
trouble seeing Dr. Sharp concern
ing a room in which to live this
quarter. Being a hopeful fellow, and
aware of the fact he had stood in
line for four hours, he decided to
independently proceed and take up
residence in his former fraternity
house. But someone had neglected
to inform him that it had been taken
over as a women's residence. He
rambled about the sleeping porch
searching for a vacant bunk, but to
no avail, so he departed still inno
cent of the crime he had committed.
Always one for a good gag, I won
der at the fellow's embarassment
had a local charm girl presented
herself in the sleeping porch, pin
curls and all.

I see by the Peninsula's most out
standing morning daily, that one
Richard - where - is-my - bird-dog-
Driscoll again will head the most
yuk-yukkish of all humor mags —
the Chaparral. Now in his 33rd con
secutive term as head man, Driscoll
is still going strong and wishes to
state that the vicious rumor con
cerning his retirement from the field
is erroneous. Speaking at a press
conference from a certain rest home
for chronic alcoholics in Southern
Mayfield, Driscoll is quoted as say
ing: "I'll produce gags that'll kill
you. Look what it's done to me."
Go get 'em, Drisc, we're behind you.
Besides, I have several quarts of
adrenlin stored away for just such
purposes.

Well, Itchy is getting itchier, and
Mrs. Mahoney is about to put the
bite on B. O.'s sparkling diamonds,
Gad, Tracy, get into the swim of
this and give us the pay-off. I'm
getting itchy waiting for your next
attractive character.

Have a good weekend, and to be
sine of a pleasant date make imme
diate reservations at the Top of the
Mark of the Southern Peninsula,
located high up on Portola Drive
. . . see ya' there.
