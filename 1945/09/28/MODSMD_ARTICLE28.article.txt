# Asiatic School Opens
## 
### 
Keeping pace with the new Atomic
Age of world peace and international
unity, Stanford's School of Humani
ties is inaugurating a new civilian |
program of Pacific-Asiatic-Russian j
studies. This course was originated
for the Farm's ASTP unit. How
ever, because of the United State's
new awareness of the Far East, the j
program now is to be a regular part
of the Stanford curriculum.
Dean Dodds Heads New School
Dean John W. Dodds of the School
of Humanities and Mr. Anthony E. |
Sokol are associate directors of the |
Pacific-Asiatic-Russian studies. The
courses of the program will pre- j
pare students for commercial, po
litical. and cultural opportunities in
the Orient. History, geography, j
political institutions, religions, and j
arts will be offered. According to
Mr. Sokol, the language classes will
emphasize the oral rather than writ
ten approach so that students will
be prepared for practical use of Rus
sian, Chinese, Japanese, and Ma
layan.
The university has been consider
ing the initiation of this new pro
gram for some time; however, a
lack of funds made its realization
seem impossible. The Rockefeller
Foundation came to Stanford's aid
with grants of money, and this quar
ter the program is open to every- |
one.
Five Scholarships Announced
As proof that the Orient also feels ;
the need of a better understanding
between the East and the West. Mr. j
Sokol told of the five cultural schol- i
arships offered by the Ministry of
Education of the National Govern- i
ment of China to American students. I
Although the School of Humani
ties is handling the administrative |
end of the program, the entire school
is cooperating in this new, far
sighted enterprise. The history, po
litical science, and language depart
ments are especially active in the ;
course. Russian books are being do
nated by the Hoover War Library.
The School of Business has an
nounced that any student who has
majored in Pacific-Asiatic-Russian |
studies will be accepted in good
standing. To date, the new program
is only an undergraduate course.
If, however, it proves to be the suc
cess that the University expects it
to be. a graduate year of study will
be added.

The opportunities arising from
tliis new program are varied, ac
cording to the directors. For many
students, it will serve as a basis for
one valid kind of liberal education.
It will give a thorough background
for students who wish to prepare
for specific positions in foreign
countries, or for other work relat
ing to those areas. Government
agencies as well as other universities
are planning such training courses.
Industrial and commercial corpora
tion with overseas interests will be
hunting for personnel with knowl
edge of the countries and peoples
concerned. The program will also
provide a sound foundation for aca
demic work leading to advanced
degrees in a number of fields.
Program Revised
When this Far Eastern study was
under Army direction, the courses
were concentrated into a very few
classes. For civilian study, however,
the program has been revised to
meet university requirements. A
staft' of about thirteen pi-ofessors has
divided the program into component
parts.
An introductory course of Far
Eastern Civilization will give stu
dents a general background as well
as explain to them the contrast be
tween the East and West. From then
on, the student will concentrate his
study into certain areas, China, Ja
pan, Russia, or Southeast Asia, and
the Pacific Islands.
Enrollment Good
Dean Dodds and Mr. Sokol are
hoping for a favorable reception of
their new program. They were
agreeably surprised this week to
find the enrollment in their language
classes far greater than they ex
pected. However, they are working
to create even more enthusiasm in
the Pacific-Asiatic-Russian studies.

If the course continues successfully,
a larger staff of teachers will be
necessary, and new courses in liter
ature, art, and economics will be
added.
In a pamphlet describing the new
program, there is a statement which
announces that it is the task of the
university to aid in the new world
concept. Stanford is leading the
schools of America in realizing the
necessity of working for our "one
world.'
Libraiy Supplements
The study of Pacific, Asiatic, and
Russian cultures and languages has
received particular emphasis at
Stanford for many years. In the
library there is an extensive col
lection of reference material relating
to these areas. In addition to this,
the Hoover Library on War, Revo
lution, and Peace has recently de
veloped several special collections
which cannot be duplicated.
This new course of study, which
arose only from a war time neces
sity, may prove to be one of the
most valuable programs at Stanford
in the near future. Due to the far
sightedness of the professors, the
university can offer another im
portant course to augment the
Farm's educational opportunities.

The study of Pacific, Asiatic, and
Russian cultures and languages has
received particular emphasis at
Stanford for many years. In the
library there is an extensive col
lection of reference material relating
to these areas. In addition to this,
the Hoover Library on War, Revo
lution, and Peace has recently de
veloped several special collections
which cannot be duplicated.
This new course of study, which
arose only from a war time neces
sity, may prove to be one of the
most valuable programs at Stanford
in the near future. Due to the far
sightedness of the professors, the
university can offer another im
portant course to augment the
Farm's educational opportunities.

In future years, Stanford, as well
as the rest of the United States, will
participate in the interest which the
world now has in the Far East.
Keeping pace with the new Atomic
Age of world peace and international
unity, Stanford's School of Humani
ties is inaugurating a new civilian |
program of Pacific-Asiatic-Russian j
studies. This course was originated
for the Farm's ASTP unit. How
ever, because of the United State's
new awareness of the Far East, the j
program now is to be a regular part
of the Stanford curriculum.
Dean Dodds Heads New School
Dean John W. Dodds of the School
of Humanities and Mr. Anthony E. |
Sokol are associate directors of the |
Pacific-Asiatic-Russian studies. The
courses of the program will pre- j
pare students for commercial, po
litical. and cultural opportunities in
the Orient. History, geography, j
political institutions, religions, and j
arts will be offered. According to
Mr. Sokol, the language classes will
emphasize the oral rather than writ
ten approach so that students will
be prepared for practical use of Rus
sian, Chinese, Japanese, and Ma
layan.
The university has been consider
ing the initiation of this new pro
gram for some time; however, a
lack of funds made its realization
seem impossible. The Rockefeller
Foundation came to Stanford's aid
with grants of money, and this quar
ter the program is open to every- |
one.
Five Scholarships Announced
As proof that the Orient also feels ;
the need of a better understanding
between the East and the West. Mr. j
Sokol told of the five cultural schol- i
arships offered by the Ministry of
Education of the National Govern- i
ment of China to American students. I
Although the School of Humani
ties is handling the administrative |
end of the program, the entire school
is cooperating in this new, far
sighted enterprise. The history, po
litical science, and language depart
ments are especially active in the ;
course. Russian books are being do
nated by the Hoover War Library.
The School of Business has an
nounced that any student who has
majored in Pacific-Asiatic-Russian |
studies will be accepted in good
standing. To date, the new program
is only an undergraduate course.
If, however, it proves to be the suc
cess that the University expects it
to be. a graduate year of study will
be added.

The opportunities arising from
tliis new program are varied, ac
cording to the directors. For many
students, it will serve as a basis for
one valid kind of liberal education.
It will give a thorough background
for students who wish to prepare
for specific positions in foreign
countries, or for other work relat
ing to those areas. Government
agencies as well as other universities
are planning such training courses.
Industrial and commercial corpora
tion with overseas interests will be
hunting for personnel with knowl
edge of the countries and peoples
concerned. The program will also
provide a sound foundation for aca
demic work leading to advanced
degrees in a number of fields.
Program Revised
When this Far Eastern study was
under Army direction, the courses
were concentrated into a very few
classes. For civilian study, however,
the program has been revised to
meet university requirements. A
staft' of about thirteen pi-ofessors has
divided the program into component
parts.
An introductory course of Far
Eastern Civilization will give stu
dents a general background as well
as explain to them the contrast be
tween the East and West. From then
on, the student will concentrate his
study into certain areas, China, Ja
pan, Russia, or Southeast Asia, and
the Pacific Islands.
Enrollment Good
Dean Dodds and Mr. Sokol are
hoping for a favorable reception of
their new program. They were
agreeably surprised this week to
find the enrollment in their language
classes far greater than they ex
pected. However, they are working
to create even more enthusiasm in
the Pacific-Asiatic-Russian studies.

If the course continues successfully,
a larger staff of teachers will be
necessary, and new courses in liter
ature, art, and economics will be
added.
In a pamphlet describing the new
program, there is a statement which
announces that it is the task of the
university to aid in the new world
concept. Stanford is leading the
schools of America in realizing the

under Army direction, the courses
were concentrated into a very few
classes. For civilian study, however,
the program has been revised to
meet university requirements. A
staft' of about thirteen pi-ofessors has
divided the program into component
parts.
An introductory course of Far
Eastern Civilization will give stu
dents a general background as well
as explain to them the contrast be
tween the East and West. From then
on, the student will concentrate his
study into certain areas, China, Ja
pan, Russia, or Southeast Asia, and
the Pacific Islands.
Enrollment Good
Dean Dodds and Mr. Sokol are
hoping for a favorable reception of
their new program. They were
agreeably surprised this week to
find the enrollment in their language
classes far greater than they ex
pected. However, they are working
to create even more enthusiasm in
the Pacific-Asiatic-Russian studies.

If the course continues successfully,
a larger staff of teachers will be
necessary, and new courses in liter
ature, art, and economics will be
added.
In a pamphlet describing the new
program, there is a statement which
announces that it is the task of the
university to aid in the new world
concept. Stanford is leading the
schools of America in realizing the
necessity of working for our "one
world.'

The study of Pacific, Asiatic, and
Russian cultures and languages has
received particular emphasis at
Stanford for many years. In the
library there is an extensive col
lection of reference material relating
to these areas. In addition to this,
the Hoover Library on War, Revo
lution, and Peace has recently de
veloped several special collections
which cannot be duplicated.
This new course of study, which
arose only from a war time neces
sity, may prove to be one of the
most valuable programs at Stanford
in the near future. Due to the far
sightedness of the professors, the
university can offer another im
portant course to augment the
Farm's educational opportunities.

A list of some of the staff par
ticipating in (he new program is as

Buck, Shau Wing Chan, George B.
Cressey, Harold H. Fisher, Felix M.
Keesing, Henry Lanz, John W. Mas
land, Anatole G. Mazour, Merrill
Spalding, Frederic Spiegelberg, and
language teachers.
In future years, Stanford, as well
as the rest of the United States, will
participate in the interest which the
world now has in the Far East.
Keeping pace with the new Atomic
Age of world peace and international
unity, Stanford's School of Humani
ties is inaugurating a new civilian |
program of Pacific-Asiatic-Russian j
studies. This course was originated
for the Farm's ASTP unit. How
ever, because of the United State's
new awareness of the Far East, the j
program now is to be a regular part
of the Stanford curriculum.
Dean Dodds Heads New School
Dean John W. Dodds of the School
of Humanities and Mr. Anthony E. |
Sokol are associate directors of the |
Pacific-Asiatic-Russian studies. The
courses of the program will pre- j
pare students for commercial, po
litical. and cultural opportunities in
the Orient. History, geography, j
political institutions, religions, and j
arts will be offered. According to
Mr. Sokol, the language classes will
emphasize the oral rather than writ
ten approach so that students will
be prepared for practical use of Rus
sian, Chinese, Japanese, and Ma
layan.
The university has been consider
ing the initiation of this new pro
gram for some time; however, a
lack of funds made its realization
seem impossible. The Rockefeller
Foundation came to Stanford's aid
with grants of money, and this quar
ter the program is open to every- |
one.
Five Scholarships Announced
As proof that the Orient also feels ;
the need of a better understanding
between the East and the West. Mr. j
Sokol told of the five cultural schol- i
arships offered by the Ministry of
Education of the National Govern- i
ment of China to American students. I
Although the School of Humani
ties is handling the administrative |
end of the program, the entire school
is cooperating in this new, far
sighted enterprise. The history, po
litical science, and language depart
ments are especially active in the ;
course. Russian books are being do
nated by the Hoover War Library.
The School of Business has an
nounced that any student who has
majored in Pacific-Asiatic-Russian |
studies will be accepted in good
standing. To date, the new program
is only an undergraduate course.
If, however, it proves to be the suc
cess that the University expects it
to be. a graduate year of study will
be added.

The opportunities arising from
tliis new program are varied, ac
cording to the directors. For many
students, it will serve as a basis for
one valid kind of liberal education.
It will give a thorough background
for students who wish to prepare
for specific positions in foreign
countries, or for other work relat
ing to those areas. Government
agencies as well as other universities
are planning such training courses.
Industrial and commercial corpora
tion with overseas interests will be
hunting for personnel with knowl
edge of the countries and peoples
concerned. The program will also
provide a sound foundation for aca
demic work leading to advanced
degrees in a number of fields.
