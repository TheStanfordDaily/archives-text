### ART LEVINSON 
College football is in full swing
this week-end. The nation's most
potent point-makers, Army and
Navy, open their grid schedules
against comparatively weak teams.
Navy collides with the Clippers of
Villanova, and Earl Blaik's West
Pointers clash with an aggregation
that goes by the name of the Air
Force Personnel Distribution Com
mand.
Lou Little brings out his Colum
bia Lions for their season debut
against Lafayette. Another top
game in the East is Holy Cross and
Dartmouth. The Temple Owls com
pete against the boys from Syracuse,
a game which will prove most in
teresting.
A mid-Western gigantic will
feature Notre Dame and Illinois.
The Illini played a spirited game
against Clark Shaugnessey's Pitts
burgh youngsters, but Notre Dame
looks like the top team. Every
year the Irish uncork a player of
All-American caliber, and this
year should prove no exception.
Other games to follow are Purdue
and Gieat Lakes; Oklahoma and
Nebraska; and Indiana against
Northwestern.
Football on the Farm
The question of the hour at Stan
ford University is whether a foot
ball team will be fielded on the
Farm this year. Fifty grid aspirants
have expressed their willingness to
compete in collegiate football, but
it takes more than a will to put a
team on the field able to take on
any comer.
Marchmont Schwartz pulls in next
week, and from reliable comment
among compatriots in the Physical
Education department, he plans to
hold no more than a glorified spring
practice. Scrimmage against outfits
in the bay area might be arranged,
but absolutely nothing more than
that. When one stops to realize
that all other teams have started
grid play already, which means
about two months of practice be
hind that, a wet towel dampens all
exuberant hopes that a Big Game
might be witnessed this year.
Railbird Pickings
Had a chat with Three-to-Five
Jones, a gent of great repute in the
Horse and Handbook set, and he
told us that Bucket Brigade is ready
for a terrific rate at Holly Park.
Jones also said that Muligataway
bears watching.
Jones is very saddened by the fact
that horse owner moguls aren't en
tering their bread-winners at the
smaller plants, but are only running
them at Santa Anita and Holly Park.
Del Mar and Bay Meadows are now
contenting themselves with second
rate nags.

told us that Bucket Brigade is ready
for a terrific rate at Holly Park.
Jones also said that Muligataway
bears watching.
Jones is very saddened by the fact
that horse owner moguls aren't en
tering their bread-winners at the
smaller plants, but are only running
them at Santa Anita and Holly Park.
Del Mar and Bay Meadows are now
contenting themselves with second
rate nags.

. . . "third straight season?"
College football is in full swing
this week-end. The nation's most
potent point-makers, Army and
Navy, open their grid schedules
against comparatively weak teams.
Navy collides with the Clippers of
Villanova, and Earl Blaik's West
Pointers clash with an aggregation
that goes by the name of the Air
Force Personnel Distribution Com
mand.
Lou Little brings out his Colum
bia Lions for their season debut
against Lafayette. Another top
game in the East is Holy Cross and
Dartmouth. The Temple Owls com
pete against the boys from Syracuse,
a game which will prove most in
teresting.
A mid-Western gigantic will
feature Notre Dame and Illinois.
The Illini played a spirited game
against Clark Shaugnessey's Pitts
burgh youngsters, but Notre Dame
looks like the top team. Every
year the Irish uncork a player of
All-American caliber, and this
year should prove no exception.
Other games to follow are Purdue
and Gieat Lakes; Oklahoma and
Nebraska; and Indiana against
Northwestern.
Football on the Farm
The question of the hour at Stan
ford University is whether a foot
ball team will be fielded on the
Farm this year. Fifty grid aspirants
have expressed their willingness to
compete in collegiate football, but
it takes more than a will to put a
team on the field able to take on
any comer.
Marchmont Schwartz pulls in next
week, and from reliable comment
among compatriots in the Physical
Education department, he plans to
hold no more than a glorified spring
practice. Scrimmage against outfits
in the bay area might be arranged,
but absolutely nothing more than
that. When one stops to realize
that all other teams have started
grid play already, which means
about two months of practice be
hind that, a wet towel dampens all
exuberant hopes that a Big Game
might be witnessed this year.
Railbird Pickings
Had a chat with Three-to-Five
Jones, a gent of great repute in the
Horse and Handbook set, and he
told us that Bucket Brigade is ready
for a terrific rate at Holly Park.
