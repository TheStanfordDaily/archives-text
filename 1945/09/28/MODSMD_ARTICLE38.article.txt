# Troy Favored Over Bears
## 
### BOB SLOBE Daily Sports Editor 
The outcome of (he California-
U.S.C. tilt this Saturday will give a
fair indication of the possibility of
the Trojans copping the coast con
ference championship for the third
straight year. The Bears are going
to experience great difficulty trying
to hold down the speedy Trojan
backfield and trying to push through
a line that averages 209 pounds.
Coach Jeff Cravath has a top
notch eleven this year. His first
string has five veterans on it, all
lettermen from previous years. His
backfield may well be compared to
the Illini's "stop watch" backfield
of last year for they have speed
to burn. Quarterback Verl Lilly
white and Right Half Ted Tannehill
are both 10.1 men in the 100 yard
dash; Left Half Bobby Morris is a
24 seconds flat sprinter in the low
hurdles and Left Half Joe Scott
placed third in the low hurdles
event in the AAU National track"
meet this summer.
Lillywhite and Jerry Bowman,
1940 lettermen recently discharged
from the Army Air Corps, are both
adept passers and have able receiv
ers in Captain Jim Callanan, All
Coast end, Harry McKinney and
Harry Adelman, veteran ends.
Calilornia while having an able
coach in Lawrence "Buck" Shaw,
does not have much to work with,
and their line will be heavily out
weighed although not the 20 pounds

per man that U.S.C. outweighed
U.C.L.A. in their contest last week.
Standout for Cal will probably be
Bob Edmonston, rather mediocre
back from last year, and Chuck
Gilkey, who receives honorable men
tion because he is the cousin of one
of our former sports writers and
because he can pass a little bit.
I'm afraid we're inclined to agree
with Coach Shaw when he says,
'The odds will be far from even."
U.S.C. by at least 10 points.
In the North our writers disagree
somewhat as to the outcome of the

Oregon-Washington. The return of j
Jake Leicht to the Duck lineup has
swung Jim Welter and myself over !
to the Oregon side of the register,
whereas the fact that Washington
definitely has a more potent squad
has kept Art Levinson and A 1 Sci
aroni firm for the Huskies. The
game will be good and close.
We look for Washington State to j
trample Idaho and Oregon State to
edge out Camp Beale, but this early j
in the season anything could happen i
and probably will.
In other games on the coast j
"Daily" favorites will be Fleet City J
over the El Toro Marines, San Diego
Naval Training Station over the
Bruins of U.C.L.A. and St. Mary's j
over the Stockton Commandos if
Herm Wedemeyer is in the lineup
for most of the game.

We look for Washington State to j
trample Idaho and Oregon State to
edge out Camp Beale, but this early j
in the season anything could happen i
and probably will.
In other games on the coast j
"Daily" favorites will be Fleet City J
over the El Toro Marines, San Diego
Naval Training Station over the
Bruins of U.C.L.A. and St. Mary's j
over the Stockton Commandos if
Herm Wedemeyer is in the lineup
for most of the game.


BUCK" SHAW. Bear Coach . . . j
"odds are far from even."
The outcome of (he California-
U.S.C. tilt this Saturday will give a
fair indication of the possibility of
the Trojans copping the coast con
ference championship for the third
straight year. The Bears are going
to experience great difficulty trying
to hold down the speedy Trojan
backfield and trying to push through
a line that averages 209 pounds.
Coach Jeff Cravath has a top
notch eleven this year. His first
string has five veterans on it, all
lettermen from previous years. His
backfield may well be compared to
the Illini's "stop watch" backfield
of last year for they have speed
to burn. Quarterback Verl Lilly
white and Right Half Ted Tannehill
are both 10.1 men in the 100 yard
dash; Left Half Bobby Morris is a
24 seconds flat sprinter in the low
hurdles and Left Half Joe Scott
placed third in the low hurdles
event in the AAU National track"
meet this summer.
Lillywhite and Jerry Bowman,
1940 lettermen recently discharged
from the Army Air Corps, are both
adept passers and have able receiv
ers in Captain Jim Callanan, All
Coast end, Harry McKinney and
Harry Adelman, veteran ends.
Calilornia while having an able
coach in Lawrence "Buck" Shaw,
does not have much to work with,
and their line will be heavily out
weighed although not the 20 pounds

per man that U.S.C. outweighed
U.C.L.A. in their contest last week.
Standout for Cal will probably be
Bob Edmonston, rather mediocre
back from last year, and Chuck
Gilkey, who receives honorable men
tion because he is the cousin of one
of our former sports writers and
because he can pass a little bit.
I'm afraid we're inclined to agree
with Coach Shaw when he says,
'The odds will be far from even."
U.S.C. by at least 10 points.
In the North our writers disagree
somewhat as to the outcome of the

Oregon-Washington. The return of j
Jake Leicht to the Duck lineup has
swung Jim Welter and myself over !
to the Oregon side of the register,
whereas the fact that Washington
definitely has a more potent squad
has kept Art Levinson and A 1 Sci
aroni firm for the Huskies. The
game will be good and close.
