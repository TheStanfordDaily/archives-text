# Compensation Bill Vetoed by Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (UP).â€”
President Truman clashed with
Congress today for the first time,
asserting that the Senate had "let
him down" on the unemployment
compensation bill and serving blunt
notice that he expects an apparently
unwilling House to come to his res
cue.
Standing firm against his first
congressional rebuff, the President
said emphatically that he is stick
ing to his original request for max
imum payments of $25 a week for
26 weeks, summoned to the White
House to hear his views, Demo
cratic members of the House Ways
and Means Committee gave no in
dication that they intend to go to
bat for him.
The committee voted 14-10 Tues
day to shelve even the watered
down jobless pay bill passed by the
Senate. Four of the votes to drop
it were cast by Democrats.
According to Presidential Secre
tary Charles G. Ross, Mr. Truman
told the 12 Democratic committee
men that his former Senate col
leagues had let him down, and that
he expected the House not to do
likewise. He reportedly told them
also that the late President Roose
velt relied heavily upon the House
in legislative battles and that he
hoped the House would swing the
tide again.
