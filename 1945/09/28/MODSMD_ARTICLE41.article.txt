# Peacetime R.O.T.C. Planned by Army
## 
### 
For the benefit of those students
planning to enroll at Stanford for
their initial term who are interested
in obtaining commissions in the
Officers' Reserve Corps through the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
this statement is published relative
to the status of the Army ROTC.
The four-year ROTC course re
quired for qualification for a com
mission in the Officers' Reserve
Corps is divided into two sub
courses —basic and advanced — of
I wo years each. The basic course
normally is completed in the Fresh
man and Sophomore years as a pre
requisite for the advanced course,
which normally corresponds to the
student's Junior and Senior aca
demic years.
Pre-War Organization
Pnoi to the war the ROTC at
Stanford was organized in three
units —a Field Artillery Unit, an
Ordnance Unit and a Quartermaster
Corps Unit. Successful completion
of the four-year course in the cur
ricula of one of these specialized

units qualified a student for a com
mission in that branch of the army
represented by the unit in which he
was enrolled.
Shortly after war was declared,
the War Department announced the
suspension of the advanced course.
The announcement stated that after
the war this upper division course
would be resumed. Last spring it
was again stated officially that there
are plans for a post-war ROTC that
will afford a student the opportunity
to qualify for a commission while
obtaining this academic degree.
At the time the advanced course
was inactivated, the War Depart
ment issued instructions under
which the curricula of the several
branches of the army were consoli
dated into one two-year basic
course curriculum covering sub
jects of value in all the branches.
Since then this course—termed
"Branch Immaterial"—has been the
only army ROTC course available
in tha colleges and universities of
the United States. Unless modifying
instructions are received between
now and then, it will be the only
course for which students may reg
ister at Stanford for the term open
ing on September 24th.
Post-War Plans
When the War Department an
nounces its post-war ROTC plans,
it is expected that not only will the
entire four-year ROTC course—re
quired for qualification for a com
mission in the Officers' Reserve
Corps—be resumed, but also that
provision will be made for both
basic and advanced courses in the
various branches of the army.
For the present, entering fresh
men without active duty in one of
the armed services who are inter
ested in qualifying for commissions
in one of the branches of the army
are advised to consider enrollment
for the Branch Immaterial basic
coures. Most who fail to do so prob
ably would disqualify themselves
for the advanced course when it is
resumed, since under pre-war reg
ulations completion of a two-year
basic course was required for ad
mission to the advanced course.
There also was a stipulation that
students entering the advanced
course must at the time have a
prospective two years of university
work ahead of them.
Freshmen, Too
Entering students this fall, includ
ing f;eshmen, providing they have
had one year of active duty in one
of the armed services, if interested
in a commission, probably will want

to await the resumption of the ad
vanced course at Stanford before
enrolling in the ROTC. Under the
Act of Congress passed last June
such service may be credited, in
lieu of the basic ROTC course, for
admission to the advanced course.
The Act of Congress referred to is
quoted, as follows:
Be il enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the
United States of America In Con
gress assembled, That section 47c of
the National Defense Act of June
3, 1916, as amended be, and the same
is hereby, amended by adding there
to the following additional provisio:
"Provided further, That under such
regulations as the Secretary of War
may prescribe any student now or
hereafter enrolled in the senior di
vision of the Reserve Officers' Train
ing Corps may receive credit to
ward completion of the two aca
demic years of service in that di
vision required for admission to the
advanced course and for entitle
ment to commutation of subsistence,
as provided above, for military
training which he has received
while on active duty in the Army,
Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard,
or while pursuing a course of in
struction in the Naval Reserve Offi
cers' Training Corps, when such
military training is substantially
equivalent to that prescribed by reg
ulations for admission to the ad
vanced course."
No War Service
Entering freshmen or sophomores
who have had no war service, but
who have successfully completed a
junior division ROTC course in a
high school may receive crcdit at the
univeisity for the first year of its
basic course. They may enroll in
itially in the second year of the
bhsic course.
If a sufficient number of students
enroll in the basic (Branch Imma
terial) course, an effort will be made
to set up for them a schedule for
classes and drills on week days oth
er than Saturday, since it is appreci
ated many students desire to have
that day free for visits at home and
other non-academic activities.
Students interested in ROTC en
rollment are advised to see the
Commandant or his Secretary at
Military Headquarters in the Physic
al Education Building.
