Research concerning the problems
of inter-personal relationships be
tween physically injured people
(orthopedic and plastic surgery
cases) and their associates: family
members, friends, and strangers, was
startea at Stanford in February,
sponsored by the Department of
Psychology. Emphasis is being
placed upon war-connected handi
caps.
The investigation deals with the
attitude and behavior of the injured
to the non-injured person and of the
non-injured toward the injured one
â€”leading to mutual social psycho
logical adjustment or hindering it.
