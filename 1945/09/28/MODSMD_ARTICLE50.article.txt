# Farm Football Anybody's Guess...

This is strictly on the Q.T. so
keep it just between us. You want
to know where Stanford stands in
the football picture? If this were
next Tuesday Marchie Schwartz
would be on campus and we could
ford realized that many vets would
day and nobody knows nothin'. All
we can pass on is what has hap
pened so far and a little bit about
who thinks what's going to happen
when.
All last Spring the football sit
uation was up in the air. Offi
cially Stanford had announced that
the University would not have a
football team until V-J Day; but
the rumors were being slung
around that Stanford was about
to abandon it's wartime athletic
policy. Bill Lciser of the San
Francisco Chronicle exploded a
keg of dynamite with his story
that the NROTC was coming to
Stanford in July and that would
set the Indians up for the '45
season. Nobody denied the rumor
but nobody approved it cither.

Then in the late Spring Washing
ton announced officially that the
NROTC training would not start at
the various schools then being se
lected until November 1 because
the piogram had become tangled
up in congressional red tape.
In June an Associated Press dis
patch listed Stanford as one of the
schools selected for the NROTC.
But the navy wasn't arriving until
November 1, too late for the foot
ball season. The administration
took all this into consideration and
then issued a statement that ath
letics would not return to the camp
us until winter quarter 1946.
Boom! Boom! V-J Day. Stan
ford realized that many vets would
he returning autumn quarter hut
were there enough lo put out a
football team? And besides where
was Marchie Schwartz? Some
where in the Middle West. Chances
for any kind of a squad were dim
1 and once again it looked like
football would have to wait to
'46.

Then last Saturday California
played St. Mary's and drew 80,-
<100 into Memorial Stadium; 62,-
000 saw service clubs play at
Kezar; and!) 0,000 watched the
Trojans hat UCLA around in Los
Angeles. It was obvious that foot
hall was in for bigger attendances
than it had enjoyed for a long
time. The peacetime sports boom
we had heard so much about was
here. And Stanford Stadium,
which seats 90,000, was empty.
Registration followed last Mon
day and the reg figures were higher
than anybody imagined. The long
line oi vets in the ad looked like
good tootball material.
Tuesday the Daily ran a state
ment by ASSU President Kennedy
which read, "Do you want a foot
ball team this year? We can have
one ll you want it. When Coach
Marchie Schwartz issues his call for
a turnout let every Stanford man
' respond." All hell broke loose.
Now here it is Friday. Sixty
one men have signed up with

football assistant "Rusky" Hunt
t« bo on hand Tuesday when
Marchie shows up. Looking over
the list »112 signups it looks like a
big list of eager, inexperienced
kids, that could have a good time
kicking the pigskin around for
Stanford.
Nobody knows whether Marchie
will want to try to get together a
team this late in the fall. To put
together any kind of a team
would take until at least the Ist
of November.
Ana about a schedule. Most of
the coast teams have their schedules
brimming full. The word is that it
would be informal schedule. Now
what does informal mean? Does it
mean the University of California
and St. Mary's and Southern Cali
fornia or who does it mean?
Marchie will be here Tuesday, and
Wednesday the Daily will let you
know whether to make that big
game date or not. Better not get
reservations at the St.. Francis,
though, they might not let you cancel
them

next Tuesday Marchie Schwartz
would be on campus and we could
ford realized that many vets would
day and nobody knows nothin'. All
we can pass on is what has hap
pened so far and a little bit about
who thinks what's going to happen
when.
All last Spring the football sit
uation was up in the air. Offi
cially Stanford had announced that
the University would not have a
football team until V-J Day; but
the rumors were being slung
around that Stanford was about
to abandon it's wartime athletic
policy. Bill Lciser of the San
Francisco Chronicle exploded a
keg of dynamite with his story
that the NROTC was coming to
Stanford in July and that would
set the Indians up for the '45
season. Nobody denied the rumor
but nobody approved it cither.

Then in the late Spring Washing
ton announced officially that the
NROTC training would not start at
the various schools then being se
lected until November 1 because
the piogram had become tangled
up in congressional red tape.
In June an Associated Press dis
patch listed Stanford as one of the
schools selected for the NROTC.
But the navy wasn't arriving until
November 1, too late for the foot
ball season. The administration
took all this into consideration and
then issued a statement that ath
letics would not return to the camp
us until winter quarter 1946.
Boom! Boom! V-J Day. Stan
ford realized that many vets would
he returning autumn quarter hut
were there enough lo put out a
football team? And besides where
was Marchie Schwartz? Some
where in the Middle West. Chances
for any kind of a squad were dim
1 and once again it looked like
football would have to wait to
'46.

Then last Saturday California
played St. Mary's and drew 80,-
<100 into Memorial Stadium; 62,-
000 saw service clubs play at
Kezar; and!) 0,000 watched the
Trojans hat UCLA around in Los
Angeles. It was obvious that foot
hall was in for bigger attendances
than it had enjoyed for a long
time. The peacetime sports boom
we had heard so much about was
here. And Stanford Stadium,
which seats 90,000, was empty.
Registration followed last Mon
day and the reg figures were higher
than anybody imagined. The long
line oi vets in the ad looked like
good tootball material.
Tuesday the Daily ran a state
ment by ASSU President Kennedy
which read, "Do you want a foot
ball team this year? We can have
one ll you want it. When Coach
Marchie Schwartz issues his call for
a turnout let every Stanford man
' respond." All hell broke loose.
Now here it is Friday. Sixty
one men have signed up with

football assistant "Rusky" Hunt
t« bo on hand Tuesday when
Marchie shows up. Looking over
the list »112 signups it looks like a
big list of eager, inexperienced
kids, that could have a good time
kicking the pigskin around for
Stanford.
Nobody knows whether Marchie
will want to try to get together a
team this late in the fall. To put
together any kind of a team
would take until at least the Ist
of November.
Ana about a schedule. Most of
the coast teams have their schedules
brimming full. The word is that it
would be informal schedule. Now
what does informal mean? Does it
mean the University of California
and St. Mary's and Southern Cali
fornia or who does it mean?
Marchie will be here Tuesday, and
Wednesday the Daily will let you
know whether to make that big
game date or not. Better not get
reservations at the St.. Francis,
though, they might not let you cancel
them
This is strictly on the Q.T. so
keep it just between us. You want
to know where Stanford stands in
the football picture? If this were
next Tuesday Marchie Schwartz
would be on campus and we could
ford realized that many vets would
day and nobody knows nothin'. All
