area representation see page 2.)
Stanford students are represented in their
student government this year by a member of
the A.S.S.U. Executive Committee whom they
elected from their living group units. Previ
ously they'were represented on the basis of
their class.
This change, the most drastic under the new
j constitution, was brought about when war con
ditions emphasized the lack of communication
between student officers and the general stu
dent body. Area representation calls for a dis
tribution of representatives throughout the
campus and off-campus living area.
Because a more precise representation is j
given, the plan is less flexible than the class
representative system, as illustrated by the
sudden closing of an emergency voting area, :
Seguoia Hall, which elected a representative last
spring, who now represents no one.
Assuming that the Seguoia area will be re
moved under the emergency clause which cre
ated it, the area plan may be said to provide for
flexibility, though reguiring greater watchful
ness in its maintenance.
Up to the adoption of representatives from
living group areas, all Stanford students were
represented by a man and a woman elected
from each class. During the war ihis was re
duced to a man and a woman from upper and
lower division.

The 1944-45 year found representation badly
out of balance with practically all elected offi
cers coming from a small area, and the area
system was voted for use this year by an over
whelming 3 to 1 vote of the student body.
Opposition to the system was not vocal and
seemed to offer mainly the argument that the
war period would make the plan too difficult
to work and that consideration of it should be
postponed until after the war.
Support for the plan was based on the con
tention that it gave greater and fairer represen
tation in view of the fact that interests and ac
tivities at Stanford spring largely from the cir
cumsance that the overwhelming percentage
of students live on the campus and understand
problems of their group best. This is not so in
dost other universities where class representa
tion works more satisfactorily.
Easy contact to the students' representative
on the policy-making Executive ommittee is
the aim of the new system. Your representa
tive is one of the following: Lorraine Streblow,
graduate students; Bill Borthwick, graduate
men; Shirley Sneath, women in Row district;
Frank DeLisle, men in Row district; Gloria An
derson, Lagunita district; Jeanne Wallace, Union
Unit women; and Betty Wallington, non-area
representative of last year's freshmen, to advise
student officers of Branner.
Each of these members attend the meetings
of house presidents within the districts who
serve as links between the students and their
top officers.
