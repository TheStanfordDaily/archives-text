# General MacArthur's Men Seize Japanese Banks In New Finance Crackdown
## U.S. Forces Seek to Smash Pipelines Of Foreign Tribute and Assets; Measures to Tie Up A Billion Dollars 
### 
TOKYO, Sept. 30.—(UP). —Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur, smashing the fi
nancial pipeline by which the Japanese bled riches from their conquered
territories, today seized 29 Japanese overseas banks and development
companies organized for exploitation of foreign lands.
The blow struck at one of the main sources of Emperor Hirohito's vast
imperial fortune, which includes huge shares of the seized institutions.
Combined wartime assets of the 29 * ~

institutions totaled 20,000.000,000 Yen
which at the occupation rate of 15
yen to the dollar wouM be $1,333,-
000,000.
Representatives of the Japanese
finance ministry were summoned to
Mac Arthur's headquarters in down
town Tokyo at 3:45 p. m. At 4
p. m. they were handed an Allied
directive ordering their operations
frozen.
Since it was Sunday, all the in
stitutions were closed and thfe seiz
ure was effected quickly and quiet
ly-
The directive handed to the Jap
anese by Col. R. C. Kramer, chief j
of Mac Arthur's economic and scien
tific section, specified that all rec
ords not on the premises must be
turned over to the Allies.
Investigation of the records, which I
may continue for months, is ex
pected to furnish answers to these
four great mysteries.
1. What happened to the gold re
serves, currency, and other financial
assets seized in the Philippines.
2. What happened to the huge
bullion stores and treasures of the
late Chang Tso-Lin, war lord of
Manchuria, and his son, Marshal
Chang Hsueh Liang, who now is
under "soft detention" in China.
3. The extent of graft by lead
ing Japanese militarists, such as
Gen. Hideki Tojo and the military
governors of overseas areas like
Malaya and Burma.
4. The truthfulness of such old
storie.s as the Japanese army seiz
ure of the Chinese imperial bul
lion stores from Peiping during re
lief oI the Boxer siege of 1900.
