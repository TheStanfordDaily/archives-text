## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
Willi the idea to present, the dan
gers of prejudice especially against
minorities, a new book, "One Na
tion," has just been published by
Stanford Acting Professor Wallace
Stegner, who is here this quarter
etaching a course in the study of
English and American novelists.
"One Nation" deals with preju
dices in America against Negroes,
Catholics and Jews. The book is a
popularized work, written for the
layman, with the ultimate aim to
make him more tolerant. Mr. Steg
ner's book was written in co-opera
tion with the book department of
Look magazine, which provided the
picture.
Compares West lo East
Mr. Stegner came to Stanford
this quarter from Harvard Uni
versity, where he has been teaching.
In comparing Stanford to Eastern
universities Mr. Stegner said that
one important point was the coedu
cational system, which he simil
ingly termed "good."
Also there is the less formal at

mosphere evident everywhere, al
though the author could not say
yet whether or not he found Stan
ford more democratic. "Harvard,"
he said, "learned to become demo
cratic during the war years."
No Accents
"It's pleasant to be out of the
area of accent," he smiled, "for
Californians have no accent at all."
West Coast speech is probably the
purest in the country, Mr. Stegner
observed.
"I like to teach people to write,
but one must have a certain kind
of mind before he can play with
words," the author said when asked
about teaching other courses here.
He hopes to have a writing course
1 next quarter, when membership
will be limited to small numbers |
j to insure more individual assist- |
I ance.
Imitation Difficult
"Teaching writing is essentially a j
I negative job," he observed, "for the j
only help a teacher can give is by ,
telling the student what not to do. j
Some students have technique but i
' nothing to write about. Imitation !

of another author is hard to do suc
cessfully," he said.
Mr. Stegner smiled when he said
that it was much "safer" for au
thors to place their novels in fa
miliar communities or sections of
the country—preferably where they
have lived. Characters are an ac
cumulation of personalities they
have known.
Novels Listed
In practice with this theory, Mr.
Stegner's first novel was "Remem
bering Laughter" in 1937, which won
a short novel prize. He termed this
work "Calvinistic," with a Mid-
Western setting. Other novels arc
"The Potter's House" and "On a
Darkening Plain," which has its set
ting in Canada where the author
lived as a child. "Mormon Country"
is non-fiction, and his other works
are "Fire and Ice" and"The Big
Rock Candy Mountain."
At present Mr. Stegner is work
ing on a biography of John Westley
Powell, who was an explorer of the
Colorado River. He and Mrs. Steg
ner are West Coast editors of
Houghton-Mifflin.

In comparing Stanford to Eastern
universities Mr. Stegner said that
one important point was the coedu
cational system, which he simil
ingly termed "good."
Also there is the less formal at

mosphere evident everywhere, al
though the author could not say
yet whether or not he found Stan
ford more democratic. "Harvard,"
he said, "learned to become demo
cratic during the war years."
No Accents
"It's pleasant to be out of the
area of accent," he smiled, "for
Californians have no accent at all."
West Coast speech is probably the
purest in the country, Mr. Stegner
observed.
"I like to teach people to write,
but one must have a certain kind
of mind before he can play with
words," the author said when asked
about teaching other courses here.
He hopes to have a writing course
1 next quarter, when membership
will be limited to small numbers |
j to insure more individual assist- |
I ance.
Imitation Difficult
"Teaching writing is essentially a j
I negative job," he observed, "for the j
only help a teacher can give is by ,
telling the student what not to do. j
Some students have technique but i
' nothing to write about. Imitation !

of another author is hard to do suc
cessfully," he said.
Mr. Stegner smiled when he said
that it was much "safer" for au
thors to place their novels in fa
miliar communities or sections of
the country—preferably where they
have lived. Characters are an ac
cumulation of personalities they
have known.
Novels Listed
In practice with this theory, Mr.
Stegner's first novel was "Remem
bering Laughter" in 1937, which won
a short novel prize. He termed this
work "Calvinistic," with a Mid-
Western setting. Other novels arc
"The Potter's House" and "On a
Darkening Plain," which has its set
ting in Canada where the author
lived as a child. "Mormon Country"
is non-fiction, and his other works
are "Fire and Ice" and"The Big
Rock Candy Mountain."
At present Mr. Stegner is work
ing on a biography of John Westley
Powell, who was an explorer of the
Colorado River. He and Mrs. Steg
ner are West Coast editors of
Houghton-Mifflin.
Willi the idea to present, the dan
gers of prejudice especially against
minorities, a new book, "One Na
tion," has just been published by
Stanford Acting Professor Wallace
Stegner, who is here this quarter
etaching a course in the study of
English and American novelists.
"One Nation" deals with preju
dices in America against Negroes,
Catholics and Jews. The book is a
popularized work, written for the
layman, with the ultimate aim to
make him more tolerant. Mr. Steg
ner's book was written in co-opera
tion with the book department of
Look magazine, which provided the
picture.
