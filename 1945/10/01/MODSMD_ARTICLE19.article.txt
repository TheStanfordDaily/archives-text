### 
FREEMAN FIELD, Ind., Sept. 30
(UP).â€”The Army today unveiled a
captured German rocket-propelled
wooden interceptor plane only 20
feet long, yet built to fly 621 miles
per hour, shoot 24 rockets and float
to earth under a parachute.
Existence of the "super-secret"
plane was revealed here at an ex
hibit of captured German aircraft,
robot bombs and other equipment.
The exhibit was presented by the
Army Air Technical Service Com
mand.
The plane, with a wing span of
only 13 feet, was built to be fired
from the ground at approaching
bomber formations. It carried 7.3-
calibcr rockets in its nose.
It was designed so that the pilot
would bail out of his ship after
firing the rockets. The plane then
would descend to earth under a
large parachute.
