# Peace Plans To Be Told

### 
LONDON, Sept. 30.—(UP).—The
Council of Foreign Ministers tonight
debated the phrasing of its final com
munique, which will tell what has
been accomplished in 19 days of
confeiences on the world peace set
tlement.
A communique issued following
tonight's meeting said the statesmen
would m'cet again tomorrow even
ing. II revealed nothing of tonight's
session, at which it was understood
the ministers, their deputies and ex
pertr; began the struggle to write
in three languages a final communi
que satisfactory to five nations.
The communique was not expected
to be issued until late tomorrow, at
the tarilest. Sources close to the
conferees said the communique
probably would disclose several de
cisions by the council of which the
world had no official knowledge.
The delegations also plunged in
to what may be an even more diffi
cult task, the wording of the official
minutes of the meetings.
Soviet Russia has been most fas
tidious regarding the wording of
the minutes and official announce
ments. The official Tass news agency
"corrected" the wording of the com
munique lo which the Russian dele
gation objected.
What the communique would say
regarding the Balkan treaties was
the No. 1 question tonight. The
United States and Russia at last re
port were deadlocked on the treaty
