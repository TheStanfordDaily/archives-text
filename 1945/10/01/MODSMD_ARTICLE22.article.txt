# Fire Breaks, Fog May Stop Marin Blaze
## 
### 
WOOD ACRE. Cal., Sept.. 30 (UP).
—Approximately 2,000 weary fire
fighters, who are battling a timber
and brush blaze along a 15-mile
front, tonight hoped that fire breaks
and a prediction of fog may bring
under control a serious Marin
County fire.
It was tentatively estimated to
night by County Fire Chief Lloyd
de la Montana that 21,000 acres of
second growth had been destroyed.
This community is at one edge of
the fire, the other being 15 miles
to the northwest near Mt. Tamal
pais. Fire Chief Montana said that
of the 2,000 fighters, 500 are ac
tively engaged, while 1,500 are held
in reserve.
The Navy's plan to use eight
Avenger torpedo bombers from
Alameda to spread an acid smoke
screen over the area in attempting
to smother the flames was canceled
today. Officials said a flight by a
reconnaissance plane indicated that
smoke was 8,000 feet thick and that
danger to both planes and fire fight
ers would be too thick.
The sheriff's office in Marin Coun
ty reported that four small com
munities—Lagunita, Forest Knolls,
Woodacre and Geronimo—were no
longer seriously endangered. Ap
proximately 15 families were evac
uated from Lagunitas, seven miles
west of here, last night.
Evacuating vehicles still were br
ing kept in readiness, the sheriff's
office reported, in case conditions
suddenly change.
A backfire was started today
near Mt. Tamalpais Ridge road and
the sheriff's office indicated the
blaze in that vicinity was under
"partial control." Soldiers from
Hamilton Field and inmates of San
Quentin are among the fire fighters.
Despite the elarge number of men
fighting the fire, no casualties have
yet been reported, officials said.
