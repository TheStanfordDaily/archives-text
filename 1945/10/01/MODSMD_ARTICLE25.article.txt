# THE 						QUAD NEEDS YOU!
## 
### 
The years at Stanford go by, and just as serenely as we are
here we will have gone. For most of us there are only four years
tc. remember; for some, even less.
Across Lomita Drive, in the newly painted Quad offices,
■there is a staff of students interested in recording for you, in
pictures and in print, a resume of the events, the familiar places,
the people you knew—the things which you will remember
from year to year as essentially Stanford.
Putting together a yearbook reguires intricate planning, an
uncapped variety of talents, three guarters of steady work, and
a cohesive spirit among staff members of "doing the job, and
doing it well." It involves hesitant cutting here, and last-minute
expanding there, to fit the over-all plan. It necessitates entering
it to every phase of Stanford life, getting the feel of it, and com
piling in as expressive as possible a way, how it seemed then
end will seem afterward in memory.
Mildred Edwards, editor of Quad, '46, admits that the work
which is involved as a staff member is fully as earnest as the
sense of enjoyment. But she, and other veteran members of
the staff, are already sketching the outlines of next year's book,
because the job seems to them worth while, and because many
students expect automatically to receive their Quad in June be
cause they have paid five dollars.
However, these students cannot turn out the Quad alone; the
present number of staff members is plainly insufficient for the
amount and variety of work to be done. Perhaps because last
year's Quad did not appear in June —or perhaps because work
ing on a publication with only one deadline does not call forth
much publicity for the individual—students have been discour
aged about or wary of accepting the open, standing invitation to
work on the staff.
Tomorrow the first meeting for prospective staff personnel
will take place. It may seem odd that a rival publication should
sing the praises of Stanford's yearbook; at the same time it is
understandable that we, like other students, are interested in
having a Quad that will back up our praise of the Farm, that will
explain and recall the conglomeration of fun-times and lazy hours,
and evenings "sweating it out" in the Libe. We want a yearbook
of which we'll be proud.
Again we say, they cannot do it alone. The Quad staff is ask
ing your help and your ability, and they need it beginning to
morrow night.—B. M. V.
