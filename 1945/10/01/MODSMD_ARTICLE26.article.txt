# WHERE ARE THE POLITICIANS?

For a while there, news of national political conventions was
obscured at Stanford by the uproar of Young Democrat meet
ings, the replies, immediate and fervent, from organized student
Republicans, and enthusiastic speculation as to who would be
victorious in Stanford's version of 1944's political race between
Roosevelt and Dewey. National campaigning was not ignored
but it was definitely secondary.
For on the campus interested students had called an all
campus political debate in addition to regular meetings, and
living groups had invited informed faculty members to discuss
the election's primary issues. Student consciences worried
about campaign utterances on foreign- policy; much intelligent
questioning was overheard concerning Dewey's promises for a
bigger and better New Deal.
November 5 marked the end of the election, and the virtual
end of organization for Young Democrats and Stanford Republi
cans. Bets were paid off and words were eaten, and Stanford's
interest in politics took a dive toward nonentity.
But today Congress is still having its troubles. Democrats
and Republicans are still facing each other across the line on
certain guestions of action or approach. There still remain issues
which do not reguire factionalism but demand informed political
opinion. University students can no more avoid publicity as
future leaders of their nation than they can afford complete ig
norance of current developments in Washington—whether tc
. void a stoppage in table conversation or better to comprehend
and utilize the knowledge which they are gathering in hopes of
being belter citizens.
Realizing this, it occurred to us to inguire what had happened
to Stanford's Young Democrats and Republicans, and if there
h -d been any thought of resuming the meetings of either organi
zation.
