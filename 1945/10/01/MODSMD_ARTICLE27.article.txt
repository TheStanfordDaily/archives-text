# 'GI Joe' Is Memorial To Pyle's Infrantrymen
## Oozing Mini Provides Genuine War Realism; Charlie Chan Shows Latest Sewer Fashions 
### 
The "Story of GI Joe," now at
the Stanford, is Ernie Pyle's war,
and the infantry's war. It is as much

a memorial to the
soldiers Ernie
Pyle spoke of as
"living miserably
and dying miser
ably," as were the
the columns he
turned out.
Too many war
movies have been
made just to sep
arate the news-

reels from the main feature, but the
"Story of GI Joe" is a real story.
It's a rare war picture that could
hold up after V-J day, but Ernie
Pyle's story has lost none of its
punch. It is perhaps even more
powerful now as the remainder of a
struggle and an obligation.
Oozingly Realistic
The "Story" is realistic even down
to mud so oozy you get outside sur
prised it isn't raining. Warneke and
his phonograph record, Red who
falls asleep in any position, and the
Captain who worries about sending
new men on patrol under the guns
of Cassino, are me'n to remember.
There is nothing in the "Story of
GI Joe" that looks like the adver
tising posters for V-Mail. Besides
the mud and the perpetual stubble,
they've at last admitted the photo
graphically that people to have
reckles.
Wedding March Parody
Particularly good is the wedding
scene, where the bride can hardly
be distinguished from the men. and
the infantry sing a parody of the
wedding march. Excellent too, is
the repartee between Ernie Pyle

and fellow correspondents as he pre
pared to write another column; the
quiet when the donkeys are brought
in with vhe dead.
As a matter of fact, the whole
show is just plain good. It's one
movie that's worth walking down to
Palv to Bee.
Coke Bottle Chan
The inevitable contrast is "Charlie
Qhan and the Shanghai Cobra,"
Charlie seems to be the one man in
Hollywood that a coke bottle figure
can't hold back.
The Shanghai Cobra becomes pro
gressively more confused. Although
Chan seems to have solved it to his
own satisfaction, it still seems like
push button tuning.
Four Down
Four men are killed by a corbra
poison no one knows how, why, or
where. All are associated with the
Sixth National Bank, where United
States radium is stored. With this
setting, Sidney Toler has two strikes
against him before he even stepped
in front of the camera.
His "Number one son," and
chauffer do much crawling, stumbl
ing, falling, and pointing. Chan
emerges from sewers, manholes and
bank vaults with -the same white
Panama suit, sending every man out
of the theater trying to find his
tailor.
Poor Plastic
Jan Van Horn, mystery man
throughout the show, doesn't turn
out to resemble in build, personality
o rsize, the plastic surgical results.
Explosions, laboratories and poisons
seem to show some atomic bomb
influence. It's too bad it weren't
dropped with it Ayres

and fellow correspondents as he pre
pared to write another column; the
quiet when the donkeys are brought
in with vhe dead.
As a matter of fact, the whole
show is just plain good. It's one
movie that's worth walking down to
Palv to Bee.
Coke Bottle Chan
The inevitable contrast is "Charlie
Qhan and the Shanghai Cobra,"
Charlie seems to be the one man in
Hollywood that a coke bottle figure
can't hold back.
The Shanghai Cobra becomes pro
gressively more confused. Although
Chan seems to have solved it to his
own satisfaction, it still seems like
push button tuning.
Four Down
Four men are killed by a corbra
poison no one knows how, why, or
where. All are associated with the
Sixth National Bank, where United
States radium is stored. With this
setting, Sidney Toler has two strikes
against him before he even stepped
in front of the camera.
His "Number one son," and
chauffer do much crawling, stumbl
ing, falling, and pointing. Chan
emerges from sewers, manholes and
bank vaults with -the same white
Panama suit, sending every man out
of the theater trying to find his
tailor.
Poor Plastic
Jan Van Horn, mystery man
throughout the show, doesn't turn
out to resemble in build, personality
o rsize, the plastic surgical results.
Explosions, laboratories and poisons
seem to show some atomic bomb
influence. It's too bad it weren't
dropped with it Ayres

The "Story of GI Joe," now at
the Stanford, is Ernie Pyle's war,
and the infantry's war. It is as much

a memorial to the
soldiers Ernie
Pyle spoke of as
"living miserably
and dying miser
ably," as were the
the columns he
turned out.
Too many war
movies have been
made just to sep
arate the news-

reels from the main feature, but the
"Story of GI Joe" is a real story.
It's a rare war picture that could
hold up after V-J day, but Ernie
Pyle's story has lost none of its
punch. It is perhaps even more
powerful now as the remainder of a
struggle and an obligation.
Oozingly Realistic
The "Story" is realistic even down
to mud so oozy you get outside sur
prised it isn't raining. Warneke and
his phonograph record, Red who
falls asleep in any position, and the
Captain who worries about sending
new men on patrol under the guns
of Cassino, are me'n to remember.
There is nothing in the "Story of
GI Joe" that looks like the adver
tising posters for V-Mail. Besides
the mud and the perpetual stubble,
they've at last admitted the photo
graphically that people to have
reckles.
Wedding March Parody
Particularly good is the wedding
scene, where the bride can hardly
be distinguished from the men. and
the infantry sing a parody of the
wedding march. Excellent too, is
the repartee between Ernie Pyle

and fellow correspondents as he pre
pared to write another column; the
quiet when the donkeys are brought
in with vhe dead.
