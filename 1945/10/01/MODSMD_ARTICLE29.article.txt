### Cathryn Owen 
Since you've been back, have y' noticed—
—the rov/s of saddle shoes outside the modern dance studio?
Darned inconvenient, this business of going back to buying
shoestrings and wearing socks.
—traffic on the road lhat runs past Toyon and Encina? It's
not exactly the shortest route from Quad classes to Roble, but
you avoid all that nasty traffic—and anyway, we wanta see
where the 1.04 part of the ratio is keeping itself.
—five big Dailies a week? That means more and more inches
from Roos Brothers and bigger and bigger pictures of Kennedy.
! —the tents pitched in the fields around Branner Heights?
Their lights are hooked up with the San Jose Power Company,
and they have access to the bus that runs from Branner to the
campus every half-hour. It's a lot more comfortable than the
guarters that some room-desperates have set up in P.O. boxes.
—the little man with the flit gun, who's been wandering
around campus, defleaing mattresses? The fleas can't stand the
smell, but neither can you. So there you both sit out in the hall
for next week, waiting for the room to air out, so that you can
move back in together.
■—how no one ever mentions the Chintzy Room of the Wom
en's Clubhouse any more? Probably the influence of the more
masculine post-war Stanford we've been hearing about. Rumor
has it that the coffee tables are being converted into miniature
billiard tables and that the chintz is giving way to dark cowhide,
with matching padding on the ceiling. Then there are the springs
they're installing under the floor boards, a la Branner, so that
the decks can be cleared after the "Y" meetings, for a hot little
round of basketball.
—rumors about Seguoia? One story has it that every night
al midnight, the ghost of the old-time Rough—the one who took
a horse up into his room on the top floor of Seguoia and then had
to take a wall cut to get the horse down weeps through a whole
box of Kleenex. Poor guy has guite a case of sinus.

and they have access to the bus that runs from Branner to the
campus every half-hour. It's a lot more comfortable than the
guarters that some room-desperates have set up in P.O. boxes.
—the little man with the flit gun, who's been wandering
around campus, defleaing mattresses? The fleas can't stand the
smell, but neither can you. So there you both sit out in the hall
for next week, waiting for the room to air out, so that you can
move back in together.
■—how no one ever mentions the Chintzy Room of the Wom
en's Clubhouse any more? Probably the influence of the more
masculine post-war Stanford we've been hearing about. Rumor
has it that the coffee tables are being converted into miniature
billiard tables and that the chintz is giving way to dark cowhide,
with matching padding on the ceiling. Then there are the springs
they're installing under the floor boards, a la Branner, so that
the decks can be cleared after the "Y" meetings, for a hot little
round of basketball.
—rumors about Seguoia? One story has it that every night
al midnight, the ghost of the old-time Rough—the one who took
a horse up into his room on the top floor of Seguoia and then had
to take a wall cut to get the horse down weeps through a whole
box of Kleenex. Poor guy has guite a case of sinus.
