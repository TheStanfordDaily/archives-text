# Mosher Urges Strike Conference
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 30 (UP).â€”lra
Mosher, president of the National
Association of Manufacturers, said
today that he would urge that the
national labor-management confer
ence be convened immediately so
that a remedy could be worked out
before the nation's economy "is col
lapsing because of strikes."
Mosher said he would go to Wash
ington Thursday to ask the secre
taries of Labor and Commerce to
schedule the meeting at the earliest
possible date instead of as originally
planned on Nov. 5.
He said that it was possible "that
the present conflict between man
agement and labor will bring eco
nomic collapse and chaos."
"We cannot, therefore, wait to
start to deal with the remedy until
our whole economy is collapsing
because of strikes," he said. "I be
lieve that the public interest will be
endangered if we delay this meet
ing."
Mosher, who is a member of the
committee named by President
Truman to work out arrangements
for the meeting, said it was wishful
thinking to expect the conference
to stop present strikes, but "it can
lay the long range basis for cor
rection of the causes."
