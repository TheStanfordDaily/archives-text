## 
### 
A national campaign to help re
stock the devastated libraries of Rus
sia has been organized recently, with
the Stanford Bookstore as one of the
depots for collecting books in this
area, the publicity director of the
Palo Alto campaign announced yes
terday.
Named as chairman of the "Books
for Russia" campaign for the north
ern California area is President Don
ald B. Tresidder of Stanford.
Six Stanford faculty members are
among the sponsors of the local
drive. Dr. Roger Barker, Dr. Harold
H. Fisher, Dr. Henry Lanz, Dr. Al
bert Guerard, Dr. James Mcßain,
and Dr. Frank Weymouth.
Libraries Were Targets
"Libraries in the conquered areas
of the Soviet Union were a favorite
target of Nazi barbarity," said Dr.
Harry B. Reynolds, retired Palo Alto
physician and chairman of the Palo
Alto "Books for Russia" committee.
"It has been calculated that at least
23 million volumes were stolen or
destroyed by the Germans in the
Russian Soviet Socialist Republic
alone, many of the books in Eng
lish which only the generosity of
the American people can immediate
ly replace. Since, moreover, the
teaching of English is expanding
rapidly in the Soviet Union—it has
become a compulsory language in
the secondary schools of the large
cities—the books for which our com
mittee appeals at this time are all
the more desperately needed," Dr.
Reynolds stated.
Books desired by the committee
should be primarily of permanent
value, generally described as "Clas
sics," but scientific works and
technical books published since 1926
are also requested. The commit
tee asks that donors choose books
which they think the Russians
would like to read and which best
reflect and portray the American
and British way of life.
Books Will llclp Build Peace
In a statement from Moscow, Dr.
Sproul said, "Books for Russia
project can do much to cultivate
understanding and develop friend
ship among the peoples of the Unit
ed States and the Soviet Union.
Helping to restore Russia's empty
library shelves with American and
English literature will build lasting
cultural ties and contribute thereby
to mankind's hopes for peace."
[ Unsuitable for the committee's
purposes are cheap novels, diction
aries, paper-bound volumes, text
books, translations, or books whose
content is purely propagandistic.
The "Books for Russia" campaign
will be carried on in schools, li
braries, clubs, and churches of Palo
Alto. Aside from the depot at the
Stantord Bookstore, are depots at
the South Palo Alto Branch Library,

the Palo Alto Community Center,
an dthe headquarters of Russian
Relief at 540 Emerson Street. Ar
rangements for the picking up of
large donations of books can be
made by calling Russian Relief
Headquarters, P.A. 2-5110.

Libraries Were Targets
"Libraries in the conquered areas
of the Soviet Union were a favorite
target of Nazi barbarity," said Dr.
Harry B. Reynolds, retired Palo Alto
physician and chairman of the Palo
Alto "Books for Russia" committee.
"It has been calculated that at least
23 million volumes were stolen or
destroyed by the Germans in the
Russian Soviet Socialist Republic
alone, many of the books in Eng
lish which only the generosity of
the American people can immediate
ly replace. Since, moreover, the
teaching of English is expanding
rapidly in the Soviet Union—it has
become a compulsory language in
the secondary schools of the large
cities—the books for which our com
mittee appeals at this time are all
the more desperately needed," Dr.
Reynolds stated.
Books desired by the committee
should be primarily of permanent
value, generally described as "Clas
sics," but scientific works and
technical books published since 1926
are also requested. The commit
tee asks that donors choose books
which they think the Russians
would like to read and which best
reflect and portray the American
and British way of life.
Books Will llclp Build Peace
In a statement from Moscow, Dr.
Sproul said, "Books for Russia
project can do much to cultivate
understanding and develop friend
ship among the peoples of the Unit
ed States and the Soviet Union.
Helping to restore Russia's empty
library shelves with American and
English literature will build lasting
cultural ties and contribute thereby
to mankind's hopes for peace."
[ Unsuitable for the committee's
purposes are cheap novels, diction
aries, paper-bound volumes, text
books, translations, or books whose
content is purely propagandistic.
The "Books for Russia" campaign
will be carried on in schools, li
braries, clubs, and churches of Palo
Alto. Aside from the depot at the
Stantord Bookstore, are depots at
the South Palo Alto Branch Library,

the Palo Alto Community Center,
an dthe headquarters of Russian
Relief at 540 Emerson Street. Ar
rangements for the picking up of
large donations of books can be
made by calling Russian Relief
Headquarters, P.A. 2-5110.
