ST. LOUIS. Sept. 30 (UP).â€”Hank
1 Greenberg, a hero in war and in
peace, enabled thee Detroit Tigers
j to win their first American League
pennant since 1940 today when he
: dramatically smashed a ninth-in
j ning homer with the bases loaded
to'beat the St. Louis Browns, 6 to 3.
Hal Nevvhouser, who went into
the game to relieve Virgil (Fire)
i Trucks in the sixth, gained his
I 25th victory of the season, against
nine defeats. A steady drizzle
poured down on the 6,fi13 fans
throughout the game. After the
deciding victory the second game
was called off.
The Tigers thus will meet the
Chicago Cubs, winners of the Na
tional League flag, in the World
Series opening in Detroit Wednes
day.
Trucks, released from the
j Navy a week ago and playing in his
! first major league game since 1943,
had held the Browns to two hits
until the sixth and had a one-rifn
lead. Nelson Potter, who went the
route for the Brownies, slammed out
a double with one out. That appar
ently unnerved Trucks and he
walked Don Gutteridge. Newhouser
came in, walked Lou Finney, struck
out Mark Christman, batting for
Milt Byrnes, and made George Mc-
Quinn fly out.

The Browns picked up one run in
the first inning, on a double by Gut
teridge and a single by Finney.
Trucks, until forced to the showers,
bore down on every pitch.
Potter gave up nine hits in los
ing his 11th game, against 15 vic
tories. The Tigers needed but a
single victory to clinch the league
Hag. A double win by the Browns
would have forced a playoff game
with the Washington Senators in
Detroit tomorrow.
The Browns scored again in the
seventh on a double by Gene Moore
and a single by Vern Stephens and
went ahead a run in the eighth.
Alter Gutteridge had struck out,
Finney singled and was forced by
Pete Gray, who went into center
field when Byrnes was taken out.
McQuinn slapped out a double and
Gray scored with a face-first slide
into the plate.
Potter's downfall came in the
ninth. Hubby Walker batted for
Newhouser and singled. Skeeter
Webb was safe on a fielder's
choice when Walker was called
safe at second on a play hotly
protested by the Browns. Eddie
Mayo was out, McQuinn to Gut
teridge, who covered first. Potter
walked Roger (Doc) Cramer in
tentionally. loading the bases. Big
Hank Greenberg stepped to the
plate and slammed out a home
run high in the left-fieled bleach
ers.
