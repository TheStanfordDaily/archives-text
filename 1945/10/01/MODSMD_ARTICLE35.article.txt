# Trojans Down Golden Bears Saturday; 13-2
## 
### Sports Staff 
Before a throng of 55,000 in the
Memorial Stadium last Saturday,
Jeff Cravath's Trojans of Southern
California tripped the Golden Bears
to the tune of 13-2. If U.S.C. has
hopes of getting the Rose Bowl nod
for the third straight year, they
certainly will have to improve their
play. Only in spurts did they click
like a championship aggregation,
and only due to the complete infe
riority of the Bei'keley boys were
they able to cop the game.
The Trojans' first touchdown
came in the first quarter, after their
substitute fullback, Doug Gee, in
tercepeted a Cal pass. Starting from
the opponents' 41-yard linee S.C.
made a series of runs, and one pass
by Lillywhite, which brought the
ball to the 6-yard striper. Bobby
Morris, more notably known for
javelin-heaving feats, then went
through the right side of the line
on a twister for six points. Walt
McCormick, who moved to the
backfield from his regular center
position, converted for the extra
point, making the score 7-0.
U.S.C. Stoics
In the second quarter the sup
posedly invincible Los Angeles club
penetrated deep into Cal territory
on several occasions, but lacked
that extra zip necessary for a touch
down the initial part of the period.
Cal got control of the ball on their
own 25, after thee Trojans lost it
on downs, but Bob Gray fumbled
the ball, S.C. recovering it to give
them another chance for some
points. This time they didn't fail.
Lillywhite lopped a pass to Bobby
Morris for a touchdown. McCor
mick's attempted placemen* was
blocked by Howard Peterson of the
California forward wall, making the
score 13-0.
Worst Trojan play came in the
third period, and the only reason
Cal failed to score was their lack
of a capable ball-heaver. Twice the
Bears got control of the ball deep
in enemy territory as a result of
fumbles, but Cal in turn lost the
ball both times. Once as a result

of their own fumble, and another
on an intercepted pass caught by
Jerry Bowman.
Two Points for Cal
Persistent Cal, although they
couldn't grab six points, did man
age to get a touchback when Jim
Peterson was dumped by a couple
of Cal linemen in the end, thus
boosting the ante up to 13-2.
Late in the fourth quarter Cal
came to life again when George Mc-
Donald started throwing the ball
for successful yardage, but one pass
too many was thrown, and Bobby
Morris intercepted it to end the
threat from the Buck Shaw boys.
The Trojan backfield clicked
when Lillywhite played, but his
leg was injured in the first half,
so Jerry Bowman played mostly
in the quarterback slot. Bowman,
a discharged Air Corps captain,
was a letterman of a few ycaers
back, but his late return to the
squad this year didn't permit him
to be very familiar with all the
plays, and several times their
plays misfired. Bobby Morris, who
played most of the afternoon in
the Cravath backfield, was un
doubtedly the best man on the
S.C. squad in the egame.
Johnny Pehar, a 6-foot-7 giant
weighing 285 pounds, was the work
horse of the line, although Jim Cal
lanan, the team captain, also played
an excellent game at end.
For Cal the outstanding player
was Bob Lossi, captain and center
of the squad. He was the whole
line. All the team needs is a good
passer. Pass receivers they have
galore. Billy Agnew, triple-threat
backfield man on the Stanford from
of 1940, enrolled at Cal over the
week-end. Maybe he'll be just the
man they need.
