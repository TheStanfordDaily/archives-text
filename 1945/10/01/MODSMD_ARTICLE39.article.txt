# Registrar Winbigler Lives in A World Filled With Irate Mothers, Unadmitted Daughters
## 
### BOB PECK 
"In spite of the fact that my poor
Margie flunked her way through
high school, don't you think there's
some little thing you could do about
getting her into Stanford?" an irate
mothei asks H. Donald Winbigler,
new Farm registrar. And Mr. Win
bigler winces.
"In the first place," as Mr. Win
bigler explained it to me. "the se
lection of all students is left to an
Admission Committee of which I am
just a member. We have our mini
mum entrance requirements* at
Stanford and usually there are so
many applications we have to work
on a competitive basis among the
applicants with suitable recommend
ations."
Admission Committee
Before a student is accepted at
Stanford two rrtembers of the six
man Admission committee read the
qualifications of the student and the
personal recommendations. Then the
board, consisting this year of Dean
John Stalnaker, Dean Mary Yost,
Professor George Sensabaugh. Pro
fessor Paul Holden, Professor Rich
ard LaPiere, and Mr. Winbigler.
votes on the students applying for
admission. Occasionally special
cases come up and the committee
has to consider certain objective
factoii, and certain subjective fac
tors, Mr. Winbigler went on to say.
Golden Days of the 500
Back in the days of the 500. there
was a definite attempt to keep the
ratio of women under that of the

registration of men. But now the
factor governing the registration
figures on campus is regulated by
housing facilities, according to Mr.
Winbigler. It is obvious that the
Farm has found itself in a position
of having more dormitories for men
J than for women.
On the question of veterans and
; their entrance requirements, Mr.
! Winbigler says that every attempt
is made to "treat the veterans under
| the same standard as non-veterans.
| so far as entrance requirements are
| concerned."
"In instances where the veteran
I has had a poor record before enter
j ing the service, if he can bring
definite strength to offset his prev
j ious record, the committee considers
i these new factors," the registrar
| said.

Mr. Winbigler is only the third
man to occupy the registrar's seat
since the founding of the Farm. O.
L. Elliott was registrar's from 1891
to 1920 and recently retired J. P.
Mitchell was registrar for the past
25 years.
Oddly enough Mr. Winbigler re
ceived his Doctor's degree in the
field of speech and drama. A Mon
mouth College (Illinois) graduate,
| the young registrar received his
Master's and Doctor's at the Uni-
I versity of lowa.
Coming to Stanford in 1940. Mr.
! Winbigler taught in the schools of
speech and drama and education.
Since 1942 and before his appoint
ment as registrar he had been doing

work in the registrar's office under
the official title of Assistant Regis
trar.
Although "not a farmer at heart,"
Mr. Winbigler finds himself with a
ten-acre fruit and chicken ranch in
Los Altos. His hobbies range from
reading to the apricots but his work
has occupied the major portion of
his time lately.

Mr. Winbigler is only the third
man to occupy the registrar's seat
since the founding of the Farm. O.
L. Elliott was registrar's from 1891
to 1920 and recently retired J. P.
Mitchell was registrar for the past
25 years.
Oddly enough Mr. Winbigler re
ceived his Doctor's degree in the
field of speech and drama. A Mon

Master's and Doctor's at the Uni-
I versity of lowa.
Coming to Stanford in 1940. Mr.
! Winbigler taught in the schools of
speech and drama and education.
Since 1942 and before his appoint
ment as registrar he had been doing

work in the registrar's office under
the official title of Assistant Regis
trar.
Although "not a farmer at heart,"
Mr. Winbigler finds himself with a
ten-acre fruit and chicken ranch in
Los Altos. His hobbies range from
reading to the apricots but his work
has occupied the major portion of
his time lately.
"In spite of the fact that my poor
Margie flunked her way through
high school, don't you think there's
some little thing you could do about
getting her into Stanford?" an irate
mothei asks H. Donald Winbigler,
new Farm registrar. And Mr. Win
bigler winces.
"In the first place," as Mr. Win
bigler explained it to me. "the se
lection of all students is left to an
Admission Committee of which I am
just a member. We have our mini
mum entrance requirements* at
Stanford and usually there are so
many applications we have to work
on a competitive basis among the
applicants with suitable recommend
ations."
Admission Committee
Before a student is accepted at
Stanford two rrtembers of the six

qualifications of the student and the
personal recommendations. Then the
board, consisting this year of Dean
John Stalnaker, Dean Mary Yost,
Professor George Sensabaugh. Pro

admission. Occasionally special
cases come up and the committee
has to consider certain objective
factoii, and certain subjective fac
tors, Mr. Winbigler went on to say.
Golden Days of the 500
Back in the days of the 500. there
was a definite attempt to keep the
ratio of women under that of the

registration of men. But now the
factor governing the registration
figures on campus is regulated by
housing facilities, according to Mr.
Winbigler. It is obvious that the
Farm has found itself in a position
of having more dormitories for men
J than for women.
