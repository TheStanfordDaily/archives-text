### Crystal Bowl Gazer 
The Daily board of grid experts
did it again. Never ones to say die
in a crisis, the boys deliberated and
meditated many hours before they
announced their football choices for
last Saturday's grid titanics.
Experts in all wakes of life were
consulted before the boys delivered
their weighty dissertations. A lead
ing astronomical observer was con
sulted regarding solar activities in
relationship to forward passes and
punts. A leading weather observa
tionist was consulted in regard to
the weather. A leading palmist wa:-
consulted, mainly because she was
cute. A leading psychologist was
consulted in regard to hidden
motives, secret love affairs of the
football players, and hidden desires
of the coaches. And the truly be
loved character of the Horse and
Handbook set, Three-to-five Jones
was consulted. Jones had a lot of
choicy advice to give.
After collecting reems of advice
from the leading experts, the grid
boys added their own observations
and anecdotes, collected after many
years of professional sports observ
ing.
The results speak for themselves.
Jim Welter and Art Levinson lead
the parade with a 94% average. Jim
slipped up on the "U of W" game,
and Art missed the boat of the
U.C J..A.-Naval Training Station
team of "Diego."
Trailing very closely, collecting
place and show money, were Rob
ert Slobe and A 1 Sciaroni. Both
lads had an 88% average. Slobe
tripped on the Washington and
U.C.L.A. games, ana Sciaroni struck
out on the Purdue and Fleet City
games.
For professional advice with any
