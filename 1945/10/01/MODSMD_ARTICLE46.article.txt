VERNON, Sept. 30 (UP).—Fire
men from the Los Angeles County
and Vernon fire departments today
began to extinguish a blaze in a

for the county, made a quick phone
call to the county fire dispatcher
and learned that the blaze was in
an unincorporated territory whose
residents have never voted to pay
for fire protection.
The firemen promptly picked up
their apparatus and left — leaving
the building still burning.
