CHUNGKING, Sept. 30 (UP).—
The agreement of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's central govern
ment and Chinese Communists to
convene an all - party political
council early in October gave prom
ise today of paving the way for set
tlement of the bitter internal con
flict which has torn China for the
past decade.
Lifting of Chinese censorship per
mits the disclosure that four weeks
of conference between the Kuo
mingtang and the Communists had
bogged down and reached a virtual
stalemate when the agreement was
reached to summon the political
council representing the divergent
elements of China.
Under present plans, the political
council will have power to make
binding decisions and is scheduled
to discuss two broad subjects:
1. A policy of peaceful recon
struction for China.
2. The establishment of a na
tional assembly which will attempt
to frame a new Chinese constitu
tion.
On the success of the political
council hinges the peace of hun
dreds of millions of Asiatics.
Indications are the council will be
composed of 37 members. The Kuo
mintang and Communists will be
represented by nine men each.
Other parties, including the Demo
cratic League, are slated to seat
nine representatives. Nine delegates
will represent Chinese political ele
ments without definite party align
ments and Chiang will sit as chair
man.
The first meeting of the council,
agreed upon by the central govern
ment and Communist negotiators on
Sept. 28, is expected to convene on
Oct. 10. It will wrestle with such
thorny problems as the future sta
tus of Communist armies, the fate
of guerilla governments which grew
up behind Japanese lines during the
war and the general democratization
of the Chinese government struc
ture.
