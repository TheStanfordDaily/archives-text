# Nation Reverts To Standard Time
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Sept. 30 (UP).â€”
The nation was adjusting itself to
night to a change in time which may
be a little hard for the boys who
have been getting in some golf after
work.
Clocks were turned back one hour
to standard time at 2 a.m. today,
ending the stcpped-up war time that
was adopted Feb. 9, 1942, as a pow
er-saving measure. The lone ex
ception is Chicago, where a city or
dinance will keep war time in be
ing until Oct. 28.
Effect of the change is that dawn
and dark both now come an hour
earlier. Farmers are the chief bene
ficiaries. They had been grousing
ever since the clocks were turned
up because their chickens and cows
were unimpressed by presidential
orders and continued to get. up at
daybreak no matter what the hour
hand said.
For city dwellers, however, the
change wasn't so welcome. They
had grown to like that extra hour
of daylight at the end of the day.
Now. golf, tennis and other outdoor
activities are postponed until next
spring on account of darkness.
The switch was a problem in
chronology for railroads and buses.
Many lines stopped trains for one
hour to allow clocks to catch up
with their schedules. Others or
dered slowdowns to make the ad
justments.
Airlines operated planes on war
time whenever the trip originated
before 2 a.m.
