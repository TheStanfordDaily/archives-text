A brief flash of light reached out
from the mezannine of the Admin
istration Building and recorded on
i film t picture of autumn quarter
j Reg Day—the first picture for the
j 1946 edition of the Stanford Quad.
"The Quad will be out on time
this year if we have to give you
bound page proofs," is the promise
of the Quad's new editor, Mildred
Edwards, to the campus. "But if you
want u Quad that fulfills the promise
which a photography studio, a new
photographer, a greater number of
pages and increased facilities has
given us—we must have a working
I staff."
Editor Calls for Workers
Tuesday evening at 7:30 Miss Ed
j wards will issue a call for students
j to work as photographers, writers,
artists and office helpers. The staff
as it exists is not lacking in en
! thusiasm, but in membership; in
i order to encourage more students
to give their time to the year-long
production of the Quad, the offices

have been painted, set in careful
order, and a radio and card table
installed to make working condi
tions more pleasant.
A system of rotation will be
initiated in the work for tryoutees.
They may experiment in various
fields of the editorial work before
deciding at what position or on what
section they would like best to work.
A paying position is open for a
student who qualifies as the official
campus photographer.
To Have Four Sections
The year book has been divided j
into four sections—Classes, Activi
ties, Sports (and this will be an im
portant one) and Life, and Living j
groups. Student workers may work
on whichever section they would j
most enjoy.
Individual photographs for the
Living Group section will be taken :
by a veteran—a veteran from the
military point of view in that he was
discharged from the army nine days
ago, end a veteran in photography
as a result of extensive study and

31 months of service, in Alaska as a
signal corps lens-man.
His name is John Lawrence. Al
though he will be setting up a stu
dio in Palo Alto, he will devote all
his afternoons to work on the 46
Quad —work which can be done in
the Quad's studio and darkroom.
Students will this year not be asked
to nu.ke the long and often incon
venient trip to Palo Alto for sittings.
Quad To Be Pictorial
Prospective editorial writers for
the Quad are informed by Miss Ed
wards that the style of writing will
be similar to that of Life or Time
magazines—concise, colorful, direct
—to add interest to the pages and to
leave room for the photos which
will make up most of the "largely
pictoiial" Quad.
Army, Navy Needed
"Candids will be used in abund
ance," Miss Edwards stated. "Any
snapshots of students in action are
in great demand—if you don't have
any you can turn in now, get out
your cameras and work up a collec
tion."

Navy and army students arc par
ticularly urged to turn out at the
initial staff meeting Tuesday night,
so that they may insure a repre
sentative view in the Quad of the
military, academic and social side of
their life at Stanford.
Students to represent each class
are wanted also, to take charge of
the section to be called Classes.
Business Positions
Business Manager Ann Lilienthal
will hold tryouts at the same time,
and urges all students interested
in selling ads or in selling year
books to the student body to attend
Tuesday's meeting.
Miss Edwards previewed this
year's Quad by saying it will be
larger than last year's, it will in
clude a large athletic section, and
as much color as possible will be
employed.
Managing editor of the yearbook
is Virginia Walker. Jean Crowell
has consented to sketch the division
pages, but will need other artists
to ccmplete the extensive art work
in th« • book.

Editor Calls for Workers
Tuesday evening at 7:30 Miss Ed
j wards will issue a call for students
j to work as photographers, writers,
artists and office helpers. The staff
as it exists is not lacking in en
! thusiasm, but in membership; in
i order to encourage more students
to give their time to the year-long
production of the Quad, the offices

have been painted, set in careful
order, and a radio and card table
installed to make working condi
tions more pleasant.
A system of rotation will be
initiated in the work for tryoutees.
They may experiment in various
fields of the editorial work before
deciding at what position or on what
section they would like best to work.
A paying position is open for a
student who qualifies as the official
campus photographer.
To Have Four Sections
The year book has been divided j
into four sections—Classes, Activi
ties, Sports (and this will be an im
portant one) and Life, and Living j
groups. Student workers may work
on whichever section they would j
most enjoy.
Individual photographs for the
Living Group section will be taken :
by a veteran—a veteran from the
military point of view in that he was
discharged from the army nine days
ago, end a veteran in photography
as a result of extensive study and

31 months of service, in Alaska as a
signal corps lens-man.
His name is John Lawrence. Al
though he will be setting up a stu
dio in Palo Alto, he will devote all
his afternoons to work on the 46
Quad —work which can be done in
the Quad's studio and darkroom.
Students will this year not be asked
to nu.ke the long and often incon
venient trip to Palo Alto for sittings.
Quad To Be Pictorial
Prospective editorial writers for
the Quad are informed by Miss Ed
wards that the style of writing will
be similar to that of Life or Time
magazines—concise, colorful, direct
—to add interest to the pages and to
leave room for the photos which
will make up most of the "largely
pictoiial" Quad.
Army, Navy Needed
"Candids will be used in abund
ance," Miss Edwards stated. "Any
snapshots of students in action are
in great demand—if you don't have
any you can turn in now, get out
your cameras and work up a collec
tion."

Navy and army students arc par
ticularly urged to turn out at the
initial staff meeting Tuesday night,
so that they may insure a repre
sentative view in the Quad of the
military, academic and social side of
their life at Stanford.
Students to represent each class
are wanted also, to take charge of
the section to be called Classes.
Business Positions
Business Manager Ann Lilienthal
will hold tryouts at the same time,

in selling ads or in selling year

Miss Edwards previewed this
