# Electricians Open Drive to Organize

### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (UP).—
The ClO's United Electrical Work
ers tonight opened a drive to or
ganize employees of the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company.
It would take in workers on lines
of communication and in the com
pany's manufacturing plants.
Disclosure of the campaign was
made by Neil Brant, UEW interna
tional representative and a member
of the War Labor Board. He
charged that the A. T. & T. was be
hind an alleged strike threat made
by the National Federation of Tele
phone Workers in New York City.
A possibility that telephone com
munications may be disrupted on a
nation - wide scale arose when
NFTW President Joseph Bierne was
quoted as saying that his union
would hold continuous "meetings"
this week against the report of a
National Labor Relations Board trial
examiner. The union represents
200,000 Bell Telephone System em
ployees.
Should the employees assemble in
continuous meetings, it would have
the same effect as a strike.
The examiner recommended that
NLRB order disestablishment of the
Western Electric Employees Asso
ciation as a company union. He also
urged that WEA be required to re
turn to its members $1,250,000 in
dues collected over a seven-year
period. WEA is an independent un
ion, affiliated with the NFTW. The
CIO charged that WEA is company
dominated.
Henry Mayer, WEA counsel, said
in New York that NFTW officials
will.meet at their Baltimore head
quarters tomorrow to decide
whether meetings of "three, four or
five hours" should be held. He said
such a nation - wide "meeting"
probably would be held in the day
time and would paralyze all com
munications.
