# 'University Unprepared For Peace'-Dean Yost
## Conference Seeks To Aid New Girls 
### 
"The University is facing peace
years without much preparation for
them." Miss Mary Yost, Dean of
Women, said when addressing the

opening meeting
of Women's Con
ference yesterday
at 3 p.m. "The
values we empha
size now will de
termine what we
do later," she con
tinued.
Miss Yost said
we should take
as our motto
something Mrs.
Stanford once said

in her later yearsâ€”that we should
not bt_ afraid to outgrow old laws
and ways and start making new
ones: that we should be.looking to
the future under our care.
Frosh A "Keen Group"
One of the main problems facing
women this year is the assimilating
of new members in ;ill living groups.
For the first time in three or four
years, she said, all of the new fresh
men women are in Roble. "They
are one of the keenest groups we
have had in a long time."
However, a large group of fresh
men women entered summer quar
ter and lived at Roble. They could
not come back fall quarter and live
on campus. Many of them wanted
to come back regardless of this
difficulty; so many of them are con
tinuing to attend Stanford and are
living off campus.
Ordinarily when a student lived
o(T campus, he had to live with a
parent or guardian. The meaning
of these words has been greatly ex
tended this year so that students
are now living with friends and
people they had never met before.
Help Orient Off-Campus Students '
'"Off campus living is temporary
but acute," Miss Yost said. Cap
and Gown under the leadership of
Barbara Lamb, president, is under
taking a project to help these girls
get acquainted with Stanford stu
dents and Stanford life. This or
ganization needs the assistance of
every living group on campus to
keep these 50 or 75 girls informed
of campus activities and to enter
tain them in their houses. Girls
who are interested in helping Cap
and Gown should call Barbara Lamb
at Lagunita.
Groups To Meet New Frosh
"The living groups are one of the
chiet forces of our informal cur
riculum," Miss Yost continued.
"They are laboratories of democracy
Old residents of a living group
should try to learn the names of
the new girls swiftly."
"They should also include at least
one new girl in the central govern
ing body of the group. If you give
them something to do, no matter
how small a task, they will feel im
portant and wanted," Miss Yost
said.
When Miss Yost finished speak
ing, Conference members decided
that, spreads, open houses, and vari
ous informal social affairs within the
houses would be very effective in
assimilating new girls into the vari
ous living groups.
Fill Fall Calendar
Chairman Kolar, A.S.S.U. vice
president, said that social dates for
Fridaj nights are filling up, but that
there are still some Saturday nights
vacant. She urged all houses and
organizations to make dates for this
quarter so it will be as full a quarter
as Spring quarter generally is, and
to make the dates early.
Social regulations books were
passeo out for distribution to all
girls on campus. Refreshments were
served.
