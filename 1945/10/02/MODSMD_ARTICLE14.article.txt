## 
### 
Dean John Dodds of the English ,
Department opened the scries of in- J
formal poetry readings yesterday !
afternoon in the Briggs Room of the j
Humanities Building which mem
bers of his department have ini- :
tiated for the benefit of interested j
students.
Chairs were brought in from, ad
jacent rooms to accommodate the
; large turnout of students, but many
| seated themselves cheerfully on the
| floor. For forty-five minutes, Dean j
! Dodds read poems he had selected ;
from his favorites in the Victorian
era.
Browning and Tennyson
"The Lady of Shalot" and "Ulys- j
ses" were read from Tennyson, J
along with Robert Browning's "An- |
: drea del Sarto" and "My Last Duch- t
ess." He also read the familiar
"When 112 Was One and Twenty" in :
addition to selections from"The
Shropshire Lad" by A. E. Housman,
and Lewis Carroll's "You Are Old,
Father William."
Professors in the English depart
' ment will read favorite poems or se- I

lectcd poems from a favorite period
in English literature; they hope to
pass on to their listeners the pleas
ure they have found in these poems.
The readings arc taking place as
the fulfillment of a long-standing
wish of the departmentâ€”most of the
English professors recall undergrad
uate days when they, too, were
given the opportunity to spend af
ternoons with friends or professors
reading aloud from the works of
favorite authors.
Purely Pleasure
No lecture on poetry accompanies
the readings, nor is there any aca
demic presentation of the poems to
be read. The series is designed sole
ly for the pleasure of those who
read or listen to the reading. Stu
dents and professors may smoke.
Displays of books containing po
etry written by the authors to be
read each week will be arranged
each week, and students may in
this way acquaint themselves better
with the poets whom they particu
larly enjoy.

Dr. Yvor Winters will read from
contemporary poets next Monday
and the following Monday Dr. Mar
gery Bailey will read Elizabethan
lyrics.


DEAN JOHN W. DODDS who
read selections from poets of the
Victorian era yesterday.


MARGERY BAILEY who will read
selections from Elizabethan lyrics
for I lie* English series.
