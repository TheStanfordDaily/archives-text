The American frontier in Alaska will be the subject of the opening

Personal Story
Mr. Robinson will narrate the life
of the Robinsons as a typical Alas

cumstances. He will also show
photographic stories of other
pioneers, of the government, colony
at Matanuska, which is now nint:
years old, of crews of construction
workers brought to the northern
territory for various war projects,
and a special photographic treat

recreational activities.
"Roads North" and "Defrosting
Alaska" were Mr. Robinson's prev

Same- Series Policy
The Committee on Public Exercises
is presenting the Tuesday Series
this year with the same policy of
years pastâ€”that of varied distribu
tion of subject matter and of reflect
ing the preferences of both faculty
and students, according to John M.
Stalnaker, chairman of the commit
tee.
Since 1920 the Tuesday evening
lectures have been an indispensable
part of Stanford life. Faculty mem
bers, noted speakers from far and
near, artists, and specialists in many
fields have entertained and in
formed students, campus people,
and residents of the area since the
first days of the Series when it was
organized by David Starr Jordan,
first president of the University.
The lectures are varied usually lo
include during each month, one lec
ture on science, one on art, music
or literature; one on history or the
social sciences; and an evening on
public affairs or a motion picture.
Mr. Robinson will begin his lec
ture at 7:30 p.m. in the auditorium
of Memorial Hall.
