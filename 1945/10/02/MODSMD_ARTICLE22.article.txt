HOUSING COMMITTEE
A word in advance to all freshman women
and newcomers who will read in today's Daily
of the first Housing Committee meeting of au
tumn quarter.
Housing Committee, now a sub-committee of
Women's Conference, was created last winter
quarter to work with the Administration in find
ing a solution to a difficult campus problem—
converting former sorority houses to University
residences. The committee members were
chosen with particular care to be representa
tive and fair and their meetings quickly became
a focal point of campus interest. Several radi
cally different plans for maintaining group con
geniality without resorting to the rushing sys
tem were proposed; opinions were aired, sug
gestions were made, and step by step a plan
evolved, a plan based on the fundamental con
tention that among Stanford women "there need
be no greater criteria for selection of one's fel
low residents than their willingness to assume
the responsibilities of making the living unit
Junction."
As Housing Committee starts its autumn
quarter work the main points of the final plan
approved by the committee and the Board of
Trustees could profitably be recalled:
1. Agreement to have the same lot system of
room choosing for all women's residences.
2. Consideration of casas in Lagunita as
Small, separate units.
3. Maintenance of the co-operative living
system in former sorority houses, and inde
pendence of house policy.
4. Recommendation that the University work
toward putting kitchens and co-operative liv
ing systems into small Union units as soon as
practical and possible, if it is desired by women
in the units.
5. Recommendation that house bills be uni
form in all women's residences.
6. Establishment of an all-campus social pro
gram to acquaint freshman women with types
of living units and their members, and recom
mendation that an educational program be set
up outlining the duties, functions, advantages,
and disadvantages in all types of living groups.
Recognizing that there would be a need for
unified v/omen's action in the co-ordination of
social policy, and exchange of ideas among
various living groups, the first Housing Com
mittee recommended that a permanent cvom
mittee be set up. That committee is now ready
to cope with present-day problems in women's
housing. Its discussions will be reported in
full. Again this quarter the committee needs
the interest and co-operation of all Stanford
women to carry through its objectives: . .
the facilitation of congeniality within a resi
dence so that each woman may feel herself
part of a friendly group . . . the formulation of
a new social policy which will both unite all
women's living groups and provide a happy
way of living for each Stanford woman . . ."

converting former sorority houses to University
residences. The committee members were
chosen with particular care to be representa
tive and fair and their meetings quickly became
a focal point of campus interest. Several radi
cally different plans for maintaining group con
geniality without resorting to the rushing sys
tem were proposed; opinions were aired, sug
gestions were made, and step by step a plan
evolved, a plan based on the fundamental con
tention that among Stanford women "there need
be no greater criteria for selection of one's fel
low residents than their willingness to assume
the responsibilities of making the living unit
Junction."
As Housing Committee starts its autumn
quarter work the main points of the final plan
approved by the committee and the Board of
Trustees could profitably be recalled:
1. Agreement to have the same lot system of
room choosing for all women's residences.
2. Consideration of casas in Lagunita as
Small, separate units.
3. Maintenance of the co-operative living
system in former sorority houses, and inde
pendence of house policy.
4. Recommendation that the University work
toward putting kitchens and co-operative liv
ing systems into small Union units as soon as
practical and possible, if it is desired by women
in the units.
5. Recommendation that house bills be uni
form in all women's residences.
6. Establishment of an all-campus social pro
gram to acquaint freshman women with types
of living units and their members, and recom
mendation that an educational program be set
up outlining the duties, functions, advantages,
and disadvantages in all types of living groups.
Recognizing that there would be a need for
unified v/omen's action in the co-ordination of
social policy, and exchange of ideas among
various living groups, the first Housing Com
mittee recommended that a permanent cvom
mittee be set up. That committee is now ready
to cope with present-day problems in women's
housing. Its discussions will be reported in
full. Again this quarter the committee needs
the interest and co-operation of all Stanford
women to carry through its objectives: . .
the facilitation of congeniality within a resi
dence so that each woman may feel herself
part of a friendly group . . . the formulation of
a new social policy which will both unite all
women's living groups and provide a happy
way of living for each Stanford woman . . ."

A word in advance to all freshman women
