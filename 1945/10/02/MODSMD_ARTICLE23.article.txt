### STANLEY WILSON 
OPEN LETTER TO MR. FRANK WALKER: There
is a big question among former Row women this
quarter regarding the current expense of room and
hoard. Briefly it is this: Many of the girls are
paying considerably more for room and hoard this
year than they did under the sorority system. They
are in a quandary because there are generally more
girls in the house this quarter, fewer hashers to
fetd, and a businesslike administration running the
show instead of one of the students. All of which
should make for more economy and less house ex
pense.
Under the old system, the girls often had the ex
pense of laundry and telephone service absorbed in
the initial house bill. In most cases, this expense
now must be handled by the individuals in the house.
In brief, the former Row women would like to know
(lie reason for (he added expense and the decrease
in bouse service, and just where the extra money
is going.

My intense studv of international law in the libe last
Sunday was interrupted with a laugh when the
Carillon suddenly burst out with a few choruses of
The Three Cabelleros. I'm looking forward with ex
pectation for the time when The Groaner and the
Andrews Sisters can be procured for a quick Sun
day afternoon performance, accompanied by the
Belgium Bells.

A London paper recently came out with the state
ment that the peace was getting off to a bad start. I
was convinced of it when I read a story Sunday con
cerning American treatment of Jews in Occupied
Europe. I guess it's just a case of going from one cage
1u another, only under new management.
♦ * * * *
I have run into lots of bartenders representing many
temperaments, but now I have one to top them all.
A 11 ir>nd of mine and I were travelling through Bakers

field not so long ago when it was easily 140 degrees
in the coolest part of town. We stopped for a refresher
at one of the hotel lounges, and true to Stanford tra
dition, ordered the beer. The bartender scowled and
asked us why we couldn't order something which
wasn't so simple to produce. Under questioning, he
explained:
"Well, you see, I'm not the run of the mill bartender,
see? I'm sort of like this fella Rembrandt, see? I
sorta take pride in mys?lf as an artist. I feel I'm
wasting my talents shoving beer or straight shots
across the bar. Them drinks is too easy to fix. Now
take a Martini, a Zomzie or an Old Fashioned. There
is something where I can use my artistic imagination
and express my genius. Mixing different types of
liquors is like a painter mixing different colors, see?
People hurt my artistic feelings when they don't ask
me to mix something tough. I guess I'm too much an
artist to be in this racket."
Our patron of the arts then took his leave with the
forlorn look of a San Francisco apartment dweller who
has just been evicted for the fifth time in two weeks.
My friend and I looked sheepishly at each other, and
hastily withdrew. We still wonder if our consciences
will ever be plagued with the gruesome thought that
we have boorishly insulted a sensitive and esthetic
master of true art.

Many of us were greatly impressed with "The Story
of G.I. Joe," now playing in Paly. Gone are the se
quences of hot pilots lounging in cocktail bars making
with the fast talk with their honeys of the moment.
Gone are scenes of the French Underground, which
always se°ms to come through in the pinches with a
photo finish. Gone are the shots of heroes returning
to embrace their wives, who so often come up with
the dewey-eyed, but cliche phrase, "I knew you'd come
back."
The Story of G.I. Joe pictures mud, defeat, lone
someness, fatigue and blood. This writer hopes the
full impact of the picture will not be lost in the post
war l'orgetfulness so typical of us Americans.

Well, B. 0., you're in a hot spot—literally! But, we
know you will get out of it. You are a dov/n to earth
farmer who won't take any guff from city slickers
lying down. So, put on your shoes, get up on your
feet and prepare to put the finger on the demons who
are holding you. Have patients, B. 0., your readers are
pulling for you. Soon as I send a wire to Tracy tipping
off your captor and whereabouts, you'll be safe. Have
patience, B. 0., Tracy is on the way!

Dick Driscoll. We all hope for the best, and a speedy
recovery, Dick.

with the fast talk with their honeys of the moment.
Gone are scenes of the French Underground, which

Well, B. 0., you're in a hot spot—literally! But, we
know you will get out of it. You are a dov/n to earth
farmer who won't take any guff from city slickers
lying down. So, put on your shoes, get up on your
feet and prepare to put the finger on the demons who
are holding you. Have patients, B. 0., your readers are
pulling for you. Soon as I send a wire to Tracy tipping
off your captor and whereabouts, you'll be safe. Have

OPEN LETTER TO MR. FRANK WALKER: There
is a big question among former Row women this
quarter regarding the current expense of room and
hoard. Briefly it is this: Many of the girls are
paying considerably more for room and hoard this
year than they did under the sorority system. They
are in a quandary because there are generally more
girls in the house this quarter, fewer hashers to
fetd, and a businesslike administration running the
show instead of one of the students. All of which
should make for more economy and less house ex
pense.
Under the old system, the girls often had the ex
pense of laundry and telephone service absorbed in
the initial house bill. In most cases, this expense
now must be handled by the individuals in the house.
In brief, the former Row women would like to know
(lie reason for (he added expense and the decrease
in bouse service, and just where the extra money
is going.

My intense studv of international law in the libe last
Sunday was interrupted with a laugh when the
Carillon suddenly burst out with a few choruses of
The Three Cabelleros. I'm looking forward with ex

Andrews Sisters can be procured for a quick Sun

Belgium Bells.

A London paper recently came out with the state

was convinced of it when I read a story Sunday con

I have run into lots of bartenders representing many
temperaments, but now I have one to top them all.
A 11 ir>nd of mine and I were travelling through Bakers

field not so long ago when it was easily 140 degrees
in the coolest part of town. We stopped for a refresher
at one of the hotel lounges, and true to Stanford tra
dition, ordered the beer. The bartender scowled and
asked us why we couldn't order something which
wasn't so simple to produce. Under questioning, he
explained:
"Well, you see, I'm not the run of the mill bartender,
see? I'm sort of like this fella Rembrandt, see? I
sorta take pride in mys?lf as an artist. I feel I'm
wasting my talents shoving beer or straight shots
across the bar. Them drinks is too easy to fix. Now
take a Martini, a Zomzie or an Old Fashioned. There
is something where I can use my artistic imagination
and express my genius. Mixing different types of
liquors is like a painter mixing different colors, see?
People hurt my artistic feelings when they don't ask
me to mix something tough. I guess I'm too much an
artist to be in this racket."
Our patron of the arts then took his leave with the
forlorn look of a San Francisco apartment dweller who
has just been evicted for the fifth time in two weeks.
My friend and I looked sheepishly at each other, and
hastily withdrew. We still wonder if our consciences
will ever be plagued with the gruesome thought that
we have boorishly insulted a sensitive and esthetic
master of true art.

at one of the hotel lounges, and true to Stanford tra
dition, ordered the beer. The bartender scowled and
asked us why we couldn't order something which
wasn't so simple to produce. Under questioning, he
explained:
"Well, you see, I'm not the run of the mill bartender,
see? I'm sort of like this fella Rembrandt, see? I
sorta take pride in mys?lf as an artist. I feel I'm
wasting my talents shoving beer or straight shots
across the bar. Them drinks is too easy to fix. Now
take a Martini, a Zomzie or an Old Fashioned. There
is something where I can use my artistic imagination
and express my genius. Mixing different types of
liquors is like a painter mixing different colors, see?
People hurt my artistic feelings when they don't ask
me to mix something tough. I guess I'm too much an
artist to be in this racket."
Our patron of the arts then took his leave with the
forlorn look of a San Francisco apartment dweller who
has just been evicted for the fifth time in two weeks.
My friend and I looked sheepishly at each other, and
hastily withdrew. We still wonder if our consciences
will ever be plagued with the gruesome thought that
we have boorishly insulted a sensitive and esthetic
master of true art.

Many of us were greatly impressed with "The Story
of G.I. Joe," now playing in Paly. Gone are the se
quences of hot pilots lounging in cocktail bars making
with the fast talk with their honeys of the moment.
Gone are scenes of the French Underground, which
always se°ms to come through in the pinches with a
photo finish. Gone are the shots of heroes returning
to embrace their wives, who so often come up with
the dewey-eyed, but cliche phrase, "I knew you'd come
back."
The Story of G.I. Joe pictures mud, defeat, lone
someness, fatigue and blood. This writer hopes the
full impact of the picture will not be lost in the post
war l'orgetfulness so typical of us Americans.

Well, B. 0., you're in a hot spot—literally! But, we
know you will get out of it. You are a dov/n to earth
farmer who won't take any guff from city slickers
lying down. So, put on your shoes, get up on your
feet and prepare to put the finger on the demons who
are holding you. Have patients, B. 0., your readers are
pulling for you. Soon as I send a wire to Tracy tipping
off your captor and whereabouts, you'll be safe. Have
patience, B. 0., Tracy is on the way!

My column today will terminate with an expression
of sympathy for our friend and servant of Stanford,
Dick Driscoll. We all hope for the best, and a speedy
recovery, Dick.
OPEN LETTER TO MR. FRANK WALKER: There
is a big question among former Row women this
quarter regarding the current expense of room and
hoard. Briefly it is this: Many of the girls are
paying considerably more for room and hoard this
year than they did under the sorority system. They
are in a quandary because there are generally more
girls in the house this quarter, fewer hashers to
fetd, and a businesslike administration running the
show instead of one of the students. All of which
should make for more economy and less house ex
pense.
Under the old system, the girls often had the ex
pense of laundry and telephone service absorbed in
the initial house bill. In most cases, this expense
now must be handled by the individuals in the house.
In brief, the former Row women would like to know
(lie reason for (he added expense and the decrease
in bouse service, and just where the extra money
is going.

My intense studv of international law in the libe last
Sunday was interrupted with a laugh when the
Carillon suddenly burst out with a few choruses of
The Three Cabelleros. I'm looking forward with ex

Andrews Sisters can be procured for a quick Sun
day afternoon performance, accompanied by the
Belgium Bells.

A London paper recently came out with the state

was convinced of it when I read a story Sunday con
cerning American treatment of Jews in Occupied
Europe. I guess it's just a case of going from one cage
