Russia. To all that means a sphinx, and to some, one
with a pair of cobra fangs. Yet it also means cold
political power, and plenty of it in the form of the Red
Army. In short, Russia is the one-word summary of
the question, "peace or war?"
More material is coming out about it. Yesterday, in
The Chronicle, we found Senator Pepper's interview
with Stalin, and it was quite significant.
Russia. says her premier, wants peace, and to get
along with America. lie adds, we need a new basis
for understandings, which is true, and also—and this
theme went throughout the interview—Russia needs
money.
Perhaps the basis of Russo-American understanding
is firmly implanted in Stalin's mind: "America has
money and we must have it." Perhaps not.
But our credits still stand as a trump card in the
London maneuverings. They can be used to forge an
understanding. But there are still questions of dispute,
and nothing can come out of it that will last until the
major powers get a settlement that they look upon as
fair. This, however, is not impossible.
BALKANS
The most obvious and publicized problem is the
Balkan question. Russia wants incorporate Europe's
little sticks of dynamite into some sort of sphere of
influence. Everybody else says no.
This could he settled, however, by a Danumian
economic and political bloc. It would forge the little
states into one big one, so that there would be no
question of a sphere of influence over it, and, since
its resources make it rich while its geography puts
it on the defensive, it would stand as an effective
check to central European aggression towards the
Mediterranean.
Of course, Russia would like a warm water port,
but she could be ceded one of the smaller Jugoslav
harbors, and allowed to build it up into one as well
as construct a trans-Balkan railway for commercial
purposes. Since, in case of. war, this port would be
isolated at the declaration, it would be no threat to
us, and it would show Russia that we are not trying
to muzzle her commerce.
POLAND AND MEDITERRANEAN
Russia demands Mediterranean colonies, and Britain
has fought for decades to keep her out of that area.
The best possible settlement in this respect would be
to give the Italian colonies to the British, and com
pensate Russia by giving her a completely free hand
in Poland.
The latter course would be highly controversial,
and two arguments would be raised against it. The
first is that we are giving cartc-blanche to a Russian
tyranny, and this is against our principles; the sec
ond, that we are giving Russia control of the in
dustries of Silesia, which is impractical.
But what we would do, really, would be to recognize
a fait accompli. The Russians on the Curzon line are
too near Warsaw to make the Poles go against them,
and they thus can impress any ministry in Poland
with the idea that the safest hostility is towards the
west.
GERMANY
There have been a lot of rumors that we intend to
weaken the Germans for security, but to leave them
something so they will be a buffer state against the
Soviet. This would cause ill feeling both in Fiance
and Russia, and, besides that, is a blunder.
If we follow this course, France and Russia will
come to a more thorough agreement, ostensibly for the
further partition of Geimany when the time is ripe.
Of course, Germany would be thrown into our camp in
such an event, but she would be rather useless to us
as she stands now.
Our wisest course is to give the French everything
they want in Germany—a demonstration of good
faith to Russia and a means of encouraging France
to stick with us. The reason for the latter is that she
will really have a stake in seeing that the powers
of the East don't get too much of a hand west of
the Elbe. And, granting a firmer alliance with her,
we can also state that if America and Britain sticks
together either will have enough of a margin of
power over her to keep her within our discretion.
Although this scheme is not just in its broader as
pect, this is a world of extremely little justice and
much less mercy, and the plan is not repressive to any
major power concerned. Because of the latter, it has
a good chance of lasting.
As for putting it ov( r, with the threat of loan stop
pa;;" in buck of it. that would be a lead pipe cinch.
