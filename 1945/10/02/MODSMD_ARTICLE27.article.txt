# Roble Life Can Have Oomph--—See '49ers
## Brains, Beauty In Present Crop; Frosh Yearn To Be Stanford Women 
### RENA JEAN BLACK 
Autumn quarter is well into its
second week, and the scared Fresh
man of the Jolly-Up and the Reg
Day I-want-to-go-home attitude,
have suddenly metamorphosed into
the yearly crop of Roble butterflies,
whose Queens of the Civ Libe give
many an upper-division lassie
wrinkles caused not by class work,
but by worry over her man.
This year's female Frosh have al
ready begun to impress Stanford
manhood with the truth of that old
Hindu philosophy that Life can be
beautiful. Besides the usual Fresh
man charm, the girls this fall have
the brains which enabled them to
pass the entrance requirements,
which have once again been raised
to pre-war standards.
From far Away
The present Roble model, class
of '49 style, is different in that many
of the girls are not only out-of
state, but are from foreign coun
tries. Betty and Muriel Weston, Ca
nadian citizens who lived in Eng
land diiVing the war, chose to attend
Stanford because the Registrar's
Officc. wrote such a nice reply to
their inquiries.
Evelyn Wythe, only recently re
leased from a Japanese prison camp
in the Philippines, and Ruth Suth
erland has come to the Farm from
her home in India. Octavia Pratt
is from Alaska, and several girls
hail from Canada and the New Eng
land states.
What Ever Happened to Them?
Roble is also home, this year, to
ten new sophomore students and to
returning transfers, who are old
enough hands at College life to know
that worry over Civ homework is
futile, and that the eager Frosh will
soon find out that 7:12 a.m. is early
enough to cringe out of bed for 7:15
breakfast.
The twelve official sponsors, head
ed by K. J. Supple, Roble presi
dent. are sorry for only one thing:
why did they ever mention that
business about being kissed on the

Quad in the moonlight? Now every
one wants to be a Stanford woman!
i Thf.se 256 new members of the
Farm family are firmly convinced
that Stanford was heaven-sent by
pixies or magic, for from all reports,
j everyone just loves L.S.J.U. Mrs.
Mort, that pleasant keeper of the
| Roble door at closing time, was
j heard to remark that "this year's
J Freshmen are the loveliest group of
j girls in a long time," and that they
! remind her of the "old" Stanford
! days.
Musical Hopes
If the crated harp, which is stored
| in Rcble's package room, is any cri-
I terion, the hall is definitely musical -
jly inclined. Plans are being made
for a Roble Orchestra, which will
be composed of any instruments
from oboes, cellos, and flutes, to
guitars, accordians, and harmonicas.
Nancy Pennvcook, sponsor, is in
charge of the Roble Formal which
will be held some time in November,
and she even hints of the possibili
ties of an open house. A Roble
j Glee Club is also planned.
Look for fine things to come from
this carefully chosen Freshman
class. They are the type of clean
cut, sturdy young womanhood who
will one day grow up to become
Roble Sponsors and crusaders against
staying up late, cutting classes, and
the observance of quiet hours—the
iiard way.
