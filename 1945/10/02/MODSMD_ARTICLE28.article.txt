# Army Reveals War Radio Transmitter
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 1 (UP).—
The Army, in another now-it-can
be-tolci story, today took the wraps
oft' the highly secret directional ra
dio transmitter which guided speed
ing American invasion forces in Eu
rope and the Pacific and may revo
lutionize civilian long-distance tele
phoning.
Atop a hill in the Presidio, Signal
Corps technicians demonstrated to
newsmen the Buck Rogerish device
—an interception - proof, high - fre
quency, highly mobile radio capable
of keeping up with the fastest mov
ing troops.
One of the greatest tasks, Army
spokesmen said, was keeping track
of Gen. George Patton's Third Army
in Europe. Lt. George M. Hickman,
Garden City, N.Y., and Sgt. F. W.
Niedt, Long Branch, N.J., who raced
along with Patton's forces, were
present to tell part of the slory.
Telephone lines. Army spokesmen
said, were too subject to sabotage
and low-frequency sets were not
practical because weather conditions
frequently "washed out" contacts.
This led to the development of
(he Army's AN TRC-6, a technically
complicated outfit that can send ra
dio waves to other stations wilh
bullet-like directness.
(According to Dr. H. H. Beverage,
associate director of RCA labora
tories which developed the system
in collaboration with the Camp Cole
signal agency, the operation will
eliminate the necessity of long lines
in long-distance telephone commu
nications.)
The equipment, weighing less
than 300 pounds and mounted on a
mobile truck, sends on a super
frequency band of 4,300 and 4,900
megacycle* about hall Ihe length
of a loud pencil.
