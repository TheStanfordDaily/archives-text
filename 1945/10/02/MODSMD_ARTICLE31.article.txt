# AST Echoes
## 
### JIM WELTER 
The title of this column might
well suggest the state of the army's
wing of Encina since the younger
generation of the unit, namely, the
ERC's, have returned to their
| mamas for a week of coddling. In
j plain English, the joint is so quiet
| now that if one lets loose with a
I burst of vehemence, he no longer
receives response from an ASTRP
neighbor, but is greeted only by his
own terrible echo.
Encina can now lay hold to the
old expression, "East is East; West
is West, and never the twain shall
meei" since the Farm's Frosh have
been herded into the East wing.
Walking eastward over the dividing
line could be compared to stepping
from a soundproof New York radio
studio into the din of Broadway.
All in all, though, we like the fel
' lows
No greater surprise—nor more
pleasant—has befallen the army boys
in recent times than the serenading
rendered by a group of coeds last
Wednesday night. A general ex
pression for the average opinion
would be "Give us more."
Apparently quite a few fellows
decided that the 1.00 part of the ratio
wasn't so bad and might demand
some exploration. Anyhow last Sat
urday night a fair sized number
took, what they at first thought
would be a dangerous chance, on a
Roble blind date. Your writer has
yet to hear of a case of dissatisfac
tion (on our part). Yours truly,
in fact, still is not able to believe
that, something so extraordinary
could happen to him. Even some
bashful civvies who decided to take
!in <ht dance as stags, soon saw
j their mistake and began unsuc
i cessful attempts to "borrow" the
Army's treasure. In case you
j missed it, the vote for the most
| energetic rug-cutter belonged to our
I Lt. Fagan.
Five ERC's left last night for the
Japanese-language program at Uni
versity of Minnesota. To them we
say—"Bin Voyage," which nowa
days means "I hope that you have
found a quicker way of getting a
discharge."
