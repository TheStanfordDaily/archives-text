# Army Begins Cage Season Wednesday
## 
### 
Wednesday night will mark the opening of the AST's intramural basket
ball season for the fall term. Heretofore din ing the present term, touch
football and volleyball were the extra-curricular athletic activities. The
recent return to standard time, however, means that it is dark by the time
that the games would be starting. There will be three leagues, two of

them representing the EM and one
the ERC's. The EM's loops will be
designated "A" and "C" since they
are primarily composed of men from
"A" and "C" companies, respectively.
These two leagues will have every
Wednesday night from 8:30 to 10:30
for their playing periods. ERC
teams, which won't be organized un
til next week when the ASTRP's
return from furlough, will play
their contests on Thursdays.
Each of the ASTRP leagues are
composed of six outfits. Those of
the "A" confederation are self
named; "Bums," "Shushies," "B.F.'s,"
"Atom-Bums," "Vita-Men," and
"Zippers." Aggregations of the "C"
loop have tagged themselves as
"The Lilly-Whiters," "Runts,"
"Coots," "The Giant Five," "A. T.
& Q. Club,"and "Chickens."
The games will be thirty minutes
in length with ten minute inter
missions between each fifteen min
ute halves. All contests are sched
uled to tako place in the men's
gymnasium with the playing across
court. This means a possibility of
three frays being played simultan
eously. Present plans call for two
games per court on each night., the
first set of tilts beginning at 8:45
and the second at 9:30.
Since there are but eight weeks
remaining in the term, time for only
one round of play is possible. Dur
ing the last three weeks, an elimi
nation tournament will be held
with the final winner receiving the
acclamation of Battalion Champion.
Prizes will be awarded to the mem
bers ol the winning five.

The games will be thirty minutes
in length with ten minute inter
missions between each fifteen min
ute halves. All contests are sched
uled to tako place in the men's
gymnasium with the playing across
court. This means a possibility of
three frays being played simultan
eously. Present plans call for two
games per court on each night., the
first set of tilts beginning at 8:45
and the second at 9:30.
Since there are but eight weeks
remaining in the term, time for only
one round of play is possible. Dur
ing the last three weeks, an elimi
nation tournament will be held
with the final winner receiving the
acclamation of Battalion Champion.
Prizes will be awarded to the mem
bers ol the winning five.
