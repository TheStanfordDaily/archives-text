### ED GIESECKE 
As autumn on the Indian campus
swings into full bloom, so do the
activities of the Stanford Gl-Joe,
who, aided by a little intestinal
fortitude, manages to escape the
pursuit of the slide rule and text
and fall into the lime-light frequent
ly, generally accompanied by a mem
ber ol Stanford's fairer sex.
Inconspicuous was the number of
ASTudents at Saturday's reg dance,
as compared with the large attend
ance of Navy ROTC's and civilian
students. Synonymously, the num
ber ol Army men at Encina hall is
slowly decreasing, due to grading
factors beyond their control. (As
the noble Brutus hath said—"so let
it not be with the eager-beaver.")
With the coming of old man
winter —which in California means
a slight let-up in sunshine —the sol
dier-students' garb will switch from
light sun tans to the olive drab
wool uniform. Purely a matter of
choice, the outer garment will be
the only wool worn by ninety per
cent of the men. But those few
who go "wool" all the way are still
around.
A news tid-bit relative to the
above may be summarized thusly:
"Stock up on Benzadrine, men; in
fluenza vaccine shots are coming in
the near future.
As fads come and go, the latest
GI thrills are seen in various shapes
and sizes dangling from Army
mouths. Some of the latest AST
pipes bear grotesque resmblance to
sine curves, while other pipe types
run oft into a tangent. These ardent
tobacco lovers manifestingly wor
ship such smoking and claim "the
pipe is responsible for the consti
ution of our masculine personalities."
As a hostess would say—"Your
hat and coat, sir. Must you go
now?'*—this column bows into the
past with "Thirty for Tuesday."
