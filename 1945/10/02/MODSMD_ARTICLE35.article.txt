Truman's recent request to Great
Britain that 100.000 Jews should be
admitted to Palestine, dispatches

exclusive statement to the United
Press, said that Iraq rejects the for
mation of a Zionist state.
"The first result would be the
entry into Palestine of 2,000.000
Jews," the premier said. "A second
result would be the creation of a
well-trained Jewish army of 300.000
men with a powerful air force. This
would be a great menace to the
neighboring Arab states which are
undeveloped along modern liens.
"If President Truman would real
ize all these facts, he would not side
with the Zionists against the Arabs.
We trust lie will take our views
into account as it is a matter of life
and death for us."
It was disclosed here that the Brit
ish sixth airborne division has been
transferred from Germany to Pales
