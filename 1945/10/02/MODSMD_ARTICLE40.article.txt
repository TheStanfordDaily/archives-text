# 'Vow Boy' Coffis Now Heads keesler Squad
## 
### BOB SLOBE Daily Sports Editor 
We received a letter from Gordon
Levy, former Daily sports editor and
president of the freshman class, now
stationed at Keesler Field in Mis
sissippi. Gordon, who once came up
against the problem of filling space
on the sports page, was kind enough
to enclose some clippings of former
Stanford gridiron greats who are
now at Keesler Field.
Coflis at Keesler
He mentions Jimmy Coffis, who
was one of the Vow Boys and played
in the Rose Bowl game of 1935
against Southern Methodist Univer
sity. Coffis is now head coach at
Keesler and he and his team are us
ing the same "T" formation that his
Indian '40 frosh team used, the for
mation that has spread like wildfire
throughout the colleges and high
schools of the United States since
Clark Shaughnessy popularized it in
coaching his Indian '40 eleven to the
Rose Bowl after winning nine
straight conference tilts.
Gordo also mentions Dick Palmer, j
soph star on the Shaughnessy Bowl I
team, who is leading the field as a j
candidate for a guard spot on the '
Keesler eleven. All in all Stanford
seems to be well represented down
in the deep South and thanks to
Gordo we have found out what some I
of our former stars are doing these |
days.
Let its tell y*u more about Gor
don Levy. Gordo was the boy
who copped both the 100 and 220
for the Olympic Club at California
last year after having only high
school experience. Come track
season. Stanford will really be able
to use a boy like that. The army 1
cut his career short but he will
be back one of these days, and j
sports fans will be hearing of
Gordon Levy again.
He is really interested in Stan
ford's athletic program as evidenced j
by the last paragraph of his letter. |
Sees Sports Boom
"From what I hear. Stanford is
on its way back come basketball
season—that sounds like the real
*2tuff for once. Maybe the Daily
sports pages will resume their pre
war size once again. The only
time I ever saw those was when

I went back through the big black
files. Sports are on the boom
again—and (he Dippy sports page
will likewise boom. I saw most
of your papers this summer, and
you fellows really did a damn
good job—keep up (he good work.
Only a few months now and you
will have outlasted the draft."
Thanks a lot, Gordo; we hope you
are right about the above state
ments—including the draft.


JIMMY COFFIS, former Vow
Boy. now mentor at Keesler
Field.
