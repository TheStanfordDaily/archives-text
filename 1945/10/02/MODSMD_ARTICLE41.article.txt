# Tigers, Cubs In Series Tilt
## 
### STU MILLAR 
(This is (he first of two articles
about this years World Series.)
BULLETIN â€” Hal Newhouser
and Hank Borowy were last night
definitely named to oppose each
other in tomorrow's World Series
opener. Weather reports indicate
that clear weather will dry Ihe
rain-soaked grounds of Briggs
Stadium by late tomorrow.

j After almost five months of day in
day out strain, the answer to the
question that has plagued every
horsehide fan in the nation has been
answered.
The first peace-time World Series
in four years will find the Bengals
from the American loop pitted
against the Bruins of the senior cir
cuit. Over fifty thousand fans are
expected to bulge Briggs Stadium
in Detroit tomorrow to witness the
premier game of the annual base
ball titanic.
Steve O'Neil, manager of the Ti
gers, will have a trio of high-class
hurlers to juggle during the Series.
Hal Newhouser, 25-game winner;
Dizzy Trout, who took 18; and A 1
Benton, with 13 victories, are the
work-horses of the staff. Both Trout
and Newhouser have been bothered
j with back trouble during the close
pennant race and Benton has never
reached peak form after his mid
season leg fracture.
"Jolly Chollie" Grimm, Cub pilot,
has five quality chuckers to choose
from. Hank Borowy, $100,000 peach
l who came to Chicago in mid-season
from the Yankees and won 11 games
including the title-clincher against
Pittsburgh; Hank Wyse, 22 - game
j winner; Clyde Passeau, veteran with
17 on the right side of the ledger;
Paul Derringer, with 16; and Ray
Prim, who won 13. are the big quin
tet.
Behind the plate the Cubs again
have a wealth of material. Dewey
Williams, Paul Gillespie, Mickey
Livingston and Len Rice all have
seen service this season.
But the Tigers do not have to take
a back seat in quality. Paul Rich
ards, one of the smartest receivers
in the game, will probably start. An
other veteran backstop, Bob Swift,
will be in the dugout.
The Senators slipped to a game
and a half behind the winners in
the final standings when Hank
J Greenberg clouted a soaring, four
| run round-tripper to beat St. Louis
I Sunday.
