### AL SCIARONI 
Well, we see that Ted Kenfield,
the vaunted Cal football player, and
the Stanford Axe are back on the
sports page. The local sports writers
are once again engaged in the sport
of throwing slams at the Axe and
the punishment handed down to
| Kenfield.
Kenfield is (he Cal supporters'
one excuse for the Bears' loss to
Wedemeyer and Co. and the men
of Troy. They all seem to think
that the men from Berkeley would
be "the" team of the coast if Ken
j field were eligible to play.
History of Case
Let's review the case of Kenfield
and the Axe for those who are not
familiar with it. Last quarter Ken
field, Roger Harding, another ex-Cal
footballer, and some other boys at
tempted to steal the Axe. For this
' violation of the Stanford-Cal Axe
pact Kenfield and Harding were
banned from the first half of Cal's
I season.
Harding joined a pro club after
the penalty, but Kenfield stuck it
out. The Bay Area papers flayed
1 the stiff penalty without avail. Now
they are in the fight again saying
that Kenfield shouldn't be penalized
j "just for trying to steal an old axe"
i or "the Stanford meat chopper."
> Relations at Stake
In the first place we don't like
the way the Axe is referred to,
but more important is the fact
that they are criticizing the pen
alty. Stanford and Cal have a pact
which outlaws the stealing of the
Axe. This pact has probably done
more than anything else to bring
about better relations between the
two schools. If Kenfield was al
lowed to break the pact without
punishment so should others. If
this happened our relations with
Cal would have gone back to the
pre-pact days of vandalism. This
is a thing neither school wishes.
Last weeks the Stanford Excom
approved a plan to write a letter to
President Sproul of California rec
j ommending leniency in the case of
I Kenfield. Its about time the local
sport scribes drop the affair instead
j of trying to break down good fgeel
j ings between the two schools.
Harness Racing
Your reporter went down to the
harness races at Bay Meadows last
week. It was the first time that har
ness racing, with pari-mutuel win
dows open, had been held in this
| vicinity for a number of years.
Ihe ponies were some of the
best in the country, and ran some
exciting heats. It is considerably
easier to win a few dollars at the
harness races than it is at the
horse races seeing that there are
only an average of five entries in
each race. I came out S3.(JO ahead
for the day instead of going into
the minus as is usually the case
at horse races.
Ths track down at Meadows isn't
especially good for harness racing,
but the turnout was so large that
plans are being made to construct
| a special track for harness racing in
the Bay Area. With a full racing
program planned for next year the
prospects of a new track are good.

i or "the Stanford meat chopper."
> Relations at Stake
In the first place we don't like
the way the Axe is referred to,
but more important is the fact
that they are criticizing the pen
alty. Stanford and Cal have a pact
which outlaws the stealing of the
Axe. This pact has probably done
more than anything else to bring
about better relations between the
two schools. If Kenfield was al
lowed to break the pact without
punishment so should others. If
this happened our relations with
Cal would have gone back to the
pre-pact days of vandalism. This
is a thing neither school wishes.
Last weeks the Stanford Excom
approved a plan to write a letter to
President Sproul of California rec
j ommending leniency in the case of
I Kenfield. Its about time the local
sport scribes drop the affair instead
j of trying to break down good fgeel
j ings between the two schools.
Harness Racing
Your reporter went down to the
harness races at Bay Meadows last
week. It was the first time that har
ness racing, with pari-mutuel win
dows open, had been held in this
| vicinity for a number of years.
Ihe ponies were some of the
best in the country, and ran some
exciting heats. It is considerably
easier to win a few dollars at the
harness races than it is at the
horse races seeing that there are
only an average of five entries in
each race. I came out S3.(JO ahead
for the day instead of going into
the minus as is usually the case
at horse races.
Ths track down at Meadows isn't
especially good for harness racing,
but the turnout was so large that
plans are being made to construct
| a special track for harness racing in
the Bay Area. With a full racing
program planned for next year the
prospects of a new track are good.
Well, we see that Ted Kenfield,
the vaunted Cal football player, and
the Stanford Axe are back on the
sports page. The local sports writers
are once again engaged in the sport
of throwing slams at the Axe and
the punishment handed down to
| Kenfield.
Kenfield is (he Cal supporters'
one excuse for the Bears' loss to
Wedemeyer and Co. and the men
of Troy. They all seem to think
that the men from Berkeley would
be "the" team of the coast if Ken
j field were eligible to play.
History of Case
Let's review the case of Kenfield
and the Axe for those who are not
familiar with it. Last quarter Ken
field, Roger Harding, another ex-Cal
footballer, and some other boys at
tempted to steal the Axe. For this
' violation of the Stanford-Cal Axe
pact Kenfield and Harding were
banned from the first half of Cal's
I season.
Harding joined a pro club after
the penalty, but Kenfield stuck it
out. The Bay Area papers flayed
1 the stiff penalty without avail. Now
they are in the fight again saying
that Kenfield shouldn't be penalized
j "just for trying to steal an old axe"
i or "the Stanford meat chopper."
