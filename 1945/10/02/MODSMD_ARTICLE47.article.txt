NO MAN or lIER OWN—Ends to
night at the Varsity Theatre.
"No Man of Her Own" is a hang
over from the Hooverian era of de

coats. Although
made in 1932, the
film has a brisk,
snappy quality
about it that
many of today's
strained efforts
lack. Clark Ga
ble and the late
Carole Lombard
are featured in
this ribald com-

cdy that bears no tracc of Hays of
fice tampering.
Gable is seen as a gentleman card
shark and Miss Lombard is cast
as a small town girl who does a
hit of angling for herself. When

the two meet there is naturally
more than a little sex splattered
over Ihe screen, which is certainly
refreshing when one considers the
tepid things that arc exhibited to
day.
Thei'e are numerous amazing in
cidents that dot the picture, para
mount of which occurs when Gable
makes some rather sturdy advances
toward Miss Lombard while the two
are in a library after closing hours.
And you'll enjoy that honeymoon
scene when the pair are in a Pull
man car.
Of course many technical advances
have been made since this picture
was made. Some of the film is just
plain crude and we of this genera
tion I suppose are entitled to laugh
at some of the picture's weaker mo
ments. But it is seldom that you
see a Hollywood vehicle with as
much punch as "No Man of Her
Own."

The Varsity's second attraction
is "St. Louis Blues," which limps
along on the strength of its title
song. The picture, made by Para
mount five years ago, features the
talents of Dorothy Lamour and
Lloyd Nolan, which leaves the film
as a minus quantity in this re
viewer's eyes. Matty Malneck's
Dixieland hand and some sepia
entertainers arc also thrown in to
divert your attention from Miss
Lamour.
The only worthwhile scene is the
one in which Lamour ciinibs out
of the river after an impromptu
swim and her dress is surprisingly
enough all dry. But this is hardly
a compensating factor when von
have to put up with Miss Lamour,
who speaks as though she had a
mouthful of hot mashed potatoes,
for 90 other minutes. —Dick Bower.
