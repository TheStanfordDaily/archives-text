## Vice-President Speaks of "Good Old Days" and Hopes for Coming Year 
### 
Ilere, freshmen, is a Stanford coed
who remembers the good old days
when the Farm was a man's school
and when the red and white was
still waving over the field. Char
mian Kolar is her name, and, for
general information, she is the new
ly elected vice-president of the A.S.-
S.U.

"Now is the time for Stanford to
maintain its stability," says the
vice-president. "This year will de
termine how well the Farm is going
to adjust itself to normal college
routine. We must not be too anxious
to gain back our pre-war activities.
They will come, and more so, when
we are ready for them."
Miss Kolar liked Stanford imme
diately as a freshman because she
was impressed by the title of Stan
ford "men and women" which even
the frosh were given. And, believe
it or not, native Californians, the
vice-president likes our climate.
I'oli Sci Major
Political science is Miss Kolar's
major and working in San Francisco
or Portland is her ambition. She
claims she was almost brought up in
a Camp Fire Girls' camp at which
she has been a counselor for the
past few summers. The vice-presi
dent's duties at camp ran to being
head of K.P. Portland is her home
town.
Linguist Kolar
Miss Kolar went to Europe at the
age of twelve and spent a great deal
of time in Holland, where she may
take a graduate year of study. When
asked about her ability to speak
Dutch, she said it consisted of say
ing, "Happy New Year, Grandfa
ther."
The vice-president has not always
wante dto be a Poli Sci major. When
she was at St. Helen's Hall in Port
land, she was interested in journal
ism, but a nerve-wracking year as
editor of the school paper changed
that ambition.
As a freshman, Miss Kolar was
president of Roble. She is a mem
ber of Cardinals and has worked as
the head of the Drives Committee,
chairman of the Soph Carnival, and
head of last year's Red Cross Drive.
She was also president of the Parnie
Storey House in 1944.
Miss Kolar likes her office of vice
president and even likes the work.
She added at this point that the
social calendar for autumn quarter
is gradually filling up and that this
year will be a good one for Stan
lord and the student body.
Goes to Cal, Too
She told about Cal's invitation to
go to Berkeley next week-end for

a conference of college presidents.
And, she added, Cal is being very
friendly. All the coast universities
are hoping to resume these prewar
conference®, she said.

the frosh were given. And, believe
it or not, native Californians, the
vice-president likes our climate.
I'oli Sci Major
Political science is Miss Kolar's
major and working in San Francisco
or Portland is her ambition. She
claims she was almost brought up in
a Camp Fire Girls' camp at which
she has been a counselor for the
past few summers. The vice-presi
dent's duties at camp ran to being
head of K.P. Portland is her home
town.
Linguist Kolar
Miss Kolar went to Europe at the
age of twelve and spent a great deal
of time in Holland, where she may
take a graduate year of study. When
asked about her ability to speak
Dutch, she said it consisted of say
ing, "Happy New Year, Grandfa
ther."
The vice-president has not always
wante dto be a Poli Sci major. When
she was at St. Helen's Hall in Port
land, she was interested in journal
ism, but a nerve-wracking year as
editor of the school paper changed
that ambition.
As a freshman, Miss Kolar was
president of Roble. She is a mem
ber of Cardinals and has worked as
the head of the Drives Committee,
chairman of the Soph Carnival, and
head of last year's Red Cross Drive.
She was also president of the Parnie
Storey House in 1944.
Miss Kolar likes her office of vice
president and even likes the work.
She added at this point that the
social calendar for autumn quarter
is gradually filling up and that this
year will be a good one for Stan
lord and the student body.
Goes to Cal, Too
She told about Cal's invitation to
go to Berkeley next week-end for

a conference of college presidents.
And, she added, Cal is being very
friendly. All the coast universities
are hoping to resume these prewar
conference®, she said.
