# Membership Still Open for Choir
## 
### 
The University Choir has been di
vided into two parts in order to
accommodate the great number of
students who have been approved
for membership. Next Sunday the
Chancel Choir will enter in proces
sion and sing an anthem without
accompaniment while the Gallery
Choir will sing a unison hymn
anthem with organ. They will join
to lead the congregational singing.
Membership is still open in the
Gallery Choir and tenors are espe
cially needed in both groups. Ap
pointments for voice trials may be
made for afternoons the week with
Dr. Wheelwright in the choir room.
