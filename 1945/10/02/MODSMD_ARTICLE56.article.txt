TOKYO, Oct. 1.-(UP). â€” Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur, undertaking the
greatest search for stolen goods in
history, today uncovered two huge
stores of treasure looted by the
Japanese from their overseas con
quests.
Americans under his direction
were looking for all Japanese war
booty of the last half century.
Shakcup Launched
To help in the search, Emperor
Hirohito personally launched a
shake-up of the vital Japanese cen
tral liaison council, which worked
out the demobilization of Japan's
army and navy, and is the Japanese
mechanism for carrying out Mac-
Arthur's orders, by appointing two
bankers as president and vice pres
ident
The emperor's advisers protested
strongly against the appointment of
bankers. But it was apparent that
Hirohito either had had his orders
from Mac Arthur or was acting vol
untarily.
Internal Unrest
Meanwhile, the first internal un
rest 01" the occupation developed in
northern Honshu. Minor riotous dis
turbances were staged by farmers in
protesting government demands that
they empty their larders to feed
bombed-out cities to the south.
Sleuthing American soldiers check
ing through the vaults of the bank
of Japan bound two stores of war
loot. One was gold from Indo-
China, which the Japanese had cred
ited to their federal reserve bank
of North China. The second was
gold and silver stocks from Siam.
