# 400.000 Idle In Labor Tie-Up
## New Disputes Offset By Strike Settlements 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 1 (UP).â€”New la
bor disputes throughout the nation
were virtually offset by discontin
uance of other strikes, leaving the
total number of workers idle as a
result of walkouts at approximately
400,000.
The crippling strike by 10,350
white collar workers ended at six
plants of the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation. The strike had made
another 28.000 production workers
idle during the three-week dispute,
and had cost the employees an es
timated $3,000,000 in wages.
Picket Lines
But in Dayton, 0., 12,000 General
Motors workers refused to cross
picket lines thrown around three
Frigidaire plants. The pickets were
set up by striking United Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers (CIO).
In the coal industry the prospects
were gloomy for winter stoves and
furnaces. The United Mine Work
ers and management were widening
the chasm between their opposing
claims. Five eastern Ohio coal mines
were shut down by picketing by
West Virginia and Pennsylvania
miners and more were expected to
close tomorrow with 10,000 Ohio
miners affected.
Refused to Meet
In Cleveland. 0., Ezra Van Horn,
chairman of the Bituminous Coal
Opecators Negotiation Committee,
refused to meet with the UMW until
36,000 striking Pennsylvania and
West Virginia miners go back to
the pits. Van Horn warned UMW
chieftain John L. Lewis that the
strikes should be called off "for the
good of the miners, operators and
our common country."
