PARIS, Oct. 1 (UP) â€”The Social
ist party won a solid victory far
surpassing the hope of party leaders
in the Cantonal elections, virtually
complete returns including those of
Sunday's run-off contests showed
today.
Figures from the ministry of in
terior covering all of France with
the exception of six cantons in Cor
sica, showed that while the Com
munists made substantial gains they
remained in third place. The de
pleted but still strong radical Social
ist party elected the second greatest
number of councillors in the cantons,
which resemble American counties.
The greatest surprise was the set
back of the old Radical-Socialist
party which had been the greatest
single political party of provincial
France. In the present elections they
owed a number of victories to their
electoral alliance with the Commun
ists who, in many cantons supported
Radical-Socialist candidates.
