History Changing
Commenting on the purpose of his
lecture Professor Robinson ex
plained that every passing year in
creases the subject matter of history.
Thus, history is always new, new
because of constantly appearing
points of view, discoveries, and ob
jectives of mankind.
"The record looks different to ev
ery succeeding generation," he said.
"Thirty-five years ago there was
much writing by American his
torians, notably James Harvey Rob
inson, Charles Beard, Frederick
Jackson Turner, on what they
termed "the new history." The
world they saw is now gone. It is
time for a restatement of the new
American history."
America Emphasized
Professor Robinson considers the
most significant changes since the
days of Robinson and Turner to be
the tremendous increase in detailed
subject matter, the greater emphasis
on the last half century, and the
wide dispersion of Americans and
American interests throughout the
world. Finally (and most important)
is the insistance on the story of
man's attempt to govern himself as
the all-important theme in 'the new
history.
