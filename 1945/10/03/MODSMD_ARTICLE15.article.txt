# Frosh to Give 'Bibles' Today
## 
### 
First come first served will be
the policy of the freshmen women
who will distribute the 1,100 copies
of the frosh bible, being made avail
able today to those students who
have not yet received a copy of the
145-46 edition.
The "bibles" will be given out
from the booth in front of the Cel
lar, one copy to a person. Since a
number are being saved for distri
bution in later quarters to incom
ing students, there will not be
enough copies for everyone, accord
ing to Nancy Banning, Cardinal
member in charge of the distribu
tion.
The frosh bible, or Stanford Hand
book, attempts to review and ex
plain the history, the organiations,
the activities and the essential spir
it of life at Stanford. The handbook,
a white book with a red block "S,"
is revised each year, and this year
was rewritten in its entirety by Edi
tor Nada Skidmore, and Assistant
Editor Beth Mac Vicar.
Roble women who will assist in
the distribution are as follows:
From 9 to 10 a.m., Amy Tye, Mar
garet Bacon, and Frances Fletcher;
from 10 to 11, Joan Allen and Diane
Reinle; and from 11 to 12 noon, Su
san Yonkon, Dabby Brooks, and
Derry Kimble.
