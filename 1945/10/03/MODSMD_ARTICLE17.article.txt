## VICTORY ON THE HOME FRONT 
### 
"Too little too late" assumed its place in
peace-time phraseology this week as Ira Mosher,
president of the National Association of Manu
facturers, said that he would urge that the na
tional labor-management conference, scheduled
for Nov. 5, be convened immediately so that a
remedy could be worked out before the nation's
economy "collapses because of strikes."
Mr. Mosher, it seems, could have made his
announcement a little earlier in the game—im
mediately after August 18, for instance, when
bolh labor and management had memories of
three years of arbitration through a strong tri
partite War Labor Board (a board that had the
power to enforce its orders) and were in the
mood for a conference. It appears now, how
ever, that Administration failure to announce
any policy or set up a board for arbitration to
replace the disintegrating WLB has created a
gap between end of war and reconversion pe
riods; meanwhile both industry and labor are
trying to outmaneuver each other to gain ad
vantageous positions in preparation for the far,
far distant Nov. 5 conference.
Presidential excuse for the delay seems to be
the reorganization and centralization now going
on in the Labor Department. Whether or not
the delay is worth it is questionable.
Whether Mr. Mosher's trip to Washington to
morrow will have any effect remains to be seen.
At any rate, his assertion that*"economic col
lapse and chaos" by November are possible be
cause of current disputes seems sadly true.

"Dear Mr. Wilson:
I wish to acknowledge your open letter which ap
peared in the October 2nd issue of the Stanford
Daily. In your letter you raise certain questions with
respect to the current charge for room and hoard in
the Lausen Houses. You indicate that the present
charge exceeds the cost for room and hoard during
the time when the sororities operated the houses.
I am very happy that you raise the question as
matters of this sort can better be understood by
all if the subject is full and frankly discussed.
Last Spring a Women's Housing Committee care
fully considered the question of the future operation
of the former sorority houses. In addition to recom
mending certain steps with respect to the problem
of room assignment, the Committee suggested in
Article (! that
'recommended that house bills be uniform in
all women's residences'
This principle was approved by the Dean of
Women and the President and adopted by the Board
of Trustees at the April 1!), IJJ4S meeting. Accord
ingly, a uniform charge of $193.00 per quarter is
now being made in all women's residences.
As the University has never had access to the
operating records of the former sorority houses
we have no wav of knowing how the present charge
compares with (he previous cost.
This is the background of the matter. Now as to
the present. The University regards this sort of
problem as a 'family matter.' It welcomes sug
gestions from the students looking to the betterment
of conditions. It also welcomes the opportunity of
discussing with the students, or appropriate com
mittees. any and all living problems. 1 understand
that the Women's Housing Committee is function
ing this quarter. If this Committee desires further
information, the University officials will gladly en
deavor to provide the facts, or in any other way co
operate with the Committee.
Sincerely yours, Frank F. Walker, Financial Vice
President."
Thank you very much for your promptness and con
sideration, Mr. Walker. We students appreciate the
information. Okay, gals, any more gripes can be
taken to the Housing Committee. The last one was
on me; you handle the next one.

Barbers are funny people. Every barber I've ever
run into has had a pet subject of discussion. My
barber at home has a trend of thought which ulti
mately ends up in the baseball world. At the begin
ning of the summer I did business with him, and
sure enough, by the time it came around to shampoo
time, he was off on a discourse about the Big Leagues.
Between the first and second rinse, I sputtered some
thing about. "How do you think Hank Greenberg will
do this season?" That was my first mistake. In order
to hear the full story on Greenberg, I had to have a
massage, a shoe shine and my sox washed. My barber,
we'll call him Gabby, emphatically declared Green
berg's experience in the Army would slow him down.
He said the "old man won't last the season out."
Realizing Gabby is a know-all in the baseball world
I made a five to one bet Detroit wouldn't be in the
running this season. Detroit—that's Greenberg's team,
you see. There's a payoff to this story but not for
me: Last weekend it seems that one Hank Greenberg
stepped up to the plate in the last of the ninth, with the
bases loaded, and pasted one into Section A, Row 87
of the grandstand, thus clinching the American League
pennant for his buddies. There go my five skins.
But worst of all, I was disillusioned in Gabby. Oh
well, like I said, barbers are funny people.

Realizing Gabby is a know-all in the baseball world
I made a five to one bet Detroit wouldn't be in the
running this season. Detroit—that's Greenberg's team,
you see. There's a payoff to this story but not for
me: Last weekend it seems that one Hank Greenberg
stepped up to the plate in the last of the ninth, with the
bases loaded, and pasted one into Section A, Row 87
of the grandstand, thus clinching the American League
pennant for his buddies. There go my five skins.
But worst of all, I was disillusioned in Gabby. Oh
well, like I said, barbers are funny people.

Our old friend, Miss Stevens, for many years at
tached to the A.S.S.U. office, now is using her talents
to full advantage as Dr. Sharp's secretary. We miss
you at your usual habitat, Stevie, but we're sure the
fellows aren't neglecting you over at Eneina. By the
way, I have a friend coming to Stanford next quarter,
and he said something to me about getting him lined
up in a room with a full view of Quad, private
bath
"Too little too late" assumed its place in
peace-time phraseology this week as Ira Mosher,
president of the National Association of Manu
facturers, said that he would urge that the na
tional labor-management conference, scheduled
for Nov. 5, be convened immediately so that a
remedy could be worked out before the nation's
economy "collapses because of strikes."
Mr. Mosher, it seems, could have made his
announcement a little earlier in the game—im
mediately after August 18, for instance, when
bolh labor and management had memories of
three years of arbitration through a strong tri
partite War Labor Board (a board that had the
power to enforce its orders) and were in the
mood for a conference. It appears now, how
ever, that Administration failure to announce
any policy or set up a board for arbitration to
replace the disintegrating WLB has created a
gap between end of war and reconversion pe
riods; meanwhile both industry and labor are
trying to outmaneuver each other to gain ad
vantageous positions in preparation for the far,
far distant Nov. 5 conference.
Presidential excuse for the delay seems to be
the reorganization and centralization now going
on in the Labor Department. Whether or not
the delay is worth it is questionable.
Whether Mr. Mosher's trip to Washington to
morrow will have any effect remains to be seen.
At any rate, his assertion that*"economic col
lapse and chaos" by November are possible be
cause of current disputes seems sadly true.

"Dear Mr. Wilson:
I wish to acknowledge your open letter which ap
peared in the October 2nd issue of the Stanford
Daily. In your letter you raise certain questions with
respect to the current charge for room and hoard in
the Lausen Houses. You indicate that the present
charge exceeds the cost for room and hoard during
the time when the sororities operated the houses.
I am very happy that you raise the question as
matters of this sort can better be understood by
all if the subject is full and frankly discussed.
Last Spring a Women's Housing Committee care
fully considered the question of the future operation
of the former sorority houses. In addition to recom
mending certain steps with respect to the problem
of room assignment, the Committee suggested in
Article (! that
'recommended that house bills be uniform in
all women's residences'
This principle was approved by the Dean of
Women and the President and adopted by the Board
of Trustees at the April 1!), IJJ4S meeting. Accord
ingly, a uniform charge of $193.00 per quarter is
now being made in all women's residences.
As the University has never had access to the
operating records of the former sorority houses
we have no wav of knowing how the present charge
compares with (he previous cost.
This is the background of the matter. Now as to
the present. The University regards this sort of
problem as a 'family matter.' It welcomes sug
gestions from the students looking to the betterment
of conditions. It also welcomes the opportunity of
discussing with the students, or appropriate com
mittees. any and all living problems. 1 understand
that the Women's Housing Committee is function
ing this quarter. If this Committee desires further
information, the University officials will gladly en
deavor to provide the facts, or in any other way co
operate with the Committee.
Sincerely yours, Frank F. Walker, Financial Vice
President."
Thank you very much for your promptness and con
sideration, Mr. Walker. We students appreciate the
information. Okay, gals, any more gripes can be
taken to the Housing Committee. The last one was
on me; you handle the next one.

Barbers are funny people. Every barber I've ever
run into has had a pet subject of discussion. My
barber at home has a trend of thought which ulti
mately ends up in the baseball world. At the begin
ning of the summer I did business with him, and
sure enough, by the time it came around to shampoo
time, he was off on a discourse about the Big Leagues.
Between the first and second rinse, I sputtered some
thing about. "How do you think Hank Greenberg will
do this season?" That was my first mistake. In order
to hear the full story on Greenberg, I had to have a
massage, a shoe shine and my sox washed. My barber,
we'll call him Gabby, emphatically declared Green
berg's experience in the Army would slow him down.
He said the "old man won't last the season out."

Thank you very much for your promptness and con

information. Okay, gals, any more gripes can be
taken to the Housing Committee. The last one was
on me; you handle the next one.

Barbers are funny people. Every barber I've ever
run into has had a pet subject of discussion. My
barber at home has a trend of thought which ulti
mately ends up in the baseball world. At the begin
ning of the summer I did business with him, and
sure enough, by the time it came around to shampoo
time, he was off on a discourse about the Big Leagues.
Between the first and second rinse, I sputtered some
thing about. "How do you think Hank Greenberg will
do this season?" That was my first mistake. In order
to hear the full story on Greenberg, I had to have a
massage, a shoe shine and my sox washed. My barber,
we'll call him Gabby, emphatically declared Green
berg's experience in the Army would slow him down.
He said the "old man won't last the season out."
Realizing Gabby is a know-all in the baseball world
I made a five to one bet Detroit wouldn't be in the
running this season. Detroit—that's Greenberg's team,
you see. There's a payoff to this story but not for
me: Last weekend it seems that one Hank Greenberg
stepped up to the plate in the last of the ninth, with the
bases loaded, and pasted one into Section A, Row 87
of the grandstand, thus clinching the American League
pennant for his buddies. There go my five skins.
But worst of all, I was disillusioned in Gabby. Oh
well, like I said, barbers are funny people.

Our old friend, Miss Stevens, for many years at
tached to the A.S.S.U. office, now is using her talents
to full advantage as Dr. Sharp's secretary. We miss
you at your usual habitat, Stevie, but we're sure the
fellows aren't neglecting you over at Eneina. By the
way, I have a friend coming to Stanford next quarter,
and he said something to me about getting him lined
up in a room with a full view of Quad, private
bath
"Too little too late" assumed its place in
peace-time phraseology this week as Ira Mosher,
president of the National Association of Manu
facturers, said that he would urge that the na
tional labor-management conference, scheduled
for Nov. 5, be convened immediately so that a
remedy could be worked out before the nation's
economy "collapses because of strikes."
Mr. Mosher, it seems, could have made his
announcement a little earlier in the game—im
mediately after August 18, for instance, when
bolh labor and management had memories of
three years of arbitration through a strong tri
partite War Labor Board (a board that had the
power to enforce its orders) and were in the
mood for a conference. It appears now, how
ever, that Administration failure to announce
any policy or set up a board for arbitration to
replace the disintegrating WLB has created a
gap between end of war and reconversion pe
riods; meanwhile both industry and labor are
trying to outmaneuver each other to gain ad
vantageous positions in preparation for the far,
far distant Nov. 5 conference.
Presidential excuse for the delay seems to be
the reorganization and centralization now going
on in the Labor Department. Whether or not
the delay is worth it is questionable.
Whether Mr. Mosher's trip to Washington to
morrow will have any effect remains to be seen.
At any rate, his assertion that*"economic col
lapse and chaos" by November are possible be
cause of current disputes seems sadly true.

"Dear Mr. Wilson:
I wish to acknowledge your open letter which ap
peared in the October 2nd issue of the Stanford
Daily. In your letter you raise certain questions with
respect to the current charge for room and hoard in
the Lausen Houses. You indicate that the present
charge exceeds the cost for room and hoard during
the time when the sororities operated the houses.
I am very happy that you raise the question as
matters of this sort can better be understood by
all if the subject is full and frankly discussed.
Last Spring a Women's Housing Committee care
fully considered the question of the future operation
of the former sorority houses. In addition to recom
mending certain steps with respect to the problem
of room assignment, the Committee suggested in
Article (! that
'recommended that house bills be uniform in
all women's residences'
This principle was approved by the Dean of
Women and the President and adopted by the Board
of Trustees at the April 1!), IJJ4S meeting. Accord
ingly, a uniform charge of $193.00 per quarter is
now being made in all women's residences.
As the University has never had access to the
operating records of the former sorority houses
we have no wav of knowing how the present charge
compares with (he previous cost.
This is the background of the matter. Now as to
the present. The University regards this sort of
problem as a 'family matter.' It welcomes sug
gestions from the students looking to the betterment
of conditions. It also welcomes the opportunity of
discussing with the students, or appropriate com
mittees. any and all living problems. 1 understand
that the Women's Housing Committee is function
ing this quarter. If this Committee desires further
information, the University officials will gladly en
deavor to provide the facts, or in any other way co
operate with the Committee.
Sincerely yours, Frank F. Walker, Financial Vice
President."
