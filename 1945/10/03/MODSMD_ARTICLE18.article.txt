# "THE WAY TO A MAN'S HEART"

Wilh peace came renewal of sports, with
pcace came a pre-war Gaieties, but with peace
didn't ccme a change in Stanford's men's eat
ing facilities.
For a university the size of Stanford, with ex
cellent facilities in almost every field, the con
dition of suitable men's dining halls is deplor
able.
Freshman students have no choice as to
whether they will eat at a dining hall or grub
around at the Cellar or off-campus. They are
required to eat at Encina Commons. As the
quality of Encina food is not now under ques
tion, comments on this are better left unsaid.
For the rest of the students, sophomores
through seniors and graduate students, the
choice is wide. A few pre-Meds eat at Lin
coln Hail; the others wait in line at the Cellar,
the Union, or Palo Alto. The amount of time
standing in line for meals is seemingly equiv
alent to a four-unit course.
It would perhaps be understandable if the
University did not have the facilities to feed
the men, but every Row hall has adequate room
and kitchen space to relieve the Cellar "bread
line."
Reportedly this week a move is underway
io re-open one of the Row halls for eating pur
poses. The move was instigated by the students
alone and if arrangements are completed, the
students are to be highly commended.
But until the Cellar "bread line" is relieved,
students, faculty, secretaries, day-students, and
visitors alike will spend half their lunch hour
in line and the other half trying to put up with
the understandably undermanned, overtaxed
Cellar facilities, because of the lack of men's
dining facilities.â€”Bob Peck.
