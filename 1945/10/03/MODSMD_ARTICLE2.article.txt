# Stanford YWCA Drive Increases Membership
## 'Y' Secretary Trained in Chile, London, Geneva 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
The "Y's" "Miss Pat" was pert
and gracious, as she found herself
caught between the stove and the
cupboard of the Women's Clubhouse
kitchen for an interview, while Stan
ford women poured through the
door for the "Y's" "Get Acquainted"
tea.
"Miss Pat," more formally Miss
Patricia Davidson, is the quick and
smiling executive secretary of the
Stanford YWCA who has time to
translate illegible writing and ans
wer questions.
"And she speaks Spanish beau
tifully," was the contribution of
Louise Phillips, who now works with
"Miss Pat," as president of the "Y."
"This is the first time I have
worked with students in the YWCA,"
said "Miss Pat," speaking of her
five years at Stanford. These five
years, and the five I worked in
Chile, I consider my most exciting
periods of "Y" work.
"Miss Pat" worked in Santiago,
Chile, through the University of
Chile, and in Valparaiso, where she
organized the city YWCA.
"I was a business woman, before
I entered "Y" work," she explained.
"I took my training at the YWCA

training school in New York, which
has some work in connection with
Columbia University, and the Union
Theological Seminary."
After work in the United States,
"Miss Pat" continued in London,
at tiie London School of Social
Work and the University of Switz
erland at Geneva.
"Home" to Miss Davidson, is Ari
zona, although she now lives on
Salvatierra near the campus.
"The "Y" membership has risen
every year since "Miss Pat's" been
here,' 'said Louise Phillips, a fact
which the executive secretary had
failed to report.
"Miss Pat" followed Mrs. Waldo
Chamberlain in Stanford "Y" work
in 1940, coming from San Jose.
More enthusiastic about YWCA
than her own experiences, "Miss
Pat" volunteered, "the "Y" here on
the campus is one of the oldest and
most continuously effective organi
zations at Stanford, with the gen
erous support of the administration."
"Miss Pat just had time to add
"The Stanford "Y" was formed one
year after the school was founded,"
as the inevitable line of "Y" work
ers with problems began to form.
