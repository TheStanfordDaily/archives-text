### ELIOTT EPSTEEN 
Empire, glory, and machine guns. This is the com
bination that is roaring in Indo China, in Java, and
shows signs of spreading to the whole, repressed
orient.
The Annamite nationalists in Saigon were shot at by
the French, and the Annamites returned the favor by
shooting at everybody with a white skin. A Japanese
army, larger than both sides, is roaming around the
country in armored trucks and cars, taking sides with
one side or the other depending on what individual
unit commanders think about it.
Gurkah patrols are covering the streets. British are
firing mortar shells into armed crowds. Americans have
had a new baptism of fire here. French reinforce
ments are on the way, and De Gaulle is in favor
of keeping his empire.
JAVA
Japanese in Java put the local nationalists in power
to help quiet the islands. Now the Japanese have
nothing to say about the area any more, and things
are heading towards a split between those in charge
—the natives —and those who want to get back in—
the Dutch.
The only real question so far is that of the armament
ratio between the natives and European troops, and
anybody knows how that stands. Thus, they should
re-establish far-eastern empire shortly.
SIGNIFICANCE
As for the significance of all this, Norman Thomas
would say that China would tend to support the local
groups when she was strong enough, and Russia would
co-operate, thus bringing about the long dreaded war
between East and West. But Norman Thomas' idea
on imperialism is sentimental, and his arguments are
more justifications than anything else.
The fact of the matter is that China needs a lot
of helping hands to prevent intervention from all
% sides until she can develop, and thus she has a stake
in seeing that the European empires around her are
re-established. The reason is that if they aren't, the
major powers of Europe will have less stake in and
less ability to help her maintain her independence.
Thus Chungking is laconic about the whole affair.
JAPAN
It also has a significance in Japan. Wc are saying
to them, during the occupation, that it Ls immoral for
them to have an empire, while our Allies themselves
are maintaining one. This puts another impediment
in our way to accomplishing a Utopia for the Japanese,
but our chances were very slight, anyway.
Rut we also have a stake in Empire. We take a
gamble that Japan can be reformed, and even at the
risk of loosing some of the force of our moral argu
ment, we keep Japan checked at less cost to our
selves if we maintain the British, Dutch, and French
in the Pacific.
For they all now realize that Japan in Manchuria
might mean that she is closer to Singapore, that
the Hankow-Canton railroad leads direct to Indo
China. Thus, we have nations in Europe who will
worry more and more about the Pacific, and will
put up war material with us to convince her that
aggression doesn't pay.
