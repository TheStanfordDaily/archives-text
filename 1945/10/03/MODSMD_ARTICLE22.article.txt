"Books for Russia," recently-or
ganized campaign to help restock
the war-devastated libraries of Rus
sia, is asking students and faculty
members to contribute books to the
fund during its fall and winter
drive.
The Stanford Bookstore has been
named as one of the collecting de
pots for contributions, and a box
has been placed at the end of the
typewriter department to collect do
nations. «
Tresidder Chairman
Named as chairman for the North
ern California area of the nation
wide drive are President Donald B.
Tresidder of Stanford, and Dr. Rob
ert Gordon Sproul, president of the
University of California.
Six Stanford faculty members are
acting as sponsors for the local
drive, Palo Alto publicity headquar
ters announced recently. They are
Dr. Roger Barker, Dr. Haroid H.
Fisher, Dr. Henry Lanz, Dr. Albert
Guerard, Dr. James Mcßain, and
Dr. Frank Weymouth.
Stanford is working in coopera
tion with Palo Alto during the cam
paign. Chairman of the Palo Alto
"Books for Russia" committee is Dr.
Harry B. Reynolds, retired physician.
Classics Needed
Books of permanent value, such
as the "Classics," are mainly de
sired for the campaign, although
technical and scientific books pub
lished since 1926 are also welcome.
Donors are asked to choose books
which they think represent the Am
erican and British way of life; cheap
novels and propagandists works are
not desired, the committee an
nounced.
In a statement written while he
was in Moscow, Dr. Sproul said:
"Books for Russia" project can do
much to cultivate understanding and
develop friendship among the peoples
of the United States and the Soviet
Union. Helping to restore Russia's
emptj library shelves with Ameri
can and English literature will build
lasting cultural ties and contribute
thereby to mankind's hopes for
peace."
Books Destroyed
According to Chairman Reynolds,
over 23 million volumes were stol
en or destroyed by the Germans in
the Russian Soviet Socialist Repub
lic alone. Many of these books were
in English, and can be immediately
replaced only through the generosity
of the American people, he added.
The English language has become
compulsory in secondary schools of
the laige Russian cities, Dr. Rey
nodls said, and books for which the
committee appeals are therefore
"all the more desperately needed."
The campaign will be carried on
in schools, libraries, churches, and
clubs of Palo Alto, with depots also
established at the South Palo Alto
Branch Library, the Palo Alto Com
munity Center, and Russian Relief
headquarters at 540 Emerson Street.

emptj library shelves with Ameri

lasting cultural ties and contribute

peace."
Books Destroyed
According to Chairman Reynolds,
over 23 million volumes were stol
en or destroyed by the Germans in
the Russian Soviet Socialist Repub

in English, and can be immediately
replaced only through the generosity
of the American people, he added.
The English language has become
compulsory in secondary schools of
the laige Russian cities, Dr. Rey
nodls said, and books for which the
committee appeals are therefore
"all the more desperately needed."
The campaign will be carried on
in schools, libraries, churches, and
clubs of Palo Alto, with depots also
established at the South Palo Alto
Branch Library, the Palo Alto Com
munity Center, and Russian Relief
