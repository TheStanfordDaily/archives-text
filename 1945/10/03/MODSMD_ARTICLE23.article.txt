LUENEBURG, Oct. 2 (UP).—Bee
tle-browed Josef Kramer, the noto
rious "beast of Belsen," today de
scribed as "untrue from beginning
to end" every charge of cruelty
made against him by inmates of the
Oswiecim and Belsen concentration
camps, where several million per
sons died at the hands of the Nazis.
His denial was made in a state
ment signed by him and read be
fore a British military court. Kra
mer sat with downcast head among
the 44 other Nazis on trial for their
lives as war criminals as the state
ment, introduced by the prosecution,
was being read.
Kramer said he had volunteered
for the SS in 1932 but was detailed
for duty at a concentration camp
"for which I did not volunteer."
Kramer estimated there were
from 350 to 500 deaths weekly in his
section at Oswiecim where he was
in charge of a third of the nearly
100,000 inmates. He said he was
told that Belsen would be for the
sick only and that anyone in an
other camp who was ill for 10 to 14
days was transferred there.
He said when he went to Belsen
his understanding was that the
camp housed some 15,000 persons
and that it contained a crematorium.
Conditions grew steadily worse as
more prisoners came in until the
death roll was 400 to 500 per day.
