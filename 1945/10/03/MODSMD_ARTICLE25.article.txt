# Davis Asks Cooperation For Accident Prevention
## 
### BETTY BARLOW 
Located on the one-way street
oft Santa Teresa, the Stanford Po
lice Department could easily be mis
taken for a bicycle shop from the
number of bikes parked within the
door.
Chief of police Gordon Davis,
who has been a member of this
police department for 16 years,
heads the force of six men. Stan
ford has had its own police de
partment since 1928. There is a 24-
hour coverage of the campus seven
days a week with a police patrol
car always on duty, and a patrol
officer on foot, as well as one in the
car at night.
Car Problems
The office of the police depart
ment is open during normal busi
ness hours only, and, if an officer is
needed after these hours for an
emergency, he could be reached by
phoning 3131 at the Paly police de
partment, where the radio trans
mitter covering this district is lo
cated.
Conspicuous by its absence dur
ing the war years, the problem of
handling an increasing number of
students with cars plus the large
number of bicycles, all of which may
be on the street at once, is again
prominent. Chief of Police Davis
said that the willing cooperation
of the student body is needed to
pi-event serious accidents.
Cyclists should stay off the streets
at night unless they have lights or

reflectors on their bicycles, and they
should always ride on the proper
side of the street. Reflectors can
be obtained at the campus service
station.
Bike's Right of Way
"A few novice drivers are in evi
dence as is always the case at the
first of a new school year, and an
effort will be made to educate these
drivers as soon as possible," stated
Chief Davis. "Motorists are expect
ed to yield the right of way to
cyclists for reasons of safety under
any circumstances."
He also added for the benefit of
new students that cycling on quad
is prohibited at all times, and bikes
should not be ridden under the
arcades. Heavy penalties are pro
vided for this violation. Also a new
schedule of penalties is being drawn
up for motor vehicle violation;; to
discourage carelessness. We have
not had a traffic fatality on campus

in years, and even personal injury
accidents have been few and far
between, Chief Davis said. We
should cooperate with the police
department in trying to continue
our good record, he added.
Bike "Borrowing"
It it. not unusual for the police
department to receive as high as
five reports of bike thefts a day.
This unauthorized borrowing of an
other's property takes many hours
of the force's time to locate and
i return bicycles. The majority of
the bike thefts are with girls' bi
cycles.
Chiel Davis asked that pedestrians
going to and from Paly use the
sidewalks on either side of Palm
Drive. Those wishing a ride should
stand at the recognized places at
the ends of the Drive.
V-J Souvernirs
Aside from the regular duties,
i the police department has recov
ered from one of the men's halls a
large bronze sign with about $75
taken from the Flood building in
San Francisco on V-J Day, and a
neon Chevrolet sign.

This unauthorized borrowing of an
other's property takes many hours
of the force's time to locate and
i return bicycles. The majority of
the bike thefts are with girls' bi
cycles.
Chiel Davis asked that pedestrians
going to and from Paly use the
sidewalks on either side of Palm
Drive. Those wishing a ride should
stand at the recognized places at
the ends of the Drive.
V-J Souvernirs
Aside from the regular duties,
i the police department has recov

large bronze sign with about $75
taken from the Flood building in
San Francisco on V-J Day, and a
neon Chevrolet sign.


GORDON DAVIS, Stanford
chief of police.
Located on the one-way street
oft Santa Teresa, the Stanford Po
lice Department could easily be mis
taken for a bicycle shop from the
number of bikes parked within the
door.
Chief of police Gordon Davis,
who has been a member of this
police department for 16 years,
heads the force of six men. Stan
ford has had its own police de
partment since 1928. There is a 24-
hour coverage of the campus seven
days a week with a police patrol
car always on duty, and a patrol
officer on foot, as well as one in the
car at night.
Car Problems
The office of the police depart
ment is open during normal busi
ness hours only, and, if an officer is
needed after these hours for an
emergency, he could be reached by
phoning 3131 at the Paly police de
partment, where the radio trans
mitter covering this district is lo
cated.
Conspicuous by its absence dur
ing the war years, the problem of
handling an increasing number of
students with cars plus the large
number of bicycles, all of which may
be on the street at once, is again
prominent. Chief of Police Davis
said that the willing cooperation
of the student body is needed to
pi-event serious accidents.
Cyclists should stay off the streets
at night unless they have lights or

reflectors on their bicycles, and they
should always ride on the proper
side of the street. Reflectors can
be obtained at the campus service
station.
Bike's Right of Way
"A few novice drivers are in evi
dence as is always the case at the
first of a new school year, and an
effort will be made to educate these
drivers as soon as possible," stated
Chief Davis. "Motorists are expect
ed to yield the right of way to
cyclists for reasons of safety under
any circumstances."
He also added for the benefit of
new students that cycling on quad
is prohibited at all times, and bikes
should not be ridden under the
arcades. Heavy penalties are pro
vided for this violation. Also a new
schedule of penalties is being drawn
up for motor vehicle violation;; to
discourage carelessness. We have
not had a traffic fatality on campus

in years, and even personal injury
accidents have been few and far
between, Chief Davis said. We
should cooperate with the police
department in trying to continue
our good record, he added.
Bike "Borrowing"
It it. not unusual for the police
department to receive as high as
five reports of bike thefts a day.
