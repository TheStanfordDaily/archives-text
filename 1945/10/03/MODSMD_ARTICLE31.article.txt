(Second of two stories on this year's World Series)

BULLETIN: Charlie Grimm, manager of the National League champions,
the Chicago Cubs, last night announced his intention to start Roy Hughes
in place of Len Mcrullo at the shortstop position in this afternoon's World
Series opener.

Charlie Grimm, head man of the |
Bruins, and Steve O'Neil, top-kick
of the home team Detroit Tigers,
each predicting a six-game series,
fans can look forward to a drawn
out afi'air.
Teams Reach Top Shape
Players previously hampered by j
injuries are returning to shape. On |
the Bengal side, Hurricane Hal New
houser has his back filled with co
caine to deaden the pain of a shoul
der growth, Hank Greenberg has
recovered from a wrenched ankle,
Edide Mayo is feeling his "best in
two months" after a shoulder in
jury, and Dizzy Trout is raring to
go in and blow down those invaders
from the Windy City after a mid
season back injury.
Ovei in the rival camp. Don John
son, only Cub horsehider not in tip
top shape has been pronounced
ready to start after being hampered
by a neck injury.
Continuing yesterday's review of
the strengths and weaknesses of the
two clubs, the Daily will today dis
cuss the infields and outfields.
Solid Bengal Outfield
In the outer garden for the Ben
gals will be "Hankus Pankus"
Greenberg, who has walloped thir- j
teen round-trippers since his return
from the service a short time ago, !
Doe Cramer, veteran and depend
able center fielder, and Roy Cullen
bine, hard-hitting fly-chaser. 01'
the three, Greenberg sports the
heftiest batting average, .305. Cul
lenbine and Cramer hit .272 and
.274 respectively during regular
American League competition.
On paper the Cubs will present
a more formidable trio with Harry
"Peanuts" Lowrey in right, "Handy"
Andy Pafko in center and either
Bill "Swish" Nicholson or Hank
Sauer in left. Lowrey powdered the
pill for a .282 average during the
National loop season, Pafko hit .299
besides bashing in over 100 counters,
Nicholson, way off last year's bat
ting and home-run-hitting form,

finished with .245, and Sauer, used
only sparingly, hit .267.
Cub Infield solid
The Cubs also show slight batting
superiority in the infield. National
league batting king, Phil Cavaretta,
will start at the initial sack. His
. 3. r >s bested Tommy Holmes in a
tight race for honors. Johnson, once
again at the keystone position, hit
an even .300. 'Merullo, short field
er, connected for a .233 average. Re
liable Stan Hack, in the twilight
of a career as one of the great hot
cornel men of all time, once again
was over the .300 mark, this time
by .022 digits.
Steve O'Neill will probably start
Rudy York, .272, at first, Mayo,
dynamic sparkplug of the nine all
season who hit .286, Skeeter Webb,
. 198, at short and Bobby Maier,
.264 r.t third.
Tigers' Terrible Trio
But batting averages don't often
tell the complete truth. Although
the Cubs present somewhat of a
Murderers' Row with heavy guns
dotting the batting order from top
to bottom, when such sluggers as
Greenberg, York, and Cullenbine
start putting together those long
smashes for which they are feared
by junior circuit hurlers batting
averages are meaningless.
Daily Takes Detroit
Because they are a clutch ball
club—they proved that when they
took a crucial clash from the Browns
on the last day of the season —and
beca'use of their ability to hit the
long ball, the Daily sports staff is
picking the Tigers to cop the series.

On paper the Cubs will present
a more formidable trio with Harry
"Peanuts" Lowrey in right, "Handy"
Andy Pafko in center and either
Bill "Swish" Nicholson or Hank
Sauer in left. Lowrey powdered the

National loop season, Pafko hit .299
besides bashing in over 100 counters,
Nicholson, way off last year's bat
ting and home-run-hitting form,

finished with .245, and Sauer, used
only sparingly, hit .267.
Cub Infield solid
The Cubs also show slight batting
superiority in the infield. National
league batting king, Phil Cavaretta,
will start at the initial sack. His
. 3. r >s bested Tommy Holmes in a
tight race for honors. Johnson, once
again at the keystone position, hit
an even .300. 'Merullo, short field
er, connected for a .233 average. Re
liable Stan Hack, in the twilight
of a career as one of the great hot
cornel men of all time, once again
was over the .300 mark, this time
by .022 digits.
Steve O'Neill will probably start
Rudy York, .272, at first, Mayo,
dynamic sparkplug of the nine all
season who hit .286, Skeeter Webb,
. 198, at short and Bobby Maier,
.264 r.t third.
Tigers' Terrible Trio
But batting averages don't often
tell the complete truth. Although
the Cubs present somewhat of a
Murderers' Row with heavy guns
dotting the batting order from top
to bottom, when such sluggers as
Greenberg, York, and Cullenbine
start putting together those long
smashes for which they are feared
by junior circuit hurlers batting
averages are meaningless.
Daily Takes Detroit
Because they are a clutch ball
club—they proved that when they
took a crucial clash from the Browns
on the last day of the season —and
beca'use of their ability to hit the
long ball, the Daily sports staff is
picking the Tigers to cop the series.

(Second of two stories on this year's World Series)

BULLETIN: Charlie Grimm, manager of the National League champions,
the Chicago Cubs, last night announced his intention to start Roy Hughes
in place of Len Mcrullo at the shortstop position in this afternoon's World
Series opener.
Willi latest odds leaning more and more toward the Chicago Cubs, tension

is mounting for the first game of the*
annual baseball classic's this after
n o o 11. with guitar - strumming |
Charlie Grimm, head man of the |
Bruins, and Steve O'Neil, top-kick
of the home team Detroit Tigers,
each predicting a six-game series,
fans can look forward to a drawn
out afi'air.
Teams Reach Top Shape
Players previously hampered by j
injuries are returning to shape. On |
the Bengal side, Hurricane Hal New
houser has his back filled with co
caine to deaden the pain of a shoul
der growth, Hank Greenberg has
recovered from a wrenched ankle,
Edide Mayo is feeling his "best in
two months" after a shoulder in
jury, and Dizzy Trout is raring to
go in and blow down those invaders
from the Windy City after a mid
season back injury.
Ovei in the rival camp. Don John
son, only Cub horsehider not in tip
top shape has been pronounced
ready to start after being hampered
by a neck injury.
Continuing yesterday's review of
the strengths and weaknesses of the
two clubs, the Daily will today dis
cuss the infields and outfields.
Solid Bengal Outfield
In the outer garden for the Ben
gals will be "Hankus Pankus"
Greenberg, who has walloped thir- j
teen round-trippers since his return
from the service a short time ago, !
Doe Cramer, veteran and depend
able center fielder, and Roy Cullen
bine, hard-hitting fly-chaser. 01'
the three, Greenberg sports the
heftiest batting average, .305. Cul
lenbine and Cramer hit .272 and
.274 respectively during regular
American League competition.
On paper the Cubs will present
a more formidable trio with Harry
"Peanuts" Lowrey in right, "Handy"
Andy Pafko in center and either
Bill "Swish" Nicholson or Hank
Sauer in left. Lowrey powdered the
pill for a .282 average during the
National loop season, Pafko hit .299
besides bashing in over 100 counters,
Nicholson, way off last year's bat
ting and home-run-hitting form,

finished with .245, and Sauer, used
only sparingly, hit .267.
Cub Infield solid
The Cubs also show slight batting
superiority in the infield. National
league batting king, Phil Cavaretta,
will start at the initial sack. His
. 3. r >s bested Tommy Holmes in a
tight race for honors. Johnson, once
again at the keystone position, hit
an even .300. 'Merullo, short field
er, connected for a .233 average. Re
liable Stan Hack, in the twilight
of a career as one of the great hot
cornel men of all time, once again
was over the .300 mark, this time
by .022 digits.
Steve O'Neill will probably start
Rudy York, .272, at first, Mayo,
dynamic sparkplug of the nine all
season who hit .286, Skeeter Webb,
. 198, at short and Bobby Maier,
.264 r.t third.
Tigers' Terrible Trio
But batting averages don't often
tell the complete truth. Although
the Cubs present somewhat of a
Murderers' Row with heavy guns
dotting the batting order from top
to bottom, when such sluggers as
Greenberg, York, and Cullenbine
start putting together those long
smashes for which they are feared
by junior circuit hurlers batting
averages are meaningless.
Daily Takes Detroit
Because they are a clutch ball
club—they proved that when they
took a crucial clash from the Browns
on the last day of the season —and
beca'use of their ability to hit the
long ball, the Daily sports staff is
picking the Tigers to cop the series.
