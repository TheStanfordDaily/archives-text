## Coast Football Schedule Goes Into Second Week 
### ART LEVINSON 
Gazing through our powerful
telescope atop the Hoover Libe, we
find the following things going on
at the various football fields up and
down the Pacific Coast.
In Eugene, Tex Oliver, who was
just recently released from the
Navy, is putting hi< Webfeet boys
through some pretty hard prac
tices, trying to have them brush
up on the new T-twist formation,
Oliver's own innovation.
Next Saturday they meet the
University of Idaho Vandals, in
what shouldn't be too much of a
test. Both schools have been out of
gridiron circles for several years,
but Idaho, always a weak sister,
isn't faring any better now. or so
reports have it from the Northwest.
Best gridder on the Eugene squad
is Bob Reynolds, a Negro flash who
played in 1942. He is one of the top
ground-gainers on the coast. Jake
Leicht, top ace of a few years back,
has failede to put in an appearance
yet, and there is a rumor making
the rounds that he might enroll on
the Trojan campus in Los Angeles.
Strictly scuttlebutt, though. . . .
Oregon Staters Injured
Over at Corvallis, still in swampy
territory of Oregon, Lon Stiner is
trying to work up an adequate de
fense against the T-formation that
they'll run against in the name of
Washington State next Saturday.
Oregon State played to a 14-14
tie with Camp Beale team last Sat
urday, and the squad is still nurs
ing injuries received in the tilt.. Key
men hurt were Buster Hollings
berry, a menter; fullback Bob Ste
vens; and Dick Gray, another back
field man. None, however, got too
much of a pummeling, so all are
expected to see action in the next
fracas. . . .
Golden Bear Notes
Turning our sights still farther
north, we reach to the "U. of W."
campus in Seattle. Pest Welch,
mentor of the squad, is training the
boys hard for a pass defense against
California, whom they meet next
Saturday in Berkeley. Why a pass
defense, we don't know, for that is
Cal's most inadequate department.
One bright spot to Washington is a
17-year-old youngster named Nor
man Sansregret. He romped all over

the field against Oregon last week
end.
At Berkeley the crocodile tear de
partment closed shop Monday with
the arrival of Billy Agnew, a triple
threat backfield man who played
for Stanford in 1941 before depart
ing for the Army. Whether he'll be
in chape for the Saturday game
against Washington is another
thing.
While on the subject of Cal.
they stumbled to a new low last
Saturday when they jobbed the
Axe yell for the second time in
two weeks. But U.S.C., which had
a fair rooting section, made this
classy retort after they pulled off
the yell: "Ilello, Stanford!''
California then buried their heads
in deep shame.
U.C.L.A. has a breather this Fri
day night when they face the Col
lege of Pacific, the team handled by
the grand old man, Amos Alonzo
Stagg. Cal Rossi is developing into
one of the finer backs on the coast,
along with Jackie Porter and Roy
Kurrasch. The Uclans pulled a
gridiron upset last Saturday when
they defeated the Naval Training
Station aggregation.
Watch out for Laßrucherie's boys
this year. They might be the team
to beat U.S.C., which looked most
umpressive in their win over Cal.
Jeff Cravath is having his hands
full over Trojan way. Lillywliite,
Tannehill, and Cole, all rst-string
backfield men, are out with injuries.
How they will cope with the St.
Mary's Pre-Flight attack next week
is Cravath's number one headache
at the moment.
St. Mary's, which already has the
best backfield on the coast, has re
ceived another topflight man in the
person of Henry van Gieson, a star
in 1943. He also hails from Hono
lulu, like his compatriots Wede
meyer and Cordeiro.
This week the PlieTan boys run up
against the University of Nevada,
in what looks to be the best game
in this region. The Nevadans have
apowerful line, headed by Bob Mc-
Clure, a player of All-American
caliber. They have met with more
than fair success this season, and
the Sunday fray at Kezar ought to
be most interesting.

in 1943. He also hails from Hono
lulu, like his compatriots Wede
meyer and Cordeiro.
This week the PlieTan boys run up
against the University of Nevada,
in what looks to be the best game
in this region. The Nevadans have
apowerful line, headed by Bob Mc-
Clure, a player of All-American
caliber. They have met with more
than fair success this season, and
the Sunday fray at Kezar ought to
be most interesting.
Gazing through our powerful
telescope atop the Hoover Libe, we
find the following things going on
at the various football fields up and
down the Pacific Coast.
In Eugene, Tex Oliver, who was
just recently released from the
Navy, is putting hi< Webfeet boys
through some pretty hard prac
tices, trying to have them brush
up on the new T-twist formation,
Oliver's own innovation.
Next Saturday they meet the
University of Idaho Vandals, in
what shouldn't be too much of a
test. Both schools have been out of
gridiron circles for several years,
but Idaho, always a weak sister,
isn't faring any better now. or so
reports have it from the Northwest.
Best gridder on the Eugene squad
is Bob Reynolds, a Negro flash who
played in 1942. He is one of the top
ground-gainers on the coast. Jake
Leicht, top ace of a few years back,
has failede to put in an appearance
yet, and there is a rumor making
the rounds that he might enroll on
the Trojan campus in Los Angeles.
Strictly scuttlebutt, though. . . .
Oregon Staters Injured
Over at Corvallis, still in swampy
territory of Oregon, Lon Stiner is
trying to work up an adequate de
fense against the T-formation that
they'll run against in the name of
Washington State next Saturday.
Oregon State played to a 14-14
tie with Camp Beale team last Sat
urday, and the squad is still nurs
ing injuries received in the tilt.. Key
men hurt were Buster Hollings
berry, a menter; fullback Bob Ste
vens; and Dick Gray, another back
field man. None, however, got too
much of a pummeling, so all are
expected to see action in the next
fracas. . . .
Golden Bear Notes
Turning our sights still farther
north, we reach to the "U. of W."
campus in Seattle. Pest Welch,
mentor of the squad, is training the
boys hard for a pass defense against
California, whom they meet next
Saturday in Berkeley. Why a pass
defense, we don't know, for that is
Cal's most inadequate department.
One bright spot to Washington is a
17-year-old youngster named Nor
man Sansregret. He romped all over

the field against Oregon last week
end.
At Berkeley the crocodile tear de
partment closed shop Monday with
the arrival of Billy Agnew, a triple
threat backfield man who played
for Stanford in 1941 before depart
ing for the Army. Whether he'll be
in chape for the Saturday game
against Washington is another
thing.
While on the subject of Cal.
they stumbled to a new low last
Saturday when they jobbed the
Axe yell for the second time in
two weeks. But U.S.C., which had
a fair rooting section, made this
classy retort after they pulled off
the yell: "Ilello, Stanford!''
California then buried their heads
in deep shame.
U.C.L.A. has a breather this Fri
day night when they face the Col
lege of Pacific, the team handled by
the grand old man, Amos Alonzo
Stagg. Cal Rossi is developing into
one of the finer backs on the coast,
along with Jackie Porter and Roy
Kurrasch. The Uclans pulled a
gridiron upset last Saturday when
they defeated the Naval Training
Station aggregation.
Watch out for Laßrucherie's boys
this year. They might be the team
to beat U.S.C., which looked most
umpressive in their win over Cal.
Jeff Cravath is having his hands
full over Trojan way. Lillywliite,
Tannehill, and Cole, all rst-string
backfield men, are out with injuries.
How they will cope with the St.
Mary's Pre-Flight attack next week
is Cravath's number one headache
at the moment.
St. Mary's, which already has the
best backfield on the coast, has re
ceived another topflight man in the

Jeff Cravath is having his hands
full over Trojan way. Lillywliite,
Tannehill, and Cole, all rst-string
backfield men, are out with injuries.
How they will cope with the St.
Mary's Pre-Flight attack next week
is Cravath's number one headache
at the moment.
St. Mary's, which already has the
best backfield on the coast, has re
ceived another topflight man in the
person of Henry van Gieson, a star
in 1943. He also hails from Hono
lulu, like his compatriots Wede
meyer and Cordeiro.
This week the PlieTan boys run up
against the University of Nevada,
in what looks to be the best game
in this region. The Nevadans have
apowerful line, headed by Bob Mc-
Clure, a player of All-American
caliber. They have met with more
than fair success this season, and
the Sunday fray at Kezar ought to
be most interesting.
Gazing through our powerful
telescope atop the Hoover Libe, we
find the following things going on
at the various football fields up and
down the Pacific Coast.
In Eugene, Tex Oliver, who was
just recently released from the
Navy, is putting hi< Webfeet boys
through some pretty hard prac
tices, trying to have them brush
up on the new T-twist formation,
Oliver's own innovation.
Next Saturday they meet the
University of Idaho Vandals, in
what shouldn't be too much of a
test. Both schools have been out of
gridiron circles for several years,
but Idaho, always a weak sister,
isn't faring any better now. or so
reports have it from the Northwest.
Best gridder on the Eugene squad
is Bob Reynolds, a Negro flash who
played in 1942. He is one of the top
ground-gainers on the coast. Jake
Leicht, top ace of a few years back,
has failede to put in an appearance
yet, and there is a rumor making
the rounds that he might enroll on
the Trojan campus in Los Angeles.
Strictly scuttlebutt, though. . . .
Oregon Staters Injured
Over at Corvallis, still in swampy
territory of Oregon, Lon Stiner is
trying to work up an adequate de
fense against the T-formation that
they'll run against in the name of
Washington State next Saturday.
Oregon State played to a 14-14
tie with Camp Beale team last Sat
urday, and the squad is still nurs
ing injuries received in the tilt.. Key
men hurt were Buster Hollings
berry, a menter; fullback Bob Ste
vens; and Dick Gray, another back
field man. None, however, got too
much of a pummeling, so all are
expected to see action in the next
fracas. . . .
Golden Bear Notes
Turning our sights still farther
north, we reach to the "U. of W."
campus in Seattle. Pest Welch,
mentor of the squad, is training the
boys hard for a pass defense against
California, whom they meet next
Saturday in Berkeley. Why a pass
defense, we don't know, for that is
Cal's most inadequate department.
One bright spot to Washington is a
17-year-old youngster named Nor
man Sansregret. He romped all over

the field against Oregon last week
end.
At Berkeley the crocodile tear de
partment closed shop Monday with
the arrival of Billy Agnew, a triple
threat backfield man who played
for Stanford in 1941 before depart
ing for the Army. Whether he'll be
in chape for the Saturday game
against Washington is another
thing.
While on the subject of Cal.
they stumbled to a new low last
Saturday when they jobbed the
Axe yell for the second time in
two weeks. But U.S.C., which had
a fair rooting section, made this
classy retort after they pulled off
the yell: "Ilello, Stanford!''
California then buried their heads
in deep shame.
U.C.L.A. has a breather this Fri
day night when they face the Col
lege of Pacific, the team handled by
the grand old man, Amos Alonzo
Stagg. Cal Rossi is developing into
one of the finer backs on the coast,
along with Jackie Porter and Roy
Kurrasch. The Uclans pulled a
gridiron upset last Saturday when
they defeated the Naval Training
Station aggregation.
Watch out for Laßrucherie's boys
this year. They might be the team
to beat U.S.C., which looked most
umpressive in their win over Cal.
