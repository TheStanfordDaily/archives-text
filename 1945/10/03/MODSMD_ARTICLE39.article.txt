# Dean Calls First Drill
## 
### 
The opening session of fall basket
ball practice will get under way this
afternoon at 4:15 p.m. on the soccer
field when Coach Everett Dean looks
over his casaba prospects and runs
them through their first workout.
While most of the material is un
known and untried, Coach Dean is
hopeful of shaping a Redman quin
tet that will be able to cope with
any five in the P.C.C. Southern
Division.
