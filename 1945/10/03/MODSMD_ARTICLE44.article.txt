# Constitution Unifies Student Government at Stanford
## 
### 
(This is another in a series of ,
articles dealing with the student
government under the new con
stitution in trial use today. It
deals with the organization of stu
dent administrative bodies and the
housing committee (story on page
one.)
The new A.S.S.U. constitution
seeks to bring the various agencies
of student control and administra
tion into a clear pattern. The agen
cies themselves have existed and
have been incorporated into consti
tutions through a program of evolu
tion of student government.
The Executive Committee, with
its area representatives, president
and vice-president elected at large,
and various ex - officio members
without vote, has legislative power
to draw up all rules by which or
ganized student activities are gov
erned.
Excom Powers
Student publications, law enforce
ment, athletics, dramatics, debate,
music, and women's social activities
exist under the Executive Commit
tee to administer in their special
fields. They have complete rule

making power within their fields,
consistent with over-all rules of the
A.S.S.U. Executive Committee.
Housing Committee is a sub
group of Women's Conference, one
of these administrative boards. It
was created at the request of the
University administration to de
termine what was to be the status
of the former sorority houses.
Housing Committee
The committee drew up a plan
which was accepted in its entirety
and without change by the Board
of Trustees and the committee then
was made a permanent sub-com
mittee of Women's Conference
which has rule-making power over
the social activities of women stu
dents.
Housing Committee under the
chairmanship of Mary Lou McClure,
former A.S.S.U. vice-president, is
the body which can hear complaints
about the housing policy or vio
lations of it, plans the social orien
tation program among living groups,
and recommends changes and re
ports on the success of the housing
arrangements.
Women's Conference, itself, is

composed of all presidents of cam
pus living groups. It has rule
making power over women's social
activities in so far as the rules are
consistent with Excqm and Univer
sity regulations.
Women's Conference
Women's Conference has evolved
from a separate organization, once
independent, exclusively for women
and governing their affairs. Incor
porated into a general student body
organization long ago, under the
new constitution it is further
brought under a general scheme of
government as an administrative
board whose rules are absolute un
less vetoed by the president and a
majority of the Excom, or two
thirds of Excom members without
the approval of the president.
Next: other administrative
boards.)
