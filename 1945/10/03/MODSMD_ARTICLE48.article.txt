# Color Photography Says 'Go to A laska'
## Karl Robinson Shows Tuesday Series Crowd Scenic Wonders of the North 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
Stressing the need for knowledge
about Alaska, Karl Robinson, ex
plorer, photographer, and inhabitant
of the territory for many years, last
night gave a capacity Tuesday Series
audience a closeup view of the "we"
who "live in Alaska" and a pano
ramic view of the snow capped and
wooded lakes of America's last
frontier.
Following the change of season
frome the ice breakup in early
spring until the bird's flight south
in late autumn, Mr. Robinson's ex
cellent color photography portrayed
the birds, beasts, flowers and inci
dentally the people, who make Alas
ka, temporarily or otherwise, their
home.
Go North Young Man!
Youth is characteristic of the men
and women who come North, he
said, showing a young Swiss couple
and their Alaska-born child, culti
vating their land in scenery remi
niscent of the Alp. The land is fer
tile. Mr. Robinson said, in an area
of 70,000 square miles, being suit
able for most crops except corn
and such as require a long hot
season.
The nine-year-old colony at Mata
nuska is built on fertile silt land
deposited by a glacial river. Homes

there differ little from the average
American home, he said, showing
a scantily clad young woman water
ing her victory garden.
Studying and Camping
College, Alaska, is a modern uni
versity town. Other groups of young
people of assorted complexions and
ages trek out in a sleek, new bus
to spend two weeks camping, swim
ming, and working together.
Construction of the Alaskan high
way has been taken over by the
army and greatly advanced, but Mr.
Robinson did not advise vacationing
in the region yet because tourist
living would still be on the primi
tive side.
Botanist's Paradise
Wild flowers make Alaska a bot
anists' paradise, Mr. Robinson said,
and the animalsâ€”caribou, grizzlies,
mountain sheep, to name a few
make interesting camera studies.
Army men, and men and women
brought to the region to work on
government projects have swelled
the population temporarily. The
soldiers have met Russians, spent
their leisure hours riding, hiking,
wiener-roasting at Mt. McKinley,
met and visited the people who live
in Fairbanks and, he said, many
have expressed the wish to come
back and make Alaska their home.
Mr. Robinson was introduced by
Charles N. Reynolds, professor of
sociology.
