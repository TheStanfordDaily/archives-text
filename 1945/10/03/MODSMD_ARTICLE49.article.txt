# Debaters Plan Fall Program
## 
### 
With 18 new members joining the
old-timers, the Stanford Debate So
ciety got under way yesterday by
outlining the quarter's program.
Work will begin immediately on a
question that has been selected for
nation - wide collegiate discussion
this year: "Resolved: That the pol
icy of the United States should be
directed toward free trade among
the nations of the world."
''Many of the new members have
debating experience.e They repre
sent a great variety of interests and
backgrounds, coming here from
Montana and Brazil, Texas and New
York. This will enable us to re
cover from the wartime inactivity
and have a very busy year," said
Pat Blair, debate manager.
Professor Emerson, retiring fac
ulty adviser, reviewed the history
of the society and pointed out that
much emphasis has successfully
been placed on extemporaneous
speaking, particularly in the an
nual JofTre debate with the Uni
versity of California.
"We have been victorious in com
petition against Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and English universities
although we have avoided knock
down, drag-out tactics," he ex
plained.
Discussing the quarter's work.
Professor Chapin, new faculty ad
viser, pointed out that since debat
ing requires a great deal of time
as the season progresses students
may take it for credit.
The group will meet again to
morrow afternoon at 4:30 in room
200T of the History building.
