# Nitery Shut, 'Poor Usage'
## 
### 
Because the Nitery has had such
continued poor usage, with coke
bottles, papers, and cigarettes con
sistently thrown on the floor and be
hind the Coke Bar, Cardinals plans
to c'ose it for a week, announced
Joan McDonough, president of the
organization.
Tho week's closing will be term
inated only if students voice their
interest and cooperation in keeping
the Nightery a place to which par
ents and guests may be taken with
pride, rather than with apologies.
During the week's closing janitors
will clean the room, and an effort
will be made to make the upholstery
presentable. The Coke Bar will also
be removed.
Miss McDonough said the Nitery
had been a problem for some time,
and that if students did not think
enough of it to act like Stanford men
and women while using it, then
Cardinals would close the traciit|>nal
cokc room permanently.
The closing will begin some time
this week, possibly today. Any sug
gestions for an orderly administra
tion of the Nitery by the students
will be welcomed by Cardinals.
