FRANKFURT, Germany, Oct. 2
(UP). —Gen. George S. Patton, Jr.,
most colorful American field gen
eral of World War 11, was lelieved
of the command of his Third Army
and its occupation zone today be
cause he had permitted Nazis to
participate in the German civil gov
ernment for Bavaria.
An announcement from Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquar
ters made no mention of charges
that Patton had been lenient with
Nazis and indifferent to the plight
of displaced persons—it said only
that Eisenhower had notified Pat
ton of his transfer to command of
the U.S. Fifteenth Army Sept. 29.
The Fifteenth is an "army" in name
only and has no occupation zone.
Patton was summoned from his
headquarters at Munich Sept. 29 to
give an accounting to Eisenhower
of his stewardship in Bavaria. The
situation in Bavaria came to a head
early last week when Patton told
correspondents the complaints of
anti-Nazis that Nazis were in the
civil government were just a case
of the "outs fighting the ins" and
reminded him of the bickering be
tween Democrats and Republicans
in the United States.
The transfer relegated Patton to
command of an "army" which is !
virtually non-existent. Since July,
when it relinquished the Rhineland,
the Fifteenth has been a "phantom"
army consisting of little more than
a headquarters detachment which
has been assigned to compile and
write a report of American par
ticipation in the European war.
In his new post, Patton will have
no authority over the German civil
population. The handful of troops
he will command are stationed west j
of the Rhine, at Bad Neuenahr near j
the Remagen bridge, in the center j
of the French occupation zone. The
Fifteenth's headquarters remained
there when all its troops were dis
charged or redeployed in July.
Eisenhower's announcement said
Patton would be succeeded as |
Third Army commander and mili
tary governor of Bavaria by Lt. Gen.
Lucien K. Truscott, who led the
U.S. Fifth Army during part of the
Italian campaign. His appointment
will become effective on or about !
Oct. 7.
