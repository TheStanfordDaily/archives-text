# Everett Dean Returns From Rome; Plans California Basketball Series
## 
### BOB SLOBE Daily Sports Editor 
After returning from a three
month stay in Rome where he
worked on the army sports rehabili
tation program, head basketball
coach Everett Dean had a lot of
news—both new and old—for us to
day. When asked how he liked his
duties in Italy, he simply replied,
"I'm glad to be back home."
As one of the foremost coaches
in (he United States, Dean was
chosen to act as director of basket
ball in a school which taught G.l.'s
who were athletically minded how
to bring sports to all of the soldiers
who wanted to play, "It was a
pretty rough course," commented
Dean, "it lasted twelve hours a day
for Ihiee weeks with only Sundays
out."
Adequate Facilities Abound
"We had a marvelous setup to
teach (he boys there with plenty
of equipment for everyone," con
tinued Dean. The "setup" he
speaks of is the Italian Forum
built by Benito Mussolini, fascist
leader of Italy. It consists of two
great stadiums, swimming pools,
baseball diamonds—in fact there
were accommodations for every
sport.
"It was much better than any
thing I've seen here in this coun
try." he added. "About every
twenty feet or so there were huge
marble statues of former Italian
athletes. These were around the
rim of the marble stadium and
were about 15-1 X feet high."
Then we got on to the more im
mediate business of the basketball
team for this winter, and we found
out a little about the technique that
this soft-spoken coach is noted for.
As fat as material was concerned,
Coach Dean did not know much

more about the prospects than any
one rise who was exceedingly in
terested in our basketball future.
Knows Little About IWatcrial
"The only fellows whose names
I recognize arc those from last
season's gym class." This is a
pretty fair indication that Dean
will be starting with only very
raw material at his disposal, lie.
too, expressed (he opinion that
was printed in these pages not so
very long ago—the opinion that
Stanford would have a tough three
or four year uphill climb before
reaching their pre-war level in
athletics.
Coach Dean did not as yet know
anything about the conference
schedule, but, contrary to last
summer's report that Stanford

would not be able to enter the
conference because of transporta
tion difficulties, wc believe that
Stanford will definitely play a full
coast conference schedule.
Dean confirmed our hopes when
he helped rekindle a spark that
has been smoldering for three years
now when he stated, "Stanford will
play a California series for sure."
He went on to say, "If we can
get three or four good boys, and
fill in with the rest, we'll stay up
there with the rest of the schools.
Too, there may be three or four
experienced men in the Navy
R.O.T.C.
Practice Today
Practice will start today when the
gvm classes meet at the soccer field.
Coach Dean will commence by talk
ing to the players, and then they
will do a little running. His train
ing method consists of having his
players train outside for two or three
weeks during which they play vol
leyball, learn fundamentals, run,
and do other work that doesn't re
quire the actual shooting of baskets.
When asked why he didn't start
out with basketball practice right
away, Dean replied, "I think this
system puts the boys in better
shape, and gives them plenty of
zip when they actually do get on
the floor. They know they arc in
better shape for the running in
creases their stamina, and this
gives them a tremendous psycho
logical advantage over their op
ponents when they get into com
| petition."
Well, all we have to say is that
Dean's method sure must be a good
j one considering the top-notch teams
I he has developed while at Stanford
| and Indiana. Stanford students take
j heed, if a good basketball can be
I put o.i the hardwoods, Coach Everett
I Dean will do it.

EVERETT DEAN, head basket
ball coach, just returned fron
overseas.
After returning from a three
month stay in Rome where he
worked on the army sports rehabili
tation program, head basketball
coach Everett Dean had a lot of
news—both new and old—for us to
day. When asked how he liked his
duties in Italy, he simply replied,
"I'm glad to be back home."
As one of the foremost coaches
in (he United States, Dean was
chosen to act as director of basket
ball in a school which taught G.l.'s
who were athletically minded how
to bring sports to all of the soldiers
who wanted to play, "It was a
pretty rough course," commented
Dean, "it lasted twelve hours a day
for Ihiee weeks with only Sundays
out."
Adequate Facilities Abound
"We had a marvelous setup to
teach (he boys there with plenty
of equipment for everyone," con
tinued Dean. The "setup" he
speaks of is the Italian Forum
built by Benito Mussolini, fascist
leader of Italy. It consists of two
great stadiums, swimming pools,
baseball diamonds—in fact there
were accommodations for every
sport.
"It was much better than any
thing I've seen here in this coun
try." he added. "About every
twenty feet or so there were huge
marble statues of former Italian
athletes. These were around the
rim of the marble stadium and
were about 15-1 X feet high."
Then we got on to the more im
mediate business of the basketball
team for this winter, and we found
out a little about the technique that
this soft-spoken coach is noted for.
As fat as material was concerned,
Coach Dean did not know much

more about the prospects than any
one rise who was exceedingly in
terested in our basketball future.

"The only fellows whose names
I recognize arc those from last
season's gym class." This is a

will be starting with only very
raw material at his disposal, lie.
too, expressed (he opinion that
was printed in these pages not so
very long ago—the opinion that
Stanford would have a tough three

Coach Dean did not as yet know
anything about the conference
schedule, but, contrary to last
summer's report that Stanford

would not be able to enter the
conference because of transporta
tion difficulties, wc believe that
Stanford will definitely play a full
coast conference schedule.
Dean confirmed our hopes when
he helped rekindle a spark that
has been smoldering for three years
now when he stated, "Stanford will
play a California series for sure."
He went on to say, "If we can

athletes. These were around the
rim of the marble stadium and
were about 15-1 X feet high."
Then we got on to the more im
mediate business of the basketball
team for this winter, and we found
out a little about the technique that
this soft-spoken coach is noted for.
As fat as material was concerned,
Coach Dean did not know much

more about the prospects than any
one rise who was exceedingly in
terested in our basketball future.
Knows Little About IWatcrial
"The only fellows whose names
I recognize arc those from last
season's gym class." This is a
pretty fair indication that Dean
will be starting with only very
raw material at his disposal, lie.
too, expressed (he opinion that
was printed in these pages not so
very long ago—the opinion that
Stanford would have a tough three
or four year uphill climb before
reaching their pre-war level in
athletics.
Coach Dean did not as yet know
anything about the conference
schedule, but, contrary to last
summer's report that Stanford

would not be able to enter the
conference because of transporta
tion difficulties, wc believe that
Stanford will definitely play a full
coast conference schedule.
Dean confirmed our hopes when
he helped rekindle a spark that
has been smoldering for three years
now when he stated, "Stanford will
play a California series for sure."
He went on to say, "If we can
get three or four good boys, and
fill in with the rest, we'll stay up
there with the rest of the schools.
Too, there may be three or four
experienced men in the Navy
R.O.T.C.
Practice Today
Practice will start today when the
gvm classes meet at the soccer field.
Coach Dean will commence by talk
ing to the players, and then they
will do a little running. His train
ing method consists of having his
players train outside for two or three
weeks during which they play vol
leyball, learn fundamentals, run,
and do other work that doesn't re
quire the actual shooting of baskets.
When asked why he didn't start
out with basketball practice right
away, Dean replied, "I think this
system puts the boys in better
shape, and gives them plenty of
zip when they actually do get on
the floor. They know they arc in
better shape for the running in
creases their stamina, and this
gives them a tremendous psycho
logical advantage over their op
ponents when they get into com
| petition."
Well, all we have to say is that
Dean's method sure must be a good
j one considering the top-notch teams
I he has developed while at Stanford
| and Indiana. Stanford students take
j heed, if a good basketball can be
I put o.i the hardwoods, Coach Everett
I Dean will do it.
