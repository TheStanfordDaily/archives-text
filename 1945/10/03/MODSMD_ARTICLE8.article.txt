# Housing Group Hears Board Rates Report
## Rise in Cost Result of Increasing Food, Labor, Maintainance Expenses 
### 
Why has the cost of room and
board for women gone up consider
ably this quarter? This question
was discussed at yesterday's meet
ing of Housing Committee after the
reading of a report submitted by
Frank Walker, financial vicc-presi
dent of Stanford University.
This quarter is a 12-week quar
ter, whereas the quarters last year
were only ten weeks long. Also the
cost of food, labor, and other ex
penses has increased considerably.
The $195 that is paid for room and
board is being used for those ex
penses only—it is not being used to
pay off the debt on the newly pur
chased sorority houses, Mr. Walk
er's report stated.
More Explanation Needed
Housing Committee members de
cided there were still a number of
questions about the housing pro
gram and costs that they did not
understand. They will meet with
Mr. Walker shortly to get more ex
planation. Some of the questions to
be asked are:
Why has the cost of room and
board gone up so much just since
spring quarter? Is there a chance
of it going down? Why does it cost
the University more to operate the
Row houses than it did for these
houses to operate themselves?
Are Budgets Equal?
Do the budgets that are given to
all house directors allot the same
amount of money to every girl no
matter where she lives? Can there
be exchange dinners all over the
campus—not just between the large
University dining rooms? Why are
guest meals so expensive?
Will free phones be established
in the houses that have only pay
phones? Does the $195 go for any

thing besides room and board?
Room, Board Uniform
Room and board cost is uniform
in all the houses, Marylou McClure,
Housing Committee chairman, em
phasized. These questions have
been brought up because girls all
over the campus have been won
dering why room and board is more
expensive this quarter.
Dean Mary Yost and the presi
dents of the Row houses met re
cently to clear up any difficulties
that have arisen since the Univer
sity bought the houses.
The house mothers decide how
many hashers are needed in their
particular house, where they will
enter, and how they will act to the
girls. All regulation of the kitchen
is up to the house mother.
Houses Regulate Laundry
laundry service can be decided
upon in each house. Girls may ei
ther pool their laundry or send it
out singly. Girls will be hilled for
guest meals directly from the ac
counting office, or the house mother
can collect the money and turn it
in to the accounting office. Since it
is disturbing to the houses to have
guests in the middle of the week,
Miss Yost suggested that guests be
allowed only on week-ends. It will
be impossible to have "holes" in the
Row houses because of the difficulty
in getting supplies.
Girls who wish may move at the
end of this quarter. There will be
preference lists and room drawings
at that time.
Social Program Later
A program for acquainting the
freshman girls with the upper
classmen and the various living
groups on campus will be started
winter quarter under the direction
of Housing Committee. The pro
gram will consist of informal social
affairs at all the living groups and
an education program so that fresh
men may learn the differences .in
the various types of living groups.
