# Try outs for Gaieties End
## 
### 
There's something very sentimen
tal about the Farm's first peacetime
Gaieties, and even though the theme
won't be football this year, veterans
in civies and AST's in khaki and
NRO's in blue are so enthusiastic
that they far exceeded the turnout
of girls in the first two nights of
tryouts.
That sentimentality inspired a
tear in the eye as man after man
and man after woman treked to the
stage and presented their number,
whether dance, skit, song, or Sum
atra Hubba-hubba.
The last tryouts will be held to
night from 7 to 10 p.m. in the Me
morial Auditorium. Students un
able to come are invited to make
an appointment to be interviewed
personally, with Mary Lou Patton,
director of the Ram's Head produc
tion.
Spanish dancers are still particu
larly needed. Places are open for
specialty numbers such as original
songs, music, skits, song and dancc
teams, readings and pialologues.
Students are also needed for acting
parts, men's and women's choruses
and dances, and instrumental work
including orchestra numbers.
Help for technical, stage and
make-up crews arc still needed.
Both actors and technical crew
members will receive points toward
membership in Ram's Head, the
honorary dramatic society. Crew
members will receive more points,
however, than those acting.
The theme, "A Girl in Every
Port," will feature completely or
iginal music, dancing, and skits.
The Navy will have an opportunity
to act themselves in the musical
based around naval experiences in
various ports hither and yon.
