In a move designed to bring closer
student co-operation and under
standing of mutual problems be
tween Stanford and the University
of California, Cal has invited rep
resentatives from Stanford to conic
to the Berkeley campus this week
end for discussion of such prob
lems
In connection with the coming
lakls, Kennedy said. "1 think this
is a fine opportunity for inter
change of student ideas, and I

expect the idea to spread to all
western colleges and universities."
Kennedy added that Stanford may
play host to a similar conference
sometime next spring, but that plans
for this are as yet unformulated
and the project itself is still only
tentative.
The students who will represent
(he Farm during the two-day con
ference arc: Bob Kennedy, ASSU
president; Cliarmian Kolar, ASSU
vice-president: B. J. Calfce, stu
dent manager; Sylvia Davis,
Women's Council chairman; Patty
Patten, chairman of Women's
Conference; Joan McDonough,
Cardinals head; Crane Honeysett,
Excom; Helen Diet/-. Daily editor;
Ric Supple; Stanley Wilson; and
Ed Luce.
The Stanford delegation will meet
ten Cal representatives for a round
table discussion of topics of mutual
interest to both campuses. The con
ference will start at 7:30 Friday eve
ning and will continue till about 10.
Delegates from both campuses will
re-convene Saturday morning at 9:-
30 for further discussion. After
lunch, the Stanford delegation has
been invited to attend the Washing
ton-Cal football game in the Cal
stadium.
Planned by the ASUC Committee
on Inter-Campus Conferences under
the leadership of Bob Reidelberger,
the discussions were proposed to
take the place of the Pacific Stu
dent President Association whose

functions were severely handicapped
during the war due to transporta
tion difficulties, according to Ken
nedy.
In his letter to Kennedy, Reidel
berger extended an invitation to the
entire Stanford student body to at
tend the discussions. Talk on each
of the four topics will be introduced
by moderators, after which student
delegates will present their views.
Further discussion from the as
sembly at large will be heard, to be
presided over by the moderator.
