## 
### 
According to word received by
the Ninth Service Command at Ft.
Douglas from the Adjutant General
in Washington, Stanford's ASTAP
unit will be dissolved on Dec. 1. No
official announcement has made con
cerning the termination date of the
ASTRP.
The ASTAP men of Cycle 111
will be separated on Dcc. 1, while
Cycle 1 trainees will remain in
the program throughout the term
which begins next Monday and
concludes on Dec. 2!).
At Stanford where the ASTAP
trainees are all in Cycle 111, this an
nouncement indicates that all Engi
neering students are receiving the
opportunity to finish work of the
eight weeks remaining in the term.
Since the men are being separated
at the convenience of the govern
ment without having completed a
course, they will be separated as
special graduates.
The ASTP unit, a fixture on the
Farm ever since the War Depart
ment inaugurated their college
training program, has been the sub
ject of countless rumors as to its
future ever since V-J Day. A week
after V-J the War Department had
announced that the program would
continue as before. Approximately
fifty new trainees arrived for the
new term that began on Sept. 9.
No official announcement was
made as to what branch of the
Army the men will he sent. The
commandant is of the opinion
that since the separation is being
effected by the Adjutant General,
the particular assignments are
likely to be more in accord with
the individual preferences than
those assignments of trainees be
ing separated before (he conclu
sion of a term. This assumes that
the Adjutant General determines
the assignments on the basis of
the value of the college training
to the service.
