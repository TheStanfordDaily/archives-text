LONDON, Oct. 3 (UP). —Soviet Foreign Commissar Viache
slav Molotov was en route to Moscow tonight with a last-minute
compromise proposal from the United States on Balkan peace
treaty framing, stumbling block of the foreign ministers' coun
cil. London observers believed the next move toward world
peace must be made by the Big Three.
Reports mainly from reliable British sources, said that Gener
alissimo Josef Stalin, basing his attitude upon his understanding
of Potsdam Big Three agreements, already had taken a stand
against requests from President Truman and Prime Minister
Clement Attlee to change Soviet policy.
U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes revealed at a press
conference that he had proposed a compromise plan of settle
ment for the Balkan treaties by which only the Big Three na
tions would join in considering the drafts, if the Soviet Union
was willing to submit them later to the other Allied Nations.
The foreign ministers had ended their conference with little
report to the world of any definite accomplishment. It was in
creasingly apparent that the Big Three heads of state might have
to meet and agree on procedure before the world peace machinry
could get moving again.
