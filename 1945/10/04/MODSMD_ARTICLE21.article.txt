# ASSEMBLY AT 10!
## First Peacetime Assembly To Introduce Stalnaker 
### 
Stanford's student body, 3,700
strong, will assemble today at 10 a.
m. in Memorial Auditorium for the
first peacetime assembly in four
years and the first conducted by
newly elected Bob Kennedy.
The last peacetime meeting held
on the Farm was the Big Game ral
ly on November 27, 1941. The next
time the student body met the skies
had darkened and the blackness of
war had broken over Stanford. It
was December 10, 1941 and Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur told the
students, "This is reality. We're
right up against the guns. And
when we're up against the guns, we
act accordingly."
The .student body was faced with
the difficult task of conversion to
war. Student body president George
Jackson and his successors, Ed
Stamm and Janet McClanahan, suc
cessfully completed this job. Now
President Kennedy is faced with the
difficult task of reconversion.
It is because of this task of re
conversion that President Kennedy
has asked that members of ex
com be introduced to the student
body today. "This is the Excom
that will have to bring about the
reconversion and I feel that the
student bodv should have a chance
to meet its law-making body and
see the people who arc leading the
student government," Kennedy
said.
Changes have occured on the Farm
since that December day. The fac
ulty has recorded at least two major
changes. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder,
who will deliver the major address
today, succeeded Ray Lyman Wilbur
as Stanford president and John M.
Stalnaker, who is to be introduced
to tne students at the assembly to
day, was appointed to fill the new
position of Dean of Students.
Sports which occupied such a
bright spot in that last student
body rally were forced to discon
tinue the next year. But now
with reconversion to peacetime in
full swing, Stanford has announced
a return to athletics this winter.
Newt Arnold, newly elected cheer
leader, will lead the students in
famous Stanford yells and songs
in lieu of athletic events this
fall.
"Come Join the Band," the fa
miliar strains of which arc known
to Stanford fans all over the nation,
"Sons of the Stanford Red," Indian
fight song, "The Cardinal is Wav
ing," Stanford victory march, the
beautiful "Stanford Hymn" will be
sung by the students.

The assembly will l>e unique in
that it is the first time that mem
bers Â»112 Excom have ever been
introduced to the student body at
this lirst assembly. Members of
Excoin that will be introduced
from the stage are Lorraine
Streblow, Betty Wellington, Bill
Borthwick, Shirley Sncath, Frank
DeLisle, Jeanne Wallace, and
Gloria Anderson.
The nature of President Tresid
der's talk has not been announced
but it is understood that Dean Stal
naker will not deliver a formal ad
dress.

navy and army units will be dis
