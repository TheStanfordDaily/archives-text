two or three week practice period
and will be chosen by their interest
and their work hours put in. They
will also be required to pass a small

More photographers and office
workers are still needed and per
sons who missed the first meeting
come into the Quad office any
afternoon Monday through Friday

said.
The dummy for the 1946 Quad has
already been laid out by Art Editor
Sabra Kransfelder. Organization
pictures will be scheduled soon.
