STANFORD "VICTORY DAY"
Seems like a long time ago now, but we can
still remember that wildly joyful Tuesday, Au
gust 14, 1945, when the radio poured out news
of final Japanese capitulation and we thought
about Stanford and how good it would have
been to participate in an all-campus V-J Day.
We lead later about the Victory Dance that Tues
day night and the special thanksgiving service
in the Memorial Church the next morning, but
we were always a little sorry that, after seeing
Stanford in war, we weren't among Summer
Quarter students on hand to welcome the peace
to the University. That's why today's first
post-war assembly will be our "Stanford Victory
Day." Even more than that we hope that today,
when the new area representative Excom and
the new Dean of Students are introduced, when
Dr. Tresidder speaks, and when 3,700 students
sing Stanford songs, chant Stanford yells —
when we witness all that we hope we will be
seeing in immediate outline a strong, practical,
progressive, and far-sighted post-war Stanford.
