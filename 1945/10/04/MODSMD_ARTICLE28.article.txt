# Bull Session
## 
### Stanley Wilson 
The first time I noticed him was when he
slumped to the floor with a groan. His face
was pale, his eyes were sunken and he showed
all signs of one who has been without proper
nourishment for weeks on end.
Cautiously I approached the spot where he
lay. By this time a considerable crowd had
gathered and were looking at him in the same
manner as I. It was incredible. A few untact
ful persons merely stepped over his prostrate
form and hurried on their way. I guess I'm a
humanitarian. Anyhow, I examined him from
a distance. There were no signs of violence.
Finally 112 asked one of the group what ill dis
ease or accident had befallen him. "Stupid, can t
you keep quiet and try and help us?" he re
plied. "I'm sorry," I said.
Still in a guandary, I helped the fellow to
his fcei and we started to work on him. He
looked as though he might come around
after all. But he was awfully weak.
This procedure of falling down in a faint, only
to be pulled up by me, or one of his buddies,
continued for some time. We kept trying to pro
cure something to relieve him, but no one
seemed to care much. Everyone was so im
personal. And the people who would step over
him, little caring what had happened to him,
hurt me most of all. Apparently the fellow had
been there for some time, because one of his
friends kept saying, "If only he hadn't come
here so early." "But he insisted he had to,"
said another. I was still in a quandary.
The poor degenerate fellow would move a
few feet and then collapse again. And every
one was so impersonal. I refused to step over
him. But 1 was becoming weary of hoisting
him to his feet only to have him fall again.
It was monotonous.
And now I was beginning to get the feeling
the fellow I'm describing had. First I was hot,
then I was cold. Then I started to get weak.
I looked around for someone to help me, but as
I said, everyone was so impersonal. No one
seemed to care.
It was hard enough for me to stand up, let
alone try and keep someone else on his feet.
We attempted to hold each other up. First I
leaned on him and then he would lean on me.
We progressed a little farther, and were al
most to our goal, when he fell again. 1 knew
this time he would never get up again. And
besides, how could I help him in my condi
tion?
I became cold and cynical, just like the rest

of the people there. I became impersonal. I
failed to care any more. In what was my last
possible effort I struggled over him much like
the others had done.
/ know it wasn't the right thing to do. It
was heartless. It was impersonal. But 1 didn't
care. 1 couldn't lose my place in line. I had
to have my Cellar coftee.

I became cold and cynical, just like the rest

of the people there. I became impersonal. I
failed to care any more. In what was my last
possible effort I struggled over him much like
the others had done.
/ know it wasn't the right thing to do. It
was heartless. It was impersonal. But 1 didn't
care. 1 couldn't lose my place in line. I had
to have my Cellar coftee.
The first time I noticed him was when he
slumped to the floor with a groan. His face
was pale, his eyes were sunken and he showed
all signs of one who has been without proper
nourishment for weeks on end.
Cautiously I approached the spot where he
lay. By this time a considerable crowd had
gathered and were looking at him in the same
manner as I. It was incredible. A few untact
ful persons merely stepped over his prostrate
form and hurried on their way. I guess I'm a
humanitarian. Anyhow, I examined him from
a distance. There were no signs of violence.
Finally 112 asked one of the group what ill dis
ease or accident had befallen him. "Stupid, can t
you keep quiet and try and help us?" he re
plied. "I'm sorry," I said.
Still in a guandary, I helped the fellow to
his fcei and we started to work on him. He
looked as though he might come around
after all. But he was awfully weak.
This procedure of falling down in a faint, only
to be pulled up by me, or one of his buddies,
continued for some time. We kept trying to pro
cure something to relieve him, but no one
seemed to care much. Everyone was so im
personal. And the people who would step over
him, little caring what had happened to him,
hurt me most of all. Apparently the fellow had
been there for some time, because one of his
friends kept saying, "If only he hadn't come
here so early." "But he insisted he had to,"
said another. I was still in a quandary.
The poor degenerate fellow would move a
few feet and then collapse again. And every
one was so impersonal. I refused to step over
him. But 1 was becoming weary of hoisting
him to his feet only to have him fall again.
It was monotonous.
And now I was beginning to get the feeling
the fellow I'm describing had. First I was hot,
then I was cold. Then I started to get weak.
I looked around for someone to help me, but as
I said, everyone was so impersonal. No one
seemed to care.
It was hard enough for me to stand up, let
alone try and keep someone else on his feet.
We attempted to hold each other up. First I
leaned on him and then he would lean on me.
We progressed a little farther, and were al
most to our goal, when he fell again. 1 knew
this time he would never get up again. And
besides, how could I help him in my condi
tion?
