# Truman Steps Into Strikes

### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 3 (UP). â€”The government moved to end the
nationwide oil strike tonight by ordering struck refineries and
plants seized as tension mounted in the automotive industry fol
lowing blunt refusal by the General Motors Corporation to accede
to a union pay demand. .
The White House announced that President Truman, acting to
halt the spread of strikes by the Oil Workers' International Union,
would take over all strikebound oil installations tomorrow.
Mr. Truman's action came a few hours after a conciliation con
ference, designed to find a solution to the bitter union-manage
ment clash in the petroleum industry, had failed.
The seizure order, which a White House spokesman said was
being drafted, came amidst a serious labor situation. Strikes either
were breaking out in or threatening the nation's vital coal, auto
motive, shipping and communications industries.
