# HISTORY -1945

### 
The London Foreign Ministers' conference
has broken up with everybody agreeing to dis
agree. The British and French blame the Rus
sians, the Americans talk about differences of
opinion that weren't realized before, and the
Soviets are falling back into an attitude that can
best be described as a bombastic aloofness.
The crux of the argument was the Balkans.
The issue over excluding France and China
from the negotiations in regard to them, which
was credited with finally breaking things up,
was nevertheless probably secondary.
BASIS OF ISSUE
But then comes the question, what brought
the issue about? First of all, it might be Rus
sian expansion, or, more accurately, a sounding
board of how far the democracies will go in
case Russia does try to expand herself.
Secondly, it might be a genuine misunder
standing of terms. The Soviets have only made
consistent demands here. They have worked
out a policy of conciliation in China, and have
kept out of Scandanavian affairs.
The latter is particularly important. The
China deal might be thought of as securing
the Soviet in the East while she progressed
in the West, and we don't know if there were
any secret articles in the seemingly fair treaty
worked out by Stalin and T. V. Soong that
might serve as jokers.
But, if Russia was intending to push ahead in
Europe, she would certainly try to expand to the
north as well as to the south. In Finland, she
did increase her influence, but the old govern
ment stands pretty much as it did before the
war. There is nothing like the pressure tactics
evident in the Balkans.
It is true that the Communist party has been
active in Sweden, and that it got an unexpected
windfall in the last general election. But then
it stupidly tried to push its power by calling a
general strike in certain basic industries; the
only thing this accomplished was to ruin the
party treasury. The fine hand of Moscow cer
tainly had no part in directing that!
DISAGREEMENT
Then what the basis of everything must be
is that Russia was promised a free hand in the
Balkans, and interprets this to mean that Balkan
Communists must take over. The reactionary
feudal regimes of too many of the other parties,
Moscow probably reasons, would invalidate
any other arrangement before it was drafted.
But America and Britain stand for general
elections. Russia wants her own people, and
thus the seeds of crises are sown.
Russia killed the conference, so the next
move is up to her. First of all, she might, and
probably will, postpone elections in the Bal
kans and wait for the western powers to open
negotiations again.
Failing that, she will go to the next meeting
of Foreign Ministers and again uphold her
claims. And, if that falls apart, then she just
might try to test us. Of course, she could fire
Molotov ahd settle everything to our advantage
in a Big Three meeting, but that doesn't seem to
be the way she works these things.
Her move might be to let things drift, which
she can do, but wouldn't settle anything, or to
risk starting revolutions in the Balkans on the
hope of putting a set of facts accomplished
before the world. This might settle everything
for the present, but even if Stalin could wrest
out a Munich, he would be faced with a schism
in Europe that might be irreparable. On the
other hand, if he does not work for one, his
prestige is in danger, and that seems to count
for very much with him. What is going on is
thus a war or nerves. The result will have to be
compromise, unless the American delegation
gives in.
America doesn't seem in the mood to, how
ever, and so the peace is now marching into
existence on a thread.
