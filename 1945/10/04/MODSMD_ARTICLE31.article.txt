To The Editor:
Whose brows are wrinkled over losing (heir man?
And what is this singular sparkling "Oomph" that only
this year's young post-high school girls can offer?
This long, much exaggerated article in the Daily, Oct.
2 of the unusual qualities concerning this yoar's Roble
freshmen calls for a comment on (ho part of Stanford
wartime women students.
The article sounds as if all the Roble women in
desperation bribed, beat, or dragged the poor author
into writing the column to inform Stanford that "tht
freshmen have arrived. In the welcome of new stu
dents one should nol go to such lengths as to deprecate
the standards of previous women. When there was a
shortage of everything from name bands to men war
time women students kept Stanford going. It is ;igreed
that during the war standards were not up to par, but
let us not include the attributes of the enrolled women
students in that!
