In a hectic interview, which was
continually interrupted by phone
calls and visitors, Bob disclosed his
life history, adding a few original
quips every now and then.
Stanford's student president, an
ex-Marine, was born in Oakland
and graduated from Oakland High
School. After a year at Menlo
Junior College, he entered Stan

cers' training school at Quanlico,
Virginia. On October 15, 1942, he
left the United States for New Cale
donia and began a ten months'
training period in the First Marine
Raider Battalion. Bob was wounded
in August, 1943, on New Georgia
Island and was sent home via New
Zealand.
After spending several months
recuperating at the Naval Hospi
tal on Mare Island, he was dis
charged from the Marine Corps
as a first lieutenant. The Farm's
president entered the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
the summer quarter of H>44 only
to break his arm six weeks after
he had registered.
It took Bob seven weeks to re
cover from this accident, and, for
the second time, he re-entered
Stanford, in the fall quarter of 1944.
This time all went well, and last
spring quarter Bob Kennedy was
elected president of the A.S.S.U.
At this point in the interview, the
ex-Marine stopped talking about
his past and announced an impor
tant event which will occur in the
near future. In December, during
Stanford's Christmas vacation, Bob
will marry Renee Lindquist, a for
mer Stanford student and member
of Kappa Kappa Gamma. He will
graduate from the School ol Busi
ness in June, 1946. and hopes to go
into business in the Bay Area.
When questioned about the
Farm's future and its first post
war year, the president said that
"it looks like a great year and
Stanford will be able to reconvert
along with business."
Bob is now living with "two grand
people," Stanford's Emeritus Dean
of Men and his wife, Dean and Mrs.
George B. Culver.
At (he conclusion of the inter
view, as the Daily reporter left the
president's office, the phone began
to ring and Bob Kennedy, ex-Ma
rine Corps lieutenant, present leader
of the Stanford student body, again
became the efficient executive.

In a hectic interview, which was
continually interrupted by phone
calls and visitors, Bob disclosed his
life history, adding a few original
quips every now and then.

ex-Marine, was born in Oakland

training period in the First Marine
Raider Battalion. Bob was wounded
in August, 1943, on New Georgia
Island and was sent home via New
Zealand.
After spending several months
recuperating at the Naval Hospi

charged from the Marine Corps
as a first lieutenant. The Farm's
president entered the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
the summer quarter of H>44 only
to break his arm six weeks after
he had registered.
It took Bob seven weeks to re
cover from this accident, and, for
the second time, he re-entered
Stanford, in the fall quarter of 1944.
This time all went well, and last
spring quarter Bob Kennedy was
elected president of the A.S.S.U.
At this point in the interview, the
ex-Marine stopped talking about
his past and announced an impor
tant event which will occur in the
near future. In December, during
Stanford's Christmas vacation, Bob
will marry Renee Lindquist, a for
mer Stanford student and member
of Kappa Kappa Gamma. He will
graduate from the School ol Busi
ness in June, 1946. and hopes to go
into business in the Bay Area.
When questioned about the
