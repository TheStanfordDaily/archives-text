# ‘Manager B.J. Calfee Guards A.S.S.U. Fund

### PAT MOONEY 
Biography of a trouble-shooter—the title bears a
very close resemblance to the life of B. J. Calfee in
her present office of student manager. Miss Calfee
has charge of all the funds of organizations on campus,
with the exception of living groups, and has to pass

on all money spent, help distraught
treasurers procure enough money
for dances and parties, and gener
ally play the role of a Dutch uncle
and financially minded understand
ing grandmother to prevent groups
from overdrawing their treasuries.
It is up to her whether the Daily
gets new typewriters or the Dra
matic Council a new motor curtain.
Miss Calfee lias a good recom
mendation for efficiency by the
offices she has held previously—
member of Sophomore Excom,
chairman of the Soph Cotillion
of '4(>, senior class president and
a sponsor at Itoble for two quar
ters.
An education major, Miss Calfee
said she has ambitions that her
friends would undoubtedly laugh at
—going to China and the Far East
and helping in the education and
rehabilitation program. This she
claimed as more of an idle dream,
however, and said she would prob
ably be a teacher of social studies
or physical education, both her mi
nors.
She was very enthusiastic about
prospects for the return of "big
name" bands and similar signs of
Stanford's return to the pre-war
schedule. She said that her first
impression of Stanford was that
everything good was right here,
and even working as a trouhle
| shooter has not changed her ideas
a great deal. She mentioned the
spirit of democracy that prevailed
i all over campus, that you could
never tell whether your next
door neighbor was a millionaire
. •
or was rubbing his last two nick
! els together. Friends and ac
quaintances are judged by their
own personalities instead of by
! how much they can buy.
She also commented on the spirit
; of the Stanford Family, saying that
' it really was true that Stanford
! students get together and can be
j recognized even when they are
! away from school. It may have been
said many times before but it is still
very true that we are closer and
more united than any other student
body, she continued.
Post-war prospects for the Farm
appear very good, Miss Calfee
| stated, now that the war-time re-
I strictions are very largely oil - the
! financial offices.
