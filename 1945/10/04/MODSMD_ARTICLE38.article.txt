# Historian's Talk Today
## 
### 
"The New American History" will
be discussed by Edgar E. Robinson,
Margaret Byrne Professor of Ameri
can History and head of the X)e
partmenl of History, for the open
ing meeting of the American Studies
Symposium this afternoon. His talk
will begin at 4:15 p.m. in the lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. Robinson received the A.B.
and A.M. at Wisconsin. He came to
Stanford in 1911 as an associate
professor of history and has watched
the growth in size and scope of the
department to include niany re
gional studies.
History Institute
Since 1942 when it was first or
ganized Dr. Robinson has been in
terested in the Stanford Institute of
American History, a series of con
ferences of Western colleges and
universities. The Institute has held
six meetings at which information
on research and methods has been
exchanged. When transportation
and accommodations improve, he
said; it is expected that a Pacific
Coast conference will be held here.
One of Dr. Robinson's particular
interests is the study of presiden
tial elections, on which he has pub
lished a series of volumes entitled
"The Presidential Vote." But he
feels that the study of the lives and
leaders of American political par
ties is more interesting to him. Con
cerning this subject ne has pub
lished "The Evolution of American
Political Parties." He has also writ
ten "The Foreign Policy of Wood
row Wilson."
Commenting on the purpose of
his lecture for the Humanities-spon
sored symposium today, Dr. Robin
son explained that every passing
year increases the subject matter
of history. Thus, history is always
new because of constantly appear
ing points of view, discoveries, and
objectives of mankind.
"The record looks different to
each succeeding generation," he
said. "Thirty-five years ago there
was much writing by American his
torians, notably James Harvey Rob
inson, Charles Beard, Frederick
Jackson Turner, on what they
termed 'the new history.' The world
they saw is now gone. It is time for
a restatement of the new American
history."
ilistory Changes
Dr. Robinson considers the most
significant changes since those days
to be the increase in detailed sub
ject matter, the greater emphasis on
the last half-century, and the wide
dispersion of Americans and Ameri
can interests throughout the world.

Finally is the insistence on the story
of man's attempt to govern himself
as the all-important theme in the
new history.
