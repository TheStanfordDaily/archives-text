# ‘Lassie’ Sequel Failure—--Bower
## 
### 
SON OF LASSIE—Ends tonight at
the Varsity Theater
"Son of Lassie" is one of those
Technicolor feasts that seeks to
overpower you with pine trees, tow
ering mountains, and running rap
ids. If you're an especially sensual
person, 1 imagine that you'll fall for
this Hollywood narcotic. Otherwise,
you'll probably wonder how M-G-M

had the nerve to
present such an
incredibly cheap
story.
"Son of Las
sie" is an un
usual story in
that it tries to
combine a dog
story and a war
yarn at the same
time. Laddie, son
of Lassie, is a

dog in case you didn't know. Now
this dog is extremely talented and
his master enrolls him in a war
time dog training corps. But when
the master (Peter Lawford) is draft
ed the dog runs after him. Anyway,
they both end up in Norway amid
Grieg's Concerto and other appro
priate musical selections.
Trite, Trite, Trite;
It's not long befoe the Nazis cap
ture the robust pair, following
which the eventual escape from the
enemies' clutches occurs. Finally
after running up and down several
mountains, traipsing through a few
bars, and wading around in a num
be of swirling rapids, everything is
restored to normalcy and the heroic
pair leave Norway to the melodic
strains of "Red Sails in the Sunset."
It's not long before "The End" is
flashed upon the screen and you
know the picture's over.
The all-animal cast also includes
the venerable Donald Crisp in an
other of his curt, gruff roles. But
don't expect much acting in "Son of
Lassie." About all you'll see are

lots of flowers, bees, and an occa
sional "bird."
Oh Goody—Tar/an
The second feature also is of the
back-to-nature variety. Only this
time as far back as we get are the
North Hollywood hills. The picture
stars Johnny Weissmuller and, you
guessed it, is another Tarzan ve
hicle, bearing the title "Tarzan and
the Amazons." There's all sorts of
fake scenery around, everything
from a potted palm to a pink ele
phant, the latter being seen by only
a few fortunate members of the
audience.—Dick Bower

ed the dog runs after him. Anyway,
they both end up in Norway amid
Grieg's Concerto and other appro
priate musical selections.
Trite, Trite, Trite;
It's not long befoe the Nazis cap
ture the robust pair, following
which the eventual escape from the
enemies' clutches occurs. Finally
after running up and down several
mountains, traipsing through a few
bars, and wading around in a num
be of swirling rapids, everything is
restored to normalcy and the heroic
pair leave Norway to the melodic
strains of "Red Sails in the Sunset."
It's not long before "The End" is
flashed upon the screen and you
know the picture's over.
The all-animal cast also includes
the venerable Donald Crisp in an
other of his curt, gruff roles. But
don't expect much acting in "Son of
Lassie." About all you'll see are

lots of flowers, bees, and an occa
sional "bird."
Oh Goody—Tar/an
The second feature also is of the
back-to-nature variety. Only this
time as far back as we get are the
North Hollywood hills. The picture
stars Johnny Weissmuller and, you
guessed it, is another Tarzan ve
hicle, bearing the title "Tarzan and
the Amazons." There's all sorts of
fake scenery around, everything
from a potted palm to a pink ele
phant, the latter being seen by only
a few fortunate members of the
audience.—Dick Bower

SON OF LASSIE—Ends tonight at
the Varsity Theater
"Son of Lassie" is one of those
Technicolor feasts that seeks to
overpower you with pine trees, tow
ering mountains, and running rap
ids. If you're an especially sensual
person, 1 imagine that you'll fall for
this Hollywood narcotic. Otherwise,
you'll probably wonder how M-G-M

had the nerve to
present such an
incredibly cheap
story.
"Son of Las
sie" is an un
usual story in
that it tries to
combine a dog
story and a war
yarn at the same
time. Laddie, son
of Lassie, is a

dog in case you didn't know. Now
this dog is extremely talented and
his master enrolls him in a war
time dog training corps. But when
the master (Peter Lawford) is draft
ed the dog runs after him. Anyway,
they both end up in Norway amid
Grieg's Concerto and other appro
priate musical selections.
