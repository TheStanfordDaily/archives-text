LONDON, Oct. 3 (UP). —Soviet Russia has demanded that Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur be replaced immediately as the governing
power of Japan by an Allied Control Council of the four major
Pacific powers, radio Moscow disclosed today.
The Soviets prefaced their demand for an equal voice in the
administration of Japan with the assertion that Mac Arthur's posi
tion as supreme Allied commander has been outmoded by the
successful disarmament of Japanese military forces.
The demand was contained in a letter from Soviet Foreign
Commissar V. M. Molotov to U.S. Secretary of State James F.
Eyrnes, which was broadcast by Moscow.
The letter objected to Byrnes' announcement that Russia had
agreed to an Anglo-American proposal that the Pacific powers,
including France, should set up an advisory commission to ex
plore the necessity of establishing a control council for Japan.
