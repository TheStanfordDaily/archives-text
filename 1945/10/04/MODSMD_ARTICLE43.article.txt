DETROIT, Oct. 3 (UP). —The Chicago Cubs, treating Hal Newliouser,
the major leagues' leading pitcher this year, like a cousin, batted the De
troit Tigers all over Briggs Stadium today to win the first game of the
1945 World Series, 9 to 0, behind the six-hit pitching of Fordham Hank
Borowy. Starting out with a bang, the Cubs got to Newhouser, who won

25 games in Detroit's path to the
American League pennant, for four
runs in the rst inning, knocked him
out in the third when they scored
three more times and added two
more runs for good measure off one
of the three other hurlers called on
by Manager Steve O'Neill in a vain
attempt to still the thundering Chi
cago bats.
In trouble in almost every inning
because of his wildness and the six
scattered hits which the Tigers got
off his sharp-breaking curve ball,
Borowy bore down when Detroit
had men on the bases and that extra
pressure pulled him out of several
tight spots.
Riding behind that early lead, he
toyed with the Tigers and then
when it looked like Detroit might
rally, he closed the door. He pitched
only as good as he had to pitch, and '
it was much too good for the Amer- |
ican League champions today.
