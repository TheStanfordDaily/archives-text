# Stars Return Will Continue Baseball Boom
## 
### STU MILLAR 
With this year's baseball compe
tition now entered in the annals of
history, it is time to decide the true
worth of many of the horsehiders
who have been inhabiting the ma
jor leagues during the past four or
ave years.
Many of them have proved to be
of definite major league peace-time
ability. Others have looked good,
but will probably not last in compe
tition with Beasleys, Pollets, Di-
Maggios, et al, who will shortly be
returning from the service.
Oldsters To Fade
Some of the old-timers who have
had a rebirth because of the dearth
of top stars will once again be fad
ing into obscurity. Fuzzy-cheeked
youngsters quickly advanced to fill
the voids will be sent down to
leagues of lower class to season
themselves more fully.
On the other hand, some of the
top stars of yesteryear will, much
to then surprise, find themselves un
der the shelter of the cool dugout
when the starting pitchers stroll out
to the mounds. Managers like
Marse Joe McCarthy of the N.Y.
Yankees will be forced to cut some
one when men like Phil Rizzuto,
Joe Gordon, Snuffy Stirnweiss, Billy
Johnson, Nick Etten and Buddy
Hassett will be fighting it out for
starting infield births.
Shapman Hard-Up
But such will not be the fortu
nate lot of all big-league mentors.
Ben Chapman, now head of the
Philadelphia Ph Is, perennial inhabi
tants of the National league cellar,
is not likely to be whooping with
joy when spring training rolls
around again in March.
Break Attendance Marks
Even though the competition this
year was often compared to good
double A ball and even though there
was a lack of big name attractions
to lure Joe Fan through the turn
stiles, attendance records at major
league ball gardens soared to new
and previously fantastic heights.
For example, never before have the
three N.Y. teams, Brooklyn, the
Giants and the Yanks dreamed of
each drawing one million paying
customers in the same season. Yet
this year the three million mark
was surpassed in rather comfortable
fashion.
The obvious conclusion to be
drawn is that the United States is
becoming more sports-minded than
ever. If this is true, what have the
major leagues, and other circuits
too. to expect when the big names
are once again dotting the line-ups.

On the other hand, some of the
top stars of yesteryear will, much
to then surprise, find themselves un
der the shelter of the cool dugout
when the starting pitchers stroll out
to the mounds. Managers like
Marse Joe McCarthy of the N.Y.
Yankees will be forced to cut some
one when men like Phil Rizzuto,
Joe Gordon, Snuffy Stirnweiss, Billy
Johnson, Nick Etten and Buddy
Hassett will be fighting it out for
starting infield births.
Shapman Hard-Up
But such will not be the fortu
nate lot of all big-league mentors.
Ben Chapman, now head of the
Philadelphia Ph Is, perennial inhabi
tants of the National league cellar,
is not likely to be whooping with
joy when spring training rolls
around again in March.
Break Attendance Marks
Even though the competition this
year was often compared to good
double A ball and even though there
was a lack of big name attractions
to lure Joe Fan through the turn
stiles, attendance records at major
league ball gardens soared to new
and previously fantastic heights.
For example, never before have the
three N.Y. teams, Brooklyn, the
Giants and the Yanks dreamed of
each drawing one million paying
customers in the same season. Yet
this year the three million mark
was surpassed in rather comfortable
fashion.
The obvious conclusion to be
drawn is that the United States is
becoming more sports-minded than
ever. If this is true, what have the
major leagues, and other circuits
too. to expect when the big names
are once again dotting the line-ups.
With this year's baseball compe
tition now entered in the annals of
history, it is time to decide the true
worth of many of the horsehiders
who have been inhabiting the ma
jor leagues during the past four or
ave years.
Many of them have proved to be
of definite major league peace-time
ability. Others have looked good,
but will probably not last in compe
tition with Beasleys, Pollets, Di-
Maggios, et al, who will shortly be
returning from the service.
Oldsters To Fade
Some of the old-timers who have
had a rebirth because of the dearth
of top stars will once again be fad
ing into obscurity. Fuzzy-cheeked
youngsters quickly advanced to fill
the voids will be sent down to
leagues of lower class to season
themselves more fully.
