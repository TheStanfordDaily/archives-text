### AL SCIARONI 
Another hay area team, the
Unhersity of San Francisco, lias
made known its intention to play
football next year, Jimmy Needles,
director of Athletics at U.S.F.,
announced yesterday that his
school has hired Clipper Smith,
ex-Notre Dame great, as head
football coach.
With the Dons coming back into
the fold it leaves Santa Clara as
the only club not back in the foot
ball picture for next season.
Smith Well Known Here
Clipper Smith is no new man to
this part of the country. He coached
at Santa Clara from 1928 to 1936
when he signed a contract with
Villanova. While coaching at Santa
Clara. Clipper made a fine record
for himself beating California three
consecutive times, and giving Stan
ford the short end of the score more
than once.
Smith started his coaching career
at Columbia University just outside
of Portland. From there he moved
to Gonzaga where he built up a
squad which was the equal of the
Coast Conference teams. It is said
he was signed by Santa Clara be
cause his Gonzaga team was able
to defeat St. Mary's. If this was the
dream of the padres down at Santa
Clara, it never came true. In Smith's
eight years there he wasn't able to,
defeat the men from Moraga once.
Game of the Week
It looks as though the St.
Mary's-Nevada contest will he the
game of the week here on the
Pacific Coast. Both clubs have
shown some fine talents, and have
defeated with ease some good
western teams.
Nevada brought itself into real
prominence last Saturday by defeat
ing the best team the University of
Utah has fielded in four seasons. St.
Mary's has done nothing less than
defeat the Golden Bears and the Sac
ramento Commandos.
With the addition of another
hackfield man with known talents
the Galloping Gaels will be better
off than before. The new addition
to the team is Ilarold Van Giesen
another boy from Ilonodulu. Van
Giesen played with Wedemeyer at
St. Mary's back in 1943.
Nevada has nothing to be ashamed
about in its potential All-American
Bob McClure. But with All-Ameri
cans or not we pick St. Mary's as
the winner this Saturday. In fact
we wouldn't at all be surprised if
they ended up as the top team on
the coast. No matter what you
think, if you want to see one af the
top games of the season, go to Kezar
this Sunday at 2:30.

cause his Gonzaga team was able
to defeat St. Mary's. If this was the
dream of the padres down at Santa
Clara, it never came true. In Smith's
eight years there he wasn't able to,
defeat the men from Moraga once.
Game of the Week
It looks as though the St.
Mary's-Nevada contest will he the
game of the week here on the
Pacific Coast. Both clubs have
shown some fine talents, and have
defeated with ease some good
western teams.
Nevada brought itself into real
prominence last Saturday by defeat
ing the best team the University of
Utah has fielded in four seasons. St.
Mary's has done nothing less than
defeat the Golden Bears and the Sac
ramento Commandos.
With the addition of another
hackfield man with known talents
the Galloping Gaels will be better
off than before. The new addition
to the team is Ilarold Van Giesen
another boy from Ilonodulu. Van
Giesen played with Wedemeyer at
St. Mary's back in 1943.
Nevada has nothing to be ashamed
about in its potential All-American
Bob McClure. But with All-Ameri
cans or not we pick St. Mary's as
the winner this Saturday. In fact
we wouldn't at all be surprised if
they ended up as the top team on
the coast. No matter what you
think, if you want to see one af the
top games of the season, go to Kezar
this Sunday at 2:30.
Another hay area team, the
Unhersity of San Francisco, lias
made known its intention to play
football next year, Jimmy Needles,
director of Athletics at U.S.F.,
announced yesterday that his
school has hired Clipper Smith,
ex-Notre Dame great, as head
football coach.
With the Dons coming back into
the fold it leaves Santa Clara as
the only club not back in the foot
ball picture for next season.
Smith Well Known Here
Clipper Smith is no new man to
this part of the country. He coached
at Santa Clara from 1928 to 1936
when he signed a contract with
Villanova. While coaching at Santa
Clara. Clipper made a fine record
for himself beating California three
consecutive times, and giving Stan
ford the short end of the score more
than once.
Smith started his coaching career
at Columbia University just outside
of Portland. From there he moved
to Gonzaga where he built up a
squad which was the equal of the
Coast Conference teams. It is said
he was signed by Santa Clara be
cause his Gonzaga team was able
to defeat St. Mary's. If this was the
dream of the padres down at Santa
Clara, it never came true. In Smith's
eight years there he wasn't able to,
