# Tall Tales from Toyon
## 
### 
A very handsome man (not neces
sarily an R.O. man) walked upon
the scene of a very exciting tennis
match.
"Whose game?" he said.
"I am," said the cute young, (and
evidently freshman) thing standing
nearby.
The character of the week—"For
getless Fosdick"—
He lights cigarettes with a foun
tain pen—
He uses the drawer of his study
desk for an ashtray—
He always starts to an 8:00 class
at 7:30 so in case he forgets where
he's going he'll have time to correct
himself —
He never leaves his room without
forgetting some part of his clothing
and always starts down the wrong
corridor-
He wears his dress jumper inside
out and then wonders why it feels
so peculiar—
He throws books in ten directions
when someone yells "muster"—
He gets out of bed at 11:00 p.m.,
goes waking everyone in his wing
of the dorm asking "What was that
last announcement at evening
muster?"—
After about a week of this he is
sitting at his desk writing a letter,
jumps up and says, "Is the Post
Office open?" "Yes," says his room
mate. Out the door he goes on the
double—back in a flash for his hat
—goes to the end of the corridor,
comes rushing back in the room,
grabs the letter and as he takes off
at his usual speed of flying low
says, "I'm a little bit absentminded
at iimes."
Just a few words on the blind
date situation:
"Ah spect it'ud be a heap better
if'n these hyar feminan-nine resid
ings 'ud git together on this 'ere
blind date business. It's mighty fine
business, but you know there's 186
salts aboard this tug and there was
ony 250 gals wanted to datem last
weekend. That's an insult. Ye
hadn't oughta never ask'em to go
out with less'en three apiece. It
takes two a'workin steady to keep
the seadust off'en his uniform."
Seriously though, I'm sure the
efforts of the Sponsors of both the
guys and the gals were sincerely
appreciated for we have been a little
worried that some of our bell-bot
tomed papooses were not keeping
up our good old Navy traditions—
looks like Stanford U. is taking care
of them for us. Bravo! Girlies!
Bravo!
