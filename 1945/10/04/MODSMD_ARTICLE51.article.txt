### STAN DON 
Tomorrow night one of Uncle
Sam's gifts to Stanford—the ASTP—
will throw their first brawl of the
quarter in the Pavilion. Fresh from
their slide rules and gig slips, the
inmates of Encinasylum will be on
hand to dance away their worries to
rhythms of Walt Fleher's "Dance
Without a Band" records. The band
will be unable to play this Friday,
since the clarinet player's thumb
has been stuck in a beer bottle since
V-J Day. Walt maintains he is
saving the band for a brilliant debut
in the near future. It will be the
greatest thing to hit the
since Joey C. Heidelberg's home
run with four men on base.
Incidentally Joey H. says any girl
ought to be able to find her way to
the Pavilion without getting lost In
the cactus gardens. Later on in the
bull session Joey reminded us of
the campus tradition of coming stag.
Especially invited are the coeds,
Roughs, coeds, NROTC's, coeds.
AST's, and especially the coeds.
Any girl desiring to dance with
Dream-boat Heidelberg may make
advance reservations by calling En
cina at least twenty-four hours in
advance. In order to give all the
Stanford women a break, he will
only be able to dance four bars with
each one.
Observation: The Palo Alto the
aters, taking notice of the contro
versy waged on the editorial page
of the summer Dippy over the play
ing of the Star Spangled Banner,
have ceased showing it. Now coup
les won't have to break clinches to
stand up. Is everybody happy?
