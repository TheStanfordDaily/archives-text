# MEN MUST HELP
## 
### 
With adequate garden and janitor
service still at a premium, the Uni
versity is asking that men housed on
the row assist in keeping up the
lawns and yards, assist in laundry
service, clean windows, and keep the
dormitories tidy.
Those who help are paid at the
rate of 60 cents an hour. Men
should report hours worked to their
house manager or resident assistant.
