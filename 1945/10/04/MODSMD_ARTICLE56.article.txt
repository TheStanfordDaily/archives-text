# Drama, Publications Powers Explained

(Another in a series of articles
on student government under the
trial-constitution now in use. This
; is how student drama and pub
lications arc governed.)
Administrative board is the status
of such vital student groups as the
women's conference publication,
dramatic, debate, and music coun
| cils under the new constitution.
The groups are given more abso
! lute power in their particular fields
i on the theory that they are in the
best position to know the facts per
j taining to their more or less spe
| cialized fields.
i ' Real Power" to Board
Publications council, .for instance,
I previously could only recommend
to the executive committee of the
A.S.S.U. that certain measures be
adopted in respect to the Chaparral
or Daily. Under the new consti
tution it may make rules which are
binding unless vetoed by the
j A.S.S.U. president and a majority
I of the members, or two-thirds of
! the members alone.
This clearer delegation of real
power to the board is intended to
: put weight upon the decisions of
! the board created to handle special
j fields and to reduce the difficulty
of acquainting the general commit
tee with the circumstances of each
recommendation.
Finance Controls
The largest campus organizations
with finances, such as Ram's Head
and The Stanford Quad, are gov
erned through these boards. Mem
bers are officers of the organizations
and a faculty adviser with a vote.
Appeal from decisions can be easily
I made by appearing before the
j executive committee and seeking to
I have minutes of the board meet-
I ing vetoed.
Under the new constitution all
I such boards and organizations must
' revise their charters to conform to
| the constitution. This aims to in
j corporate many overlapping char
! ters and by-laws into a more co

herent scheme of legislation. It in
volves only minor changes in most
cases, as for instance, the Daily by
laws xequire no change.
Conference a Law-Maker
Women's conference however
must bring its rules up to date. It
is changed from a legislative body,
able to amend its own legislation,
to a body with rule-making power
able to make rules concerning
women exclusively that are con
sistent with legislation set down by
Excom or the University. The evo
lution of such conflicting legisla
tive power was an anachronism of
the old constitution.
