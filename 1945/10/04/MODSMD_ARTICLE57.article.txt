# TO ALL STANFORD WOMEN
## 
### 
Would you care to meet the man
of your dreams, have him hold you
close, whisper sweet nothings in
your ear? All this and with a ro
! mailtie background of music sup-
I plied by Shaw, Miller and Martin,
can be had at the Army dance Fri
day night at the Pavilion.
With the return of the one to one
ratio we can once more promise you
any type of man you wish, fat or
; thin, tall or short, clad in Khaki,
navy blue or grey flannel. As this
is the first Army dance of the quar
-1 tcr we are hoping for a large turn
j out ol you new Stanford Papooses
lof Roble as well as the older
Squaws of Lag, Branner and the
Row.
The music promises to be straight
from the "Hit Parade," with plenty
of variety, sweet for the dreamers,
hot for the jivers and Latin for you
Rhumba fiends, through the cour
tesy of Stanford University's own
nine tube Juke Box.
Refreshments as usual will be
served by the Palo Alto branch of
the Red Cross.
Remember, Friday, 8:30 until
i 11:30 p.m. at the Pavilion, you have
j a date with your dream man.
Edwards and
Fleher
