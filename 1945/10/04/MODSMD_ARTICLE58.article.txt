## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
The Stanford "Y" of 1905, organ
ized one year after Stanford Uni
versity, had 110 members, designated
by the constitution as "the lady stu
dents and teachers of the institution.''
Fifty-three years ago, the YWCA
made its start on the new campus,
there were only 500 women at Stan
ford, with a ratio of three men for
even woman enrolled. Since that
time, the "Y" has been one of the
most continuously effective organi
zations at Stanford, with the gener
ous support of the administration.
Now beginning another year with
the annual membership chive, offi
cers of the organization hope to top
the 1056 membership rolled up last
year.
Continuity and stability are main
tained through an advisory board of
faculty wives and Palo Alto women
who, individually, are leaders in all
phase!- of community life. Some of
its members serve on "Y" commit
tees with Stanford women.
Dean Mary Yost and Mrs. Donald
Tresidder are life members of the
board. "Dean Yost, as a continuing
member of the board ,has been one
of our most cooperative supporters,"
commented "Miss Pat," executive
secretary of the campus YWCA.
Honorary members of the "Y" ad
visory board are Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Mrs. David Starr Jordan,
Mrs. Rufus J. Green, Mrs. J. W.
Mitchell, Mrs. John C. Branner, and
Mrs. Herbert Hoover. Mrs. Louis

Lindborg is present president of the
"Y" advisory board.
Mrs. Rufus L. Green was president
of the first advisory board, at its
organization in 1005.
The YWCA began Vocom, the In
ternational Club, and the sponsor
system at Stanford. With a history
of continuous service, it also began
the first Red Cross unit at Stanford,
supported the War Board, and has
been actively filling the needs of
Stanford students, both men and
women.
The "Y" lounge, on the third floor
of the Women's Club House, is open
for student use every day of the

The Stanford "Y" of 1905, organ
ized one year after Stanford Uni
versity, had 110 members, designated
by the constitution as "the lady stu
dents and teachers of the institution.''
Fifty-three years ago, the YWCA
made its start on the new campus,
there were only 500 women at Stan
ford, with a ratio of three men for
even woman enrolled. Since that
time, the "Y" has been one of the
most continuously effective organi
zations at Stanford, with the gener
ous support of the administration.
Now beginning another year with
the annual membership chive, offi
cers of the organization hope to top
the 1056 membership rolled up last
year.
