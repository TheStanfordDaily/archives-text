# Navy Men Start PT Instruction
## Lt. W. Williams Directs Navy Sports Program 
### 
The N.R.O.T.C physical training
program got under way last Wed
nesday under the direction of Lt.
W. H. Williams, physical training
officer for the unit.
The men are mustered four days
of the week at the men's gym for
the training which usually lasts for
an hour and a half. Here they are
segregated in several groups, each
of which is under the watchful eye
of an instructor.
Tht instructors for this program
were chosen by the Navy for this
duty because of their qualifications
as coaches and by their knowledge
in the handling of men. Each in
structoi knows what is expected of
him and all are doing their utmost
to fulfill this duly. Their work is
taken in earnest because they
would like to have the men in the
pink of condition as soon as possible.
The first day the instructors put
the men through a strength test to
determine how well the men were
in condition. This test consisted of
push-ups, pull-ups, and other cales
thentics of this nature. A student
has to pass the test with an average
grade of 55 before he will be able
to compete in activities other than
the basic program.
The morning following the first
days' training there were quite a
number of students who were com
plaining because of stiff muscles and
sore legs, but after a few sessions
on the athletic field they will be
limbered up and ready to really
start the ball rolling.
