### JIMMY KOPP 
And so ended N.R.O.'s first week
as Stanford students. No hits, no
runs, no more blind dates! Some
unhappy victim suggested that a
date bureau, giving such vital sta
tistics as height, age and special in
terests, might not be a bad idea for
getting acquainted.
Some of you old "Farm hands"
had better take a little refresher on
those Stanford yells, because by the
time ye old football season rolls
around the N.R.O. boys are really
going to know their yells. Who
wouldn't be interested in learning
yells when a car full of those gor
geous Union gals come by Toyon in
the evening and give a serenade in
the form of Stanford yells. Believe
me the fellas are learning fast. (The
yells I mean.)
Final measurements for Navy
midshipmen's uniforms were taken
last Friday and so on approximately
October 15 the N.R.O. boys will be
putting their monkey suits away
in moth balls and stepping out in
their new zuit suits. They arc
bound to feel a little conspicuous
at first, so please, girls, don't yell
"Taxi!" when you first get a glimpse
of that billed officer's hat with a
quarter-inch gold stripe and an an
chor on it. Two sets of khaki are
on the issue list also, along with the
blue suit, and it is assumed that
they will be the uniform for class
work. Just in case anyone has
trouble distinguishing the Navy
from the Army in their khakis, re
member that the Navy boys will
still be wealing black shoes.
