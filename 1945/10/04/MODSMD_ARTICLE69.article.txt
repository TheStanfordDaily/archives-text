# Speech Clinic Under Dr. Anderson Aids Correction of Individual Voice Defects
## Farm Clinic Good; Could Lead West 
### BETTY BARLOW 
Usually the work done backstage
is little known to the public, and
such is the case of the speech clinic
that is organized here on our
campus.
Since the Speech Clinic was first
established in the autumn of 1932,
a total of 693 persons, a major por
tion of them Stanford students,
have received remedial treatment
for speech problems in the clinic for
periods ranging from one quarter
to two years.
Dr, Virgil Anderson, whose office,
204 A in the history corner, has
served as headquarters, has been di
rector of the clinic since the begin
ning, and prior to 1938 he did all of
the chnic work himself, in addition
to a full load of regular classes in
speech. This fall Dr. Charlotte
Well;?, who received her Ph.D from
the University of Wisconsin, came
to Stanford from Mt. Holyoke to
assist Dr. Anderson in the corrective
speech program.
Handles Spcech Problems
During the first few years of its
existence, the clinic membership
was made up almost entirely of stu
dents who went voluntarily for help
with their speech problems. At
present this group accounts for
about half the clinic enrollment,
which averages over 100 registra
tions per year. The rest are sent in
by advisers, deans, health services,
speech instructors, or as a result of
the education speech test for pros
pective teachers.
This method, according to Dr.
Anderson, is inadequate because it
fails to reach many who need help
the most. Students interested in
correcting their speech defects
should see either Dr. Anderson or
Dr. Wells about doing work in the
clinic.
Individual Work
All clinic cases are met and
worked with individually, since
group or class work is impractical
in many instances, and of much less
value to the individual in all cases.
Dr. Anderson has no time at the
present for direct work with the
speech cases, but he supervises stu
dent clinicians, who serve a kind of
internship in the clinic. As yet
Stanford has no special funds to
cover a speech clinic, although many
universities have a budget for such
purposes.
Virtually every type of spcech de
fect and disturbance has been

treated, from severe stuttering,
through foreign dialect, cleftpalate,
defects resulting from loss of hear
ing, juvenile voice, delayed spcech,
and lisping, to defects of voice and
speech related to serious personality
and emotional disturbances.
Cures Juvenile Voices
Many cases of juvenile voice do
not realize that they have a true
adult, voice which they only need
learn to use. Dr. Anderson helped
one boy to find his real voice in 15
minutes, and to show the contrast,
a record was made half in the ado
lescent voice and half in the new
lower pitched voice. The Speech
Clinic has many "before and after"
records on file that illustrate their
progress better than any statistics
ever could.
As yet no school in the West has
a program to compare with those
found in the several schools in the
Middle West. Several western uni
versities stand ready, however, with
a substantial beginning, to make a
bid for leadership in this field on
the Pacific coast.
Stanford Could Lead
Stanford has established a sound
reputation, and according to Dr.
Anderson, could become a leader if
it supports the program actively.
Support of a speech clinic would
be for the benefit of the average
Stanford student and would build
up an important area of professional
training.

Dr, Virgil Anderson, whose office,
204 A in the history corner, has
served as headquarters, has been di
rector of the clinic since the begin
ning, and prior to 1938 he did all of
the chnic work himself, in addition
to a full load of regular classes in
speech. This fall Dr. Charlotte
Well;?, who received her Ph.D from
the University of Wisconsin, came
to Stanford from Mt. Holyoke to
assist Dr. Anderson in the corrective
speech program.
Handles Spcech Problems
During the first few years of its
existence, the clinic membership
was made up almost entirely of stu
dents who went voluntarily for help
with their speech problems. At
present this group accounts for
about half the clinic enrollment,
which averages over 100 registra
tions per year. The rest are sent in
by advisers, deans, health services,
speech instructors, or as a result of
the education speech test for pros
pective teachers.
This method, according to Dr.
Anderson, is inadequate because it
fails to reach many who need help
the most. Students interested in
correcting their speech defects
should see either Dr. Anderson or
Dr. Wells about doing work in the
clinic.
Individual Work
All clinic cases are met and
worked with individually, since
group or class work is impractical
in many instances, and of much less
value to the individual in all cases.
Dr. Anderson has no time at the
present for direct work with the
speech cases, but he supervises stu
dent clinicians, who serve a kind of
internship in the clinic. As yet
Stanford has no special funds to
cover a speech clinic, although many
universities have a budget for such
purposes.
Virtually every type of spcech de
fect and disturbance has been

treated, from severe stuttering,
through foreign dialect, cleftpalate,
defects resulting from loss of hear
ing, juvenile voice, delayed spcech,
and lisping, to defects of voice and
speech related to serious personality
and emotional disturbances.
Cures Juvenile Voices
Many cases of juvenile voice do
not realize that they have a true
adult, voice which they only need
learn to use. Dr. Anderson helped
one boy to find his real voice in 15
minutes, and to show the contrast,
a record was made half in the ado
lescent voice and half in the new
lower pitched voice. The Speech
Clinic has many "before and after"
records on file that illustrate their
progress better than any statistics
ever could.
As yet no school in the West has
a program to compare with those
found in the several schools in the
Middle West. Several western uni
versities stand ready, however, with
a substantial beginning, to make a
bid for leadership in this field on
the Pacific coast.
Stanford Could Lead
Stanford has established a sound
reputation, and according to Dr.
Anderson, could become a leader if
it supports the program actively.
Support of a speech clinic would
be for the benefit of the average
Stanford student and would build
up an important area of professional
training.
Usually the work done backstage
is little known to the public, and
such is the case of the speech clinic
that is organized here on our
campus.
Since the Speech Clinic was first
established in the autumn of 1932,
a total of 693 persons, a major por
tion of them Stanford students,
have received remedial treatment
for speech problems in the clinic for
periods ranging from one quarter
to two years.
