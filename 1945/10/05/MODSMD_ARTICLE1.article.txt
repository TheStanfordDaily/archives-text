# Rally Groups To Reorganize
## P. Whittemore and E. Mitguard Will Lead in Postwar Stunts 
### MARTHA SCHWIMLEY 
Here it comes, Indians! The Rally
Committee with its white sweaters,
parades along the row, and Big Game
bonfires is being reorganized. With
the reinstatement of this committee,
which was disbanded in the spring
of 1943 because of a lack of pre
war activities, Stanford is once again
on its way to dreams of a Rose
Bowl victory.
Patty Whittemorc and Eugene
Mitguard have been appointed co
chairmen of the reorganized Rally
Committee by Cardinals, which
must approve all actions of the com
mittee. Old Rally Com members,
Julie Crommelin and Mary Jane
Clatworthy will help with the com
mittee's reconstruction.
Plans Indefinite
As yet plans for the Rally Corn's
work this quarter are indefinite due
to Stanford's uncertain athletic fu
ture. However, announcement will
soon be made concerning student
tryouts for the committee, according
to Patty Whittemorc. Membership
in the old Rally Committees was
about 36, but, until the Cardinals
are really rolling again, the mem
bership will be fairly small.
According to an old ASSU con
stitution, the Rally Committee con
sisted of twenty men, divided into
two classes. Ten of the students in
the second class were sophomores.
The Women's Committee, which
worked in conjunction with the
Rally Com consisted of sixteen
women, divided into two classes. The
heads of these two groups were co

chairmen of the Rally Committee.
Bob Kennedy, ASSU president,
states that the reorganized commit
tee wiil be along these lines.
Trvoutecs' Requirements
Any student with at least sopho
more standing and a C average could
try out for the Rally or Women's
Committee. New requirements will
be announced as soon as they are
decided by Cardinals and the new
Rally Committee co-chairmen.
The Rally Committee handles
parades, rooting sections, game
stunts, ticket sales promotion, and
rallies. In 1941, it was this group
that managed the train rallies which
began with a parade down the row
and ended at the S.P. station where
some of the student body left for
off-campus football games.
Parades Planned
The Big Game parades, complete
with floats and ending with a rally
and bonfire, arc planned by this com
mittee. It was also the Rally Com
which planned the first spring Sing
in 1941. The committee is important
in keeping school spirit at a high
pitch. It backs all Stanford teams,
winning or losing, and keeps Farm
students behind these teams.
This year, whether the first game
is football or basketball, the Rally
Committee will be there to direct
the rooting section and give stunts.
The committee may not start right
in with its old glamour of wrapping
the goal posts and producing spec
tacular card stunts but those white
sweaters will be in evidence. The
Rally Committee is back and so is
a peacetime Stanford!

Rally Committee is back and so is
a peacetime Stanford!
Here it comes, Indians! The Rally
Committee with its white sweaters,
parades along the row, and Big Game
bonfires is being reorganized. With
the reinstatement of this committee,
which was disbanded in the spring
of 1943 because of a lack of pre
war activities, Stanford is once again
on its way to dreams of a Rose
Bowl victory.
Patty Whittemorc and Eugene
Mitguard have been appointed co
chairmen of the reorganized Rally
Committee by Cardinals, which
must approve all actions of the com
mittee. Old Rally Com members,
Julie Crommelin and Mary Jane
Clatworthy will help with the com
mittee's reconstruction.
Plans Indefinite
As yet plans for the Rally Corn's
work this quarter are indefinite due
to Stanford's uncertain athletic fu
ture. However, announcement will
soon be made concerning student
tryouts for the committee, according
to Patty Whittemorc. Membership
in the old Rally Committees was
about 36, but, until the Cardinals
are really rolling again, the mem
bership will be fairly small.
According to an old ASSU con
stitution, the Rally Committee con
sisted of twenty men, divided into
two classes. Ten of the students in
the second class were sophomores.
The Women's Committee, which
worked in conjunction with the
Rally Com consisted of sixteen
women, divided into two classes. The
heads of these two groups were co

chairmen of the Rally Committee.
Bob Kennedy, ASSU president,
states that the reorganized commit
tee wiil be along these lines.
Trvoutecs' Requirements
Any student with at least sopho
more standing and a C average could
try out for the Rally or Women's
Committee. New requirements will
be announced as soon as they are
decided by Cardinals and the new
Rally Committee co-chairmen.
The Rally Committee handles
parades, rooting sections, game
stunts, ticket sales promotion, and
rallies. In 1941, it was this group
that managed the train rallies which
began with a parade down the row
and ended at the S.P. station where
some of the student body left for
off-campus football games.
Parades Planned
The Big Game parades, complete
with floats and ending with a rally
and bonfire, arc planned by this com
mittee. It was also the Rally Com
which planned the first spring Sing
in 1941. The committee is important
in keeping school spirit at a high
pitch. It backs all Stanford teams,
winning or losing, and keeps Farm
students behind these teams.
This year, whether the first game
is football or basketball, the Rally
Committee will be there to direct
the rooting section and give stunts.
The committee may not start right
in with its old glamour of wrapping
the goal posts and producing spec
tacular card stunts but those white
sweaters will be in evidence. The
Rally Committee is back and so is
a peacetime Stanford!
