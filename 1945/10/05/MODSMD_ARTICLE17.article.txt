# No Attendants—No Music Room
## 
### 
The music listening room cannot
possibly open Monday unless more
students volunteer to be attendants,
Jackie Jardinc, chairman, said yes
terday.
The room is' entirely student-run,
and each attendant takes charge for
an hour. Records arc purchased aft
er a popular vote is taken and the
professors of the Division of Music
arc consulted. All types of records
are represented—anything from a
symphony orchestra to boogie
woogie.
The music listening room will stay
open as continuously as possible all
quarter, Miss Jardine said. Exact
hours will depend upon student at
tendants.
Students interested in working as
attendants should call Miss Jardinc
at Manzanita.
