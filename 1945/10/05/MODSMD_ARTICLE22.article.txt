# Football Waits Schwartz' Coming
## 
### 
At a late hour last night, football
coach Marchie Schwartz had not
arrived on campus, A 1 Masters, gen
eal manager of the 8.A.C., said. It
is felt that an announcement on this
fall's football situation will be
forthcoming soon after Mr. Schfartz
arrives and confers with Dr. Donald
B. Tresidder and Mr. Masters.
The proposal to schedule a game
with the University of California
late in November is one of the mat
terms that will be discussed after
Mr. Schwartz' arrival on the Farm.
Coach Schwartz will call for a
football turnout shortly after his
arrival on campus, it is understood.
