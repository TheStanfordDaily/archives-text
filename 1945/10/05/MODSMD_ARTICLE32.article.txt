# CAL-STANFORD, TOGETHER
## 
### 
Apparently all the talk about post-war problems has not been
evaporated by the heat of conversation. At the invitation of the
University of California, eleven Stanford students will confer
for the next two days with student leaders at Berkeley, in an
attempt to face the problems which both schools recognize as
the ones which hold the balance between a university at v/ar
and a university at peace.
The vigorous spirit which prompted the conference will, we
hope, be carried to Cal tomorrow by our representatives. Some
of the topics on the agenda concern defects which have been
recognized by other Excorns in other years, but with the return
of what Dr. Tresidder yesterday termed an average student body,
the problems are thrown into relief against a comparative nor
malcy which is able to receive and effectively overcome them.
To face these problems now is both wise and expedient. We
have long been prompted by discussion of reconversion-to-come,
but unless Stanford—and other universities—are immediate in
their decisions and far-seeing in their actions, it is probable that
the time for any reconversion at all will have passed us by, and
left us with the feeling that there had been no actual recognition
of the differences between the Stanfords that existed before and
after Pearl Harbor.
Under the heading of student body and membership, repre
sentatives from the two Universities will discuss the quality of
activities sponsored within recent years and proposed for the
year to come. They will concern themselves with the lack of
sfudent interest in certain phases of government and'".activities,
and in doing so, hope to see at what point the established stu
dent leaders failed to attract student support and to what extent
the students were at fault in not responding.
They will discuss the present systems of each for receiving
veterans, for integrating them into student life. They will ques
tion the relationships between administration and the student
body, the authority held by both. Student-faculty relations—the
problems of unusually large classes and increased demands upon
faculty members for advisorial services—will also be reviewed.
The differences between the locations, the administrative set
ups and the student bodies of the two schools are so great as to
necessitate different approaches to most phases of student rela
tions. However, the contrasts themselves should prove valuable
in provoking thought as to underlying reasons for the existence
cf certain long-standing practices.
The idea of such a conference between Cal and Stanford may
with advantage ripen into a series of such conferences, which
could include other universities—for despite differences such
as those mentioned above, the problem of each in reconversion
is not unique. Whether or not such conferences would be worth
while can best be determined by the vigorous and thoughtful
participation of each member of our representative contingent,
both during, and in the weeks succeeding, today's conference.—

the time for any reconversion at all will have passed us by, and
left us with the feeling that there had been no actual recognition
of the differences between the Stanfords that existed before and
after Pearl Harbor.
Under the heading of student body and membership, repre
sentatives from the two Universities will discuss the quality of
activities sponsored within recent years and proposed for the
year to come. They will concern themselves with the lack of
sfudent interest in certain phases of government and'".activities,
and in doing so, hope to see at what point the established stu
dent leaders failed to attract student support and to what extent
the students were at fault in not responding.
They will discuss the present systems of each for receiving
veterans, for integrating them into student life. They will ques
tion the relationships between administration and the student
body, the authority held by both. Student-faculty relations—the
problems of unusually large classes and increased demands upon
faculty members for advisorial services—will also be reviewed.
The differences between the locations, the administrative set
ups and the student bodies of the two schools are so great as to
necessitate different approaches to most phases of student rela
tions. However, the contrasts themselves should prove valuable
in provoking thought as to underlying reasons for the existence
cf certain long-standing practices.
The idea of such a conference between Cal and Stanford may
with advantage ripen into a series of such conferences, which
could include other universities—for despite differences such
as those mentioned above, the problem of each in reconversion
is not unique. Whether or not such conferences would be worth
while can best be determined by the vigorous and thoughtful
participation of each member of our representative contingent,
both during, and in the weeks succeeding, today's conference.—

Apparently all the talk about post-war problems has not been
evaporated by the heat of conversation. At the invitation of the
University of California, eleven Stanford students will confer
for the next two days with student leaders at Berkeley, in an
attempt to face the problems which both schools recognize as
the ones which hold the balance between a university at v/ar
and a university at peace.
The vigorous spirit which prompted the conference will, we
hope, be carried to Cal tomorrow by our representatives. Some
of the topics on the agenda concern defects which have been
recognized by other Excorns in other years, but with the return
of what Dr. Tresidder yesterday termed an average student body,
the problems are thrown into relief against a comparative nor
malcy which is able to receive and effectively overcome them.
To face these problems now is both wise and expedient. We
have long been prompted by discussion of reconversion-to-come,
but unless Stanford—and other universities—are immediate in
their decisions and far-seeing in their actions, it is probable that
the time for any reconversion at all will have passed us by, and
left us with the feeling that there had been no actual recognition
of the differences between the Stanfords that existed before and
