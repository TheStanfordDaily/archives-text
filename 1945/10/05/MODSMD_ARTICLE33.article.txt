# BULL SESSION

### Cathiyn Owen 
This is taking place in a shower in a hall. Any shower or
any hall. Let's make it a men's hall, though. The tubless atmos
phere makes things more realistic. A men's hall with women
living in it. (Ad Building propaganda: In a world, grown wild
during war years, the Standards of Stanford's no, no, mustn't,
mustn't morals have remained unchanged.)
The water is regulated just right and the person under it is
singing for the joy of her unscalded skin. She's all alone, and
la-de-da, but it's fun—strictly fiendish type —to watch all the
little fleas wash down the drain.
Then the door slams. Our bather draws the nearest shower
curtain belligerently around her. She shouts above the raging
plumbing.
"Get out—l don't wanta join the 'Y'!"
The newcomer pulls her shower cap coyly over her eyes —
lightens the valves and prepares to dive —and screams back.
"Why? Because I wanta be clean."
"You can go ahead and join—l don't wanta be clean."
By this time, a second shower is booming, which makes for
all the more fun.
"But, I didn't ask you to join me. I always take my shower
alone."
"I don't care what you say. I'm not gonna join."
They're silent for a while, and pay attentio»-to the slightly
chlorinated efforts of the Paly Public Utilities Commission. Then
the second shower tries to be agreeable again.
"Do y' know v/hen the Quads are coming out?"
"I won't either come out. I was here first."
Showers still pounding—bathers still screaming.
"That's what I mean, the first one. And when're we supposed
to have our pictures taken for the second one?"
"Listen, I've gotta lot of self-respect, and if you think I'm
gonna have a photographer coming in here—! If that's the kind
you are, ycu should've gone to art school!"
"You loo? Aren't Dali and Thurber and couple of right guys,
though?"
At this point, the first woman of the shower is being blase
about the whole thing, and is unconcernedly plucking her eye
brows, chewing off her nails, and carrying on numerous other
shower activities.
The second one is still eager. She scales the shower wall
and coyly dumps a package of bubble bath powder on the per
son's head.
"La-de-da, bubbles to you," she shouts.
"You can't talk to me that way." And immediately the be
bwbbled one goes into action.
The next morning, they found the woman of the shower cap
r sting peacefully with an economy size cake of Ivory nearby.
So ends the first chapter of "What to Do in the Dorm After
10:30."
