# Robinson Relates New US History
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
With the definition of political
history as man's every attempt to
govern himself, Dr. Edgar Eugene
Robinson, head of the Department
of History, told the American Stud
ies Symposium audience yesterday
that the citizens of a democracy
must be told the political story, not
the facts — "mountains of facts" —
about their nation or the democracy
will cease to function.
"We live in a new space and time;
the psychology of the man of today
is not that of Andrew Jackson or
Benjamin Franklin," Dr. Robinson
said upon outlining a five-point pat
tern for "a new American history."
Public Opinion
First, Dr. Robinson said, more
material must be presented on ge
ography, advances in transportation,
communication and especially pub
lic opinion.
Secondly, he stressed that more
time must be given to the history of
the last fifty years. "It is not merely
a flight of fancy to say that we
have lived a hundred years in the
last five years. . . . Why hang onto
a story which is written with the
psychological viewpoint of past
times?" the speaker stated as his
third point.
"We need the history of Ameri
cans in their new habitat — the
world," was Dr. Robinson's fourth
point, "Americans abroad and their
relations with other people."
History Record
Fifthly, the record must be pre
sented positively, clearly, so that

it will interest all the people, not
only the scholars, and the political
history must guide the story.
Dr. Robinson, first of the Humani
ties-sponsored symposium speakers
this quarter, further stated that he
as a historian is interested in the
record contained in the minds and
emotions of the people of today.
Stanford as Example
Using the story of the Stanford
community as an illustration, Dr.
Robinson said that if the actual his-

Tory were to be written it would
have to be found in the letters, dia
ries and memoirs of the people who
have lived here, in the newspapers
of the time, and the historian would
be obliged to explain the causes,
effects, results and motives of the
facts.
"Today we are making history,
but few outside of the profession
realize that there is more to his
tory than the simple facts," he said.
Dr. Robinson is Margaret Byrne
Professor of American History and
has been at Stanford since 1911.
Arthur E. Bestor, chairman of
the Symposium committee, intro
duced the speaker.

EDGAR E. ROBINSON
With the definition of political
history as man's every attempt to
govern himself, Dr. Edgar Eugene
Robinson, head of the Department
of History, told the American Stud
ies Symposium audience yesterday
that the citizens of a democracy
must be told the political story, not
the facts — "mountains of facts" —
about their nation or the democracy
will cease to function.
"We live in a new space and time;
the psychology of the man of today
is not that of Andrew Jackson or
Benjamin Franklin," Dr. Robinson
said upon outlining a five-point pat
tern for "a new American history."
Public Opinion
First, Dr. Robinson said, more
material must be presented on ge
ography, advances in transportation,
communication and especially pub
lic opinion.
Secondly, he stressed that more
time must be given to the history of
the last fifty years. "It is not merely
a flight of fancy to say that we
have lived a hundred years in the
last five years. . . . Why hang onto
a story which is written with the
psychological viewpoint of past
times?" the speaker stated as his
third point.
"We need the history of Ameri
cans in their new habitat — the
world," was Dr. Robinson's fourth
point, "Americans abroad and their
relations with other people."
History Record
Fifthly, the record must be pre
sented positively, clearly, so that

it will interest all the people, not
only the scholars, and the political
history must guide the story.
Dr. Robinson, first of the Humani
ties-sponsored symposium speakers
this quarter, further stated that he
as a historian is interested in the
record contained in the minds and
emotions of the people of today.
Stanford as Example
Using the story of the Stanford
community as an illustration, Dr.
Robinson said that if the actual his-

Tory were to be written it would
have to be found in the letters, dia
ries and memoirs of the people who
have lived here, in the newspapers
of the time, and the historian would
be obliged to explain the causes,
effects, results and motives of the
facts.
"Today we are making history,
but few outside of the profession
realize that there is more to his
tory than the simple facts," he said.
Dr. Robinson is Margaret Byrne
Professor of American History and
has been at Stanford since 1911.
