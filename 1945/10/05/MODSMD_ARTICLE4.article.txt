# Two Choirs Set For Sunday's Service
## 
### 
Two choirs will sing at the Sun
day morning service at 11 a. m. in
the Memorial Church, and an organ
recital will be given by Warren D.
Allen, university organist, there at
4 p.m.
This is the first time in history
that two choirs have sung in the
services. One of the choirs, to be
dressed in cardinal, will lead a pro
cessional to the Chancel while the
other will sing from the Organ Gal
lery. The sermon will be given by
Dr. Trucblood.
