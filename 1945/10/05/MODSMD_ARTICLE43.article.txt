### 
The old question of free trade,
again important in the light of com
plex postwar problems, was taken
up by debaters yesterday as they
met to make a preliminary analysis
of the problem. At a meeting lively
with questioning, speakers pointed
to the significance of free trade con
siderations and presented a variety
of definitions, as well as points of
view from which the matter may be
discussed.
"Although free-traders seem to
have the majority in our group, I
liked the spirit of objectivity that
prevailed," said Pat Blair, debate
manager "This is particularly im
portant for tournament debating
where we must be prepared to speak
on either side of a question, regard
less of our private opinions."
The group will meet again Tues
day afternoon at 4 in room 200T of
the History building to make a
further study of the problem, ac
cording to Leland T. Chapin, faculty
