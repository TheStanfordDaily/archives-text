# Dr. Tresidder Lauds Spirit

### 
Addressing Stanford's first post
war assembly yesterday morning,
President Donald B. Tresidder re
minded the men and women that
the primary purpose of Stanford
University is to aid the student in
finding the wisdom and judgement
that helps people to live a full life
in a free society. The promise of
the survival of free people is great
er today in America, he stated, than
in any other part of the world—a
survival which depends wholly on
reflection and definite affirmative ef
fort by trained leaders in meeting
problems squarely with intelligence.
"This,'' said Dr. Tresidder, "is no
longer of prime importance, and we
are back to the 'business' of school."
A definite feeling of gaiety is in
the air, he said—a feeling augment
ed by the rapid increase in cars on
campus, the return of many faculty
members until now serving the gov
ernment at home or overseas, the
prospect of the old red barn's re
opening, and the return to average
of a ratio, formerly disproportion
ate, between the young and the old
at Stanford.
Commenting on this last, Dr.
Tresidder said, "we welcome the
sight of a student body that is av
erage in this proportion—although
it was charming to see Stanford
coeds mothering our sixteen-year
olds."
Stalnaker Introduced
As one of the highlights of the
assembly ,Dr. Tresidder introduced
Mr. John M. Stalnaker, a new Dean
of Students, who expressed the be
lief that with Stanford's pep and
vigor to cope with them, there
would be no reconversion problems.
Following the introduction of this
year's Excom, Bob Kennedy, ASSU
head, appealed to the student body,
saying "Here we go! Give us some
ideas!"'
Newt Arnold, newly-elected cheer
leadei, led the Stanford spell yell
and "Come Join the Band." The
meeting concluded with the singing
of the Stanford Hymn.
