# Bracken Musical Amusin'Confusin'
## 
### 
"Out of this World," now at the
Stanford, has music by Bing Crosby
sung by Eddie Bracken impersonat
ing Frank Sinatra .... but it's real
ly entertaining confusion.
Bing . . . rather Eddie, sings some
good numbers; "Out of This World,"
"I'd Rather Be Me," and "June j
Comes Around Every Year." When I
you get used to Bing's voice com
ing from Bracken as "The Voice,"
"Out of This World" begins to come
somewhere near its title.
Bracken or Bing
The "Crosby kids" turn in some j
good scenes. When all four turn up j
in the orphanage where Eddie sings
a benefit, one quips, "You know Pop j
and his horses."
Veionica Lake, all hair and little
sense of humor, takes a back seat i
to Diana Lynn as a nineteen year J
old band leader.
The story ambles around Bracken. !
a Western Union messenger boy who I
croons his way to headlines, then j
finds five people have 125 per cent |
interest in his earnings.
Mobs—Sinatra Style
Thr higher mathematics balance
in the end, after Bracken is alter
nately mobbed, steamed, chilled, and
nearly drowned.
Particularly good scenes: A tiny
timid old lady, under the spell of
"The Voice," moves toward Bracken
with a trance-like look as he sings,
"I'd Rather Be Me." Also good . . .
the scene where an old Western Un-

ion messenger, being tutored by j
Bracken, goes out the door singing
"June Comes Around Every Year," |
also in Crosby's voice.
Tokyo Spy Stuff
"First Yank Into Tokyo," was a
'B' picture that kept the audience >
gripping the collapsible Stanford '
seats. The film that scooped every
other studio in the industry by us
ing the atomic bomb as a center of
espionage, it was too bad to waste
such good propaganda with the war
over.
Tom Neal, an American Army ma
jor, is sent to Japan to rescue an
enginter who has the formula on
the atomic secret. As hackneyed as
the plot may seem, special horror
is injected when the major has a
complete face lifting by Army
surgeons to make him into a Jap.
It's alright, until he finds the
nurse he was engaged to marry in
a Japanese prison camp instead of
dead on Bataan, and realizes that
he will always have a Japanese face.
It sounds unconvincing, but some
how the show didn't leave you that
wa}'.— Ayres.

"First Yank Into Tokyo," was a
'B' picture that kept the audience >
gripping the collapsible Stanford '
seats. The film that scooped every

It's alright, until he finds the
nurse he was engaged to marry in
a Japanese prison camp instead of
dead on Bataan, and realizes that
he will always have a Japanese face.

Bing . . . rather Eddie, sings some
good numbers; "Out of This World,"
"I'd Rather Be Me," and "June j

"Out of This World" begins to come
somewhere near its title.
