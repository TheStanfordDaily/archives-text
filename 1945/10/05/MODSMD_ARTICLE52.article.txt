# Big Turnout At Basketball
## 
### 
Over fifty prospective Stanford
melon men greeted Coach Everett
Dean as fall basketball practice offi
cially got under way last Wednes
day.
Unable to say much about the type
or ability of the material that will
be under his tutorship this quarter,
the casaba mentor is preparing a
questionnaire for his men so that he
can get acquainted with them and
their previous experience.
About the only experienced bas
ketball player that has come to the
Daily's attention is Dave Brown,
former all-coast football end and
first string guard on the U.C.L.A.
court team. A Navy med student
at San Francisco, Brown organized
the independent student team last
year, and will play league ball this
year if he is eligible.
