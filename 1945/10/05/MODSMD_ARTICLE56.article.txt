# Greenberg's Homer Wins Second Tilt
## 
### 
DETROIT, Oct. 4.-(UP).-Virgil
(Fire) Trucks and big Hank Green
berg, two guys home from the wars,
hurled and homered the Detroit
Tiger? back into the 1945 world se
ries today as they led the Bengals
to a 4 to 1 victory over the Chicago
Cubs in the classic's second game.
Trucks, an Irish Indian fireball
pitcher who returned last week
after two years in the navy, pulled
the Tigers even with the Cubs at
one game each as he silenced the
crashing Cub bats with seven
scattered hits. And Greenberg,
the husky, hawk-nosed outfielder
who came back from the army
in mid-season, blasted a 375-foot,
three-run homer in the fifth in
ning rally which brought the Ren
gals from behind and provided
their winning margin.
Greenberg Slams Homer
Just as when the Tigers wrapped
up the American League flag, once
again it was the rangy Henry Benja
min Greenberg who came through
with the round trip blast which was
the business. The Tigers had
matched the Cubs' fourth inning
run when Big Hank stepped up
there to the plate with two men on
and two away.
He looked at a couple while the
crowd of 53,636 fans sat in tense
and electric expectation. Then Hank
Wyse, the Cub starting pitcher, be
came the loser of the game. The
young curve bailer put one of his
pet pitches high and insideâ€”and it
immediately became Greenberg's
favorite. Hank uncoiled and the
crowd gave an ear-splitting roar as
the ball sailed into the left center
field stands, 375-feet from home
plate.
That was all Trucks needed to
comc home in front.
Cubs Rally in Fourth
With one away in the fourth, Phil

Cavarietta came through with a
double to center. Alter Andy Pafko
grounded out Bill Nicholson caught
one ol Trucks's fast ones and his
single to right put the Tigers one
run behind as Cavarretta came
home. Trucks put out the fire then
but that one run looked mighty big
the way Wyse was pitching.
Bengals Move Ahead
That was the situation when the
Tigers came up for their licks in
the fifth. Then, with two away,
Skeeter Webb set them on the way
with a single to left center and was
pushed to second as Eddie Mayo
walked. Cramer whipped a single
down the left field foul line to send
Webb in with the tying run.and
Mayo slid safely into third.
Then up stepped Greenberg, the
six foot, three inch .slugger, who
returned July 1 after serving as
a captain with the I) Bomber
Command in the C.8.1, theatre.
And he proved to be the man for
the job as he blasted Mayo and
Cramer home ahead of him with
the winning runs.
Passeau vs. Overmire
The Cubs were far from gloomy
in their dressing room and had
plenty of praise for Trucks. Manager
Charley Grimm said he would at
tempt to get the lead again tomor
row by using the veteran Claude
Passeau, a 17-game winner.
Manager Steve O'Neill and his
gang were jubilant and the big Irish
man said his choice for the third
and last Detroit game in the best
four out of seven series would be
Stubby Overmire, winner of nine
this reason.
