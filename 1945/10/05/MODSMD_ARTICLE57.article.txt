The other day two keen horsemen
were discussing all hot tips at the
various bangtail tracks over in the
jockey's club-house, or the more
lamiliar name, the Reserved Book
Room. They had just about come
to the conclusion that Bushel Basket
was about the fastest thing on four
feet that ever existed, when some
gal who happened to overhear this
feed-box jabber, started tellin' the
Horse and Handbook set fellows a
thing or two. Before she got through
she had quoted morning work-out
figures at Jamacia; fifth race results
at Kollypark as compared to Del
Mary steeple chase runnings at Cali
ent?; and far stretch running at Nar
agansett. . . . When, this modern
living!
Pete Gray, the sensational one
armed baseball players puts in
several bay area appearances this
week and would give anything to
see the fellow in action. Last sea
son he played with the St. Louis
Browns, his first year in big league
competition. His playing or hit
ting was nothing extraordinary,
hut who did hit well in the Am
erican League during the season?
Rumors have been afloat that he
might be shipped down the river to
a lower league, but no official word
has come out of the Brown front
office as yet. But when it comes to
passing out medals for courage and
spirit. Gray wins in ouV depart
mentâ€”and about everyone else's,
too.
So a San Francisco journalist
doesn't think that a student
shouldn't be barred from athletics
if he has deficient grades. The
writer believes that the idle time
will be put in madhouses, and
other such worthless activities, if
hteii time isn't absorbed in prac
tice. His solution to the problem
is to give the student an extra
two or three units necessary to
get a sheepskin and let it go at
that.
That's like giving a guy with brok
en cartilages a 500 pound weight to

drag around to help his back. The
purpose, as we understand it, of
prohibiting deficient grade gatherers
from sports is so they will have
time to make up the minus credits.
