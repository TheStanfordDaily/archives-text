# Coast Netters Tops in Nation
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Over a period of many years, it
has been noticeable that not only
the local but also the national ten
nis scene has been dominated by
Californians. With the exception of
a few net stars who have developed
in other parts of the United States,
an overwhelming percentage of West
Coasters have been listed yearly
among the ranking greats.
Youngsters Take Over
Even with the passing of many of
these terrific performers, the Golden
State is not likely to give up its
dominance of the racket sport very
easily. As each star from the west
either turns pro or retires from ac
tive competition, another deity with
the advantage of youth springs up
to take his place.
As the Don Budges leave the
amateur courts, the sunny state
produces a new and promising
crop. Right now, such teen-agers
as Ted Falkenberg and Herbic
Flam, who claimed the national
juiiioi title in consecutive years,
are knocking off older and more
mature players. That these two
boys will probably*tight it out for
the national and perhaps the in
ternational championship someday
soon goes without saying.
And they are not the only ones.
Cal Tennis Hot Bed
There are a host of other future
top-notchers trading shots on courts
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Santa
Monica and other California tennis
hot beds.
Western Women Tops
We've limited ourselves to the dis
cussion of the male angle so far,
but ll is worthy to note that five
out of the top six women players
this year were from California. The
lone femme from another state was
Doris Hart of Florida.
As a matter of fact, it is rather
silly to have the National Tennis
Tournament at Forest Hills, New
York, every year. The A.A.U. could
save a great deal of expense money
by holding them right here in Cali
fornia.
