# UN CAPITOL
## 
### 
Stanford University has been
prominently mentioned as a possible
site foi the United Nations capitol.
Many newsmen in San Francisco
were advocating the building of the
UNO headquarters at Stanford long
before the official vote in London
yesterday that made the United
States, at least, the territory in
which the capital would be located.
