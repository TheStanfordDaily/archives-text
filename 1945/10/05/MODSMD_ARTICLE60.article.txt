# AST Cagers Begin Play
## 
### 
AST basketball got off to a flying
start last Wednesday night in the
men's gym—at least it was such a
case for half of the teams that op
ened the season. Except for one
contest, final scores were slightly of
the lopsided type.
One big upset appeared after the
cessation of hostilities as the A. T.
& Q. Club had nosed out the highly
favored operating under the ban
ner. "The Chickens." The surprise
victors are men that only joined the
unit a few weeks ago and the
"Chickens" were expected to "pick"
them apart with their lough-house
tactics. Expectations are not always
fulfilled, however, and a spirited
second-half comeback produced a fi
nal count of 17-15 for the A. T. &
Q's. (Ed. note —It beats me what
A.T.&Q. means).
A smooth working outfit by the
name of "Coots" completely out
classed their "Giant Five" oppon
ents to the tune of 32-7 in one of
the most lopsided tilts. The Giants
are also new men on campus and
incidentally had but one player over
5 feet, 7 inches.
With Polan dumping twenty-two
of their thirty points through the
the "Shushies" overcame the
"B.F.'s" The latter collected but
seventeen marks on their side of the
ledger. The only other contest that
might have been called anything
like close was a 36-28 battle between
the "Lillywhites" and the "Runts"
with the Runts hanging on to the
anemic end of the ratio.
Apparently both teams were mis
named in the fray featuring two
groups tagged as "Bums" and "Zip
pers." Anyhow the Bums failed to
live up to their name and man
hanalcd the "Zippers," 30-15. Hed
rick and Bonifay proved to be the
biggest factors in taking the zip out
