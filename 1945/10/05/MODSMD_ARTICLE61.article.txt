LOS ANGELES. Oct. 4.â€”(UP)~
Rcservc players will see action most
of the time against the College of
Pacific Friday night. University of
California at Los Angeles Football
Coach Bert La Brucherie said to
day.
La Brucherie said he hadn't altered
the line-up because he considered
COP a breather, but because his
squad had suffered many injuries
in two tough games with the Uni
versity of Southern California and
the San Diego Naval Training Sta
tion.
But even the UCLA reserves
shoulu have little trouble with Amos
Alonzo Stagg's Tigers, his most
feeble edition to date. After losing
two and tying one game against
minor opposition, the Tigers dropped
a (59 to 0 decision to St. Mary's Pre-
Flighl last week.
