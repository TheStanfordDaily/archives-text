# A
						Veteran Looks at Stanford.... An Open Letter
## 
### DON ALLAN 
Stanford has opened her arms to
her returning veterans about as wide
as a prohibition speakeasy opera
tor used to open his Judas window.
Old students returning for the first
time in years were embarrassed and
disappointed.
New students entering under the
government program were plainly
disgusted. Some of the advance in
formation veterans received about
Stanford was found to be hokum;
most of the publicized veteran's aid
facilities were found to be poorly
conceived and executed, and defi
nitely inadequate.
If the University is interested
in keeping the veterans just now
enrolled, if she wishes to attract
more of these men and women,
and more important, if she wants
to demonstrate her respect and
interest in those champions of
liberal and unrestricted education,
and wants to play an important
part in educating young Ameri
cans for an enlightened and
peaceful future, she must improve

her policy lownrd veterans at
once.
THIS LOVELY WAY
WASN'T SO
The first information the prospec
tive returnee has of Stanford is
furnished by a small publication
entitled "Educational Opportunities
for Veterans." In this booklet vet
erans are advised that they each
will be provided with a personal ad
viser, a kindly and interested indi
vidual qualified both to cope with
problems unique to veterans and to
assist them in selecting and plan
ning specific educational programs.
Coordinating the efforts of these
service Samaritans and ready to re
solve the more intricate veterans'
problems is an adviser-in-chief.
This pamphleteer's pantdise
does not exist in fact. Applicants
who were able to visit the uni
versity before Registration Day
were met by secretaries who
couldn't tell a gob from a gyrene,
or talked with men who seemed
to have memorized all the nega
tive technicalities of the G. I.
Bill, and who had great difficulty
translating their knowledge into
terms of specific individual prob
lems. The majority of the appli
cants were dismissed with vague
requests for additional forms or
data, or similar run-arounds.
On registration Day the impres
sion the veteran received of Stan
ford and her preparations to receive
him was still more discouraging.
Lines extended well outside the
doors of the Administration Build
ing. On the inside the confusion
and congestion left him dazed and
baffled. While new and old civilian
students had separate lines ar
ranged alphabetically, the veterans
were all in one line, by far the
largest of the whole group.
AROUND AND AROUND
HE WENT
One line led him into the Dean's
office, where after hours of waiting
he was told where to go and what
to do before he could come back
and see him again. An emergency
buffer squad of secretaries seemed
totally ignorant of even the rudi
mentary terminology and problems
of the veteran. Up and down, round

and round the bewildered returnee
shouldered his way through the
crowd. Hour after hour he stood in
line in the hope that at the end he
might encounter someone who
could speak his language, who could
get him enrolled. A good number
spent the whole day on the Quad
and still failed to get registered.
FAMILY HOUSING? NO!
If he had a wife the poor vet was
sunk. The University noted inci
dentally in its pamphlet that a large
number of returnees would be
bringing wives and families. And
just as casually it announced that
no special effort would be made to
assist these men in finding homes.
The same card file which was em
ployed in finding rooms for the few
score married students before the
war would be available to
who wished help in housing.
On the one hand Stanford ad
mits that many more married
men than ever before will plan to
enroll under the G. I. Bill, while
on the other baud she declares
that no measures will be taken to
facilitate housing for them.
Obviously no student will do good
work, or remain long in a school
where he has to commute 90 miles
a day and get up at 6:00 to make
an 8 o'clock. This pronouncement
of the University seems to be a
blunt and significant indication of
the shortsightedness of her policy
toward veterans.
When the veteran is ready to se
lect his program he will find that
he can do nothing until he inspects
the time schedule. This year it was
not on sale until three days before
Registration Day, and few veterans
had a chance to consult it before
the hour ol' making out their pro
gram.
WHERE WERE THE ADVISERS?
The lower division veteran soon
found that his allegedly informed
and sympathetic adviser was no
more informed or interested than
the Dean's secretaries. The upper
division applicant was not assigned
a special adviser. Both had to wait
long in line and were hurriedly dis
missed.
When he first attended class the
vet could not help noticing the fact
that 80 percent of his classmates
were very young women. And in
many cases in non-scientific courses
he was annoyed to discover that the
:professor in charge had slanted his
lecture approach to appeal to this
type of audience.
No normal man will resent be
ing surrounded by numbers of at
tractive women, but he will cer
tainly become vexed at endless
classroom witticisms and will
wince at the answering wavelets
of soprano tittering.
THE SHAPE OF THINGS
TO COME?
These are a few of the difficulties
and disappointments which confront
the discharged soldier who enters
Stanford. The grumbling voices
from the Reg line will be heard by
hundreds of potential Stanfordites.
The word will be passed around.
Stanford must at once recognize the
fact that she is not satisfying her
present veteran students.
What can she do to improve the
present situation? The factors of
university finances, manpower
shortages, material shortages and
government committments might
restrict the degree to which re
forms might be made. However, it
is easier to advance by falling
short of an ideal standard than
by surpassing a compromise one.
If the following suggestions may
not be carried out under present
conditions, at least they can rep
resent a goal.
SPECIALIZED, SYMPATHETIC
HELP
The Dean and the Registrar
should get rid of their secretarial
assistants who are uninformed on
vet problems. In their place they
should hire students who have re
cently enrolled under the vet plan.
This could be done on a part-time
basis. Many of these vets find it
difficult to get along on I he gov
ernment allotment, and would wel
come this part-time employment
for which they are eminently quali
fied.
Other veterans applying for in
formation would gain confidence
and a good impression of the school

by talking out their problems with
men who know, from personal ex
perience, all the angles of Stanford
and of the G. I. Bill. The lime
saved would be proof of the ineffi- j
ciency of the old system. This staff
could be increased at anticipated
rush hours, for example, during va
cations and during the registration
days.
Every prospective applicant
should be furnished with a list
of all the papers, documents, and
signatures lie must have to enter
the University and where he may
obtain them, so that no veteran
will be sent back for lack of prop
er papers when he applies on Reg
Day.
PLAN FOR REGING
The Reg Day mess could be
straightened out very simply. Stan
ford's organization compares very
unfavorably with Army organiza
tion. The school could take a tip
from the Army, and run veteran
applicants through with army pre
cision and dispatch.
Either the Auditorium or the Ed
ucation Building should be set aside
for vet registration. All applicants
should be told beforehand to be
present at the designated building
(the way to the building should be
clearly marked with numerous
signs) at 8 a.m.
As they enter the building they
should be handed a mimeographed
sheet of instructions and a scchd
ule for the day. They should then
be seated in the theater seats, and
be given a short explanatory lec
ture. Reg books could be distrib
uted to each man. They would
then fill out each page according
(o instructions, with the exeep- j
lion of the study sheet.
Questions would be answered by
the lecturer from the stage. Tui
tion deferment would then be ex
plained and petition forms distrib
uted, and questions answered on
this problem. The same procedure
next be followed in filling out
blanks for the Veteran's Adminis
tration.
STUDENT ADVISERS NEEDED
Before dismissing the group, the
lecturer would explain the adviser
system. Four special advisers would
be provided for each major depart
ment and for the graduate schools.
Five advisers would be on hand for
lower division students. Two ad
visers would be furnished for a
special "Provisional Department,"
which will be explained below.
A classroom in the same build
ing should be assigned to each de
partment and its advisers, each of

whom will have a table in the
room. The chairs in the room may
be placed at one end for waiting
in line. Advisers would take ap
plicants in turn, "A" through "H"
to be handled from 10 to 12, "I"
through "P" from 1 to 3, and "Q"
through "Z" from 3 to 5. This
would eliminate congestion, make
waiting time shorter and more
comfortable, and permit each ad
viser to give more time to each
man.
The classrooms would be clearly
marked, and arrows would point
the way to each one, and being in
the same building, would be easily
found, eliminating the prevalent
aimless wandering around the cor
ridors of the Quad.
After the lecturer had dismissed
the group, the men would file
out through four exits. At each
exit a representative of the cash
ier's department would take de
ferment forms, and stamp the
registration book. And at the end
of the applicant's interview t with
his adviser, the adviser would
tear out the department schedule
slip and place it in one pile, tear
out the remaining slips, staple
them and place them in another
pile for the Registrar's office,
stamp the applicant's student body
card, give it to him. throw the
empty book in a wastebaskct, and
viola! the vet is registered.
Two appointments in one central
building, one short wait (seated),
precise, unambiguous, and special
ized information, and, don't forget
. . . no unsightly pile of empty reg
books on the floor!
WHERE TO LIVE?
During the free hours of the day,
before or after the veteran has
seen his adviser, he might go to the
Dean's office where the chief vet
eran's adviser and his student staff
will be awaiting to answer detailed
questions. Or he might visit the
office of the housing adviser.
Worry over housing, inadequate
housing, or long distance commut
ing will undoubtedly have a bad
effect on many veterans' school
work. Long ago Stanford should
have realized this and prepared to
meet the situation.
WHY NOT THIS?
The University owns many square
miles of untaxed, empty land adja
cent to the campus. Surplus Quon
set huts make decent two-family
They are prefabricated, easy
to transport and erect. A very few
'furnishings, such as beds, linen and
blankets, tables, chairs, stoves and
heaters, and plumbing fixtures are
also cheaply obtainable from Army
and Navy surplus property stocks.
Twenty of these huts could be
erected in the vacant lots behind
Encina, Toyon, and Branner, close
to water and power lines. Commun
ity showers and laundries, a play
ground area operated in conjunction

with classes from the Psychology
and Physical Education depart
ments, and a community parking
lot might complete such a small
Veteran City. Forty families would
be thus housed at low rents which
would defray a good part of the ex
pense of the project.
Another possibility is Los 'fran
cos Woods. This is a real estate
subdivision in the hills behind
Woodsidc. It is entirely composed
of small vacation cabins. These
houses are seldom used by their
owners after September. If the
University made a direct appeal
to all the owners of these cabins,
many families might find cheap
housing for the rest of the school
year, after which time the present
housing shortage may be relieved.
WANTED: HOUSING ADVISER
Whatever the remedy, the Uni
versity desperately needs a hous
ing adviser; a man whose sole du
ties would be to do some of the
searching and worrying now done
by veterans who can ill afford the
time, and to collect and reserve
housing offers available to help the
veteran find a home for his family.
It has been suggested above that
the present number of university J
advisers be substantially increased |
to detail a special corps to the vet- ]
erans. This is suggested both for j
speed and for specifically vet- |
slanted advice.
Of the four men assigned as ad
visers from each major depart
ment, three need only be instruc
tors, graduate students, or senior
students selected for the job by
the department head. The fourth
. adviser should be either the de
partment head, or a high-ranking
professor.
These men should spend at least
a few hours reviewing the G. I. Bill
and in learning the University pol
icy on the transfer of credits from
other schools and credits to be
granted for service schooling. As
far as possible they should be se
lected from men who have been j
in the service or have some other
qualifying experience with veterans'
problems.
THEY HAVE CHANGED
A great problem confronts many
men and women who entered the
service just after they graduated
from high school or in their first
years of college. They were induct
ed before they had a chance to de
cide upon a direction for their
lives. In the normal course of j
events, they would have made this j
decision or had it made for them
by the time four college years had j
elapsed.
The war transported them into
a very different world, and after
a few eventful and character- j
changing years, deposited them ;
once again in school. Many have I
returned to school mainly because
it was the last thing they were |
doing before entering the service,
bccause they feel that it is the
only thing for which they are j
equipped, as an escape from the
problem of deciding upon a career,

and in the hope of finding the
answer lo this question in school.
These individuals cannot honestly
select a major subject. All stu
dents should be required to take
a vocational aptitude test, and any
student who has not decided what
he is aiming for in life should have
a special deportment to fit his needs.
HOW TO PICK A MAJOR
This department might be called
the Provisional Department. It
would carry students for no longer
than a year. At the end of a year
provisional students would have to
select a major. The department
would offer a wide variety of
courses designed to stimulate the
student's curiosity.
It would give him a brief glimpse
of the many possible subjects lie
might later choose as a major. It
would feed his imagination, expand
his viewpoint, and help him to or
ient himself. As soon as space and
manpower permit, more seminars
and small sections should be or
ganized.
Instructors should be made to
realize that school for the veteran
if not for the more youthful un
dergraduate, is a serious business.
It is a job to be undertaken se
riously and completed as fast as
possible. The veteran has not time
to snicker at classroom comics
when they come at the expense
of learning.
Perhaps more serious than the
specific problems outlined above is
the broader problem which they re
flect: Stanford's attitude toward
these new additions to her family.
The fact that they exist indicates
than Stanford has not given suffi
cient consideration, and certainly
not Sufficient action on the problem
of veterans.
MAKE HIM ONE OF
STANFORD FAMILY
The returning soldier does not
want to be set apart from his fellow
students. He wants to "return to
normalcy" and be absorbed into
the current of civilian society as
smoothly and rapidly as possible.
On the other hand, he knows that
thex - e are special difficulties which
will accompany his return to school,
and he does not want the school
to ignore these difficulties or him
self.
He will not tolerate the added
difficulties or inefficiency and ig
norance on the part of the Univer
sity. Service men are used to brisk,
unequivocal methods oil military

routine. University inefficiency
comes as a marked contrast which
leaves a poor impression.
TIIE CHALLENGE TO
STANFORD
He does not demand any payment
on society's debt to him, but he will
appreciate tangible evidence that
his school is understanding and is
sympathetic with the problems he
and his family face, and is inter
ested enough to help. If he can't find
this interest here, he will go some
where else.
And the recent publicity given
some forcsighted universities has
been noticed by tbusands of scrv
iccmcnt who intend to return to
school, and will not be forgotten
by an equal number of high school
students and parents when their
time comes to sclcct a university.
In (bis competitive world Stanford
must compete, and today she is
dangerously behind the field.
KLAIIOYA MEETING
Members of Klahoya, organization
for off-campus women, will meet
Friday, October 12 at 3:30 p.m. in
the Women's Clubhouse for party,
including singing and entertainment,
President Audrey Jacobs has an
nounced.

Don Allan, author of the article appearing on this page, is a
former Stanford student who left the Farm in the fall of 1942 to
join the service. He became a bombardier with the rank of sec
ond lieutenant in August, 1943, and was sent overseas the fol
lowing February.
In July of 1944 his plane, a B-24, was shot down while on a
mission over Budapest. He was taken prisoner and spent the
duration in Stalag Luft 111 in Germany.
He escaped from prison camp on April 4 this year, and the
first American group he met, on April 24, was the Fifteenth Army
Corps commanded by his father, Col. C. V. Allan.
A journalism major, Allan edited the Chaparral summer quar
ter of 1942. He came back to Stanford this fall, following his
discharge, and is now living in Woodside with his wife, the
former Marge Emlay, also an ex-Stanford student.
Returning to Stanford, he came in contact with the University
veterans' program in operation—and didn't like what he saw. The
Daily publishes his article, not as the final or correct solution lo
a complex problem, but as an indication to students and Ad
ministration of what seems to be the reaction among some Stan
ford veterans returning to the campus.
As in all undertakings, however, there are two sides to the
problem. With the war ending as quickly and unexpectedly as
it did, and with a far greater number of students and veterans
applying for entrance than was ever anticipated, it would be
ridiculous to censure anyone for his inability to cope with a
situation which, in a sense, could not be helped. Stanford has
set up a committee which is now making plans to organize a
more efficient method of handling the problems of returning
veterans in the coming quarters.
The Daily hopes that through the publication of Don Allan's
article the Administration, with its long-range planning, and the
veteran, with his immediate needs, may recognize and find a
common ground on which to work.—The Editor
