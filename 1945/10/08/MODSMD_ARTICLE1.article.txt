After a week of deliberation and
tense waiting on the campus, A1

night that "it is impossible for Stan
ford io field a team against the Uni
versity of California this Fall." And
with this decision all hopes for a
Bis; game in November have seem
ingly been crushed.
Speculation as to the possibility
of a Big Game reached a high point
over the weekend when Marchie
Schwartz, head football coach, ar
rived from his war-time Omaha
home to confer with President Don
ald B. Tresidder and Mr. Masters.
An announcement was expected as
a result of this meeting and the an
nouncement came in a negative
form.

Until this announcement came
there was high hope at Stanford
that Coach Schwartz would attempt
to arrange a schedule for the latter
part oi this season. But Mr. Masters,
in his announcement said, "it
wouldn't be fair to the boys to pit
them against a veteran aggregation
like California that has played a
number of games'.'
Nevertheless Coach Schwartz, who
returned to the Farm Saturday
morning to resume his coaching po
sition, was jubilant about the re

turn of the Stanford Indian to the
athletic warpath.
Call for Practice Soon
"A call for football practice will
| be announced shortly," Schwartz
i said. He expressed hope that some
j informal games might be arranged
J at a later date. Gridiron talent on
| the Farm right now is an unknown
quantity and quality, so the squad
chief wants to see what's on hand
! before an definite plans are made.
One thing, however, Marchie is
certain of, and that is that he will
use the T formation. He was sold
on the "T" in '40 and '41, when he
worked as an assistant coach to
Clark Shaughnessy. Having served
under the present Pitt mentor who
started a new era in American foot
ball. he will put to good use at Stan
ford all the information he got at
close hand those two years.
Ex-Notrc Dame Star
In his collegiate days at Notre
Dame Schwartz played left half
back under the immortal Knule
Rocknc, and was a unanimous A11 -
American choice for two years.
After Marchmont got his sheep
skin in '.'{2, he stayed at his alma
mater for a couple of years as
backfield coach under 'Hunk' An
derson, besides working for his
law degree.
In 1935 he moved over to Creigh
ton as athletic director and head
football coach. His postal address
remained Omaha for five years, dur
ing which he turned out exception
ally fine squads at the big Medical
and Dental University of the Mid
west.
In 1940 he came to Stanford to
serve under Clark Sliaughnessy.
No small part did he play in mold
ing the powerful backfield unit
of Standlee, Alberts. Kmetovic,
and Gallcrneau. In '4:5 he took over
the main reins of the team,
, Shaughnessy having left for the

University of Maryland and Jim
Lawson for the Navy. His squad
really started rolling the last part
of the season, finishing second in
the I'.C.C.
Sports Discontinued
A Spring practice was held the
following year, but players were
heading for Uncle Sams' outfits
faster than flour goes through a
sieve, so the decision was made to
drop intercollegiate sports.
Mr. Head Grid Man took a leave
of basence and headed for Wichita,
where the next few years were
spent working in a managerial ca
pacity for an oil company.
Schwartz is very optimistic about
the football future at Stanford. He
has kept in contact with the boys
who played for him in '42, and all
have signified an intention of re
turning to Stanford as soon as they
are released from the armed service.

"A call for football practice will
| be announced shortly," Schwartz
i said. He expressed hope that some
j informal games might be arranged
J at a later date. Gridiron talent on
| the Farm right now is an unknown
quantity and quality, so the squad
chief wants to see what's on hand
! before an definite plans are made.
One thing, however, Marchie is
certain of, and that is that he will
use the T formation. He was sold
on the "T" in '40 and '41, when he
worked as an assistant coach to
Clark Shaughnessy. Having served
under the present Pitt mentor who
started a new era in American foot
ball. he will put to good use at Stan
ford all the information he got at
close hand those two years.
Ex-Notrc Dame Star
In his collegiate days at Notre
Dame Schwartz played left half
back under the immortal Knule
Rocknc, and was a unanimous A11 -
American choice for two years.
After Marchmont got his sheep
skin in '.'{2, he stayed at his alma
mater for a couple of years as
backfield coach under 'Hunk' An
derson, besides working for his
law degree.
In 1935 he moved over to Creigh
ton as athletic director and head
football coach. His postal address
remained Omaha for five years, dur
ing which he turned out exception
ally fine squads at the big Medical
and Dental University of the Mid
west.
In 1940 he came to Stanford to
serve under Clark Sliaughnessy.
No small part did he play in mold
ing the powerful backfield unit
of Standlee, Alberts. Kmetovic,
and Gallcrneau. In '4:5 he took over
the main reins of the team,
, Shaughnessy having left for the

University of Maryland and Jim
Lawson for the Navy. His squad
really started rolling the last part
of the season, finishing second in
the I'.C.C.
Sports Discontinued
A Spring practice was held the
following year, but players were
heading for Uncle Sams' outfits
faster than flour goes through a
sieve, so the decision was made to
drop intercollegiate sports.
Mr. Head Grid Man took a leave
of basence and headed for Wichita,
where the next few years were
spent working in a managerial ca
pacity for an oil company.
Schwartz is very optimistic about
the football future at Stanford. He
has kept in contact with the boys
who played for him in '42, and all
have signified an intention of re
turning to Stanford as soon as they
are released from the armed service.

After a week of deliberation and
tense waiting on the campus, A1
Masters, graduate manager, said last
night that "it is impossible for Stan
ford io field a team against the Uni
versity of California this Fall." And
with this decision all hopes for a
Bis; game in November have seem
ingly been crushed.
Speculation as to the possibility
of a Big Game reached a high point
over the weekend when Marchie
Schwartz, head football coach, ar
rived from his war-time Omaha
home to confer with President Don
ald B. Tresidder and Mr. Masters.
An announcement was expected as
