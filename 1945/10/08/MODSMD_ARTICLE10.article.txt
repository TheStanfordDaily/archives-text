# FARM VETERAN COMMITTEE WILL 'TALK IT OVER' TONIGHT
## Stalnaker Expresses Interest in Problems 
### 
(Editorial note: The following is a letter from
Dean of Students John M. Stalnaker which we feel
is oi interest to all Stanford student.)
To the Editor:
I have read with interest the story by Don Allan in
your issue of October 5, 1945. We are all vitally con
cerned with seeing that the vetei'ans returning to
Stanford are absorbed into the regular student body as
smoothly and as rapidly as possible.
Furthermore, we want to see that the veterans and
all other students are treated with courtesy, given
efficient and prompt service and help with the paper
work of registering and filling out*

the required governmental forms.
Some of the points of adverse
criticism which Mr. Allan makes
arc, I believe, justifiable. Other
points seem to me to be exag
gerated. and still others based on
erroneous information. This office,
of course, will always be «lad to
supply such information as it has
when requested to do so.
Before this article appeared, Mr.
Favilie and I had been planning an
open meeting of the Veterans Com
mittee to discuss any special vet
erans' problems and to attempt to
determine appropriate action to rec
tify any conditions which are now
in need of improvement. The mat
ter had been discussed with the
students of the Student Relations
Committee.
Arrangements have been made
to have this meeting on Monday
evening, October 8, at 7:3ft in Cuh
bcrley Hall in the Education
Building. It is my hope that a
frank and open discussion of some
of these problems may aid us in
reaching the best possible solu
tion. All interested veterans
should be urged to attend.
Sincerely yours,
JOHN M. STALNAKER
