# Peace Reigns At Farm-Cal Discussions
## 
### 
Cal and Stanford faced each oth
er on the debate field Friday and
Saturday when representatives from
both schools met at the University
of California to discuss problems
of student government and activi
ties. veterans, and relationships be
tween student body administration,
and iaculty—a conference proposed
by the A.S.U.C. Committee on Inter-
Campus Conferences to take the
place of the Pacific Coast Student
President Association which was
handicapped in its activities during
the war.
First meeting of the two-day con
ference was held Friday night in
Eshelman Hall on the Cal Campus
where delegates discussed student
body and membership and veterans'
problems, recognizing first the dif
ference between schools in enroll
ment.
Led by moderator Don McNary
from California, students exchanged
comments on the effect of compuls
ory student body membership
(Stanford's system) and voluntary
membership (Cal) on student ac
tivities and government. The Stan
ford system of orienting freshmen
to student government and activi
ties in their living groups through
the sponsor system was explained
and California delegates outlined
the duties of their A.C.C., the com
mittee through which activities are
coordinated.
Politics Considered
The question of political cam
paigning and machines in student
government was considered, with the
general conclusion that such prac
tices unless they serve a beneficial
function to the student body are a
menace, but do bring interest to a
campaign.
California delegates were inter
ested in the Stanford system of re
quiring that reports be made by the
heads of various activities and filed
with the student manager at the
year'.' end.
Vets' Problem
The discussion of veterans' prob
lems was summarized by moderator
Myron E. Krueger, University of
California veterans' coordinator,
who said that vets do not have
entirely separate problems from
those of any student; that housing is
the critical problem for every uni
versity; that the universities of the
country have been lax in not re
gard'ng housing as an integral part
of education; and that practically,
veterans cannot be given complete
priorities in enrolling in courses.
Continuing the conference Sat
urday morning, the delegates, with
Edwin C. Voorhies, Cal dean of stu
dents as moderator, explored the
field of student body and faculty
relationships, agreeing generally
that defective teaching methods do
hamper student-faculty relations.
Throughout the discussion it was
clearly emphasized that improve
ment in relations depended in large
part upon more courtesy on both
sides.
Hearing of Stanford faculty-stu
dent social relations, including
faculty dinners, firesides, and teas,
Cal delegates agreed that there was
a definite need for such functions
on their campus.
Favoritism Debunked
California representatives brought
up the subject of absolute and av
erage grading systems. It was agreed
that the grading system in both
schools needs improvement and that
there must be no favoritism shown.
The last topic, student bodv and
administration, moderated by Morris
A. Stewart, assistant dean of the Cal
graduate division, brought into dis
cussion problems of better coopera
tion between administration and
student? and extent of dependence
of the student government on the
university. Consideration was made
of the advisability of having an ad
ministration representative on the
student Excom, as at Cal. Differ
ences in disciplinary procedure be
tween universities was discussed, as
well as difficulties in obtaining fa
cilities at Cal for all-university as
semblies.
Hope To Continue
At the conclusion of the discus
sions California and Stanford rep
resentatives expressed the hope that
such conferences be continued in
the future and that through the ex
ercise of courteous treatment mu
tual problems may be solved.
Dean Voorhies stated that confer
ences like this will lead to better
relations in all parts of the uni
versity and between Stanford and
California.
After the debates delegates ate
lunch together, then attended the
Cal-Washington football game.

The delegates from Stanford were:
Bob Kennedy, B. J. Calfee, Sylvia
Davis, Helen Dietz, Crane Honey

ford system of orienting freshmen
to student government and activi
ties in their living groups through
the sponsor system was explained
and California delegates outlined
the duties of their A.C.C., the com
mittee through which activities are
coordinated.
Politics Considered
The question of political cam
paigning and machines in student
government was considered, with the
general conclusion that such prac
tices unless they serve a beneficial
function to the student body are a
menace, but do bring interest to a
campaign.
California delegates were inter
ested in the Stanford system of re
quiring that reports be made by the
heads of various activities and filed
with the student manager at the
year'.' end.
Vets' Problem
The discussion of veterans' prob
lems was summarized by moderator
Myron E. Krueger, University of
California veterans' coordinator,
who said that vets do not have
entirely separate problems from
those of any student; that housing is
the critical problem for every uni
versity; that the universities of the
country have been lax in not re
gard'ng housing as an integral part
of education; and that practically,
veterans cannot be given complete
priorities in enrolling in courses.
Continuing the conference Sat
urday morning, the delegates, with
Edwin C. Voorhies, Cal dean of stu
dents as moderator, explored the
field of student body and faculty
relationships, agreeing generally
that defective teaching methods do
hamper student-faculty relations.
Throughout the discussion it was
clearly emphasized that improve
ment in relations depended in large
part upon more courtesy on both
sides.
Hearing of Stanford faculty-stu
dent social relations, including
faculty dinners, firesides, and teas,
Cal delegates agreed that there was
a definite need for such functions
on their campus.
Favoritism Debunked
California representatives brought
up the subject of absolute and av
erage grading systems. It was agreed
that the grading system in both
schools needs improvement and that
there must be no favoritism shown.
The last topic, student bodv and
administration, moderated by Morris
A. Stewart, assistant dean of the Cal
graduate division, brought into dis
cussion problems of better coopera
tion between administration and
student? and extent of dependence
of the student government on the
university. Consideration was made
of the advisability of having an ad
ministration representative on the
student Excom, as at Cal. Differ
ences in disciplinary procedure be
tween universities was discussed, as
well as difficulties in obtaining fa
cilities at Cal for all-university as
semblies.
Hope To Continue
At the conclusion of the discus
sions California and Stanford rep
resentatives expressed the hope that
such conferences be continued in
the future and that through the ex
ercise of courteous treatment mu
tual problems may be solved.
Dean Voorhies stated that confer
ences like this will lead to better
relations in all parts of the uni
versity and between Stanford and
California.
After the debates delegates ate
lunch together, then attended the
Cal-Washington football game.

Saturday when representatives from
both schools met at the University
of California to discuss problems
of student government and activi

place of the Pacific Coast Student

First meeting of the two-day con

where delegates discussed student

problems, recognizing first the dif

veterans cannot be given complete
priorities in enrolling in courses.
Continuing the conference Sat
urday morning, the delegates, with
Edwin C. Voorhies, Cal dean of stu
dents as moderator, explored the
field of student body and faculty
relationships, agreeing generally
that defective teaching methods do
hamper student-faculty relations.
Throughout the discussion it was
clearly emphasized that improve
ment in relations depended in large
part upon more courtesy on both
sides.
Hearing of Stanford faculty-stu
dent social relations, including
faculty dinners, firesides, and teas,
Cal delegates agreed that there was
a definite need for such functions
on their campus.
Favoritism Debunked
California representatives brought
up the subject of absolute and av
erage grading systems. It was agreed
that the grading system in both
schools needs improvement and that
there must be no favoritism shown.
The last topic, student bodv and
administration, moderated by Morris
A. Stewart, assistant dean of the Cal
graduate division, brought into dis
cussion problems of better coopera
tion between administration and
student? and extent of dependence
of the student government on the
university. Consideration was made
of the advisability of having an ad
ministration representative on the
student Excom, as at Cal. Differ
ences in disciplinary procedure be
tween universities was discussed, as
well as difficulties in obtaining fa
cilities at Cal for all-university as
semblies.
Hope To Continue
At the conclusion of the discus
sions California and Stanford rep
resentatives expressed the hope that
such conferences be continued in
the future and that through the ex
ercise of courteous treatment mu
tual problems may be solved.
Dean Voorhies stated that confer
ences like this will lead to better
relations in all parts of the uni
versity and between Stanford and
California.
After the debates delegates ate
lunch together, then attended the
Cal-Washington football game.

Cal and Stanford faced each oth
er on the debate field Friday and
Saturday when representatives from
both schools met at the University
of California to discuss problems
of student government and activi
ties. veterans, and relationships be
tween student body administration,
and iaculty—a conference proposed
by the A.S.U.C. Committee on Inter-
Campus Conferences to take the
place of the Pacific Coast Student
President Association which was
handicapped in its activities during
the war.
First meeting of the two-day con
ference was held Friday night in
Eshelman Hall on the Cal Campus
where delegates discussed student
body and membership and veterans'
problems, recognizing first the dif
ference between schools in enroll
ment.
Led by moderator Don McNary
from California, students exchanged
comments on the effect of compuls
ory student body membership
(Stanford's system) and voluntary
membership (Cal) on student ac
tivities and government. The Stan
ford system of orienting freshmen
to student government and activi
ties in their living groups through
the sponsor system was explained
and California delegates outlined
the duties of their A.C.C., the com
mittee through which activities are
coordinated.
Politics Considered
The question of political cam
paigning and machines in student
government was considered, with the
general conclusion that such prac
tices unless they serve a beneficial
function to the student body are a
menace, but do bring interest to a
campaign.
California delegates were inter
ested in the Stanford system of re
quiring that reports be made by the
heads of various activities and filed
with the student manager at the
year'.' end.
Vets' Problem
The discussion of veterans' prob
lems was summarized by moderator
Myron E. Krueger, University of
California veterans' coordinator,
who said that vets do not have
entirely separate problems from
those of any student; that housing is
the critical problem for every uni
versity; that the universities of the
country have been lax in not re
gard'ng housing as an integral part
of education; and that practically,
veterans cannot be given complete
priorities in enrolling in courses.
