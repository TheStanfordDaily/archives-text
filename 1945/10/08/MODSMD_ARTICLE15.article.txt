# Open Meeting for Vets To Be Held at 7:30 P.M.
## 
### 
An open meeting of the University Veterans' Com
mittee will be held in the Cubberley Auditorium of
the Education Building this evening tit 7:30, in order
to give student veterans an opportunity to offer sug
gestions to the board for rectifying any conditions they
may find objectionable, and for integrating them more
easily into University lile.
Plans for the meeting were made by Dean John
Stalnaker and Commit lee chairman Duvid Faville;
recent campus discussions of the veteran problem made
tonight seem the most appropriate time to hold it.
Completely informal, the meeting will give ample

'opportunity for veteran students to
address their suggestions and ques
tions to the members of the sub
committees examining their prob
lems. Dean Stalnaker, chairman of
the group studying and regulating
veterans' admission; Registrar Don
ald H. Winbigler, head of the sub
committee on testing; Dr. Paul
Farnsworth, of the counciling com
mittee, Mr. Raymond Harriman,
head of the Programs committee,
and Mr. Calvin Stone, in charge of
rehabilitation studies, will join Mr.
Favilie to form the faculty round
table.
Want to Help
"We want to help gel these men
into the swing of Stanford," said Mr.
Favilie. "We admit there have been
rough spots in the program, but
with an open discussion on what
has been done, what is going to be
done and what the veterans feel
should be done, we will feel better
equipped to continue our work on
the veterans' behalf." It is for these
reasons that Dr. Favilie asks all
veterans to be present at tonight's
meeting.
Registration, housing, the advis
ory program, and means of better
assimilating the veteran into social
and extra-curricular activities will
be on the mat for discussion, ac
cording to Dean Stalnaker.
Although the meeting is directed
at the veteran, all interested students
are welcome to attend, he added.
