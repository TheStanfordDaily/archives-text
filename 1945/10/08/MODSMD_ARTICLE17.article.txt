## Bull Session 
### Cathryn Owen 
It all started when some maniac spread the
word that the Navy had new uniforms—real
uneeforms with gold buttons and little anchors.
Being ever so slightly cautious, though, some
women insisted 011 seeing for themselves, be
fore they lore down their service flags. That's
when the boards were torn off of the Branner
windows facing Toyon.
The girls crawled into the Branner view rooms
and turned off the lights. There's something
about a silhouette, that a good look in the light
wrecks. Thus huddled about the window, they
opened their eyes.
GOOD HEAVENS
ft was all very confusing. Their uniforms
weren't new—in fact, I doubt, and we are quot
ing the girls huddled about the window, if those
things they v/ere wearing were uniforms at all.
WORTH SALUTING FOR
The only evidence of the"I ain't an erficer
and I ain't a gob" uniform was a tiny flash of
gold. The flash came from a itny object, prob
ably a hunk of braid, that was cautiously
brought from out of hiding by a Toyon inmate.
He held it in his cupped hands and looked care
lully about for spies after each rub he gave it
with his polishing cloth.
Then it ended. Someone dashed into the
Brannner box and, being unaware of the aloof
variety of eagerness that was prevailing,
switched on the lights and shouted "Geronimo."
And the Navy dived under their desks, never
more to live behind unshaded windows.
SAME OLD LEOTARDS
Then it was found out the hard way—by
phoning Toyon —that Stanford's fleet does NOT
have new uniforms.
Suggestion of the week: Why don't the Mer
chant Marine Cadets who invade the campus
every Sunday wear little signs on the backs
of their admiral - bellhop - Paly - High - R.O.T.C.
uneeforms to stop the spreading of wild ru
mors?
