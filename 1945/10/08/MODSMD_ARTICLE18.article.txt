Editor, Stanford Daily:
On behalf of the advisers for the Lower Divi
sion veterans, I would like to comment on a
part of the thought-provoking article Don Allan
sent to Friday's Daily. I desire particularly to
make clear that in so far as Don's gripes refer
to the Lower Division advising they apply al
most wholly to late registrants.
All Lower Division veterans who arrived at
Stanford in time for "New-Student Registration
Day"and who brought to their advisers proper
credentials were treated much as Don sug
gested. Each adviser met with his advisees as
a group for almost an hour, explained the de
tails of registration and the philosophy of the
Lower Division, and then interviewed each
advisee separately. Registration stopped offi
cially at 2:30 p.m. Some time ago the advisers
discussed Don's scheme of meeting students
in alphabetic order. This plan was discarded
as it seemed unfair to keep the Wings and the
Zings from favorite classes which close early.
So, instead, the order in which the students
were advised was chiefly by lot.
TREATED LIKE STANFORD FAMILY
Lower Division veterans who arrived on
Monday to resume their work at Stanford pre
sumably needed no group discussion and,
therefore, were treated like all other old mem
bers of the Stanford Family.
Don is correct in much that he says if it is
taken to refer to late registrants. Faculty ad
visers are not relieved of their regular teaching
joads. Hence the late registrants, and there
were legions of them, had to hunt down the
advisers between classes. The advisers may
have appeared hurried or harried when con
tacted near class time, but surely they were
not disinterested.
ADVISERS WELL INFORMED
Perhaps a comment should be made on Don's
charge that the advisers were not properly in
formed. I can only say that they are all old

timers from the Lower Division Committee and
know well the Lower Division requirements
and offerings. It is true that through no fault
of theirs the publication of the Time Schedule
was delayed. It is also true that many sections
closed early and that some confusion followed.
These and other difficulties quite understand
ably kept the advisers from doing what they
consider really first-rate jobs.
Members of the Committee on Veterans'
Counseling do no academic advising for the
Upper Division students since this work is en
tirely in the hands of the schools and depart
ments. The committee members merely stand
by to aid through bull and gripe sessions in
the adjustments to Stanford life. Nor do the
veterans' advisers have a part in the prelimi
nary contacts the veterans make with Stanford.
These functions are in the hands of the regular
contact groups. Lower Division advisers take
over only after the student has been given his
big yellow record card.
SUGGESTIONS WELCOMED
In closing may I express my satisfaction that
the plans Don suggested for the Lower Division
advising of veterans were in such close agree
ment with the program previously adopted by
Stanford. The members of the committee hope
that they will be able to devise better methods
for handling of the late registrants and will
welcome any suggestions along this line.
Sincerely yours,
Paul R. Farnsworth
Sub-committee on Veterans' Counseling
To the Editor:
The only consoling statement found on the
"Open Letter from a Veteran" page in today's
Daily is the fact that the editor considers it to
be the attitude of "some Stanford veterans."
As a veteran of somewhat comparable serv
ice background to Don Allan, I'd like to stick
an. oar on the other side of the boat and do a
little pulling for Stanford.
GRIPES NOT APPRECIATED
All the gripes and "feeling sorry for one
self" that were contained in today's letter are
things most vets had hoped to have left be
hind when they received that little white paper
saying they were out and civilians once more.
There apparently seems to be one of us who
liked the regimentation of Army life enough to
want to see it continued here at Stanford. On
that score I'd like to know just where in the
Air Forces Don Allan ever saw the high state
of processing efficiency he speaks of so highly
as "the Army way." From where I sat I must
have missed it, since even the personnel who
gave us our final discharge orientation talks
at Camp Beale were far more confused and
less informed than anyone I have yet contacted
officially at Stanford.
REG DAY MINOR PROBLEM
To my observation, the faults of Registration
Day weren't hard especially lor the veterans. (If
my memory is correct, there were far more
freshmen and transfers standing in the line in
the Ad Building at 5 p.m. than there were vet
erans.) Most of the faults of registration lines
and mobs affect all members of the student
body and, as such, are a student body prob
lem to be approached by any interested veteran
as a member of the student body, and not as a
veteran.
From the veterans' viewpoint there might
have been a few more bumps smoothed out in
the Dean's and Registrar's offices prior to Reg
Day, but is the road to registration so easy for
the incoming frosh or transfer that the veteran
can consider himself discriminated against?
Speaking for myself, I found ample help and
advice in the Registrar's office and the ques
tions they couldn't answer were the same ones
that even the Army educational advisers could
n't just a week before. "The Dean's secreta
ries," too, can hardly be called inefficient since
this was the first large veterans' Reg Day.
RECONVERSION PLANS GOOD
Don Allan has made some good points that
the Administration may see fit to carry out.
However, as the "Educational Opportunities
for Veterans" pamphlet points out, most of them
have already been placed in the University's
plan to aid the returning veteran. The sudden
ness of the war's end and the immediate in
crease in the discharge rate are enough excuses
as to why the Universe couldn't put all of the
plans into effect. Even the Army wasn't God
gifted and perfect enough to foresee the im
mediate problems of reconversion that would
arise with the war's end.
All of the student veterans want to become
a part of the University's life, and I side with
that majority who don't want any special or
ganization or distinctions to mar that return
to a normal Stanford life. However, to prevent
any misunderstanding as to how the veterans
feel, or what they expect, might it not be a good
idea to either get them together and let them
speak their mind, or poll them with a good
questionnaire and get a good cross-section of
their views, instead of letting individual "open
letters" speak for the entire group?

All of the student veterans want to become
a part of the University's life, and I side with
that majority who don't want any special or
ganization or distinctions to mar that return
to a normal Stanford life. However, to prevent
any misunderstanding as to how the veterans
feel, or what they expect, might it not be a good
idea to either get them together and let them
speak their mind, or poll them with a good
questionnaire and get a good cross-section of
their views, instead of letting individual "open
letters" speak for the entire group?
Yours truly,
Earl F. Schmidt. Jr.
Editor, Stanford Daily:
On behalf of the advisers for the Lower Divi
sion veterans, I would like to comment on a
part of the thought-provoking article Don Allan
sent to Friday's Daily. I desire particularly to
make clear that in so far as Don's gripes refer
to the Lower Division advising they apply al
most wholly to late registrants.
All Lower Division veterans who arrived at
Stanford in time for "New-Student Registration
Day"and who brought to their advisers proper
credentials were treated much as Don sug
gested. Each adviser met with his advisees as
a group for almost an hour, explained the de
tails of registration and the philosophy of the
Lower Division, and then interviewed each
advisee separately. Registration stopped offi
cially at 2:30 p.m. Some time ago the advisers
discussed Don's scheme of meeting students
in alphabetic order. This plan was discarded
as it seemed unfair to keep the Wings and the
Zings from favorite classes which close early.
So, instead, the order in which the students
were advised was chiefly by lot.
TREATED LIKE STANFORD FAMILY
Lower Division veterans who arrived on
Monday to resume their work at Stanford pre
sumably needed no group discussion and,
therefore, were treated like all other old mem
bers of the Stanford Family.
Don is correct in much that he says if it is
taken to refer to late registrants. Faculty ad
visers are not relieved of their regular teaching
joads. Hence the late registrants, and there
were legions of them, had to hunt down the
advisers between classes. The advisers may
have appeared hurried or harried when con
tacted near class time, but surely they were
not disinterested.
ADVISERS WELL INFORMED
Perhaps a comment should be made on Don's
charge that the advisers were not properly in
formed. I can only say that they are all old

timers from the Lower Division Committee and
know well the Lower Division requirements
and offerings. It is true that through no fault
of theirs the publication of the Time Schedule
was delayed. It is also true that many sections
closed early and that some confusion followed.
These and other difficulties quite understand
ably kept the advisers from doing what they
consider really first-rate jobs.
Members of the Committee on Veterans'
Counseling do no academic advising for the
Upper Division students since this work is en
tirely in the hands of the schools and depart
ments. The committee members merely stand
by to aid through bull and gripe sessions in
the adjustments to Stanford life. Nor do the
veterans' advisers have a part in the prelimi
nary contacts the veterans make with Stanford.
These functions are in the hands of the regular
contact groups. Lower Division advisers take
over only after the student has been given his
big yellow record card.
SUGGESTIONS WELCOMED
In closing may I express my satisfaction that
the plans Don suggested for the Lower Division
advising of veterans were in such close agree
ment with the program previously adopted by
Stanford. The members of the committee hope
that they will be able to devise better methods
for handling of the late registrants and will
welcome any suggestions along this line.
Sincerely yours,
Paul R. Farnsworth
Sub-committee on Veterans' Counseling
To the Editor:
The only consoling statement found on the
"Open Letter from a Veteran" page in today's
Daily is the fact that the editor considers it to
be the attitude of "some Stanford veterans."
As a veteran of somewhat comparable serv
ice background to Don Allan, I'd like to stick
an. oar on the other side of the boat and do a
little pulling for Stanford.
GRIPES NOT APPRECIATED
All the gripes and "feeling sorry for one
self" that were contained in today's letter are
things most vets had hoped to have left be
hind when they received that little white paper
saying they were out and civilians once more.
There apparently seems to be one of us who
liked the regimentation of Army life enough to
want to see it continued here at Stanford. On
that score I'd like to know just where in the
Air Forces Don Allan ever saw the high state
of processing efficiency he speaks of so highly
as "the Army way." From where I sat I must
have missed it, since even the personnel who
gave us our final discharge orientation talks
at Camp Beale were far more confused and
less informed than anyone I have yet contacted
officially at Stanford.
REG DAY MINOR PROBLEM
To my observation, the faults of Registration
Day weren't hard especially lor the veterans. (If
my memory is correct, there were far more
freshmen and transfers standing in the line in
the Ad Building at 5 p.m. than there were vet
erans.) Most of the faults of registration lines
and mobs affect all members of the student
body and, as such, are a student body prob
lem to be approached by any interested veteran
as a member of the student body, and not as a
veteran.
From the veterans' viewpoint there might
have been a few more bumps smoothed out in
the Dean's and Registrar's offices prior to Reg
Day, but is the road to registration so easy for
the incoming frosh or transfer that the veteran
can consider himself discriminated against?
Speaking for myself, I found ample help and
advice in the Registrar's office and the ques
tions they couldn't answer were the same ones
that even the Army educational advisers could
n't just a week before. "The Dean's secreta
ries," too, can hardly be called inefficient since
this was the first large veterans' Reg Day.
RECONVERSION PLANS GOOD
Don Allan has made some good points that
the Administration may see fit to carry out.
However, as the "Educational Opportunities
for Veterans" pamphlet points out, most of them
have already been placed in the University's
plan to aid the returning veteran. The sudden
ness of the war's end and the immediate in
crease in the discharge rate are enough excuses
as to why the Universe couldn't put all of the
plans into effect. Even the Army wasn't God
gifted and perfect enough to foresee the im
mediate problems of reconversion that would
arise with the war's end.
All of the student veterans want to become
a part of the University's life, and I side with
that majority who don't want any special or
ganization or distinctions to mar that return
to a normal Stanford life. However, to prevent
any misunderstanding as to how the veterans

this was the first large veterans' Reg Day.
RECONVERSION PLANS GOOD
Don Allan has made some good points that
the Administration may see fit to carry out.
However, as the "Educational Opportunities
for Veterans" pamphlet points out, most of them
have already been placed in the University's
plan to aid the returning veteran. The sudden
ness of the war's end and the immediate in
crease in the discharge rate are enough excuses
as to why the Universe couldn't put all of the
plans into effect. Even the Army wasn't God
gifted and perfect enough to foresee the im
mediate problems of reconversion that would
arise with the war's end.
All of the student veterans want to become
a part of the University's life, and I side with
that majority who don't want any special or
ganization or distinctions to mar that return
to a normal Stanford life. However, to prevent
any misunderstanding as to how the veterans
feel, or what they expect, might it not be a good
idea to either get them together and let them
speak their mind, or poll them with a good
questionnaire and get a good cross-section of
their views, instead of letting individual "open
letters" speak for the entire group?
Yours truly,
Earl F. Schmidt. Jr.
Editor, Stanford Daily:
On behalf of the advisers for the Lower Divi
sion veterans, I would like to comment on a
part of the thought-provoking article Don Allan
sent to Friday's Daily. I desire particularly to
make clear that in so far as Don's gripes refer
to the Lower Division advising they apply al
most wholly to late registrants.
All Lower Division veterans who arrived at
Stanford in time for "New-Student Registration
Day"and who brought to their advisers proper
credentials were treated much as Don sug
gested. Each adviser met with his advisees as
a group for almost an hour, explained the de
tails of registration and the philosophy of the
Lower Division, and then interviewed each
advisee separately. Registration stopped offi
cially at 2:30 p.m. Some time ago the advisers
discussed Don's scheme of meeting students
in alphabetic order. This plan was discarded
as it seemed unfair to keep the Wings and the
Zings from favorite classes which close early.
So, instead, the order in which the students
were advised was chiefly by lot.
TREATED LIKE STANFORD FAMILY
Lower Division veterans who arrived on
Monday to resume their work at Stanford pre
sumably needed no group discussion and,
therefore, were treated like all other old mem
bers of the Stanford Family.
Don is correct in much that he says if it is
taken to refer to late registrants. Faculty ad
visers are not relieved of their regular teaching
joads. Hence the late registrants, and there
were legions of them, had to hunt down the
advisers between classes. The advisers may
have appeared hurried or harried when con
tacted near class time, but surely they were
not disinterested.
ADVISERS WELL INFORMED
Perhaps a comment should be made on Don's
charge that the advisers were not properly in
formed. I can only say that they are all old

timers from the Lower Division Committee and
know well the Lower Division requirements
and offerings. It is true that through no fault
of theirs the publication of the Time Schedule
was delayed. It is also true that many sections
closed early and that some confusion followed.
These and other difficulties quite understand
ably kept the advisers from doing what they
consider really first-rate jobs.
Members of the Committee on Veterans'
Counseling do no academic advising for the
Upper Division students since this work is en
tirely in the hands of the schools and depart
ments. The committee members merely stand
by to aid through bull and gripe sessions in
the adjustments to Stanford life. Nor do the
veterans' advisers have a part in the prelimi
nary contacts the veterans make with Stanford.
These functions are in the hands of the regular
contact groups. Lower Division advisers take
over only after the student has been given his
big yellow record card.
SUGGESTIONS WELCOMED
In closing may I express my satisfaction that
the plans Don suggested for the Lower Division
advising of veterans were in such close agree
ment with the program previously adopted by
Stanford. The members of the committee hope
that they will be able to devise better methods
for handling of the late registrants and will
welcome any suggestions along this line.
Sincerely yours,
Paul R. Farnsworth
Sub-committee on Veterans' Counseling
To the Editor:
The only consoling statement found on the
"Open Letter from a Veteran" page in today's
Daily is the fact that the editor considers it to
be the attitude of "some Stanford veterans."
As a veteran of somewhat comparable serv
ice background to Don Allan, I'd like to stick
an. oar on the other side of the boat and do a
little pulling for Stanford.
GRIPES NOT APPRECIATED
All the gripes and "feeling sorry for one
self" that were contained in today's letter are
things most vets had hoped to have left be
hind when they received that little white paper
saying they were out and civilians once more.
There apparently seems to be one of us who
liked the regimentation of Army life enough to
want to see it continued here at Stanford. On
that score I'd like to know just where in the
Air Forces Don Allan ever saw the high state
of processing efficiency he speaks of so highly
as "the Army way." From where I sat I must
have missed it, since even the personnel who
gave us our final discharge orientation talks
at Camp Beale were far more confused and
less informed than anyone I have yet contacted
officially at Stanford.
REG DAY MINOR PROBLEM
To my observation, the faults of Registration
Day weren't hard especially lor the veterans. (If
my memory is correct, there were far more
freshmen and transfers standing in the line in
the Ad Building at 5 p.m. than there were vet
erans.) Most of the faults of registration lines
and mobs affect all members of the student
body and, as such, are a student body prob
lem to be approached by any interested veteran
as a member of the student body, and not as a
veteran.
From the veterans' viewpoint there might
have been a few more bumps smoothed out in
the Dean's and Registrar's offices prior to Reg
Day, but is the road to registration so easy for
the incoming frosh or transfer that the veteran
can consider himself discriminated against?
Speaking for myself, I found ample help and
advice in the Registrar's office and the ques
tions they couldn't answer were the same ones
that even the Army educational advisers could
n't just a week before. "The Dean's secreta
ries," too, can hardly be called inefficient since
this was the first large veterans' Reg Day.

lem to be approached by any interested veteran
as a member of the student body, and not as a
veteran.
From the veterans' viewpoint there might
have been a few more bumps smoothed out in
the Dean's and Registrar's offices prior to Reg
Day, but is the road to registration so easy for
the incoming frosh or transfer that the veteran
can consider himself discriminated against?
Speaking for myself, I found ample help and
advice in the Registrar's office and the ques
tions they couldn't answer were the same ones
that even the Army educational advisers could
n't just a week before. "The Dean's secreta
ries," too, can hardly be called inefficient since
this was the first large veterans' Reg Day.
RECONVERSION PLANS GOOD
Don Allan has made some good points that
the Administration may see fit to carry out.
However, as the "Educational Opportunities
for Veterans" pamphlet points out, most of them
have already been placed in the University's
plan to aid the returning veteran. The sudden
ness of the war's end and the immediate in
crease in the discharge rate are enough excuses
as to why the Universe couldn't put all of the
plans into effect. Even the Army wasn't God
gifted and perfect enough to foresee the im
mediate problems of reconversion that would
arise with the war's end.
All of the student veterans want to become
a part of the University's life, and I side with
that majority who don't want any special or
ganization or distinctions to mar that return
to a normal Stanford life. However, to prevent
any misunderstanding as to how the veterans
feel, or what they expect, might it not be a good
idea to either get them together and let them
speak their mind, or poll them with a good
questionnaire and get a good cross-section of
their views, instead of letting individual "open
letters" speak for the entire group?

Editor, Stanford Daily:
On behalf of the advisers for the Lower Divi
sion veterans, I would like to comment on a
part of the thought-provoking article Don Allan
sent to Friday's Daily. I desire particularly to
make clear that in so far as Don's gripes refer
to the Lower Division advising they apply al
most wholly to late registrants.
All Lower Division veterans who arrived at
Stanford in time for "New-Student Registration
Day"and who brought to their advisers proper
credentials were treated much as Don sug
gested. Each adviser met with his advisees as
a group for almost an hour, explained the de
tails of registration and the philosophy of the
Lower Division, and then interviewed each
advisee separately. Registration stopped offi
cially at 2:30 p.m. Some time ago the advisers
discussed Don's scheme of meeting students
in alphabetic order. This plan was discarded
as it seemed unfair to keep the Wings and the
Zings from favorite classes which close early.
So, instead, the order in which the students
were advised was chiefly by lot.
TREATED LIKE STANFORD FAMILY
Lower Division veterans who arrived on
Monday to resume their work at Stanford pre
sumably needed no group discussion and,
therefore, were treated like all other old mem
bers of the Stanford Family.
Don is correct in much that he says if it is
taken to refer to late registrants. Faculty ad
visers are not relieved of their regular teaching
joads. Hence the late registrants, and there
were legions of them, had to hunt down the
advisers between classes. The advisers may
have appeared hurried or harried when con
tacted near class time, but surely they were
not disinterested.
ADVISERS WELL INFORMED
Perhaps a comment should be made on Don's
charge that the advisers were not properly in
formed. I can only say that they are all old

timers from the Lower Division Committee and
know well the Lower Division requirements
and offerings. It is true that through no fault
of theirs the publication of the Time Schedule
was delayed. It is also true that many sections
closed early and that some confusion followed.
These and other difficulties quite understand
ably kept the advisers from doing what they
consider really first-rate jobs.
Members of the Committee on Veterans'
Counseling do no academic advising for the
Upper Division students since this work is en
tirely in the hands of the schools and depart
ments. The committee members merely stand
by to aid through bull and gripe sessions in
the adjustments to Stanford life. Nor do the
veterans' advisers have a part in the prelimi
nary contacts the veterans make with Stanford.
These functions are in the hands of the regular
contact groups. Lower Division advisers take
over only after the student has been given his
big yellow record card.
SUGGESTIONS WELCOMED
In closing may I express my satisfaction that
the plans Don suggested for the Lower Division
advising of veterans were in such close agree
ment with the program previously adopted by
Stanford. The members of the committee hope
that they will be able to devise better methods
for handling of the late registrants and will
welcome any suggestions along this line.
Sincerely yours,
Paul R. Farnsworth
Sub-committee on Veterans' Counseling
To the Editor:
The only consoling statement found on the
"Open Letter from a Veteran" page in today's
Daily is the fact that the editor considers it to
be the attitude of "some Stanford veterans."
As a veteran of somewhat comparable serv
ice background to Don Allan, I'd like to stick
an. oar on the other side of the boat and do a
little pulling for Stanford.
GRIPES NOT APPRECIATED
All the gripes and "feeling sorry for one
self" that were contained in today's letter are
things most vets had hoped to have left be
hind when they received that little white paper
saying they were out and civilians once more.
There apparently seems to be one of us who
liked the regimentation of Army life enough to
want to see it continued here at Stanford. On
that score I'd like to know just where in the
Air Forces Don Allan ever saw the high state
of processing efficiency he speaks of so highly
as "the Army way." From where I sat I must
have missed it, since even the personnel who
gave us our final discharge orientation talks
at Camp Beale were far more confused and
less informed than anyone I have yet contacted
officially at Stanford.
REG DAY MINOR PROBLEM
To my observation, the faults of Registration
Day weren't hard especially lor the veterans. (If
my memory is correct, there were far more
freshmen and transfers standing in the line in
the Ad Building at 5 p.m. than there were vet
erans.) Most of the faults of registration lines
and mobs affect all members of the student
body and, as such, are a student body prob
lem to be approached by any interested veteran
as a member of the student body, and not as a
veteran.
From the veterans' viewpoint there might
have been a few more bumps smoothed out in
the Dean's and Registrar's offices prior to Reg
Day, but is the road to registration so easy for
the incoming frosh or transfer that the veteran
can consider himself discriminated against?
Speaking for myself, I found ample help and
advice in the Registrar's office and the ques
tions they couldn't answer were the same ones
that even the Army educational advisers could
n't just a week before. "The Dean's secreta
ries," too, can hardly be called inefficient since
this was the first large veterans' Reg Day.
RECONVERSION PLANS GOOD

the Administration may see fit to carry out.
