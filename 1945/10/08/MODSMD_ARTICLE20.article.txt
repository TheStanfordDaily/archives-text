# Tresidder Announces Farm Gifts Doubled
## $3,400,110 Received by University, Reversing Trend Toward Slump 
### 
Shaiply reversing the national
trend, gifts to Stanford University
during the fiscal year ending Au
gust more than doubled the prev
ious high mark to reach a total of

$3,400,110, President Donald B.
Tresidder announced Saturday.
This year's report is particularly
sginiilcant, said Dr. Tresidder, for
two reasons:
Donations Decrease Elsewhere
1) Gifts to colleges and universi
ties have declined steadily, annual
averages dropping from about 45
million dollars in the Twenties to
37 million in the Thirties to an
estimated 32 million so far in the
Forties. Meanwhile, Stanford gifts
set new records in 1938, 1941, and
MA2. The previous record, set in
1942, was $1,000,000.
2) Persons with a taxable income
of less than $5,000 are contributing
more and more to colleges and
universities. This year's Stanford
total came from 3,518 individual
donors.
Exceeded by Gifts
"However, while the number of
donors is steadily increasing, their
total contribution to Stanford is still
exceeded by gifts and bequests from
the wealthy," Dr. Tresidder said.
"Nearly two and three-quarter mil
lion dollars of this year's total came
from 12 donors, and a little less than
three-quarters of a million dol
lars c,4me from the other 3,506
donor?."
The Stanford Annual Appeal this
year drew $121,121 from 2,727 don
ors. This, like the total of gifts,
is twice as high as the previous rec
ord.
Half Unrestrcited
More than half of the annual total,
or $1,847,160, was included in un
restricted gifts for current use and
for endowment.
Scholarship, fellowship, and loan
funds received $416,522. The ad
dition to research funds was $174,-
580. University libraries, including
the Hoover Library, received $104,-
366.
The Stanford School of Medicine
led the schools of the University
with a total of $777,391. Second
was the School of Humanities with
$127,260, and the School of Engineer
ing was third with $97,122.

The Stanford School of Medicine
led the schools of the University
with a total of $777,391. Second
was the School of Humanities with
$127,260, and the School of Engineer
ing was third with $97,122.
Shaiply reversing the national
trend, gifts to Stanford University
during the fiscal year ending Au
gust more than doubled the prev
ious high mark to reach a total of

$3,400,110, President Donald B.
Tresidder announced Saturday.
This year's report is particularly
sginiilcant, said Dr. Tresidder, for
two reasons:
Donations Decrease Elsewhere
1) Gifts to colleges and universi
ties have declined steadily, annual
averages dropping from about 45
million dollars in the Twenties to
37 million in the Thirties to an
estimated 32 million so far in the
Forties. Meanwhile, Stanford gifts
set new records in 1938, 1941, and
MA2. The previous record, set in
1942, was $1,000,000.
2) Persons with a taxable income
of less than $5,000 are contributing
more and more to colleges and
universities. This year's Stanford
total came from 3,518 individual
donors.
Exceeded by Gifts
"However, while the number of
donors is steadily increasing, their
total contribution to Stanford is still
exceeded by gifts and bequests from
the wealthy," Dr. Tresidder said.
"Nearly two and three-quarter mil
lion dollars of this year's total came
from 12 donors, and a little less than
three-quarters of a million dol
lars c,4me from the other 3,506
donor?."
The Stanford Annual Appeal this
year drew $121,121 from 2,727 don
ors. This, like the total of gifts,
is twice as high as the previous rec
ord.
Half Unrestrcited
More than half of the annual total,
or $1,847,160, was included in un
restricted gifts for current use and
for endowment.
Scholarship, fellowship, and loan
funds received $416,522. The ad
dition to research funds was $174,-
580. University libraries, including
the Hoover Library, received $104,-
366.
