# Russia Needs More Books; Drive Begins
## 
### 
Books of permanent value are
needed to help restock the devas
tated libraries of the Soviet Union,
announced the "Books for Russia"
publicity office in Palo Alto recently.
President Donald B. Tresidder and
Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, president
of the University of California, have
been named co-chairmen of the
Northern California area for the
nation-wide drive.
In a statement to the Daily, Dr.
Tresidder said: "I am so glad to
know of the Stanford Daily's in
terest in the current Books for Rus
sia campaign and I am hopeful that
members of the Stanford community
will join with other Northern Cali
fornia's in giving full support to this
program.
Fill Ravaged Shelves
The purpose of this campaign is,
as you know, to help restock the
shelves in Russia's libraries de
stroyed by war. What is wanted are
English language books of perman
ent .value. This program offers more
than an opportunity to help re
store the cultural resources of the
Russian people; it provides also a
simple way for each one of us to
participate actively in strengthen
ing international understanding and
good will.
The Bookstore is one of the col
lecting depots for the "Books for
Russia" campaign in the Palo Alto
area. A box has been placed at the
end of the typewriter department
in the Bookstore to collect donations
from Stanford students and faculty
members, the Bookstore announced.
Stanford Sponsors
Six Stanford professors have been
named as sponsors for the Palo Alto
area during the drive which will
last through fall and wanter. They
are Dr. Roger Barker, Dr. Harold
H. Fisher, Dr. Henry Lanz, Dr. Al
bert Guerard, Dr. James Mcßain,
and Dr. Frank Weymouth.
"Libraries in the conquered areas
of the Soviet Union were a favorite
target of Nazi barbarity," stated Dr.
Harry B. Reynolds, chairman of the
Palo Alto "Books for Russia" com
mittee.
"It has been calculated that r>t
least 23 million volumes were stolen
or destroyed by the Germans in the
Russian Soviet Socialist Republic
alonfe, many of the books in English
which only the generosity of the
American people can immediately
replace.
English Texts Needed
"Since, moreover, the teaching of
English is expanding rapidly in the
Soviet Union —it has become a com
pulsory language in the secondary
schools of the large cities—the books
for which our committee appeals at
this time are all the more desper
ately needed," he said.
Scientific works and technical
books published since 1926 are de
sired, as well as "classics," the pub
licity office stated. Contributors are
asked to choose books which they
think the Russians would like to
read arid which best reflect and por
tray the American and British way
of life.
Donate Good Books
Unsuitable for the committee's
purposes are cheap novels, diction
aries, paper-bound volumes, text
books, translations, or books whose
content is purely propagandistic.
Depots have been established at
the South Palo Alto Branch Library,
the Palo Alto Community Center,
and the headquarters of Russian Re
lief at 540 Emerson Street. Arrange
ments for the picking up of large
donations of books can be made by
calling Russian Relief Headquarters,
P A. 2-5110.
