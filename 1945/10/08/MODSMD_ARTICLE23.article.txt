# Buses Tie Up; Strikes Ease
## 
### United Press 
While the back-to-work move
ment continued in Navy-seized Cal
ifornia oil plants, strikes continued
to tie up bus traffic in seven West
ern states; 61,000 workers were idle
in a five-state lumber mill shut
down, and a machinists' walkout
was threatened in San Francisco.
On most Pacific Coast labor
fronts, the situation was virtually
unchanged over the week-end. A
movie industry strike continued in
Southern California. At Vallejo,
Calif., 7 stores appeared likely to
remain closed unless the AFL Retail
Store Clerks' Union, Local 373, can
settle a dispute over a WLB order
increasing the minimum wage from
$18.50 to $24 weekly.
In San Francisco late today, AFL
Machinists' Union No. 68, holding a
5,000-member mass meeting, voted
to strike "on or before Oct. 29" if
their wage demands are not met.
The union claims to have juris
diction over 3,500 local machinists
and 10,000 more working in ship
yards.
They are demanding a 30 per cent
wage increase, which would raise
the rate for journeymen from $1.28
to $1.65 per hour.
No settlement was in sight be
tween the Greyhound bus lines and
the Amalgamated Association of
Street Car, Electric Railway and
Motor Coach Employees, AFL. The
strike is in its third day, and in
volves approximately 2,700 drivers
and station employees.
