## Tigers Top Cubs, Lead Series 3-2 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 7 (UP). — Hal
Newhouser, backed by an explo
sive blast of American League pow
er, redeemed himself today when
he pitched the Detroit Tigers to an
8 to 4 victory over the Chicago
Cubs in the fifth game of the World
Series.
Coming through to put the Ti
gers ahead, three games to two, the
major leagues' leading winner con
quered Hank Borowy, who had
beaten him in the first game. It
was vindication for the lean De
troit star —and it came in one of the
wildest and screwiest contests in
series history.
Almost everything which could
possibly happen in a ball game hap
pened out here in the sunshine at
Wrigley Field. Two men tripped
and fell running the base paths, the
Cubs contributed two errors, there
were arguments and involved plays,
a batter was hit by a pitched ball,

j 10 men batted in one Tiger inning,
' there was a parade of pitehers and
pinch-hitters—and a ball was lost
i by an outfielder in the ivy growing
j on the center field wall.
Big Hal allowed seven hits but
I many of them were tainted ones,
and after a big sixth inning in
which his mates got him four runs
and blasted Borowy out of the box
there was little question that the
southpaw, who led the majors this
season with 25 victories, was going
to take this one.
It was a heart-warming inning
for those Tigers when they saw Bo
rowy trudge to the showers. For
the lean-faced Polish boy from New
Jersey had given them plenty of
lumps before the American League
waived him away and the Cubs
purchased him in mid-season this
year as pennant insurance for $100,-
000.
Borowy had knocked these Tigers

down 11 times against only three
losses. And it was he who white
washed them with a 9 to 0 shutout
in the first game of the series at
Detroit.
For the sixth game tomorrow, it
will be Virgil Trucks for the Tigers
and the veteran Claude Passeau
for the Cubs.
"Virgil will wind this up for us,"
O'Neill and in the jubilant Tiger
clubhouse after the game. "Pas
seau won't get past us again."

AFTER BEIN(i DRIVEN from the moumi in the World Series opener,
Tiger ace Hal Newhouser bested Hank Borowy who opposed him in
the series initial contest when the Bengals piled up a total of 13 hits
to cop the filth game of the classic 8-4 Sunday.
CHICAGO, Oct. 7 (UP). — Hal
Newhouser, backed by an explo
sive blast of American League pow
er, redeemed himself today when
he pitched the Detroit Tigers to an
8 to 4 victory over the Chicago
Cubs in the fifth game of the World
Series.
Coming through to put the Ti
gers ahead, three games to two, the
major leagues' leading winner con
quered Hank Borowy, who had
beaten him in the first game. It
was vindication for the lean De
troit star —and it came in one of the
wildest and screwiest contests in
series history.
Almost everything which could
possibly happen in a ball game hap
pened out here in the sunshine at
Wrigley Field. Two men tripped
and fell running the base paths, the
Cubs contributed two errors, there
were arguments and involved plays,
a batter was hit by a pitched ball,
