# Bears Defeat Huskies; Troy In Third Win
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7 (UP).—
The University of Southern Cali
fornia's Trojans have won three
straight victories—two of them Pa
cific Coast Conference tilts — but
dont put the Jeff Cravath crew in
the Rose Bowl yet.
Coach Buck Shaw and his Univer
sity of California Bears still hope
to have something to say about that.
The Bears, who trounced the Uni
versity of Washington in Berkeley
yesterday, 27-14, already have lost
once to the men of Troy. But it was
with a different lineup than the
one now used by Shaw yesterday.
Stanford's Agncw Stars
The Huskies of Seattle had come
to Berkeley with a 20-6 victory over
Oregon under their belts and should
have been considered the favorites
over the twice-defeated Bears. But
a couple of new lads, just back
lrom the wars, Billy Agnew, ex-
Stanford student, and Bud Buestad,
made the difference.
However, while. California was
improving at the expense of Wash
ington, the Trojans showed no let
down. Thej' ran rough-shod over
a supposedly good St. Mary's Pre-
Flight squad by a 26-14 score. The
Air Devils weren't allowed to use
their professional stars, but still the
Trojans continued to show an im
proved brand of play that spelled
no good for future rivals.
W.S.C. Crushes O.S.C.
Up north, the University of Ore
gon, with Jake Leicht in the line
up, trounced little Idaho, 33-7, as
expected and the Washington State
Cougars' "T" exploded on Oregon
State, 33-0. Leicht, former Pasa
dena J.C. star and later with the
Fourth Air Force, was the big gun
in the Webfoot attack and the
chances are Oregon will be tough
in the future.
Coach Phil Sorboe used four
backfields aaginst Oregon State, and
still his Cougars were able to score
—apparently at will.
Small College Scores
Fresno State, which appears to
be a power among the smaller
schools, ground out a 19-0 win over
Ariona State; Redlands defeated
Occidental, 39-0. and Compton Jun
ior College deadlocked with Pomona
J.C. in a wild-scoring game, 34-34.
In the Rocky Mountain area, Col
orado hurled Utah, 18-13; Ft. War
ren blasted Colorado A. and M.,
60-7, and Colorado College trimmed
Herrington Field, 43-6.

with a different lineup than the
one now used by Shaw yesterday.
Stanford's Agncw Stars
The Huskies of Seattle had come
to Berkeley with a 20-6 victory over
Oregon under their belts and should
have been considered the favorites
over the twice-defeated Bears. But
a couple of new lads, just back
lrom the wars, Billy Agnew, ex-
Stanford student, and Bud Buestad,
made the difference.
However, while. California was
improving at the expense of Wash
ington, the Trojans showed no let
down. Thej' ran rough-shod over
a supposedly good St. Mary's Pre-
Flight squad by a 26-14 score. The
Air Devils weren't allowed to use
their professional stars, but still the
Trojans continued to show an im
proved brand of play that spelled
no good for future rivals.
W.S.C. Crushes O.S.C.
Up north, the University of Ore
gon, with Jake Leicht in the line
up, trounced little Idaho, 33-7, as
expected and the Washington State
Cougars' "T" exploded on Oregon
State, 33-0. Leicht, former Pasa
dena J.C. star and later with the
Fourth Air Force, was the big gun
in the Webfoot attack and the
chances are Oregon will be tough
in the future.
Coach Phil Sorboe used four
backfields aaginst Oregon State, and
still his Cougars were able to score
—apparently at will.
Small College Scores
Fresno State, which appears to
be a power among the smaller
schools, ground out a 19-0 win over
Ariona State; Redlands defeated
Occidental, 39-0. and Compton Jun
ior College deadlocked with Pomona
J.C. in a wild-scoring game, 34-34.
In the Rocky Mountain area, Col
orado hurled Utah, 18-13; Ft. War
ren blasted Colorado A. and M.,
60-7, and Colorado College trimmed
Herrington Field, 43-6.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7 (UP).—
The University of Southern Cali
fornia's Trojans have won three
straight victories—two of them Pa
cific Coast Conference tilts — but
dont put the Jeff Cravath crew in
the Rose Bowl yet.
Coach Buck Shaw and his Univer
sity of California Bears still hope
to have something to say about that.
The Bears, who trounced the Uni
versity of Washington in Berkeley
yesterday, 27-14, already have lost
once to the men of Troy. But it was
with a different lineup than the
one now used by Shaw yesterday.
