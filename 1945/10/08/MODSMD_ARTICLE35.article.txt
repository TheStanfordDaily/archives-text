# Michigan, Penn Face Tough Jobs
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.—(UP).—
Michigan and Penn State faced the
bleakest immediate futures of any
collegt football teams today.
Both won gratifying victories last
Saturday—Michigan took a 20 to 7
Big Ten decision over Northwestern
and Penn State upset Colgate, 27 to
7—but past victories were expected
to be of little help when Michigan
takes the field against Army at New
York next Saturday and Penn State
faces Navy.
Army and Navy, ranked one-two
in college football last season,
proved Saturday that they still are
out of the class of the ordinary
college team in 1945. Army toyed
with Wake Forest, a team which
had proved itself among the better
college elevens, and cut the last
quarter down to 10 minutes as it
ran up a 54 to 0 score. Navy blasted
through Duke for a 21 to 0 win—
and Duke rates among the best in
its class.
Michigan, its Big Ten hopes jolted
by Indiana's win two weeks ago,
showed vast improvement in top
ping an underrated Northwestern
team, but not enough improvement
to give it hopes against Army.
