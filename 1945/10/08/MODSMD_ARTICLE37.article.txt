CLEVELAND, 0„ Oct. 7 (UP).—
The Cleveland Rams, living up to
their play in exhibition games, de
feated the Chicago Bears, 17 to 0,
before 19,580 paying customers in a
National Football League game here
today.
Playing in ideal weather, the
Bears threatened the Rams' goal
three times but were held each
time. Passes by Luckman through
out the ie were for the most part
incomplc V.
The first Bear fumble came on
the first running play of the game,
and the Rams recovered. Running
plays moved the ball to the Bear
eight-yard line, and Bob Water
field, former U.C.L.A. player, cir
cled end to score. Waterfield place
kicked the extra point.
Chicago moved the ball to its own
48 after the kickofF where Hugh
Gallarneau, former Stanford star,
fumbled and Ralph Ruthstrom re
covered for the Rams on the Cleve
land 45. A running play oved the
ball to the Bears' 38 and two Water
field passes—to Hickey on the 25
and to end Steve Pritko for the
touchdown — made it 13-0. Again
Waterfield converted.
Cleveland controlled the ball in
Bear territory through most of the
second half, but could not muster a
scoring punch.
