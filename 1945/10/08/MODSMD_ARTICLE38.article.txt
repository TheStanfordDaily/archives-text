# Upsets Down Daily Pickers
## 
### 
Wc thought our experts were
pretty pood, but upsets all over the
nation this week made the average
of the slicker pickers gasp for breath.
Bob Gilkey ,who recently returned
to our sports staff after an absence
of a quarter, topped the iist with a
lowly 75 percent average when he
missed six out of the twenty games
the Daily staff predicted on. A 1
Sciaroni tied Gilkcv when he too
missed six. Levinson and Slobe fol
lowed behind with 71 and Welter
was on the bottom with G7. This
makes Sciaroni high with an aver
age of 84 percent over a period of
two weeks.
All five of our select selectors
slipped up on the Arkansas vs.
TCU. Harvard vs. Tufts. Texas A &
M vs. Oklahoma, and Great Lakes
vs. Fort Benning games because we
all, of course, picked the wrong
team. Occasional invectives and
threats are still prevalent around
the Daily sports office because of
the incorrectness of pre-season dope
and pet hunches to pay off. Armor
plate now lines the Daily hide
away's walls for protection from
those foolish enough to "take ad
vantage" of the Daily's selections.
Take it from us—lt doesn't pay.
—Slobe and Welter.
