Led by the unstoppable Herman
Wedemeyer, the sensational triple
threat back, the light but fast St.
Mary's Gaels pushed an overrated
Nevada club all over the field today
and after scoring three touchdowns
in the first 20 minutes of play,
romped to a 39-0 victory.
Coach Jimmy Phelan's boys, as
tricky as the grid master himself,
scored the first touchdown with the
game but two plays old. Their di
versified attack throughout was able
to score at will.
The Wolf Pack was forced to kick
after failing to make yardage after
the kick-off, St. Mary's taking over
on their own 25.
Wedemeyer made two on a line
plunge , then the Honolulu star
stepped back to forward pass to end
Bob Ryan. Ryan lateraled to quar
terback Dennis 'Connor, who tossed
the ball into the waiting arms of
Charles (Spike) Cordeiro. He raced
55 yards to score without a Ne
vadan touching him.
Despite the fine defensive work
by McClure and offensive duty by
giant end Max Dodge, Nevada never
got inside the St. Mary's 31. The
visitors picked up nine first downs
to 15 for St. Mary's.
The Gaels gained 233 yards from
rushing to 79 for Nevada and col
lected 222 yards in the air to 129
