# Bailey Outlines Peace of 1919
## Wilson Had to Fight Nationalism In U.S. and Europe after Last War 
### MARION MORROW 
"The greatest parallel between the
lost peace of the last war and the
present peace attempts is the post
war preoccupation of the people
with strikes, world series, Dick
Tracy, and a general apathetic at
titude," said Thomas A. Bailey, pro
fessor of history at Stanford in a
recent Daily interview.
Dr. Bailey has written "Woodrow
Wilson and the Lost Peace," and
"Woodrow Wilson and the Great Be
trayal"; the former book concern

ing the "peacemaking" of World
War I, won the Commonwealth Club
Gold Medal for 1944.
1919 Important Now
"Woodrow Wilson and the Great
Betrayal" has been hailed by the
critics as an extremely competent,
often dramatic, analysis of the many j
complex causes of Wilson's failure I
after his return from Paris. Wilson
returned from Paris after having
fought nationalism there, only to
find himself fighting it at home, in
a setting not so different from to
day. The years 1919 and 1920 hold
great meaning now when the United
States again have pledges to ful
fill to Europe.
The cost of living when Wilson
returned was very high; there was
unemployment, German - American
and other national groups were op
posed to the president; Hearst's and
other newspapers were very much
against him; many Republicans
cherished a blind hatred of him; the
League of Nations was "variously
denounced as a superstate or a sew
ing circle."
Republican Congress
The Republicans had leadership
in congress while the Democrats
lacked it; Henry Cabot Lodge, chair
man of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, chose men to suit his taste;
Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mel
lon furnished funds for anti-treaty
propaganda.
This situation culminated in the
refusal of Congress to ratify the
League treaty without Lodge's four
teen reservations, and a sick and
tired Wilson's refusal to approve the
"offensive but innocuous," us Dr.
Bailey terms it, fourteen reserva
tions.
No Peace Treaties Yet
A comparison may be drawn to
the present peace plans, since as so
many people fail to realize, the
United Nations Charter has been
ratified but there have been no ac
tual peace treaties ratified.
"The real fight," says Dr. Bailey, i
"is yel to come. The United Nations i
Charter was passed by the Senate
under a tidal wave of public opinion
so strong that Congress didn't dare
oppose it.
"Real Fight To Come"
"The real fight is going to come
in passing the actual peace treat
ies and in authorizing power to the
member of the Security Council to
emploj the armed forces of the
United States.
"The Senate could still hamstring
the charter by debating action too j
long in an emergency. When troops â– 
are needed, they are needed quick- j

ly. And the Senate could reject any
one of the separate peace treaties."
Lack of Interest
The problem, as Dr. Bailey sees
it, is no longer isolationism versus
internationalism, but mild interna
tionalism versus strong internation
alism. He had thought the atomic
bomb would do a great deal to allay
isolationalism, but the people have
become ingrown and self-centered,
and appear to lack interest in see
ing the peace through to a success
ful conclusion.
"The most encouraging sign so
far," continued Dr. Bailey, "is the
recent treaty between Russia and
China. We had assumed that Rus
sia would first, walk into Man
churai; and second, support the
Chinese Communists. Actually, Rus
sia has relinquished any claimed
hold over Manchuria with the ex
ception, of course, of Port Arthur
and the railroads, and has recog
nized the Nationalist government of
Chiang Kai-shek."
People More Realistic
Dr. Bailey believes that the peace
might very well fail unless people
become more interested, although
he thinks that at least people are
more realistic this time than last
in believing that perhaps there will
be another war in 20 to 50 years.
Dr. Bailey has been a member of
the history department at Stanford
since 1930. Prior to and during that
time he has been a member of the
Institute for Advanced Study,
Princeton, New Jersey; a Fellow in
International Relations of the Rocke
feller Foundation; an Albert Shaw
lecturer on diplomatic history at
the Johns Hopkins University; and
a visiting lecturer on history at
Harvard University. He was gradu
ated and received his A.M. and
Ph.D. from Stanford.
