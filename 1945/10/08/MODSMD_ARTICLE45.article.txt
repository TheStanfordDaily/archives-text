# Congress Agenda: Taxes, Atom Bombs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (UP). —
Taxes and atomic energy get the
congressional spotlight this week.
House debate begins Thursday on
a bill that would mean a 10 per cent
saving for all individual taxpayers.
It also would reduce corporate tax
liability by half, end the $5 auto
mobile use tax and freeze social
security payroll taxes at one per
cent for another year. All this
would cost the Treasury about $5,-
300,000,000 in 1946 revenue.
The House Military Affairs Com
mittee turns Thursday to a bill car
rying out President Truman's top
priority request for a commission to
control the use and development of
atomic energy. A companion Sen
ate bill is stymied temporarily be
cause of a dispute over which com
mittee should handle it.
The tax bill was approved by the
House Ways and Means Committee
last week. It is intended as a trans
itional measure to serve until
enough of the war's cost is paid to
permit greater reductions.
