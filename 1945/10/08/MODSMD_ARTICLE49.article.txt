### GEORGE BRUNN 
"One Nation," by Wallace Steg
ner and the editors of "Look,"
Houghton Mifflin Company, The
Riverside Press,
There are some things we Ameri
cans are not eager to talk about be
fore other people. When they ask
us, for instance, how we square our
much-vaunted "American Way of
Life" we cannot give them an in
telligent answer. Some of us will
admit that we are ashamed, some
of us will say "something ought to
be done about it,"and others will
defend intolerance with such stand
ard phrases as "the nigger must be
kept in his place" or "the Jews are
running the country."
Most of us know very little about
group-hatred and group-suspicion.
It has always been here, we have
grown up with it, many of us have
accepted it in the unquestioning
way in which only irrational be
lief are accepted.
Criticize Own Society
Nevertheless there has been a
great deal of criticism of our society.
It has come from economists, soci
ologists, novelists, radicals, psychol
ogists, and, in general, from people
sufficiently honest to realize that
diseases cannot be cured by avoiding
cognizance of their existence. Criti
cism has ranged from Lewis' satire
to Wylie's anger, from the sociolo
gical novel to the oratorical pamph
let.
Wallace Stegner—recent newcomer
to the Stanford English Department
—is, in "One Nation," critical only
by implication. He is primarily
analytical. This does not mean he
is cold, dry and text-bookish. Mr.
Stegnei is a writer, a writer of
imagination and ability, and more
over a writer who is wide awake.
Return of Japs
"In Santa Barbara, California, a
cigar store owner was opening his
shutters. The morning fog still lay
over the street, and the sound of
bells from the Mission came through
it soli and mellow. The cigar store
man yawned and glanced at the
morning headlines. 'Mixed reaction
to return of Japanese to Coast,' one
of them said. 'Governor's statement
urges Californians to make no dem
onstration against army order re
opening coastal area to loyal Japs.'
"A man with a large Manila en
velope came down the street, a little
man with a bouncy stride. He stop
ped at the door.
" 'Hi George,' he said."
" 'Hi' said the cigar man."
Ground to Cover
" 'Got to hustle,' the little man
said. 'Got a lot of ground to cover.
Just wanted to give you one of
these'."
He unwound the string from the
envelope's catches and pulled out. a

cardboard window sign. NO JAPS
ALLOWED, it said. 'Want you to
stick in your window,' the little
man said.
"The cigar man took it. 'Hell, yes,'
he said. 'First thing you know those
yellow bastards would be coming
in here expecting me to sell cig
aretts to 'em'."
"'Swell,' the little man said. 'Well,
I got to hustle. Happy New Year,
George'."
Group Prejudice
Mr. Stegner presents a case history
of group prejudice in the different
parts of the country—prejudice
against Japanese, Negroes, Hispan
os, Mexicans, Catholics, Jews, Fili
pinos, Chinese, Pachucos, and In
dians. In a calm and simple style,
supplemented by excellent photo
graphs, he takes each group and
determines the causes of prejudice
against them, the forms it takes, the
effects it has on the group and on
the nation, and the steps, if any,
that are being taken to alleviate it.
No Screaming
There is no screaming or implor
ing on Mr. Stegner's part. He lets
us look at the record. And from the
record it becames clear that it is
we who have to pay the high costs
of our prejudices. We pay for the
high disease rates of racial slums.
Perhaps not directly, but we pay for
it through the lowered productivity
of undernourished and demoralized
workers, through crime and vice and
through race riots.
We pay for intolerance by under
mining the foundations of demo
cratic existence: "When a Negro is
lynched in Mississippi or killed in
a riot in Detroit or in Beaumont,
Texas; when Mexican youths are
hunted down and beaten in Los
Angeles; when Japanese are shot at
in California; when Jewish children
are beaten in Boston and the Bronx
and Philadelphia, we are not deal
ing with isolated and local situa
itons, or even primarily with a na
tional situation.
Began in Germany
"What began in Germany with
the desecration of Jewish cemeter
ies in Munich and the mouthings
of petty politicians ended with the
extei niination camps of Poland.
Things we have permitted have a
clear relationship with Nazi prac
tices; the difference is only a differ
ence in degree."
Mr Stegner has done a good job,
and in the hands of the young,
whose minds are still free from
hatred—for it is not something in
herent —books like this will be ef
fective. As regards adults, those
who are intolerant and read it are
likely to remain intolerant for noth
ing is harder than to combat un
reason with reason.
