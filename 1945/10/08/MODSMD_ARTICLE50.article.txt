# More Federal Controls on Business, Higher Taxes Seen by Theodore Kreps
## 
### GEORGE BRUNN 
Increasing government regulation
of business and a need for hifiher
taxes in the upper income brackets
are seen by Theodore J. Kreps, Pro
fessor of Business Economics, who
recently returned to the campus af
ter more than three years of work
in Washington.
Although this may sound un
pleasant to many business men, he
believes that it will benefit indus
try in the long run. Business could
handle its affairs by itself, but it
won't. It is similar to men who
could take care of their hysical
welfare without physicians but gen
erally don't.
Slocks High
Professor Kreps explained his
controversial ideas on taxation by
pointing out that government debts
are approaching three hundred bil
lion dollars and vast funds of savers
are available. A large proportion
of these funds are now being spent
for stocks, real estate and specula
tion on the comodity market, with
the result that stocks are higher
than at any time during the last
eight years, real estate is skyrock
eting and the general rice level ris
ing in spite of price controls.
("These controls are like the cover
on a tea kettle and will only stand
so much pressure.") There is seri
ous danger that this will lead to
inflation.
Important Problems
The public debt, the budget and
the threat of inflation are grouped
by Professor Kreps under public
finance and constitute the first of
the two most irnortant problems of
our American economy. The second
is employment, which must be kept
high to maintain our standard of
living and avoid depression.
"Employment depends on the
physical volume of production,"
Professor Kreps maintains. "Except
for short periods of time, the
amount produced depends on the
demand for goods and services by
consumers, producers and the gov
ernment. Strategically and criti
cally the most important so far as
variations in employment are con
cerned is investment demand. Much
to be preferred is investment by
private individuals or businessmen,
investment induced by expectation
of making a profit. To be used only
if absolutely necessary is invest
ment on the part of the govern
ment."
For Job Increase
To maintain full employment—
that means about forty-five million
jobs by 1947 and an annual increase
of half a million thereafter—he con
siders three requirements essential.
First, competitive enterprise and
especially small-scale business must
be given the maximum opportunity
for rapid growth. "That method of
getting goods should be allowed to
operate which provides the best
product at the lowest cost consist
ent with maximum real social in
come."
Economic Actions
Action to realize this requirement
would include international cur
rency stabiliation, maximum reduc
tion of international trade barriers,
elimination of interstate barriers,
establishment of an employment -
stimulating tax system, and vigor
ous enforcement of anti-monopoly
and other consumer - protecting
measures.
Secondly, industry and the gov
ernment must "place a door under
consumer demand. In private and
public lants there must be co-oper
ation in implementation of a 'fu 11 -
employment program' by such de
vices as expanding vocational and
educational programs, providing ex
tensive social insurance, and ade
quate housing."
Public Works
Finally, the government must
have ready for use during periods
when unemployment reaches four
million a flexible rogram of public
works large enough "to keep to a
minimum the great wastages of hu
man and natural resources inflicted
by such depressions."

Public works alone, however, may
not be sufficient to alleviate de
pressions, Professor Kreps believes.
During the early thirties, he points
out, the amount of money
from them—money to stimulate de
mand and business—was from four
to five billion dollars.
Withholding Tax
Our withholding tax has much,
better "leverage." When deression
threatens it would take only an act
of Congress to cancel this tax, thus
providing from fifteen to nineteen
billion dollars to be spent on goods.
Not only would this provide more
money than public works, but it
would also avoid their waste and
inefficiency and minimize govern
ment interference.
In conclusion he pointed out that
the atomic bomb has made ours

"one world more than ever before.
Events in the most remote cornets
of the globe have become of im
portance to us. No longer can we
afford to act on our own.
