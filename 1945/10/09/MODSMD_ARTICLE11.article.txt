# New Rally Group Meets Cardinals
## Committee To Get Into Full Swing For Basketball 
### 
Patty Whittemore and Eugene
Mitguard, co-chairmen of the newly
reorganized Rally Committee, will
meet with Cardinals tonight to form
policies for this year's Rally Com
mittee.

Among the subjects to be discussed
are the number of students that will
be taken on the committee and the
requirements of the members. Ac
cording to Cardinals President Joan
McDonoUgh, Rally Committee mem
bership will be limited to a small
number this year because of the lack
of athletic activities. However, the
committee will gradually increase to
its pre-war size.
Two Groups Cooperate
The Rally Committee works in
conjunction with Cardinals and all
its plans and members must be ap
proved by that group. Pat Whitte
more states that the Rally Com will
try to obtain its former office in the
old Union,
Before the committee was dis
banded in 1943 becausc of the lack
of activities, students were chosen
for membership by an interview
with the Rally Com chairmen and
Cardinals president. After tonight's
meeting, more information will be
given about tryoutees and their re
quirements.
Anxious to Organize
The Rally Committee colchairmcn
arc anxious to reorganize the group
as soon as possible. They hope for
a great showing of interest and en
thusiasm by Stanford students.
Although the Farm's football fu
ture for 1945 is uncertain, the com
mittee wants to be prepared for the
basketball season and other post
war activities that will appear again
this year. More definite announce
ments will be made soon, according
to Patty Whittemore.
Committee Activc Before War
The committee, backed by Card
inals, was an important part of stu
dent activity before 1943. It handled
various student drives as well as
athletic stunts. The reorganizers of
the group want newcomers to the
Farm to back the committee and
help it to reach its former import
ance in Stanford life. Rally Com
will be essential in building up the
Farm's pre-war spirit and unity in
backing all activities.
