# Tresidder Faces Future With Stanford Veterans
## Landmarks Ahead: Simplified Reg Day, Adequate Housing, Smaller Enrollment 
### 
■ Complaints of inadequate University preparation for returning veterans
raised in a letter by Don Allan in Friday's Daily were answered last night
by the Stanford Veteran's Committee in an open, two-hour meeting in
the Education Building.
In a surprise visit, Stanford President Donald B. Tresidder, addressing

the group informally on housing
problems, said, "Stanford has a deep
appreciation of the problems of the
Veterans, and will give them every
consideration within our means."
Faculty Predicts
Predictions by the dozen faculty
men present were (1) really suffi
cient housing would not be forthcom
ing for some time to come (2) Peg
Day procedure will be streamlined
(3) better counseling will be pro
vided to both veterans and new stu
dents as well as others (4) a re
stricted admission program with
stiffer competitive basis will be
necessary to admit only those men
for whom the University has space.
The latter will be a program similar
to that which permitted only 350
girls to enter this fall from over
800 that applied.
Dr. Tresidder explained that the
University administration has been
exhausting every source in quest
of living space. Both the Navy and
San Francisco Housing Authority
were unable to suggest a solution.
Quonset huts and other temporary
housing units are not available at
present.
Live Aboard Ship?
The President said he had even
investigated the possibility of bring
ing ships from San Francisco and
anchoring them in the waters ad
jacent to Palo Alto, but the bay
proved too shallow.
Registrar Donald B. Winbigler
said that although cutting and
streamlining is under way in reg
procedure, it will always be some
what of a burden. Students last
night suggested that handbills giv
ing complete registration informa
tion supplementing instructions in
the reg books be distributed. Also,
committee members felt that older
students should be on hand to act
as guides to new students and vet
erans on Reg Day.
Building Tie-up
University funds — being trust
funds—cannot be used for housing,
said Dr. Tresidder, because they
must represent a capital investment
that will be income-producing. Even
if gift funds were available for dor
mitory allotment, it is extremely
doubtful whether they could be
completed by fall of next year be
cause of labor and material short
ages still critical.
Stanford has an expert investigat
ing other housing facilities through
out the country before the Univer
sity goes ahead with definite plans
for additional dormitory construc
tion. Dr. Tresidder admitted some
defects in the basic operation at
Stanford, but hoped that students
may be able to sec marked improve
ment soon.
The faculty staff present agreed
that registration this fall "was a
mess." It was attributed to short
age of help, no advance notice, the
war's sudden termination, plus the
addition of quantities of "paper
work" included in the G.I. Bill of
Rights.
Prof. B. F. McFadon of the Ac
counting Department was concerned
that a possible 1000 returning vet
erans at Stanford before the year's
end may cause a critical problem
for University accounting, since all
veterans must be carried on the
books. Even the Stanford Bookstore
must operate on a credit basis un
der the new G.I. provisions.

for additional dormitory construc
tion. Dr. Tresidder admitted some
defects in the basic operation at
Stanford, but hoped that students
may be able to sec marked improve
ment soon.
The faculty staff present agreed
that registration this fall "was a
mess." It was attributed to short
age of help, no advance notice, the
war's sudden termination, plus the
addition of quantities of "paper
work" included in the G.I. Bill of
Rights.
Prof. B. F. McFadon of the Ac
counting Department was concerned
that a possible 1000 returning vet
erans at Stanford before the year's
end may cause a critical problem
for University accounting, since all
veterans must be carried on the
books. Even the Stanford Bookstore
must operate on a credit basis un
der the new G.I. provisions.
■ Complaints of inadequate University preparation for returning veterans
raised in a letter by Don Allan in Friday's Daily were answered last night
by the Stanford Veteran's Committee in an open, two-hour meeting in
the Education Building.
In a surprise visit, Stanford President Donald B. Tresidder, addressing

the group informally on housing
problems, said, "Stanford has a deep
appreciation of the problems of the
Veterans, and will give them every
consideration within our means."
Faculty Predicts
Predictions by the dozen faculty
men present were (1) really suffi
cient housing would not be forthcom
ing for some time to come (2) Peg
Day procedure will be streamlined
(3) better counseling will be pro
vided to both veterans and new stu
dents as well as others (4) a re
stricted admission program with
stiffer competitive basis will be
necessary to admit only those men
for whom the University has space.
The latter will be a program similar
to that which permitted only 350
girls to enter this fall from over
800 that applied.
Dr. Tresidder explained that the
University administration has been
exhausting every source in quest
of living space. Both the Navy and
San Francisco Housing Authority
were unable to suggest a solution.
Quonset huts and other temporary
housing units are not available at
present.
Live Aboard Ship?
The President said he had even
investigated the possibility of bring
ing ships from San Francisco and
anchoring them in the waters ad
jacent to Palo Alto, but the bay
proved too shallow.
Registrar Donald B. Winbigler
said that although cutting and
streamlining is under way in reg
procedure, it will always be some
what of a burden. Students last
night suggested that handbills giv
ing complete registration informa
tion supplementing instructions in
the reg books be distributed. Also,
committee members felt that older
students should be on hand to act
as guides to new students and vet
erans on Reg Day.
Building Tie-up
University funds — being trust
funds—cannot be used for housing,
said Dr. Tresidder, because they
must represent a capital investment
that will be income-producing. Even
if gift funds were available for dor
mitory allotment, it is extremely
doubtful whether they could be
completed by fall of next year be
cause of labor and material short
ages still critical.

ing other housing facilities through
out the country before the Univer
sity goes ahead with definite plans
for additional dormitory construc
tion. Dr. Tresidder admitted some
