EXPERIMENT PROGRESSING
Stanford's experiment in student govern
ment the area representation plan under which
this year's Excom was elected—received an
other boost through its trial period yesterday
when Women's Conference moved to form a
Row Excom, a committee composed of repre
sentatives from each women's residence on the
Row. The Row Excom (which, incidentally,
was proposed and tried last spring guarter in
relation to the housing program) will send a
representative to Nominating and Sponsor-
Choosing Committees; its president will be a
member of Women's Conference; and, in what
may prove to be its most important function, it
will be in direct contact with the A.S.S.U. Excom
jf presentative from the How, who will be in
vited to attend all meetings.
Large residences, such as Lagunita, have
long established Excoms through which their
A.S.S.U. Excom representatives may gauge stu
dent opinion. The problem, however, of how
the Excom representative from the men's Row
district can discover his constituents' opinions
is still open for action.
