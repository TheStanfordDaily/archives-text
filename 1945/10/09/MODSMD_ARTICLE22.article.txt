### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Shidehora, who fought the militarists so hard dur
ing their early rise to power in Japan, has returned
to power. Iligashi-Kuhni, the militarist premier of
a nation that we were supposed to be physically and
ink llectually demilitarizing, is out.
The new premier is an old-line Genero who tried to
base Japanese foreign policy on friendship with China,
co-operation with the Post-World-War-1 allies, but
found himself frustrated because the general staff
had an idea of statecraft that was a combination of
Bushido and "Blut und Eisen."
IM ERPRETATION
Shidehera will keep down the militarist if he is
able to, but he will have a real fight on his hands.
The schism between ultra-nationalist Japan and
America is so great. The Japanese people would prob
ably be inclined to try again if they thought they had
any chance, and the only possible leadership for such
a venture would come from the army.
Thus Shidehara would need all possible means
al his disposal to check a recurrence of the war
lords' lui tunes. His being placed in power al this
time is bad, because he is one of the few friends
v.e have, and, by being in during the occupation, he
will probably lose face after it is over.
REACTION TO OCCUPATION
The reason is that the occupation has been some
thin" very unsoothing to the Japanese ego. You can't
laugh al people's faith in established mores and ex
pect them to love you for it.
Our entry into the country has caused the Mikado
to "lose face," has operated against the army, against
Bushido, against Shinto. The effect is probably the
same as would be the case if they invaded America,
and started curbing Christianity, telling us that our
ideas of conduct were decadent, and that George
Washington was a crook, and then adding that they
were going to show us the true way of life, their
access to that being because they beat us. Our occu
pation authorities will have to learn what the Com
munist and Fascists dictatorships in Europe found out
the hard way—namely, that thoroughly established
mores have to be not only respected, but actually in
i orporated into the political foundation of your new
order.
OUSTED POLITICOS
For this reason, we must expect a reaction to the
occupation after we leave, and the ministers who
served our generals will soon find themselves ousted
politicians.
'i lie people who will survive will be the ones who
can form third parties, and who can safely damn
both the present government and tiie militarists
without anybody in either group saying, "you
were one of us."
For that reason, we should keep the responsible
politicians like Shidehara in reserve as insurance
against the collapse of what we are building, and not
put them in a position where the roof can fall on
top <if them. For this reason, his re-instatement is
probably unwise in the long term view.

The new premier is an old-line Genero who tried to
base Japanese foreign policy on friendship with China,
co-operation with the Post-World-War-1 allies, but
found himself frustrated because the general staff
had an idea of statecraft that was a combination of
Bushido and "Blut und Eisen."
IM ERPRETATION
Shidehera will keep down the militarist if he is
able to, but he will have a real fight on his hands.
The schism between ultra-nationalist Japan and
America is so great. The Japanese people would prob
ably be inclined to try again if they thought they had
any chance, and the only possible leadership for such
a venture would come from the army.
Thus Shidehara would need all possible means
al his disposal to check a recurrence of the war
lords' lui tunes. His being placed in power al this
time is bad, because he is one of the few friends
v.e have, and, by being in during the occupation, he
will probably lose face after it is over.
REACTION TO OCCUPATION
The reason is that the occupation has been some
thin" very unsoothing to the Japanese ego. You can't
laugh al people's faith in established mores and ex
pect them to love you for it.
Our entry into the country has caused the Mikado
to "lose face," has operated against the army, against
Bushido, against Shinto. The effect is probably the
same as would be the case if they invaded America,
and started curbing Christianity, telling us that our
ideas of conduct were decadent, and that George
Washington was a crook, and then adding that they
were going to show us the true way of life, their
access to that being because they beat us. Our occu
pation authorities will have to learn what the Com
munist and Fascists dictatorships in Europe found out
the hard way—namely, that thoroughly established
mores have to be not only respected, but actually in
i orporated into the political foundation of your new
order.
OUSTED POLITICOS
For this reason, we must expect a reaction to the
occupation after we leave, and the ministers who
served our generals will soon find themselves ousted
politicians.
'i lie people who will survive will be the ones who
can form third parties, and who can safely damn
both the present government and tiie militarists
without anybody in either group saying, "you
were one of us."
For that reason, we should keep the responsible
politicians like Shidehara in reserve as insurance
against the collapse of what we are building, and not
put them in a position where the roof can fall on
top <if them. For this reason, his re-instatement is
probably unwise in the long term view.
Shidehora, who fought the militarists so hard dur
ing their early rise to power in Japan, has returned
to power. Iligashi-Kuhni, the militarist premier of
a nation that we were supposed to be physically and
ink llectually demilitarizing, is out.
