AN OPEN LETTER TO DON ALLAN
As a student at Stanford, as a veteran, and as a
citizen of a democracy, I believe no article such as
Mr. Allan's should go unchallenged. No such dog
matic collection of misrepresentations, contraditions,
and ill-conceived notions should be taken by Stanford
students as representative of veterans' ideas.
In considering the "problems uf (he returning
veteran," it must first he noted and clearly un
derstood that there are at least two separate and
distinct kinds of veterans: those who believe that
the world, including Stanford, owes them a living,
and those who want to get back into civilian life
and try to forget even that they are veterans. I
believe the latter are in the great majority.
As for the veterans that Mr. Allan says this Uni
versity may lose because they are not given special
consideration, 1 say good riddance; I am sure the loss
will be felt only by those who leave. New students
here were treated just as new students; those who
expected some special consideration by virtue of
having worked for the Government lor a time may
well have been disappointed. If they were "plainly
disgusted" they certainly don't belong here.
ARMY LINES TOO
Of course everything wasn't just like the pamph
let (one of Allan's criticisms), but is this ever the
case? Why, it even occurs in service and should
appeal to a veteran and recall to his mind that life
in service wasn't just what the recruiting officer said
it would be. Also, to an ex-enlisted man I am sure
the reference to long lines was a joke. Any who went
out on transports waited as long for a day's meals.
I, for one, was glad for the opportunity to do some
waiting of my own volition—at least it was some
thing worth waiting for.
During the several hours I waited in the Regis
trar's office I was impressed with the courteousness
and amiability of the secretaries in spite of some
impatient and even ill-mannered would-be stu
dents. I did however notice that in or out of uni
form. colonel or seaman second, each was given
equal treatment.
It is absurd to suggest (as Allan did) that secre
taries here would be unable to distinguish between
uniforms of the Navy and Marines, and besides, what
possible difference would it make?
Ex-Bombardier Allan's article has considerable ref
erence to particular veteran's problems, going so
far as to say that secretarial help who are ignorant
of them should be fired. What problems he then
presented were student problems—not at all pe
culiar to veterans —which are properly handled not
by secretaries but by the officials themselves.
THINK FOR YOURSELF
Just what the experience of the average new stu
dent —veteran or otherwise —was regarding advisers
would have to be determined by a study of it. I, for
one, was glad for the opportunity to do some think
ing for myself. Should a college man have to be
told every move to make?
In contrast to Allan's experence, I was coun
selled by competent professors who were both
patient and understanding and left me with no
impression that I was being rushed, though, of
course, registration day is a busy one. I found
these advisers by asking a few simple questions—
no signs, no assembly, no "G. I. registration mill"
such as Allan suggested. Could it be that my being
new to Stanford gave me an advantage?
Do veterans in general — excluding Allan—ac
tually want to be processed "a la Army?" Do they
want Stanford to "take a tip from the Army and run
veteran applicants through with Army precision and
dispatch?" If the general opinion of veteran soldiers
—not officers —is unchanged, I am sure they would
chorus a resounding "No." I think they want to be
just civilians. Allan contradicts himself later in the
article, but, in case you were disgusted before you
got over to column seven, I'll quote: "The returning
soldier does not want, to be set apart from his fellow
students." Now what do you call the special regis
tration assembly for veterans that he suggested if it
isn't setting them apart?
NO MORE ARMY SYSTEM
No doubt some improvement could be made in
the registration system; there is always room for im
provement. We are not in college to maintain the
world but to be able to improve it, but let's leave
the Army system out of Stanford. When improving,
let's improve a Stanford way—l have grown to like
the Stanford way in the two weeks I have been here.
Explanation of the G. I. Hill and other veteran
rights is decidedly not a Stanford responsibility. It
is a Veterans' Administration responsibility, and I,
for one, am satisfied with what I have learned
from that agency. Were I not, I certainly wouldn't
demonstrate my ignorance by chastising Stanford
for that which is distinctly government business.
There is a Stanford organization, The University
Committee on Veterans' Education, whose func
tion is to assist in veterans' problems. Any griev
ance on the part of a Stanford veteran should be
taken first to that committee.
I understand that besides the G. I. Bill there is
the Veterans' Rehabilitation program designed
amongst other things, to supervise more closely the
education of veteran psychoneurotics who are unable
to adjust to civilian life. Any veteran who feels
himself unable to adjust to the very strenuous life
of a Stanford student should either avail himself
of this rehabilitation program, enter a Veterans' Hos
pital for psychoneurotics, or better yet he can re
enlist and get back into the "brisk unequivocal meth
ods of military routine," lauded by Allan.
NO DISTINCTIONS
I believe that, in general, veterans don't want to
be "handled." Don't take them by the hand and say
"you are a veteran, therefore we must conceive some
thing a little less than the military and a little more
than civilian (or vice versa) and the curious abortion
thus born will gradually reconvert you."
I, for one, want no special consideration from
Stanford by virtue of my being a veteran. Now
that the war is over let the veterans along with
everyone else look forward constructively to the
future—at least we should avoid such nonsense
as a suggestion that Stanford initiate a brand of
military "efficiency" totally foreign (o her long
standing educational policies.
SHORTAGE EVERYWHERE
The housing shortage (which evidently bothered
Allan) is not distinctly a Stanford situation; it is a
Peninsula, a state, and even a national problem. I
was assured by Dean Stalnaker that the University
is doing all it can to house students; suggestions
regarding this might better be referred to him rather
than the whole student body.
The Los Trancos Woods idea of Allan's might work,
but I'd like to see people there willing to rent to any
Stanford student, veteran or otherwise. Many veterans
probably feel they have had just about enough time
in the Quonset Huts Allan suggested, but they might
trade them to students who have never had an op
portunity to live in one.
Stanford simply isn't the kind of place Allan de
scribes. Look around you. fellow students; count
your blessings then drop into the Chapel and thank
God von are here. JIM COLE.
