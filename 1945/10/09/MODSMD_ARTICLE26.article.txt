# Dr. Farnsworth Analyzes Race Prejudice Factors
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
"Racial discrimination is based on
several general factors, including
economic competition, religious dif
ferences, historical backgrounds, and
nationalism," said Dr. Paul R. Farns
worth, professor of psychology, in a
recent interview.
Economic Competition A Factor
In discussing psychological fac
tors in racial discrimination, Dr.
Farnsworth declared that perhaps
the greatest single factor contribut
ing to racial discrimination is eco
nomic competition. It was this fac
tor that led to much of the anti-
Japanese, anti-Chinese, anti-Mexi
can. and anti-Filipino feeling on the
West Coast before the war.
Since the war started. Dr. Farns
worth pointed out, much of this dis
criminating feeling has disappeared
—for several reasons. "For one
thing,"' he said, "economic competi
tion disappeared because of the need
for labor; and in particular the Fili
pinos and Chinese we had to like
because they were our allies."
Explains Detroit Situation
Economic competition is also one
of the main factors in anti-Negro
discrimination in the Detroit area
and in the south, Dr. Farnsworth ad
ded. He said that there has been a
rise in feeling against Negroes in
the Bay Area since the start of the
war, due again to economic compe
tition when many of them came
here to work in war industries.
"There has been much work done
in the United States to eliminate
feeling against the Negro," Dr.
Farnsworth said, "but a purely
verbal approach won't help much
to decrease anti-racial feeling."
Religious Discrimination
Religious intolerance is another
strong factor in discrimination, said
Dr. Farnsworth. This is particular
ly true in the case of the Jews and
other small religious sects.
"It is odd," he stated, "but if
one group which has been sub
jected to religious persecution sud
denly gains supremacy, it turns
around and persecutes another sect."
Principle of 'Bullying'
Then there is the important fac
tor of compensation for one's own
shortcomings by picking on some
one else, he added.
"People like to belong to the 'in'
group" Dr. Farnsworth said, "and
they like to feel superior to what
they may consider an 'out' group.
This is not so easy when there are
no marked characteristics to dis
tinguish the 'in' from the 'out'
group. But it is much simpler, for
discrimination purposes, if the 'out'
group has such indentifying physic
al characteristics as yellow or black
skin, kinky hair, slanting eyes and
so forth."
Prejudices Not Admitted
"Of course," Dr. Farnsworth con
tinued, "no American wants to ad
mit that he is prejudiced against
another racial or religious group.

So he rationalizes this prejudice by
telling himself that such a race is
particularly dumb, or tries to out
wit everyone else, or that that group
is guilty of discrimination against
others."
Historical background plays some
part in contributing to racial dis
crimination particularly if descend
ants ol one nation are historical ene
mies of descendants of another na
tion, Dr. Farnsworth said. Some
racial and religious prejudices have
existed for centuries and have had
a definite part in the shaping of
history, he added.
Wishes Influence Opinion
To show how our own wishes in
fluence our opinions of other groups,
Dr. Farnsworth cited an experiment
made at Stanford and the University
of Chicago in 1943. Unidentified
pictures of former Stanford Chinese
and Japanese students were shown
to a group of students who were
asked to tell the nationality of each
individual in the photographs.
"They could pick the Chinese
from the Japanese with an average
of a little better than chance," Dr.
Farnsworth told, "and in this test
Stanford students did better than
the Chicago group."
Test Fools Students
The subjects were then told to
pick out the most Caucasian look
ing individuals. Here again the stu
dents correctly identified the Jap
anese as being most Caucasian—
but they thought their choices were
Chinese.
"We like to think our allies look
more like us than our enemies,"
Dr. Farnsworth commented.
Subsidization of Schools
Dr. Farnsworth said he believed
the Federal government will event
ually have to subsidize education
in the south. "The south is too
poor to support two school systems
(i.e. one for Negroes and one for
whites)," he said, "with the result

that neither whites nor Negroes
have educational opportunities
equal to those found in the north."
When asked how racial discrimi
nation could be eliminated Dr.
Farnsworth said that it would be a
"long slow process. We can't be
too violent in our approach. How
ever, anything that helps to equal
ize educational opportunities for all
groups, and helps to reduce eco
nomic competition will be all to the
good.'"

group. But it is much simpler, for
discrimination purposes, if the 'out'
group has such indentifying physic
al characteristics as yellow or black
skin, kinky hair, slanting eyes and
so forth."
Prejudices Not Admitted
"Of course," Dr. Farnsworth con
tinued, "no American wants to ad
mit that he is prejudiced against
another racial or religious group.

So he rationalizes this prejudice by
telling himself that such a race is
particularly dumb, or tries to out
wit everyone else, or that that group
is guilty of discrimination against
others."
Historical background plays some
part in contributing to racial dis
crimination particularly if descend
ants ol one nation are historical ene
mies of descendants of another na
tion, Dr. Farnsworth said. Some
racial and religious prejudices have
existed for centuries and have had
a definite part in the shaping of
history, he added.
Wishes Influence Opinion
To show how our own wishes in
fluence our opinions of other groups,
Dr. Farnsworth cited an experiment
made at Stanford and the University
of Chicago in 1943. Unidentified
pictures of former Stanford Chinese
and Japanese students were shown
to a group of students who were
asked to tell the nationality of each
individual in the photographs.
"They could pick the Chinese
from the Japanese with an average
of a little better than chance," Dr.
Farnsworth told, "and in this test
Stanford students did better than
the Chicago group."
Test Fools Students
The subjects were then told to
pick out the most Caucasian look
ing individuals. Here again the stu
dents correctly identified the Jap
anese as being most Caucasian—
but they thought their choices were
Chinese.
"We like to think our allies look
more like us than our enemies,"
Dr. Farnsworth commented.
Subsidization of Schools
Dr. Farnsworth said he believed
the Federal government will event
ually have to subsidize education
in the south. "The south is too
poor to support two school systems
(i.e. one for Negroes and one for
whites)," he said, "with the result

that neither whites nor Negroes
have educational opportunities
equal to those found in the north."
When asked how racial discrimi
nation could be eliminated Dr.
Farnsworth said that it would be a
"long slow process. We can't be
too violent in our approach. How
ever, anything that helps to equal
ize educational opportunities for all
groups, and helps to reduce eco
nomic competition will be all to the
good.'"


DR. PAUL R. FARNSWORTH
"Racial discrimination is based on
several general factors, including
economic competition, religious dif
ferences, historical backgrounds, and
nationalism," said Dr. Paul R. Farns
worth, professor of psychology, in a
recent interview.
Economic Competition A Factor
In discussing psychological fac
tors in racial discrimination, Dr.
Farnsworth declared that perhaps
the greatest single factor contribut
ing to racial discrimination is eco
nomic competition. It was this fac
tor that led to much of the anti-
Japanese, anti-Chinese, anti-Mexi
can. and anti-Filipino feeling on the
West Coast before the war.
Since the war started. Dr. Farns
worth pointed out, much of this dis
criminating feeling has disappeared
—for several reasons. "For one
thing,"' he said, "economic competi
tion disappeared because of the need
for labor; and in particular the Fili
pinos and Chinese we had to like
because they were our allies."
Explains Detroit Situation
Economic competition is also one
of the main factors in anti-Negro
discrimination in the Detroit area
and in the south, Dr. Farnsworth ad
ded. He said that there has been a
rise in feeling against Negroes in
the Bay Area since the start of the
war, due again to economic compe
tition when many of them came
here to work in war industries.
"There has been much work done
in the United States to eliminate
feeling against the Negro," Dr.
Farnsworth said, "but a purely
verbal approach won't help much
to decrease anti-racial feeling."
Religious Discrimination
Religious intolerance is another
strong factor in discrimination, said
Dr. Farnsworth. This is particular
ly true in the case of the Jews and
other small religious sects.
"It is odd," he stated, "but if
one group which has been sub
jected to religious persecution sud
denly gains supremacy, it turns
around and persecutes another sect."
Principle of 'Bullying'
Then there is the important fac
tor of compensation for one's own
shortcomings by picking on some
one else, he added.
"People like to belong to the 'in'
group" Dr. Farnsworth said, "and
they like to feel superior to what
they may consider an 'out' group.
This is not so easy when there are
no marked characteristics to dis
tinguish the 'in' from the 'out'
group. But it is much simpler, for
discrimination purposes, if the 'out'
group has such indentifying physic

ever, anything that helps to equal

groups, and helps to reduce eco
nomic competition will be all to the

DR. PAUL R. FARNSWORTH
"Racial discrimination is based on
several general factors, including
economic competition, religious dif
ferences, historical backgrounds, and
nationalism," said Dr. Paul R. Farns
worth, professor of psychology, in a
recent interview.
Economic Competition A Factor
In discussing psychological fac
tors in racial discrimination, Dr.
Farnsworth declared that perhaps
the greatest single factor contribut
ing to racial discrimination is eco
nomic competition. It was this fac
tor that led to much of the anti-
Japanese, anti-Chinese, anti-Mexi
can. and anti-Filipino feeling on the
West Coast before the war.
Since the war started. Dr. Farns
worth pointed out, much of this dis
criminating feeling has disappeared
—for several reasons. "For one
thing,"' he said, "economic competi
tion disappeared because of the need
for labor; and in particular the Fili
pinos and Chinese we had to like
because they were our allies."
Explains Detroit Situation
Economic competition is also one
of the main factors in anti-Negro
discrimination in the Detroit area
and in the south, Dr. Farnsworth ad
ded. He said that there has been a
rise in feeling against Negroes in
the Bay Area since the start of the
war, due again to economic compe
tition when many of them came
here to work in war industries.
"There has been much work done
in the United States to eliminate
feeling against the Negro," Dr.
Farnsworth said, "but a purely
verbal approach won't help much
to decrease anti-racial feeling."
Religious Discrimination
Religious intolerance is another
strong factor in discrimination, said
Dr. Farnsworth. This is particular
ly true in the case of the Jews and
other small religious sects.
"It is odd," he stated, "but if
one group which has been sub
jected to religious persecution sud
denly gains supremacy, it turns
around and persecutes another sect."
Principle of 'Bullying'
Then there is the important fac
tor of compensation for one's own
shortcomings by picking on some
one else, he added.
"People like to belong to the 'in'
group" Dr. Farnsworth said, "and
they like to feel superior to what
they may consider an 'out' group.
This is not so easy when there are
no marked characteristics to dis
tinguish the 'in' from the 'out'
group. But it is much simpler, for
discrimination purposes, if the 'out'
group has such indentifying physic
al characteristics as yellow or black
skin, kinky hair, slanting eyes and
so forth."
Prejudices Not Admitted
"Of course," Dr. Farnsworth con
tinued, "no American wants to ad
mit that he is prejudiced against
another racial or religious group.

So he rationalizes this prejudice by
telling himself that such a race is
particularly dumb, or tries to out
wit everyone else, or that that group
is guilty of discrimination against
others."
Historical background plays some
part in contributing to racial dis
crimination particularly if descend
ants ol one nation are historical ene
mies of descendants of another na
tion, Dr. Farnsworth said. Some
racial and religious prejudices have
existed for centuries and have had
a definite part in the shaping of
history, he added.
Wishes Influence Opinion
To show how our own wishes in
fluence our opinions of other groups,
Dr. Farnsworth cited an experiment
made at Stanford and the University
of Chicago in 1943. Unidentified
pictures of former Stanford Chinese
and Japanese students were shown
to a group of students who were
asked to tell the nationality of each
individual in the photographs.
"They could pick the Chinese
from the Japanese with an average
of a little better than chance," Dr.
Farnsworth told, "and in this test
Stanford students did better than
the Chicago group."
Test Fools Students
The subjects were then told to
pick out the most Caucasian look
ing individuals. Here again the stu
dents correctly identified the Jap
anese as being most Caucasian—
but they thought their choices were
Chinese.
"We like to think our allies look
more like us than our enemies,"
Dr. Farnsworth commented.
Subsidization of Schools
Dr. Farnsworth said he believed
the Federal government will event
ually have to subsidize education
in the south. "The south is too
poor to support two school systems
(i.e. one for Negroes and one for
whites)," he said, "with the result

that neither whites nor Negroes
have educational opportunities
equal to those found in the north."
When asked how racial discrimi
nation could be eliminated Dr.
Farnsworth said that it would be a
"long slow process. We can't be
too violent in our approach. How
ever, anything that helps to equal
ize educational opportunities for all
groups, and helps to reduce eco
nomic competition will be all to the
