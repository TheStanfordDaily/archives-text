### STANLEY WILSON 
Plaudits should be extended to one Robert Cush
ing Kennedy for the manner in which he performed
at the Cal-Stanford conference this last weekend
. . . particularly the way he protected his brood of
fellow delegates. But, Bob, next time remind me to
take my own blankets. The back seat of your car is
a little drafty for sleeping! But, seriously, the con
ference was well worthwhile, and a foundation was
laid for future advantageous conclaves.
<«■■«<>•<
Thinking of Cal reminds me of a gaggy interlude
we experienced not so long ago in the Daily Shack.
There was a teletype story coming in relating to an
interview with the Bear's new coach, Buck Shaw.
His footballers had just dropped their second straight
game, and Buck was just a little pushed about the
whole thing. Apparently, there was a new teletype
operator on the job, because here's how the yarn
went: "It is obvious Buck Shaw is not satisfied with
the way things have been going with his grid team
this year. He wasn't a little disgruntled following his
last defeat. This stateemnt by Shaw to his team
last Monday will evidence his dissatisfaction: '&(?$:-
&&&!!!)?**:s& —~(!':ss!".
Like I keep saying—Those Cal boys are eo crude!

Question of the Week: What is the dope on that
screamingly red convertible seen parked in front
of Dean Mary Yost's house every day in the week?
Ah, that rah rah, Joe College spirit ... I love it!
♦ *
After yesterday's World Series thriller, my finger
nails are down to the elbows, I'll have to copy notes
for the two classes I missed, and I'm taking seda
tives for nervous prostration, on the hour, every '
hour. Come on, you bums, next quarter's tuition
and my beer allowance depends on tomorrow's finale, j

Several campus students have approached me with
the following suggestions: First, that Stanford car
owners remember the old tradition of picking up
riders going to and from Paly. This is a courtesy
which was followed religiously some years back, but i
it decreased during the gas-rationed war years. Stu
dently wishing rides into Paly generally are found at |
the Book Store corner. Encina, the History corner |
juid at the head of Palm Drive. For return trips help
the guy who is standing at Wilson's corner on Uni
versity avenue.
The next suggestion came from a couple of co-eds
concerning wearing apparel on Quad. When silk
stockings and nylons went out a few years ago, the
girls returned to their high school practice of wearing
bobby sox. Now there is a movement on campus
to revert to the prewar habit of wearing hose to
class. Besides, they say a set of gams look better
with hose wrapped around them in place of bobby
sox. Personally, I wouldn't know. I'm too interested
in my courses.

Thinking of Cal reminds me of a gaggy interlude
we experienced not so long ago in the Daily Shack.
There was a teletype story coming in relating to an
interview with the Bear's new coach, Buck Shaw.
His footballers had just dropped their second straight
game, and Buck was just a little pushed about the
whole thing. Apparently, there was a new teletype
operator on the job, because here's how the yarn
went: "It is obvious Buck Shaw is not satisfied with
the way things have been going with his grid team
this year. He wasn't a little disgruntled following his
last defeat. This stateemnt by Shaw to his team
last Monday will evidence his dissatisfaction: '&(?$:-
&&&!!!)?**:s& —~(!':ss!".
Like I keep saying—Those Cal boys are eo crude!

Question of the Week: What is the dope on that
screamingly red convertible seen parked in front
of Dean Mary Yost's house every day in the week?
Ah, that rah rah, Joe College spirit ... I love it!

After yesterday's World Series thriller, my finger
nails are down to the elbows, I'll have to copy notes
for the two classes I missed, and I'm taking seda
tives for nervous prostration, on the hour, every '
hour. Come on, you bums, next quarter's tuition

Several campus students have approached me with
the following suggestions: First, that Stanford car
owners remember the old tradition of picking up
riders going to and from Paly. This is a courtesy
which was followed religiously some years back, but i
it decreased during the gas-rationed war years. Stu
dently wishing rides into Paly generally are found at |
the Book Store corner. Encina, the History corner |
juid at the head of Palm Drive. For return trips help
the guy who is standing at Wilson's corner on Uni
versity avenue.
The next suggestion came from a couple of co-eds
concerning wearing apparel on Quad. When silk
stockings and nylons went out a few years ago, the
girls returned to their high school practice of wearing
bobby sox. Now there is a movement on campus
to revert to the prewar habit of wearing hose to
class. Besides, they say a set of gams look better
with hose wrapped around them in place of bobby
sox. Personally, I wouldn't know. I'm too interested
in my courses.
Plaudits should be extended to one Robert Cush
ing Kennedy for the manner in which he performed
at the Cal-Stanford conference this last weekend
. . . particularly the way he protected his brood of
fellow delegates. But, Bob, next time remind me to
take my own blankets. The back seat of your car is
a little drafty for sleeping! But, seriously, the con
ference was well worthwhile, and a foundation was
laid for future advantageous conclaves.
