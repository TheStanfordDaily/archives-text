# Women's Vocational Help Centers in Dean's Office
## 
### MARTHA SCHWIMLEY 
The specific responsibility of vo
cational help for women at Stan
lord is centered in the Dean of
Women's Office in the Administra
tion Building. There Anastasia
Doyle, appointed by the president
of the University as assistant in
vocational and academic advising,
works with Dean Mary Yost to
help Stanford women find a voca
tion which interests them and in
which they are likely to succeed.
Office Taps Sources
The Dean of Women's office is able
to tap many sources of informa
tion lo help those who come there I
for guidance. In the office itself
is kept a current file of university
bulletins from all over the United
States in fields of interest to women.
Other literature, such as government
publications, especially from the
Women's Bureau of the Department
of Labor, "Occupations" magazine,
and "Reprints of Science Research
Associates" are also available. The
office subscribes to the Western
Personnel Service which sends out
vocational material on occupations
for college men and women in the
western area. The main library is
especially helpful in purchasing vo- i
catior.al material for use by the Dean
of Women's Office and the students, j
"Vocom" Gives Information
The Vocational Guidance Com
mitter, which has as its chairman
Paul R. Farnsworth of the Psychol
ogy Department and is made up of

' faculty members, is laying plans to j
j increase vocational guidance at Stan
j ford.
A cooperative relationship exists
I between the Dean of Women's office
and women students through Worn- j
en's Conference. A program of vo- j
cational discussions and lectures has |

been hekl the last few years under
he name of "Voeom" (Vocational
Committee) and has served to in
form students of important occu
pational fields. During fall quarter
surveys were made to see which
careers were of interest to most
women, and during winter quarter
Vocom presented speakers and in
formation which they felt would be
most valuable to the majority. Vo
com provided an opportunity for
the women to gain information
about occupations they were inter
ested in by enabling them to meet
persons already successful in those
fields, and to discuss the opportuni
ties with them.
Test Found Helpful
The Strong Vocational Test, avail
able in the Administration Build
ing, is often helpful to women who
wish to know which fields they
would be most successful in. It is
used at Stanford in conjunction
with personal interviews. Every
wonvm registered in Stanford who
takes the test finds out the results
in a personal interview with Miss
Doyle who helps to properly evalu
ate the results of the test.
At Stanford there is no required
vocational conference at any time
during the course. Vocational guid
ance is offered to all, but not forced
on students. According to Miss
Doyle, the greatest results are at
tained if the student feels the need
for auvice and suggestion.
