# History Sets Pace For '45 Music Series
## Artists Sousa, Tibbett, Iturbi, Stud Scrapbook of Past Concert Managers 
### 
Nineteen-twenty-eight was a big
year for the Stanford Concert
Series, then in its third season.
For it was in that year that John
Philip Sousa, "The March King,"
fame to the campus to give a con
cert on the eve of Herbert
Hoover's election. A march up
the Row to the Hoover home led
by the band was planned for that
occasion. That same night Sousa
celebrated his 74th birthday.
Stories such as this are to be
found in the scrap books which
past managers of the Concert Series
have kept throughout the # years,
present Series Manager Jo Glasson,
said. Concerts originally were held
in the Pavilion, but moved to the
Memorial Hall when it was built a
few years ago.
Names of performers who have
appeared at Stanford since the
Series started are still well
known in the entertainment world.
In the 1929-30 Series Will Rogers,
billed as a satirical humorist, ap
peared. Another year the U. S.
Marine Band played here. Law
rence Tibbett has entertained
here several times.
"The Concert Series, entirely self
supporting, is under the supervis
ion of the A.5.5.U.," Miss Glasson
explained. The manager is promoted
each year from the position of as
sistant manager and the new as
sistant is appointed by the outgoing
manager.
Artists arc selected, arranged
for through an agent, a budget is
made, and then printing is done,
said Miss Glasson, describing the
year-round job of the manager.
Letters to subscribers are then
sent and subscriptions arc ar
ranged for.
The campus formerly entertained

the artists either at dinners or at
open houses, but this was discon
tinued during the war. It is not
known whether or not anything of
this sort will be resumed.
This year's Series features some
artists who have never before per
formed at Stanford, Miss Glasson
said. The duo-pianist team of
Luboshutz and Nemenoff is "very
skilled." They were born in Russia
and trained in Paris. This is their
first appearance at Stanford.
Rise Stevens 'is also to give a
concert this year. "The San Fran
cisco Symphony has not per
formed on campus since the war,"
Miss Glasson said, "and its man
ager states that the orchestra is
most anxious to play what stu
dents will like.
Among those artists who have ap
peared at Stanford before are Eliza
beth Rothberg, the Vienna Choir
Boys, the Don Cossacks, John
Charles Thomas, Helen Jepson.
Grace Moore and Jose Iturbi.
Assisting at the Series office this
year are Annette Kirkman and La-
Verne O'Neil.
