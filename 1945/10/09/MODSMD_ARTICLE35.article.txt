SEATTLE, Oct. 8 (UP).â€”Coach
Ralph Welch of the Washington
Huskies ran his travel-weary foot
ballsqua dthrough their paces with
out let-up today, seeking to bolster
the Husky line and spark up its
attack in readiness for the tradi

Berkeley by the California Bears,
devoted most of today's workouts to
blocking and tackling practice, and
hinted at line changes.
