The question that has befuddled
multitudes of persons from the be
ginning of time has finally been
answered as far as sports fans are
concerned.
What happens when the irresist
ab!e force meets the immovable ob
ject is no longer a riddle to avid
link; lans.
Byron Nelson, sandy-haired shot
maker who sells umbrellas when he
isn't giving par a shellacking, has
finally succumbed to the staleness
that hits all top-flight golfers at
one time or another.
After winning tournament after
tournament for the past year to rack
up a new money-winning record.
Lord Byron finally slipped to a low
money slot in the Portland Open.
Jimmy Hines, a pro who has not
been in the front ranks of play-for
play hnksmen, finally succeeded in
cracking the big-time circle of King
Nelson and his most loyal subjects,
Jug McSpaden, Sammy Snead, and
Ben Hogan.
Admitting that he is terribly off
his game, Nelson, who has achieved
the reputation of having ice-cold
coca cola running through his arter
ies. slipped to a 283 for seventy-two
holes, one of his worst official rounds
to date.
So it rather looks as if the ir
resistable force must bow to the im
movable object. After all, nobody
has beaten old man time yet.
