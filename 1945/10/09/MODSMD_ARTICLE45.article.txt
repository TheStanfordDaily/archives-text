Hank Greenberg, one of the great
est hitters of all time stepped up to
the plate yesterday and slapped a
three and two pitch high into the
left field stands to knot the scare
7-7 in the Detroit-Chicago Cubs se
ries. Then Stan Hack's 2-base hit
bounded high over his head, allow
ing the winning run to score, thus
giving the Cubs the sixth world
series game in the twelfth inning.
Self Made Man
Hank Greenberg is one of the
most conscientious ballplayers of all
time. He has literally pulled him
self up by his bootstraps in mak
ing himself the most feared batter
in the American this year.
Back when he was breaking in
with Tiger farm chain, Hank worked
| eight hours a day at his job, and
| even went so far as to have neigh
borhood kids pitch to him—for a
price of course—in order to develop
his hitting for which he is so noted.
Aside from slugging, Hank was al
so one of the best first basemen in
the business and the only reason
he is playing in the outer garden
for Detroit now is because Steve
O'Neill would to keep both Hank
and Rudy York in the same lineup
because of their batting abilities.
When Hank finally went to the
big show with Detroit he was fifth
or sixth in the lineup and hitting
like a real big leaguer, whereas
the cleanup man for Detroit was
in a terrific slump. Hank asked
for the position and got it—no
one has been sorry since. Hank
has hit thirteen homeruns in sev
i enty odd games for his team this
year including two in the world
series now being played. lie is
one of the few players who has

hit a round tripper in every series
he has ever played in—four to
date.
In 1940. two years before he en
i tered the service, Captain Hank hit
| 58 homers to come within two round
trippers of eclipsing the immortal
George Herman "Babe" Ruth's rec
ord set in the late 1920'5. When he
was discharged from the service
about mid-season of this year's base
ball schedule, his old admirers won
dered if he could come back—well
< you all know what happened. Big
Hank hit a homer the first day back
in uniform, and batted .309 for 77
games this season. He also finished
out the season with 13 homers, al
most as many as a great number of
regulars hit all season, and, to top
it off Hank blasted a grand slam
circuit clout on the last day of the
regular season to give the Tigers
the pennant.
At 34 Hank Greenberg is one
of the best and most diligent play
i ers in the game, and on top. of
that a theorist—something very
hire among Itaschall players.

The arrival of handsome thirtiesh
j Marr.hie Schwartz denotes another
j milestone on the road to the Cardin
als return to athletics as did the
inauguration of basketball practice
for the first time in three years
with the return of Coach Everett
Dean.
Coach Elwyn Bugge has also in
formed us that we may have a tennis
team this year, and Coach Harry
Wolter will begin baseball practice
this winter when he returns from his
well earned vacation. Although the
San Francisco papers seem to de
light in letting the Daily scoop them
on this seemingly insignificent item,
maybe they will sit up and take
notice when they see what Stanford
has to offer this year.
