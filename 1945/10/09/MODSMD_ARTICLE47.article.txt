# Chicago Cubs Even Series
## 
### STU MILLAR 
The Chicago Cubs roared back
at the Detroit Tigers yesterday
and clawed their way into a
three-all tie with the Bengals to
throw the first peace-time edition
of the World Series into a full
seven-game affair.
The Bruins did it the hard way.
Alter gaining a substantial lead in
the early innings, they let the Tigers
prolong it for twelve innings before
they clinched it by a score of 8 to 7.
The deciding margin was pro
duced by Secory's single and Hack's
hit which bounced over Greenberg's
head.
Undoubtedly yesterday's classic
will go down in the annals of
horsehide history as one of the
most famous post-season contests
of all time. The packed stands of
Wrigley Field in Chicago soon
realized that the clash of the two
hard-fighting ball clubs was eoing
to provide more than their mon
ey's worth, for not only was it a
tense, exciting game from start to
finish, hut more than the average
number of records were broken.
The Tigers cracked the ice in the
second inning when Cullenbine
walked, York doubled, and Outlaw
and Richards strolled to force in
the first run of the game.
But the Cubs exploded for what
looked like the ball game in the
filth when Livingston and Hughes
singled and everyone was safe on
Passeau's fielder's choice. With the
bases bulging Stan Hack singled,
Lowrey walked and Phil Cavaretta
singled to put the Cubs three mark
ers to the good.
However, the Cub thirst for
runs was still not quenched for

Livingston and Hughes put to
gether doubles to account for an
other digit in the next inning.
The Tigers, although many of
their fans throughout the country
were already talking about Wed
nesday's game, refused to give up.
In the seventh, Cramer's single,
Greenberg's pass and Cullenbine's
and York's bingles brought the Ti
gers two runs closer.
But the Cubs came right back
with two more on two singles and
three walks.
At this point, even the most rabid
of the Detroit fans were about to
concede the Cub victory, but stout
Steve O'Neill's boys bounced right
back.
Swift's walk. Walker's double.

Hack's error on Hoover's bound
er. Mayo's single which turned
into an out when lie tried to
stretch it.and Hank (Ireenhers's
home run tied the hall game at
seven apiece.
And then with the tension at its
highest peak, the two teams battled
for four full innings without a score.
But the Cubs were fated to win
this one, for they pulled it out in
the terrible twelfth.
Charlie Grimm, mentor of the
overjoyed windy-city boys, has yet
to name his starting hurler for Wed
nesday's deciding game, but his
choice is likely to be Tom P;<u!

troit will be Hurricane Hal Now

The Chicago Cubs roared back
at the Detroit Tigers yesterday
and clawed their way into a
three-all tie with the Bengals to
throw the first peace-time edition
of the World Series into a full
seven-game affair.
The Bruins did it the hard way.
Alter gaining a substantial lead in
the early innings, they let the Tigers
prolong it for twelve innings before
they clinched it by a score of 8 to 7.
The deciding margin was pro
duced by Secory's single and Hack's
hit which bounced over Greenberg's
head.
Undoubtedly yesterday's classic
will go down in the annals of
horsehide history as one of the
most famous post-season contests
of all time. The packed stands of
Wrigley Field in Chicago soon
realized that the clash of the two
hard-fighting ball clubs was eoing
to provide more than their mon
ey's worth, for not only was it a
tense, exciting game from start to
finish, hut more than the average
number of records were broken.
The Tigers cracked the ice in the
second inning when Cullenbine
walked, York doubled, and Outlaw
and Richards strolled to force in
the first run of the game.
But the Cubs exploded for what
looked like the ball game in the
filth when Livingston and Hughes
singled and everyone was safe on
Passeau's fielder's choice. With the
bases bulging Stan Hack singled,
Lowrey walked and Phil Cavaretta
singled to put the Cubs three mark
ers to the good.
However, the Cub thirst for
runs was still not quenched for

Livingston and Hughes put to
gether doubles to account for an
other digit in the next inning.
The Tigers, although many of
their fans throughout the country
were already talking about Wed
nesday's game, refused to give up.
In the seventh, Cramer's single,
Greenberg's pass and Cullenbine's
and York's bingles brought the Ti
gers two runs closer.
But the Cubs came right back
with two more on two singles and
three walks.
