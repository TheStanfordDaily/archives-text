# Jones Predicts Return of Flying
## Local Airport May Donate Facilities; Solo Requirements To Be Lowered 
### 
Football, rallies, l>ig name hands, new automobiles, more frequent trips
to the city and flying! Peace will bring all of these things hack to the Farm.
And most important of all perhaps is flying. With the rumors concerning
a plane in every garage a great future is predicted for aviation, and Stan
ford will be a part of it.

Endeavoring to discover some
remnant of the extinct Stanford
Flying Clubs, the Daily contacted
Bob Jones, representative <Â»112 the
Progressive Air Service, a local
airport located east of Los Altos.
Bob has been in charge of all or
ganized flying here on campus this
summer. He plans to organize a new
flying club this quarter, the first
meeting of which will be held some
time this week. The exact date will
be announced in the Daily.
"Stanford's former flying club
attempted to buy an airplane, each
member contributing to the cost.
Due to the prohibitive cost of air
planes, and the amount which
would have to be invested by each
member, the plane failed, and we
will not try it," said Boh, who has
three hours in a Piper Cub in his
logbook.
Instead Bob has reached an agree
ment with the Progressive field
whereby members of the club will
obtain reduced rates, providing that
there are a specified number of
people flying each week. The air
port has five Piper Cubs and one
Taylorcraft which will be available
to members.
Bob predicted that since so many

students are returning this year who
have seen active service as flyers
the interest in the club will be
high.
"As soon as we can get an ap
preciable number of students solo
ing it will be possible to declare
a Stanford Day at the field and
have the planes reserved for Farm
members of the club only. In that
way we may be able to plan some
cross-country trips for a large
group," continued Boh.
The requirements for soloing have
been lowered from 8 hours of dual
instruction to any amount that the
instructor deems necessary. The re
duced rate for student members will
be $9 an hour, with a possible furth
er reduction if the membership of
the club is large.
The requirements for a private
pilot's license have also been low
ered to include only a flight exami
nation etst, after 35-40 hours of
logged time, and a test on Civil Air
Regulations. Some ground instruc
tion will be given to members of
the club by the certified instructors
of the airport. Thus any member
of the club will be able to qualify
for his private pilot's license here
at Stanford.
