LONDON, Oct. 8 (UP). â€”Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, 54, who
led Allied armies to victories in Europe, will be named U.S. Army
Chief of Staff within a few weeks, replacing Gen. George C.
Marshall, a veteran of 43 years of Army service, a qualified in
formant said today.
Eisenhower, now serving as commander of American-occu
pied Germany, will leave Europe about Oct. 31 for Washington,
and almost immediately assume the duties of the 65-year-old
Marshall, who has served as Chief of Staff since September, 1939,
a high Army source revealed.
Marshall reportedly favors a post-war military organization
consisting of only a small standing Army augmented by huge
civilian reserves. Recently he was quoted as telling his post-war
military planners that a large regular Army "has no place among
the institutions of a modern democratic state."
Although he has not placed himself on record on the subject,
Eisenhower's plans for a post-war Army reportedly coincide
with Marshall's. At least he is known to favor universal military
training.
