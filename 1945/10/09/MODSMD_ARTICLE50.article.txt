## Conducted Study In Peking, China 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
Dr. Meribeth Cameron, '25, Ph.D.
'28, Dean of Milwaukee-Downer
College, Wisconsin, has returned to
Stanford as visiting professor of Far
Eastern History to teach the courses
which she studied as an undergrad
uate here under Dr. Payson J.
Treat
Remembering the time when
askance was looked at anyone who
professed to be interested in the
history of Eastern Asia, Dr. Cam
eron said the present change to a
widespread interest in anything
Asiatic is remarkable, but under
standable, in the light of the events
of the past decade.
New Interest in Far East
Americans, Californians too, have
come to realize, she said, that any
thing which occurs anywhere is of
interest and importance to this
country and the advances in trans
portation have brought us close to
the lands which should no longer
be called "the far East."
During the academic year 1936-37,
Dr. Cameron was on leave from
Western Reserve University in
Cleveland on a research grant for
study in Peking, China. While
there she carried on research in the

history of modern China in co
operation with Chinese students.
"The Reform Movement in China,
1898-1912," Dr. Cameron's doctor's
thesis, was published by the Uni
versity Press.
Writing Chinese History
At present Dr. Cameron is work- [
ing on a general history of China.
She has gathered most of the ma
terial already and is in the process
of writing it now.
In addition to Dr. Treat's former
courses in Far Eastern History, Dr.
i Cameron is teaching other courses
| in the Far Eastern Department of
j the School of Humanities.
Colorful College Career
Dr. Cameron took the A.B. here
in 1925, A.M. in 1926, A.M. at Rad
cli:c College in 1927, and Ph.D. in
1928. She has been a member of
the faculties of Reed College in
Portland, Ore., Western Reserve in
Cleveland, Clarcmont Graduate
School in Pomona, and is now Dean
of Milwaukee-Downer College in
Wisconsin, which was founded in
1851 by Katherine Beeeher. She is
