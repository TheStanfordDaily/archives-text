# French Art Featured At Stanford Gallery
## 
### 
A group of modern French
paintings loaned by private and
■ public collections on the West
Coast arc on display now, Oct.
7 to 28, in the Stanford Art Gal
lery.
According to Alfred Frankenstein,
summer quarter lecturer in music,
"The Stanford Art Gallery enters a
new phase of its history with this
exhibition of the sources—and some
of the continuing, dynamic factors
—of modern art.
It i; primarily a French exhibition,
but it is not nationally circumscribed
in any way. What these painters
have done is of primary importance
to the art of the entire world; fur
thermore it is far from insignificant
that j show of this kind can now be
made up entirely from West Coast
collections, public and private.
"This exhibition sets forth the
story of two-pronged revolt from
l!)th century academic natural
ism. with its emphasis upon lit
eral representation and literary
suggestion. One side of that re
volt—spear-headed, so far as this
collection is concerned, by Pisarro
—abandoned the facts of nature
for their visual sensation.
"Against the fleeting evanescence
of the impressionists, Cezanne erects
the austere, logical standard of the
monumental, the architectonic, and
the pictorially structural.
"Between these two attitudes,
the sensual and the pattern-mak
ing, the issue was joined. Gau
guin, van Gogh and Matisse com
bine them both, but each in re
sponse to the needs of a highly in
dividual personality.
Imagination Flourishes
"Meanwhile, as (he issue of
Cezanne versus Pisarro was be
ing fought out to its various con
clusions. another tendency of art
continued to flourish. This is the
introspective tendency, which
prizes above everything imagi
nation—the inward vision released
from allegiance to the surround
ing world.
"All these things are omnipresent
in one form or another in the art
of the present day. This exhibition
shows in brief where they came
from. It ties today and yesterday
into a continuing unity and suggests,
perhaps, some of the things that
may be happening tomorrow," Mr.
Frankenstein concludes.
The pictures which are displayed
in the first room of the Gallery
include:

sketch) by Manet; "Tulip in a Green

A group of modern French
paintings loaned by private and

7 to 28, in the Stanford Art Gal
lery.
According to Alfred Frankenstein,
summer quarter lecturer in music,
"The Stanford Art Gallery enters a
new phase of its history with this
exhibition of the sources—and some
of the continuing, dynamic factors
—of modern art.
It i; primarily a French exhibition,
but it is not nationally circumscribed
in any way. What these painters
have done is of primary importance
to the art of the entire world; fur
thermore it is far from insignificant
that j show of this kind can now be
made up entirely from West Coast
collections, public and private.
"This exhibition sets forth the
story of two-pronged revolt from
l!)th century academic natural
ism. with its emphasis upon lit
eral representation and literary
suggestion. One side of that re
volt—spear-headed, so far as this
collection is concerned, by Pisarro
—abandoned the facts of nature
for their visual sensation.
"Against the fleeting evanescence
of the impressionists, Cezanne erects
the austere, logical standard of the
monumental, the architectonic, and
the pictorially structural.
"Between these two attitudes,
the sensual and the pattern-mak
ing, the issue was joined. Gau
guin, van Gogh and Matisse com
bine them both, but each in re
sponse to the needs of a highly in
dividual personality.
Imagination Flourishes
"Meanwhile, as (he issue of
Cezanne versus Pisarro was be
ing fought out to its various con
clusions. another tendency of art
continued to flourish. This is the
introspective tendency, which
prizes above everything imagi
nation—the inward vision released
from allegiance to the surround
ing world.
"All these things are omnipresent
in one form or another in the art
of the present day. This exhibition
shows in brief where they came
from. It ties today and yesterday
into a continuing unity and suggests,
perhaps, some of the things that
may be happening tomorrow," Mr.
Frankenstein concludes.

volt—spear-headed, so far as this
collection is concerned, by Pisarro
—abandoned the facts of nature
for their visual sensation.
"Against the fleeting evanescence
of the impressionists, Cezanne erects
the austere, logical standard of the
monumental, the architectonic, and
the pictorially structural.
"Between these two attitudes,
the sensual and the pattern-mak
ing, the issue was joined. Gau
guin, van Gogh and Matisse com
bine them both, but each in re
sponse to the needs of a highly in
dividual personality.
Imagination Flourishes
"Meanwhile, as (he issue of
Cezanne versus Pisarro was be
ing fought out to its various con
clusions. another tendency of art
continued to flourish. This is the
introspective tendency, which
prizes above everything imagi
nation—the inward vision released
from allegiance to the surround
ing world.
"All these things are omnipresent
in one form or another in the art
of the present day. This exhibition
shows in brief where they came
from. It ties today and yesterday
into a continuing unity and suggests,
perhaps, some of the things that
may be happening tomorrow," Mr.
Frankenstein concludes.
