## 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 9 (UP). —Premier-designate Baron Ki
juro Shidehara effected a last-minute change in his new 15-man
liberal cabinet today as two major crises confronted the new
government—U.S. seizure of the navy ministry for concealing
war loot and a strike of 6,000 Korean coal miners in Hokkaido.
When the new cabinet members met at the foreign office,
Shidehara announced that Adm. Mitsumasa Yonai, navy minister
since July, 1944, would continue in that post, instead of Adm.
Soemo Toyoda, earlier named for the position.
Daisaburu Tsugita, new chief cabinet secretary, had an
nounced completion of the cabinet earlier and said then that
there had been "difficulty" over the appointment of Toyoda,
commander of the combined Japanese fleet shortly before the
end of the war and undobutedly one of those with knowledge of
the navy's war loot secrets. Toyoda, however, neither "accepted
nor rejected" the post before the new premir announced his
change.
