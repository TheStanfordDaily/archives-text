(This is another in a series of
articles on student government
under the trial-constitution now
in use. This tells of the functions

of Men's and Women's Councils
and their relation to the Funda
mental Standard.)
In Men's and Women's Councils,
judicial bodies of live elected stu
dents, rests the law - enforcement
power behind the legislation of the
A.S.S.U. as well as the Fundamen
tal Standard, including the honor
code, by which Stauford students
are governed.
The councils hear serious viola
tions and also set the rules by which
the smaller women's social regula
tions violations are heard by sub
groups, known as the committees
of six, seven or nine.
Under the new constitution the
functions of council arc principally
unchanged, but its most far-reach
ing body of law, the Fundamental
Standard, receives new treatment.
Law Simplified
For a long time there has been
confusion about the obligations of
the honor code by which Stanford
men and women secure the right
from the University to be respon
sible for the honesty of their aca
demic examinations if the Univer
sity in turn refrains from proctor
ing examinations.
This reciprocal responsibility has
been loosely used in many respects,
and the constitution clarifies the po
sition of the Honor Code by making
it a specific section, under the Fun

damental Standard's general prin
ciples. The Honor Code is .specifi
cally confined to the question of
honest examinations, use of library
materials, and the responsibility of
seeing to it that the provisions of
the code in these rcspects are
obeyed by others.

are governed.
The councils hear serious viola
tions and also set the rules by which
the smaller women's social regula
tions violations are heard by sub
groups, known as the committees
of six, seven or nine.
Under the new constitution the
functions of council arc principally
unchanged, but its most far-reach
ing body of law, the Fundamental
Standard, receives new treatment.
Law Simplified
For a long time there has been
confusion about the obligations of
the honor code by which Stanford
men and women secure the right
from the University to be respon
sible for the honesty of their aca
demic examinations if the Univer
sity in turn refrains from proctor
ing examinations.
This reciprocal responsibility has
been loosely used in many respects,
and the constitution clarifies the po
sition of the Honor Code by making
it a specific section, under the Fun

damental Standard's general prin
ciples. The Honor Code is .specifi
cally confined to the question of
honest examinations, use of library
materials, and the responsibility of
seeing to it that the provisions of
the code in these rcspects are
obeyed by others.

The Fundamental Standard is lhe
statement of conduct made by Dr.
David Starr Jordan thai "Students
are expected to show both within
and without the University such re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens."
Violations of the Fundamental
Standard not falling specifically un
der provisions of the Honor Code
are judged to be violations of the
Fundamental Standard itself, the
new constitution specifically states.
