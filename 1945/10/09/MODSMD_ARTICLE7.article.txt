### 
TIPTONVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 8 (UP).â€”President Truman an
nounced tonight that this country has no intention of telling any
other nation in the world the industrial secret of how to build an
atomic bomb.
The industrial know-how of atomic bomb production will
continue to be a tightly held secret, he told reporters in a front
porch conference at the cottage where he is spending two days
on the short of Reel Foot Lake.
The President made plain that Canada and Great Britain share
our secret and that while he had not discussed with them the
question of making the secret of production available, he was
certain they agreed with his position.
