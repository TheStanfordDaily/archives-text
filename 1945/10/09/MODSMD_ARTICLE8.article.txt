WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 (UP).—The Army's battle deaths in
World War II surpassed those of any conflict in U.S. history even
though advanced medical care brought a remarkable reduction
in deaths among the wounded, Gen. George C. Marshall's bien
nial report showed tonight.
It listed 201,367 soldiers killed—l6o,o4s in Europe and 41,332
in the Pacific—or 150,857 more than in World War I.
"As staggering as our casualties have been," Marshall wrote,
"the enemy forces opposing us suffered many times more heav
ily."
He estimated that 1,592,600 German, Italian and Japanese
troops were killed by American fire, that 303,700 were "perma
nently disabled" and 8,150,477 captured and disarmed.
