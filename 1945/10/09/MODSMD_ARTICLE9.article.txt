dents of all the Row houses will
meet today at 1 p.m. in the Wom
en's Clubhouse with Beatty O'Hair,
vice -chairman of Conference, to
form the ex-committee.
Decide Meeting Times
The presidents will decide who
will compose the Excomâ€”the house
presidents, vice-presidents, or some
other house officer or representative.
They will also decide the time and
frequency of their meetings. Offi
cers will be elected if the girls de
cide the house presidents should be
the members.
Will Set Election Dates
The president of Row Excom will
become a member of Women's Con
ference. The A.S.S.U. Excom rep
resentative from the Row will re
port to the Row Excom, and the
Row Excom will send a representa
tive to Sponsor Choosing and Nom
inating Committees. It will also set
dates for elections in each of the
houses.
Girls were to discuss in their
houses last night the q ucstion of
whether or not they wanted to
have Vocom this year. If they
want it, they should be willing to
support it and offer their sugges
tions for programs. This question
will he discussed further at Con
ference next week.
Room, Board Costs Rise
Marylou McClure, chairman of
Housing Committee, reported that
room and board is about $7.50 high
er than last quarter due to the ris
ing cost of living.' It costs more for
the University to run the Row
houses than it did for the houses
to run themselves because they each
have a dining room which the Uni
versity has to operate. Also soro
rity alumnae donated gifts to the
houses of things that were needed,
and the houses needed repair when
the University took them over.
Housing Committee learned these
facts when it met with Frank Walk
er, financial vice - president; Miss
Anastasia Doyle, assistant Dean of
Women, and John M. Stalnaker,
Dean of Students, last week. A
more detailed report will be printed
later.
Houses this quarter may enter
tain corridors of freshmen. Dur
ing winter quarter, freshmen will
he invited to see all (he houses,
and all the houses will have some
informal entertainment for them.
A program of education will he
given concerning the differences
in the various houses.
The Stanford Mothers' Club will
hold a tea and fashion show some
time this quarter. A model was cho
sen from each house last night and
the girls will model clothes from
Carolyn Kelsey.
Distribute Honor Booklets
Barbara Lamb, chairman of the
Honor Code Standing Committee,
distributed the new honor code
booklets. In the booklets there is
a recommendation that students stay
in the room when taking an exami
nation if possible to avoid suspicion.
Also under Article X of the Consti
tution ,the honor code comes under
the Fundamental Standard and
mostly refers to academic work.
Women's social regulations are sep
arate from the honor code and also
come under the Fundamental
Standard.
Dean Stalnaker was the guest of
Conference. Patty Patten, chair
man of Conference, and Sylvia Da
vis, chairman of Women's Council,
