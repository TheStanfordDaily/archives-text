# Schwartz To Meet Grid Tryouts Today at 4:30
## 100 Men to Seek Varsity Positions; No Definite Word on Contests Yet 
### 
The long-awaited return to varsity sporls becames an actual reality to
day. At 4:30 in Room 41 of the B.A.C. Marchmont Schwartz will greet all
grid candidates. First practice will be limited to blackboard work; plays
will be explained and signals will be run through. Another "classroom
practice" will be held on Thursday, and on Friday equipment will be issued.

One hundred men have signified
their intention of trying out for the
squad. About half of this figure
are N.R.O.T.C. fellows. How many
out of this lot are of varsity timber
is unknown at the moment, but
Schwartz will cast his discerning
eye around for potential Block S
men.

The question of playing some
games keeps cropping up in every
one's mind, but no definite word
is known yet. Mr. Schwartz is con
fident he could field a competent
squad around November, but if
games arc played, all players lose
a year of eligibility, unless some
provision can be made with other
schools in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence—which is hoped can be done
—that informal contests played this
year won't affect future elgibility.

last great Stanford football stars.
Coach Schwartz hopes there's an
other Frankie out for practice this
afternoon.
