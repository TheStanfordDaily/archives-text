# Series Film Wins Favorable Comment; Movie Plot Complex
## Colleen Moore, Henry Walthall, Alan Hale Star in 1934 Psychological Production 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
The imperfect sound and photog
raphy, explainable by the early
date of production (1934), and some
unnecessary comic sideplay, not ex
cusable in this instance, could not
keep "The Scarlet Letter," shown
last night at the Tuesday Scries,
from being an excellent motion pic
ture.
Hollywood then, as now, did its
best to fog up a good plot, but
Hawthorne's masterly story of a
woman who sinned, the man who
betrayed her, and the one who
sought vengeance, was sustained in
several clearly cut, moving, highly
dramatic scenes, which, curiously
enough, though reminiscent of stage
acting, were not dragged out as
emotional scenes usually are in the
movies.
Hester Prynne, played by Colleen
Moore, is a Puritan woman of 1642,

who has been branded with the
scarlet letter "A" for adultery and
refuses to divulge the name of the
father of her child. The man, played
by Henry B. Walthall, is the pastor
of the colony, a revered and
"saintly man."
Hester's husband, who is sup
posed to* be dead, appears at the
moment when Hester is being ac
cused, conceals his identity, and as
sumes a secure position as the pas
tor's doctor. He swears vengeance
on Hester's betrayer and when his
suspicions are confirmed that the
pastor is his victim he maliciously
remains silent but hounds him con
stantly with insinuations and lead
ing remarks.
The pastor falls ill under the
pressure of his own conscience and
in the final scene, upon the scaffold
where Hester was accused, con
fesses and dies in peace.
This, in brief, was the story, as
shown in the film. It did not, of
course, reveal all the psychological
effects Hester's guilt had upon her,
nor the Reverend Hinsdale's men
tal tortures, though his character
was slightly better portrayed, pos
sibly becausc it was more active,
than hers.
In the reviewer's opinion, the
best scene was that in which the
pastor, already a sick man, comes
out on a stormy night, gets up on
the scaffold and is about to give
himself up to his God, if not first
to the people, when Hester appears,
restrains him, and her husband
overhears. The fakey lightning and
thunder did not mar the drama.
Also good was the pastor's ser
mon scene when his feeling of hy
pocrisy is most evident.
Alan Hale's horseplay with his
little stooge is very out of place
and his misinterpreted John Alden
wooing is a secondary story which
should not have been thrown in.
The picture was produced by Ma
jestic Films and directed by Charles
G. Vignola.
