# Do You Want a Band, Indians? Tryout Now
## Stanford Needs Pre-War Musicians For Basketball, Football Seasons 
### BOB PECK 
If Stanford wants a school band for the basketball games this winter, the
rallies this spring, and most important of all, football in 1946, more civilians
must try out.
When the army leaves in December, 32 members of the 49 piece band
will leave Stanford. These positions have got to be filled by navy men

and civilians.
Beat Cal!
In January when the "Beat Cal"
sign is out and "Konko the Bronco"
is being passed around, the basket
ball pavillion is going to be the place
to be. And to knock the Blue and
Gold invaders right back to shamb
ley Berkeley, Stanford needs a snap
py band that can give with "Come
Join the Band" at the right time.
The University has a hundred
snappy red and white band uni
forms ready for the first basketball
game, but, first, they need some
body to wear them.
Band Famous
Stanford in the past has always
been famous for its school band,
whether it be playing in Seattle or
the Rose Bowl. Between the halves
at the big football games, the band
performed intricate tricks on the
floor of the stadium. On Los Ange
les trips to beat S.C. or Rose Bowl
iaunts, the band has always exempli
fied the Stanford spirit. Wherever
Stanford's fame has spread through
out the nation, "Come Join the
Band" and "Sons of the Stanford
Red" echoed the sentiments of the
Farm.
But, this is 1945! We're just about
to launch our return to athletics.
Basketball practice is underway.
Coach Marchie is back and football
cleats are sounding around the
Farm. But this is 1945, and we'll
have no band when the army leaves!
Navy Included
In previous years the band has
always been a men's civilian organi
zation; now navy boys and girls
have been admitted along with En
cina's army. If we are to have spirit
at the games and the rallies, if you
want California to hear the Cardinal
victory song, it's you who has to
support it.
The University has the instru
ments; the University has the uni
forms. The University will even give
you credit units for band practice.
Practice hours are between 7 and
9 p.m. on Mondays, only two hours
a week.
Gelber Is Director
New director of the band this year
is Max Gelber, music and orchestra
director at Sequoia high school. Mr.
Gelber has studied abroad, in Aus
tria, and did his graduate work
here at Stanford. He doesn't let it
be known, but his undergraduate
study was at California.
Stressing the point that more ci
vilians must turn out, Mr. Gelber
gloomily says that if more fellows
and girls don't try out on one of
the next Monday nights, the band
will have to be disbanded for this
year. That would be a lot of support
for the basketball team, now,
wouldn't it?
