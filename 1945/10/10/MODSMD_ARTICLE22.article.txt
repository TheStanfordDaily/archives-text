Nations, like people, often do guestionable
things under the guise of necessity. This week
v/f j learn that British occupational forces in the
Netherlands East Indies may be keeping /apan
cse forces under arms, presumably as cold
Water to throw upon any fiery nationalist out
burst until new Allied troops arrive to assume
command of the situation.
The nationalists of Java and other Dutch-con
trolled islands are those who have steadily
raised protest, since Japanese rule was lifted,
against a return to their prewar status as colo
nies. While British troops moved in to oust the
Japanese, the nationalists hoped for a chance to
oust their "liberators," and establish an Indo
nesian republic before Dutch authorities iteturn
and take over.
As reports come in that ships loaded with
Dutch troops are on their way to the East Indies,
the nationalists threaten to fight the first con
tingents ashore. Meanwhile, signs appear in the
Java streets, "Better to hell than to colonial
again," and a Netherlands official attempts to
alleviate the situation with a statement that
"complete independence, but an independenoe
not based upon violence or terrorism," can be
achieved.
British occupational forces, in the hot spot,
therefore are in the position of maintaining
peace until mediation begins between the col
onials and their mother nation. It appears that
they have failed in their position of responsibil
ity as representatives of all free nations, if they
have indeed used mobilized Japanese troops as
a threat to the proponents of an Indonesian re
public. Without sympathizing with either the
nationalist cause or with the Netherlands' col
onial policy, one can say that the British move
does not look like any sort of fair play.—N.S.
