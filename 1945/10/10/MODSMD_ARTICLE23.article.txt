This department, along with many others, is
most happy over the recent developments con
cerning treatment of returning veterans on cam
pus. The good feature about this is the fact that
many of the veterans' problems are applicable
to the majority of studentsâ€”housing, registra
tion simplification, etc. Another joy note was
the announcement that entrance reguirements
will be raised.
It is our feeling that grade point reguirements
throughout the University should be raised ap
preciably. For example, many Stanford stu
dents and faculty members have been irritated
no end at the safe fortress upper division stand
ing affords. At present, no upper division stu
dent may be flunked out of school, regardless
of his grade point average. If a student slides
into upper division he may take the rest of his
life to finish college no matter how far he slips
in his courses. It is more than a little embar
rassing to me when a rival school alumnus
tells me the story of a friend of his who flunked
out of a second rate college and yet was per
mitted to enter Stanford. What kind of respect
must that student have for the scholastic stand
ing of Stanford?
Many freshmen enrolled at Stanford summer
quarter with the hope they would be permitted
to return this fall. Only a few of them were al
lowed to re-enroll. At present many freshmen
men and women are living off campus. It is
only fair to them, and the University, to reside
in Stanford living groups. It will be admitted the
housing situation is acute for all. Why not clean
out some of the sub-standard students, who are
minus to an appreciable degree, and make room
for students who wish to attend college to learn
something? After this element is eradicated, the
entrance examination would automatically bring
in students of a high calibre and the lower and
upper divisions would be on a scholastic par.
Your writer feels it is a matter of Stanford pride
and satisfaction, if nothing else.
Tonight is the last showing of Wonder Man,
featuring Danny Kaye, at the Paly flick. If you

haven't seen it, forget that paper that's due to
morrow and take it in. It is my contention that
Wonder Man is the best thing that has come
along since Lana Turner began wearing sweat
ers.

And then there is the story of the Roble girl
who phoned the Stanford Fire Department and
reported that a man was trying to enter her
window on the second floor. When the lad on
the other end of the phone declared the girl
had made a mistake and that "this isn't the
Police Department, but the Fire Department,"
she impatiently replied, "I know that. It's the
Fire Department I'm after. The fellow needs a
longer ladder."

Mary Lou Patton, Gaieties director, was in
terrupted the other day by a friend who burst
in and said there was a graduate student who
insisted upon seeing her immediately, concern
ing a part in the forthcoming show. "What does
he do?" asked Miss Patton. "He tells me he
specializes in sticking his right arm into the
mouth of a lion." "Sounds interesting," said
the director, "What does he call himself?" . . .
"Lefty," said her friend.
