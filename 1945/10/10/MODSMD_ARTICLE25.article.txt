Defense to the atom bomb? Share the atom
bomb? These questions are the most vital to
us today, because they add up —to badly para
phrase Shakespeare—to be blown to bits or not
to?
Scientists discussing the problem say that, so
far, the only defense is to destroy the means by
which the explosive is carried. The Crosby Re
search Foundation puts forth a claim that there
is another block to this blow, but it has not pub
lished anything, and its work thus cannot be
commented on.
A A DEFENSE
Until Crosby starts hitting the technical maga
zines, the best way to approach the problem is
from knocking down air transports. So far, the
only vehicle used has been the bomber, and a
defense might soon be found for this.
First of all, AA tactics against high flying
planes were just coming out of their technicolo
gical infancy when the war ended. Radar coula
always spot them, and electronic calculators
could plot their course, but the old time shells
had too low a velocity to get up to that altitude
in time.
NEW A A GUNS
We had—but had little occasion to use—a 120
mm. AA gun that was the best in its field, and
the laps were about to mass produce a 150 mm.
weapon that was a close competitor. Also, ra
dar-operated fuses certainly helped decrease the
effects of inaccuracy of the pieces at such long
ranges. The net result of all this was that 100
out of 104 fast-moving, high-flying German
V-2s were knocked out on their way over Eng
land.
But this is not the end of it. The Germans were
on their way to an AA rocket that would get up
to 50,000 feet so fast that a bomber would have
no chance of outmaneuvering it.
With conventional bombers eliminated as a
weapon, though, we still have the problem of
stratosphere rockets and jet propelled planes.
These can progress to unlimited speeds, and
perhaps in the next war will move at much
more than 1,000 miles an hour.
Yet they are not maneuverable because of
their speeds, and predictor sights could track
them better than a slower plane in which a pilot
had time to adjust his reflexes to the situation.
The guestion here is one of better rocket fuels
for the defenders, to get their missies up fast
enough.
But still there is the possibility of space rock
ets or space bombers for the attackers, planes
which could follow a radar beam up through
the heaviside layer and almost to the end of the
earth's gravitational pull, then drop down and
drive towards a city. These would gain almost
fantastic velocities in their dives, but still they
might be handled by guns trained on a certain
level where the aerial burst would not do dam
age, and which would go off automatically as
soon as their radar detected an unfriendly body.
With all these solutions, though, there is still
the mathematical certainty that something
would get through. But still a secret revetment
system for jet bombs that the enemy knew
nothing about would make him think twice be
fore using atomic bombs, and, since the explos
ion tends to billow up, it is highly possible that
by duplicating your industrial structure under
ground, you could make your enemy's efforts
indecisive. The Germans showed that the latter
was possible; even during the final stages of the
war, when their industry was shattered, they
built large locomotive factories four miles un
der.
In conclusion, the fear of retaliation might
make an aggressor think along more concen
tional lines than atom bombs, but, even if he
should not, it will not be completely impossible
to fight bark defensively, as well as offensively.

A A DEFENSE
Until Crosby starts hitting the technical maga
zines, the best way to approach the problem is
from knocking down air transports. So far, the
only vehicle used has been the bomber, and a
defense might soon be found for this.
First of all, AA tactics against high flying
planes were just coming out of their technicolo
gical infancy when the war ended. Radar coula
always spot them, and electronic calculators
could plot their course, but the old time shells
had too low a velocity to get up to that altitude
in time.

We had—but had little occasion to use—a 120

the laps were about to mass produce a 150 mm.
weapon that was a close competitor. Also, ra
dar-operated fuses certainly helped decrease the
effects of inaccuracy of the pieces at such long
ranges. The net result of all this was that 100
out of 104 fast-moving, high-flying German
V-2s were knocked out on their way over Eng
land.
But this is not the end of it. The Germans were
on their way to an AA rocket that would get up
to 50,000 feet so fast that a bomber would have
no chance of outmaneuvering it.
With conventional bombers eliminated as a
weapon, though, we still have the problem of
stratosphere rockets and jet propelled planes.
These can progress to unlimited speeds, and
perhaps in the next war will move at much
more than 1,000 miles an hour.
Yet they are not maneuverable because of
their speeds, and predictor sights could track
them better than a slower plane in which a pilot
had time to adjust his reflexes to the situation.
The guestion here is one of better rocket fuels
for the defenders, to get their missies up fast
enough.
But still there is the possibility of space rock
ets or space bombers for the attackers, planes
which could follow a radar beam up through
the heaviside layer and almost to the end of the
earth's gravitational pull, then drop down and
drive towards a city. These would gain almost
fantastic velocities in their dives, but still they
might be handled by guns trained on a certain
level where the aerial burst would not do dam
age, and which would go off automatically as
soon as their radar detected an unfriendly body.
With all these solutions, though, there is still
the mathematical certainty that something
would get through. But still a secret revetment
system for jet bombs that the enemy knew
nothing about would make him think twice be
