# Congress Urged to Set Up Nine-Man Atomic Group
## Groves Emphasizes Potential Good In Development by Civilian Hands 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.—(UP).—
Maj. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, director
of the army's $2,000,000,000 (B)
atomic bomb project, today urged
Congress to set up a commission for
atomic development because "we're
flirting with national suicide if this
thing gets out of control."
Appearing at House Military Af
fairs Committee hearings on legis
lation to establish a nine-man con
trol commission, Groves said the
rest of the world will require "a
number of years" to catch up with
American progress in the field of
atomic energy.
"We're ahead now," he said.
"They can catch us. It's going to
take time but I don't know how
long."
Patterson Testifies
He and Secretary of War Robert
P. Patterson testified after President
Truman reiterated that the United
States would not share the "know
how ' of making the atomic bomb.
Patterson, likewise, pledged for
transfer of atomic control and de
velopment from the army to scien
tific civilian hands .
"If," he said, "we misapply the
knowledge we now have or fail to
carry forward our research with the
utmost vigor, we may be passing
a sentence of death on the future
of our own country and the entire
world.
Groves Stresses Menace
"The atomic bomb is the most
devastating weapon we know, but
the means of releasing atomic en
ergy which it employes may prove
to be the greatest boon to man
kind in the world's history. The
wisest minds in our nation will be
required to administer this discov
ery for the benefit of all of us."
Groves stressed the atom's po
tential menace as well as its poten
tial good.
"In irresponsible hands," he said,
"the power of the atom might de
stroy the world. Properly develop
ed and properly administered this

same force can help light the way
to a future of lasting peace and
prosperity for all the people of the
world."
Co-Worker Speaks
Despite Mr. Truman's reassurance
at Tiptonville, Tenn,, some commit
tee members expressed concern that
the pending legislation does not pro
hibit him from giving the bomb
secret away if he finds that course
advisable. Groves admitted the
measure would give the president
that power.
Two of Groves' co-workers on the
atomic bomb project—Dr. Vannevar
Bush, director of the Office of Scien
tific Research and Development,
and Dr .James Bryant Conant,
Harvard University president
pleaded for prompt passage.

States would not share the "know
how ' of making the atomic bomb.
Patterson, likewise, pledged for
transfer of atomic control and de
velopment from the army to scien

"If," he said, "we misapply the
knowledge we now have or fail to
carry forward our research with the
utmost vigor, we may be passing
a sentence of death on the future
of our own country and the entire
world.
Groves Stresses Menace
"The atomic bomb is the most
devastating weapon we know, but
the means of releasing atomic en
ergy which it employes may prove
to be the greatest boon to man
kind in the world's history. The
wisest minds in our nation will be
required to administer this discov
ery for the benefit of all of us."
Groves stressed the atom's po
tential menace as well as its poten
tial good.
"In irresponsible hands," he said,
"the power of the atom might de
stroy the world. Properly develop
ed and properly administered this

same force can help light the way
to a future of lasting peace and
prosperity for all the people of the
world."
Co-Worker Speaks
Despite Mr. Truman's reassurance
at Tiptonville, Tenn,, some commit
tee members expressed concern that
the pending legislation does not pro
hibit him from giving the bomb
secret away if he finds that course
advisable. Groves admitted the
measure would give the president
that power.
Two of Groves' co-workers on the
atomic bomb project—Dr. Vannevar
Bush, director of the Office of Scien

WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.—(UP).—
Maj. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, director
of the army's $2,000,000,000 (B)
atomic bomb project, today urged
Congress to set up a commission for
atomic development because "we're
flirting with national suicide if this
thing gets out of control."
Appearing at House Military Af
fairs Committee hearings on legis
lation to establish a nine-man con
trol commission, Groves said the
rest of the world will require "a
number of years" to catch up with
American progress in the field of
atomic energy.
"We're ahead now," he said.
"They can catch us. It's going to
take time but I don't know how
long."
