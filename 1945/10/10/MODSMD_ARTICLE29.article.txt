'"I used to be a strong believer
in state educational institutions,"
declared Professor Anatole G. Maz
our, visiting teacher in the School
j of Humanities, "but after many years
of experience, 112 believe that there
is an important place in America
for private education." Professor
Mazour added that his observations
of Stanford have convinced him of
this fact more than ever.
The visiting professor is teaching
Russian and Russian history. His
interest in history is social and cul
tural, and he believes that many
people devote too much attention
to politics and do not seem to know
if Russia existed before 1!)17. In his
classes, Professor Mazour tries to
bring out the forgotten cultural
background of thai country.
Bikes Reminiscent of Denmark
The native Russian has taught at
the University of California, Miami,
Nevada, and, in 1935, at Stanford.

When asked about any visible
changes in the Farm since his last
visit here, the professor emphatic
ally emphasized the predominence
of women on the campus. He added
that the numerous bikes remind him
of Denmark.
At this point in the interview,
Professor Mazour smiled and noted
that he had been reading the Daily
articles written by veterans. He ad
ded that professors can have just
as much difficulty as returning serv
ice men. The Professor and his wife
will have to vacate their apartment
on November 1, and they are fran
tically searching for a home. He
declared that he is quiet, has "great
respect for property," and would ap
preciate a "free plug."
Pacific Important
Professor Mazour observed that
since the Pacific is beginning to play
an important role in world peace,
and since the powers of the United
States and Russia are growing, it

is important to devote attention to
this area, which has remarkable pos
sibilities. He further stated that on
the Pacific we have an excellent
cultural base because of two great
libraries. He believes that the Uni
versity of California and Hoover
libraries are outstanding and equal
to those in the East.
The Professor is making use of
these collections to write his new
book, a cultural history of modern
Russia due to be published next
year.
Books Listed
Among his other works are a
book on the Decembrist Movement
of 1925, a Russian historiography,
and several short articles. Profes
sor Mazour emphasized the import'
ance of the Hoover Library in fin
ishing his latest book.
This, graduate of Yale University
is a veteran of the Russian army of
the First World War. He traveled
a great deal in Europe before com
ing to the United States in 192.1.
Even though he now compares Stan
ford to a second Smith or Vassal - ,
Professor Mazour likes being back
in this "familiar place."
