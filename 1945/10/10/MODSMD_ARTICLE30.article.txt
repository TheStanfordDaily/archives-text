# 'Wonder Man' Falls Short of Expectations; Double Dose of Danny Doesn't Save Picture
## 
### 
This afternoon and evening, "Won- j
der Man" and "Bedside Manner"
at the Stanford.
A lot of people who saw "Wonder
Man" were reminded of scenes in
Danny Kaye's "Up in Arms," but

nostalgia wasn't
enough to put
th e audience
anywhere near
the aisles. Per
il ap s advance
publicity made
the audience ex
pect too much
from the second
Danny Kaye
picture.
There were a

couple of really funny sequences,
but the sensitive movie-goer was
almost embarrassed to find Danny
Kaye trying so hard with so little
effect. It missed being hilarious by i
about three lagging routines.
Possibly working on the theory !
of doubling laughs, Danny Kaye was
"super-identical twins." One, a
brash night-club comic, Buzzy Bel
low, the other studious Edwin Din
gle—a scholar of such genius that
he wrote with both hands at the
same time in order to write faster.
Buzzy Murdered
Buzzy, supposed to testify at a !
murder trial, is murdered himself J
and thrown into a pond. Of course }

he contacts his long-lost twin, Mr.
Dingle, and the poor scholar reacts
in astounding ways.
The high point of the show comes
when Edwin Dingle, chased by two
mobsters, finds himself on the op
era stage. He and the soprano exe
cute some amazing duets before Ed
win finally gives the district attor- j
ney his information.
Afraid of Women
Also good is a library scene where
Edwin is invited to a literary tea
and refuses because he has "octra
phobia"—fear— of women.
With "Wonder Man" at the Stan
ford is "Bedside Manner." The plot,
old, but always good, would have
been funny if Cary Grant and Rosa
lind Russell had had the lines. As
it was, Ruth Hussy and John Car

roll just limped along.
Miss Hussy, a psychiatrist, has
Carroll as a patient. She discovers
he is using trumped-up symptoms
only as an excuse to consult her, is
properly furious, and ends up in a
final clinch. Nuff said.—Ayres.

This afternoon and evening, "Won- j
der Man" and "Bedside Manner"
at the Stanford.
A lot of people who saw "Wonder
Man" were reminded of scenes in
Danny Kaye's "Up in Arms," but

nostalgia wasn't
enough to put
th e audience
anywhere near
the aisles. Per
il ap s advance
publicity made
the audience ex
pect too much
from the second
Danny Kaye
picture.
There were a

couple of really funny sequences,
but the sensitive movie-goer was
almost embarrassed to find Danny
Kaye trying so hard with so little
effect. It missed being hilarious by i
about three lagging routines.
Possibly working on the theory !
of doubling laughs, Danny Kaye was
"super-identical twins." One, a
brash night-club comic, Buzzy Bel
low, the other studious Edwin Din
gle—a scholar of such genius that
he wrote with both hands at the
same time in order to write faster.
Buzzy Murdered
Buzzy, supposed to testify at a !
murder trial, is murdered himself J
and thrown into a pond. Of course }

he contacts his long-lost twin, Mr.
Dingle, and the poor scholar reacts
in astounding ways.
The high point of the show comes
when Edwin Dingle, chased by two
mobsters, finds himself on the op
era stage. He and the soprano exe
cute some amazing duets before Ed
win finally gives the district attor- j
ney his information.
