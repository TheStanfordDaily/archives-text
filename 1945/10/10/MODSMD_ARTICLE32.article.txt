# Tigers 5-4 Favorites
## Newhouser Faces Borowy In Deciding Contest today 
### OSCAR FRALEY United Press Sports Writer 
CHICAGO, Oet. 9 (UP). —Hal Newhouser of the Detroit Tigers and
Hank Borowy of the Chicago Cubs, two tough guys in the clutch, were
all set tonight to square off tomorrow in the payoff game of the 1945
World Series.
Newhouser, the major leagues' leading winner with 25 victories during
the regular campaign, made the Tigers a four to three favorite to win the
seventh and deciding contest of the richest baseball classic of all time.
But those Tigers, who blew a 12th-inning decision yesterday to
square the series at three games all, knew this Borowy was no pushover.
He beat them—and Newhouser—by a 9 to 0 count in the opening game;
lasted but live innings in losing the fifth game which put the Detroiters
in front, and then went into yesterday's crucial contest in the ninth
inning to be declared the victor in the 12th when Stan Hack hammered
the hit which sent pinch-runner Billy Schuster in with the deciding
tally.
Hank always has been tough for the Tigers in the many times he faced
them before being waived out of the American League in midseason.
He beat the Tigers 11 times in the American League, while losing to
ihem but three times.
It was a real surprise when Manager Charley Grimm of the Cubs today
named Borowy to open this deciding contest when the teams take to the
diamond at Wrigley Field at 1:30 p.m. E.S.T. tomorrow. For Fordham Hank
pitched four tense and tiring innings westerday, with the series pot of
gold riding on every slant, and Grimm was expected to come back tomor
row with Paul Derringer.
But Hank got the nod, despite those nine winning innings in last Wed
nesday's opener at Detroit; his five-inning kayo Sunday in Chicago, and
that back-breaking, nerve-shattering four-inning job yesterday.
And now he has a chance to equal the record of three victories against
one defeat which only three men have accomplished. They were Bill
Dineen of the Red Sox in 1993; Smoky Joe Wood of the Red Sox in 1912,
and Urban (Red) Faber of the White Sox in 1917. It would be a terrific
windup for the thin-faced Polish boy from Bloomfield, N.J.
Yet the Detroiters figured that their home-town star, the lean and
wiry Newhouser with the left-handed fast ball, would blow down those
Cubs. The pressure of his first World Sei'ies appearance smacked him
down in the opening game of the classic, but he steadied to come back
and take the filth from the man who had beaten him.

Meanwhile, the first seven-game
series since 1940 promised a bulging
crowd of more than 43,000, which
would shatter the all-time seven
game attendance record of 328,051
set in 1926 by the New York Yan
kees and the St. Louis Cardinals.
Ticket sales were heavy on this off
day and all but two of the ticket
booths at the stadium, where they
went on sale at 9 a.m. today, were
closed by 10:30 a.m.
The gate receipts, plus radio
rights, already totaled a staggering
$1,388,277 and the pool was ex
pected to reach a record $1,600,000.
Neither club met today for a
workout with the temperature in
the low 40's and frost predicted for
tonight with a low of 32. But the
weatherman promised clear skies
tomorrow, along with a light wind,
and temperatures which would
reach 62 in the afternoon.
Back of Newhouser for Detroit
the big ones are Virgil Trucks and
Dizzy Trout. Trucks was batted out
in yesterday's fifth inning and Trout
was the loser after pitching five in
nings in dropping the 8 to 7 decision
which evened the series at three
games each.

Hank always has been tough for the Tigers in the many times he faced
them before being waived out of the American League in midseason.
He beat the Tigers 11 times in the American League, while losing to
ihem but three times.
It was a real surprise when Manager Charley Grimm of the Cubs today
named Borowy to open this deciding contest when the teams take to the
diamond at Wrigley Field at 1:30 p.m. E.S.T. tomorrow. For Fordham Hank
pitched four tense and tiring innings westerday, with the series pot of
gold riding on every slant, and Grimm was expected to come back tomor
row with Paul Derringer.
But Hank got the nod, despite those nine winning innings in last Wed
nesday's opener at Detroit; his five-inning kayo Sunday in Chicago, and
that back-breaking, nerve-shattering four-inning job yesterday.
And now he has a chance to equal the record of three victories against
one defeat which only three men have accomplished. They were Bill
Dineen of the Red Sox in 1993; Smoky Joe Wood of the Red Sox in 1912,
and Urban (Red) Faber of the White Sox in 1917. It would be a terrific
windup for the thin-faced Polish boy from Bloomfield, N.J.
Yet the Detroiters figured that their home-town star, the lean and
wiry Newhouser with the left-handed fast ball, would blow down those
Cubs. The pressure of his first World Sei'ies appearance smacked him
down in the opening game of the classic, but he steadied to come back
and take the filth from the man who had beaten him.

Meanwhile, the first seven-game
series since 1940 promised a bulging
crowd of more than 43,000, which
would shatter the all-time seven
game attendance record of 328,051
set in 1926 by the New York Yan
kees and the St. Louis Cardinals.
Ticket sales were heavy on this off
day and all but two of the ticket
booths at the stadium, where they
went on sale at 9 a.m. today, were
closed by 10:30 a.m.
The gate receipts, plus radio
rights, already totaled a staggering
$1,388,277 and the pool was ex
pected to reach a record $1,600,000.
Neither club met today for a
workout with the temperature in
the low 40's and frost predicted for
tonight with a low of 32. But the
weatherman promised clear skies
tomorrow, along with a light wind,
and temperatures which would
reach 62 in the afternoon.
Back of Newhouser for Detroit
the big ones are Virgil Trucks and
Dizzy Trout. Trucks was batted out
in yesterday's fifth inning and Trout
was the loser after pitching five in
nings in dropping the 8 to 7 decision
which evened the series at three
games each.
CHICAGO, Oet. 9 (UP). —Hal Newhouser of the Detroit Tigers and
Hank Borowy of the Chicago Cubs, two tough guys in the clutch, were
all set tonight to square off tomorrow in the payoff game of the 1945
World Series.
Newhouser, the major leagues' leading winner with 25 victories during
the regular campaign, made the Tigers a four to three favorite to win the
seventh and deciding contest of the richest baseball classic of all time.
But those Tigers, who blew a 12th-inning decision yesterday to
square the series at three games all, knew this Borowy was no pushover.
He beat them—and Newhouser—by a 9 to 0 count in the opening game;
lasted but live innings in losing the fifth game which put the Detroiters
in front, and then went into yesterday's crucial contest in the ninth
inning to be declared the victor in the 12th when Stan Hack hammered
the hit which sent pinch-runner Billy Schuster in with the deciding
tally.
