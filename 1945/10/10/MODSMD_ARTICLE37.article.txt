It looks as if the bay area is now
supporting two of the better foot
ball teams on the coast, and possibly
one oi the best in the nation. Cali
fornia's victory over Washington
last Saturday brought the bears up
the football ladder. St. Mary's vic
tory over the much publicised
Wolves from Neva6a increased the
standing of the Gaels.
The Galloping Gaels from Moraga.
in their game against Nevada, proved
that they could hold off and push
back a line of heavy and powerful
men. Wedemeyer and Co. have
now come up against all kinds of
competition and have proved them
selves worthy of all the publicity
given them.
Only 13 Points Off Gaels
In three games the Gaels have
scored 85 points against their op
ponents' 13 which proves that they
are strong on both offense and de
fense If Jimmy Phelan wishes he
can probably make a scoring record
when he plays Stagg's Pacific team
this Saturday.
Although St. Mary's was placed
way dcwn on the list of the na
tions ranking teams, 19th to be ex
act, our belief is that they should
be a lot closer to the top than that.
If they defeat U.S.C. when they play
them at the Colesium a week from
next Saturday, and they have an
even chance of doing this, then they
will probably be moved up into the
top five teams in the nation.
Bears Have Added Power •
The Golden Bears proved, in their
game against Washington, that all
they lacked to make an A-l ball
club were a few good backfield men.
With the addition to the back
field last Saturday of Bill Agnew
and Bud Buestad, both returned
war veterans, the Cal squad really
showed what it could do. This week
end when the Bears face UCLA they
will have another addition to the
backfield in the person of Ted Ken
field.
Kenfield's punishment for his part

in the Ax stealing attempt came to
an end last weekend, and he will
be ready to play against the Bruins
next Saturday. Kenfield played as
a frdsh at Nebraska three years ago,
and is rated as the best running
back the Bears have besides being an
excellent kicker and passer.

one oi the best in the nation. Cali
fornia's victory over Washington
last Saturday brought the bears up
the football ladder. St. Mary's vic
tory over the much publicised
Wolves from Neva6a increased the
standing of the Gaels.
The Galloping Gaels from Moraga.
in their game against Nevada, proved
that they could hold off and push
back a line of heavy and powerful
men. Wedemeyer and Co. have
now come up against all kinds of
competition and have proved them
selves worthy of all the publicity
given them.
Only 13 Points Off Gaels
In three games the Gaels have
scored 85 points against their op
ponents' 13 which proves that they
are strong on both offense and de
fense If Jimmy Phelan wishes he
can probably make a scoring record
when he plays Stagg's Pacific team
this Saturday.
Although St. Mary's was placed
way dcwn on the list of the na
tions ranking teams, 19th to be ex
act, our belief is that they should
be a lot closer to the top than that.
If they defeat U.S.C. when they play
them at the Colesium a week from
next Saturday, and they have an
even chance of doing this, then they
will probably be moved up into the
top five teams in the nation.
Bears Have Added Power •
The Golden Bears proved, in their
game against Washington, that all
they lacked to make an A-l ball
club were a few good backfield men.
With the addition to the back
field last Saturday of Bill Agnew
and Bud Buestad, both returned
war veterans, the Cal squad really
showed what it could do. This week
end when the Bears face UCLA they
will have another addition to the
backfield in the person of Ted Ken
field.
Kenfield's punishment for his part

in the Ax stealing attempt came to
an end last weekend, and he will
be ready to play against the Bruins
next Saturday. Kenfield played as
a frdsh at Nebraska three years ago,
and is rated as the best running
back the Bears have besides being an
excellent kicker and passer.
It looks as if the bay area is now
supporting two of the better foot
ball teams on the coast, and possibly
one oi the best in the nation. Cali
