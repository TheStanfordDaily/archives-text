# Grid Roundup

### United Press 
RENO, Nev., Oct. 9. —Santa Bar
bara Marines, originally scheduled
as a "breather" on the University of
Nevada grid slate, now appear to
be one of the tougher foes on the
Wolfpack slate, Coach Jim Aiken
said today.
The Marines have a record of
three games won, none lost and
one tied while scoring 110 points to
the opposition's 19. The Leather
necks whipped the Stockton Com
mandos by the same score as did
St. Mary's — 26-0. The Gaels
drubbed Nevada last Sunday, 39-0.
