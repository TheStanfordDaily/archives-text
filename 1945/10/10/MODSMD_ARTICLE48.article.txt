# Cressey Tells Farm Of Far East Travels
## Visiting Professor Mixes Wanderlust With Study of China's People, Culture 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Professor George B. Cressey is
not the first pioneer of his family,
nor was he the first to visit China.
Captain Josiah Cressey commanded

the "Flying Cloud" on her record
making trip around Cape Horn in
1851. And from San Francisco he
sailed his famous Clipper ship to
the port of Canton for a cargo of
tea and silk.
Dr. Cressey thus inherited a love
of adventure and pushed inland
from the seaports of Asia to the
heart of the continent.
As he himself says,"I like to see
how people live and why. The
more desolate their environment,
and the drier the landscape, the
more I enjoy it." He proved his
convictions in 1924 when he travelled
on foot from Peiping to Tibet, a
journey of 109 days.
Itickshaws No Luxury
Since his first long hike through
China, Dr. Cressey has tried all the
traditional Chinese means of trans
portation and reports that the most
comfortable way to travel by rick
shaw is to get out and walk.
He has travelled the war torn
Burma Road in U.S. jeeps and in
Chinese buses that have had no re
placed parts for ten years. Thirty
seven people may crowd into a six
man bus to beat all San Francisco
records. The drivers have no gaso
line; they use alcohol substitutes or
even charcoal burners. They have
no jacks to change the daily flat
tires, and more than one telephone
pole has served as a lever in the
hands of stranded passengers.
War Hazards
Wartime danger is no myth to
Dr. Ciessey. He has lived through
several air raids, and last year he
sailed only 17 miles from the Jap
anese lines in a junk whose ragged
sails could hardly catch the wind.
"We Americans don't know total
war," he says. "But China and the
Soviet Union do." Many of their
cities have been bombed almost out
of existence, and their shortage of
consumer goods is tragic. Chinese
inflation is unbelievable, and the
government has been powerless to
stop it. It emptied its treasury for
war materials and no longer has a
foreign trade to tax for revenue.
Income taxes are comparatively new
in China, and the country is too
poorly organized to make them
practical.
Tourist With Purpose
China is a land that Dr. Cressey
knows intimately. For he did not
visit Asia as a mere tourist; he went
there to study the people first hand
after many previous years of text
book acquainanee with them. He
taught six years at the University
of Shanghai, meanwhile observing
the nation's mining, manufacturing,
and agriculture. In 1934 he served
as consultant to China's National
Agricultural Research Bureau. In
1937 he was also consultant to the
Soviet government.
His last visit to Asia was in 1944
when he was sent to China by the
Division of Cultural Cooperation of
the United States Department of
State.
Professor Cressey has not confined
himself to China though. He has
studied the entire continent of Asia,
including India and the U.S.S.R. And
his adventures could fill many
books.
Swift Home Coming
His last return to the United
State was rapid, even though he
flew around thi*ee quarters of the
world to avoid the Pacific theater
of war. After crossing Soviet Mid
dle Asia, he left Casablanca one
afternoon and lunched the next day
at La Guardia Field in New York.
He was allowed only thirty pounds
of luggage including K rations,
which left little space for souvenirs.
But his notes weighed little; and
colorful mementos of China were
recorded on Kodachrome film which
preceded him by "official channels."
Three Books
From impressions gathered in his
many years of Asiatic travel, Dr.
Cressey has written three books,
"China's Geographic Foundation,"
"Asia's Lands and Peoples" (which
has been translated into Chinese
and Spanish), and"The Basis of
Soviet Strength" which was re
leased this year by the McGraw Hill
Book Company.
Stanford will have Dr. Cressey for
one year as visiting professor, then
he cxpects to return to Syracuse
University where he is Chairman of
the department of Geography.

visit Asia as a mere tourist; he went
there to study the people first hand
after many previous years of text
book acquainanee with them. He
taught six years at the University
of Shanghai, meanwhile observing
the nation's mining, manufacturing,
and agriculture. In 1934 he served
as consultant to China's National
Agricultural Research Bureau. In
1937 he was also consultant to the
Soviet government.
His last visit to Asia was in 1944
when he was sent to China by the
Division of Cultural Cooperation of
the United States Department of
State.
Professor Cressey has not confined
himself to China though. He has
studied the entire continent of Asia,
including India and the U.S.S.R. And
his adventures could fill many
books.
Swift Home Coming
His last return to the United
State was rapid, even though he
flew around thi*ee quarters of the
world to avoid the Pacific theater
of war. After crossing Soviet Mid
dle Asia, he left Casablanca one
afternoon and lunched the next day
at La Guardia Field in New York.
He was allowed only thirty pounds
of luggage including K rations,
which left little space for souvenirs.
But his notes weighed little; and
colorful mementos of China were
recorded on Kodachrome film which
preceded him by "official channels."
Three Books
From impressions gathered in his
many years of Asiatic travel, Dr.
Cressey has written three books,
"China's Geographic Foundation,"
"Asia's Lands and Peoples" (which
has been translated into Chinese
and Spanish), and"The Basis of
Soviet Strength" which was re
leased this year by the McGraw Hill
Book Company.
Stanford will have Dr. Cressey for
one year as visiting professor, then
he cxpects to return to Syracuse
University where he is Chairman of
the department of Geography.
Professor George B. Cressey is
not the first pioneer of his family,
nor was he the first to visit China.
Captain Josiah Cressey commanded

the "Flying Cloud" on her record
making trip around Cape Horn in
1851. And from San Francisco he
sailed his famous Clipper ship to
the port of Canton for a cargo of
tea and silk.
Dr. Cressey thus inherited a love
of adventure and pushed inland
from the seaports of Asia to the
heart of the continent.
As he himself says,"I like to see
how people live and why. The
more desolate their environment,
and the drier the landscape, the
more I enjoy it." He proved his
convictions in 1924 when he travelled
on foot from Peiping to Tibet, a
journey of 109 days.
Itickshaws No Luxury
Since his first long hike through
China, Dr. Cressey has tried all the
traditional Chinese means of trans
portation and reports that the most
comfortable way to travel by rick
shaw is to get out and walk.
He has travelled the war torn
Burma Road in U.S. jeeps and in
Chinese buses that have had no re
placed parts for ten years. Thirty
seven people may crowd into a six
man bus to beat all San Francisco
records. The drivers have no gaso
line; they use alcohol substitutes or
even charcoal burners. They have
no jacks to change the daily flat
tires, and more than one telephone
pole has served as a lever in the
hands of stranded passengers.
War Hazards
Wartime danger is no myth to
Dr. Ciessey. He has lived through
several air raids, and last year he
sailed only 17 miles from the Jap
anese lines in a junk whose ragged
sails could hardly catch the wind.
"We Americans don't know total
war," he says. "But China and the
Soviet Union do." Many of their
cities have been bombed almost out
of existence, and their shortage of
consumer goods is tragic. Chinese
inflation is unbelievable, and the
government has been powerless to
stop it. It emptied its treasury for
war materials and no longer has a
foreign trade to tax for revenue.
Income taxes are comparatively new
in China, and the country is too
poorly organized to make them
practical.

and the drier the landscape, the
more I enjoy it." He proved his
convictions in 1924 when he travelled
on foot from Peiping to Tibet, a
journey of 109 days.
Itickshaws No Luxury
Since his first long hike through
China, Dr. Cressey has tried all the
traditional Chinese means of trans
portation and reports that the most
comfortable way to travel by rick
shaw is to get out and walk.
He has travelled the war torn
Burma Road in U.S. jeeps and in
Chinese buses that have had no re
placed parts for ten years. Thirty
seven people may crowd into a six
man bus to beat all San Francisco
records. The drivers have no gaso
line; they use alcohol substitutes or
even charcoal burners. They have
no jacks to change the daily flat
tires, and more than one telephone
pole has served as a lever in the
hands of stranded passengers.
War Hazards
Wartime danger is no myth to
Dr. Ciessey. He has lived through
several air raids, and last year he
sailed only 17 miles from the Jap
anese lines in a junk whose ragged
sails could hardly catch the wind.
"We Americans don't know total
war," he says. "But China and the
Soviet Union do." Many of their
cities have been bombed almost out
of existence, and their shortage of
consumer goods is tragic. Chinese
inflation is unbelievable, and the
government has been powerless to
stop it. It emptied its treasury for
war materials and no longer has a
foreign trade to tax for revenue.
Income taxes are comparatively new
in China, and the country is too
poorly organized to make them
practical.
Tourist With Purpose
China is a land that Dr. Cressey
knows intimately. For he did not
visit Asia as a mere tourist; he went
there to study the people first hand
after many previous years of text
book acquainanee with them. He
taught six years at the University
of Shanghai, meanwhile observing
the nation's mining, manufacturing,
and agriculture. In 1934 he served
as consultant to China's National
Agricultural Research Bureau. In
1937 he was also consultant to the
Soviet government.
His last visit to Asia was in 1944
when he was sent to China by the
Division of Cultural Cooperation of
the United States Department of
State.
Professor Cressey has not confined
himself to China though. He has
studied the entire continent of Asia,
including India and the U.S.S.R. And
his adventures could fill many
books.
Swift Home Coming
His last return to the United
State was rapid, even though he
flew around thi*ee quarters of the
world to avoid the Pacific theater
of war. After crossing Soviet Mid
dle Asia, he left Casablanca one
afternoon and lunched the next day
at La Guardia Field in New York.
He was allowed only thirty pounds
of luggage including K rations,
which left little space for souvenirs.
But his notes weighed little; and
colorful mementos of China were
recorded on Kodachrome film which
preceded him by "official channels."
Three Books
From impressions gathered in his
many years of Asiatic travel, Dr.
Cressey has written three books,
"China's Geographic Foundation,"
"Asia's Lands and Peoples" (which
has been translated into Chinese
and Spanish), and"The Basis of
Soviet Strength" which was re
leased this year by the McGraw Hill
Book Company.
Stanford will have Dr. Cressey for
one year as visiting professor, then
he cxpects to return to Syracuse
University where he is Chairman of
the department of Geography.
