# Kennedy Says Excom Meetings Open
## Committee To Choose Two Members, Discuss Minutes, Ask for Hashers 
### 
ASSU President Bob Kennedy's statement at Thursday's assembly thai
"Your officers are ready to serve you—now let's have some ideas from you'
is an open invitation for all Stanford students to attend tonight's meeting
of Executive Committee, in the Excom Room of the Old Union at 7:15.
By observing student government in action, students will be more quali-

*fied to comment on problems that
arise during the year, according to
Kennedy. Gripes, arguments, sug
gestions may be referred to Exeom
representatives in various living
group areas, or brought up personal
ly by student, under the heading of
lew business.
Agenda for tonight's meeting
will include the following:
! Roll Call.
Approval of dales.
Old Business:
Report on Cellar Hashers.
Discussion of Article 11, scction
4 of constitution.
Any other old business.
New business:
Special edit fund of the Daily.
Election Board Chairman.
Men's Council Membership.
Any other new business.
Adjournment
Discussion on the Constitution will
cover the reading of minutes before
Excom. Although the Executive
Committee may at any time call for
the minutes of a committee or or
ganization under its jurisdiction, the
President alone will otherwise be
responsible for th ereading and ap
proval of their minutes. Kennely
feels this to be placing too much
power in the hands of the Presi
dent, and has thus called for Ex
com discussion.
i Still Need Hashers
' The problem that seems habitually
to confront Excom members at the
beginning of each quarter is with
them again—enough hashers for the
Cellar. Methods of encouraging stu
dents to work as hashers will be
discussed.
Two members elected to Men's
Council did not return this quarter,
leaving the problem of appointment
or election in Excom's hands. A
chairman of Election Board to suc
ceed J. D. Williams will be ap
pointed.
In addition to Kennedy, chairman
of the committee, and Charmian
Kolar, ASSU vice-president, there
are eight members from the living
group areas and army and navy
representatives plus ex-officio mem
bers representing Men's and Wom
en's Councils, Women's Conference,
the Stanford Daily, and the student
manager.
