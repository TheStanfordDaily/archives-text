# Ghosts Act In Campus Production
## Scotch Dialogue To Be Featured In October Play 
### 
"A Highland Fling," the Autumn
Quarter production of the Stanford
Players, follows the precedent of
many of the Little Theater produc
tions, in that it was first produced
on Broadway. The show was a
George Abbott production, and had
as its leads in the New York cast,
Ralph Forbes as the Ghost, and
Florence Reid as the Angel. Mar
garet Curtis, the author, played the
Village Daily.
The Stanford production stars
Walter Palance, as the 180 year old
Scotch ghost, who is doomed to
eternal ghosthood until he reforms
a mortal from sin. Mr. Palance is
an English major, but he is taking
his Speech and Drama minor se
riously. He came to Stanford im
mediately after his discharge from
the army to obtain a degree before
he consider sofTers from Hollywood.
Mr. Palance, who is studying to be
a character actor, says that he is
enjoying the training in Scotch dia
lect which the portrayal of the
Scotch ghost affords. Summer stu
dents will remember his participa
tion in "My Indian Family," the
summer production of the Players.
Mrs. Judy Shrader, a summer
qua) ter graduate in the department
of Spcech and Drama, is cast as the
Ange .lHer part is one of the two
parts in the play which does not
require a heavy Scotch brogue. This
will be Mrs. Shrader's first Uni
versity appearance, but she has
hopes of continuing a dramatic ca
reer.
The part of the Village DafTy, who
falls in love with the ghost, is played
by Miss Carol Boettcher, who many
will remember as an Olio perform
er in the Spring show. Miss Boettch
er is a major in Speech and Drama,
and a transfer from San Mateo
Junior College where she was active
in dramatics. Miss Boettcher is en
joying the challenge oflered by the
mastery of a Scotch accent, as are
most of the cast.
Tickets to individual perform
ances of the Stanford Players are
to go on sale October 15, in room
202 of the Memorial Auditorium.
