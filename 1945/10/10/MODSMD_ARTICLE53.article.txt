# Council Falls As Ministers Argue Peace
## Russian Orders Cause Molotov to Retract Peace Treaty Ideas 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 9.—(UP). —Foreign
Secretary Ernest Bevin today blamed
the breakdown of the recent For
eign Ministers' Council on Russian
government orders which caused
Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Molo
tov to change his attitude on discus
sion of peace treaties.
The Russian change of attitude,
he lold the House of Commons in
explaining the breakdown, came im
mediately after a British proposal
for an independent investigation of
the Russian-sponsored regimes in
Romania and Bulgaria.
Bevin said further that the ques
tion involved, though it might ap
pear technical, was really one of a
great principle—the extent to which
the Allied Big Three were to ex
clude other nations from matters of
"gravest concern" to them.
At the end of Bevin's statement,
made on the reopening of Parlia
ment after a six-week summer re
cess, Winston Churchill as leader of
the conservative opposition an
nounced that he would demand a
debate on the "disappointing events."
He left it to the government to de
cide the time. Viscount Cranborne,
conservative leader in the House of
Lords, made a similar demand.
Bevin's statement dominated the
opening session. But an indication
of the labor government's problems
was given in replies to members'

questions.
Prime Minister Clement Attlee re
fused a statement on British policy
toward Palestine. He promised one
later and said that "obviously" no
action would be taken before the
statement was made.
Attlee said that the government
was keeping in closest touch with
the United States and Canada on
atomic power developments and
would be glad to take part in a
conference such as President Tru
man had suggested.
