### 
TOKYO, Oct. 9 (UP).—Premier
Baron Kijuro Shidehara today
promised Japan an eight-point pro
gram of reform and warned Amer
ica to proceed cautiously in the
abolition of Shinto as the state re
ligion of Japan.
He declared emphatically that he
saw no reason why Emperor Hiro
hito should abdicate or why the
imperial institution should be
changed in any way at present.
Meets 4ft Reporters
Answering the questions of 40
Allied correspondents, Shidehara
promised legislation soon to break
up the great industrial combines
that have helped rule Japan for
years. He pledged speedy aboli
tion of the war and navy ministries.
Voicing the first official reaction
to a Washington announcement that
Shintoism would be abolished, the
new premier denied the crimes at
tributed to the religion were in
herent in Shinto beliefs.
Speaks with Caution
Speaking with extreme caution
to avoid any statement that might
cause unfavorable repercussion
among the Japanese masses, Shide
hara declared that the evils grow
ing out of the religion had been
caused by "distortions" enforced by
the Tojo militarists.
He resolutely parried all efforts
to make him admit that the whole
guilt for the war lay on Japan. He
refused a suggestion that he de
nounce those responsible for the
Pearl Harbor attack without quali
fication, presumably fearing a do
mestic repercussion that would em
barrass his government at the out
set.
His eight-point program for Japan
was contained in a formal press
statement released after the gruel
ing two-hour press conference.
