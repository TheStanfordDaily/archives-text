"Even the dead are expected to
come to the Washington Hall fire
side Saturday evening," Bob Galla
gher, vice president of the men's
hall said today, as he and other
Washington men made plans for a
mysterious '"Zombie Fireside."
Voodoo drums, tropical under
growth, and medicine man magic
have been enlisted to entertain
dancers from 9 to 1, Saturday eve
ning. Tropical punch will be served
from a "jungle trading post," while
couples dance to recorded music.
Couples were urged to "Go na
tive" at the open fireside . . . jeans,
Hawaiian shirts, and tropical dresses.
"We also welcome any zombies,"
Gallagher stated publically, as Wash
ington men are prepared to make
them feel right at home.
