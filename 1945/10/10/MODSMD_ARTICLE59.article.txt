# Economy Needed To Reduce Taxes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.—(UP).—
Republican members of the House
Ways and Means committee said
tonight future tax reductions could
be made only if the administration
stopped "wasteful and unnecessary
spending."
They set forth their position in a
statement prepared to accompany
the committee report on the $5,-
300,000.000 (B) tax relief bill, sched
uled for House consideration Thurs
day.
While welcoming the proposed tax
reductions, Republican members
said that "much greater" ones would
be possible now if the administra
tion had practiced strict economy.
