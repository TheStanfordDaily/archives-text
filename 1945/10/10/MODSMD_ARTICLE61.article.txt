# Court Orders Laval to Face Firing Squad
## French Jury Decides Fate of Betrayer In One Hour Session 
### 
PARIS. Oct. 9. — (UP).—Pierre
Laval, three-time premier of France,
was sentenced to death in absentia
today for betraying his country to
the Germans and helping them rivet
on the fetters which kept it in
slavery.
lie will meet his end before a
firing squad at Montrouge Fort
ress just outside of Paris, prob
ably before the end of the week.
Gen. Charles Dc Gaulle is cer
tain to reject any plea for clem
ency, it was said, and for that
reason, it was unlikely the swarthy
chief of the Vichy government
would make one.
His jury took only one hour to
arrive at its verdict of guilty of
both counts—treason and intelligence
with the enemy. Under the verdict
Laval also was sentenced to nation
al indignity and his fortune—once
one of the largest in France—was
ordered confiscated.
He was not in the courtroom
when what was to have been one
of France's historic trials fizzled to
its end like a performance of Hamlet
without the prince.
Maintaining that both the judge
and jury displayed prejudice, La
val had refused to return to the
courtroom after a tumultuous ses
sion Saturday when parties
shouted abuse at one another.
Neither defense attorneys nor de
fense witnesses were present at
yesterday's or today's sessions.
When the judge finished reading
the sentence and the court rose, the
clerk went to Laval's cell to inform
him of his fate. Laval heard him
through.
"I was expecting it,"he mut
tered. "I shall not sign any ap
peal for mercy."
The trial of the "most hated man
in France" lasted five days. It re
quired almost a month for a similar
verdict against Marshal Henri
Philippe Petain, 89, Vichy chief of
state, whose death sentence was
commuted to life imprisonment by
De Gaulle.
