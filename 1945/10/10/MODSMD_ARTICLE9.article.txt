## 
### 
With two speeches and spirited
discussion Debating Society started j
yesterday to examine some of the I
pros and cons of the advisability of J
world-wide free trade.
Ronald Klein and Jack Jones, the i
speakers, both discussed the matter !
from the point of view of world |
peace and of economic stability.
Tariff Barriers
Advocating an American policy I
leading toward free trade, Mr. Klein
maintained that tariff barriers I
would destroy international trade,
and, by encouraging power politics,
bring about future wars.
Free trade, he stated, would help
the consumer by giving him more )
efficient service at lower cost, it I
would help the producer, such as
the farmer, whose products, by be- I
ing sold abroad, would not flood the I
national market and depress price, I
and finally, it would benefit the I
peoples of the world, by bringing I
them lower prices, a higher stand- j
ard of. living and ready accessibil
ity to necessities and luxuries.
International Friction

In opposition Mr. Jones argued
that an abscnce of protective tar
iffs would result in a scramble for
foreign markets, causing interna
tional friction and war.
maintained further that it
would be harmful as regards eco
nomic stability and prosperity by
lowering our standard of living, by
leading to dangerous overspeciali
zation, and by giving rise to nation
wide monopolies.
Research Committees
Research committees were ap
pointed by Lcland T. Chapin, fac
ulty adviser, to provide debaters
with a file of relevant material.
Wallace McCall's committee will be
responsible for historical informa
tion, Lee Falk is in chargc of the
North American committee, George
Brunn heads the Latin American,
John Kaiser is chairman of the com
mittee on Europe, and John Liv
ingston of the one on Asia.
