50,000 RADARS
TWO years before Pearl Harbor the Govern
ment asked Bell Telephone Laboratories to
help perfect radar as a military instrument. The
Bell System, through the Western Electric Com
pany, its manufacturing branch, became the na
tion's largest supplier of radar systems.
Bell scientists designed and developed many
different types of radars â€” each for a specific job.
One particular type was standard for B-29s in
the Pacific for navigation, target location and
high altitude bombing. Another directed all Navy
guns over five inches.
This is not surprising, for radar development
and production stem from the same roots that
produced and continue to nourish this country's
telephone system.
