# Drive Hits 1000 Mark
## "Y" Membership Tops All Records 
### 
Rolling up a grand total of 1000
members, the "Y" drive today
topped percentage membership of
all other years, Chris Flack, co
chairman of the Stanford Y.W.C.A.
drive, reported from the final drive
figures.
Among those groups with 100 per
cent membership arc Union Resi
dence, Manzanita, Elm, Lathrop,
Mariposa, Roble, and Lagunita ca
sas Olivo, Magnolia, and Eucalypto.
"The committee members who
handled membership through indi
vidual groups did an outstanding
job," Miss Flack reported. "We are
grateful for the support the 'Y' has
received during this drive."
The actual drive for membership
officially closed Friday after a four
day campaign. However, all groups
did not complete final reports until
today.
Y.W.C.A. officers heading this
year's drive are Louise Phillips,
president; K. J. Supple, vice-presi
dent; Eleanor Brill, treasurer; Bar
bara Brooke, recording secretary,
and Sally Teachout, corresponding
secretary.
Dues collected in the member
ship drive are banked with Univer
sity funds and used to maintain the
"Y" club rooms on the third floor of
the Women's Clubhouse as well as
campus, intercollegiate and service
functions.
The Y.W.C.A. is one of the oldest
campus organizations. Founded one
year after Stanford itself, it has
grown from a membership of 110
to record the present thousand
members.
With a record of service, the "Y"
began Vocom, the International
Club, the sponsor system, and the
first Red Cross unit on the campus,
always receiving enthusiastic sup
port from the administration.
