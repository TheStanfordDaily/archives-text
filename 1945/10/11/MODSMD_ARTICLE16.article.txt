# Board Sets Fraternity Conditions
## Fayram Explains Advance Budget, Property Rules 
### 
Dick Fayram, Inter - Fraternity
Board chairman, has issued a
sobering reminder to over - zealous
fraternity men anxious to resume
house life next fall.
Many conditions must be met be
fore fraternities may reopen: (1)
house property must be cleared
through the Alumni Committee and
the University; (2) application to
Inter-Fraternity Board must be
made, listing chapter officers and
members responsible, plus assur
ance that the chapter knows Inter-
Fraternity Board rules of opera
tion; (3) a proposed operating budg
et for at least two quarters in ad
vance must be presented.
Fayram believes that both Bran
ner and Encina will have to be
made available to civilian men be
fore houses may take over from
University operation. Probably 18
ol the 24 Stanford Greek chapters
n ust reopen at the same time. This
will permit most fraternities equal
opportunity for rushing and pledg
ing. Of the 24, only about 12 fra
ternities are pledging at present.
Rushing preference cards, former
ly required of men pledging, have
been discontinued. Now, men de
siring to join a fraternity who have
not been contacted should sec Dick
at the Chaparral office. He will re
fer them to chapter presidents.
Chairman Fayram emphasized
that all Board rules are still in ef
fect. The number of pledges per
fraternity is limited to seven a
quarter. All pledges must be reg
istered immediately with Inter-
Fraternity Board. Although initia
tion of pledges may be held at any
time, only formal, ritual initiations
are permitted at present.
There is no rushing permitted in
the new Lower Division halls. Of
course, first-quarter freshmen and
men on probation are not eligible.
Inter-Fraternity Board is com
posed of six students, two alumni,
two faculty members and the Dean
of Students. Their rulings arc sub
ject only to the approval of the Uni
versity President.
Inter - Fraternity Council repre
sents the chapters with a man from
each group. They are under juris
diction of the Board. The council
will be reorganized as soon as ac
tive living groups start.
The University, desirous of closer
supervision of the fraternities when
they reopen, has asked for sugges
tions from the Board. House-moth
ers, married couples, alumni, and
other methods have been suggested.

istered immediately with Inter-
Fraternity Board. Although initia
tion of pledges may be held at any
time, only formal, ritual initiations
are permitted at present.
There is no rushing permitted in
the new Lower Division halls. Of
course, first-quarter freshmen and
men on probation are not eligible.
Inter-Fraternity Board is com
posed of six students, two alumni,
two faculty members and the Dean
of Students. Their rulings arc sub
ject only to the approval of the Uni
versity President.
Inter - Fraternity Council repre
sents the chapters with a man from
each group. They are under juris
diction of the Board. The council
will be reorganized as soon as ac
tive living groups start.
The University, desirous of closer
supervision of the fraternities when
they reopen, has asked for sugges
tions from the Board. House-moth
ers, married couples, alumni, and
other methods have been suggested.
Dick Fayram, Inter - Fraternity
Board chairman, has issued a
sobering reminder to over - zealous
fraternity men anxious to resume
house life next fall.
Many conditions must be met be
fore fraternities may reopen: (1)
house property must be cleared
through the Alumni Committee and
the University; (2) application to
Inter-Fraternity Board must be
made, listing chapter officers and
members responsible, plus assur
ance that the chapter knows Inter-
Fraternity Board rules of opera
tion; (3) a proposed operating budg
et for at least two quarters in ad
vance must be presented.
Fayram believes that both Bran
ner and Encina will have to be
made available to civilian men be
fore houses may take over from
University operation. Probably 18
ol the 24 Stanford Greek chapters
n ust reopen at the same time. This
will permit most fraternities equal
opportunity for rushing and pledg
ing. Of the 24, only about 12 fra
ternities are pledging at present.
Rushing preference cards, former
ly required of men pledging, have
been discontinued. Now, men de
siring to join a fraternity who have
not been contacted should sec Dick
at the Chaparral office. He will re
fer them to chapter presidents.
Chairman Fayram emphasized
that all Board rules are still in ef
fect. The number of pledges per
fraternity is limited to seven a
quarter. All pledges must be reg
istered immediately with Inter-
Fraternity Board. Although initia
tion of pledges may be held at any
time, only formal, ritual initiations
are permitted at present.
