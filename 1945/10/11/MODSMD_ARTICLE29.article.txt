Why Not a Literary Magazine?
Since its founding, Stanford has maintained an
unchallenged position as one of the leading pro
fessional schools in the country. Encourage
ment in undergraduate research in her various
departments has been virtually unstinted, with
wide opportunities for all students to gain fur
ther knowledge in their particular fields.
But there is still almost no opportunity for
students of creative writing to review their work
or to present it to Stanford students as a whole
for dppraisal of the writing they are doing.
Ever since Stanford was first organized, there
lias been a student-published literary magazine
in which the best works of the Farm's creative
writing students were printed. It is only within
the last few years that the custom of having a
literary magazine for serious student writing has
died out —due simply to the lack of interest and
encouragement from the rest of the campus.
Stanford has produced many eminent author
graduates . . . John Steinbeck, Maxwell Ander
son, Archie Binns, Bruce Bliven, and Will and
Wallace Irwin ... to name but a few. Today in
writing classes on the campus many would-be
authors, possessed with undergraduate talents
similar to those of the men just named, are pro
ducing work worthy of publication in a campus
magazine.
The only student publications now existing,
Ihe Daily and Chaparral, follow purposes that
make them unsuitable outlets for the publication
of undergraduate creative writing. Stanford's
would-be authors deserve a chance to publish
their work in their own magazine and to have it
open to student opinion and criticism, so that
they may receive the encouragement necessary
for them to go out into the world and make a
name for themselves and for Stanford.—M.S.
