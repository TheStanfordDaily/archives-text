# Bull Session

### Stanley Wilson 
Tonight comes the event all of us have been
■waiting for these several lean war years. Car
dinals are sponsoring an all-campus Back To
Sports rally, which should put us all in a high
spirited athletic mood.
Although football definitely is out for Stanford
this year, sports will resume come the basket
ball season. Spirit, pent up since 1942, will be
released at 7 p.m. in the men's gym and the day
of rooters' caps, pom poms and the Stanford Axe
yell will have its rebirth.
There has been a guantity of discussion this
quarter concerning Stanford spirit and the return
to normal by just about everyone on the Farm.
This is our chance to cease with the talk and
make with the action. Soldiers, sailors and civil
ian students are invited to the affair. As Bob
Kennedy said at the beginning of the current
quarter: "Let's Go Indians!"

Last night the performance of the "Greatest

Little Show on Earth," 1945-46 version, was
given on the Farm premises. I am referring to
Excom meeting. This troupe will play again lo
cally next Wednesday night. All seats will be
reserved. Phone 8201 for tickets.
The lead part in this Farm Fantasia is played
by fatherly, capable Robert Kennedy, who has
just returned from a command performance in
the Berkeley campus Middle-Sized Theater.
Kind, affable Kennedy is deserving of credit.
Playing opposite Charmian Kolar, who is cur
rently cast as the ingenue, his is a difficult task.
Never must Mr. Kennedy seem to take advan
tage of her, but always direct her efforts to the
highest goal.
Miss Kolar's part is a psychological problem.
She is harrassed by a gnawing desire to be an
Invisible Scarlett O'Hara and eliminate all dupli
cation or subterfuge in the forming of com
mittees.
The Inquiring Reporter is played by capable
and witty Daily Reporter. A person of affairs,
and worldly-wise, this character lends the met
ropolitan touch to a production of such magni
tude as this.
We must not forget, either, B. J. Calfee, cur
rently starring in the romantic lead. She plays
her part very ably and when she murmurs, "I
second the motion," with husky voice and low
ered fluttering eyelashes, she sometimes has
the true Bacall touch.
The juvenile lead is played by a newcomer
to the local theater group, one Betty Welling
ton. Teen-age Miss Wellington portrays the
fun-loving, rosy-cheeked college girl. She has
the efficiency of youth, with hope in her eyes,
and proves to be a refreshing and capable addi
tion in the Kennedy Kapers.
Excom is rivaling "Tobacco Road" in suc
cessive performances, and definitely is the place
to go after that dinner date. The nice feature
is that a late leave is not necessary to see the
complete show.

yell will have its rebirth.
There has been a guantity of discussion this
quarter concerning Stanford spirit and the return
to normal by just about everyone on the Farm.
This is our chance to cease with the talk and
make with the action. Soldiers, sailors and civil
ian students are invited to the affair. As Bob
Kennedy said at the beginning of the current
quarter: "Let's Go Indians!"

Last night the performance of the "Greatest

Little Show on Earth," 1945-46 version, was
given on the Farm premises. I am referring to
Excom meeting. This troupe will play again lo
cally next Wednesday night. All seats will be
reserved. Phone 8201 for tickets.
The lead part in this Farm Fantasia is played
by fatherly, capable Robert Kennedy, who has
just returned from a command performance in
the Berkeley campus Middle-Sized Theater.
Kind, affable Kennedy is deserving of credit.
Playing opposite Charmian Kolar, who is cur
rently cast as the ingenue, his is a difficult task.
Never must Mr. Kennedy seem to take advan
tage of her, but always direct her efforts to the
highest goal.
Miss Kolar's part is a psychological problem.
She is harrassed by a gnawing desire to be an
Invisible Scarlett O'Hara and eliminate all dupli
cation or subterfuge in the forming of com
mittees.
The Inquiring Reporter is played by capable
and witty Daily Reporter. A person of affairs,
and worldly-wise, this character lends the met
ropolitan touch to a production of such magni
tude as this.
We must not forget, either, B. J. Calfee, cur
rently starring in the romantic lead. She plays
her part very ably and when she murmurs, "I
second the motion," with husky voice and low
ered fluttering eyelashes, she sometimes has
the true Bacall touch.
The juvenile lead is played by a newcomer
to the local theater group, one Betty Welling
ton. Teen-age Miss Wellington portrays the
fun-loving, rosy-cheeked college girl. She has
the efficiency of youth, with hope in her eyes,
and proves to be a refreshing and capable addi
tion in the Kennedy Kapers.
Excom is rivaling "Tobacco Road" in suc
cessive performances, and definitely is the place
to go after that dinner date. The nice feature
is that a late leave is not necessary to see the
complete show.
Tonight comes the event all of us have been
■waiting for these several lean war years. Car
dinals are sponsoring an all-campus Back To
Sports rally, which should put us all in a high
spirited athletic mood.
Although football definitely is out for Stanford
this year, sports will resume come the basket
ball season. Spirit, pent up since 1942, will be
released at 7 p.m. in the men's gym and the day
of rooters' caps, pom poms and the Stanford Axe
yell will have its rebirth.
There has been a guantity of discussion this
quarter concerning Stanford spirit and the return
to normal by just about everyone on the Farm.
