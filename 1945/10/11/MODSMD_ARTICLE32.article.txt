HOPE IN THE ARGENTINE
The situation in the Argentine is still rather
nasiy, but there is hope for the liberals in the
feeling of desperation that the men on top have.
Pressure, external and internal, has forced the
officers of the army coup to eliminate their most
publicized and therefore most disliked member
—Colonel Peron. But this still is not a sign of
any great reform. The army is still in charge
down there, and the South American military
never has been guite a fountainhead of political
progressiveness.
PLANS OF MILITARY
According to a lot of documents recently pub
lished, the Argentine military intended to take
over and then establish their regime through a
lot of eye-catching pyrotechnics of militarist for
eign policy. The first act of the new government
thus was to create tanks, fighters, and a lot of
anti-American propaganda.
However, there were not enough in the first
two categories and the products in the third
were not effective. Using lend-lease, we built
up Brazil into a much stronger military power
than was Argentina, leaving the latter checked
in case she tried any overly-serious expansion.
To make things worse, the people in Argentina
showed that they were not going to stomach
or fight for a drang-nach-anything foreign pol
icy.
ABOUT TURN
So this didn't work, and the Argentine had
to create a new foreign policy to prevent being
caught in whirlwind of suspicious and armed
neighbors. She worked towards rapproche
ment with the Allies, to gain aid in case any of
her neighbors used their newly gained arms to
move in on her.
While she got temporary security through the
United Nations charter, and through Chapulte
pec, her dictators still had to face a large oppo
sition at home. To make things worse for them,
now they could no longer draw the people's
eyes away from it with a Blut-und-Eisen unifi
cation of South America.
So they had to start arrests, and had to attempt
to suppress opposition newspapers. Machiavelli
made the remark that when a Prince has to do
such things, he should do them all at once, and
accomplish them by simply killing his oppo
nents. Otherwise the Prince (or dictator) would
have to resort to new cruelties each day, and
couldn't let the people have time to forget
about them.
But, whether through natural inhibitions or
through fear of execution, the Peron group didn't
dare act in this fashion, so now it is getting a
more Fascistic reputation each day, and its peo
ple and the outsiders both are beginning to
hate it more and more each day.
But the present trend of events shows the best
way to handle the Argentine. Simply ignore it
until its people throw out the dictators. They
are afraid of the masses, and their fears are prob
ably not groundless. Anything else might tend
to confirm the charge that we wanted to dictate
to our neighbors, in too many people's eyes.

lished, the Argentine military intended to take
over and then establish their regime through a
lot of eye-catching pyrotechnics of militarist for
eign policy. The first act of the new government
thus was to create tanks, fighters, and a lot of
anti-American propaganda.
However, there were not enough in the first
two categories and the products in the third
were not effective. Using lend-lease, we built
up Brazil into a much stronger military power
than was Argentina, leaving the latter checked
in case she tried any overly-serious expansion.
To make things worse, the people in Argentina
showed that they were not going to stomach
or fight for a drang-nach-anything foreign pol
icy.
ABOUT TURN
So this didn't work, and the Argentine had
to create a new foreign policy to prevent being
caught in whirlwind of suspicious and armed
neighbors. She worked towards rapproche
ment with the Allies, to gain aid in case any of
her neighbors used their newly gained arms to
move in on her.
While she got temporary security through the
United Nations charter, and through Chapulte
pec, her dictators still had to face a large oppo
sition at home. To make things worse for them,
now they could no longer draw the people's
eyes away from it with a Blut-und-Eisen unifi
cation of South America.
So they had to start arrests, and had to attempt
to suppress opposition newspapers. Machiavelli
made the remark that when a Prince has to do
such things, he should do them all at once, and
accomplish them by simply killing his oppo
nents. Otherwise the Prince (or dictator) would
have to resort to new cruelties each day, and
couldn't let the people have time to forget
about them.
But, whether through natural inhibitions or
through fear of execution, the Peron group didn't
dare act in this fashion, so now it is getting a
more Fascistic reputation each day, and its peo
ple and the outsiders both are beginning to
hate it more and more each day.
But the present trend of events shows the best
way to handle the Argentine. Simply ignore it
until its people throw out the dictators. They
are afraid of the masses, and their fears are prob
ably not groundless. Anything else might tend
to confirm the charge that we wanted to dictate
to our neighbors, in too many people's eyes.
HOPE IN THE ARGENTINE
The situation in the Argentine is still rather
nasiy, but there is hope for the liberals in the
feeling of desperation that the men on top have.
Pressure, external and internal, has forced the
officers of the army coup to eliminate their most
publicized and therefore most disliked member
—Colonel Peron. But this still is not a sign of
any great reform. The army is still in charge
down there, and the South American military
never has been guite a fountainhead of political
progressiveness.
