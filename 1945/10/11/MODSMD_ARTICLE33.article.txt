# Patten Praises Conference Idea

### PAT MOONEY 
Have you ever wondered by what
lines of subterranean communica
tion all the women's living groups
on campus can keep in touch with
each other and discuss their vari
ous problems? No, it takes more
than the telephone. The instrument
is Women's Conference, and the
president of this very important or
ganization is Patty Patten.
Miss Patten, former chairman of
War Board, the Blood Bank, on
Women's Council, and a sponsor, is
a journalism major and hopes to
write for a magazine or do adver
tising work after graduation.
Ideas Exchanged
Women's Conference, according
to Miss Patten, is the only body
whereby all the women on campus
can be represented and where there
can be a liberal exchange of ideas
between all living groups, no mat
ter how separated they may be. It
is up to the women to suggest in
their house meetings any subject
pertinent to the campus that they
feel is in need of discussion. The
house presidents in their turn must
be representative of their houses
and take an active part in knowing

the feelings of the group on any
question, Miss Patten continued.
"Up to now we have had very
fine discussions in Conference," she
said, "but it is necessary that sug
gestions be brought in to insure
that problems are discussed and
solved."
Efficiency Necessary
Conference is working for the
things in the best interest of all
Stanford women, and a good and
efficient Conference is only possible
where there is interest and active
participation, according to Miss
Patton.
A graduate of South Pasadena
High School, Miss Patten said she
sandwiched her school activities in
between horseback riding, part of
the time on the horse and part of
the time falling off. She expressed
amazement that she ever had time
to get through school between her
frequent falls.
Plans for Future
As for the future of Women's
Conference, Miss Patten concluded,
there are several plans, in addition
to the appointment of new officers
for Vocational Committee, which
have not yet been discussed and are
therefore not ready for publication.
