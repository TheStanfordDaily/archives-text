# Sylvia Davis Tells Rise From Clean-up Committee
## 
### MARION MORROW 
Two flights above the A.S.S.U. of
fice there's a small room which tra
ditionally serves as the headquar
ters for the chairman of Women's
Council. This quarter the position
is filled by Sylvia Davis, a Stan
ford woman who says her main in
terest in life is people.
Miss Davis is a first-quarter sen
ior at Stanford, and her three years
at the Farm have been spent in

many activities, augmented, of
course, by the usual hard labor
which in her case is in the field of
humanities.
Starts Career
Her active career at Stanford be
gan on clean-up committees, she
laughingly admits, and her fresh
man year at Roble was mostly spent
doing those duties which have
given so many Stanfordites their
beginning.
By the time she returned to Roble
as a sponsor last winter and spring
quarters, she had been fire-chief
at Union, had been extremely in
terested and active in the Y.W.C.A.,
and a chairman of the Music Listen
ing Room with which she is still
"vitally concerned."
People Her Hobby
Since her pet hobby and most
sincere interest is people, she hopes
to be able to work with them after
she is graduated. This interest in
people, she thinks, has been greatly
gratified by work on Council, and
in several instances the honest ac
tions of students in supporting the
Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code have made her very
happy and proud.
Luckily Miss Davis has an ex
cellent sense of humor, for her pres
ent work affords her many amus
ing situations. For example, in the
midst of the interview, the phone
rang. The conversation was some
thing like this:
Crazy Conversations
"Yes? You want to know how
many floaters you have? Well, what
quarter are you? A first-quarter
freshman. I see. Are you minus?
Oh, you went minus just your last
quarter."
If the freshman, first quarter, had
gone minus "just her last quarter,"
what did she do her first quarter?
Wonderful People
Miss Davis thinks one of the
best things about Council is the
wonderful people with whom she
is able to work, and the fact that
the "responsibility doesn't all fall
on the chairman—there are such
good people on Council."
Miss Davis lives in Millbrae, and
was graduated from Burlingame
High School.

which in her case is in the field of
humanities.
Starts Career
Her active career at Stanford be
gan on clean-up committees, she
laughingly admits, and her fresh
man year at Roble was mostly spent
doing those duties which have
given so many Stanfordites their
beginning.
By the time she returned to Roble
as a sponsor last winter and spring
quarters, she had been fire-chief
at Union, had been extremely in
terested and active in the Y.W.C.A.,
and a chairman of the Music Listen
ing Room with which she is still
"vitally concerned."
People Her Hobby
Since her pet hobby and most
sincere interest is people, she hopes
to be able to work with them after
she is graduated. This interest in
people, she thinks, has been greatly
gratified by work on Council, and
in several instances the honest ac
tions of students in supporting the
Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code have made her very
happy and proud.
Luckily Miss Davis has an ex
cellent sense of humor, for her pres
ent work affords her many amus
ing situations. For example, in the
midst of the interview, the phone
rang. The conversation was some
thing like this:
Crazy Conversations
"Yes? You want to know how
many floaters you have? Well, what
quarter are you? A first-quarter
freshman. I see. Are you minus?
Oh, you went minus just your last
quarter."
If the freshman, first quarter, had
gone minus "just her last quarter,"
what did she do her first quarter?
Wonderful People
Miss Davis thinks one of the
best things about Council is the
wonderful people with whom she
is able to work, and the fact that
the "responsibility doesn't all fall
on the chairman—there are such
good people on Council."
Miss Davis lives in Millbrae, and
was graduated from Burlingame
High School.
Two flights above the A.S.S.U. of
fice there's a small room which tra
ditionally serves as the headquar
ters for the chairman of Women's
Council. This quarter the position
is filled by Sylvia Davis, a Stan
ford woman who says her main in
terest in life is people.
Miss Davis is a first-quarter sen
ior at Stanford, and her three years
at the Farm have been spent in

many activities, augmented, of
course, by the usual hard labor
which in her case is in the field of
humanities.
