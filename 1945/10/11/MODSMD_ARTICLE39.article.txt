### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
This past season has seen many
forward steps taken in the world
of popular music. Characterized by

the rise of many |
new, relaxed,
jump units and
variou small, re- ]
hearsed combina
tions, the coun
try is becoming
increasingly more
jazz conscious. In

future weeks, the recordings, stage,
and radio shows of these and the
older, lasting groups will be pre
sented and discussed in this column.
This week, by way of introduction,
these bands, their leaders, and their
sidemen will be reviewed.
Ellington Perfection
Among the well-established maes
tros who have weathered the storm
of commerciaHsm and have con
sistently succeeded in paving the
way for the march of "time," are
such jazz greats as Duke Ellington,
Count Basie, and Benny Goodman.
Ellington's band has reached a peak
of perfection. Surrounding himself
with some of the finest instrumental
ists on the swing scene, the Duke
has certainly furthered his reputa
tion of superiority among musi
cians.
Having lost the main stays of his
band in Lester Young and Jo Jones,
Count Basie has nevertheless been
able to maintain a solid top flight
unit.
King of Swing
Although Benny Goodman's new
band has been a dissappointment to
his fans, the sextet he succeeded in
salvaging from Billy Rose's show,
"Seven Lively Arts" has provided
us with a reminder that Benny is
still "King of Swing."
Leading the list of small combos
which have so recently come to the
fore is the wonderful team of John
ny Miller, Nat Cole, and Oscar
Moore comprising, of course, The
King Cole Trio. Following at a
safe distance are The Gene Krupa
Jazz Trio, The Terry Wilson Quin
tet, Eddie Heywood and his Or
chestra, The Art Tatum Trio, and
recording under various labels and
in numerous groups such 52nd St.
characters as Dizzy Gillespie, Slam
Stewart, Red Norvo and Ed Hall.
"Pops" Hampton
Jumping their way to the top
duriny the past year have been the
frantic free-swinging bands of
Lionel "Pops" Hampton and Woody
Herman. Featuring relaxed, head
arrangements, these two groups
have excited audiences wherever
they have performed.
Bands more in a rut than in a
groove include the Brothers Dorsry,
Artie Shaw (sans Eldridge) Hairy
James, Vaughn Monroe, Freddy
iMartin, and last but least—Guy
Lombardo.

frantic free-swinging bands of
Lionel "Pops" Hampton and Woody
Herman. Featuring relaxed, head
arrangements, these two groups
have excited audiences wherever
they have performed.
Bands more in a rut than in a
groove include the Brothers Dorsry,
Artie Shaw (sans Eldridge) Hairy
James, Vaughn Monroe, Freddy
iMartin, and last but least—Guy
Lombardo.

This past season has seen many
forward steps taken in the world
of popular music. Characterized by

the rise of many |
new, relaxed,
jump units and
variou small, re- ]
hearsed combina
tions, the coun
try is becoming
increasingly more
jazz conscious. In

future weeks, the recordings, stage,
and radio shows of these and the
older, lasting groups will be pre
sented and discussed in this column.
This week, by way of introduction,
these bands, their leaders, and their
sidemen will be reviewed.
Ellington Perfection
Among the well-established maes
tros who have weathered the storm
of commerciaHsm and have con
sistently succeeded in paving the
way for the march of "time," are
such jazz greats as Duke Ellington,
Count Basie, and Benny Goodman.
Ellington's band has reached a peak
of perfection. Surrounding himself
with some of the finest instrumental
ists on the swing scene, the Duke
has certainly furthered his reputa
tion of superiority among musi
cians.
Having lost the main stays of his
band in Lester Young and Jo Jones,
Count Basie has nevertheless been
able to maintain a solid top flight
unit.
King of Swing
Although Benny Goodman's new
band has been a dissappointment to
his fans, the sextet he succeeded in
salvaging from Billy Rose's show,
"Seven Lively Arts" has provided
us with a reminder that Benny is
still "King of Swing."
Leading the list of small combos
which have so recently come to the
fore is the wonderful team of John
ny Miller, Nat Cole, and Oscar
Moore comprising, of course, The
King Cole Trio. Following at a
safe distance are The Gene Krupa
Jazz Trio, The Terry Wilson Quin
tet, Eddie Heywood and his Or
chestra, The Art Tatum Trio, and
recording under various labels and
in numerous groups such 52nd St.
characters as Dizzy Gillespie, Slam
Stewart, Red Norvo and Ed Hall.
"Pops" Hampton
Jumping their way to the top
duriny the past year have been the

Herman. Featuring relaxed, head
arrangements, these two groups
have excited audiences wherever
they have performed.
