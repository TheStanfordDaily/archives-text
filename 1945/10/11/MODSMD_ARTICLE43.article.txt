## Farm Rally Tonight Starts Comeback Fight SIDELINE SLANTS 
### BOB SLOBE 
Coast football is beginning to look
like the real thing again since the
war came to such a timely end—not
timely enough however for Stan
ford to field anything that looks
like a team. The University of Cal
ifornia Bears began to look like a
football team when they overpow
ered the Washington Huskies 27-14
last week. The addition of Agnew
and Buestad in the backfield proved
that a team always plays better
when they have a little running,
passing, and kicking to go on. We
look for Agnew to improve much
more after he regains a little of the
confidence and drive he had when
he was a triple threat back for Pied
mont High and the Stanford Frosh
of lfi4o.
However, there are teams on the
coast that probably have greater
potentialities than the Golden Bears.
Callanan, Lillywhite and Tannehill
of the Trojans looked plenty good
for Troy in the game against Cal,
and although the latter two were
injured they are back in the USC
lineup ready to play again — So
watch Troy. They could go to the
Rosebowl for the third straight
time.
For a change, I think I will agree
with Bill Leiser of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle when he says Her
man Wedemeyer of the Galloping
Gaels is one of the greatest backs
he ever did see. "Wedey" is our
one and only coast candidate for
All American this year. He was
great in the Gaels first contest
against Cal and he has been getting
belter every game. The Wedemeyer
to Cordeiro combo has every de
fensive backfield on the coast sit
ting up and taking notice. He runs
hard, too. Take, for example, the
19 yard touchdown run Wedey made
last Sunday against Nevada. The

play originally called for a pass but
he was boxed in by the whole Ne
vada line; so he promptly proceed
ed to outrun his pursuers and score
—and he does it as calmly and easi
ly as il sounds.
The Associated Press Poll found
St. Mary's only nineteenth in the
nation and they placed USC sixth.
I would with a certainty venture
to prophesy that Coach Jim Phel
an's gridsters will dump USC and
take that spot away from them in
their not so distant meeting.
Many service teams are fielding
squads that some pro coaches would
be glad to have playing for them.
Fleet City's 88-0 triumph over Camp
Beale last Saturday is a mild ex
ample of how good these teams are.
What mentor wouldn't murder his
loving grandmother to have such
stars as Ed "Special Delivery" Jones,
Buddy Young, and Steve Juzwik
playing for him. The only thing
lacking in these games is the col
lege spirit that spectators like to see
and hear when they go to football
games. Here again we could prob
ably say the same thing about pro
fessional football games, and this is
one leason why such games will
probably never succeed like pro
fessional baseball. People don't like
to sec games played as a business.
At this point we would like to
print a few apologies and atone for
a few previous sins. Due to a mix
up in the Daily cut files, the pic
ture of Jimmy Coffis printed a week
or so ago was not Jimmy Coffis, but
Don Burness, basketball great on
the '41 championship team.
Also that Art Levinson leads our
Daily football pickers instead of A 1
Sciaroni as previously reported. As
a climax we would like to correct
something that touches us deeply.
The Hilltoppers were the 51-0 vic
tors in the Hilltoppers-Cleveland
game and not Cleveland as prev
iously reported.

Fleet City's 88-0 triumph over Camp
Beale last Saturday is a mild ex
ample of how good these teams are.
What mentor wouldn't murder his
loving grandmother to have such
stars as Ed "Special Delivery" Jones,
Buddy Young, and Steve Juzwik
playing for him. The only thing
lacking in these games is the col
lege spirit that spectators like to see
and hear when they go to football
games. Here again we could prob
ably say the same thing about pro
fessional football games, and this is
one leason why such games will
probably never succeed like pro
fessional baseball. People don't like
to sec games played as a business.
At this point we would like to
print a few apologies and atone for
a few previous sins. Due to a mix
up in the Daily cut files, the pic
ture of Jimmy Coffis printed a week
or so ago was not Jimmy Coffis, but
Don Burness, basketball great on
the '41 championship team.
Also that Art Levinson leads our
Daily football pickers instead of A 1
Sciaroni as previously reported. As
a climax we would like to correct
something that touches us deeply.
The Hilltoppers were the 51-0 vic

game and not Cleveland as prev

Coast football is beginning to look
like the real thing again since the
war came to such a timely end—not
timely enough however for Stan
ford to field anything that looks
like a team. The University of Cal
ifornia Bears began to look like a
football team when they overpow
ered the Washington Huskies 27-14
last week. The addition of Agnew
and Buestad in the backfield proved
that a team always plays better
when they have a little running,
passing, and kicking to go on. We
look for Agnew to improve much
more after he regains a little of the
confidence and drive he had when
he was a triple threat back for Pied
mont High and the Stanford Frosh
of lfi4o.
However, there are teams on the
coast that probably have greater
potentialities than the Golden Bears.
Callanan, Lillywhite and Tannehill
of the Trojans looked plenty good
for Troy in the game against Cal,
and although the latter two were
injured they are back in the USC
lineup ready to play again — So
watch Troy. They could go to the
Rosebowl for the third straight
time.
For a change, I think I will agree
with Bill Leiser of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle when he says Her
man Wedemeyer of the Galloping
Gaels is one of the greatest backs
he ever did see. "Wedey" is our
one and only coast candidate for
All American this year. He was
great in the Gaels first contest
against Cal and he has been getting
belter every game. The Wedemeyer
to Cordeiro combo has every de
fensive backfield on the coast sit
ting up and taking notice. He runs
hard, too. Take, for example, the
19 yard touchdown run Wedey made
last Sunday against Nevada. The

play originally called for a pass but
he was boxed in by the whole Ne
vada line; so he promptly proceed
ed to outrun his pursuers and score
—and he does it as calmly and easi
ly as il sounds.
The Associated Press Poll found
St. Mary's only nineteenth in the

I would with a certainty venture
to prophesy that Coach Jim Phel

take that spot away from them in
their not so distant meeting.
