# Dean Stresses Fundamentals
## 
### 
Yesterday's rain gave the basket
ball tryoutees a chance to go onto
the floor and do a little of what
they have been wanting to do for
a loT'g time. After taking six and
seven laps a day for a week of
practice and then playing volleyball
to develop timing and leg muscles,
they were a little anxious to do
some basketball playing.
Coach Dean hud his boys do a
few rounds of shooting setups,
and then taught them a passing
exercise after first giving them a
few instructions on the funda
mentals of passing the hall and
receiving it. He then divided them
up into six small squads and
told them to go it.and turn loose
some of that pressure that had
been building up.
Tomorrow morning will see a
bunch of boys with tired wrists and
fingers, and aching backs even after
yesterday's light workout.
Dean still has not had a chance
to ascertain the assets and liabili
ties ol his squad of some 50 men.
but he intends to cut the team to
working size in a few weeks. He
hopes to have a Jayvee in order
to allow more men to gain valu
able experience in competition, for
he is now making arrangements
to get into the Pacific Coast Con
ference. Dean has expressed the
desire to play a few games before
the end of November, and soon
will shoot practice sessions into
high gear when he will have
practice five nights a week.
