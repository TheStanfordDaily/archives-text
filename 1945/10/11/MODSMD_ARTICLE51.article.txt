BERKELEY. Calif., Oct. 10.—(UP)
—The California Bears went through
a light line scrimmage drill today
while Coach Buck Shaw sought to
determine the 28 players he will
include in the squad which leaves
at 6 p.m. tomorrow for Saturday's
game with UCLA.
Shaw did not yet know if Bob
Edmunston, right half back who suf
fered an ankle injury in the Cali
fornia-Stanford game, would make
the trip, but indications were he
would be unable to play even if he
did go.
The California Ramblers will play
Modesto Junior College at Modesto
Saturday night.
