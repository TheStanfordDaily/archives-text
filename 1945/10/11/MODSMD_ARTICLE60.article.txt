# Bengals Thump Cubs, Cop Series Finale
## 
### OSCAR FRALEY United Press Sports Writer 
CHICAGO, Oct. 10 (UP). —The
Detroit Tigers won the 1945 World
Series today when they broke the
seventh and deciding game wide
open in the first 15 minutes and
then coasted to a 9 to 3 victory
over the Chicago Cubs behind the
southpaw magic of Hal Newhouser.
The game was billed as a pitch
ing battle between Newhouser, the
major leagues' leading winner, and
Hank Borowy, an American League
cast-oft' had beaten these
Tigers in this classic.
But Borowy lasted just nine
pitches as the Bengal bats roared
with explosive power and drove
him to the showers after facing
only three men. And before old
Paul Derringer stilled the thun
der, the Tigers had chased five
runs across the plate and stag
gered the Cubs irrevocably.
After that the Tigers never let up,
building to that lead as they went
along and leaving the rest of it to
Newhouser. The skinny kid from
Detroit didn't let them down, even
though he gave the struggling Cubs
a high total of 10 hits.
But that wasn't the story this
overcast afternoon.
Bengals Knock Borowy
For Skeeter Webb, with the count
three and two, belted Hank's sixth
pitch into right field for a single.
And the second Tiger batter, clutch
man Eddie Mayo, had to look at only
one offering; that one he drove into
right field and Webb was jittering
around on third base. Pioger Cra
mer was next and after taking a
ball. Doc laid a single down the left
field foul line which sent Webb
scampering home and moved Mayo
to second.
That was the end of Borowy.
Paul Derringer was next in what
was to be a Chicago paarde of six
pitchers. Hank Greenberg sacri
ficed pushing Mayo to third and
Cramer to second, and Derringer
intentionally walked Cullenbine to
get to York.
Rudy popped out, and then Der
ringer lost control as he walked
Jimmy Outlaw on four straight
pitches, forcing Mayo home.
Then came the blow that really
broke up the ball game while
the customers still were getting
settled in their seats. Paul Rich
ards, the Tiger catcher, fired a
double along the left-field foul
line which cleared the bases as
Cramer, Cullenbine, and Outlaw
all went flying past the plate.
The Bengals went out after more
padding in the second. With two
away, Cramer singled to center,

Greenberg walked and Cullenbine
walked on a three-two pitch to fill
the bases. This time it was Der
ringer who faltered, walking York
on a three-two count to score Cra
mer.
Cubs Tally in Fourth
The Cubs still hadn't quit and
were recovering their poise as they
scored on young Hal in the fourth.
With one out, Cavaretta came up
with his second straight hit. a slash
ing single to right field, and Andy
Pai'ko tripled to center, Cramer
misjudging the ball as it rolled to
the wall and Cavaretta, meanwhile,
racing home.
Richards Doubles Again
Paul Erickson was tossing them
up lor the Cubs when the Tigers
went to bat in the seventh and got
back that run. Cullenbine got on
through a free pass and two men
went down as he stood there. Rich
ards, the man who wrecked the
Cubs in the first inning, powered
his second double and as it rolled
to the right-field wall, Cullenbine
came home.
The Tigers poured on still more
in the eighth. Webb started them
with a walk and came all the way
home as Mayo pounded a double
into the left-field corner. Mayo
went to third as Cramer grounded
out and little Eddie scored as
Greenberg sent a deep fly to left
field.
Seeing the major portion of the
series pot of gold slipping away,
the Cubs were batting for every
thing in the eighth and it paid off
with another run as they touched
Hal for three hits in the eighth.

Series today when they broke the
seventh and deciding game wide
open in the first 15 minutes and
then coasted to a 9 to 3 victory
over the Chicago Cubs behind the
southpaw magic of Hal Newhouser.
The game was billed as a pitch
ing battle between Newhouser, the
major leagues' leading winner, and
Hank Borowy, an American League
cast-oft' had beaten these
Tigers in this classic.
But Borowy lasted just nine
pitches as the Bengal bats roared
with explosive power and drove
him to the showers after facing
only three men. And before old
Paul Derringer stilled the thun
der, the Tigers had chased five
runs across the plate and stag
gered the Cubs irrevocably.
After that the Tigers never let up,
building to that lead as they went
along and leaving the rest of it to
Newhouser. The skinny kid from
Detroit didn't let them down, even
though he gave the struggling Cubs
a high total of 10 hits.
But that wasn't the story this
overcast afternoon.
Bengals Knock Borowy
For Skeeter Webb, with the count
three and two, belted Hank's sixth
pitch into right field for a single.
And the second Tiger batter, clutch
man Eddie Mayo, had to look at only
one offering; that one he drove into
right field and Webb was jittering
around on third base. Pioger Cra
mer was next and after taking a
ball. Doc laid a single down the left
field foul line which sent Webb
scampering home and moved Mayo
to second.
That was the end of Borowy.
Paul Derringer was next in what
was to be a Chicago paarde of six
pitchers. Hank Greenberg sacri
ficed pushing Mayo to third and
Cramer to second, and Derringer
intentionally walked Cullenbine to
get to York.
Rudy popped out, and then Der
ringer lost control as he walked
Jimmy Outlaw on four straight
pitches, forcing Mayo home.
Then came the blow that really
broke up the ball game while
the customers still were getting
settled in their seats. Paul Rich
ards, the Tiger catcher, fired a
double along the left-field foul
line which cleared the bases as
Cramer, Cullenbine, and Outlaw
all went flying past the plate.
The Bengals went out after more
padding in the second. With two
away, Cramer singled to center,

Greenberg walked and Cullenbine
walked on a three-two pitch to fill
the bases. This time it was Der
ringer who faltered, walking York
on a three-two count to score Cra
mer.
Cubs Tally in Fourth
The Cubs still hadn't quit and
were recovering their poise as they
scored on young Hal in the fourth.
With one out, Cavaretta came up
with his second straight hit. a slash
ing single to right field, and Andy
Pai'ko tripled to center, Cramer
misjudging the ball as it rolled to
the wall and Cavaretta, meanwhile,
racing home.
Richards Doubles Again
Paul Erickson was tossing them
up lor the Cubs when the Tigers
went to bat in the seventh and got
back that run. Cullenbine got on
through a free pass and two men
went down as he stood there. Rich
ards, the man who wrecked the
Cubs in the first inning, powered
his second double and as it rolled
to the right-field wall, Cullenbine
came home.
The Tigers poured on still more
in the eighth. Webb started them
with a walk and came all the way
home as Mayo pounded a double
into the left-field corner. Mayo
went to third as Cramer grounded
out and little Eddie scored as
Greenberg sent a deep fly to left
field.
Seeing the major portion of the
series pot of gold slipping away,
the Cubs were batting for every
thing in the eighth and it paid off
with another run as they touched
Hal for three hits in the eighth.
