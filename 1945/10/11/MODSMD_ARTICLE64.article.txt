# Police Arrest Pickets by Force As Studio Faces Movie-less Day
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 10 (UP).â€”
Two hundred deputy sheriifs, carry
ing tear gas and submachine guns,
swept up 600 pickets massed around
Warner Bros, studio tuday and ar
rested them on charges of unlawful
assembly, but movie-making re
mained at a standstill.
A studio spokesman said that
"very few" workers entered the
gates after the picket siege line was
removed and that no film could be
shot until cameramen, actors and
other necessary personnel come
back to work.
It was the second straight movie
less day at Warners'.
The Screen Actors' Guild, cam
eramen, eostumers and other .skilled
crafts have instructed their mem
bers to remain away until they are
sure the violence that has flared

about the studio for the past five
days is over.
Municipal Judge R. L. Reed or
dered the pickets released on their
own recognizance. Police freed
them as rapidly as booking was
completed, but some may have to
stay all night in jail.
Bond of $500 to $1500 previously
had been ordered and strike leader

Herbert Sorrell said the strike com
mittee would use what little money
it had to free key strike personnel
because it could not afford to re
lease all the arrested men.
Instead of the 1000-man lines that
have surrounded Warner Bros, since
Friday, 18 pickets protected by a
court order and sheriff's deputies
patrolled peacefully about the gates
today.
Threats that mass picketing would
be renewed tomorrow came, how
ever, from strike leaders and from
Lockheed aircraft employees in
District Lodge 727 of the Interna
tional Association of Machinists
(AFL), some of whose members
were arrested with other pickets.
They said they would have as
many as 10.000 aircraft workers in
the line tomorrow.
