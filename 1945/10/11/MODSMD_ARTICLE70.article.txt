WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (UP).â€”
Secretary of State James F. Byrnes
today in effect rejected Russia's pro
posal for immediate establishment
of a four-power control council in
Japan by describing it as unwsie.
But he left the door open by say
ing it was something for the new
Far Eastern Advisory Commission
to consider.
In his first press cnoference since
returning from the stalemated Lon
don foreign ministers' conference,
Byrnes said:
There was no U.S. intention of
altering Gen. Douglas Mac-Arthur's
status as supreme Allied command
er; there had been no complaints on
Mac Arthur's conduct of the occupa
tion job; that in his opinion the Rus
sian proposal would not remove
McArthur from his present position.
