# Men's Dining Halls To Open
## 
### 
Utopia in the form of seconds and
all the milk they can drink will
come to the Stanford rough Monday
when Buchanan and Monroe are
opened as men's dining halls, Lu
cien Rice said last night.
The University agreed to the
opening of the two halls on an in
dependent status after extensive
discussions had taken place between
the administration and the organize
ers of the movement. "Instrumental
in giving the men at Stanford a
good deal on the food situation was
Dean John Stalnaker," Rice said.
Petition Passed
The opening of the halls comes
as the result of a long concentrated
movement to give the men students
at Stanford a decent place to eat.
It is expected that the openings will
greatly alleviate the crowded con
ditions at the Cellar and at the Stu
dent Union.
Promoters of the Buchanan move
ment were Charlie Clark and John
Erlich who personally proposed the
plan to President Donald B. Tres
idder. Previous to the meeting with

Dr. Tresidder, petitions had been
passed in men's residences advocat
ing the proposal.
Instrumental in the Monroe
movement were Lucicn Rice and
Jim McKinney, who will be head
hasher when the hall opens Mon
day.
Quality Stressed
Under the accepted plan the man
agers and cooks will have complete
independence in the buying of food
and supplies. This is essentially the
same plan that Lincoln Hall has
been operating on to feed the med
ics there.
"Sti'essing quality, the dining
halls will put out good food, and if
we can't put out good food, we'll
quit," Rice said.
Competent cooks have been hired
for the two halls, the cook at Mon
roe having been associated with the
Delt house and the Buchanan cook
with the A.T.O.'s.
The halls will open with luncheon
Monday afternoon. Hours an
nounced for the halls arc: break
fast, between 7:30 and 8:U0; lunch
eon, 12:15; dinner, 6:15.
Transfer Penalty
Buchanan will not serve meals on
Saturday but instead will serve two
meals Sunday, breakfast at 9 and
dinner at 1 p.m. Monroe will re
verse this procedure and serve Sat
urday morning and noon but not on
Sundays.
Board for the dining halls will be
$100 for the remainder of the quar
ter. This must be paid today or
tomorrow in the Administration
building, Rice stressed. Students
transferring from Encina Commons
will have to pay $120 for the re
mainder of the quarter, the extra
cost being an obvious movement to
discourage such transferring.
Ration books will be collected by
John Erlich at Buchanan and Lucicn
Rice at Monroe at a future date. ,

It is expected that the openings will
greatly alleviate the crowded con
ditions at the Cellar and at the Stu
dent Union.
Promoters of the Buchanan move
ment were Charlie Clark and John
Erlich who personally proposed the

halls will put out good food, and if
we can't put out good food, we'll
quit," Rice said.
