# Art Gallery Displays French Modernists
## 
### 
Impressionism is a subject few
of us understand but the Pissaro's
and the Manet's and the Rouault's
now on display at the Stanford Art
Gallery until October 28 are hav
ing a tremendous elTect on modern
art trends and are worth looking
at in this light.
Several in this group of modern
French paintings now on display

are more curiosities than things of
beauty but all can't help but hold
the onlooker's interest.
Derain on Display
Center of attraction during the
opening days of the display have
been Derain's "Bateaux Thierce
ville," a strange modernistic oil of
the machine age; Van Gogh's 4 'Les
Maison's Blanches," the only one by
this artist on display, and the va
rious Matisse's loaned by Mrs.
Michael D. Stein.
Other artists on display in the
collection are Redon, Cezanne,
Gauguin, Picasso, Modigliani, Gro
maire, Utrillo, Miro, Gris, Klee, and
Leger.
