Although the committee needs a few members with artistic

ability, a lively interest in Stanford and student activities is
the main requirement for tryoutees, they said. Mitguard empha
sizes the fact that this year's work will consist almost entirely
of building the Rally Committee to its former place in Farm life.
Students willing to perform the necessary tasks now will be able
to participate in the extensive activities planned for 1946.
Rally Com will consist of twenty members this quarter —the
four seniors now on the committee plus six sophomore and
three junior men, and four sophomore and three junior women.
Six or eight frosh will be placed on a junior committee, and
will have a chance to graduate into full-fledged members if they
prove capable.
Cardinal Approval
After the interviews are completed Tuesday afternoon, the
committee will submit a list of prospective members to Cardi

nals for their approval. On Wednesday night Excom will ap
prove the nominations and the entire Rally Committee mem
bership will be announced.
Miss Whittemore states that she hopes Rally Com will soon
take on "bigger proportions." According to her the committee
will do a great deal toward "bringing back the old fire" to the
Farm.
Football Coming
Mitguard has announced that there will probably be several
football rallies in late November for the committee to plan.
Basketball season will bring more rallies, stunts, and activities.
According to the ASSU constitution, "all those interested who
believe themselves qualified" may try out for Rally Com. High
school experience will be a good recommendation, Miss Whitte
more declared. However, both committee chairmen want every

one who has a desire to serve Stanford to try lor the group.
Candidates who are not appointed to Rally Com this quarter
will probably have another chance in the spring, they said.
The pre-war membership of Rally Com totaled 36 students.
Although only approximately 20 are being chosen this fall, com
mittee members expect a full-sized Rally Committee by next
fall. If Stanford has a late football season this fall, Rally Com
will organize all stunts and try to form a rooting section. There
will be no card stunts this quarter, however.
Rally Com was important in student activities before 1943.
It handled various student drives as well as athletic stunts.
With the backing of Farm students the committee will reach
its former importance in Stanford life, reorganizers feel. Rally
Com will be essential in building up the Farm's prewar spirit
and unity in backing all activities.

Rally Com was important in student activities before 1943.
It handled various student drives as well as athletic stunts.
With the backing of Farm students the committee will reach
its former importance in Stanford life, reorganizers feel. Rally
Com will be essential in building up the Farm's prewar spirit
and unity in backing all activities.
Interest, enthusiasm, and willingness to work are the qualities
that Rally Committee Chairmen Patty Whittemore and Eugene
Mitguard will seek in tryoutees for the committee this afternoon.
Student candidates will be interviewed in the Excom room of
Old Union today from 1 to 3. Monday from 2 to 4, and Tuesday
from 1 to 3.
Both men and women are urged to try out for Rally Com,
according to the senior members, Miss Whittemore, Mitguard,
Julie Crommelin, and Mary Jane Clatworthy. These four stu
dents will interview the candidates, who must have a*"C"
average.
Lively Interest Tonight
Although the committee needs a few members with artistic

ability, a lively interest in Stanford and student activities is
the main requirement for tryoutees, they said. Mitguard empha
sizes the fact that this year's work will consist almost entirely
of building the Rally Committee to its former place in Farm life.
Students willing to perform the necessary tasks now will be able
to participate in the extensive activities planned for 1946.
Rally Com will consist of twenty members this quarter —the
four seniors now on the committee plus six sophomore and
three junior men, and four sophomore and three junior women.
Six or eight frosh will be placed on a junior committee, and
will have a chance to graduate into full-fledged members if they
prove capable.
Cardinal Approval
After the interviews are completed Tuesday afternoon, the
committee will submit a list of prospective members to Cardi

nals for their approval. On Wednesday night Excom will ap
prove the nominations and the entire Rally Committee mem
bership will be announced.
Miss Whittemore states that she hopes Rally Com will soon
take on "bigger proportions." According to her the committee
will do a great deal toward "bringing back the old fire" to the
Farm.
Football Coming
Mitguard has announced that there will probably be several
football rallies in late November for the committee to plan.
Basketball season will bring more rallies, stunts, and activities.
According to the ASSU constitution, "all those interested who
believe themselves qualified" may try out for Rally Com. High
school experience will be a good recommendation, Miss Whitte
more declared. However, both committee chairmen want every

one who has a desire to serve Stanford to try lor the group.
Candidates who are not appointed to Rally Com this quarter
will probably have another chance in the spring, they said.
The pre-war membership of Rally Com totaled 36 students.
Although only approximately 20 are being chosen this fall, com
mittee members expect a full-sized Rally Committee by next
fall. If Stanford has a late football season this fall, Rally Com
will organize all stunts and try to form a rooting section. There
will be no card stunts this quarter, however.
