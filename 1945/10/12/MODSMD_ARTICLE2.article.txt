## 
### MARION MORROW 
Amid songs, clapping, feet stomping, and the greatest mass good-nature
seen for a long time, Stanford's first peacetime rally passed into Farm
history last night.
Approximately 2,000 frenzied Indians claimed the opportunity to release
war-stinted emotions as tliey trekked down the Row and packed the

Pavilion singing "Come Join the
Band'' with a predominantly AST
baud in accompaniment.
Ric Supple as master of ceremo
nies introduced two coaches and a
surprise guest, Sgt. Tom Casey, with

thusiastic yells led by Newt Arnold,
yell leader.
Supple opened the rally by an
nouncing that Stanford's baseball
coach, Harry Wolter, had been
called away, and introducing the
basketball coach, Everett Dean.
Coach* Dean provoked a laugh by
claiming to "dislike speaking into
a microphone—it's just like kissing
a girl with a veil on." He continued,
"I'm here for three reasons. I'm
looking for basketball players, more
basketball players, and more bas
ketball players."
When he asked for a vote as to
wether the Stanford basketball
team this year should play in the
Pacific Coast League Conference,
or play non-Conference games,
the answer was an overwhelming
"Conference!"
He continued, "If the ability of
the men who have tried out equals
their enthusiasm, energy, ambition,
and spirit, some other team may fin
ish in the cellar of the Pacific
League this year. If we can regain
the spirit exemplified tonight, we
won't have any touble."
j A tremendous ovation greeted
Coach Marchie Schwartz, who said,
"It's a wonderful feeling to be back
where I've had so many pleasant
and wonderful times in the past.
I feel as badly as you do that we're
not having a team, but I'd hate to
have Cal beat us without making
them fight for it."
According to Coach Schwartz,
130 boys have turned out. He
added, "Clark Shaughncssy told
me something about Stanford stu
dents one time and I have found
out it's true. Shaughnessy said,
'There's something funny about
those Stanford students—you al
ways think you have them 70 or
75 per cent ready for a game, and
they always go out and play 10
per cent better than you ex
pected!' "
Sgt. Casey, introduced as "Stan
ford's No. 1 sport fan," led a pow
erful rendition of his own compo
sition, "Give 'em the Axe-eeaa!"
Supple concluded the rally by
asking that "all able-bodied men
report for the teams immediately."

out it's true. Shaughnessy said,
'There's something funny about
those Stanford students—you al
ways think you have them 70 or
75 per cent ready for a game, and
they always go out and play 10
per cent better than you ex
pected!' "
Sgt. Casey, introduced as "Stan
ford's No. 1 sport fan," led a pow
erful rendition of his own compo
sition, "Give 'em the Axe-eeaa!"
Supple concluded the rally by
asking that "all able-bodied men
report for the teams immediately."
Amid songs, clapping, feet stomping, and the greatest mass good-nature
seen for a long time, Stanford's first peacetime rally passed into Farm
history last night.
Approximately 2,000 frenzied Indians claimed the opportunity to release
war-stinted emotions as tliey trekked down the Row and packed the

Pavilion singing "Come Join the
Band'' with a predominantly AST
baud in accompaniment.
Ric Supple as master of ceremo
nies introduced two coaches and a
surprise guest, Sgt. Tom Casey, with
cach introduction followed by en
thusiastic yells led by Newt Arnold,
yell leader.
Supple opened the rally by an
nouncing that Stanford's baseball
coach, Harry Wolter, had been
called away, and introducing the
basketball coach, Everett Dean.
Coach* Dean provoked a laugh by
claiming to "dislike speaking into
a microphone—it's just like kissing
a girl with a veil on." He continued,
"I'm here for three reasons. I'm
looking for basketball players, more
basketball players, and more bas
ketball players."
When he asked for a vote as to
wether the Stanford basketball
team this year should play in the
Pacific Coast League Conference,
or play non-Conference games,
the answer was an overwhelming
"Conference!"
He continued, "If the ability of
the men who have tried out equals
their enthusiasm, energy, ambition,
and spirit, some other team may fin
ish in the cellar of the Pacific
League this year. If we can regain
the spirit exemplified tonight, we
won't have any touble."
j A tremendous ovation greeted
Coach Marchie Schwartz, who said,
"It's a wonderful feeling to be back
where I've had so many pleasant
and wonderful times in the past.
I feel as badly as you do that we're
not having a team, but I'd hate to
have Cal beat us without making
them fight for it."
According to Coach Schwartz,
130 boys have turned out. He
added, "Clark Shaughncssy told
me something about Stanford stu
dents one time and I have found
out it's true. Shaughnessy said,
