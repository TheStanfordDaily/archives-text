FOOD-FOR A PEACE
"More than 100 million Europeans in liber
ated countries will go hungry this winter."
"Next year Americans will consume more food
than ever before in history."
These two statements seen side by side con
stitute one of the greatest ironies of a post-war
world.
"Without food there can be no peace," Gen
eral Eisenhower warns. "There v/ill be eco
nomic and political chaos as well as widespread
starvation in Europe this winter unless the
United States sends the necessary amounts of
food," returning food officials plead.
Yet those who control money and food sup
plies are too conscious of the political effects
of continued rationing on the U.S. public to
see that people who are hungry cannot think
of establishing stable government; that people
who are sick cannot do the necessary work of
repair and reconstruction.
According to the independent experts of the
Food for Freedom Committee at least 15 mil
lion tons of imported foods will be needed next
year to rebuild the health of European peoples
to enable them to start reconstiuction work;
this amount will not restore prewar food stand
ards, but is the minimum required to keep the
people going. Concerning present shipping
schedules the President himself admits that
"these supplies will serve not to improve but
only to sustain the diet of the liberated peoples,
which remains below the minimum level of
subsistence."
The problem now, the President also admits,
is not one of shipping space or supplies, but
of finances. Europe is at the point where a finan
cial problem that blocks food shipping will be
disastrous. Proof of America's acceptance of
a basic responsibility can come only through
Administration insistence upon prompt grant
of ample allocations to UNRRA; quick financial
arrangements wiih liberated countries as a stop
gap after end of lend-lease; much larger allo
cations of food to Europe immediately—even if
it means continuation of rationing at home.
