To ease the frustrated Stanford mind, we're
going to drone today on "What Happens to Tui
tion Fees," or "$143 Down the Drain."
Number one drain on campus is the one in the
fountain in front of the Libe. Without this highly
specialized and valiant little drain, the upper tier
on the fountain would keep overflowing into
the lower tier, and the lower tier would just
overflow all over the place. It'd keep the gym
teachers busy, of course, creating courses in
elementary gondola-poling, and advanced
classes for exchange students. Of course they
could eliminate expense by turning the water
off entirely and turning the fountain into a wad
ing pool—upper basin reserved for faculty mem
bers, natch.
The second big drain on campus is the one
in the bottom of Lake Lagunita. Outside of pay
ing the little man who pulls the plug every
spring, there isn't much expense involved here,
since the University has a contract with the Paly
Water Corporation. The Water Works pipes
the water out through the drain, adds a tank or
two of chlorine, and voila! Stanford drinks for
another year.
Then there's the Stanford highly electralized

law and order department. For example, the
alarms attached to each grapefruit on Quad.
All you have to do is pick one, and a little bell
rings, takes down your name, address, and bawl
out average. Many's the war-time Squaw who
toted one of these accomplished little cusses to
a Roble or Lagunita formal. Not so handsome,
but they do make with conversation in their
slightly mechanical way.
Of course the keeper of the lights in the Hoo
ver Tower has to be paid a fat salary. Climbing
sixteen flights of stairs every night with a light
ed candle is no small trick. Then there's the
upward trek at 5 the next morning to blow the
candle out.
The alarm clock in the Civ libe is another
item—s2.so, University Pharmacy. That takes
care of one-fifty-seventh of the value of one
Freshman.
Those windows on the ceiling of the Ad Build
ing cost, too. The man who is permanently
perched up there keeping every little pane in
line has to get flight pay. Then there's the ex
pens of parachuting him provisions very week.
Then there's the auxiliary hospital that has to
be set up every Reg Day. This is quite an item,
considering that most of the casualties come be
fore the victim has reached the tuition window.
Then he's a total loss to the University.
All this, plus a few professors and buildings,
for $143.

out average. Many's the war-time Squaw who
toted one of these accomplished little cusses to
a Roble or Lagunita formal. Not so handsome,
but they do make with conversation in their
slightly mechanical way.
Of course the keeper of the lights in the Hoo
ver Tower has to be paid a fat salary. Climbing
sixteen flights of stairs every night with a light
ed candle is no small trick. Then there's the
upward trek at 5 the next morning to blow the
candle out.
The alarm clock in the Civ libe is another
item—s2.so, University Pharmacy. That takes
care of one-fifty-seventh of the value of one
Freshman.
Those windows on the ceiling of the Ad Build
ing cost, too. The man who is permanently
perched up there keeping every little pane in
line has to get flight pay. Then there's the ex
pens of parachuting him provisions very week.
Then there's the auxiliary hospital that has to
be set up every Reg Day. This is quite an item,
considering that most of the casualties come be
fore the victim has reached the tuition window.
Then he's a total loss to the University.
All this, plus a few professors and buildings,
for $143.
To ease the frustrated Stanford mind, we're
going to drone today on "What Happens to Tui
tion Fees," or "$143 Down the Drain."
Number one drain on campus is the one in the
fountain in front of the Libe. Without this highly
specialized and valiant little drain, the upper tier
on the fountain would keep overflowing into
the lower tier, and the lower tier would just
overflow all over the place. It'd keep the gym
teachers busy, of course, creating courses in
elementary gondola-poling, and advanced
classes for exchange students. Of course they
could eliminate expense by turning the water
off entirely and turning the fountain into a wad
ing pool—upper basin reserved for faculty mem
bers, natch.
The second big drain on campus is the one
in the bottom of Lake Lagunita. Outside of pay
ing the little man who pulls the plug every
spring, there isn't much expense involved here,
since the University has a contract with the Paly
Water Corporation. The Water Works pipes
the water out through the drain, adds a tank or
two of chlorine, and voila! Stanford drinks for
another year.
Then there's the Stanford highly electralized

law and order department. For example, the
alarms attached to each grapefruit on Quad.
All you have to do is pick one, and a little bell
rings, takes down your name, address, and bawl
out average. Many's the war-time Squaw who
