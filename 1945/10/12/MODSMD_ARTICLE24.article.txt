The question of the atomic bomb still remains
as a sword over everybody's peace of mind. In
this stage, all that can be done is to theorize
about it. But still, there is one possibility that
cannot be overlooked.
It is that the atomic bomb, instead of revo
lutionizing warfare, will make it more conven
tional.
THEORY OF WAR
Twentieth Century war has undergone a ter
rific change, not only in methods but in aims and
theory. Before, the basis of war was expressed
in Clausewitz's doctrine that national conflict
was the final instrument of foreign policy, the
last medicine in a diplomat's cabinet, so to
speak. Thus, the army existed for the state, and
its function was that of a tool to be used by the
body politics in gaining its international ends.
But now that has changed. The modern the
orists (Ludendorff, for example) think or thought
in terms of the state and all its resources as sub
ject to the army, of the army dictating the for
eign policy and not just carrying it out, and of
war for survival in which no holds were barred.
PRACTICE OF WAR
The strategic bomber also changed war. Be
fore, the only way to thoroughly win a war was
to destroy the other side's army in conflict. Now
that can be done by blowing up the enemy's
source of supply.
However, by digging your industry under
ground, you can overcome tne effects of bomb
ers and atom bombs. Moreover, this is possible.
The Germans, with a crippled production ca
pacity and little time, had locomotive under
ground. Certainly a state with plenty of time
and plenty of credit could do the same only
more thoroughly and better.
CHANGE IN WAR
Normally, a state would rely on large fleets
of interceptors for security, and therefore the
opening stages of campaigns are aerial battles,
with the winner pummeling the loser's industry.
But now, with atomic bombs, if a fighter fleet
shot down 3500 out of 3600 bombers with mini
mum losses to itself, the 100 remaining could
still wreck a nation's industrial potential, if it
was above the surface.

PEACETIME POLICIES
For that reason, the state will adopt a peace
time policy of duplicating its industry under
ground and caching V-bombs and long-range
bombers in sub-surface hangars. Thus, industry
will be immune, and the only use of bombing
other than that which is described as "tactical"
will be to harass civilian populations and de
stroy communications. The latter is something
that's extremely difficult to do, and will be more
so if a cheaper method of making tracked ve
hicles is developed.
But, you say, atom bombs might still be used
to destroy whole cities. Yet, this would bring
retaliation in kind, if long range bombers capa
ble of striking back were protected, so it would
not be decisive.
END OF ANNIHILATION WARFARE
However, if a state were facing national anni
hilation for the sake of a province, because mili
tary fortunes might change, the province
could be gained back in twenty years. For that
reason, statesmen will think of war in terms of
limited gain, not total annihilation, and war will
go back to being an instrument of limited-gain
designed foreign policy. It will also revert to
striking at armies instead of cities, because even
aerial supremacy could not blow up the means
of production. Thus, the atomic bomb might just
possibly tend to conventionalize instead of rev
olutionize warfare.
