# Freshman Tells of Wartime England, Daily Buzz Bombs, Crumbling Cellars
## 'Yanks Seemed to Outnumber English,' Says Robleite; Poor Food Was Biggest Gripe; Involved Queues, Custards 
### PAULA NUSSER 
"That English custard! It 'was by
far the most distgusting thing about
the whole war."
This is hardly the answer one
would expect from a young Canad
ian girl who had seen service dur
ing the Battle of Britain in 1940
and had been subjected to the fury
of the German buzz bombs during
the last year of the war. Yet Miriam
Weston, now a Roble freshman, was
inclined to put greater stress on the
scanty, unappetizing English food
than on the constant danger that
confronted her during the last six
years of war.
Move to England
In 1934 Mr. and Mrs. Weston had
moveu their large family of nine
children from a comfortable Ca
nadian home in Vancouver to the
small town of Buckinghamshire, 30
miles north of London. The chil
dren had lived a very noi'mal life
attending school in London until the
danger of bombing in Sept., 1939
forced the government to evacuate
all school children, and to draft all
young women eligible for military
service. Miriam was called up for
duty by the Labor Exchange, the
English counterpart for our Selec
tive Service, and was placed as a
secretary in the Canadian Military
Headquarters.
"I must admit that during those
first few months of the Battle of
Britain I was a little shaky," Miriam
said. "If you could have seen our
inadequate air raid shelters you
would have understood. The shelter
of my London residence was noth
ing more than a basement of stone
and cement. A near miss would
have been all that was needed to
bring the whole house down on top
of us. There was nothing in the

basement even resembling a chair
or a bed, and from midnight to 4
a.m. every night, I would vainly
try to sleep on the top of a kitchen
table.'
Custard a Sore Point
The prime topic of food again re
entered Miriam's conversation. She
stated that perhaps the most plenti
ful dishes in England were pigeon,
juggeu hare, and the ever present
custard made of powder and water,
devoid of any milk or eggs. "I still
can't look at your rich American
custards without shuddering a lit
tle," confessed Miriam. She men
tioned that the R.A.F. pilots were
rumored to have thrown cases of
the custard out over Gei'many in
retribution.
"Queueing up for everything was a
constant sore spot to the average
Britisher." Miriam paused and
chuckled. "Oh yes, I'm always for
getting you Americans. Queueing up
means standing in line. Whether
it was for groceries, clothing, or
amusements, you could never es
cape the inevitable line."
Natives Outnumbered
The thought upper-most in the
minds of all Londoners after 1941
was the question of where all the
British went and where all the Am
ericans came from. "Americans
seemed to far outnumber the na
tives," Miriam stated, "but the
people of the British Isles were, for
the most part, genuinely glad to see
them. For example, two of my clos
est girl friends who had formerly
been strongly anti-American finally
cemented relations by marrying two
boys from Texas."
The young Canadian girl said that
she had experienced a few near hits
but that the most exciting event
that had happened to her was wit
nessing the shooting down of a Ger

man plane. She said that she was
walking through Hyde Park when
shells and splinters from the anti
aircraft guns caused her to take
shelter under a convenient arch.
Direclly above her she watched
searchlights trap a lonely Jerry
plane and saw it fall in flames not
far from her shelter.
Doodle Bomb Visits
"The German buzz bombs — we
called them doodle bombs — were
perhaps more terrifying than the
German bombers had been. You
never knew when they were com
ing," Miriam said. "At night as I
lay in bed I could look out the
window and see the lights on the
bombs. As the lights came nearer
and their roar, somewhat like that
of a car, became more audible, I
would scarcely breathe. I'd pray
that the noise would continue, for
the minute their motors were cut,
they would start gliding and fall."
V-E Day caught Miriam and her
family boarding a ship for the
United States. She commented that
seeing America was like discover
ing a new country again. "The
thing that impressed me most was
the abundant energy you people had,
little dulled by a gruelling war,"
Miriam said seriously. Then she
smiled a little and went on, "To be
perfectly honest, I was awfully glad
to gel back to a country that not
only had lots of energy, but lots to
wear and eat."
