## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 11 (UP).—Jean He
rold Paquis, the French "Lord Haw-
Haw," was shot by a firing squad
today, and a Ministry of Justice of-
said that the execution of for
mer Vichy Premier Pierre Laval
would be postponed until Gen.
Charles DeGaulle returns from
Brussels.
"DeGaulle is in the habit of re
viewing all high court verdicts
personally," the official said, "even
when the defendant refuses to sign
an appeal, as Laval has done."
Laval was sentenced to be shot
Tuesday for treason and having in
telligence with the enemy.
Paquis, whose pro-Nazi broadcasts
made him one of the mosl-liated of
the French collaborators, was shot
with four members of the White
Russian section of the Nazi Gestapo
at Fort De Chatillon, where Joseph
Darnand, former chief of the Vichy
militia, met his end before a filing
squad yesterday.
It now appears unlikely that Laval
will be executed before the end of
next week, even if DeGaulle refuses
| the new trial which Laval's lawyers
j are demanding.
