# Rally Spirit Results In Reckless Driving
## 
### 
In the excitement of a big rally,
it's easy to get a little carried
away. That's fine, until it reaches
the point where it's dangerous.
Last night, in the parade over
to the Pavilion, three or four cars
pushed their way into the middle
of the procession. Terribly load
ed down with fellows and girls,
these cars (apparently driven by)
juveniles) seemed to get a great
kick out of tearing up to the
people in front of them, and then
stopping barely in time to avoid
hitting those in front of them, who
bad to run to get out of the way
as it was.
Most students will agree that
we have had enough serious au
tomobile accidents at Stanford.
Those who can't drive in a sane
manner don't belong here.
Sincerely,
CIIARMIAN KOLAR.
