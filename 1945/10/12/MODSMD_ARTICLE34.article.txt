# Sports The Stanford Daily
## SIDELINE SLANTS 
### Art Levinson 
Now that the World Series is past history, (but the pocketbook
still aches) we can devote our entire time to football. (One of the
reasbns the Daily Board of Grid Experts didn't do so well last
week is that their minds were partially on the results of the big
baseball games.)
And for the first time in three years, Stanfordites don't have
to poke their noses very far to find a football squad in operation.
Right on the Farm Marchie Schwartz begins frills on Monday.
We can say almost absolutely that some games will be played
v/ith service teams. Who those service teams will be is a mys
tery right now, but Mr. Alfred Masters, Grad Manager, shouldn't
have much trouble lining up some teams of comparable strength.
Stanford is indeed fortunate in having a coach of such high
caliber as Marchie Schwartz. Not only is he one of the best foot
ball fundamentalists, but also as a person, he's one grand guy.
FOOTBALL IDEAS
His ideas about football might well be worth repeating. To
him there is more to the game than a lot or rah rah glory. Foot
ball is a sport which enables the young man to develop physi
cally and mentally. As physical training, the game is par ex
cellence; as a means for contacts and working together with a
group of fellows, he believes football is even more valuable.
"There's nothing more important than a fellow being able to mix
v/ith a group in a congenial way," Schwartz stated.
Willie Maxwel, Papoose mentor in '42, is a product of the
Schwartz school. He played at Creighton while Schwartz was
tutoring the team, and was one of the finest backs in the Mid
west. Maxwel is now working in the rehabilitation program at
Dibble Hospital, and is doing a whale of a good job.
It was Maxwel's idea to send those blind fellows back "to see"
the World Series, and he's trying to arrange a similar trip to the
Army-Navy game for another group of blind veterans.
NO ASSISTANTS YET
The problem of getting some assistants is still bothering
Marchmont. Vic Lindskog is participating in the play-for-pay
circuit back East, and other previous assistants are in the Armed
Services. Some arrangement, however, might be worked out
with Willie Maxwel to help put the squad into shape.
FEEDBOX GAB
Took a gander at the Racing Form the other day, and there
are really some hot nags hitting it off at Hollypark. Good ones
to watch are Bushel Basket and April Moon.
Our official Horse and Handbook man, Longshot Luna, wants
everyone to know that Bay Meadows is starting a 2-5 lab every
afternoon on October 23. But tuition is awfully high.
