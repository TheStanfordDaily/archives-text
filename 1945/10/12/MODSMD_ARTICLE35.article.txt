# 1942 Cardinal Squad Finished 3rd in PCC
## 
### BOB GILKEY 
As Coach Marchie Schwartz pre
pares to send his first postwar In
dian eleven down the gridiron war
path, he can look with justifiable
pride at his initial season as head
coach on the Farm —that brilliant
1942 season when he molded an im
potent team which lost its first three
games into a powerful, smooth
functioning squad which was rated
the most powerful eleven on the
Coast at the end of the season.
When Mr. Schwartz succeeded
Jim Lawson as top man, he took
charge of an aggregation powerful
in line strength but minus the serv
ices of the immortal Frankie Albert
and Pete Kmetovic, spearheads of
the '41 Indian backfield. The new
mentor faced his biggest job in
building the untried backs into a
polished scoring combination, and
his task looked hopeless as Stan
ford went down to defeat in its first
three contests. Washington State's
powerful Cougars edged the Cardi
nals, 6-0, in the opener, and the
next week found Santa Clara
whacking Stanford, 14-6. Schwartz
homecoming to his old Alma Mater,
Notre Dame, was marred by the
magnificent hurling of Angelo Ber
telli, Fighting Irish Ail-American,
who pitched four touchdown passes
to give his team a 27-0 victory and
send Stanford crashing down to its
third straight loss.
The next Saturday gave evi
dence of things to come: a slightly
favored Stanford eleven swamped
Idaho's hapless Vandals, 54-7, to
set a new Stanford Stadium scor
ing record. To be sure. Idaho was
no national champion, but the
lop-sided triumph made the ex
perts sit up and take notice of
Marchie Schwartz' rejuvenated
varsity.
Southern Cal, fresh from a 26-12
win over previously unbeaten
Washington State, came north the
next week confident of an easy tri
umph. But the new T-formation
terror was on a march, and the

Trojans were mowed under in a
stunning upset, 14-6. But the Rose
Bowl fever which was sweeping the
Farm came to a sudden halt as Bob
Waterfield and Bowl-bound Uclans
downed the Schwartzmen, 20-7. But
the new Stanford offense came
thundering back with a 20-7 deci
sion over Washington and a 49-13
slaughter of Oregon State's defend
ing champions.
November 23 — the last Big
Game and a mighty sweet one
for Mr. Schwartz and his hoys.
As the gun cracked to end the
game, the scoreboard showed a
2(1-7 margin for the Cardinals, and
the Axe came home to Stanford.
As an anti-climax to the Big
Game win, the Indians, with "win
tliis one for Marchie" as their war
cry, handed St. Mary's Pre-Flight
a 28-13 licking for their fifth vic
tory in the last six starts.
