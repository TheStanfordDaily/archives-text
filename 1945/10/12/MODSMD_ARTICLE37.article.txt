the boys, explaining to them its of
fensive potentialities. Today both
the civilians and the Navy get their
uniforms, and on Monday Coach
Marchmont takes the boys out to
the field for their first workout.

It has been learned that all N.R.-
O.T.C. grid men will be allowed to
play against service teams this year,
regardless of their collegiate stand
