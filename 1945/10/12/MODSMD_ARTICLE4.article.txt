# Mac Arthur Breaks Jap Traditions
## 
### 
TOKYO, Oct. 11 (UP). —Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur smashed cen
turies of Japanese tradition today
by promulgating a five-point pro
gram establishing women's suffrage
and free religion, liberalizing edu
cation, abolishing the secret police,
and demoralizing industry.
This blueprint of Japan's future
was made known to Premier Baron
Kijuro Shidehara when he made his
first official call at Mac Arthur's
headquarters this afternoon.
Social Order Corrected
"In achievement of the Potsdam
declaration, the traditional social
order under which the Japanese
people for centuries have been sub
jugated will be corrected," Mac A
rthur told him. "This unquestion
ably will involve a liberalization of
the constitution."
Shortly afterward, the Imperial
Household Ministry announced the
appointment of two advisers to the
Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. This,
observers believed, presaged imme
diate revision of the constitution.
Sasaki Is Adviser
One of the advisers, Dr. Soichi
Sasaki, is an honorary professor at
Kyoto Imperial University and an
outstanding expert on the Japanese
constitution. The other is Prince
Fumimaro Konoye, former premier
and one of the emperor's close ad
visers.
(NBC correspondent Guthrie
Janssen said the appointments
caused a sensation and were inter
preted in Japanese circles as mean
ing the constitution would be re
vised to permit Emperor Hirohito to
abdicate.)
Conference Lasts Hour
Shidehara's conference with Mac-
Arthur lasted for about an hour.
Headquarters immediately issued
the text of Mac Arthur's program for
social reform.
"The people must be freed from
all forms of governmental secret in
quisition into their daily lives which
holds their minds in virtual slav
ery," it said, "and from all forms
of control which seek to suppress
freedom of thought, freedom of
speech, and freedom of religion.
"Regimentation of the masses un
der guise of a claim of efficiency,
under whatever name of govern
ment it may be, must cease."

BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 11 (UP).—
Seven hundred army and navy offi
cers met tonight at the Military
Club and usually well - informed
quarters reported that they decided
to ask President Edelmiro J. Far
rell to dismiss his entire cabinet as
the first move toward constitutional
elections.
This development came as the
government announced that elec
tions will be held April 7.
Informants said that it was in
dicated the officers favored turn
ing over governmental power to
the supreme court — a measure
authorized by the constitution—
as the first step toward returning
the country to normal.
The officers sent a note explaining
(heir stand to the powerful Campo
de Mayo garrison outside Buenos
Aires.
Two envoys, an army captain
and a civilian representative of
university students — leaders in
protests against the government
as (he result of which Vice-Presi
dent Col. Juan D. Peron resigned
—were dispatched to the camp
with the note, informants said.
This was the first joint move by
the army and civilian elements, as
represented by the students, in a
situation which promised to develop
rapidly.

Kijuro Shidehara when he made his
first official call at Mac Arthur's
headquarters this afternoon.
Social Order Corrected
"In achievement of the Potsdam
declaration, the traditional social
order under which the Japanese
people for centuries have been sub
jugated will be corrected," Mac A
rthur told him. "This unquestion
ably will involve a liberalization of
the constitution."
Shortly afterward, the Imperial
Household Ministry announced the
appointment of two advisers to the
Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. This,
observers believed, presaged imme
diate revision of the constitution.
Sasaki Is Adviser
One of the advisers, Dr. Soichi
Sasaki, is an honorary professor at
Kyoto Imperial University and an
outstanding expert on the Japanese
constitution. The other is Prince
Fumimaro Konoye, former premier
and one of the emperor's close ad
visers.
(NBC correspondent Guthrie
Janssen said the appointments
caused a sensation and were inter
preted in Japanese circles as mean
ing the constitution would be re
vised to permit Emperor Hirohito to
abdicate.)

Arthur lasted for about an hour.
Headquarters immediately issued
the text of Mac Arthur's program for
social reform.
"The people must be freed from
all forms of governmental secret in
quisition into their daily lives which
holds their minds in virtual slav
ery," it said, "and from all forms
of control which seek to suppress
freedom of thought, freedom of
speech, and freedom of religion.
"Regimentation of the masses un
der guise of a claim of efficiency,
under whatever name of govern
ment it may be, must cease."
