of play yesterday as definite champ
ionship contenders loomed on the
horizon in each of the three cir
cuits.
Kappa-Dec Gees Look Strong

but Fillmore Hall and Encina 111 are
still very much in the running.

the passing of Joe Shcr and the
pass-snagging of Ed Luce and Ric

column for the victors as he pulled

mighty rugged gridder, turned in
some bone-crushing blocking for
the Kappa-Dee Gees.
