# Alumni Review Editors Plan Postwar Changes
## 
### BETTY BARLOW 
The Alumni Review was organ
ized about 50 years ago as one of
the first illustrated magazines in the
United States. It was then called
the Stanford Alumnus. Later the
name was changed to the Illustxated
Review, and more recently to the
present day title.
Since the war is over, changes
will be made in the contents of the
magazine. Fewer war letters will
be published, and space will be used
to describe Stanford's reconversion
to inler-collegiate sports and other
new developments.
Published by Alumni
The Alumni Review is published
by the Alumni Association for $50
a life membership if purchased while
attending Stanford, and $60 if sub
scribed to after graduation. Neal

of the Association, and Virginia
Hobbs, class of '45, is assistant editor

area, is through this magazine.

news, faculty changes, campus op
enings, editorials from the Daily,
controversial issues, releases from

of the Association, and Virginia

area, is through this magazine.
The Review publishes university
news, faculty changes, campus op
enings, editorials from the Daily,
controversial issues, releases from
the Army and Navy public relations
departments that concern former
students, and club news. The editors
follow local papers for items about
Stanford, and urge alumni to send
news in.
