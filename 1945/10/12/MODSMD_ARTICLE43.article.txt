"Pride of the Marines," the story
of Al Schmidt, now at the Stanford,
is exceptional.

Jumping the gun
on the "veteran
returning home"
theme, "Pride of
the Marines" has
an amazingly
realistic treatment
that the rest of
the industry will
have to try hard
to pop.
Schmidt, played

by John Garfield, is a fiercely inde
pendent ordinary man with a job in
a factory and a passion for hunting
rather than being hunted .... he
fears being trapped into marriage
by his match-making friends.
He totters on the brink when the
attack on Pearl Harbor is announced
and falls into the pit as he boards
the train to enter the Marines.
Guadalcanal, waiting, mud, and
Japs makes Schmidt and his
friend Lee, Dane Clark, heros, but
it costs Schmidt his sight. His
struggle to admit to himself that
he may never see again, takes
the form of determination that he
will not marry nor return to his
friends in Philadelphia.
It takes a fall over a Christmas
tree the day before he is awarded
the Navy Cross to give Schmidt
the ce-urage to go ahead with his
pre-war plans. Perhaps it's opti
mistic, but "Pride of the Marines"
is weli done.
"The Gay Senorita," (the title
must refer to Jinx Faulkenburg),
may have been gay, but she was far
from convincing. Miss Faulkenburg

lookea slightly surprised to find her
self off a poster and in a Mexican
community.
The Spanish music was good, but
a little overpowering. It was nice
to hear English again.—Ayres.
