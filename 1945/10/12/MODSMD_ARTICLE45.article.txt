# Fuel Supply Threatened
## Rationing Not Likely However, Says Ickes 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11.—(UP).—
Fuel Administrator Harold L. Ickes
said today that it probably will not
be necessary to ration either fuel
oil or coal, despite the fact that
the soft coal strike is costing the
nation more than 1,000,000 tons a
day.
J. D. Small, head of the new
civilian production administration,
said he already had set up machin
ery to ration manufactured gas to
industrial users if the strike con
tinues to reduce supplies. He said
domestic consumers would not be
affected.
May Ration Gas
"I hope it will not be necessary
to ration gas, but we are prepared
with a program to handle it if it
does," he said.
Secretary of Labor Lewis B.
Schwellenbach meanwhile carried to
the deadlocked coal negotiating con
ference President Truman's hope
that the strike can be ended prompt
ly. After reporting to Mr. Truman
on the negotiations, Schwellenbach
said:
"The president, told me he was
very anxious for the miners and
operators to get together."
The conferees adjourned until to
morrow morning after another day
of fruitless discussions.
Solid Fuels
The Solid Fuels administration re
ported meanwhile that the strike
idled 187,037 men in 870 mines to
day, with a production loss of 1,-
044,403 tons. Total production loss
since the walkout began Sept. 21
was 8,641,717 tons.
The parties are attempting to
settle a dispute over recognition of
the United Mine Workers as bar
gaining agent for soft coal super
visory employes. The conferences
were in their fifth day, with neither
side showing evidence of yielding.
307 Notices Filed
The National Labor Relations
Board reported that 307 strike
notices were filed in September and
81 strike votes taken. It said 319
cases were pending as of Oct. 1.
Ickes said the coal strike's chief
impact is on .steel production and
publie utilities. Solid fuels admin
istration officials have warned that
the loss of coal threatens to reduce
steel operations to 25 per cent of
capacity by this weekend, with se
rious effects on reconversion.
Ickes foresaw no immediate pros
pect of rationing coal for domestic
consumers, but he added that "no
one can see the possibilities of a
prolonged strike."
