# Share Atomic Secret Urges Farm Physicist
## 
### TEDDY FITCH 
Urging that we share our atomic
bomb secret with other nations, Dr.
William W. Hansen of the Stanford

Physics Department spoke on atomic
power and its development in the
first meeting of the Stanford Re
search Club Wednesday night.
Development of Nuclear Theory
Beginning in 1905 with Einstein's
theory that mass and energy are
equivalent, the nuclear theory
gradually developed, stated the
physics professor. In 15)19, Sir Ernest
Rutherford first bombarded nitrogen
atoms and charged them into oxy
gen atoms. This led the way in
1932 for James Chadwick's discov
ery of the neutron, a particle having
mass but no electrical charge. An
effective agent in transmutations, the
neutron can slip easily through the
powerful electric shields of heavy
atoms.
i Fission Theory
The theory of fission that a
bombarded uranium atom broke in
to two fragmentsâ€”was developed in
I 1938. Thus, matter was converted
into energy; supporting Einstein's
theory, said Dr. Hansen. The bom
bardment, moreover, could produce
a chain of further neutron fissions
yielding tremendous energy. It be
came obvious, he concluded, that a
bomb could be made in this manner.
The practibility of uranium as a
source of power would depend,
claimed Dr. Hansen, on the use to

which it was put. It may be prac
tical, he added, to shorten an ex
pensive war with it, but would be
too costly for heating your water.
Can We Keep the Atom Secret?
In answer to a question, Dr. Han
sen declared that the secret of the
atomic bomb cannot be kept. The
United States, he said, doesn't have
a monopoly on brains and the lines
of research have been clearly estab
lished. Within two to five years, he
adder, other nations will share our
secret. Dr. Hansen went on to say
that keeping the secret of the bomb
would only breed fear and bad feel
ing among foreign nations. "Give
the secret," he stated, "to anybody
who asks for it, provided they will
satisfy us they will not use it against
us."
As to the theory of saving the
world by retribution with the bomb,
Dr. Hansen commented dryly, "No
bel had a similar hope about dyna
mite "
Dr. Hansen, famed for his work
in radar, returned to the campus
in July after five years as a re
search engineer with Spcrry Gyro
scope Co. in New York. Last year,
Dr. Hansen was awarded the 1944
Morris Liebmann Memorial Prize
for outstanding achievement in radio
engineering.
