### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 (UP).—A
defense has been developed against
the atomic bomb, it was hinted
today, as Secretary of Commerce
Henry A. Wallace asserted that the
United States would be inviting dis
aster by encouraging "a policy of
secrecy on atomic energy."
Neils Bohr, the Danish scientist
who was whisked from the Nazis'
grasp to help develop the bomb in
this country, also contended that
atomic energy and all other awe
some scientific developments must
be subject to international control.
Naval Affairs Report
The hint of a defense against the
atomic bomb was contained in a
House Naval Affairs Committee re
port which said:
''There are indications that an ef
fective counter-measure to atomic
bombs has been developed to such
an extent that they can be exploded
far short of their objective without
the necessity of locating their posi
tion.
"Knowledge of electronics prom
ises ability to detonate atomic bombs
at a great distance by radio. Such
interceptive defense can be effected
at the greatest distances from our
shores by the Navy."

Wallace appeared before a joint
Senate Military Affairs and Com
merce subcommittee conducting
hearings on bills to establish a na
tional science research foundation.
The House Military Affairs Com
mittee meanwhile recessed until
next Tuesday without acting on a
bill based upon President Truman's
request for a nine-member commis
sion to govern all phases of domes
tic research and production of atom
ic energy.
Wallace testified that Russia is
placing "extraordinary emphasis" on
scientific research which is "bound
to produce extraordinary results in
time."
