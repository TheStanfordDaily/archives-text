# Field Day Planned For Women Today
## 
### 
One of the first events of the year
planned by the WAA is the Field
Day to be held in the Women's
Gymnasium this afternoon from 3
to 5:30.
Mary Thompson, vice-presiUent of
WAA and chairman of the Field
Day, announced that the program
for the afternoon would begin with
volleyball and the showing of the
movies of Stanford taken by Pathe
Newu two years ago. During the
afternoon there will be obstacle
races, five-legged races, and a wheel
barrow race. For those who want
to swim the pool will be open from
3 to 4:30, but swimmers will have
to take their own suits and caps,

according to Miss Thompson.
Alice Lovett, president of WAA,
said that the purpose of the Field
Day is to acquaint new women stu
dents—freshmen, transfers, and ofT
campus students—with each other,
with WAA, and with Stanford.
During the afternoon refreshments
will be served.
Later this fall tri-sport days with
Mills. Cal, and Stanford will re
turn.
