# THE 						STANFORD DOLLAR
## 
### 
Since the start of this quarter when women students paid
$192.50 for room and board, an increase of 57.50 over spring
quarter fees, we've overheard a growing amount of comment
leading up to "What's the deal?"
Here are the actual facts on where your money goes:
At Stanford University, as well as throughout the nation, the
price of living has swollen during the war and will continue to
rise during the immediate postwar period. Supplies, raw food
costs and salaries have mounted to the point where rates also
have to mount, or a substantial deficit will be marked on the
books.
A survey based on Lagunita and Roble Halls shows the fol
lowing percentages of increase over 1940-41 costs: 1941-42,
2 per cent; 1942- 43, 14 per cent; 1943-44, 20 per cent; 1944-45,
24 per cent.
This means that in 1945 and 1946 your $192.50 will be used
to pay for room and board costs that have grown over one
fourth larger than they were before the war.
"For what else are our fees used besides food and salaries?"
is ("mother question.
One important and little-known item is depreciation. What
depreciation means in terms of you and your interests is this:
a small part of the money you pay is set aside to insure future
generations of Stanford students of living quarters up to the
standard that they are today. It means that Roble, Hurlburt
House, any of the residences on campus won't be allowed to
become run-down and shabby. It means that new houses will
take the place of those which are outmoded. Principally it
means that your children will find a Stanford changed only for
the better by the years.
These are a few sidelights on your room and board rates.
Discussion of other questions relating to the Stanford dollar will
be presented in future Daily issues this quarter. —N. S.
