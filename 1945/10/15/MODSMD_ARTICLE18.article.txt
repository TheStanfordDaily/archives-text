Let's take a look at the stockinged legs vs. shockinged legs
controversy. Admitted, twisted hunks of rayon make for more
concentrated attention to book l'arnin\ Now let's look at the
other side.
This isn't the opinion of one person, rather it's a gulped poll
tabulated at a University dining table (independently red).
The hostess, recognizing her duty to keep the people at her
table from paying too much attention to what they were eating,
started things going. "How'll we keep the things up?"
"Ughhhh!" There was a table-wide grunt of mutual under
standing.
"There are always knee garters." The hostess couldn't let
her topic fall flat before they'd even finished their soup.
"Garters—Lord, every Stanford vein, a big, bright varicose
one."
No one at the table knew more about veins other than that
they ran up and down in the pickled frogs in Bio 1, so they
gasped. "You mean—veins will pop out all around our gar
ters?"
"And that ain't all," snarled the garter radical. "After a while,
your veins will pop out so far, that you'll have to wear rubber
pressure bands."
The viciousness of the whole proposed act was beginning
to dawn on the whole table, and they chomped their spoon
bread fiercely.
"Ahhh! The plot begins to clear now. They'll force us to
wear garters until we get varicose veins. Then we'll have to
v/ear rubber pressure bands, and stockings to cover the bands—
probably black cotton stockings. After that will come the long
dresses to cover the black stockings."
"Post-war prudence, bah!"
"But are you sure garters give you varicose veins?" This
skeptic was doubtless a spy from the enemy camp.
"If it's history you want, here it comes. When man was
happy and simple, he went around wearing hunks of bear skin
and skirts and stuff. But then along came George Washington
and decided that this wasn't exactly coy. So he started wearing
J', nee pants and knee garters.
"It wasn't long after that that men started lengthening their
jeans. They won't admit it, but it was just to cover their vari
cose veins. Now they've got their cuffs clear down to the floor
and their garters clear down to their ankles. Man won't call
himself civilized until he's wearing booties attached to his cuffs.
Bah!"
Their last spoonful of rice pudding had been gulped, so they
all stampeded for the living room and the Chronicle.

happy and simple, he went around wearing hunks of bear skin
and skirts and stuff. But then along came George Washington
and decided that this wasn't exactly coy. So he started wearing
J', nee pants and knee garters.
"It wasn't long after that that men started lengthening their
jeans. They won't admit it, but it was just to cover their vari
cose veins. Now they've got their cuffs clear down to the floor
and their garters clear down to their ankles. Man won't call
himself civilized until he's wearing booties attached to his cuffs.
Bah!"
Their last spoonful of rice pudding had been gulped, so they
all stampeded for the living room and the Chronicle.
Let's take a look at the stockinged legs vs. shockinged legs
controversy. Admitted, twisted hunks of rayon make for more
concentrated attention to book l'arnin\ Now let's look at the
other side.
This isn't the opinion of one person, rather it's a gulped poll
tabulated at a University dining table (independently red).
The hostess, recognizing her duty to keep the people at her
table from paying too much attention to what they were eating,
started things going. "How'll we keep the things up?"
"Ughhhh!" There was a table-wide grunt of mutual under
standing.
"There are always knee garters." The hostess couldn't let
her topic fall flat before they'd even finished their soup.
"Garters—Lord, every Stanford vein, a big, bright varicose
one."
No one at the table knew more about veins other than that
they ran up and down in the pickled frogs in Bio 1, so they
gasped. "You mean—veins will pop out all around our gar
ters?"
"And that ain't all," snarled the garter radical. "After a while,
your veins will pop out so far, that you'll have to wear rubber
pressure bands."
The viciousness of the whole proposed act was beginning
to dawn on the whole table, and they chomped their spoon
bread fiercely.
"Ahhh! The plot begins to clear now. They'll force us to
wear garters until we get varicose veins. Then we'll have to
v/ear rubber pressure bands, and stockings to cover the bands—
probably black cotton stockings. After that will come the long
dresses to cover the black stockings."
"Post-war prudence, bah!"
"But are you sure garters give you varicose veins?" This
skeptic was doubtless a spy from the enemy camp.
"If it's history you want, here it comes. When man was
happy and simple, he went around wearing hunks of bear skin
and skirts and stuff. But then along came George Washington
