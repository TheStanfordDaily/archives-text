Musical Notes
Jump on it! Sit on it! Bend it!
Send it through Keg Day! It won't
break! With advertising similar to
this, the R.C.A. Victor Record Co.,
introduced their new, non-breakable
disc by issuing Richard Strauss'
"Till Eulenspiegel," cut on the mod
ern plastic platters. Serge Kousse
vitzky conducts the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra in a brilliant inter
pretation of this great Strauss master
piece Bing Crosby, attempting
to follow up his successful string
of collaborations, has cut the first
of a series of sides with Eddie
"Begin the Beguine" Heywood and
his orchestra Jo Stafford will
record two albums under the Cap
itol banner come November
Rumor h>.s it that Mel Powell,
youthful ex-Goodman pianist, will
retire from the popular music field
to study the classics. Powell, re
cently returned from Europe, had
been playing with Glenn Miller's
service band.
Carmen Charniin'
The piano sty lings of Carmen
Cavallro, now entertaining cus
tomers nightly at the famed Mark
Hopkins Hotel in the city of
the Golden Gate. Fresh from a long
stint at Ciro's in Hollywood, Caval
laro with his amazing technique is
playing the same pleasing numbers
that have popularized his style
throughout the land. Although a
counterpart of his band may be dug
at any high school dance, C. C.
manages to make the evening very
enjoyable for all by rendering his
listenable scorings of "In Acapulco,"
"Baia," "Voodoo Moon," and of
course .Chopin's "Polonaise." The
Drag—Carmen's Boogie
Records on Review
Woody Herman's "Band of the
Year" comes up with another smash
Ralph Burns arrangement in "Bijou,"
an intricate orchestration of a
weird "Rhumba in Jazz." Kicking
it off with an unusually pleasing
riff, the Herman Herd goes in to a
somewhat over-scored background
to a Woody solo on alto. With Bill
Harris playing a too-sentimental
chorus on his blowsy trombone, the
band moves into a frantic last chor
us. The coupling is a novelty num
ber with vocal by Woodrow. Not
too impressive "Put That Ring on
My Finger," will undoubtably be
popular at the local jukebox. All
in all, it's a record worth your at
tention.
Feather Merchant, newest release
by Count Basie, bounces along in
the old Basie tradition. Featuring
the always welcome piano of the
Count himself, there is also a fine
chorus by trumpet Harry Edison and
another by sliphorn artist Dickie
Wells. The reverse, "Ain't It The
Truth," is another belter than av
erage Basie jump tune highlight
ing the same artists as on side one.
Leap Frog, Les Brown's latest of
fering is true to its title and jumps
throughout. Although slightly re
petitious at the outset, the record
progresses with superlative en
semble riffing, and fine Ted Nash
tenor sax. Following the trend of
other relaxed groups, "The Band of
Renown" is one of the nation's tops;
and this is a good example why.
On the reverse is Brown's newest
entry in the jukebox derby, a nov
elty arrangement of "Show Me the
Way to Go Home." Although fea
turing Butch Stone on the vocal,
this side fails to register due to a
mediocre scoring.
A Word (o the Wise

pleasure consisting of Duke Elling
ton and his Orchestra over KPO at
2 p.m., the Hank D'Amico Sextet

an intricate orchestration of a
weird "Rhumba in Jazz." Kicking
it off with an unusually pleasing
riff, the Herman Herd goes in to a
somewhat over-scored background
to a Woody solo on alto. With Bill
Harris playing a too-sentimental
chorus on his blowsy trombone, the
band moves into a frantic last chor
us. The coupling is a novelty num
ber with vocal by Woodrow. Not
too impressive "Put That Ring on
My Finger," will undoubtably be
popular at the local jukebox. All
in all, it's a record worth your at
tention.
Feather Merchant, newest release
by Count Basie, bounces along in
the old Basie tradition. Featuring
the always welcome piano of the
Count himself, there is also a fine
chorus by trumpet Harry Edison and
another by sliphorn artist Dickie
Wells. The reverse, "Ain't It The
Truth," is another belter than av
erage Basie jump tune highlight
ing the same artists as on side one.
Leap Frog, Les Brown's latest of
fering is true to its title and jumps
throughout. Although slightly re
petitious at the outset, the record
progresses with superlative en
semble riffing, and fine Ted Nash
tenor sax. Following the trend of
other relaxed groups, "The Band of
Renown" is one of the nation's tops;
and this is a good example why.
On the reverse is Brown's newest
entry in the jukebox derby, a nov
elty arrangement of "Show Me the
Way to Go Home." Although fea
turing Butch Stone on the vocal,
this side fails to register due to a
mediocre scoring.
