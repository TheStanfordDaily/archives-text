# 'Major in One Field,' Says Visiting Princeton Professor
## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
"Western universities are gener
ally more loosely organized than
Eastern ones," said Mr. Theodore M.
Greene, acting professor of humani
ties, in describing the academic as
well as the social aspects of the col
leges.
Here in the West colleges offer
many more courses and students
may choose them more freely, he
explained further.
Professor Greene, from Princeton,
is at Stanford for three quarters. At
the Eastern university he is a Mc-
Cosh professor of philosophy. He
is teaching an art interpretation
course and one in philosophy here
Lhis quarter.
Thesis and Exam
"At Princeton all students write
a senior thesis as well as take a
comprehensive examination at the
end of their junior and senior years.
A passing grade in these is neces
sary for graduation," he commented.
Professor Greene "suspects" that

Stanford is more enthusiastic about
sports than Princeton is, but hasn't
been here long enough to judge.
Socially, Princeton has clubs in
stead of fraternities. These are up
per class clubs, and men belong at
the end of their sophomore year.
They live in dormitories, but may
eat in their clubs, Professor Greene
said.
Speaking of the scholastic re
quirements of Stanford, he com
mented that here students are more
able to choose which courses they
want and are only hindered by a
few requirements and a sequence
of courses.
There are two sides to this ques
tion, he believes, for there is a tend
ency for the professor to have to
start at the beginning each quarter
because new students come in each
quarter. "In the East it is possible
to give more advanced courses in
Upper Division." he explained, "but
the good in students being able to
choose their courses balances the
loss."

However, liberal education is not
good unless a student masters one
field, Professor Greene said emphat
ically. "Major in one field and do
it well," is his advice to students.
A variety in other fields is desirable
too, he added.
In reviewing the background of
education in universities, he ex
plained that in the past all students
took the same courses and there was
no chance to branch out. With the
coming of the elective system there
has been a tendency to leave too few
requirements. "From table d'hote to j
cafeteria style" is the way he de
scribed it.
After a lÂ«ng discussion on the
subject of liberal deucation, Profes
sor Greene laughingly explained
that he had spent the last few years
speaking on the subject all over
the country. In addition he has ed
ited a book Entitled "Liberal Educa
tion Re-examined."
Professor Greene has a wide
background of travel behind him,
for he was born in Turkey of mis

sionary parents and lived there the
first 13 years of his life. He went
to college in Amherst, Mass., and
during the war went with the Y.M.-
C.A. to India, where he taught in
the Forman University in Punjab.
His graduate work was done in phi
losophy in Edinburgh, Scotland,
from where he went to Princeton
in 1933 and taught until this year.
International Courtship
Professor Greene's wife was born
in China; they met in Ohio, were
married in India, and spent their
honeymoon near the Taj-Mahal.
He is an enthusiastic amateur wa
ter colorist, with the emphasis on
the amateur, he laughed. "It's not
my major!" In addition to his art,
some examples of which hang on the
walls of his home, Professor Greene
has written a book, "Arts and the
Art of Criticism" (which weighs two
pounds, he said) and others on phi
losophy.
He and his daughter, Caroline
"Suzie" Greene, who is a student
here, live on Alvarado Street.
