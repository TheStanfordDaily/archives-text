Stanford's Food Research Insti
tute is the only one of its kind in
the world that deals with commodi
ty studies in international aspects.
According to Dr. Merrill Bennett,
executive director of the institute,
the department was founded at
Stanford in 1921 by the Carnegie
Corporation of New York and trus
tees of this university.
The founding of the research in
stitute was largely a result of un
fortunate experiences in the first
World War. At that time govern
ment officials who hud charge of
food problems were handicapped by
insufficient information about the
supply, consumption, and distribu
tion of food.
World Consumption Studied
These officials thought they could
remedy the situation in case of an
other war by founding a research
department to delve into the prob
lems of production, distribution, and
consumption throughout the world.
It was always the objective of the
founders to study food from a tech
nological and nutritive point of
view.
The original directors of this re
search department were chosen be
cause they represented different
types of specialized scientific train
ing. Dr. Alonso E. Taylor, who is
now with General Mills in Minne
sota, is an expert in human nu
trition. The late Dr. Carl L. Als
berg was a Bio-chemist and food
technician.
The third director, Dr. Joseph S.
Davis, who is still with the insti
tute, is a well known economist.
Dr. Bennett has been with the de
partment since 1922 and is a pro
fessor of economic Geography.
Institute at War
During this war, the staff of the
institute went into war activities,
but Dr. Bennett tried to hold the
department together since its work
is important in peace as well as hi
wartime.
