"The German Talks Back." By Heinrich Hauser. Henry Holt & Com
pany, 1945. $2.50.
Perhaps you don't care what "we are going to do with Germany." Per
haps you are sick and tired of weighty problems, which, you say, politic
ians mess up anyway. But whether you will die a natural death depends

largely on Allied policy toward the'
erstwhile huns.
Mr. Hauser, a Prussian and an
anti-Nazi, has some interesting ideas
on the subject. They are so inter
esting that as liberal a newspaper
as the Chicago Sun—usually the
first to defend freedom of speech—
has editorially objected to their pub
lication, and that the publishers read
them with anger and revulsion (so
they say).
Henry Holt & Co. maintain that
publication was motivated by their
desire to reveal a significant state
of mind.
This is somewhat strange, for
states of mind have generally been
the business of the psychiatrist and
not of John Q. Public. While the
psychiatrist can, to some extent,
analyze and understand neuroses
and complexes, the layman is usu
ally frightened, confused, or anger
ed by them.
Book Takes Concentration
This is not to accuse Mr. Hauser
of being neurotic, but to wonder
how many readers have sufficient
knowledge (and patience) to dissect
this work and benefit from it. The
author himself wonders too, affirm
ing repeatedly that we won't get
the drift of what he is talking about.
Many German writers, this one
among them, have the habit of ex
pressing their ideas in a very com
plicated manner. Mr. Hauser alter
nates between shock treatment—
"America is a tyranny,"—racial
doctrine—"The German felt that
after the old political frontier was
gone, they alone would not be able
to hold the racial frontier," —mys-

ticism, politically flavored—anguish
ed outcries—"where is the peace?
Not a qualified, not a conditional
substitute, but simply peace?—per
sonal anecdotes, improper and the
war criminal trials, and half truths
—"we always go to war in order to
have peace."
Add to this a mixture of pseudo
sociological, economic, philosophic
and emotional arguments. One is
led to ask whether writers resort
to these devices to display their
culture and variety of techniques o:-
to shroud in mist ideas they them
selves cannot consider clearly.
"Kehabilitation Spirit"
The reader is hit by the "spirit
of rehabilitation" on one page, by
the vices of Anglo-Saxonwoman
hood on the next. Germany, he is
told, is saying good-bye to western
civilization, but will remain linked
to the spirit of Prussia.
The German people, he reads, are
guilty, but must be allowed to pun
ish themselves.
By repetition Mr. Hauser makes
clear the ideas he wants to drive
home:
I. Germany is going Communist
because all other ideologies have
failed. This, apparently, is our fault:
at times the author believes that
the movement to the left is destined,
but then he informs us it will come
about if we don't learn quickly.
11. We cannot punish war crim
inals because we lack a common
base of moral values and because
the criminals don't feel guilty.
111. The old Prussian idea of

century cloisters alone can salvage
the teutonic race.
IV. We ought to leave the Ger
mans alone because we don't un
derstand them, because they don't
understand us, because they dislike,
and because we only make matters
worse by being th^re.
V. We have destroyed "the high
ideal of democracy" by letting it
fall into the hands of "that canaille
who make up the majority." Mr.
Haus?r has a right to criticize what
he considers our shortcomings.
Criticisms Not Logical
Some of his criticisms — over
mechanization and insufficient edu
cation, for instance—are justified.
But when he condemns America
and sings hymns of praise to the
Prussian eagle, the "logic of the
situation"—to speak in his language
—might lead him to ask why our
"empty shell" of democracy, our
"monstrous mechanism that works
not only to its own desecration but
to the detriment of all the world"
has been slightly more successful
than the Prussian junkers.
To search in the tangle of mystical,
geopolitical, personal, pseudo-his
torical, and hysteric statements is
a Herculean task and few of us are
equipped to do it. Yet indirectly
the book can be of service. Not by
giving us insight into a state of mind,
but by the opposite: by confusing
us.
Out of the confusion may come
the awareness that we lack the tools
for the job ahead and that unless
we apply the energy, ingenuity, and
hard work of war production
coupled with the intellectual hon
esty of scientific research to the task
of understanding nations with
whom we needs must live, our fu
ture is distinctly gloomy.
