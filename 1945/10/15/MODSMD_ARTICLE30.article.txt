# 'Rhapsody' Presents Gershwin at His Best
## 
### 
Either you are or you aren't. You
go nuts over Gershwin or reject
him entirely. That's the same way

with "Rhapsody
in Blue," Warner
Brothers adap
tion of the mu
sician's life. It's
the best picture
Hollywood has
turned out, or it's
one awful bore.
Gershwin's mu
sic is the picture.
The trumped up
story that Warn-

er's has given the picture is the
same kind of trash you can catch
any Saturday night at the Riallo,
but the musical numbers are per
haps the best that Hollywod has
produced in fifty years of trying.
Levant Shines
The Gershwin arrangements are
all excellent with Mr. Oscar Levant's
piano solos the best in musical sound
recording. A 1 Jolson's blackface
"Swunee," Hazel Scott's jazzy "The
Man I Love," sung in both French
and English, and Joan Leslie's
"Somebody Loves Me" are movie
making at its best.
The montage effects used during
Levant's "An American in Paris,"
are real artistry. They remind one
of the best interpretive scenes in
Disney's "Fantasia."
The camera follows, through the
eyes of a tourist, the traveler's first
hours in Paris. The camera work
is excellent and the Gershwin com
position synchonized perfectly.
Even the memorable Polonaise in
Columbia's "A Song to Remember"
pales in comparison to Levant's re
cordings of "Concerto in F," "Cuban
Overture," "Rhapsody in Blue"
(twice), and the excellent "An Am
erican in Paris."
Two Loves Too Many
Hollywood hasn't treated Gersh
win's life, though, with the same
respect that they've treated his mu
sic. They've credited two love af
fairs to Gershwin that apparently

never took place. They've given him
a lovable family that gets on your
lerves.
They have Gershwin in the plush
est of apartments that Warner's
property department could dream
up. But somehow out of this guff
they've managed to preserve enough
of Gei'shwin's energetic egotism to
prevent the whole dramatic side
of the picture from falling down
completely.
Robert Alda is adequate as Gersh
win but acting honors are stolen
by Herbert Rudley as brother Ira
and the beautous Alexis Smith as
Gershwin's second love. Albert
Basserman is sweet and sentimental
and terribly dull as Gershwin's
aged music teacher and Joan Leslie
is weak and insipid as the first of
George's women. Miss Leslie can
be thankful that she shows to good
enough advantage in the musical
numbers to offset the Thespian
angle.
Warner's had a hard job condens
ing all of Gershwin's music into a
two hour movie and have done well
under the circumstances. But we
wanted more of "Porgy and Bess"
and a little bit of "Strike Up the
Band," "Do Do Do," "Bidin* My
Time," to name a few.
For the most part, though, dis
cretion has been used in the cut
ting of the music, and no Gershwin
fan need be disappointed because
a favorite has been slighted.—Peck.

sic. They've credited two love af
fairs to Gershwin that apparently

never took place. They've given him
a lovable family that gets on your
lerves.
They have Gershwin in the plush
est of apartments that Warner's
property department could dream
up. But somehow out of this guff
they've managed to preserve enough
of Gei'shwin's energetic egotism to
prevent the whole dramatic side
of the picture from falling down
completely.
Robert Alda is adequate as Gersh
win but acting honors are stolen
by Herbert Rudley as brother Ira
and the beautous Alexis Smith as
Gershwin's second love. Albert
Basserman is sweet and sentimental
and terribly dull as Gershwin's
aged music teacher and Joan Leslie
is weak and insipid as the first of
George's women. Miss Leslie can
be thankful that she shows to good
enough advantage in the musical
numbers to offset the Thespian
angle.
Warner's had a hard job condens
ing all of Gershwin's music into a
two hour movie and have done well
under the circumstances. But we
wanted more of "Porgy and Bess"
and a little bit of "Strike Up the
Band," "Do Do Do," "Bidin* My
Time," to name a few.
For the most part, though, dis
cretion has been used in the cut
ting of the music, and no Gershwin
fan need be disappointed because
a favorite has been slighted.—Peck.

Either you are or you aren't. You
go nuts over Gershwin or reject
him entirely. That's the same way

with "Rhapsody
in Blue," Warner
Brothers adap
tion of the mu
sician's life. It's
the best picture
Hollywood has
turned out, or it's
one awful bore.
Gershwin's mu
sic is the picture.
The trumped up
story that Warn-

er's has given the picture is the
same kind of trash you can catch
any Saturday night at the Riallo,
but the musical numbers are per
haps the best that Hollywod has
produced in fifty years of trying.
Levant Shines
The Gershwin arrangements are
all excellent with Mr. Oscar Levant's
piano solos the best in musical sound
recording. A 1 Jolson's blackface
"Swunee," Hazel Scott's jazzy "The
Man I Love," sung in both French
and English, and Joan Leslie's
"Somebody Loves Me" are movie
making at its best.
The montage effects used during
Levant's "An American in Paris,"
are real artistry. They remind one
of the best interpretive scenes in
Disney's "Fantasia."
The camera follows, through the
eyes of a tourist, the traveler's first
hours in Paris. The camera work
is excellent and the Gershwin com
position synchonized perfectly.
Even the memorable Polonaise in
Columbia's "A Song to Remember"
pales in comparison to Levant's re
cordings of "Concerto in F," "Cuban
Overture," "Rhapsody in Blue"
(twice), and the excellent "An Am
erican in Paris."
Two Loves Too Many
Hollywood hasn't treated Gersh
win's life, though, with the same
