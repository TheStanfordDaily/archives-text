KETCHIKAN, Alaska, Oct. 14
(UP). â€”In a statement inspired by
criticisms from recent visiting Con
gressmen, Territorial Senator Nor
man K. Walker said today that Alas
ka needs capital but capital cannot
be blamed for being shy when it
knows it will be hampered by sti
fling bureaucracy and interfered
with by men who have had no bus
iness experience.
"There is nothing wrong with
Alaska that cannot be cured," the
senator added. He mentioned that
Alaskans are not primarily respon
sible for billions of board feet of
lumber going to waste and said that
Alaska's mining industry should be
placed on a strictly net income tax
and no gross tax basis.
