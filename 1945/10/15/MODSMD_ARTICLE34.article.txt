### ART LEVINSON 
First of all, the retraction and
correction department. The fresh
man football squad in '42 was men
tored by Francis (Willy) Wilcox,
and not as erronously stated, Willie
Maxwell. Why we should have
mixed up those two names is be
yound human imagination. Must
had had our mind on the 3rd race
at Jamaica. So apologies to Wil
cox for getting his name jumbled
up, and also apologies to Willie
Maxwell, if there should be such a
character, for misrepresenting him
as a football coach.
Has anyone been to the wrestl
ing matches lately? Aren't they
lousy? Foul memories of some
rasslin' matches seen last vaca
tion still lingers with this re
porter. Supporters of the sport
claim that if the matches weren't
"jobbed" up as they were, no
body would come. Scientific
wrestling is a drab affair, and the
ordinary fan doesn't get enthused
watching one contestant have a
hold on the other thai might last
for an hour.
We agree—but only that far.
Wrestling might be "liberalized" a
little to make the game exciting,
and throw a little color (besides

bruises and black eyes) into it. But
present day promoters are getting
carried away in their pink clouds.
A thing can be carried only so far.
When spitting, however delightful
the taste of the saliva, is injected,
and such fake stunts that even an
imbecile could detect are thrown
in the ring, we feel that even a
Bower-criticized flicker would be
more interesting.
A wrestler might "accidentally"
lose his hold once in awhile, or he
might even hurl oral invectives—
if they're not too nasty—at his op
ponent, and methinks that would be
on the level, but none of this hair
pulling faktiry. (It's too dandrufi'y.)
Boxing on the Upswing
Boxing is on the upsurge. Fisti
cuffers that have been grabbing
main eventers in big clubs — but
shouldn't have rated anything more
than the opener in the Watsonville
Junction or Alhambra arenas—are
disappearing from their wartime
fistania pinnacle. Nobody will miss
them, except maybe the yokel from
Alviso seeing his first professional
fight.
Tentative plans are being made
for the Billy Conn and Joe Louis
fracas next spring. Both boys are
out of the army, and plan to make
exhibition tours before they get
down to serious work for their
match. Mike Jacobs is entrepre
neur of the affair, as he is of all big
fights in the nation, and expects
to have tlje first post-war million
dollar gate for the fight
Watch (lay Paula at Ilollypark.
From one horseman to another,
the nag is good.
