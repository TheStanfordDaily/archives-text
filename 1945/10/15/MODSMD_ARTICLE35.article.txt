# 125 Men Out For 1st Drill
## 
### 
First drills on the field for foot
ball get under way today. About
125 men are expected to report, ac
cording head coach Marchie
Schwartz. Of this group, only about
eight men have had any collegiate
experience.
The Naval office has stated that
all N.R.O.T.C. rrien will be allowed
to participate in non-collegiate
games this year if their scholastic
averages are satisfactory. So if any
games are played, they will be
against service teams because of
naval reasons, and also because
there will be no loss of eligibility
for the civilian performers.
