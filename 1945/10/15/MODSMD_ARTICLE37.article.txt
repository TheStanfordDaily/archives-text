## Vow Boys Made Grid History at Stanford

(This is the first of a series of
articles tracing Stanford's loot
hall history from 1933 to the pres
ent. The purpose of these articles
is to acquaint Stanford students
with the traditions that have made
the Big Red grid machines so im
portant a part of campus life.—
Editor's note)
When they were nothing but a
group of callow sophomores, play
ing their first season of varsity com
petition, they solemnly vowed never
to lose to U.S.C. during their three
year careers—never to lose to the
powerful Trojan aggregation that
had whipped their school six years
in succession and had never tasted
defeat in 26 contests. They kept
their vow; because of it, they were
called the "Vow Boys," and as the
Vow Boys, they have become leg
endary in Stanford's football his
tory.
The year 19.'}.'] seems an appro-

priate time to begin our story of
Stanford football, because that
year marked the beginning of the
three-year reign of the Vow Boys
and the replacement of El Trojan
by Stanford as the dominant pow
er in Pacific Coast football. And
1933 also represents the advent of
a new head coach on the Farm—
Claude "Tiny" Thornhill, who
that year launched into the first
of his seven seasons as top man.
You'll probably want to remem
ber the names of some of those fa
mous Vow Boys—names like Monk
Moscrip, Keith Topping, Bob Rey
nolds, Bill Corbus, Frank "Owl
Eyes" Alustiza, Bones Hamilton,
Buck Van Dellen, and Bobby Gray
son. Some of them, like Corbus and
Van Dellen, did not play for the
whole three years of Vow Boy su

premacy, but all of them played a
large role in at least one of those
great seasons.
The 1933 season itself did not be
gin in a particularly auspicious
manner. The Indians nicked U.C.-
L.A. 3-0, and Santa Clara, 7-0, in
their first two games, but were held
to a scoreless tie by Northwestern,
and after squeezing by a weak San
Francisco eleven, 20-13, were hand
ed their first setback by Washing
ton, 6-0.
It was that historic U.S.C. battle
which started the 1933 team on
the road to glory. That day an
inspired Cardinal squad, recall
ing their famous vow, rose to un
precedented heights to slap down
the mighty men of Troy, 13-7. as
guard Corhus booted two field
goals to provide the margin of
victory.
Easy victories over Olympic Club,
21-0, and Montana, 33-7, were mere
ly warm-ups for the final game of
that great season, the 39th Big
Game with California. This Big
Game, however, was more than a
battle between two traditional ri
vals; it was a battle to determine
the Western representative in the
Rose Bowl classic.
Cal forged ahead in the second
period when Arleigh Williams boot
ed a 25-yard field goal, but their
triumph was short-lived. A pass
from Alustiza to end A 1 Norgard
gave Stanford a 7-3 win and the
Rose Bowl invitation.
January 1, 1934—and a heavily
favored Stanford varsity went down
to Rose Bowl defeat as Columbia's
under-rated squad sent A 1 Barabas
around end on a naked reverse for
the lone touchdown of the contest
and a 7-0 triumph.
