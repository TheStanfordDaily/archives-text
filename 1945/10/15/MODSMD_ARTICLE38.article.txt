# Bears Beaten; Trojans Upset

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14.—(UP).
—Only one major Pacific coast col
lege—little St. Mary's of Moraga—
tonight retained a perfect record as
upsets dashed the hopes of favored
clubs from Canada to Mexico yes
terday.
The Gaels, sparked by ail-Ameri
can Herman Wedemeyer, galloped
over under-manned College of Pa
cific, 61-0, to retain their unbeaten
and untied mark in four contests.
While St. Mary's remained at the
top of the far western ranks, Coach
Jeff Cravath's Trojans, riding the
crest of a 15-game winning streak,
were dumped by underdog San
Diego Navy, 33-6; University of
Washington spoiled Washington
State's perfect record, 6-0; and Ore
gon State Orangemen turned in an
uprising to down Oregon, 19-6.
Those were the major casualties
of a hard weekend on favorites
along the western coast. Only St.
Mary's survived the onslaught by
the underdogs. The Gaels now
have turned hack University of
California, Stockton Army Fliers,
University of Nevada and College
of Pacific on successive week
ends. Still on their schedule are
McClellan Field, USC, Fresno
State and UCLA.
The defeat of USC by the San
Diego Navy Club, while strictly a
surprise, failed to figure in the
Pacific Coast Conference standings
and the Trojans retain their place
at the top with two victories and
no losses.
UCLA moved up in the ratings
—and California down—as the
Bruins swamped Buck Shaw's
Bears by a 13-0 count. It was the
second loss in three tries for the
Golden Bear.
Nevada, slaughtered by St. Mary's
last week, came back to eke out a
19-14 win over the Santa Barbara
Marines, a previously unbeaten out
fit.
The upset of Oregon by OSC was
distinctly in the major category as
the webfeet had been figured on to
become one of the finest teams in
the conference. Only Jake Leicht
was able to keep the Orange team
from making a rout of it.
