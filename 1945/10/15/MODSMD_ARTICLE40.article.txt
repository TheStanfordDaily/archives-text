# AST Cagers Begin Play
## 
### 
One-sided scores continued to be
in evidence as the army's intra
mural basketball rolled into its sec
ond week of action. Last Thurs
day night marked the opening of
the third AST league, an ERC loop.
It appears more like a three game
total but anyhow the results turned
in had the powerful Shushies over
whelming—to put it very mildly—
the Zippers by a tune of 107-26.
When one considers that the boys
play only thirty minute games, 133
is a pile of points, in any man's
language, (including those G.l.'s
seeking discharge). Last week's
scoring leader was Polan, (of the
above mentioned outfit), with eleven
field goals for twenty two marks.
This week he just doubled
for a 44-point total.
Another far from close tilt fea
tured the strong Vita-Men finding
no difficulty in overturning the
tipsy B.F.'s, 45-12. A third "A"
l°ague contest was played between
the two types of hoboes, the "Bums"
and "Atom-Bums," with the simple
bums winning, 36-18.
"C" league leadership remained
substantially the same with the
"Coots" and "Lilywhiters" easily
bowling over their opposition. The
smooth working Coots subdued last
week's Cinderella outfit, the A.T.&Q.
Club, 29-11. Meanwhile the Giant
Five was feeling the efTects of a
28-19 lacing from the dainty boys.
The ASTEP got off to a belated
start due to the fact that their
term just began last week. The
closest fray of the season was be
tween two ERC outfits as the "Li'l
Papooses" staved off a last-half rally
of the "Corsairs" and eventually
come out on top, 24-23.
The other two ERC contests were
a direct antithesis. The Buzz-
Bombs bombed the Goof-OfTs into
submission, 31-9 and the Fighting
Ferries outfought the Diablo Devils
by a convincing margin, 39-10. A
fourth contest was schedule! be
tween the Tan of O and the Zig-
Zigs. Apparently the O's took off
on their tangent as they failed to
put in an appearance and conse
quently produced the only forfeit.

field goals for twenty two marks.
This week he just doubled
for a 44-point total.
Another far from close tilt fea
tured the strong Vita-Men finding
no difficulty in overturning the
tipsy B.F.'s, 45-12. A third "A"
l°ague contest was played between
the two types of hoboes, the "Bums"
and "Atom-Bums," with the simple
bums winning, 36-18.
"C" league leadership remained
substantially the same with the
"Coots" and "Lilywhiters" easily
bowling over their opposition. The
smooth working Coots subdued last
week's Cinderella outfit, the A.T.&Q.
Club, 29-11. Meanwhile the Giant
Five was feeling the efTects of a
28-19 lacing from the dainty boys.
The ASTEP got off to a belated
start due to the fact that their
term just began last week. The
closest fray of the season was be
tween two ERC outfits as the "Li'l
Papooses" staved off a last-half rally
of the "Corsairs" and eventually
come out on top, 24-23.
The other two ERC contests were
a direct antithesis. The Buzz-
Bombs bombed the Goof-OfTs into
submission, 31-9 and the Fighting
Ferries outfought the Diablo Devils
by a convincing margin, 39-10. A
fourth contest was schedule! be
tween the Tan of O and the Zig-
Zigs. Apparently the O's took off
on their tangent as they failed to
put in an appearance and conse
quently produced the only forfeit.
One-sided scores continued to be
in evidence as the army's intra
mural basketball rolled into its sec
ond week of action. Last Thurs
day night marked the opening of
the third AST league, an ERC loop.
It appears more like a three game
total but anyhow the results turned
in had the powerful Shushies over
whelming—to put it very mildly—
the Zippers by a tune of 107-26.
When one considers that the boys
play only thirty minute games, 133
is a pile of points, in any man's
language, (including those G.l.'s
seeking discharge). Last week's
scoring leader was Polan, (of the
above mentioned outfit), with eleven
field goals for twenty two marks.
This week he just doubled
for a 44-point total.
