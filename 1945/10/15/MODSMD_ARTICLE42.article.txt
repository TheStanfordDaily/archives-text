# Truman Ready to Consider New Wage Policy to Prevent Industrial Disputes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UP).—
President Truman prepared tonight
to tackle the critical problem of es
tablishing a wage policy that would
bring peace between management
and labor during the remaining
months of government economic
control.
Alarmed at the threat to recon
version posed by growing industrial
strife, lie was reported to be relying
upon a revamped War Labor Board
to formulate a transitional policy
that would head off hundreds of
strikes expected to result from la
bor's demands for higher basic wage
rates.
Garrison Considered
Mr. Truman was believed ready
to appoint Lloyd K. Garrison as
WLB chairman with instructions to
streamline procedure and handle
wage cases more speedily than dur
ing the war. Garrison is WLB vice
chairman and former dean of the

University of Wisconsin law school.
The President is expected to dis
cuss the wage problem at length
tomorrow with Secretary of Labor
Lewis B. Schwellenbach, who has
spent three weeks attempting with
out success to conciliate the oil and
coal disputes.
Schwellenbach accordingly has
postponed until 7 p.m. EST tomor
row the next negotiating conference
with the soft coal operators and
President John L. Lewis of the
United Mine Workers. The dispu
tants will begin their eighth day of
meetings with little progress appar
ent in efforts to end the strike of
200,000 miners which is costing the
nation more than 1,000,000 tons of
soft coal a day.
Senators Tense
In Congress, meanwhile, Senators
served notice that they may act
unless something is done soon. They

were cautious, however, about rec
ommending outright repeal of the
Smith-Connally Act, authority for
strike votes.
Sen. Owen Brewster, R., Me., said
he thought the President "is consid
ering doing something at what he
considers the proper time."
The coal dispute centers around
Lewis' demand that the operators
recognize UMW as bargaining agent
for soft coal supervisory employees.
Far-reaching as that issue is, Ad
ministration leaders are said to feel
they must move quickly on an
other front — growing unrest over
the issue of higher basic wage rates
to compensate for lower take-home
pay-

industry to proceed with reconver
sion production and submit their
wage disputes for WLB determina

cuss the wage problem at length
tomorrow with Secretary of Labor
Lewis B. Schwellenbach, who has
spent three weeks attempting with
out success to conciliate the oil and
coal disputes.
Schwellenbach accordingly has
postponed until 7 p.m. EST tomor
row the next negotiating conference
with the soft coal operators and
President John L. Lewis of the
United Mine Workers. The dispu
tants will begin their eighth day of
meetings with little progress appar
ent in efforts to end the strike of
200,000 miners which is costing the
nation more than 1,000,000 tons of
soft coal a day.
Senators Tense
In Congress, meanwhile, Senators
served notice that they may act
unless something is done soon. They

were cautious, however, about rec
ommending outright repeal of the
Smith-Connally Act, authority for
strike votes.
Sen. Owen Brewster, R., Me., said
he thought the President "is consid
ering doing something at what he
considers the proper time."
The coal dispute centers around
Lewis' demand that the operators
recognize UMW as bargaining agent
for soft coal supervisory employees.
Far-reaching as that issue is, Ad
ministration leaders are said to feel
they must move quickly on an
other front — growing unrest over
the issue of higher basic wage rates
to compensate for lower take-home
pay-
WLB. now under Schwellenbach's
jurisdiction, would ask labor and
industry to proceed with reconver
sion production and submit their
wage disputes for WLB determina
tion.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UP).—
President Truman prepared tonight
to tackle the critical problem of es
tablishing a wage policy that would
bring peace between management
and labor during the remaining
months of government economic
control.
Alarmed at the threat to recon
version posed by growing industrial
strife, lie was reported to be relying
upon a revamped War Labor Board
to formulate a transitional policy
that would head off hundreds of
strikes expected to result from la
bor's demands for higher basic wage
rates.
Garrison Considered
Mr. Truman was believed ready
to appoint Lloyd K. Garrison as
WLB chairman with instructions to
streamline procedure and handle
wage cases more speedily than dur
ing the war. Garrison is WLB vice
chairman and former dean of the

University of Wisconsin law school.
