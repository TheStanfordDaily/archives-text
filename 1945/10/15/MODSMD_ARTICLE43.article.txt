### 
TOKYO, Oct. 14 (UP). —Lt. Gen. Barney M. Giles today was appointed
commander of U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific and he said at a
press conference that he hoped "we will be in Japan for 100 years."
Giles, who succeeds Gen. Carl A. Spaatz, revealed that B-29 Super
fortresses would be based permanently in Japan at a still undisclosed site

•and that crews would be trained
here.
It was learned that Spaatz, who
directed the final phase of the air
offensive against Japan, and Gen.
George C. Kenney, air commander
under Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur,
who are now in Washington, would
be the chief spokesmen in a drive
for a separate air force during
forthcoming congressional hearings
on a Department of National De
fense.
\
Of the forthcoming battle for a
separate air force, Giles asked news
men to tell the American public
"the truth about the defeat of Japan
by strategic bombing."
"We want the taxpayer to get his
dollar's worth," Giles said. "Here
you can see what will give him the
most for his money. We want the
best team in the world. Not know
ing who or where the enemy will
be in the future, we need a bal
anced team."
Giles said that the B-29 was the
best possible plane at present for
dropping atomic bombs and"I don't
know any better one for the future."
He refused to state whether the
Americans had any atomic bombs
in Japan now.
(NBC Correspondent Guthrie
Janssen reported from Tokyo that
the crews on regular B-29 flights
over Japan were told not to bomb
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Nigata and
Yawata with ordinary bombs be
cause they were slated as atomic
targets.)
Giles will rpturn to Guam shortly
to set up his new headquarters. Ad
vance headquarters in Japan will
be headed by Brig. Gen. Norris B.
Harbold, former intelligence officer
of the USASTAF. Giles was chief
of the air staff in Washington during
the peak of the European war and
then became deputy to Spaatz in the
Pacific.
