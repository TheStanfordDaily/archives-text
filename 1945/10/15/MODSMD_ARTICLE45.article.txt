# Spain's Pretender 'Difficult-Franco
## 
### 
MADRID, Oct. .14 (UP).â€”Usually
well-informed sources, predicting a
hard road ahead for negotiations on
restoring the Spanish monarchy,
said today that Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco believes that Don Juan,
the Bourbon pretender, is being "in
tentionally difficult" in his dealings
to recover the throne.
Juan is in Switzerland. Well-in
formed sources said that because of
the attitude he has adopted, Franco
has decided to attempt to remain in
power by any means at his disposal.
Juan was represented as being
"difficult" in negotiations because
he foresees a possibility that he
might regain the throne, of which
his father was the last occupant,
without Franco's help.
Franco supporters claim that Juan
does hot want to come back to
Spain only to be ejected again when
the public mood changes, hence that
he is making the negotiations being
conducted through Jose Maria Oriol,
intermediary between Franco in
Spain and Don Juan in Switzerland,
as difficult as he can.
Monarchists assert on the other
hand that Juan is most anxious to
get home but that he wants popular
support before he starts his trip.
The Francoites insist that if Span
iards voted for the king's return,
they would tire of him quickly and
work to restore the republic.
