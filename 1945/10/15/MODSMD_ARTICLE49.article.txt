SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14 (UP).
— Already jam-packed with re
turned veterans and their families,
San Francisco braced itself tonight
for Monday's uproarious welcome to
Admiral William F. (Bull) Halsey
and the men of the returning tri
umphant Third Fleet.
While the city finished plans for
a rousing, two-day celebration hon
oring an estimated 45,000 service
men, crewmen of the Third Fleet,
liberated British and Norwegian
nationals, civic leaders and the
armed forces frantically sought
beds, beds and more beds.
Dairy companies forecast tonight
that San Francisco faces an acute
milk shortage because fialsey has
requisitioned supplies of the prod
uct, listed as one of the topmost
"wants" of the men who haven't
seen home shores for months and
in some cases years.
The 45,000 arrivals —an all-time
record for Golden Gate disembar
kations in a single day—included
some 38,000 men of the Third Fleet,
including 10,000 prospective dis
chargees, and more than 6,800 Army,
Navy, Marine and Seabee personnel
and wounded arriving on five trans
ports.
From units of the Third Fleet,
steaming toward the California
coast, came word that Adm. Hal
sey's flagship, the battleship South
Dakota, would lead a column of
ships under the Golden Gate Bridge
at noon tomorrow.
A flotilla of six submarines would
precede the fleet into the harbor.
Fifty newsmen, cameramen and
radiomen embarked on the destroy
er Samuel M. Moore at 3 p.m. (PST)
today to make a dawn rendezvous
with the South Dakota where the
newsmen will be transferred to the
giant ship by breeches buoy.
Fleet units to receive the whistle
tooting welcome and pass in review
before the South Dakota inside the
Gate were: the battleships Alabama,
Wisconsin and Colorado; the cruiser
Vicksburg; the destroyers De Ha
ven, Moore and the Blue; and the
submarines Puffer, Baya, Kraken,
Loggerhead, Pilot Fish and Stickle
back.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14 (UP).
— Already jam-packed with re
turned veterans and their families,
San Francisco braced itself tonight
for Monday's uproarious welcome to
Admiral William F. (Bull) Halsey
and the men of the returning tri
umphant Third Fleet.
While the city finished plans for
a rousing, two-day celebration hon
oring an estimated 45,000 service
men, crewmen of the Third Fleet,
liberated British and Norwegian
nationals, civic leaders and the
armed forces frantically sought
beds, beds and more beds.
Dairy companies forecast tonight
that San Francisco faces an acute
milk shortage because fialsey has
requisitioned supplies of the prod
uct, listed as one of the topmost
"wants" of the men who haven't
seen home shores for months and
in some cases years.
The 45,000 arrivals —an all-time
record for Golden Gate disembar
kations in a single day—included
some 38,000 men of the Third Fleet,
including 10,000 prospective dis
chargees, and more than 6,800 Army,
Navy, Marine and Seabee personnel
and wounded arriving on five trans
ports.
From units of the Third Fleet,
steaming toward the California
coast, came word that Adm. Hal
sey's flagship, the battleship South
Dakota, would lead a column of
ships under the Golden Gate Bridge
at noon tomorrow.
A flotilla of six submarines would
precede the fleet into the harbor.
Fifty newsmen, cameramen and
radiomen embarked on the destroy
er Samuel M. Moore at 3 p.m. (PST)
today to make a dawn rendezvous
with the South Dakota where the
newsmen will be transferred to the
giant ship by breeches buoy.
Fleet units to receive the whistle
tooting welcome and pass in review
before the South Dakota inside the
Gate were: the battleships Alabama,
Wisconsin and Colorado; the cruiser
Vicksburg; the destroyers De Ha
ven, Moore and the Blue; and the
submarines Puffer, Baya, Kraken,
Loggerhead, Pilot Fish and Stickle
back.
