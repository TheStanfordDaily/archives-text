### 
TOKYO, Oct. 14 (UP). — Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur will announce
shortly the areas of Japan to be as
signed to Russian, British and Chi
nese forces for occupation, it was
disclosed today, and announcement
that the Japanese army had been
completely demobilized was ex
pected tomorrow.
Col. H. B. Wheeler, spokesman
for Mac Arthur's chief of staff, Lt.
Gen. Richard K. Sutherland, said
he did not know whether the other
Allied nations were exerting pres
sure on the Americans to get their
occupation forces into Japan.
Occupation 'Too Smooth'
So far, he said, "the occupation is
running smoothly — almost too
smoothly." He indicated that the
first Chinese, Russian and British
forces would be of a token nature

and that Mac Arthur would assign
occupation areas to them when he
is informed of their size.
Mac Arthur, it was announced, will
broadcast over all American net
works at 8 a.m. Tuesday (6 p.m.
Monday EST), discussing the "mil
itary phases" of the occupation of
Japan. He will discuss the demo
bilization of the Japanese army,
scheduled to be completed by Mon
day, and will probably announce
the realization of that objective.
Meanwhile, it was disclosed that
the Japanese cabinet Monday would
hold its third extraordinary meet
ing in four days to discuss further
means of carrying out Mac Arthur's
five-point order of last Thursday
for political and social reforms.
Election Reforms
The cabinet complied with Mac-
Arthur's election reforms on Sat

urday, ratifying universal suffrage
and lowering of the voting age. It
still has to discuss encouragement
of the unionization of labor, more
liberal education, the abolishment
ojf secret inquisition, and democra
tizing Japanese economic institu
tions.
It was understood the cabinet also
was studying the question of allow
ing Japanese women to run for of
fice.
On the economic front, MacAthur
authorized the release of Japanese
petroleum stocks held by occupa
tion forces to essential Japanese in
dustries and consumers, providing
they were not otherwise being uti
lized. He also ordered the Japanese
to make monthly eports on how
fuel was being used—such as for
fishing boats, household purposes,
etc.—and of stocks on hand, and ex
pected rates of consumption.
