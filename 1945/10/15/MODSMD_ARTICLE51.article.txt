# Top Japanese Physicist Says Russia Has Atom Bomb Secret
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14 (UP). —One of Japan's foemost physicists
believes Russia probably already has perfected an atomic bomb as good
or better than those developed by the United States, Larry Tighe of the
American Broadcasting Company said today in a broadcast from Tokyo.
Prof. Bunsaku Arakatsu, head of the nuclear physics department at

the Imperial University at Kyoto. *
told Tighe that Japan could perfect
an atomic bomb of her own within
five to 10 years and that he al
ready had made tremendous strides
in that direction when U.S. military
forces cut off the electric power in
his laboratory.
Arakatsu Laughs
Arakatsu laughed when told the
United States did not intend to per
mit the secret to fall into other
hands, Tighe said, asserting any
country which could afford produc
tion costs could be manufacturing
atomic bombs very soon.
Tighe said he and Keith Wheeler
of the Chicago Times were shown
Arakatsu's laboratory and said they
were "shocked speechless" at the
progress Japan already had made.
Much of that progress had been
made, Arakatsu said, since the first
bomb was dropped at Hiroshima.
The information he gained from
studying the Hiroshima area cut his
own research by at least 40 years,
the Japanese scientist said.
Studies at Cambridge
"Arakatsu dumped the biggest
bombshell our way when he told of
his studies at Cambridge in Eng
land 18 years ago," Tighe said. "He
studied with a Professor Kapitza of
Russia who was working on nu
clear theories at that time.
"Since Professor Kapitza has be
come the foremost Russian scientist
in atom research and a few years
ago developed a method of lique
fying hydrogen and helium. . . .
"Arakatsu believes and managed
with almost no effort to convince us
that Russia at least is very close to
the core of the atomic bomb prob
lem.
"The biggest point, as far as I
was concerned, was his apparent
optimism—in fact surety—that Rus-

sia was on the ball in atom research
and probably already has something
like or better than ours."

or better than those developed by the United States, Larry Tighe of the
American Broadcasting Company said today in a broadcast from Tokyo.
Prof. Bunsaku Arakatsu, head of the nuclear physics department at

the Imperial University at Kyoto. *
told Tighe that Japan could perfect
an atomic bomb of her own within
five to 10 years and that he al
ready had made tremendous strides
in that direction when U.S. military
forces cut off the electric power in
his laboratory.
Arakatsu Laughs
Arakatsu laughed when told the
United States did not intend to per
mit the secret to fall into other
hands, Tighe said, asserting any
country which could afford produc
tion costs could be manufacturing
atomic bombs very soon.
Tighe said he and Keith Wheeler
of the Chicago Times were shown
Arakatsu's laboratory and said they
were "shocked speechless" at the
progress Japan already had made.
Much of that progress had been
made, Arakatsu said, since the first
bomb was dropped at Hiroshima.
The information he gained from
studying the Hiroshima area cut his
own research by at least 40 years,
the Japanese scientist said.
Studies at Cambridge
"Arakatsu dumped the biggest
bombshell our way when he told of
his studies at Cambridge in Eng
land 18 years ago," Tighe said. "He
studied with a Professor Kapitza of
Russia who was working on nu
clear theories at that time.
"Since Professor Kapitza has be
come the foremost Russian scientist
in atom research and a few years
ago developed a method of lique
fying hydrogen and helium. . . .
"Arakatsu believes and managed
with almost no effort to convince us
that Russia at least is very close to
the core of the atomic bomb prob
lem.
"The biggest point, as far as I
was concerned, was his apparent
optimism—in fact surety—that Rus-

sia was on the ball in atom research
and probably already has something
like or better than ours."
