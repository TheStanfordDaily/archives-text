# Rally Com Interviews for Tryoutees Continue Today
## 
### 
Stanford spirit is far from dead,
according to present members of
the reorganizing Rally Committee.
The response to the call for try
outees was so overwhelming on Fri
day that today's tryouts will be held
from 1 to 4 p.m. today instead of
at the previously announced time.
Students may try out for the com
mittee today and tomorrow in the
Excom room of Old Union. Tues
day's inteviews will be held from
1 to 3 p.m.
Enthusiasm Overwhelming
Everyone from frosh to juniors is
showing enthusiasm and interest in
Rally Com, according to chairmen
Patty Whittemore and Eugene Mit
guard and senior members Julie
Crommelin and Mary Jane Clat
worthy.
Twenty - five tryoutees were

turned away Friday afternoon be
cause of insufficient time for all try
outs.
Although the group trying out
Friday was "tremendous," Miss
Crommelin stresses the fact that
the committee wants many more
students to appear this afternoon
and tomorrow. No decisions as to
permanent Rally Com members
have been made yet.
The tryout consists of a private
interview given by the four senior
members of the committee. On
Tuesday, after the final interview,
this group will reduce the number
of candidates to 1(5, the figure de
cided on at a recent Cardinals meet
ing.
Final Decisions
That same night Cardinals will
vote on the list of names submitted
by Rally Com. Wednesday night, at

| the regular Excom meeting, the
j committee will be given a final
| cheek and go-ahead signal.
An additional group of six or
I eight freshmen will be chosen to
help the committee with its work.
If these alternate members prove
efficient, they will be promoted to
regular membership at the end of
their frosh year.
According to the A.S.S.U. con
stitution, appointments shall be
based on previous service to the
University; these appointees must
have a "C" average at the time of
taking office.
Willingness to Work
The chairmen of Rally Com are
J stressing the importance of enthu
j siasm and willingness to work as
! being qualities of future commit
' tee members and almost as impor
| tant as experience.

Marchie Schwartz has already an
nounced that the Farm football
team will play no conference games
this quarter, and probably very few
non-conference games. This means
that Rally Com will not start out
immediately with its glamorous pre
war activities. Most of its work this
year will be to build the commit
tee's organization up to its former
standard.
Basketball season, beginning late
in December, will give the new
Rally Com its first big chance to
take hold of all campus athletic
stunts. By the end of spring quar
ter, the committee chairmen hope
to hold another tryout period to en
large the group to its pre-war mem
bership total.
Enlarged Rally Com
In 1946 an enlarged Rally Com

| will direct Stanford rallies, stunls,
I and bonfires for an enlarged athletic
! program.
Chairman Eugene Mitguard re
minds the student body that it will
be this year's committee that will
build a foundation for the more ex
tensive activities planned for next
year.
Reorganizes of the committee are
hoping that Friday's enthusiasm will
be continued today and tomorrow.
They feel that with the backing of
Farm students Rally Com will once
again reach its former importance
in Stanford life.
Although the committee's work
this year will have little glory at
tached to it, members point out that
i students working on Rally Com
now will be doing a great service
for their school and friends.

that Rally Com will not start out
immediately with its glamorous pre
war activities. Most of its work this
year will be to build the commit

standard.
Basketball season, beginning late
in December, will give the new
Rally Com its first big chance to
take hold of all campus athletic
stunts. By the end of spring quar
ter, the committee chairmen hope
to hold another tryout period to en
large the group to its pre-war mem

Enlarged Rally Com
In 1946 an enlarged Rally Com

| will direct Stanford rallies, stunls,
I and bonfires for an enlarged athletic
! program.
Chairman Eugene Mitguard re
minds the student body that it will
be this year's committee that will
build a foundation for the more ex
tensive activities planned for next
year.
Reorganizes of the committee are
hoping that Friday's enthusiasm will
be continued today and tomorrow.
They feel that with the backing of
Farm students Rally Com will once
again reach its former importance
in Stanford life.
Although the committee's work
this year will have little glory at
tached to it, members point out that
i students working on Rally Com
now will be doing a great service
for their school and friends.
Stanford spirit is far from dead,
according to present members of
the reorganizing Rally Committee.
The response to the call for try
outees was so overwhelming on Fri
day that today's tryouts will be held
from 1 to 4 p.m. today instead of
at the previously announced time.
Students may try out for the com
mittee today and tomorrow in the
Excom room of Old Union. Tues
day's inteviews will be held from
1 to 3 p.m.
Enthusiasm Overwhelming
Everyone from frosh to juniors is
showing enthusiasm and interest in
Rally Com, according to chairmen
Patty Whittemore and Eugene Mit
guard and senior members Julie
Crommelin and Mary Jane Clat
worthy.
Twenty - five tryoutees were

turned away Friday afternoon be
cause of insufficient time for all try
outs.
Although the group trying out
Friday was "tremendous," Miss
Crommelin stresses the fact that
the committee wants many more
students to appear this afternoon
and tomorrow. No decisions as to
permanent Rally Com members
have been made yet.
The tryout consists of a private
interview given by the four senior
members of the committee. On
Tuesday, after the final interview,
this group will reduce the number
of candidates to 1(5, the figure de
cided on at a recent Cardinals meet
ing.
Final Decisions
That same night Cardinals will
vote on the list of names submitted
by Rally Com. Wednesday night, at

| the regular Excom meeting, the
j committee will be given a final
| cheek and go-ahead signal.
An additional group of six or
I eight freshmen will be chosen to
help the committee with its work.
If these alternate members prove
efficient, they will be promoted to
regular membership at the end of
their frosh year.
According to the A.S.S.U. con
stitution, appointments shall be
based on previous service to the
University; these appointees must
have a "C" average at the time of
taking office.

Marchie Schwartz has already an

team will play no conference games
this quarter, and probably very few

that Rally Com will not start out
