Stanford plays just a small part
in the national drive that is mobiliz
ing four million volunteers to carry
on the collection work in every com
munity of the nation.
Last year more than 40,000.000
Americans contributed to the War
Fund and its affiliated charities. The
money collected in the national
drive goes to every front in 125
major geographic areas on six conti
nents.
President Harry Truman has
said, in connection with the War
Fund, that '"all efforts /like it.
related to ending the war and
bringing peace, should go ahead
with full vigor."
It was in this spirit, that the Na
tional War Fund committee decided
to carry on the activities of the
drive after the end of the war with
Japan.
