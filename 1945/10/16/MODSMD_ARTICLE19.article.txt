## CIO Strike Halls Cargo Ships 
### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 15 (UP). â€”Fourteen ships, fully loaded with Army
cargoes for Japan, Okinawa and (he Marianas, remained tied up in
Seattle, Tacoina and Everett, Wash., today due to continued refusal of
Marine Cooks' and Stewards' Association (CIO) members to sign aboard.
The deadlock resulted when the War Shipping Administration re
duced the size of ship's stewards departments after gun crews were
rcduced following Japan's surrender. The reduction in the number of
stewards, however, was churned by the union to he greater than pre
war levels.
