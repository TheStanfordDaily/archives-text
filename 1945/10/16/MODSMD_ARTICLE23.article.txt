## TOO MUCH TEA 
### 
Having a distinct antipathy to the words
"social program"—they bring visions of prim
little girls, wearing Quad clothes (of course),
visiting upper division residences, balancing
led cups, and playing "do you know so-and
so?" we were pleased to read last week of
"W.A.A. plans for a field day to help new
wotm.n students "become better acquainted
with each other, with Stanford, and with the
W.A.A."
This is the way to do it, we thought; this
is the way to help every freshman woman feel
herself part of a "congenial group"; this is an
excellent method of promoting that much
talkod of spirit of friendliness and co-operation
thf'.t is going to unify ail women in the Happy
Housing Program. Besides, we thought, Stan
ford women will go much farther toward get
iing acquainted by running an obstacle race
than by attending a tea party. Why, a lot of
people at Stanford have become best friends
alter batting each other across the shins play
ing ice hockey.
Carrie the day of the big event (last Friday)
and upper division women were ready to show
.sports movies, run races, serve refreshments,
stage a djr/ing exhibition for over 200 Roble
women, off campus freshmen, and transfers.
Out of that number approximately 50 arrived.
The facts confuse us. We don't quite under
stand. Maybe freshman women would rather
don formals, shake hands in a receiving line,
balance a tea cup, engage in "small talk,"
thinking they can "become acquainted." Sorry,
we can't see it that way.
