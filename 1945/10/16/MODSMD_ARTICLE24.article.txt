### Stanley Wilson 
FIRST OF THE WEEK PRATTLE
Now that the war has terminated we might
be prone to neglect many of our national and
world-wide responsibilities. One of those ob
ligations has come before us this week—the
National War Fund drive. Even though hostil
ities have ceased, there still are neglected and
impoverished people all over the world. A
small part of Stanford's quota—s6,ooo—will go
to outside charity work, but the majority of it
will be submitted to local agencies. Help the
neglected here as well as abroad. The quota
for each Stanford student is $4.00. You take it
from here; it's your show.

II you v/ant two and a half hours of sheer
musical enjoyment, don't fail to see "Rhapsody
in Blue," currently showing at the Stanford.
The story of George Gershwin's life, "Rhap
sody in Blue," is of technicolor calibre, but
slill achieves tremendous effect through the
medium of black and white. It is the story of
a musical man in a musical world, that's all.
Any words of praise would seem inadequate.
See it and you'll know what I mean.
An elderly gentleman gave me a ride into
Paly the other day and gave me some infor
mation which I will pass on to you for what
it is worth. I don't know the gentleman's
name or I would give credit where it is due.
The usual patter took place at the outset —
Iho weather, a resume of my course, etc. By
the time we were half way down Palm Drive
v/n were discussing the afternoon's Carillon
concert. My newly acquired friend declared
Ihe best listening post for the Belgium Bells
was in the middle of Inner Quad. It is the
proper distance and no echo is produced. Take
it for what it is worth. He seemed to know
what he was talking about. .
Tor you ex-servicemen, and others interested
in the returning fighting man, read Bill Maul
din's humorous story of his experiences in last
week's Colliers. Mauldin achieved fame in
this country during the war drawing cartoons
of the infantryman up front. In the Colliers
yarn, Mauldin projects his humor to the writ
ten word. * * *
For you people who anxiously are waiting the
release of the 1945 Quad, don't feel bad. Ac
cording to the Daily Trojan, USC's sheet, their
yearbook just hit the stands last week. Have
patience, have patience.

And now the Japanese are fighting with
the Annamites, and also are lending a few men
to the Allied fighting forces. I wish somebody
would decide once and for ail who somebody
is fighting and stick to it. This is confusing!
