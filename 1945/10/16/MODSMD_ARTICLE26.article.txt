### Elliot Epsteen 
The war continues, but now it has become
something out of Rudyard Kipling translated
in terms of tanks and flamethrowers. And,
now, the Japs are on our side.
The puppet governments which Japan set up
in Indo China and the Dutch East Indies don't
like the idea of falling along with their former
source of succor, so, when Allied troops moved
in to relieve them of command, they started
screaming "White Imperialism."
The forces that Britain, France, Holland and
even America are fighting are fairly well
armed. They took over Jap tanks, roadblocks,
explosives, rifles and machine guns. However,
in Indo China they have been checked at Sai
gon, and are having a tough time of it in
Sumatra.
In Java, the so-called "people's army" de
clared a no-quarter, no-holds-barred war on all
Whites and Eurasians, and started a march on
Batavia. So far, they have ravaged the hinter
land, but the British main body is posted near
the city, ready for a major battle. It probably
won't last long, since the British have a con
centrated target to strike at in the open and
with superior firepower. In commenting on the
developing campaign, it seems that the Indo
nesians are making the same mistake that the
Ethiopians made when fighting the Italians.
JAPS
The Japanese army—the largest military
force in the area—is fighting on our side in
line with British directives to help maintain
order. This is reminiscent of the climax of the
Spanish-American war, when we reguested the
Spanish army to stay in Manila until we could
relieve it and drive out the "insurgentes."
But above all this comes the guestion, what
should our policy be in these areas? It will
have to develop because the fighting might
even spread to India.
First of all, in the present instance, we find
that the governments we are fighting supported
those fountainhears of liberalism, lapanese
garrison commanders. Thus, in a few years,
the Indonesians and Indo-Chinese might be
wishing for the dear old days when they were
under the Europeans.
Secondly, the declaration of war on "all
Whites and Eurasians" shows that the insur
gents don't want to rise to a position of racial
eguality, but demand the license to impose one
of racial persecution, with some of the former
top-dogs and all of the lowest bottom-dogs on
the bottom.
Thus, we would not be wrong morally in
supporting our European allies.
OVERALL POLICY
But secondly comes the question of overall
policy. If we were to free Indonesia and Indo
China, and not to arm China, we would find
Asia becoming a political vacuum to be split
up by Russia and a Japanese renaissance.
If, however, we were to free these countries
and also rearm China, the local Annamite, In
donesian, and Indian politicos would start get
ting the bright idea that they needed a strong
Asiatic power as an ally to maintain their own
authorities, so we might find our reward being
a billion Asiatics glaring at us over gunsights
which we provided them.
For these reasons, it is wiser for us to main
tain the control of Europe in such strategic
positions as Indo China, the East Indies, and
India, because we will always have Allies in
the Pacific, and will not have to worry about
that fear of everybody since Spengler—a great
racial Armadegeddon.

that the governments we are fighting supported
those fountainhears of liberalism, lapanese
garrison commanders. Thus, in a few years,
the Indonesians and Indo-Chinese might be
wishing for the dear old days when they were
under the Europeans.
Secondly, the declaration of war on "all
Whites and Eurasians" shows that the insur
gents don't want to rise to a position of racial
eguality, but demand the license to impose one
of racial persecution, with some of the former
top-dogs and all of the lowest bottom-dogs on
the bottom.
Thus, we would not be wrong morally in
supporting our European allies.
OVERALL POLICY
But secondly comes the question of overall
policy. If we were to free Indonesia and Indo
China, and not to arm China, we would find
Asia becoming a political vacuum to be split
up by Russia and a Japanese renaissance.
If, however, we were to free these countries
and also rearm China, the local Annamite, In
donesian, and Indian politicos would start get
ting the bright idea that they needed a strong
Asiatic power as an ally to maintain their own
authorities, so we might find our reward being
a billion Asiatics glaring at us over gunsights
which we provided them.
For these reasons, it is wiser for us to main
tain the control of Europe in such strategic
positions as Indo China, the East Indies, and
India, because we will always have Allies in
the Pacific, and will not have to worry about
that fear of everybody since Spengler—a great
racial Armadegeddon.
The war continues, but now it has become
something out of Rudyard Kipling translated
in terms of tanks and flamethrowers. And,
now, the Japs are on our side.
The puppet governments which Japan set up
in Indo China and the Dutch East Indies don't
like the idea of falling along with their former
source of succor, so, when Allied troops moved
in to relieve them of command, they started
screaming "White Imperialism."
The forces that Britain, France, Holland and
even America are fighting are fairly well
armed. They took over Jap tanks, roadblocks,
explosives, rifles and machine guns. However,
in Indo China they have been checked at Sai
gon, and are having a tough time of it in
Sumatra.
In Java, the so-called "people's army" de
clared a no-quarter, no-holds-barred war on all
Whites and Eurasians, and started a march on
Batavia. So far, they have ravaged the hinter
land, but the British main body is posted near
the city, ready for a major battle. It probably
won't last long, since the British have a con
centrated target to strike at in the open and
with superior firepower. In commenting on the
developing campaign, it seems that the Indo
nesians are making the same mistake that the
Ethiopians made when fighting the Italians.
JAPS
The Japanese army—the largest military
force in the area—is fighting on our side in
line with British directives to help maintain
order. This is reminiscent of the climax of the
Spanish-American war, when we reguested the
Spanish army to stay in Manila until we could
relieve it and drive out the "insurgentes."
But above all this comes the guestion, what
should our policy be in these areas? It will
have to develop because the fighting might
even spread to India.
First of all, in the present instance, we find
that the governments we are fighting supported
those fountainhears of liberalism, lapanese
garrison commanders. Thus, in a few years,
the Indonesians and Indo-Chinese might be
