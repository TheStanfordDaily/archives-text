STANFORD SPIRIT
To The Editor:
The words "Stanford spirit" have been re
peated countless times in recent days, from the
lips of speakers, in the columns of The Daily,
in the casual conversation of Quad-walkers.
Why is it that so many refer to it as a sort of
"Holy Grail" which we have been and are
seeking through the adversity of war and re
conversion? Are we seeking the same spirit
that existed before? How can we? We are not
identical with the students of other years. The
personality of the "spirit" should therefore
change with time and the aggregate of the
student body. Is it as immutable as the speed
of light? (As a suggestion let's think of ij
rather as a phoenix rising from its own ashes,
forever being created anew). Into each rein
carnation of the "spirit" go all the constituents
of former "spirits," but it has a distinct charac
ter peculiar to itself.
All these words are meant to raise no issue,
but merely to suggest that we stop speaking of
the Stanford spirit as something for which we
are "feeling but can't guite reach." It's not
our job to recapture the spirit of former years,
but to establish our ownâ€”a dynamic and in
dividualistic expression, compounded from the
life and breath of our days at Stanford.
