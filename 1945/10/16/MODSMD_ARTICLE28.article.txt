# Student Government Is Still Financially Dependent on University Supervision
## General Manager, Student Manager Control ASSU Fees In Accordance With University Financial Regulations 
### 
(This is the last in a series of
articles concerning functions of
student government, especially in
their position under the new con
stitution in trial-use. The new
possibility of independent or
ganizations and the A.S.S.U.'s
financial setup are discussed.)
The financial string is the only
one by which student government
at Stanford is tied to university su
pervision. A $12,000 collection of
student body fees paid with tuition
on Reg day is supervised by a Gen
eral Manager, Al Masters, through
a graduate student, known as the
Student Manager, currently B. J.
Calfee.
This student manager has the
power to control the finances and
credit ol student organizations in
accordance with certain financial
rules. All treasurers and business
managers of student organizations
follow the rules of financial pro
cedure laid down by the office.
Of the $15 student body fee col
lected from each student, 75c goes
to the Stanford Daily, whose total
budget, averaging over $8,000 a
quarter, including its advertising
revenue, is the largest financial
project.
Another .50 goes to the Women's
Athletic Assn., for its intramural
and other activities. The remainder
plus individual assessments, is the
general A.S.S.U. account called the
Students' Organization Fund and
special campus groups as well as
Cardinals, War Board and living
groups are granted funds from it.
When the men's Athletic Association
is functioning $1 from each man's
student body fee goes to that or
ganization.
A good test of student govern
ment has been the degree to which
finances of organizations could be
handled efficiently without the ne
cessity of many rules imposed by
the General Manager to protect the
funds. In this respect it is interest
ing to note that student govern
ment has not established a very good
record financially and many exact
ing and hampering rules exist as a
burden to administration, necessi
tated by previous mishandling of
funds.
All organizations have heretofore
been subsidiaries of the A.S.S.U.
with its funds under supervision of
the General Manager. Under the
new constitution however it is pos
sible for independent organizations
to exist bearing the name of the
student body.
This innovation opens the way
for a student organization such as
a magazine to whom independence
in all respects would be valuable, to
exist independent of general finan
cial rules required of a more static
enterprise.

tated by previous mishandling of
funds.
All organizations have heretofore
been subsidiaries of the A.S.S.U.
with its funds under supervision of
the General Manager. Under the
new constitution however it is pos
sible for independent organizations
to exist bearing the name of the
student body.
This innovation opens the way
for a student organization such as
a magazine to whom independence
in all respects would be valuable, to
exist independent of general finan
cial rules required of a more static
enterprise.
(This is the last in a series of
articles concerning functions of
student government, especially in
their position under the new con
stitution in trial-use. The new
possibility of independent or
ganizations and the A.S.S.U.'s
financial setup are discussed.)
The financial string is the only
one by which student government
at Stanford is tied to university su
pervision. A $12,000 collection of
student body fees paid with tuition
on Reg day is supervised by a Gen
eral Manager, Al Masters, through
a graduate student, known as the
Student Manager, currently B. J.
Calfee.
This student manager has the
power to control the finances and
credit ol student organizations in
accordance with certain financial
rules. All treasurers and business
managers of student organizations
follow the rules of financial pro
cedure laid down by the office.
Of the $15 student body fee col
lected from each student, 75c goes
to the Stanford Daily, whose total
budget, averaging over $8,000 a
quarter, including its advertising
revenue, is the largest financial
project.
Another .50 goes to the Women's
Athletic Assn., for its intramural
and other activities. The remainder
plus individual assessments, is the
general A.S.S.U. account called the
Students' Organization Fund and
special campus groups as well as
Cardinals, War Board and living
groups are granted funds from it.
When the men's Athletic Association
is functioning $1 from each man's
student body fee goes to that or
ganization.
A good test of student govern
ment has been the degree to which
finances of organizations could be
handled efficiently without the ne
cessity of many rules imposed by
the General Manager to protect the
funds. In this respect it is interest
ing to note that student govern
ment has not established a very good
record financially and many exact
ing and hampering rules exist as a
burden to administration, necessi
tated by previous mishandling of
funds.
