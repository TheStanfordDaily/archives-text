# Ezio Pinza Impressive In 'Boris'
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
Although Mussorgsky's "Boris
Godounoff" got off to somewhat of a
slow start in its Friday night per
formance at the San Francisco Me
morial Opera House, the cast soon
warmed up and turned in a more
than creditable performance of this
difficult opera.
Boris Godounoff usurped the Rus
sian throne at one period in Rus
sian history, and the opera deals
mainly with his downfall and death.
This is done primarily through crowd
scenes reflecting the effect of Boris'
rule on the people.
Ezio Pinza sang the role of Boris,
and although he only has two main
scenes to himself, he turned in a
much better characterization than
this reviewer expected. The famous
"clock" scene, in which Boris sees
a vision of the murdered heir to the
throne and is overcome with re
morse for his crimes, was a little
hammy. Pinza played a little too
much to the audience to be entirely
convincing. His acting in the "death"
scene was beautifully done, how
ever, and had the audience con
vinced that this was Boris and not
just Pinza playing Boris.
His singing, except in the first
scene, was excellent all the way
through and coordinated perfectly
v/ith his powerful dramatization of
the part, particularly in his last
.scene. One defect of the whole per
formance was that it was sung in
Italian, thereby losing some of the
powerful emotional impact that ac
companies a performance in the or
iginal Russian.
Top credit, however, must go to
tht chorus, and the beautiful way
the crowd scenes were handled.
Crowds in any opera are difficult,
but the large mass movement of
people on the stage in "Boris" was
accomplished without any effect of
awkwardness or unpreparedness.
Particularly good in this line were
the famous coronation scene and the
scene on the wintry Russian steppes
where the crowd plans to over
throw Boris.
In supporting roles, top honors
go to Salvatore Baccaloni as Var
laam, the comic buffoon who acts as
side kick for the false Dimitri in
his escape from the convent. Much

credit should be given also to Fred
erick Jagel as Dimitri the monk,
who plans the overthrow of Boris;
and his lady-love Marina, sung by
Vivian Delia Chiesa. Also worthy
of mention in a small, but well
sung, role was Lorenzo Alvary as
Brother Pimenn.
The orchestra, under the direction
of George Sebastian, was more than
adequate and worked well with the
singers.
Altogether "Boris Godounoff"
proved to be a smooth and polished
production, and as good a one as
American opera can hope to see
at the present time.

singers.
Altogether "Boris Godounoff"
proved to be a smooth and polished
production, and as good a one as
American opera can hope to see
at the present time.
Although Mussorgsky's "Boris
Godounoff" got off to somewhat of a
slow start in its Friday night per
formance at the San Francisco Me
morial Opera House, the cast soon
warmed up and turned in a more
than creditable performance of this
difficult opera.
Boris Godounoff usurped the Rus
sian throne at one period in Rus
sian history, and the opera deals
mainly with his downfall and death.
This is done primarily through crowd
scenes reflecting the effect of Boris'
rule on the people.
Ezio Pinza sang the role of Boris,
and although he only has two main
scenes to himself, he turned in a
much better characterization than
this reviewer expected. The famous
"clock" scene, in which Boris sees
a vision of the murdered heir to the
throne and is overcome with re
morse for his crimes, was a little
hammy. Pinza played a little too
much to the audience to be entirely
convincing. His acting in the "death"
scene was beautifully done, how
ever, and had the audience con
vinced that this was Boris and not
just Pinza playing Boris.
His singing, except in the first
scene, was excellent all the way
through and coordinated perfectly
v/ith his powerful dramatization of
the part, particularly in his last
.scene. One defect of the whole per
formance was that it was sung in
Italian, thereby losing some of the
powerful emotional impact that ac
companies a performance in the or
iginal Russian.
Top credit, however, must go to
tht chorus, and the beautiful way
the crowd scenes were handled.
Crowds in any opera are difficult,
but the large mass movement of
people on the stage in "Boris" was
accomplished without any effect of
awkwardness or unpreparedness.
Particularly good in this line were
the famous coronation scene and the
scene on the wintry Russian steppes
where the crowd plans to over
throw Boris.
In supporting roles, top honors
go to Salvatore Baccaloni as Var
laam, the comic buffoon who acts as
side kick for the false Dimitri in
his escape from the convent. Much

credit should be given also to Fred
erick Jagel as Dimitri the monk,
who plans the overthrow of Boris;
and his lady-love Marina, sung by
Vivian Delia Chiesa. Also worthy
of mention in a small, but well
sung, role was Lorenzo Alvary as
Brother Pimenn.
The orchestra, under the direction
of George Sebastian, was more than
adequate and worked well with the
singers.
