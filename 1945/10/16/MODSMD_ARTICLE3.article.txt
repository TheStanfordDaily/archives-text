PEARL HARBOR, Oct. 15 (UP).
â€”Depth charges exploded on ca
reening decks while sailors were
swallowed up in huge whirlpools
and some ships were rammed a
dozen times during the typhoon
which swept Okinawa last week,
reports reahing here revealed today.
The U.S.S. Southern Seas, for
mer $2,000,000 yacht owned by
Cyrus Curtis, publisher of the
Saturday Evening Post, was hit
by a dozen ships until she broke
up and sank in the mountainous
seas.
The 10,000 - ton U.S.S. Ocelot,
whose bottom was torn out when
she was rammed five times, finally
was struck by the minesweeper YP
-289 and blown in half by a depth
charge.
The YP-28!). the former tuna
clipper McParamount, from San
Diego, lost its stern in the explo
sion and was cut in two by a third
ship.
There were no fatalities aboard
the Ocelot and only one seriously
injured aboard the minesweeper.
Names of casualties were unavail
able.
These ships were typical of
the havoc caused by winds that
reached more than 170 miles an
hour across Buckncr Bay anchor
age, Navy reports said.
Ens. Bernard J. Cohen, Brooklyn,
one of the surviving officers of the
Southern Seas, said the former
yacht snapped its mooring cable and
her captain, Lt. Charles McMichael,
Alexandria, Ga., was unable to con
trol her.
A large merchant ship rammed
the yacht broadside, Cohen re
lated, crumbling the Southern
Seas' boat deck and bridge.
The huge propellers of the mer
chantman chewed deep gashes in
the small yacht, Cohen said, and
the small ship careened out of con
trol.
"We transferred men to other
ships, slamming into nearby ves
sels all the while," Cohen said.
