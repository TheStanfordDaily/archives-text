# Laval Meets Indignant End
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 15 (UP).â€”Pierre La
val, shouting ''Vive la France," died
before a firing squad today, four
hours after he botched an attempt
to cheat justice by taking a dose of
poison too weak to permit him to
die by his own hand.
The swarthy, 62-year-old politi
cian who sold out France to Adolf
Hitler after serving as his country's
premier three times, met a traitor's
end at 12:32 p.m. in the grim court
yard of Fresnes prison. The bullets
from a 12-man firing squad ripped
into his sagging body strapped to
the execution stake.
Laval, who had cheated and be
trayed millions of his countrymen
during the four-year shame of the
Vichy regime, cheated himself at
the end. He had hidden on his per
son before he fled to Germany last
August a vial of potassium cyanide,
Laval said. He managed to keep it
secreted throughout his flight to
Spain and his trial in Paris, but time
had weakened the poison.
