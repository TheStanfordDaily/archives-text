### 
A few teams in each of the intra
mural football league have already
shown that they'll be tough to beat
as the season progresses. Al'tfr to
day's games the picture will prob
ably be clear enough to show the
probable champs and runners-up.
Mr. Bugge asks that all officials
of this afternoon's clashes meet in
the proctor's office in the gym at
4:15 p.m.
