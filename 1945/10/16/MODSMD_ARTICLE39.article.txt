When Chang, the half-lama in
Hilton's book "Lost Horizon," was
showing Robert Conway and his
friends around Shangri-La, he ut
tered a prize statement —one that
was in reality not so far from
wrong. "Our people," he said,
"would never dream of participat
ing in the games of mimic warfare
that you outsiders practice on your
playgrounds and athletic fields." It
has always been a source of wonder
to me when I think of this quip,
whether or not Chang was not
right.
Football is in a sense nothing more
than "mimic warfare." When it
goes into the professional stage, the
game is reduced to just that. Play
ers play hard—for money —and the
only compensation for a broken
ankle, torn ligaments, or a sprain is
being sidelined for a few weeks,
whfch in professional standards is
nothing more than costful inactiv
ity. Pros are being paid to play, not
to sit on the bench.
However, Chang perhaps did
not understand that behind all our
rough and tumble sports antics
there lies the spirit of competition,
something which he and his dis
ciples frowned upon. Baseball
players have often been benched
because they took their game
more as a business than a great
national pastime. Ask any base
ball coach, and he'll tell you that
bustle and drive are two of the
essentials that go to make up a
good ball player. (Sounds like an
advertisement for breakfast food.)
Teamwork Vital
Chang was not aware that team
work, which is another "must" in
most competitive sports, is another
important lesson learned by those
who partake in athletics—the same
teamwork so vital in industry and,
yes, even in warfare.
Individual stars are nothng more
than drawing cards; it's the team
behind that one man that is in part
responsible for his exploits. A bas
ketball star won't make any coun
ters at all unless there is someone
there to pass him the ball. Don
Hutson is one of the greatest ends
in gridiron history, but someone
had to throw the passes to him.
Our own basketball mentor Ev
erett Dean was a participant in
one of the best things tlie Army
has ever done for its men. a sports
rehabilitation program that ex
tended an opportunity for all Gl's
to take part in sports. There have
been many suggestions that a pro
gram of this type be started for
youths all over the United States
—not a bad idea when you con
sider the low average in physical
condition of prospective draftees
at the beginning of the war.
Many big league baseball clubs
have started programs wherein they
will establish class D leagues to
give up-and-coming ball players a
real chance to develop their talent.
As far as colleges go, the curricu
lum cannot possibly be considered
complete unless athletics play a
major part. Too many students let
the process of developing their in
tellects push aside the process of
developing their bodies. It takes
brains to be a good football, basket
ball, or baseball player. Byron
"Whizzer" White, former All-Amer
ican football back from the Univer
sity of Colorado, was offered a
Rhodes scholarship; "Buddy" Young,
Negro halfback from Illinois, was a
straight "A" student.
The ancient Greeks considered
the development of the body as
important as the development of
the mind. What was good then
is as good or better now.

nothing more than costful inactiv
ity. Pros are being paid to play, not
to sit on the bench.
However, Chang perhaps did
not understand that behind all our
rough and tumble sports antics
there lies the spirit of competition,
something which he and his dis
ciples frowned upon. Baseball
players have often been benched
because they took their game
more as a business than a great
national pastime. Ask any base
ball coach, and he'll tell you that
bustle and drive are two of the
essentials that go to make up a
good ball player. (Sounds like an
advertisement for breakfast food.)
Teamwork Vital
Chang was not aware that team
work, which is another "must" in
most competitive sports, is another
important lesson learned by those
who partake in athletics—the same
teamwork so vital in industry and,
yes, even in warfare.
Individual stars are nothng more
than drawing cards; it's the team
behind that one man that is in part
responsible for his exploits. A bas
ketball star won't make any coun
ters at all unless there is someone
there to pass him the ball. Don
Hutson is one of the greatest ends
in gridiron history, but someone
had to throw the passes to him.
Our own basketball mentor Ev
erett Dean was a participant in
one of the best things tlie Army
has ever done for its men. a sports
rehabilitation program that ex
tended an opportunity for all Gl's
to take part in sports. There have
been many suggestions that a pro
gram of this type be started for
youths all over the United States
—not a bad idea when you con
sider the low average in physical
condition of prospective draftees
at the beginning of the war.
Many big league baseball clubs
have started programs wherein they
will establish class D leagues to
give up-and-coming ball players a
real chance to develop their talent.
As far as colleges go, the curricu
lum cannot possibly be considered
complete unless athletics play a
major part. Too many students let
the process of developing their in
tellects push aside the process of
developing their bodies. It takes
brains to be a good football, basket
ball, or baseball player. Byron
"Whizzer" White, former All-Amer
ican football back from the Univer
sity of Colorado, was offered a
Rhodes scholarship; "Buddy" Young,
Negro halfback from Illinois, was a
straight "A" student.
The ancient Greeks considered
the development of the body as
important as the development of
the mind. What was good then
is as good or better now.
When Chang, the half-lama in
Hilton's book "Lost Horizon," was
showing Robert Conway and his
friends around Shangri-La, he ut
tered a prize statement —one that
was in reality not so far from
wrong. "Our people," he said,
"would never dream of participat
ing in the games of mimic warfare
that you outsiders practice on your
playgrounds and athletic fields." It
has always been a source of wonder
to me when I think of this quip,
whether or not Chang was not
right.
Football is in a sense nothing more
than "mimic warfare." When it
goes into the professional stage, the
game is reduced to just that. Play
ers play hard—for money —and the
only compensation for a broken
ankle, torn ligaments, or a sprain is
being sidelined for a few weeks,
whfch in professional standards is
nothing more than costful inactiv
ity. Pros are being paid to play, not
to sit on the bench.
