# Dr. Bailey Reads Period Poetry
## 
### 
Reading informally from the
Elizabethan poets, Dr. Margery
Bailey, associate professor of Eng
lish, stressed the simple language,
eerthy tone, and the dramatic quali
ty in the poems of the 17th and early
18th centuries, at the weekly meet
ing in the Briggs Room yesterday.
Remarking that such a turnout for
poetry reading was earth-shaking,
Dr. Bailey read for pleasure with
out noting titles or authors of spe
cific poems.
Zc»t for Life
The Elizabethans wrote with a

feeling for life, relishing it, while
realizing how difficult and transitory
it was. Dr. Bailey began with se
lections from Surrey, Nashe, Raleigh,
Wyatt, Jonson, and Shakespeare's
Fidele.
Dr. Bailey said that merely read
ing did not do justice to many of
the songs and that if any of the
audience ever had the opportunity
to hear them sung they should better
appreciate th£m. She said that the
music closely followed the beat of
the syntax.
Joyful country poems were read
and melancholy ones such as
"Fidele" and Nashe's "Time of
Pestilence." Of the more romantic
and sensual poems that she read,
Dr. Bailey remarked that "sex was
not regarded as something shabby
or sophisticated as it is today.''
Elizabethan Innovation
The Elizabethans introduced into
their verse the dramatic device of
one person speaking to another
which is shown in the change in
quality of tone and language in suc
ceeding stanzas or lines. Of this
type Dr. Bailey read from Sidney
ard others.
Dr. Bailey compared the simple
music of the songs in the plays .of
Shakespeare to that of the American
Stephen Foster. She sang the "Wil
low Song" sung by Desdemona in
"Othello," saying that it was so popu
lar at the time it appeared that
people grew tired of it.
She closed the informal after
noon by reading Shakespeare's twen
ty-ninth sonnet.
Next Monday in the Briggs Room,
which is in the Humanities build
inp on inner Quad, Herbert Meritt
will read from the poetry of Chaucer.
—Barlow and Pinkerton.
