ican quarterback from Stanford,

ball squad today and will play with
the Airdevils against U.C.L.A. in
Los Angeles Friday night.
Comdr. Jim Blewitt said thai
Albert, who is not a professional,

Blewitt made his announcement
at Ihe weekly meeting of the North
ern California football writers to
day and the statement caused more

blue Monday. The rest of the re
port went like this:
121) Stanford IMayers
Ma re hie Schwartz, head Stan
ford football coach, said: "We
have SI) civilians and 40 Navy men
out for football practice. If things
go well, we hope to schedule a
game with a service team later in
the season."
Buck Shaw (his Bears lost to
U.C.L.A. 13-0) remarked: "We
looked bad in losing to U.C.L.A.—
and the Bruins didn't look good in
winning, They had speed in the
person of Cal Rossi. We didn't."
Johnny Baker, coach of vic
torious Fourth Air over St. Ma
ry's Pre-Flight, 20-7, commented:
"The only statement I have to
make is that the officials do too

much whistle blowing. We got
penalized 109 yards—considerable
«1' it undeserved. The officials
seem to forget that our service
boys have been taught to play
rough for three years."
Jimmy Phelan, whose St. Mary's
team overwhelmed C.O.P. 61-0, re
marked: "This boy Walt Meyer.
C.O.P. end, is quite a lad. He
brought down our Spike Cordeiro
from behind when Spike was on a
touchdown run."
