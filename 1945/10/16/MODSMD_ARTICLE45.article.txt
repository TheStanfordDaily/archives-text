# Louis To Defend Crown in June
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.—(UP).—
Midst flashing bulbs and busy tele
phones, the biggest publicity cam
paign in prizefight history was
launched officially today as Heavy
weight Champion Joe Louis signed
ceremoniously to defend his crown
in the ring's richest fight next June.
Louis signed at 20th Century
heudquarters to defend his title
against Billy Conn or '"any suitable
opponent" to be designated by Pro
moter Mike Jacobs.
Force Conn To Sign
The "kicker"- clause about any
suitable opponent was inserted to
whip Conn of Pittsburgh into line
when Billy-the-Kid goes into a hud
dle with Jacobs Wednesday or
Thursday about dividing receipts of
the classic—receipts that Jacobs
estimates may range between $3,-
000,000 and $10,000,000. Conn is ex
pected to sign immediately after this
conference.
Louis signed alone—probably the
first prominent fighter since the days
of Jim Figg to affix his signature
to such an important contract with
out the protective presence of a
manager.
Site Undecided
The exact site and date for the
heavyweight extravaganza were not
specified in the contract, which
stated that they would be determined
by Jacobs "at least 4Q days prior
to the scheduled event." The date
is expected to be about June 26.
Louis said he would prefer to fight
in Detroit, his home city; but Jacobs

emphasized there were many fac
tors to be considered before select
ing the site —seating capacity of the
stadium, television prospects, movie
and radio angles.
With tickets for the big fight sell
ing at $100 tops. Jacobs expects the
gate alone to approximate $3,000,-
000. The addition of receipts from
radio, movies and television may
boost the total take between $7,-
000,000 and $10,000,000. Nothing ever
approximated this in previous box
ing history—not even the two Jack
Dempsey-Gene Tunney classics.
