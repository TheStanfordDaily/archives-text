# Branner Tea To Entertain Living Groups
## 
### 
Branner Hall will entertain at a
tea Sunday afternoon, October 21,
from 3 to 5 in Branner, at which
women from Union Residence, Casa
Ventura, and Lagunita Knoll will be
guests, according to Cathy Morris,
Branner social chairman.
Miss Morris pointed out that the
majority of women now living in
Union and Branner were in fresh
man living groups together last year.
"One of the main purposes of the
tea is to get everyone together
again," she said. She added that
they are also anxious to get ac
quainted with the women from Ven
tura and the Knoll, since many of
them are new to the campus this
year.
Jackie Woolf, chairman of the in
vitation committee, has announced
that special guests will be Miss Mary
Yost, Dean of Women; Miss Ana
stasia Doyle, Director of Residence
for Women; Miss Mary Jane Don
aldson, Director of Union Unit; and

Casa Ventura.
Committee heads are Miss Woolf,
invitations; Barbara Viault, decora
tions; Mary Orr, food; June Sword,
clean-up; Margo Sorzano, serving;
Marilyn Dey, hostesses; and Paula
Wilbur, music.
