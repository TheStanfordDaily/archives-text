SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15.—(UP).
—Thirteen mighty warships of the
U. S. Third Fleet, whose ports of
call for the past three years have
included the Marshalls, the Mari
anas, th? Philippines, Formosa, and
Japan, sailed through the Golden
Gate today to the deafening cheers
of nearly 200,000 San Franciscans.
The USS South Dakota, flag
ship of Adm. William F. Halsey,
pierced through the low-lying fog
at noon as tug and shore whistles,
including the ear-splitting Ferry
Building siren, sounded with such
a clamor that traffic stopped in
downtown sections of the city.
More than 10,000 persons lined
the railings of tlno Golden Gate
bridge to wave and shout to the
navy personnel jamming the rail
ings of the flagship. Halsey, from
the battleship's bridge, smiled and
waved his gloves. Sailors aboard ■.he
South Dakota whistled at the girls
and shouted:
"Yoo hoo! Women!"
As the veteran of 15 major en
gagements and seven invasions
dropped anchor between Alcatraz
island and the Yacht Harbor,
thousands of local residents and
relatives of navy men aboard the
ships cheered and waved Ameri
can flags.
Two navy blimps, bearing "Wel
come Home" banners, and Hellcat
fighter planes circled low over the
returning ships as they pulled into
the bay.
A welcoming committee, com
prised of Gov. Earl Warren, May
or Roger Lapham, Gen. Willis
11. Hale, Fourth Air Force com
mandant; Adm. Royal E. Inger
soll, commander of the Western
Sea Frontier, and Rear Adm.
Carlcton E. Wright, commandant
of the 12th Naval District, board
ed the South Dakota. Ingcrsoll
rushed to Halsey and embraced
him.
Aboard the vessels were 45,000
Allied fighting men, including more
than 5,000 eligible for discharge and

approximately 650 English, Canadian
and Norwegian soldiers and civilians.
After the South Dakota had
anchored, the other ships, all flag
bedecked but battle scarred, sailed
past in procession, 1,000 yards apart.
None of the warships, represent
ing a combined tonnage of more than
177,000, had been in existence before
Pearl Harbor, but they were part of
the force that drove the Japanese
navy from the Pacific.
"Welcome home" ceremonies will
continue tomorrow when units of
the Third Fleet parade up Market
Street to the City Hall. After con
gratulatory speeches, they will be
the city's guests at luncheon. Ilalsey
will be honored at a banquet tomor
row night.
More than 5,000 of the Third
Fleet's personnel, however, will not
participate in the ceremonies be
cause they actually are going
'"home." Eligible for immediate
discharge, they will leave San Fran
cisco in less than 24 hours for
separation centers.

laboratory of the Crosby Research Foundation where he announced
that the Foundation, which he heads, had discovered what he believed
to be a defense against the atomic bomb. He refused to discuss its
basic principle, but hinted that it involved exploding an enemy's
atomic bomb from a great distance.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15.—(UP).
—Thirteen mighty warships of the
U. S. Third Fleet, whose ports of
call for the past three years have
included the Marshalls, the Mari
anas, th? Philippines, Formosa, and
Japan, sailed through the Golden
Gate today to the deafening cheers
of nearly 200,000 San Franciscans.
The USS South Dakota, flag
ship of Adm. William F. Halsey,
pierced through the low-lying fog
at noon as tug and shore whistles,
including the ear-splitting Ferry
Building siren, sounded with such
a clamor that traffic stopped in
downtown sections of the city.
More than 10,000 persons lined
the railings of tlno Golden Gate
bridge to wave and shout to the
navy personnel jamming the rail
ings of the flagship. Halsey, from
the battleship's bridge, smiled and
waved his gloves. Sailors aboard ■.he
South Dakota whistled at the girls
and shouted:
"Yoo hoo! Women!"
As the veteran of 15 major en
gagements and seven invasions
dropped anchor between Alcatraz
island and the Yacht Harbor,
thousands of local residents and
relatives of navy men aboard the
ships cheered and waved Ameri
can flags.
Two navy blimps, bearing "Wel
come Home" banners, and Hellcat
fighter planes circled low over the
returning ships as they pulled into
the bay.
A welcoming committee, com
prised of Gov. Earl Warren, May
or Roger Lapham, Gen. Willis
11. Hale, Fourth Air Force com
mandant; Adm. Royal E. Inger
soll, commander of the Western
Sea Frontier, and Rear Adm.
Carlcton E. Wright, commandant
of the 12th Naval District, board
ed the South Dakota. Ingcrsoll
rushed to Halsey and embraced
him.
Aboard the vessels were 45,000
Allied fighting men, including more
than 5,000 eligible for discharge and

approximately 650 English, Canadian
and Norwegian soldiers and civilians.
