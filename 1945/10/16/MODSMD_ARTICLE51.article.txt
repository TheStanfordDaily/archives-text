# Servility and Fear New Jap Attitude, States MacArthur
## 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 16.—(UP). —Gen. Douglas MacArthur, taking
the case for his policies toward Japan directly to the United States and
the world in a radio broadcast, said today that the complete defeat im
posed upon Japan had reduced her militarists from an attitude of arro
gance to one of "servility and fear." MacArthur spoke at 8 a.m., Tokyo

► time. Before he made the address,
a spokesman said that MacArthur
knows there has been criticisms of
of the details of his work, but is more
interested in effectuating principles
—a task which he believes is being
accomplished.
Surrender Final
MacArthur said Japan was de
feated thoroughly at the time of
surrender, "contrary to some con
cepts that have been advanced."
"Nothing could exceed the abject
ness, the humiliation, the finality of
this surrender," he said. "It is not
only physically thorough, but has
been equally destructive on the Jap
anese spirit.
"From swagger and arrogance, the
former Japanese military have
passed to servility and fear. They
are thoroughly beaten, cowed and
tremble before the terrible retribu
tion the surrender terms upon their
country in punishment for their
great sins."
Victory Due to Unity
MacArthur said the triumph was
due to complete integration "of the
three dimensions, ground, sea and
air" by the military forces arrayed
against Japan.
"The great lesson for the future
is that success in the art of war
depend upon complete integration
of services," he said. "In unity will
lie military strength. We cannot win
with only backs and ends, and no
line. Victory will rest with the
team.
Army Dissolves
Japanese forces in the homeland
completed demobilization today, he
pointed out, and Nippon no longer
reckons as a world power.
Japan formally dissolved her army
general staff Monday. Gen Yoshi
jiro Umezu, its chief, was relieved
of his post and Gen. Sadamu
Shinoura, war minister, was re
moved- as inspector-general of mili
tary education. The staff held dis
soluation ceremonies Saturday.
Japanese sources announced that
an extraordinary session of the diet
will be held about Nov. 10 to con
sider the administrative policies of
Premier Baron Kijuro Shidehara's
cabinet, which succeeded the inef
fective "surrender" cabinet of
Prince Naruhiki Higashi-Kuni.
Model Conquering Army
The General said his occupation
forces, "with a few exceptions, could
well be taken as a model for all
time as a conquering army," and
that "their perfect balance between
implacable firmness in duty on one
hand and resolute restraint from
cruelness and brutalities on the
other has taught a lesson to the
Japanese civil population that is
startling in its impact.
"Nothing has so tended to impress
Japanese thought, not even the
catastrophic fact of military defeat
itself," he continued.
