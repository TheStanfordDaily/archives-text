# Theodore H. Boggs To Advise Debaters on Economic Issues
## Meeting Today to Continue Research On History of Commerce and Tariff 
### 
Theodore H. Boggs, professor of economics, will act as expert adviser
to Debating Society, according to an announcement by Leland T. Chapin
debate coach. Professor Boggs, noted authority on international trade
will aid society members in their preparation for debates on free trade
Debaters will meet again this afternoon to hear reports from their

research committees on the history
of free trade and existing tariff regu
lations. Professor Chapin considers
this essential background.
''Economists are always accused
of not knowing what they are talk
ing about," he said. "We don't like
to swamp our opponents with sta
tistics, but we'll make sure that we
have the facts to back up our state
ments. That way we are certain that
any condemnation on the grounds
that we are theoretical and imprac
tical will be unjust and easy to
refute."
This afternoon's meeting will be
held at four in room 200T of the
history building, according to Pat
Blair, debate manager.
