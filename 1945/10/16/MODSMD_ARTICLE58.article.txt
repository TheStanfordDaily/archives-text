# Robert Bush Urges Stanford Students Interested in Good Future Positions To Register at Apointment Service
## 
### CONNIE McGILLICUDDY 
Stressing the lifelong feature of
the appointment service, Dr. Robert
N. Bush, new director of replace
ments, spoke with enthusiasm for
his new job.
Tall, energetic Dr. Bush declared
that students even remotely inter
ested in future employment should
come to the Appointment Service.
The aim of the service, he explained,
is to have all students registered,
to place these students in good jobs
on graduation, and to continue to
help Stanford men and women to
advance to better positions.
Service Not Automatic
One point Dr. Bush wanted to
clarify was that the registration of
students is not automatic. Any stu
dent who has attended Stanford a
quarter is eligible for the service.
The fee is nbminal and covers the
costs of assembling a file for each
registrant.
The file for each registered stu
dent is quite complete, Dr. Bush
said, including a picture of the per
son, their high school and college
record, their activities while in
school, and their work experience.
School Has Contacts
Because of contacts with former
students and friends of the Uni
versity, the Appointment service
often hears of special opportuni
ties, he explained. As if to prove
his point, just then the phone rang;
it was a wire asking for informa
tion on Stanford students qualified
for a certain teaching position.
"Right now," he said, "we have more
requests for jobs than we can
handle."
Most of the placements, he ex
plained, were for administrative or
teaching jobs in education. Next
highest record of placements was for
engineers. Many placements were
also made, he added, for business
and economics students. In general,
he summarized, the more specific
has been a student's graduation, the
better is his chance for immediate
placement.
Seniors Urged to Register
Seniors he urged to register even
if they now have prospects for a
job on graduation. Four or five years
from now, Dr. Bush prophesied,
the employment picture may change.
He also urged all undergraduates
to keep in contact with the Ap
pointment Service • for another
reason.
"I'm just as interested in talk
ing to a freshman or sophomore and
telling him what his prospects are,
the new director asserted. For in
stance, if he is interested jn be
coming a social studies teacher, he
should know the competition. Per
haps in a certain career he wouldn't
be qualified, perhaps he would be
better in another job. This infor
mation we can share with students."
Helps Public Relations
Dr. Bush summed up his thoughts
with the statement that "when more
people register, this not only helps
the student but improves the school's
public relations with employers. If

we have good candidates," he con
cluded, "they will come back and
ask for more."
Dr. Bush came directly from Kan
sas State Teacher's College in Em
poria, Kansas. There he was Dean
of the college and head of the De
partment of Education. While there
he knew Bill White, son of William
Allen White, founder of the Kansas
Star.
Has Stanford Degree
Before he was head of education,
he was chief of staff. He took his
doctor's degree at Stanford in 1941,
doing his undergraduate and mast
er's work at the Colorado State Col
lege of Education.
He is assisted in the Appointment
Service by Mrs. Isabel Townley
Marx and Miss Adelaide Palmer.
Mrs. Marx and Dr. Bush handle job
placements; while Miss Palmer is
responsible for students with camp
us and off-campus jobs during school
and vacations.
Mrs. Marx is responsible for re
placements in most non-teaching
jobs, Dr. Bush handling requests for
administrative positions in education
and psychology.
Students Shortsighted
Mrs. Marx started work in the
fall of 1939. She is a Stanford grad
uate of 1921. Commenting on the

shortsightedness of seniors who f;«i 1
to register for the placement serv
ice, she remarked on the difference
of registration between the war pe
riod and pre-war times.
Miss Palmer noticed this same
falling off of interest in campus em
ployment. More students have been
completely self-supporting in th«
last few years, she declared. Most
popular jobs, she said have been
hashing, department jobs, clerking
jobs, and ofiice work. Right now,
she said, her problem was providing
jobs for veterans at Stanford. Miss
Palmer is a Stanford graduate of
1930. She worked in the Registrar's
office for three years before becom
ing head of the Student Employ
ment Office in 1940.
