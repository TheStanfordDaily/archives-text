# Anderson Talk Starts Series Of Seminars
## 
### 
The first in a series of bimonthly
seminars conducted by the Romanic
Languages Department was held
Thursday afternoon in the Women's
Clubhouse. Dr. Frederich Anderson
spoke on "The Ideal of the Seminar."
The meetings arc being planned
to inform under-graduatc students
in the Romanic Language Depart
ment of the requirements of gradu
ate work. Stanford professors will
bo the speakers at these seminars.
According to Dr. Anderson the work
of the meetings is to show the na
ture of scientific work in humanities
by having the professors tell what
they have done.
Origin of Seminar Told
In his talk, Dr. Anderson ex
plained the origin of the word sem
inar, and the first use of this edu
cational idea by the Jesuits. He
went on to tell how American edu
cators brought the seminar to this
country after the Civil War.
In a seminar the professor makes
the students understand that their
work is adding to the sum of human
knowledge. They are to learn to
work by themselves, understand
techniques, and perform a great deal
of research.
Scicntilic Methods Commended
In the United States in late years,
universities have begun to use dif
ferent methods for graduate study.
However, Dr. Anderson, in his talk,
"wished to put in a good word for
the scientific study of literature and
the maintenance of seminars." He
added that there is a danger that
literature will be treated as high
class vaudeville.
Dr. Anderson stated that it is a
good thing for a student to devote
a year in looking for evidence and
discovering what it is. He conclud
ed his talk by saying that he hopes
this group of seminars will prove
that scholarly work is that which
has to do with evidence, proof, and
respect for fact.
