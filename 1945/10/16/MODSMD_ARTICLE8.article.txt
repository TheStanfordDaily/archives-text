### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 15 (UP). —
Thousands of International Long
shoremen's Association members
returned to their jobs in New York
harbor today amid increasing in
cidents of violence as efforts to end
completely their 15-day-old strike
were marred by support given AFL
insurgents by CIO leader Harry
Bridges and rival CIO maritime un
ions.
The AFL Central Trades and La
bor Council of Greater New York
demanded that Mayor F. H. La-
Guardia order Bridges out of town,
charging that the West Coast labor
leader was the "man pulling the
strings."
The AFL body, of which the ILA
locals are members, said that a
"substantial" number of the 35,000
involved in the longshoremen's
strike had returned to work on the
basis of LaGuardia s proposal last
Friday that the negotiations on a
new contract be resumed by their
union.
It attacked LaGuardia for pro
posing yesterday a vote of the mem
bership to determine a new nego
tiating committee and said that the
AFL would "take care of its own
members" without the mayor s aid.
The New York Shipping Associa
tion, representing employers, indi
cated it also was not in favor of
the mayor's proposal, which was ac
cepted by the ILA rebel group.
