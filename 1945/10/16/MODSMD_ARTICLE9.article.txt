According to the chairmen of the

Eugene Mitguard announced that
a large number of the tryoutees
have been freshmen. The frosh that

promoted to regular membership if
they prove to be hard workers.
Record Kept
Members of Rally Com stress the
fact that although only a small per
centage of the tryoutees will be
placed on the committee, a record
of all candidates is being kept on
file. When there is more work for

be called upon to work on special
committees.
This extra work will be consid
ered when Rally Com is enlarged
in spring. Students may try out for
the committee as often as they wish.

To Interview
According to the chairmen of the
committee, candidates have been
turned away on the two previous
days of tryouts because of insuffi
cient time. The committee expects
to interview about 30 students to
day.
Eugene Mitguard announced that
a large number of the tryoutees
have been freshmen. The frosh that
are chosen will be placed on an aux
iliary committee and will later be
promoted to regular membership if
they prove to be hard workers.
Record Kept
Members of Rally Com stress the
fact that although only a small per
centage of the tryoutees will be
placed on the committee, a record
of all candidates is being kept on
file. When there is more work for
the group to do, the candidates will
be called upon to work on special
committees.
