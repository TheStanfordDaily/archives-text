is asked from each student. War
Board Representatives in each
campus living unit will aid in the
collections.
The national quota has been set
at $250,000,000 to aid 120,000,000,000
people who are associated with the
various charities.
Off-Campus Drive
Besides the campus drive there
will be an extensive drive among
off-campus students. Aiding off
campus collectors are Twink Dav
ies and Angie Griffiths.
"Letters are being sent to off
campus students and collection
boxes placed in the Cellar and Stu
dent Union for their convenience,"
Barbara Bonner, chairman of the
drive, has announced.

"Women from Branner and Roble
have volunteered to collect at the
booths and must show up at the
times they signed for or send a
substitute," Miss Bonner stressed.
Coordinating, all campus collectors
are Jeannette Grimsley and Bill
Ohlandt. "It is important that all
collectors turn their envelopes into
the War Board office each day and
get new envelopes," Miss Grimsley
said.
Charities Combined
The National War Fund drive com
bines many war-time charities into
one drive. The U.S.O. is one of the
more important of these charities.
The War Fund felt that this work
was too important to discontinue in
spite of the ending of the war with
Japan.
Four million volunteers through
out the nation are carrying on the
anticipated collection of $250,000,-
000. Last year 40,000,000 Americans
contributed to the Fund and its
affiliated charities.
President Harry Truman said, in
connection with the War Fund drive,

that "all efforts like it, related to
ending the war and bringing peace,
should go ahead with full vigor."
