Tradition Observance
Traditions, a part of Stanford life
needing more observance by every
one, were discussed and a decision
reached whereby Stanford students
would be informed more clearly
what traditions there were, and
how they should be observed.
A few of the traditions which have
been neglected are no smoking on
Quad, no women on the Law steps,
no corsages for dances, flowers and
candy for lock-outs, standing up
for the President of the University
in an assembly, and picking up stu
dents standing on the History cor
rer and in Palo Alto who arc wait
ing for a ride.
