## Will Entertain Off-Campus Girls 
### 
All new and lower division ofT
campus women will be feted at the
first Cap and Gown coke party this
afternoon from 3 to 5 p.m. in the
Roble library.
The party which was planned
with the help and assistance of the
"Y" is being given in the hope not
only "that the ofT-campus women
will become better acquainted with
their own group but that this 'get
together' will start the ball rolling
toward the beginning of friendships
with other women students through
out the campus, according to Bar
bara Lamb, president of Cap and
Gown.
Special guests at the gathering
will be Miss Pat and Louise Phillips
of the "Y" and Miss Rosamond
Clarke and K. J. Supple from Roble
Hall. Betsy Rabbitt is in charge of
refreshments.
In order to include women living
off-campus in more of the social
life of Stanford Miss Lamb has re
quested that any house which would
like to invite some of them to a
forthcoming spread or house party
get in touch with her at Lagunita.
Also any girl who would care to
meet several of them should call
Miss Lamb.
