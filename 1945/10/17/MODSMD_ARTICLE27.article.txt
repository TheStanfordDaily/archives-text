# Bomb Poses Old Problem
## Must Prevent Wars—Staley 
### 
The release of atomic bomb
power poses an age-old question
only very greatly intensified—man
must learn how to prevent war or
be destroyed, Dr. Eugene Staley,
lecturer in international trade in
the Graduate School of Business,
declared at the Tuesday Evening
Scries last night.
"Science and industry have out
run the limits of human nature
again," Dr. Staley said, "and have
posed a riddle which man cannot
sidestep."
He outlined the conclusions lie
drew as a result of attending a con
ference recently of scientists, indus
trialists, and others at the Univer
sity of Chicago as follows:
It is not possible to overstate the
power of the bomb. We can take
no comfort in the thought that we
have a secret. Other nations will
have a method of production in from
two to ten years.
If another war comes victors
as well as vanquished will have
their cities demolished. The pos
sibilities of international agree
ment, coupled with an inspection
system, should be explored. The
main problem is not by whom the
bomb should be controlled, but
how to prevent war.
Dr. Staley, who is director of the
Bay Region division of the Institute
of Pacific Relations, pointed out four
alternatives for American policy on
this question.
The first is for America to wage
a "preventative war"" with the ob
ject of conquering all potential
enemies and imposing a Pax Ame
ricana on the world.
The second, also unfeasible, is to
disarm the United States and get the
rest, of the countries to likewise.
The third alternative he proposed
would be the old armaments race
with the atomic bomb the chicf item
of production.
The fourth and most desirable
alternative is to form a world
community organization which
would by common consent control
(he bomb. The way to accomplish
this is to give more power (o the
United Nations to improve our
relations with other nations, par
ticularly the USSR, and to con
struct a sound and progressive
domestic economy.
Dr. Staley was introduced by
Dean Hugh Jackson of the Grad
uate School of Business, who an
nounced next Tuesday's speaker to
be Dr. Russell Lee on "Medicine at
War."—Pinkerton
