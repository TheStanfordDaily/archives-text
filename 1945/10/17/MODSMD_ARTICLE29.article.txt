## RALLY COMMENT 
### 
The old story of "lots to do and nobody to
do it" in student activities is reversed this week
as four senior members of regenerated Rally
Com ponder over dozens of names of fresh
rnen, sophomores, and juniors- all tryoutees
for positions now open on what may appear
lo many to be one of the most glamorous
committees on campus.
From almost 100 applicants, 16 sophomores
and juniois will be chosen (freshmen will be
placed on an auxiliary committee) to work on
Rally Committee which, according to Section
Article IV, of the Activities Council charter,
"shall have exclusive charge of all rallies, pa
rades, rooting sections and stunts, ticket sales
promotions, etc., carried on under the direction
of the Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity, or Cardinals."
All very exciting, isn't it? The only difficulty
is that this quarter there won't be many rallies,
parades, rooting sections and stunts. White
sweatered Rally Com members won't have
much chance to usher at football games or plan
card tricks. Rally Com members this quarter
will have to do the dull, unspectacular work of
building an efficient and capable organization,
accumulating ideas, doing all the small, unin
teresting, important things that go toward
building a broad and sound foundation for
committees of the future. Choice of an active,
representative group of 16 from among the
dozens who applied may be difficult, but the
importance of that choice warrants careful
consideration of candidates' qualifications,
abilities, and above all, their sincere willing
ness to do some hard work.
