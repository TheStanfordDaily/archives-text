# THE 						TEA FORMATION

Congratulations, women students
... for turning thumbs down on a high tea—
a very high tea —that would have involved an
expense of $400, at 35 cents per woman.
. . . for avoiding the rigors of a mile-long re
ception line of women in formals, that would
have effected little besides aching hands and
tired smiles.
. . . for seeing behind the superficial glamour
of such a tea, and realizing that the time has not
yet arrived when Stanford women are justified
in tossing S4OO irretrievably down the drain in
the interests of social graces.
. . . for showing by your rejection that the
level-headed attitude of Stanford women in
wartime has been sufficiently retained to show
up such functions for the meaningless cere
monies they are.—B. M. V.and M. S.
