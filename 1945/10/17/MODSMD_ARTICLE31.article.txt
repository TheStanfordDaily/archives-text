# Bull Session
## 
### Stanley Wilson 
A 20-gun salute should be in order for the citi
zens of San Francisco for the manner in which
they greeted Admiral William (Bull) Halsey
and his battle-starred Third Fleet.
A well rounded and amplified Bronx salute
should be given the Weather Man for fouling
up the ceremonies.
The San Francisco papers gave a gigantic
coverage of the home coming occasion. The
newsmen reported the show from the Golden
Gate bridge, Telegraph Hill, the Bay bridge,
small motor launches, and paddle boards in
Rome instances.
About $340,000,000 worth of ships sailed into
the harbor virtually unseen by most people, but
they were enthusiastically received.
A particularly good yarn appeared in The
Chronicle by Robert O'Brien on the home-com
ing. He was one of the spectators on Telegraph
Hill.
Another good story was recorded by Grady
Johnson, as viewed from a Navy blimp.
We liked the statement by the Admiral when
he said, "There is no cure-all, no one service,
no branch of any service that is going to win a
war alone. It takes teamwork. No one weapon
can do it, including the atomic bomb." Here at
least is one Admiral who doesn't claim the
Navy won the war. * * *
This week has been announced as National
Wine Week. Two to one Mr. Rosetti doesn't
observe it! * . *
And so with the execution of Pierre Laval, the
62-year-old politician who sold out France to
Hitler after serving as his country's premier
three times, another war criminal has been ac
counted for.
As one guipster put it: "How could anyone
'rust a man who spells his name the same way
frontwise or backwards-"
