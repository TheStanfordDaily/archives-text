### Elliot Epsteen 
"LITTLE FRANKIE"
fuvenile delinquency is not the problem that
it was, but it is still rampant. For that reason,
this column is studying a very notorious delin
quent today. True, he was mature in years
when he started his criminal career, but he was
very immature in intellect.
The man himself is not very impressive to
look at: short, with a big moustache and, peep
ing out underneath it, the smile of a confidence
man in whom nobody has any confidence. Yet,
often we find that small bodies encase great
souls, tremendous intellect. In this case, how
ever, everything is very proportional.
"Quite Respectable"
The man, known to his gangland associates
as "Little Frankie," came from a family that con
sidered itself quite respectable. He inherited
that trait —in fact, he still thinks he's an upright
sort of citizen. He also inherited a corollary, the
family's association of a uniform respectability.
So, he joined the army. He even got a com
mission, and pretty soon, he saw action. In the
long campaign, all the generals got killed off,
and "Little Frankie" knew the right people, so
pretty soon he got to be an awfully young, and
awfully inefficient, general himself.
Time for a Change
But things were changing in his neighbor
hood. The reason was that the overwhelming
majority of the people who lived there were
good, kind, talented human beings, and they
had been victimized by his type long enough.
They got arms too, and pretty soon they took
over. Then they started thinking along awfully
radical lines. They believed that man should
be free, that he should have the right to say
and believe what he thought, and that he should
dictate to the government, and not vice versa.
"Little Frankie," however, soon was con
vinced that this was not respectable, that this
was not a moral way of things, and the only
means by which order and the true path of life
could come to his neighbors was through
crooked politicians, mass exiles, and concentra
tion camps.
Comes the Revolution
So, one day, he started a revolution. It was
not a very successful one. In fact, it folded up
about the first day out. The net result was that
he was isolated to a command in the military
styx of his neighborhood - otherwise known
as the Canary Islands.
But there were two other delinquents who
were infinitely more clever than he was. One
was the man known as Gil, a violent reaction
ary, and another, called Juan, was thoroughly
convinced that any talented young boy could
grow up to be a smuggler and make many mil
lions of dollars; that this was the essence of the
capitalistic system; and that this, above all other
things, was right, and should be protected.
They too, wanted to start a revolution. So
they cut "Little Frankie" in as a junior partner.
They got killed in an airplane crash, however,
and "Little Frankie" took over.
At first the revolution didn't go so well, but
then two big international crooks, known as
Benny the Bonehead and Adolph the Ayrian
gove him a hand, pulling him through.
Nobody Loves Him
Well, the revolution was over. But no sooner
did that come than "Little Frankie" had troubles.
First, the independent land owners up in the
north had supported him because they feared
that the central government would nationalize
their holdings, but then Frankie did plenty for
their competitors, the landed artistocracy, and
nothing for them, so they went out of business
right and left. They didn't support him any
longer.
The next problem was the workers. Their
employers had supported him because workers
with rights meant less profits, but then "Little
Frankie tried to show labor that he was really
a good guy, so started passing wage increases
and things. The workers, who remembered all
the people he killed, didn't support him, and the
capitalists, fearing a double-cross, became un
reasonably cold to Frankie's true way of life.
Now, Frankie boasts a full ten percent of the
population in back of him.
Competition
Well, at present, another racketeer, a promi
nent young man in the distillery business,
sometimes known as "The Purple Robe," is
trying to muscle in. Frankie, who sees the bul
lets begin to whiz towards his head—especially
since his big-time partners, Benny the Bone
head and Adolph the Ayrian, are out of busi
ness now—is all for him taking over, but Frank
ie wants to run things. However "The Purple
Robe" doesn't like the idea too much, and wants
to run Frankie.
Still, in this strange drama of "which crook
runs which?" the important thing to remember
is that the good people of the neighborhood
are getting arms again, so soon there might
come the time when justice is again restored to
that corner of the earth.
