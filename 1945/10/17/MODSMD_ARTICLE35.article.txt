### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
The balloting lor this year's Metro
nome All-Star Band has begun!
Each year this national magazine
devoted to the jazz idiom conducts
a poll in which its readers select
the instrumentalists and vocalists
which they would most prefer to
hear in one great unit of perfection.
After the voting has been com
pleted, the editors of Metronome
will endeavor to gather these mu
sicians together for one jam ses
sion extraordinary. This session
will be recorded and distributed by
one of the popular labels. "One
O'clock Jump," "Bugle Call Rag,"
and "Royal Flush" are some of the
tunes cut by past All-Star groups,
including such outstanding artists
as Benny Goodman, Count Basie,
Gene Krupa, Charlie Barnet, and
Coleman Hawkins.
The ballot with instruments list
ed is printed in the October issue
of Mefronome and our choices read
as follows:
Lead Alto Sax—Johnny Hodges,
featured Ellington sideman, who has
long been at the top of his field, is
an undisputed choice.
Hot Alto Sax—Benny Carter is a
musician who has continually held
the admiration and respect of his
fellow artists as an arranger, trump
eter, and above all—an alto.
Clarinet—Benny Goodman—'nuff
said.
Tenor Sax—Don Byas, formerly
with the "Count" and now leading
his own group on 52nd Street, in
our opinion succeeds Coleman
Hawkins as the leading ballad in
terpreter on this instrument.
Tenor Sax—Now with Woody
Herman, "Flip" Phillips has demon
strated on recent records his su
preme understanding of how to. play
a jump chorus. Listen to "Apple
Honey."
Baritone Sax—Being the only bari
tone of note, Harry Carney of the
Ellington aggregation is an inevit
able nomination. •
Lead Trumpet—Cootie Williams
after years of outstanding work
with Ellington and Goodman is now
illustrating his trumpet mastery with
a band of his own.
Hot Trumpets—Roy "Little Jazz"
Eldridge, formerly with Gene Krupa
and now with Artie Shaw, cannot
be overlooked if simply because of
his brilliant technical skill. Buck
Clayton, U. S. Army sideman, must
be selected because of his years of
tasty excellence with Count Basie.
Little known on the West Coast,
Dizzy Gillespie is currently the talk
of swingdom. With his amazing
execution and progressive musical
thinking, this frantic artist surely
deserves a place in this band.
Lead Trombone—The man behind
the scenes in the Ellington brass
section is Lawrence Brown. With
his beautiful and bombastic intona
tion, Brown must rate high in any
one's selections.
Hot Trombones—Bill Harris, "Es
quire Now Star," now with the
Herman Herd has finally reached
the peak he has worked so long for.
The driving style of this musician
makes him a "must." The Eddie
Heywood trombonist, Vic Dickenson,
has only recently proved his merit
in establishing himself as an emi
nent professor in modern sliphorn
ology.
Piano—Our selection of Nat Cole
over Art Tatum as pianist is simply
a matter of sincerity in playing.
We feel that King Cole cannot be
approached in this matter that is
all-important in playing jazz.
Guitar—As the greatest perfec
tionist playing the guitar today Oscar
Moore surely gets the nod above all
others. Listen to any of the King
Cole Trio records if you doubt this.
Bass—Bowing his way to the top
with the Goodman Sextet, Slam
Stewart must be accorded this po
sition on our ballot.
Drums—The choice of Dave Tough
over Sid Cat let t is purely on the
basis of this being a large band in
stead of a small jam unit. Tough's
driving work with Woody Herman
definitely establishes him as the man
for the job. No, we didn't forget
Krupa and Rich!
Miscellaneous Instr.—Here, it is a
matter of opinion—Red Norvo over
Hampton - Vibes.
Male Vocalist Cnn an All-Star be
be completed without Louis Arm
strong?
Female Vocalist — Many new
thrushes have appeared on Ihe swing

scene, including Anila O'Day, Peg
gy Lee. and Thelma Carpenter, to
rival our candidate Billie Holiday.
Large Band—Because of the band's
free expression and ultra-modern
style, Woody Herman is our choice
to succeed last year's winner, Duke.
Small Band—The King Cole Trio
is the only small group to reach a
commercial height without forfeit
ing any of their musical integrity.
For this reason we select this unit
as the outstanding small band in
America.
In conclusion, we would like to
state that in this balloting there is
no attempt to evolve a "Sweet vs.
Swing" argument. Bands of the
commercial calibre of Sammy Kaye,
Freddy Martin, and Guy Lombardo
were not even considered as we be
lieve that the best sweet music can
be played by bands such as we have
indicated. We also offer our apol
ogies and sympathies to the Stan
ford Hot Jazz Society and others
who believe that jazz has not
progressed since 30 years ago in
New Orleans.
