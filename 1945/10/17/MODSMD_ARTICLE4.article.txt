## 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
With men and women constantly
becoming more desirous of these-

curity which a
college education
can offer, Deans
Mary Yost and
John M. Stalna
ker emphasized
the problems of
admission and
housing which
Stanford is now
facing in their
speeches to the
Mothers' Club of
Stanford Univer
sity yesterday af
ternoon.

Housing Is Inadequate
"Amazing numbers of young
women want to be educated, for
they now realize that in a world of
insecurity the best insurance they
can have is education," stated Miss
Yost, Dean of Women. Faced with
n diminished enrollment of men,
Stanford admitted the largest group
of girls in the history of the Uni
versity last spring and is now
caught with inadequate housing fa
cilities for present and prospective
students. Miss Yost said that be
cause of these difficulties women

have been allowed to live ofT-cam
pus for the first time.
With the approach of the winter
quarter over 100 girls want to live
on campus, and according to pres
ent reports there will be less than
25 places open for them, commented
Miss Yost. In addition to this num
ber will be the returning service
women, former Stanford students
and the usual mid-year newcomers.
Admission Is Limited
Mr. Stalnaker gave examples of
the problems confronting a new
dean, explaining that "I don't think
they arc typical because I haven't
been here long enough to know
what is typical." He told of tho
difficulties of admission, especially
those of ex-servicemen whose pre
vious scholastic records are poor
but who want a second chance at
an education.
Stressing the acute problem of
housing, the new Dean of Students
related the troubles of veterans who
are married and have children and
can't find a small house in which
to live.
Benefit Planned
Plans for the chrysanthemum tea,
an annual fall benefit before the
war, were discussed. A fashion
show of Carolyn Kelsey clothes, a
piano duo, and booths selling such
items as cakes, pies and flowers will
provide the entertainment. Tickets
are now on sale for $1.20.
A newcomers' luncheon on Wed
nesday, Oct. 24, in the clubroom of
the South Palo Alto library will
welcome all new members of the
club. Members were also urged to
help with the welfare work, espe
cially at the Thursday meetings in
which alterations are made on
clothes for the ASTP.
