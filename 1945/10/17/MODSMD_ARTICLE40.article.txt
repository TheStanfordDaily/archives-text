"Yes, we hope to sink them all,"
Charlotte Townsend, head of the
Oaks-NROTC open house, admitted
today as she polished applies for
the apple-bobbing contest promised
Navy men Friday night.
Honoring the campus Navy, Oaks
women have invited part of the unit
to an open house Friday evening
between 8:30 and 11:30.
Pre-Halloween pumpkins, dough
nuts, cider and cake are promised
the men, as well as dancing, bridge,
and special games.
