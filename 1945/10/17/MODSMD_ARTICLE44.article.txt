# Roble Girl Tells Of Shanghai Life
## 
### 
"Bloody Saturday will never be
forgotten by the people who were
in Shanghai that day."
This simple statement came from
Barbara Row, Stanford freshman,
who has spent twelve years in
Shanghai, China, where her father
was associated with the Henningsen
Produce Company. Her family lived
on the outskirts of the city in the
French Concession.
Citizens Evacuated
Barbara experienced the first days
of World War 11, when the Jap
anese raided the downtown section
of Shanghai. "In the French Con
cession however, all we got was
shrapnel," she admitted. "The next
day the American consul requested
that every citizen of the United
States evacuate Shanghai and the
surrounding suburbs. Early the fol
lowing morning, we went down to
the bund (breakwater) where we
were put aboard a Chinese tug called
a lender.
"We were crowded into a small
cabin that plainly showed the prev
ious narrow escapes of the boat. The
outside walls had been pierced by
bullets and the windows had been
smashed. It took us an hour sailing
down the Whang Poo River to the
ocean. Jap gun boats lined both
sides of the river. Although they
had agreed to cease firing during
the evacuation, there was continu
ous machine gun fire and dog
fighting going on overhead.
Destination Hong Kong
"As we neared the mouth of the
Whang Poo, the water became in
creasingly rough, and we lurched
from side to side until ' capsizing
seemed inevitable. When we finally
reached open sea, the Italian liner
'Victoria' met us. From there it
took two days to reach Hong Kong.
"The scare only lasted two or
three weeks, so we returned to
Shanghai. The whole affair seemed
like a dream when we got back
and found the population going
nonchalantly about their business as
before."
Barbara described Shanghai as a
very cosmopolitan city, with its
French, Chinese, Philippine, Russian,
German, English, and American
citizens. Contrary to common be
lief, Shanghai is a modern metropo
lis very similar to San Francisco.
Chinese Weddings
"The old Chinese customs still
prevail nevertheless," said this
Robleite. "At a Chinese wedding,
everyone arrives early to eat pea
nuts and oranges while the bride
groom nervously paces up and down
the vestibule in his everyday attire,
waiting for the appointed hour
when he rushes to change into his
rented wedding suit.
"The bride, dressed in a typical
gown of white, walks ceremoniously
down the aisle scattered with pea
nut shells and orange peelings. A
band plays a processional like "Com

j ing Through the Rye," as the groom
I hurries to the altar. After the cere
| mony, the bride and groom are
j ushered out while the band plays
'Yankee Doodle Dandy.'
"There is also a lot of ceremony
connected with their funerals. They
parade through the streets, dressed
in black. The casket is carried in
a cart-like vehicle, as a band drowns
j out the mourners with Hold That
j Tiger'."
Barbara and her mother came to
the United States early in 1942 at
the suggestion of the American
Consul. Her father remained in
I Shanghai where he was interned
|in 1942. In 1945, Mr. Row arrived
on the Gripsholm with the first ex
change ol prisoners. Since then, the
! Rows have resided in Mexico City.

"As we neared the mouth of the
Whang Poo, the water became in
creasingly rough, and we lurched
from side to side until ' capsizing
seemed inevitable. When we finally
reached open sea, the Italian liner
'Victoria' met us. From there it
took two days to reach Hong Kong.
"The scare only lasted two or
three weeks, so we returned to
Shanghai. The whole affair seemed
like a dream when we got back
and found the population going
nonchalantly about their business as
before."
Barbara described Shanghai as a
very cosmopolitan city, with its
French, Chinese, Philippine, Russian,
German, English, and American
citizens. Contrary to common be
lief, Shanghai is a modern metropo
lis very similar to San Francisco.
Chinese Weddings
"The old Chinese customs still
prevail nevertheless," said this
Robleite. "At a Chinese wedding,
everyone arrives early to eat pea
nuts and oranges while the bride
groom nervously paces up and down
the vestibule in his everyday attire,
waiting for the appointed hour
when he rushes to change into his
rented wedding suit.
"The bride, dressed in a typical
gown of white, walks ceremoniously
down the aisle scattered with pea
nut shells and orange peelings. A
band plays a processional like "Com

j ing Through the Rye," as the groom
I hurries to the altar. After the cere
| mony, the bride and groom are
j ushered out while the band plays
'Yankee Doodle Dandy.'
"There is also a lot of ceremony
connected with their funerals. They
parade through the streets, dressed
in black. The casket is carried in
a cart-like vehicle, as a band drowns
j out the mourners with Hold That
j Tiger'."
Barbara and her mother came to
the United States early in 1942 at
the suggestion of the American
Consul. Her father remained in
I Shanghai where he was interned
|in 1942. In 1945, Mr. Row arrived
on the Gripsholm with the first ex
change ol prisoners. Since then, the
! Rows have resided in Mexico City.
"Bloody Saturday will never be
forgotten by the people who were
in Shanghai that day."
This simple statement came from
Barbara Row, Stanford freshman,
who has spent twelve years in
Shanghai, China, where her father
was associated with the Henningsen
Produce Company. Her family lived
on the outskirts of the city in the
French Concession.
Citizens Evacuated
Barbara experienced the first days
of World War 11, when the Jap
anese raided the downtown section
of Shanghai. "In the French Con
cession however, all we got was
shrapnel," she admitted. "The next
day the American consul requested
that every citizen of the United
States evacuate Shanghai and the
surrounding suburbs. Early the fol
lowing morning, we went down to
the bund (breakwater) where we
were put aboard a Chinese tug called
a lender.
"We were crowded into a small
cabin that plainly showed the prev
ious narrow escapes of the boat. The
outside walls had been pierced by
bullets and the windows had been
smashed. It took us an hour sailing
down the Whang Poo River to the
ocean. Jap gun boats lined both
sides of the river. Although they
had agreed to cease firing during
the evacuation, there was continu
ous machine gun fire and dog
fighting going on overhead.
