history from 1 !).*{.*{ to the present. Hie purpose of these articles is to ac
quaint Stanford students with the traditions that have made the Big
Red grid machines so important a part of campus life.—Editor's note)
The Vow Boys kept rolling in '34. Under the able direction of Coach
Claude "Tiny" Thornhill, the mighty Indians retained their newly won
supremacy in Pacific Coast grid circles as they powered through a ten
game schedule with nine victories and one lone tie at the hands of an
always-strong Santa Clara eleven.
With the exception of Ail-American guard Bill Corhus, the same
Cardinal aces who led the Stanford victory parade in '33 returned to
spark the edition of the Big Red machines. Bohby Grayson, Bones
Hamilton, Frank Alusti/.a, Boh Reynolds, Monk Moscrip. and the rest of
the famous Vow Boys who had taken a solemn oath never to lose to
L'.S.C. during their three seasons of varsity competition, were juniors
now, and aided by end Keith Topping and halfback Buck Van Delicti,
both seniors, they turned out their most successful record.
BRONCS EARN 7-7 TIE
After an easy victory over San Jose State in the opener, the Indians
ran into strong competition when they battled Santa Clara's Broncos. For
three quarters, Stanford held the upper hand, but a last-period rally by
the Broncos earned them a 7-7 tie.
The Cards opened their defense of the Pacific Coast Conference crown
in Portland the next week by waxing Oregon State, 17-0. Northwestern
was an easy victim, losing by a 20-0 count, but the U.S.F. Dons almost
pulled the upset of upsets by holding the overconfident Indians to a 3-0
score in a supposedly breather game. A last-minute field goal by Monk
Moscrip saved the day for Thornhill's eleven.
U.S.C., no longer the mighty eleven of old but still dangerous, came
north the following Saturday determined to whip the team that had
vowed never to lose to them. However, the powerful Indian attack,
sparked by Bobby Grayson at fullback, proved too much for El Trojan,
and for the second year the Vow Boys kept to their promise as they
handed the southerners a 1(5-0 lacing.

CAIt!)S CLINCH ROSE BOWL
U.C.L.A. was Stanford's next victim, suffering a 27-0 trouncing, but
Ihe Washington eleven which battled the Indians the next week was un-

I beaten in Conference play and
J generally expected to provide a
j tough obstacle for the Rose Bowl
: bound Stanford express. Once
I again, however, Grayson, Hamilton
j and Co. put together their unstop
j pable offense and smothered the
Huskies, 24-0, to virtually assure
themselves another Coast title.
After the Redshirts had won a
decisive 40-0 from a feeble Olympic
Club squad, they invaded Berkeley
for the 40th Big Game with Cali
fornia. With Grayson, Moscrip, and
Topping on the sidelines with in
juries, the Indians, ranking as 4-1
favorites, found the going mighty
rough and were barely able to
squeeze through with a 9-7 win.
Carl Schott, subbing at end for
Moscrip, became the hero for the
day as he first blocked a Bear punt
to set up the touchdown and then
booted a field goal to provide the
margin of victory. A 30-yard toss
from Arleigh Williams to Jack Brit
tingham marked the first score
against Stanford in the whole sea
son of Conference play.
Again l'epresenting the West in
the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day,
Stanford encountered a scrappy
Alabama team which scored 22
points in one quarter to come from
behind and whip the favored Cards,
29-13. Dixie Howell and Don Hut
son paced the Crimson Tide attack
that sent Stanford's Vow Boys down
to their second straight Rose Bowl
loss.
Both Bobby Grayson and Monk
Moscrip were strongly heralded for
All-American honors and Keith
Topping, playing his last year at
the other picket post, was also
mentioned.

The Vow Boys kept rolling in '34. Under the able direction of Coach

BRONCS EARN 7-7 TIE
After an easy victory over San Jose State in the opener, the Indians
ran into strong competition when they battled Santa Clara's Broncos. For
three quarters, Stanford held the upper hand, but a last-period rally by
the Broncos earned them a 7-7 tie.
The Cards opened their defense of the Pacific Coast Conference crown
in Portland the next week by waxing Oregon State, 17-0. Northwestern
was an easy victim, losing by a 20-0 count, but the U.S.F. Dons almost
pulled the upset of upsets by holding the overconfident Indians to a 3-0
score in a supposedly breather game. A last-minute field goal by Monk
Moscrip saved the day for Thornhill's eleven.
U.S.C., no longer the mighty eleven of old but still dangerous, came
north the following Saturday determined to whip the team that had
vowed never to lose to them. However, the powerful Indian attack,
sparked by Bobby Grayson at fullback, proved too much for El Trojan,
and for the second year the Vow Boys kept to their promise as they
handed the southerners a 1(5-0 lacing.

j and Co. put together their unstop
j pable offense and smothered the
Huskies, 24-0, to virtually assure
themselves another Coast title.
After the Redshirts had won a
decisive 40-0 from a feeble Olympic
Club squad, they invaded Berkeley
for the 40th Big Game with Cali
fornia. With Grayson, Moscrip, and
Topping on the sidelines with in
juries, the Indians, ranking as 4-1
favorites, found the going mighty
rough and were barely able to
squeeze through with a 9-7 win.
Carl Schott, subbing at end for
Moscrip, became the hero for the
day as he first blocked a Bear punt
to set up the touchdown and then
booted a field goal to provide the
margin of victory. A 30-yard toss
from Arleigh Williams to Jack Brit
tingham marked the first score
against Stanford in the whole sea
son of Conference play.
Again l'epresenting the West in
the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day,
Stanford encountered a scrappy
Alabama team which scored 22
points in one quarter to come from
behind and whip the favored Cards,
29-13. Dixie Howell and Don Hut
son paced the Crimson Tide attack
that sent Stanford's Vow Boys down
to their second straight Rose Bowl
loss.
Both Bobby Grayson and Monk
Moscrip were strongly heralded for
All-American honors and Keith
Topping, playing his last year at
the other picket post, was also
mentioned.
