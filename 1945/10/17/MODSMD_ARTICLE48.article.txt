The statement made by this writ
er, "that the bay area was now
supporting two of the best teams
on the coast," seems to have been
a poor prediction. The California
Bears, after their 13-0 loss at the
hands of UCLA last Saturday, are
right back near their old standing
in the cellar. Our statement that
St. Mary's was one of the top teams
in the nation still stands without
reservation. The Gaels from Moraga
had an easy time last week when
they squelched Stagg's boys from
Pacific.
This Sunday Wedemyer and Co.
play McClellan Field at Sacramento.
The Gaels were originally sched
uled to play Camp Beale, but be
cause of the refusal of the army
team to switch the game from the
camp to Sacramento the contest was
called off, and the Fliers were
thrown in to fill the gap. Since Mc-
Clellan was beaten by the Stockton
Commandos 27-0, and St. Mary's
defeated the Commandos 26-0, there
should be little trouble for the Gaels
ihis week.
Shaw Has Answer
Buck Shaw, the California coach,
came back from his unsuccessful
campaign at Los Angeles with some
good deductions why his backfield
isn't doing so hot. It seems that he
has discovered that his squad is
lacking in speed which is a definite
must when you use the T-forma
tion. He also found out that he has
Kenfield and Agnew in each other's
positions. In other words Kenfield
should be at half and Agnew at
quarter.
Kenfield is a much faster man
than Agnew and his talents are go
ing to waste at quarter, whereas
Agnew is a much better passer than
Ted, and passing, in the T, is one
of the main jobs of the quarter
back. Cal has an open date this
weekend and Shaw is going to try
and get a remodeled backfield into
shape before the Nevada game a
week from Saturday.
Papers Plan Indian Schedule
It is odd the way all the sport
scribes are trying to plan Stanford's
football schedule. We got a report
today that a Stockton paper said
that the Stanford football team was
going to play the Stockton Com
mandos here on November 16. A
check with the proper officials
proved the report false. Not even
the coach knows who we are going
to play.
