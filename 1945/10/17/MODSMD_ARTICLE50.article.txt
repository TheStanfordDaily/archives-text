# Intra-Mural Football
## 
### 
The three intramural league races
began to clear up a little yesterday
as the newly-l'ormed Army power
house showed itself the classiest of
League 111 by trouncing the high
ly-regarded Phi Psis, 32-6, and the
Hilltoppers moved to the fore in
League II by crushing previously
unbeaten Jefferson, 26-0. The Kap
pa-Dee Gee Hashers and the BBC
Fills still look like the cream of the
crop in League I as both won con
vincing victories.
The Army team, playing their
first league contest, showed tre
mendous power in outclassing the
Phi Psis, who have lost several
of their top players to varsity
football. The big soldier sextet
started rolling early in the con
test and were never headed. Dick
Crane tallied for the Phi Psis'
only score.
In the other League 111 game, Taft
Hall won by forfeit from Hayes Hall.
In the feature League II battle,
the classy-loking Hilltoppers scored
three touchdowns and three safe
ties to overwhelm the Jefferson
team by a wide margin. Ernie Webb,
speedy Hilltopper halfback, ran his
point total to 24 in two games, and
Milt Levy, playing his first game at
end, snagged two pay dirt passes to
spark the victors' attack. The Hill
toppers have a fast, tricky offense
that looks plenty hard to stop at
this point.
Cleveland, hopelessly beaten in
their first two games, pulled the
big upset ol the afternon by wal
loping a weakened Firehouse team,
19-7. The Firehouse, rated high
at the beginning of the season,
has lost several men to the vars
ity and doesn't figure as a leading
contender anymore.
The Kappa-Dee Gees, with Willie
Da vies dragging down two scoring

heavers from the arm of Joe Sher, j
eliminated Encina 111 as a title con
tender in League I, winning by a
22-G margin in a game played Sat
urday. With all six of their first
stringers lost to varsity sports, the
Kappa-Dee Gees may find the go
ing rough from now on but certain
ly look powerful at this writing.
The BBC Fills stayed hot on the
heels of the Kappa-Dee Gees by
plastering Pierce Hall, 24-G. Jack
Wods, halfback, and Bernie Camp
bell, end, each scored 12 points for
(.he winners.
The third League I game found
Mtdics A opening their season in
strong style by overwhelming a hap- j
less Van Buren outfit, 47-0. If the
Medics can keep that attack roll
ing, they may be in there pitching
for the title at the end.
A scheduled League II contest be
tween Jackson and Encina II was
tentatively postponed until Satur
day.—Gilkey.

vincing victories.
The Army team, playing their
first league contest, showed tre
mendous power in outclassing the
Phi Psis, who have lost several
of their top players to varsity
football. The big soldier sextet
started rolling early in the con
test and were never headed. Dick
Crane tallied for the Phi Psis'
only score.
In the other League 111 game, Taft
Hall won by forfeit from Hayes Hall.
In the feature League II battle,
the classy-loking Hilltoppers scored
three touchdowns and three safe
ties to overwhelm the Jefferson
team by a wide margin. Ernie Webb,
speedy Hilltopper halfback, ran his
point total to 24 in two games, and
Milt Levy, playing his first game at
end, snagged two pay dirt passes to
spark the victors' attack. The Hill
toppers have a fast, tricky offense
that looks plenty hard to stop at
this point.
Cleveland, hopelessly beaten in
their first two games, pulled the
big upset ol the afternon by wal
loping a weakened Firehouse team,
19-7. The Firehouse, rated high
at the beginning of the season,
has lost several men to the vars
ity and doesn't figure as a leading
contender anymore.
The Kappa-Dee Gees, with Willie
Da vies dragging down two scoring

heavers from the arm of Joe Sher, j
eliminated Encina 111 as a title con
tender in League I, winning by a
22-G margin in a game played Sat
urday. With all six of their first
stringers lost to varsity sports, the
Kappa-Dee Gees may find the go
ing rough from now on but certain
ly look powerful at this writing.
The BBC Fills stayed hot on the
heels of the Kappa-Dee Gees by
plastering Pierce Hall, 24-G. Jack
Wods, halfback, and Bernie Camp
bell, end, each scored 12 points for
(.he winners.
The third League I game found
Mtdics A opening their season in
strong style by overwhelming a hap- j
less Van Buren outfit, 47-0. If the
Medics can keep that attack roll
ing, they may be in there pitching
for the title at the end.
A scheduled League II contest be
tween Jackson and Encina II was
tentatively postponed until Satur
day.—Gilkey.
The three intramural league races
began to clear up a little yesterday
as the newly-l'ormed Army power
house showed itself the classiest of
League 111 by trouncing the high
ly-regarded Phi Psis, 32-6, and the
Hilltoppers moved to the fore in
League II by crushing previously
unbeaten Jefferson, 26-0. The Kap
pa-Dee Gee Hashers and the BBC
Fills still look like the cream of the
crop in League I as both won con
vincing victories.
