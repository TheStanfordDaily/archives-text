# Indian Squad Works Out
## 
### 
Exercises, passing, and kicking
have been the order of the day for
the football practices that have been
held. Coach Schwartz, aided by
Fritzie Wilcox, is getting the squad
into first-class physical shape be
fore any scrimmaging is done.
About 120 men have reported for
practice, and out of this group only

about 50 have had any real grid ex
perience before. The coaches don't
have any "line" on present informa
tion, so it will be another week be
fore any talent can be singled out
as being potential high-caliber var
sity material.
No arrangements as yet have been
made regarding the scheduling of
| any games for this season.
