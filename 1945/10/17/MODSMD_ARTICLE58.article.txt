# Tennis Tourney Ends First Round
## 
### 
Margo Sorzano and Willie Davis
entered the second round of the
all-campus mixed doubles tennis
tournament yesterday by defeating
Marg Hoover and R. Milton.
Trouble, though, is in sight for j
the Sorzano-Davis team when they i
tackle Connie Wheeler and Tom Sco- j
field in their second round match.
Wheeler-Scofield easily trounced
Phyllis Moore-Charles Homer, 6-1,
6-0, in their first round match.
Feature attraction of the second
round is the Dickie Shainwald-Lar
ry Poteat v. Gregg Coward-Bill
Dabney match. Second-seeded Cow
ard-Dabney won their first round
match from B. J. King-Bill Ross,
(i-2, 7-5, while Shainwald-Poteat de
feated Jeanne Soule-Mel Bruno,
10-3. G-2.
Anticipated close second round
matches are the Pat Anderson-Dave
Basham v. Marianne Supple-Joe
Owen encounter and the Tappy Kim
ball-George Leong v. Anne Carter-
Gil Seton match.
Gene Corman and Barbara Brooke,
who drew a first round bye, re
mained easy favorites to win the
five week tournament. The Corman-
Brooke combination shouldn't have
too much trouble in their second
round match against Laura Bliss
and Martin Hoist.
First round results, besides the
Davis-Sorzano victory and the re
sult sprinted in yesterday's Daily,
are:
Robert Mace-R. McLain victory
by default from Marcia Blair-AI
Hart.
Marianne Supple-Joe Owen vic
tory by default from Eleanor Sav
age-Jim Murdock.
