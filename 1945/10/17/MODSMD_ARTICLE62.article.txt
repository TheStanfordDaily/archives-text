CHICAGO, Oct. 16 (UP).—Steel
production, backbone of America's
peacetime reconversion, declined at
an alarmingly fast rate tonight un
der the weight of the collapse of ne
gotiations between soft coal opera
tors and United Mine Workers.
More than 20,000 steel workers in
the Pittsburgh area alone were
thrown out of jobs as the walkout
among miners spread to other pits
with 200,000 mine workers striking.
These idled men accounted for al
most half the 464,000 American
workers thrown out of work by
labor strikes in hundreds of plants.
The soft coal negotiations, over
bargaining rights for supervisory
workers, collapsed after eight days
of talks sponsored by Secretary of
Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach. The
collapse brought a gloomy predic
tion from Harold L. Ickes, Secretary
of the Interior, who said the fuel
problem would become "very se
rious" in some parts of the country
by next week if the mine strikes
continued.
