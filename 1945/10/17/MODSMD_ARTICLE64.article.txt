WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UP).â€”
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, in a
report to President Truman, has de
nied charges that U.S. military
forces had mistreated Jewish refu
gees in Germany, the White House
revealed today.
Eisenhower's firmly worded de
fense of his policy and practices in
the U.S. occupation zone of Ger
many was contained in a letter dated
Oct. 8. He took exception to a recent
report by Earl G. Harrison, U.S.
representative on the inter-govern
mental committee on refugees,
which included a charge that U.S.
military government forces "appear
to be treating the Jews as the Nazis
treated them." He said the Harri
son report was misleading.
Eisenhower acknowledged that "in
certain instances we have fallen be
low standard," but he denied mis
treatment of Jews and said the
problem must be considered in its
full perspective.
