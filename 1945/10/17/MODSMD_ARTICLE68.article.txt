mously to go out of business by

ment moves to end the 2(J-day

high administration oflicials urged
higher basic wages as a possible
cure for the wave of reconversion
strikes. Congress, meanwhile,

son, who conferred with other board
members at the White House yes
terday, said the board decided to
go ahead with its liquidation be
cause of the end of the no-strike,
no-lockout pledge.
The WLB unanimously decidcd
that beginning next Monday:
1. —It will accept only those
disputes in which the parties
have agreed to abide by the board
decision. But the hoard will limit
its action on such cases to the
naming of an arbitrator only. It
will not hear the cases on their
merits and issue a decision as
heretofore.
2.—lt will issue no directive or
ders in cases accepted since the end
of the war. Instead, it will make
only recommendations for the set
tlement of those disputes from
which no appeals will be permitted.
3.—lt will however, process all
cases received prior to the end of
the Japanese war in accordance
with the board's wartime proce
dure, including directive orders
and the right of appeal.

4. —Later it will announce a pro
gram for carrying out its stabilia
tion functions until the end of the
stabilization next June.
