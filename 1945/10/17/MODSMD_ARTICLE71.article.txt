# 'Conflict' Features Fake Climax; Corn Too Green
## 
### 
CONFLICT —now playing at the
Varsity Theater.
"Conflict" opens with a petty do-

mestic squabble
between Humph
rey Bogart and
Rose Hobart, fol
lowing which ihe
couple attend an
anniversary party
thrown in iheir
honor by Sidney
Greenstreet, a
leering college
psychology pro
fessor. Green-

street then proceeds to spiel some
fak? Hollywood gimmick about a
thought being a maligant disease
that is liable to consume you.
Whereupon Bogart kills Hobart and
the picture disintegrates into not
much of anything. All of which
sounds like something torn from the
pages of Racy Detective magazine.
Smith Holds Bag
"Conflict" is a study in frustration.
Miss Hobart cashes in her chips for
good, Bogart is stupid enough to be
caught, and Alexis Smith, who is

infatuated with Bogart, is left hold
ing the well-known paper bag. It's
tough to take, but you paid the
60c to see this thing.
"Conflict" was made back in 1942
and why Warners held the film back
is somewhat of a mystery, unless
they were afraid to exhibit it.
But there are one or two admir
able points that should be noted.
One is the restrained manner in
which the whole aflair is presented.
Cheap emotionalism would have
been too much. And another en
couraging factor is Humphrey Bo
gart's rather touching portrayal of
something that's supposed to re
semble the typical henpecked hus
band.
"Green Corn"
"The Corn Is Green" is the sec
ond feature, with Bctte Davis
struggling through the role created
by Ethel Barrymore on the stage.
It's a warmed-over, scrubbed-down
version of "How Green Was My
Valley" and lacks the social sig
nificance of its predecessor, (what
ever that may mean.)
Briefly, the plot revolves around
the efforts of Miss Davis to raise a
young Welsh miner from obscurity
to Oxford. During this tedious
process Miss Davis's protegee be
comes involved with a rather world- !

ly young woman and many a young
Stanford woman was heard to titter.
Davis Too Young
Miss Davis seems to this reviewer
still to young for such a motherly
role and somehow one can't believe
her relations with this young gen
ius are entirely platonic.
If the corn is only green now,
I'd hate to see it when it's ripe.—
Dick Bower.

ond feature, with Bctte Davis
struggling through the role created
by Ethel Barrymore on the stage.
It's a warmed-over, scrubbed-down
version of "How Green Was My
Valley" and lacks the social sig
nificance of its predecessor, (what
ever that may mean.)
Briefly, the plot revolves around
the efforts of Miss Davis to raise a
young Welsh miner from obscurity
to Oxford. During this tedious
process Miss Davis's protegee be
comes involved with a rather world- !

ly young woman and many a young
Stanford woman was heard to titter.
Davis Too Young
Miss Davis seems to this reviewer
still to young for such a motherly
role and somehow one can't believe
her relations with this young gen
ius are entirely platonic.
If the corn is only green now,
I'd hate to see it when it's ripe.—

CONFLICT —now playing at the
Varsity Theater.
"Conflict" opens with a petty do-

mestic squabble
between Humph
rey Bogart and
Rose Hobart, fol
lowing which ihe
couple attend an
anniversary party
thrown in iheir
honor by Sidney
Greenstreet, a
leering college
psychology pro
fessor. Green-

street then proceeds to spiel some
fak? Hollywood gimmick about a
thought being a maligant disease
that is liable to consume you.
Whereupon Bogart kills Hobart and
the picture disintegrates into not
much of anything. All of which
sounds like something torn from the
pages of Racy Detective magazine.
Smith Holds Bag
"Conflict" is a study in frustration.
Miss Hobart cashes in her chips for
good, Bogart is stupid enough to be
caught, and Alexis Smith, who is

infatuated with Bogart, is left hold
ing the well-known paper bag. It's
tough to take, but you paid the
60c to see this thing.
"Conflict" was made back in 1942
and why Warners held the film back
is somewhat of a mystery, unless
they were afraid to exhibit it.
But there are one or two admir
able points that should be noted.
One is the restrained manner in
which the whole aflair is presented.
Cheap emotionalism would have
been too much. And another en
couraging factor is Humphrey Bo
gart's rather touching portrayal of
something that's supposed to re
semble the typical henpecked hus
band.
"Green Corn"
"The Corn Is Green" is the sec
ond feature, with Bctte Davis
struggling through the role created
by Ethel Barrymore on the stage.
It's a warmed-over, scrubbed-down
version of "How Green Was My
Valley" and lacks the social sig
