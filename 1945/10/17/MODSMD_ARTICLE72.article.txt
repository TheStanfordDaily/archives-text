WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UP).â€”
Representatives of labor and small
business disagreed sharply over
which group should get the greater
measure of relief under the admin
istration's proposed $5,335,000,000
tax reduction program.
Spokesmen for both groups ap
pealed before the Senate Finance
Committee which is considering
House-approved legislation to pro
vide more than $5,000,000,000 in tax
relief next year and $2,000,000,000
addition in 1947.
Those from the Congress of In
dustrial Organizations urged that the
accent be placed upon the small
wage earner by giving him at least
$6,500,000,000 in tax savings in
1946. But the CIO said the present
95 per cent cxcess profits tax against
corporations should be retained and
little business should get a corporate
tax exemption of $5,000 while ex
isting rates for corporate enterprises
whose net incomes are under $100,-
000 should be lowered.
