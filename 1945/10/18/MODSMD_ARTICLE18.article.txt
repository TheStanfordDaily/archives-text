# Stanford War Fund Below $6,000 Quota; Roble 2C Takes Lead
## Groups Asked To Turn In Collection Totals 
### 
Stanford was far below the war
fund quota today, Barbara Bon
ner, drive chairman stated. "We
have only had $1,340 collected to
wards the $6,000 Farm quota.
"Only four halls have gone above
the 50 per cent mark," Miss Bonner
added, "and the drive ends in two
more days."
Roble 2-C took the lead in the
week-long war fund drive as the
Roble corridor soared their total
to !M per cent. Far ahead of other
Roble units reporting, 2-C was
only 9 per ccnt away from be
coming the first living group to
collect 100 per ccnt.
Storey House leads the Row dis
trict reporting 75 per cent, while
Pierce Hall leads the men's division
with 59 per cent of their collection
being reported.
The war fund drive, which ends
this weekend, aids campus and
community charities. Probably
the most important recipient of the
drive is the Dimes for Diplomas,
aiding more students to receive
their University degrees.
Besides the diploma fund, which
receives 30 per cent of all the mon
ey collected, the Palo Alto-Stan
ford War Chest receives 30 per cent
and the World Student Service
Fund, 25 per cent. The March of
Dimes will receive 10 per cent of
the campus collection and 5 per
cent will be placcd in a floating
fund.
The Stanford quota has been
set at $0,000 and War Board Rep
resentatives in each residence arc
collecting $4 from each student.
"Letters are being sent to off
campus students and booths are be
ing placed in the Cellar and Stu
dent Union for the convenience of
these students," Barbara Bonner,
chairman of the drive, has an
nounced.
OfT-campus chairmen arc Twink
Davics and Angie Griffiths. Wom
an's coordinator for living units
is Jcancttc Grimsley, while Bill
Ohlandt is handling the men's
halls.
As yet, a very small percentage
of men's halls have reported their
results to Mitzi Gates, who is keep
ing office hours this week in the
War Board office.
"All living units who have not
reported their results to me must
do so as soon as possible," Miss
Gates said. "It is important that
we find out how much money is
being collected on campus for the
War Fund and (hat War Board
Representatives make »a report
and turn their collection enve
lopes into me," she continued.
Roble girls have signed up to
carry on the off-campus collec
tion in the Cellar and Student
Union and these girls must show

II lie Costigan, Phyllis Graham,
Nancy Spackman, Bonnie Hansen,
and Phyllis Sutherland.
Juniors: Don Foster, Wallace Mc-
Call, Hugh Klopenstain, Patty Rob
inson, Ruth Levinson, and Judy
Peake.
Freshmen: Glen Fish back, Ed
Leftcourt, Michael Mitchel, Bob
Lufeldt, Dot Hughes, Margaret Be
mus, Gail Templeton, and Barbara
Lee Coooper.
The new members were nominat
ed by a Rally Com board of four
old members: Patty Whittemore,
women's head; Eugene Mitguard,
men's head; Julie Crommelin; and
Mary Jane Clatworthy. They were
approved by Cardinals in its meet
ing Tuesday night.
Excom also approved a budget of
$19.1.50 for Rally Com. The money
will go toward getting needed sup
plies for Rally Com to use for com
mittee function, explained jMit
guard. Two rallies have been tenta
tively planned for fall quarter, he
said, but the real work of the pres
ent committee will be to set the
committee work in motion, and re
vive Stanford spirit—particularly
where it applies to Farm traditions.
Fred Bremenkamp announced
that with the cooperation of the ad
ministration and students, the Un

the evenings from 9 to 10:30. Only
on? more Cellar hasher is needed
before the Cellar opens, he said.
An Excom-appointed Reg Day
Procedures Committee, staffed by
Crane Honeysett, Loraine Streblow,
and Gloria Anderson, reported on
proposed methods to improve com
ing Reg Days. Among suggestions
made by the committee were to
have a separate day for freshman
registration, to move the place
where frosh pictures are taken, to
change the women's gym set-up on
Reg Day, and to have Reg books
turned in some other place than the
Administration Building.
The committee will make further
reports and suggestions at later
meetings.
It was proposed that some list
of students interested in activities
be made, to facilitate the appoint
ing of committees, and to assure all
those interested a chance to work
on student committees. ASSU Presi
dent Bob Kennedy asked each rep
resentative to bring a list of not
more than 15 names of students
from their respective areas to the
next Excom meeting.
Frank de Lisle , appointed last
week to investigate the organiza
tion of a Men's Interhall Excom
similar to the women's Row Excom,
reported his findings. He stated that
hall men arc interested in organiz
ing an excom primarily to bring
them in closer touch with student
government.

An Excom-appointed Reg Day
Procedures Committee, staffed by
Crane Honeysett, Loraine Streblow,
and Gloria Anderson, reported on
proposed methods to improve com
ing Reg Days. Among suggestions
made by the committee were to
have a separate day for freshman
registration, to move the place
where frosh pictures are taken, to
change the women's gym set-up on
Reg Day, and to have Reg books
turned in some other place than the
Administration Building.
The committee will make further
reports and suggestions at later
meetings.
It was proposed that some list
of students interested in activities
be made, to facilitate the appoint
ing of committees, and to assure all
those interested a chance to work
on student committees. ASSU Presi

resentative to bring a list of not
more than 15 names of students
from their respective areas to the
next Excom meeting.
Frank de Lisle , appointed last
week to investigate the organiza

"Only four halls have gone above
the 50 per cent mark," Miss Bonner
added, "and the drive ends in two
more days."
Roble 2-C took the lead in the
week-long war fund drive as the
Roble corridor soared their total

The war fund drive, which ends
this weekend, aids campus and

ey collected, the Palo Alto-Stan
ford War Chest receives 30 per cent
and the World Student Service
Fund, 25 per cent. The March of
Dimes will receive 10 per cent of
the campus collection and 5 per

War Board office.
"All living units who have not
reported their results to me must
do so as soon as possible," Miss

War Fund and (hat War Board
Representatives make »a report

Stanford was far below the war
fund quota today, Barbara Bon
ner, drive chairman stated. "We
have only had $1,340 collected to
wards the $6,000 Farm quota.
"Only four halls have gone above
the 50 per cent mark," Miss Bonner
added, "and the drive ends in two
more days."
Roble 2-C took the lead in the
week-long war fund drive as the
Roble corridor soared their total
to !M per cent. Far ahead of other
Roble units reporting, 2-C was
only 9 per ccnt away from be
coming the first living group to
collect 100 per ccnt.
Storey House leads the Row dis
trict reporting 75 per cent, while
Pierce Hall leads the men's division
with 59 per cent of their collection
being reported.
The war fund drive, which ends
this weekend, aids campus and
community charities. Probably
the most important recipient of the
drive is the Dimes for Diplomas,
aiding more students to receive
their University degrees.
Besides the diploma fund, which
receives 30 per cent of all the mon
ey collected, the Palo Alto-Stan
ford War Chest receives 30 per cent
and the World Student Service
Fund, 25 per cent. The March of
Dimes will receive 10 per cent of
the campus collection and 5 per
cent will be placcd in a floating
fund.
The Stanford quota has been
set at $0,000 and War Board Rep
resentatives in each residence arc
collecting $4 from each student.
"Letters are being sent to off
campus students and booths are be
ing placed in the Cellar and Stu
dent Union for the convenience of
these students," Barbara Bonner,
chairman of the drive, has an
nounced.
OfT-campus chairmen arc Twink
Davics and Angie Griffiths. Wom
an's coordinator for living units
is Jcancttc Grimsley, while Bill
Ohlandt is handling the men's
halls.
As yet, a very small percentage
of men's halls have reported their
results to Mitzi Gates, who is keep
ing office hours this week in the
War Board office.
"All living units who have not
reported their results to me must
do so as soon as possible," Miss
Gates said. "It is important that
we find out how much money is
being collected on campus for the
War Fund and (hat War Board
Representatives make »a report
and turn their collection enve
lopes into me," she continued.
Roble girls have signed up to

old members: Patty Whittemore,
women's head; Eugene Mitguard,
men's head; Julie Crommelin; and
Mary Jane Clatworthy. They were
approved by Cardinals in its meet

Excom also approved a budget of
$19.1.50 for Rally Com. The money
will go toward getting needed sup

tively planned for fall quarter, he
said, but the real work of the pres

where it applies to Farm traditions.

An Excom-appointed Reg Day
Procedures Committee, staffed by
Crane Honeysett, Loraine Streblow,
and Gloria Anderson, reported on
proposed methods to improve com

made by the committee were to
have a separate day for freshman
registration, to move the place
where frosh pictures are taken, to
change the women's gym set-up on
Reg Day, and to have Reg books
turned in some other place than the
Administration Building.
The committee will make further
reports and suggestions at later
meetings.
It was proposed that some list
of students interested in activities
be made, to facilitate the appoint
ing of committees, and to assure all
those interested a chance to work
on student committees. ASSU Presi

resentative to bring a list of not
more than 15 names of students
from their respective areas to the
next Excom meeting.
Frank de Lisle , appointed last
week to investigate the organiza

them in closer touch with student
government.

Excom also approved a budget of
$19.1.50 for Rally Com. The money
will go toward getting needed sup
plies for Rally Com to use for com
mittee function, explained jMit
guard. Two rallies have been tenta
tively planned for fall quarter, he
said, but the real work of the pres
ent committee will be to set the
committee work in motion, and re
vive Stanford spirit—particularly
where it applies to Farm traditions.
Fred Bremenkamp announced
that with the cooperation of the ad
ministration and students, the Un

An Excom-appointed Reg Day
Procedures Committee, staffed by
Crane Honeysett, Loraine Streblow,
and Gloria Anderson, reported on
proposed methods to improve com
ing Reg Days. Among suggestions
made by the committee were to
have a separate day for freshman
registration, to move the place
where frosh pictures are taken, to
change the women's gym set-up on
Reg Day, and to have Reg books
turned in some other place than the
Administration Building.
The committee will make further
reports and suggestions at later
meetings.
It was proposed that some list
of students interested in activities
be made, to facilitate the appoint
ing of committees, and to assure all
those interested a chance to work
on student committees. ASSU Presi
dent Bob Kennedy asked each rep
resentative to bring a list of not
more than 15 names of students
from their respective areas to the
next Excom meeting.
Frank de Lisle , appointed last
week to investigate the organiza
tion of a Men's Interhall Excom
similar to the women's Row Excom,
reported his findings. He stated that
hall men arc interested in organiz
ing an excom primarily to bring
them in closer touch with student
government.


ONE OF STANFORD'S football traditions is the gigantic bonfire built
in the dry bed of Lake Lagunita following the Big Game Rally. The

Stanford was far below the war
fund quota today, Barbara Bon
ner, drive chairman stated. "We
have only had $1,340 collected to
wards the $6,000 Farm quota.
"Only four halls have gone above
the 50 per cent mark," Miss Bonner
added, "and the drive ends in two
more days."
Roble 2-C took the lead in the
week-long war fund drive as the
Roble corridor soared their total
to !M per cent. Far ahead of other
Roble units reporting, 2-C was
only 9 per ccnt away from be
coming the first living group to
collect 100 per ccnt.
Storey House leads the Row dis
trict reporting 75 per cent, while
Pierce Hall leads the men's division
with 59 per cent of their collection
being reported.
The war fund drive, which ends
this weekend, aids campus and
community charities. Probably
the most important recipient of the
drive is the Dimes for Diplomas,
aiding more students to receive
their University degrees.
Besides the diploma fund, which
receives 30 per cent of all the mon
ey collected, the Palo Alto-Stan
ford War Chest receives 30 per cent
and the World Student Service
Fund, 25 per cent. The March of
Dimes will receive 10 per cent of
the campus collection and 5 per
cent will be placcd in a floating
fund.
The Stanford quota has been
set at $0,000 and War Board Rep
resentatives in each residence arc
collecting $4 from each student.
"Letters are being sent to off
campus students and booths are be
ing placed in the Cellar and Stu
dent Union for the convenience of
these students," Barbara Bonner,
chairman of the drive, has an
nounced.
OfT-campus chairmen arc Twink
Davics and Angie Griffiths. Wom
an's coordinator for living units
is Jcancttc Grimsley, while Bill
Ohlandt is handling the men's
halls.
As yet, a very small percentage
of men's halls have reported their
results to Mitzi Gates, who is keep
ing office hours this week in the
War Board office.
"All living units who have not
reported their results to me must
do so as soon as possible," Miss
Gates said. "It is important that
we find out how much money is
being collected on campus for the
War Fund and (hat War Board
Representatives make »a report
and turn their collection enve
lopes into me," she continued.
Roble girls have signed up to
carry on the off-campus collec

Union and these girls must show
