# Dr. Thomas To Conduct Educational Discussion At American Studies
## Symposium Lecture Will Concern Basic Issues in Progress Theory, Philosophy Behind Progressivism 
### 
The underlying philosophy of progressive education and competing
educational theories will be discussed this afternoon at the American
Studies symposium, by Dr. Lawrence Gregg Thomas, former assistant
director of the CATS and the CCIS, who is returning to the School of
Education as an assistant professor of education. Dr. Thomas said that his

talk will outline what he considers
the two basic issues between educa
tional theories; first, the conception
of progress and how it is measured,
and second, the conception of
knowledge.
Make Argument Clear
There has been much superficial
talk and confusion on the subject,
Dr. Thomas said, and many who call
themselves progressive are not. The
opposite is also true. He will at
tempt to make clear the basis of a
fruitful argument.
Since his special interest is the
philosophy of education, Dr. Thom
as stated that he is glad to be re
turning to teaching. As assistant
director of the military schools, his
position was chiefly administrative.
Military Contributions
"The CATS and CCIS have made
a contribution to the University in
terms of literature and material col
lected which will remain here, in
the training of certain techniques,"
Thomas said. The War Department
has commended the University for
its contribution.
Dr. Thomas received the A.B. and
M.A. degrees at Stanford and the
Ph.D. at Yale. He has taught at the
University of Connecticut one year
and in high schools. He has been
at Stanford since 1939.
