# 'A Highland Fling' To Feature Authentic Plaids of Scotland
## 
### KEN A JEAN BLACK 
Costumes lor the forthcoming
Stanford Players production, "A
Highland Fling," which will open
October 25, 26, 27, arc somo of the
most colorful and appropriate cos
tumes ever planned for a Little
Theater play, according to Mrs.
Muriel Livevsay, costume director
for the Drama Department. The
costumes were designed by Mrs.
Lievsay, but she states that the real
credit for making the clothes should
go to her assistant Paula Kanner,
and to Judy Schrader, and Mary
L. Kenney, students.
The red of scotch plaids will be
the most vibrant note in the play,
and Mrs, Lievsay has carefully toned
it down with the blue and grey
shades of the Scotch angel and
ghost. Most of the male characters
will wear plaid ties, and Dolly Geng,
the little girl, will wear a plaid kilt
with black velvet jacket and cap.
All aprons, caps, and stockings,
were remodeled into Scotch lines
from available wardrobe.

Costume Donated
An authentic costume complete
with Scotch kilts, sword and sporan,
which was given to the wardrobe
by Dr. Marjory Bailey of the Eng
lish Department, will turn the Laird
into a real Scotsman. The name of
the fictitious Laird was changed to
lit the McLean plaid of his kilts.
The Ghost, a McLean ancestor,
will be in the plaid of the Clan,
also, but the plaid will have a grey
foundation. His costume began as
white muslin, which Mrs. Lievsay
and her helpers dyed grey, and
stenciled with the plaid. The
Ghostie's sporan was ingeniously
made out of ply wood, and dyed
mop, to match the authentic leather
and goats hair sporan of the Laird.
Colors Express Mood*
Silly, the village dafty, will ap
pear in tho first act in red stockings
and Scotch dress to match the red
plaid of the Laird, but her party
dress withe last act will show her
as sophisticated, yet girlish, in an

"Adrian" creation made from de
partment properties.
The wife of Robbie, the sinner,
begins the play in a straitlaced ma
roon dress, but her happiness in the
last act is expressed by a dress of
bright blue green, which blends
with Silly's party dress.
Barmaid Wears Red
Alestrina, Robbie's light o' love
barmaid, is shown at first in a
bright red dress and a black apron,
but after Robbie reforms she wears
a sheer blouse, rose bodice, and
striped rose skirt.
The angel costume is Mrs. Liev
say's prize creation. The flowing
angel sleeves and skirt are sheer
blue material, over a silver founda
tion material. The wings are cov
ered with bright silver paper.

a Stanford Players' production, di
rected by Norman Phil brick of the
