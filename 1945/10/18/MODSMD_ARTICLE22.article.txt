WHY NOT TWO-THIRTIES?
While the Women's Conference Committee
ponders the practicability of two o'clock late
leaves, we'd like to ask: why not two-thirties?
Before the war, every coed accepted without
question her quota of two-thirties. Certainly
Stanford women have not grown any younger,
any loss responsible in the last three years;
women on campus in 1945 do not need more
supervision than women in '41.
Leaving the situation as is seems the least
desirable alternative. Five two - o'clocks per
quarter to be used only for trains from the
fit/ is a doubtful compromise, and the rule
among them all that seems most eligible for
breaking.
The present one-thirties are a definite han
dicap. Planning an evening in San Francisco
which hinges on the 11 o'clock train, gulping
down a hamburger in Paly in the half-hour
which remains at the close of campus dances,
or sticking close to home rather than break
up early an excursion with persons not an
swerable to Women's Council are inconven
iences which could be somewhat remedied by
the one-hour extension under question.
Some may believe that two-thirties would
grant only an extra sixty minutes for "tearing
around," sixty minutes which might have been
used in the safety of the living group, hitting
the books, or making up for sleep cut into dur
ing the week.
However, no rules for lock-out hours, dis
regarding the logic of the principles on which
they are based, will be sufficient instruction in
good conduct or effective enough advice to
those who chronically stay up late to warrant
holding back two-thirties for such theories.
In most phases of their life at the University,
Stanford women are treated as adults. We be
lieve they can also be trusted to conduct them
selves "with respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor, and the rights of others," for an
additional hour. And surely women who need
sleep or additional hours with their studying
will find other times to do so, or will not do
so at all.
We are certain Stanford women are suffi
ciently adult to accept the responsibility of
the two-thirty late leaves. We hope the Con
ference committee will agree.—B. M. V.

The present one-thirties are a definite han
dicap. Planning an evening in San Francisco
which hinges on the 11 o'clock train, gulping
down a hamburger in Paly in the half-hour
which remains at the close of campus dances,
or sticking close to home rather than break
up early an excursion with persons not an
swerable to Women's Council are inconven
iences which could be somewhat remedied by
the one-hour extension under question.
Some may believe that two-thirties would
grant only an extra sixty minutes for "tearing
around," sixty minutes which might have been
used in the safety of the living group, hitting
the books, or making up for sleep cut into dur
ing the week.
However, no rules for lock-out hours, dis
regarding the logic of the principles on which
they are based, will be sufficient instruction in
good conduct or effective enough advice to
those who chronically stay up late to warrant
holding back two-thirties for such theories.
In most phases of their life at the University,
Stanford women are treated as adults. We be
lieve they can also be trusted to conduct them
selves "with respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor, and the rights of others," for an
additional hour. And surely women who need
sleep or additional hours with their studying
will find other times to do so, or will not do
so at all.
We are certain Stanford women are suffi
ciently adult to accept the responsibility of
the two-thirty late leaves. We hope the Con
ference committee will agree.—B. M. V.
WHY NOT TWO-THIRTIES?
While the Women's Conference Committee
ponders the practicability of two o'clock late
leaves, we'd like to ask: why not two-thirties?
Before the war, every coed accepted without
question her quota of two-thirties. Certainly
Stanford women have not grown any younger,
any loss responsible in the last three years;
women on campus in 1945 do not need more
supervision than women in '41.
Leaving the situation as is seems the least
desirable alternative. Five two - o'clocks per
quarter to be used only for trains from the
fit/ is a doubtful compromise, and the rule
among them all that seems most eligible for
breaking.
