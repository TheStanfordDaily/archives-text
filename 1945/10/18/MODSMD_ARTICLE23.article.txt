# Bull Session

### Stanley Wilson 
First of all my apologies to Mr. Rosotti, for
the appearance of your name as Mr. Rosetti in
yesterday's column. Anyone with any intelli
gence or Lucky Lager background would know
that your name is Mr. Rositti—l mean Rosotti.
'Now they have me doing it). But this error no
doubt will bring joy to the hearts of the Stanford
Council for the Prevention of Student Drunks.
You see, it was one of the new freshman report
rrs on the proofreading desk who botched the
deal. All of which proves that freshmen don't
frequent such dens of iniquity. Well, anyhow
Now this subject brings me to my next sub
ject of discussion. While attending the recent
Cal Stanford student convention, our delegates
were as professional as any white-haired San
Francisco Conference big-wig. I visited one
session in the city and this small scale perform
ance at Cal was every bit as impressive.
For example: At the S. F. Conference I no
ticed that all the important delegates from the
various countries had a habit of periodically
passing notes to each other on small pieces of
paper. I was impressed. It was so professional.
Not ten minutes after the student conclave at
Cal had begun I noticed several of our es
teemed student leaders passing similar looking
bits of paper to each other. I was mipressed.
It was so professional.
Finally one of the bits of folded paper wound
its way to my end of the table and with nervous
hands I opened it and saw a likeness of a beer
bottle with the words, "What this meeting
needs" written underneath.
Soon the idea caught on and the meeting ad
journed with a minimum of discussion. Like

I said last week—it was such a successful meet
ing, and so professional.
There are two things everyone should read
in this week's Saturday Evening Post which in
reality is the Wednesday Morning Post. Any
how, read the story, "Who Is Kilroy?", a com
mentary about the Army Air Forces' celebrated
man of mystery. At the end of the yarn the
mystery of the personality still is unsolved but
it's worth a laugh.
The other story is entitled "Gransel and Het
tel," by Colonel Stoopnagle. When you finish
this little goodie your eyes will be almost as
much out of focus as they are after two hours
of reading in the Reserve Dark Room —I mean
Book Room. (This could be meant as a subtle
hint to the University Custodian in Charge of
Lights, to get off the dime).
The Cardinals' committee in charge of pub
licity for the Red and White Ball in November
has come forth with a colossal publicity gag.
This evening couples parked in the cactus gar
dens between 9:45 and 10:15 will have an en
velope put on their v/indshield. In two of these
will be free bids to the Ball.
Officer Davis, when asked if parking would
be permitted in the Cactus Gardens, agreed to
allow it, saying: "It's a good idea. I think we
are inclined to be a little too tense these days."
