### Elliot Epsteen 
France today is an interesting and complex
phenomenon. First, it is France arisen from a
defeat, with national pride injured, and there
fore more intense. Second, it is the old schism
between left and right, but now tending to settle
a little. Third, it is in bad economic straits, and
fourth, it is the brilliant, proud and dynamic
figure of General Charles De Gaulle.
The most alarming fact is the economic
straits. Transport is ruined. What the Germans
didn't take in their retreat to the Seigfried Line,
we requisitioned to chase them. There is none
left in good condition, so some places have
food piling up and rotting, while others have
people living on 1500 calories a day. This is
dangerous in any state. The lack of food pro
duces chaos, weakens the governmental fiber,
and finally the people, disgusted with the dan
gerous social system, give their liberties to a
tyrant, no matter how well he disguises him
self.
DE GAULLE
As for the other factors, De Gaulle and nation
al pride are synonomous. The general is a
controversial figure in the sphere of domestic
issues. The fireworks in the Chamber of Depu
ties over constitutional reform proved that. But
he is the symbol of reawakened nationalism.
As such, he holds a post of honor in the heart
of every Frenchman, and, because of that, his
foreign policy is the most important part of his
administration.
Yet foreign policy is two things, the way a
body politic solves its problems, and accom
plishes its ends. The main problem of France
now is to escape domination by the big three.
To solve this, it is playing for more prestige in
the geo-political sense, so as to rise to a position
of equality with them, really turning the ruling
trinity of Europe into a foursome, and, secondly,
in case that foursome splits three-one, France
would like to hold the position of part leader
ship with the three.
FOREIGN POLICY
For this reason, De Gaulle is taking steps
to bring the non-Germanic states of the Rhine in
his discretion and also to get a grip on the
Rhineland and the industrial Ruhr. He might
want to see the Balkans revert to their old posi
tion as an Anglo-French sphere of influence,
with French positional dominance.
De Gaulle is also branching into the Mediter
ranean. His main play is in Spain. Here, he is
playing off the Loyalists and the monarchy
against each other, demanding a seat in the pre
monarchial regency, and, if he can't get that or
get the government under his control in some
way, to develop and support a new revolution.
When the Loyalists return to Spain, one of the
first things they will have to watch out for is
too much French support.
France right now is inhibited from these aims
by the deplorable condition of her economy,
and by the fact that her war potential is not up
to full power, thus leaving her under the discre
tion of the west.
Also, she is internally disorganized, with a
strong schism between right and left. However,
she is showing that she swings left of center,
for a vigorous, centrally controlled national eco
nomic recovery without Marxran extremism.
She should get her wish in a few years, and
then we will find a compact body politic in
western Europe that might easily fill the vac
uum left by these years of war. Soon France,
recovered, strong, and nationalist, will be a
power again, and for that reason it is well to
cultivate her, and to judge her by her future
instead of the lamentable recent past produced
through the ineptness of an archaic genera]
staff.

France today is an interesting and complex
phenomenon. First, it is France arisen from a
defeat, with national pride injured, and there
fore more intense. Second, it is the old schism
between left and right, but now tending to settle
a little. Third, it is in bad economic straits, and
fourth, it is the brilliant, proud and dynamic
figure of General Charles De Gaulle.
The most alarming fact is the economic
straits. Transport is ruined. What the Germans
didn't take in their retreat to the Seigfried Line,
we requisitioned to chase them. There is none
left in good condition, so some places have
food piling up and rotting, while others have
people living on 1500 calories a day. This is
dangerous in any state. The lack of food pro
duces chaos, weakens the governmental fiber,
and finally the people, disgusted with the dan
gerous social system, give their liberties to a
tyrant, no matter how well he disguises him
self.
DE GAULLE
As for the other factors, De Gaulle and nation
al pride are synonomous. The general is a
controversial figure in the sphere of domestic
issues. The fireworks in the Chamber of Depu
ties over constitutional reform proved that. But
he is the symbol of reawakened nationalism.
As such, he holds a post of honor in the heart
of every Frenchman, and, because of that, his
foreign policy is the most important part of his
administration.
Yet foreign policy is two things, the way a
body politic solves its problems, and accom
plishes its ends. The main problem of France
now is to escape domination by the big three.
To solve this, it is playing for more prestige in
the geo-political sense, so as to rise to a position
of equality with them, really turning the ruling
trinity of Europe into a foursome, and, secondly,
in case that foursome splits three-one, France
would like to hold the position of part leader
ship with the three.
FOREIGN POLICY
For this reason, De Gaulle is taking steps
to bring the non-Germanic states of the Rhine in
his discretion and also to get a grip on the
Rhineland and the industrial Ruhr. He might
want to see the Balkans revert to their old posi
tion as an Anglo-French sphere of influence,
with French positional dominance.
De Gaulle is also branching into the Mediter
ranean. His main play is in Spain. Here, he is
playing off the Loyalists and the monarchy
against each other, demanding a seat in the pre
monarchial regency, and, if he can't get that or
get the government under his control in some
way, to develop and support a new revolution.
When the Loyalists return to Spain, one of the
first things they will have to watch out for is
too much French support.
France right now is inhibited from these aims
by the deplorable condition of her economy,
and by the fact that her war potential is not up
to full power, thus leaving her under the discre
tion of the west.
Also, she is internally disorganized, with a
strong schism between right and left. However,
she is showing that she swings left of center,
for a vigorous, centrally controlled national eco
nomic recovery without Marxran extremism.
She should get her wish in a few years, and
then we will find a compact body politic in
western Europe that might easily fill the vac
uum left by these years of war. Soon France,
recovered, strong, and nationalist, will be a
power again, and for that reason it is well to
cultivate her, and to judge her by her future
instead of the lamentable recent past produced
through the ineptness of an archaic genera]
staff.
