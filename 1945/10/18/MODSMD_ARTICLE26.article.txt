# Come join the Hand--In Japan
## Lt. Bowie, '31, Hears Song at V-J Landing 
### 
Stanford's own marching song,
"Come, Join the Band," was the first
song Navy Lieutenant Kenneth L.
Bowmon, '31, heard when he landed
on Japan V-J Day.
"As beachmaster for the U.S.S.
Talladega, first APA (assault trans
port) to dock in Yokohama, I had
just started unloading troops over a
breakwater from landing craft when
I heard the unmistakable strains of
'Come, Join the Band'," Lieutenant
Bowen wrote his wife, who lives in
Redwood City.
"Startled and almost unwilling to
believe my ears, I turned around
and there, about fifty yards iway
in front of the harbor master's of
fice, was an Army band giving out
for all it was worth. Believe me, I
was as thrilled as a kid at his first
circus. Here I was, a third of the
way around the world, in what had
just been enemy country, and hear
ing a Stanford song. You can imag
ine my feelings!"
Bowen went on to say that he
made it a point to talk to the band
leader, Master Sergeant John F.
Krauss, and learned that he was
from the llfh Airborne Division and
had been flown into Japan in C-54
transports.
"From a flag raising, v hich T saw
shortly after setting foot on Japa
nese soil, until the fading into the
darkness of Mt. Fujiyama as we left
Japan, about 56 hours later, I had a
great experience," he wrote.
Bowen expects to be home soon,
since he has almost the necessary
number of points for a discharge.
