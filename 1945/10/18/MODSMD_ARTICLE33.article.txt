# N.R.O.T.C. Officer Describes Program
## Capt. Crombe Tells Opportunities Offered in Recreation, Education 
### 
"With the idea to make Navy men part of the Stanford family and to
fit them for their work in the Navy, the peacetime N.R.O.T.C. at Stan
ford has been established," commented Commdr. John L. Wilfong, in
expressing his views of the program.
The 200 men here are encouraged to take part in extra-curricular ac-

tivities and are not to be considered 4
a separate unit, this officer believes.
Navy men already are taking part
in such activities as the Gaieties,
the band, and especially in athletics.
Informality Stressed
Although there are required naval |
science subjects, study hours and
two hours of drill per week, in- 1
formality with the minimum of mili- j
tary requirements is the keynote of i
the Navy program here, Wilfong i
stated.
The Navy is now highly special- j
ized and junior officers, which these
graduates will be, are required to
have much specialized knowledge,
said Capt. C. E. Crombe, Jr., an
other officer in the program. The
V-12 Navy program is discontin
ued, and N.R.O.T.C. is taking its j
place in the postwar program.
Men Choose Majors
These men are allowed to choose
their own majors and to budget i
their time as much as possible, but
are required to take 17 units.
That Toyon will probably be the
permanent barracks was the belief
of Captain Crombe, for it is now
leased by the government and has
its own sick bay and dental unit.
"The unit hopes to become self
sufficient," he said.
Plans for the social and educa
tional aspects are constantly being
made, and the men are planning
formal dances in the Toyon lobby.
Guests and families may be received
in the lobby after study hours and
on Sunday, he explained further.
Cruise Opportunities
Next summer men may possibly
have the opportunity to take prac
tice cruises of two weeks to a
month, when they take an active
part in the sailing of the ships, ac
cording to Capt. Crombe.
When asked his opinion of the
program at Stanford in later post
war years, Captain Crombe said it
would probably be large, as 300
students are planned to be enrolled.

N.R.O.T.C. men have their own
system of companies and company
officers in Toyon. The company offi
cers are chosen from the student
body, and others will be changed
from time to time in order to give
all men this experience.
Selection for Program
These men were selected for their
interest and their scholastic abilities
by the Bureau of Naval Personnel,
which conducted polls in this coun
try and at sea for a long period of
time, Captain Crombe explained.
Fifteen hundred were selected and
divided among ten colleges. The
minimum was high school graduation
standing of a B average. About two
thirds of the men here are high
school graduates and about one
third have had some college train
ing.
"Navy men find the program con
ducive because of the expenses and
the opportunity to come to Stan
ford," he said. These men now are
in the USN, and when graduated
will be commissioned ensigns in the
USNR.
Officers Teach
In the administrative end of the
program 11 officers who also teach
naval science courses. A medical
officer and line officer, who will leach
navigation, are to be added to the
program soon.
Captain Crombe has had extensive
sea duty throughout the war, both
on the Chicago and the Cleveland.
He was with the Chicago at sea on
December 7, 1941. and was with it
until it was sunk in 1943. From
Guadalcanal he went through the
Solomons campaign on the Cleve
land. Until coming to Stanford he
was with the staff of the commanding
chief of the Atlantic Fleet, he was
graduated from the Naval Academy
in 1926.
