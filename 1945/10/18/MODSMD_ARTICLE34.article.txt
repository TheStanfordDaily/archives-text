# Hasher Squad Meets Fillies
## 
### 
The Kappa-Dee Gee Hashers and
the BBC Fills occupy the intra
mural league spotlight tomorrow as
they collide in a contest that should
determine the champion of League
I. Both clubs have won their first
three tilts in a convincing manner
and have shown strong offensive
power.
The Kappa-Dee Gees, who have
rolled up 76 points in three games
to their opponents' 12, would be
favored except for the fact that
varsity sports have wreaked hav
oc with their starting line-up, and
their personnel for tomorrow's
tussle is uncertain. In the regular
first string performs, Joe Sher will
handle the passing chores with
halfback Willie Davies and ends
Ed Luce and Ric Supple on the
receiving end. The Kappa-Dee
Gees have utilized Sher's brilliant
passing ability as the main spark
plug of their offense to date.
The BBC Fills, with 62 points in
three contests as against 20 for their
opponents, will place the brunt of
their offense on the shoulders of
halfback Jack Woods, who is tied
for the individual scoring lead in
intramural play with 24 points.
Woods will be aided by halfback
Pete Brown and end Bernie Camp
bell, who have each contributed
two touchdowns to the Fills' rec
ord .
Medics Meet Encina 111
In another top League I struggle,
Medics A, who looked impressive
in walloping Van Buren, 47-0, on
Tuesday, face Encina 111. The En
emas who have a 2-1 record, suffered
their initial loss to the Kappa-Dee
Gees by a 22-6 count last week. The
Medics' lone defeat to date was also
at the hands of the Kappa-Dee Gees.
The third League I game pits the
Chinese Club against Van Buren.
Both teams have lost twice and are
trying for their first win.
League II Contests
In League 11, the high-flying Hill
toppers engage a weak Encina I
team, while Encina 11, tied with the
Hilltoppers for first place, meets a
slightly tougher opponent in once
beaten Jefferson. Cleveland, which
won a surprise 19-7 victory from
the Firehouse on Tuesday, battles
an unvictorious Jackson sextet in
the third contest. Jackson has lost
five of their first-stringers to vars
ity football and may be unable to
field a team.
The most outstanding of these
three games should be the Encina
11-Jefferson battle. Encina faced
rather weak clubs in their first two
outings and may find Jefferson a
much tougher nut to crack. The
Hilltoppers, who have piled up 77
points in two games while holding
their opponents scoreless, should
have little trouble keeping their slate
clean. Their attack will be paced
by halfback Ernie Webb, who is
tied with Woods of the BBC Fills
at the top of the individual scoring
column.
In the helter-Skelter League
111 race, the strong Army outfit
and Medics 111 hold top positions
al the present time with one win
and no defeats, and both should
keep their unbeaten records in
tact in tomorrow's games. The
Army, fresh from a 32-6 victory
over Phi Psi, meets the cellar
dwelling Hayes sextet, while the
Medics battle the sixth-place Taft
team. The Medics won their first
league tilt Tuesday when they
downed strong Buchanan, 115-7.
Phi Psis vs. Buchanan
The most closely-matched of the
League II tussles brings together the
Phi Psis and Buchanan, who both
incurred their first defeat on Tues
day. The Phi Psis, rated high on
pre-season dope sheets, have lost
such stars as Bob Abrams, Tom
Ashley, and Tom Hood to varsity
sports and are much weaker at this

point. However, they are still a
dangerous team and will provide
tough competition for Buchanan's
big sextet, which was also ranked
high before the season opened.
Neither team can definitely be
counted out of the running yet, and
tomorrow's contest should prove
close and interesting.
Coach Elwyn Bugge, director of
the intramural program, urges that
all team managers report promptly
at 4:15 to obtain equipment in order
that the games may begin on sched
ule at 4:30. Mr. Bugge also re
marked that any teams who are un
able to play on their scheuled date
should arrange in advance with
him for a postponement.—Gilkey.

to their opponents' 12, would be
favored except for the fact that
varsity sports have wreaked hav

their personnel for tomorrow's
tussle is uncertain. In the regular
first string performs, Joe Sher will
handle the passing chores with
halfback Willie Davies and ends
Ed Luce and Ric Supple on the
receiving end. The Kappa-Dee
Gees have utilized Sher's brilliant
passing ability as the main spark
plug of their offense to date.
The BBC Fills, with 62 points in
three contests as against 20 for their
opponents, will place the brunt of
their offense on the shoulders of
halfback Jack Woods, who is tied
for the individual scoring lead in
intramural play with 24 points.
Woods will be aided by halfback
Pete Brown and end Bernie Camp

Medics Meet Encina 111
In another top League I struggle,
Medics A, who looked impressive
in walloping Van Buren, 47-0, on
Tuesday, face Encina 111. The En
emas who have a 2-1 record, suffered
their initial loss to the Kappa-Dee
Gees by a 22-6 count last week. The
Medics' lone defeat to date was also
at the hands of the Kappa-Dee Gees.
The third League I game pits the
Chinese Club against Van Buren.
Both teams have lost twice and are
trying for their first win.
League II Contests
In League 11, the high-flying Hill
toppers engage a weak Encina I
team, while Encina 11, tied with the
Hilltoppers for first place, meets a
slightly tougher opponent in once
beaten Jefferson. Cleveland, which
won a surprise 19-7 victory from
the Firehouse on Tuesday, battles
an unvictorious Jackson sextet in
the third contest. Jackson has lost
five of their first-stringers to vars
ity football and may be unable to
field a team.
The most outstanding of these
three games should be the Encina
11-Jefferson battle. Encina faced
rather weak clubs in their first two
outings and may find Jefferson a
much tougher nut to crack. The
Hilltoppers, who have piled up 77
points in two games while holding
their opponents scoreless, should
have little trouble keeping their slate
clean. Their attack will be paced
by halfback Ernie Webb, who is
tied with Woods of the BBC Fills
at the top of the individual scoring
column.
In the helter-Skelter League
111 race, the strong Army outfit
and Medics 111 hold top positions
al the present time with one win
and no defeats, and both should
keep their unbeaten records in
tact in tomorrow's games. The
Army, fresh from a 32-6 victory
over Phi Psi, meets the cellar
dwelling Hayes sextet, while the
Medics battle the sixth-place Taft
team. The Medics won their first
league tilt Tuesday when they
downed strong Buchanan, 115-7.
Phi Psis vs. Buchanan
The most closely-matched of the
League II tussles brings together the
Phi Psis and Buchanan, who both
incurred their first defeat on Tues
day. The Phi Psis, rated high on
pre-season dope sheets, have lost
such stars as Bob Abrams, Tom
Ashley, and Tom Hood to varsity
sports and are much weaker at this

point. However, they are still a
dangerous team and will provide
tough competition for Buchanan's
big sextet, which was also ranked
high before the season opened.
Neither team can definitely be
counted out of the running yet, and
tomorrow's contest should prove
close and interesting.
Coach Elwyn Bugge, director of
the intramural program, urges that
all team managers report promptly
at 4:15 to obtain equipment in order
that the games may begin on sched
ule at 4:30. Mr. Bugge also re
marked that any teams who are un
able to play on their scheuled date
should arrange in advance with
him for a postponement.—Gilkey.
The Kappa-Dee Gee Hashers and
the BBC Fills occupy the intra
mural league spotlight tomorrow as
they collide in a contest that should
determine the champion of League
I. Both clubs have won their first
three tilts in a convincing manner
and have shown strong offensive
power.

receiving end. The Kappa-Dee
Gees have utilized Sher's brilliant
passing ability as the main spark
plug of their offense to date.
The BBC Fills, with 62 points in
three contests as against 20 for their
opponents, will place the brunt of
their offense on the shoulders of
halfback Jack Woods, who is tied
for the individual scoring lead in
intramural play with 24 points.
Woods will be aided by halfback
Pete Brown and end Bernie Camp
bell, who have each contributed
two touchdowns to the Fills' rec
ord .
Medics Meet Encina 111
In another top League I struggle,
Medics A, who looked impressive
in walloping Van Buren, 47-0, on
Tuesday, face Encina 111. The En
emas who have a 2-1 record, suffered
their initial loss to the Kappa-Dee
Gees by a 22-6 count last week. The
Medics' lone defeat to date was also
at the hands of the Kappa-Dee Gees.
The third League I game pits the
Chinese Club against Van Buren.
Both teams have lost twice and are
trying for their first win.
League II Contests
In League 11, the high-flying Hill
toppers engage a weak Encina I
team, while Encina 11, tied with the
Hilltoppers for first place, meets a
slightly tougher opponent in once
beaten Jefferson. Cleveland, which
won a surprise 19-7 victory from
the Firehouse on Tuesday, battles
an unvictorious Jackson sextet in
the third contest. Jackson has lost
five of their first-stringers to vars
ity football and may be unable to
field a team.
The most outstanding of these
three games should be the Encina
11-Jefferson battle. Encina faced
rather weak clubs in their first two
outings and may find Jefferson a
much tougher nut to crack. The
Hilltoppers, who have piled up 77
points in two games while holding
their opponents scoreless, should
have little trouble keeping their slate
clean. Their attack will be paced
by halfback Ernie Webb, who is
tied with Woods of the BBC Fills
at the top of the individual scoring
column.
In the helter-Skelter League
111 race, the strong Army outfit
and Medics 111 hold top positions
al the present time with one win
and no defeats, and both should
keep their unbeaten records in
tact in tomorrow's games. The
Army, fresh from a 32-6 victory
over Phi Psi, meets the cellar
dwelling Hayes sextet, while the
Medics battle the sixth-place Taft
team. The Medics won their first
league tilt Tuesday when they
downed strong Buchanan, 115-7.
Phi Psis vs. Buchanan
The most closely-matched of the
League II tussles brings together the
Phi Psis and Buchanan, who both
incurred their first defeat on Tues
day. The Phi Psis, rated high on
pre-season dope sheets, have lost
such stars as Bob Abrams, Tom
Ashley, and Tom Hood to varsity
sports and are much weaker at this

point. However, they are still a
dangerous team and will provide
tough competition for Buchanan's
big sextet, which was also ranked
high before the season opened.
Neither team can definitely be
counted out of the running yet, and
tomorrow's contest should prove
close and interesting.
Coach Elwyn Bugge, director of
the intramural program, urges that
all team managers report promptly
at 4:15 to obtain equipment in order
that the games may begin on sched
ule at 4:30. Mr. Bugge also re
marked that any teams who are un
able to play on their scheuled date
should arrange in advance with
him for a postponement.—Gilkey.
The Kappa-Dee Gee Hashers and
the BBC Fills occupy the intra
mural league spotlight tomorrow as
they collide in a contest that should
determine the champion of League
I. Both clubs have won their first
three tilts in a convincing manner
and have shown strong offensive
power.
The Kappa-Dee Gees, who have
rolled up 76 points in three games
to their opponents' 12, would be
favored except for the fact that
varsity sports have wreaked hav
oc with their starting line-up, and
their personnel for tomorrow's
tussle is uncertain. In the regular
first string performs, Joe Sher will
handle the passing chores with
halfback Willie Davies and ends
Ed Luce and Ric Supple on the
receiving end. The Kappa-Dee
Gees have utilized Sher's brilliant
passing ability as the main spark
plug of their offense to date.
The BBC Fills, with 62 points in
