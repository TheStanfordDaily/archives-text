# The 						Stanford Daily

### Bob Slobe 
Numerous bits of constructive criticism have recently been
voiced to the effect that the Daily sports page does not print
enough material about campus sports â€”in other words too much
material which is of no consequence to Stanford students is ap
pearing on the sports page.
Criticism Appreciated
In answer to this criticism, I need only say that the Daily
sports staff is undermanned, and it is necessary at times to make
use of such unconsequential material as we can lay our hands
on. We are, however, gratified that some people are interested
enough to read the page with enough interest to form critical
opinions.
In this writing I will attempt to give you new Stanfordites
a brief (?) summary of the past year and one-half of intra-mural
activities and thus get a little more campusy in my "slants."
' Boozers" Tops in Mural Softball
The softball world had been well controlled by the Monroe
"Boozers" since the summer of 1944. That quarter they lost
only one game to the Firehouse and the flawless chucking of
Bob Rosburg kept the opposing tens starving for hits. Last
spring quarter, behind the professional twirling of Joe Sher,
Monroe again copped the crown with a record marred only by
their 2-1 loss to the Tyler "Hilltoppers." With the million-dollar
infield consisting of Bob Rosburg, Dave Grey, Ric Supple, and
Ed Luce there was never any doubt which team would come
out on top.
There were other stars, however, such as Luke Pitts, and
Tom Ashley of the Phi Psis and Joe Pickering and Denny Fox
of Tyler, who really could play ball.
Toyon Squad Lead Gridsters
With the advent of the 1944 mural football season, little was
known about the comparative strength of the many teams that
entered competition. A group of Toyon gridsters calling them
selves the Arguello Athletic Association were soon to show
the other squads how the game was played. Their backfield
consisted of Jim Bradshaw, son of "Rabbit" Bradshaw, frosh
coach a few years back; Gordon Levy, track star from Fresno,
and Dick Jennings, who was a 10.5 man in the 100. The line
was made up of Bob Abrams, big Morley Thompson, and little
Joe Pickering, who only weighed 189 pounds with his clothes on.
They lost one game to Gerona AC (alternating current) to
the tune of 14-13 and went on to cop the combined league cham
pionship by overwhelming Co. C.
Legal Casabans Good
After basketball season was over, many Stanford sports ad
dicts were really sorry that the Indians did not put a quintet
on the hardwoods last year. The mural top honors were copped
by the "well oiled" Leagle Eagle machine, as some sports
writer so aptly put it, as they went on to cop the combined league
crown after losing their first game to the "Hilltoppers" 32-30.
The backboard control of Hartwell and Husby along with the
ruggedness of Keller and the support of Walt, Eymann and
Danaher was too much for the rest of the teams. Top scoring
honors went to hot shot "Red" Prescott of the AST Cougars.
The thrill a minute honors went to the Phi Psi trio of Pitts,
Hood, and Ashley. They racked up points by the score when
they got "hot," and lost a number of close games.
This story will be concluded next Tuesday with a list of
the all star teams and a brief history of the Palo Alto Inde
pendent teams.
