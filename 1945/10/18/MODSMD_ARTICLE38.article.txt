# Albert To Lead Pre-Flighters
## 
### 
MORAGA, Oct. 17 (UP). —St.
Mary's Pie-Flight Airdevils will be
stripped of their professional foot
ball talent when they travel to Los
Angeles to meet U.C.L.A. Friday
night—but they still figure they
have a good chance to upset the
Bruins.
With Frankie Albert, the Stan
ford Ail-American, in the T slot,
the others in the backfield will be
Ernie Johnson at left half, Chuck
Harrington at right half, and Dick
Liebert at full.
