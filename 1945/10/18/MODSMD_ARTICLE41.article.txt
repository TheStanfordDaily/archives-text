EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 17 (UP).—
The University of Oregon was de
prived of a first-string fullback and
a promising halfback today when
the Byers brothers, Jim and Bill,
withdrew from the university be
cause of a critical housing shortage
near the campus. Their departure

was a serious blow to the Webfoot
squad.
Meanwhile the Webfeet worked
out in the sunshine today following
extensive experience with wet ball
handling yesterday. Jake Leicht
saw his first rugged action drill of
the week and his shoulder injury
was apparently fully recovered.
