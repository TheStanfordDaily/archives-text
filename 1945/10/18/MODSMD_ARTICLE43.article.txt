# Dean Throws Basket ball Practice Into High Gear
## 
### 
In the middle of the third week of
practice, Coach Everett Dean is
not happy. There are very few
"naturals" out, and those boys who
are really trying hard are sadly
lacking in fundamentals. The Farm's
melon mentor, however, has turned
out good teams in the past with
no individuals, and he can easily
do it again!
The daily workout consists of six
laps around the field, some lessons
in ball-handling, and short scrim
mages.
To be* well-coached, basketball,
more than any other sport, re
quires individual training, so it's
necessary to lay off those men
who would not be benefiting the
team with their presence. There
have been no cuts to date, but
Monday will find many solemn
faces around the casaha court.
The coach says he'll be able to
keep fifteen out of the thirty men

that are regularly showing up.
This number is so few because ten
Navy men are to be included in
the squad. A scarcity of coaches
makes it impossible to have a
junior varsity or a frosh squad.
