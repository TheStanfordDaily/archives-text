# History of Student Publications Traced from Founding to Today
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
For many of us the Stanford of
yesterday lives in the words and
pictures of the student publications,
official and otherwise, which have
flourished since the founding of the
University, and the Stanford of to
day will live tomorrow in the words
and pictures ol the campus efforts
today—the Daily, the Quad, the
Chaparral.
During the years since Stanford
was founded, student literary pub
lications have come and gone, some
with amazing rapidity, and some
have stayed to become a permanent
part of Stanford life. Bound vol
umes of all may be read in the
Timothy Hopkins room between the
reference and periodical rooms in
the Stanford Library.
DAILY IS OLDEST
The first publications apparently
have the most staying power. The
Daily leads in age, having been
published continuously since Oc
tober, 1891, the day the University
opened. Published "for, with, of, to,
and by the students," the Daily Palo

Alto, or "Dippy," began as a four
column sheet and with the years
grew to eight columns.
A temporary shrinkage in size
during the recent war has been
done away with and the paper is
now back to the normal size and
regular coverage of campus and na
tional events.
SEQUOIA—IB9I-191!)
The second publication founded
was the Sequoia, on December 9,
1891, which appeared monthly for
28 years. Sequoia contained essays
by professors and students, sections
on organizations, athletics, news
notes, historical material on the
University and the faculty, and,
later, various forms of creative
writing.
W. Nicholson, editor - in - chief,
with twelve assistants, said in the
opening editorial that the Sequoia
"appeared in answer to the general
demand of the student body and the
usefulness of its mission will be in
direct ratio to the earnestness of
that demand. . . . The aim should
be to represent the highest intent
of the University and we take it
that the highest intent of the insti
tution is the composite of the highest
interest of her individual members.
. . . Each and every one feeling a
personal interest and joint owner
ship in the advancement of Leland
Stanford Junior University will al
ways have something to say, and the
columns of the Sequoia are his."
CHANGES MADE
"Radical changes" took place in
1907. The March issue of that year
contained "The Political Machine in
Encina Hall," "Love Letters of a Co
ed," both with illustrations, and an
editorial which announced:
"To the charge of radicalism we
plead guilty, if by radicalism is
meant the making of any change.
. . . The student body didn't care
for the sheet last year and wouldn't
buy it. . . . We cut out the senti
mental stories and crude English 8
themes that had formerly composed
the entire makeup of the magazine
and we filled it with well-written
articles on lively subjects. . . . Now
we maintain that the purpose of the
college magazine is to please the
college public, to represent its
many-sided interests and to give
voice to its sentiments."
MONEY TROUBLE
When Sequoia expired in 1919 be
cause of financial difficulties, the
plague of liteary magazines, it was
revived in October of 1921 by the
Stanford Cardinal. First article in
the Cardinal was a history by Axxhie

Binne. It also ceased publication in
1923.
Next to appear on Quad was the
Stanford Spectator in 1924, which
was published by the Press and
English clubs. It included plays,
poems, pictures, notes on sports and
events, and lasted a year. John
Steinbeck was a student at that time
and contributed some stories and
poems.
A "LITTLE MAGAZINE"
A "little magazine," the Stanford
Lit, came out from December 1925
to June 1929. The Lit "does hope
to be intelligent without being in
tellectual, to be amusing without
being slapstick, and to be sincere
without being bigoted . . said the
editor, E. R. Smith. "Its pages will
contain the best in its field that
Stanford has to give and it should
take its place among the foremost
collegiate literary publications."
A literary aim was also expressed
by Gunnar Norberg, editor of the
College Forum, which first appeai'ed
surreptitiously on February 24, 1931.
The Forum was to have been pub
lished under the name of the Stan
ford Monthly, but was baved from
official sanction by R. E. Swain, Act
ing President of the University, for
reasons which he stated in the Daily
were chiefly financial.
"WRITERS NEED OUTLET"
Norberg said in the opening edi
torial that "There are in most col
leges and universities, students who
will sooner or later make names for
themselves as writers of one kind
or another. These student writers
have at the moment no medium in
which adequately to express them
selves."
Denied official status, the Forum
welcomed contributions from other
colleges, included articles on timely
subjects, interviews, verse, views
on athletics and drinking, reviews of
plays and books and some original
stories.
"UNIQUE HISTORY"
Second only to the Daily in age,
the Stanford Quad, from 1894 to
1945, has recorded the history of
the Stanford Family—"a happy re
membrance of the peculiar and
unique incidents of years at Stan
ford," the rst editor, A. Lewis, Jr.,
called Quad.
The first Quads had a few photo
graphs, names and statistics, but
prize poetry and stories occupied
most of the book. The literary sec
tion was dropped in about ten years,
but revived in 1910 with several ar
ticles by alumni. It was then
dropped again and from that time
the trend has been toward more art
and less writing.
ART IN QUAD
The comic section was an indis
pensable part of Quad evidently
until 1939, and since then candid
photographs about campus and
"atry" shots have made a record of
Farm life with the emphasis on
outstanding figures and events.
The laughs in student life have
for the most part been supplied by
Hammer and Coffin's little rag
(mag) the "Chappie." Chaparral
first came out October 5, 1899, with

Bristow Adams us founder and Chris
Bradley as the first Old Boy.
Establishment of Hammer and
Coffin in April 1906 was immedi
ately followed by the San Fran
cisco earthquake.
CHAPPIE S RECORD
Chappie has been issued intermit
tently (396 issues in 45 years) by
Hammer and Coffin members who,
in the words of Chappie's own Hen
rietta Nussbaum, have become
"famed and distinguished citizens
of the world of art and letters."
One issue of Chappie during
World War I was made up entirely
of contributions by Stanford men
overseas.
Just before Chappie's famous cap
and bells and "Now That's" became
well known on Quad, another small
humor magazine called "Josh" had
been published co-operatively by
Stanford and California in San
Francisco from 1896 to 1897.
UNOFFICIAL "NEWS"
Among the unofficial publications
during the '30's was the News, a five
cent magazine published by Dick
Sprouse with fourteen editors. In
an editorial in October 1934, the
News said: "No one knew what the
News was trying to do last year
and this year no one does either.
When pressed, News admits it is a
combination Time and New Yorker
—localized. News is objective, lib
eral, spicy and conceited. The
founding fathers considered the then
existing publications lousy. . . .
They wanted a periodical free to
publish anything; to question the
authority of student, faculty, admin
istration leadership; to show Stan
ford to itself without the usual
rose-colored glasses."
The News included interviews of
professors, comment similar to that
of Time on local events, and reviews
of books, plays and music. It con
tinued selling on Quad for seven is
sues; then was discontinued.
ENGLISH YEARBOOK
From 1930 to 1937 the English
Club issued a mimeographed Year
book of Stanford Writing. Its edi
tors said that they hoped "to pre
sent a clinical record, if not more,
of the current literary effort."
Since that time the outlets for
student writing have been greatly
narrowed. Quad is chiefly a record
of names and faces; Chaparral is a
strictly humorous magazine; and the
Daily is a newspaper.
For many of us the Stanford of
yesterday lives in the words and
pictures of the student publications,
official and otherwise, which have

The comic section was an indis

until 1939, and since then candid
photographs about campus and
"atry" shots have made a record of
Farm life with the emphasis on

The laughs in student life have
for the most part been supplied by
Hammer and Coffin's little rag
(mag) the "Chappie." Chaparral
first came out October 5, 1899, with

Bristow Adams us founder and Chris
Bradley as the first Old Boy.
Establishment of Hammer and
Coffin in April 1906 was immedi

CHAPPIE S RECORD
Chappie has been issued intermit
tently (396 issues in 45 years) by
Hammer and Coffin members who,
in the words of Chappie's own Hen
rietta Nussbaum, have become
"famed and distinguished citizens
of the world of art and letters."
One issue of Chappie during
World War I was made up entirely
of contributions by Stanford men
overseas.
Just before Chappie's famous cap
and bells and "Now That's" became
well known on Quad, another small
humor magazine called "Josh" had
been published co-operatively by
Stanford and California in San
Francisco from 1896 to 1897.
UNOFFICIAL "NEWS"
Among the unofficial publications
during the '30's was the News, a five

Sprouse with fourteen editors. In
an editorial in October 1934, the
News said: "No one knew what the
News was trying to do last year

They wanted a periodical free to

rose-colored glasses."
The News included interviews of
professors, comment similar to that
of Time on local events, and reviews
of books, plays and music. It con
tinued selling on Quad for seven is
sues; then was discontinued.
ENGLISH YEARBOOK
From 1930 to 1937 the English
Club issued a mimeographed Year
book of Stanford Writing. Its edi
tors said that they hoped "to pre
sent a clinical record, if not more,
of the current literary effort."
Since that time the outlets for
student writing have been greatly
narrowed. Quad is chiefly a record
of names and faces; Chaparral is a
strictly humorous magazine; and the
Daily is a newspaper.
For many of us the Stanford of
yesterday lives in the words and
pictures of the student publications,
official and otherwise, which have
flourished since the founding of the
University, and the Stanford of to
day will live tomorrow in the words
and pictures ol the campus efforts
today—the Daily, the Quad, the
Chaparral.
During the years since Stanford
was founded, student literary pub
lications have come and gone, some
with amazing rapidity, and some
have stayed to become a permanent
part of Stanford life. Bound vol
umes of all may be read in the
Timothy Hopkins room between the
reference and periodical rooms in
the Stanford Library.
DAILY IS OLDEST
The first publications apparently
have the most staying power. The
Daily leads in age, having been
published continuously since Oc
tober, 1891, the day the University
opened. Published "for, with, of, to,
and by the students," the Daily Palo

Alto, or "Dippy," began as a four
column sheet and with the years
grew to eight columns.
A temporary shrinkage in size
during the recent war has been
done away with and the paper is
now back to the normal size and
regular coverage of campus and na
tional events.
SEQUOIA—IB9I-191!)
The second publication founded
was the Sequoia, on December 9,
1891, which appeared monthly for
28 years. Sequoia contained essays
by professors and students, sections
on organizations, athletics, news
notes, historical material on the
University and the faculty, and,
later, various forms of creative
writing.
W. Nicholson, editor - in - chief,
with twelve assistants, said in the
opening editorial that the Sequoia
"appeared in answer to the general
demand of the student body and the
usefulness of its mission will be in
direct ratio to the earnestness of
that demand. . . . The aim should
be to represent the highest intent
of the University and we take it
that the highest intent of the insti
tution is the composite of the highest
interest of her individual members.
. . . Each and every one feeling a
personal interest and joint owner
ship in the advancement of Leland
Stanford Junior University will al
ways have something to say, and the
columns of the Sequoia are his."
CHANGES MADE
"Radical changes" took place in
1907. The March issue of that year
contained "The Political Machine in
Encina Hall," "Love Letters of a Co
ed," both with illustrations, and an
editorial which announced:
"To the charge of radicalism we
plead guilty, if by radicalism is
meant the making of any change.
. . . The student body didn't care
for the sheet last year and wouldn't
buy it. . . . We cut out the senti
mental stories and crude English 8
themes that had formerly composed
the entire makeup of the magazine
and we filled it with well-written
articles on lively subjects. . . . Now
we maintain that the purpose of the
college magazine is to please the
college public, to represent its
many-sided interests and to give
voice to its sentiments."
MONEY TROUBLE
When Sequoia expired in 1919 be
cause of financial difficulties, the
plague of liteary magazines, it was
revived in October of 1921 by the
Stanford Cardinal. First article in
the Cardinal was a history by Axxhie

Binne. It also ceased publication in
1923.
Next to appear on Quad was the
Stanford Spectator in 1924, which
was published by the Press and
English clubs. It included plays,
poems, pictures, notes on sports and
events, and lasted a year. John
Steinbeck was a student at that time
and contributed some stories and
poems.
A "LITTLE MAGAZINE"
A "little magazine," the Stanford
Lit, came out from December 1925
to June 1929. The Lit "does hope
to be intelligent without being in
tellectual, to be amusing without
being slapstick, and to be sincere
without being bigoted . . said the
editor, E. R. Smith. "Its pages will
contain the best in its field that
Stanford has to give and it should
take its place among the foremost
collegiate literary publications."
A literary aim was also expressed
by Gunnar Norberg, editor of the
College Forum, which first appeai'ed
surreptitiously on February 24, 1931.
The Forum was to have been pub
lished under the name of the Stan
ford Monthly, but was baved from
official sanction by R. E. Swain, Act
ing President of the University, for
reasons which he stated in the Daily
were chiefly financial.
"WRITERS NEED OUTLET"
Norberg said in the opening edi
torial that "There are in most col
leges and universities, students who
will sooner or later make names for
themselves as writers of one kind
or another. These student writers
have at the moment no medium in
which adequately to express them
selves."
Denied official status, the Forum
welcomed contributions from other
colleges, included articles on timely
subjects, interviews, verse, views
on athletics and drinking, reviews of
plays and books and some original
stories.
"UNIQUE HISTORY"
Second only to the Daily in age,
the Stanford Quad, from 1894 to
1945, has recorded the history of
the Stanford Family—"a happy re
membrance of the peculiar and
unique incidents of years at Stan
ford," the rst editor, A. Lewis, Jr.,
called Quad.
The first Quads had a few photo
graphs, names and statistics, but
prize poetry and stories occupied
most of the book. The literary sec

MONEY TROUBLE
When Sequoia expired in 1919 be
cause of financial difficulties, the
plague of liteary magazines, it was
revived in October of 1921 by the
Stanford Cardinal. First article in
the Cardinal was a history by Axxhie

Binne. It also ceased publication in
1923.
Next to appear on Quad was the
Stanford Spectator in 1924, which
was published by the Press and
English clubs. It included plays,
poems, pictures, notes on sports and
events, and lasted a year. John
Steinbeck was a student at that time
and contributed some stories and
poems.
A "LITTLE MAGAZINE"
A "little magazine," the Stanford
Lit, came out from December 1925
to June 1929. The Lit "does hope
to be intelligent without being in
tellectual, to be amusing without
being slapstick, and to be sincere
without being bigoted . . said the
editor, E. R. Smith. "Its pages will
contain the best in its field that

take its place among the foremost
collegiate literary publications."
A literary aim was also expressed
by Gunnar Norberg, editor of the
College Forum, which first appeai'ed
surreptitiously on February 24, 1931.
The Forum was to have been pub
lished under the name of the Stan
ford Monthly, but was baved from
official sanction by R. E. Swain, Act
ing President of the University, for
reasons which he stated in the Daily
were chiefly financial.
"WRITERS NEED OUTLET"
Norberg said in the opening edi
torial that "There are in most col
leges and universities, students who
will sooner or later make names for
themselves as writers of one kind
or another. These student writers
have at the moment no medium in
which adequately to express them
selves."
Denied official status, the Forum
welcomed contributions from other
colleges, included articles on timely
subjects, interviews, verse, views
on athletics and drinking, reviews of
plays and books and some original
stories.
"UNIQUE HISTORY"
Second only to the Daily in age,
the Stanford Quad, from 1894 to
1945, has recorded the history of
the Stanford Family—"a happy re
membrance of the peculiar and
unique incidents of years at Stan
ford," the rst editor, A. Lewis, Jr.,
called Quad.
The first Quads had a few photo
graphs, names and statistics, but
prize poetry and stories occupied
most of the book. The literary sec
tion was dropped in about ten years,
but revived in 1910 with several ar
ticles by alumni. It was then
dropped again and from that time
the trend has been toward more art
and less writing.
ART IN QUAD
The comic section was an indis
pensable part of Quad evidently
until 1939, and since then candid
photographs about campus and
"atry" shots have made a record of
Farm life with the emphasis on
outstanding figures and events.
The laughs in student life have
for the most part been supplied by
Hammer and Coffin's little rag
(mag) the "Chappie." Chaparral
first came out October 5, 1899, with

Bristow Adams us founder and Chris
Bradley as the first Old Boy.
Establishment of Hammer and
Coffin in April 1906 was immedi
ately followed by the San Fran
cisco earthquake.
CHAPPIE S RECORD
Chappie has been issued intermit
tently (396 issues in 45 years) by
Hammer and Coffin members who,
in the words of Chappie's own Hen
rietta Nussbaum, have become
"famed and distinguished citizens
of the world of art and letters."
One issue of Chappie during
World War I was made up entirely
of contributions by Stanford men
overseas.
Just before Chappie's famous cap
and bells and "Now That's" became
well known on Quad, another small
humor magazine called "Josh" had
been published co-operatively by
Stanford and California in San
Francisco from 1896 to 1897.
UNOFFICIAL "NEWS"
Among the unofficial publications
during the '30's was the News, a five
cent magazine published by Dick
Sprouse with fourteen editors. In
an editorial in October 1934, the
News said: "No one knew what the
News was trying to do last year
and this year no one does either.
When pressed, News admits it is a
combination Time and New Yorker
—localized. News is objective, lib
eral, spicy and conceited. The
founding fathers considered the then
existing publications lousy. . . .
They wanted a periodical free to
publish anything; to question the
authority of student, faculty, admin

ford to itself without the usual
rose-colored glasses."
The News included interviews of
professors, comment similar to that
of Time on local events, and reviews
of books, plays and music. It con
tinued selling on Quad for seven is
sues; then was discontinued.
ENGLISH YEARBOOK
From 1930 to 1937 the English
Club issued a mimeographed Year
book of Stanford Writing. Its edi
tors said that they hoped "to pre
sent a clinical record, if not more,
of the current literary effort."
Since that time the outlets for
student writing have been greatly
narrowed. Quad is chiefly a record
of names and faces; Chaparral is a
strictly humorous magazine; and the
Daily is a newspaper.
For many of us the Stanford of
yesterday lives in the words and
pictures of the student publications,
official and otherwise, which have
flourished since the founding of the
University, and the Stanford of to
day will live tomorrow in the words
and pictures ol the campus efforts
today—the Daily, the Quad, the
Chaparral.
During the years since Stanford
was founded, student literary pub
lications have come and gone, some
with amazing rapidity, and some
have stayed to become a permanent
part of Stanford life. Bound vol
umes of all may be read in the
Timothy Hopkins room between the
reference and periodical rooms in
the Stanford Library.
DAILY IS OLDEST
The first publications apparently
have the most staying power. The
Daily leads in age, having been
published continuously since Oc
tober, 1891, the day the University
opened. Published "for, with, of, to,
and by the students," the Daily Palo

Alto, or "Dippy," began as a four
column sheet and with the years
grew to eight columns.
A temporary shrinkage in size
during the recent war has been
done away with and the paper is
now back to the normal size and
regular coverage of campus and na
tional events.
SEQUOIA—IB9I-191!)
The second publication founded
was the Sequoia, on December 9,
1891, which appeared monthly for
28 years. Sequoia contained essays
by professors and students, sections
on organizations, athletics, news
notes, historical material on the
University and the faculty, and,
later, various forms of creative
writing.
W. Nicholson, editor - in - chief,
with twelve assistants, said in the
opening editorial that the Sequoia
"appeared in answer to the general
demand of the student body and the
usefulness of its mission will be in
direct ratio to the earnestness of
that demand. . . . The aim should
be to represent the highest intent
of the University and we take it
that the highest intent of the insti
tution is the composite of the highest
interest of her individual members.
. . . Each and every one feeling a
personal interest and joint owner
ship in the advancement of Leland
Stanford Junior University will al
ways have something to say, and the
columns of the Sequoia are his."
CHANGES MADE
"Radical changes" took place in
1907. The March issue of that year
contained "The Political Machine in
Encina Hall," "Love Letters of a Co
ed," both with illustrations, and an
editorial which announced:
"To the charge of radicalism we
plead guilty, if by radicalism is
meant the making of any change.
. . . The student body didn't care
for the sheet last year and wouldn't
buy it. . . . We cut out the senti
mental stories and crude English 8
themes that had formerly composed
the entire makeup of the magazine
and we filled it with well-written
articles on lively subjects. . . . Now
we maintain that the purpose of the
college magazine is to please the
college public, to represent its
many-sided interests and to give
voice to its sentiments."

cause of financial difficulties, the
plague of liteary magazines, it was

pictures of the student publications,
official and otherwise, which have
flourished since the founding of the
University, and the Stanford of to
day will live tomorrow in the words
and pictures ol the campus efforts
today—the Daily, the Quad, the
Chaparral.
During the years since Stanford
was founded, student literary pub
lications have come and gone, some
with amazing rapidity, and some
have stayed to become a permanent
part of Stanford life. Bound vol
umes of all may be read in the
Timothy Hopkins room between the
reference and periodical rooms in
the Stanford Library.
DAILY IS OLDEST
The first publications apparently
have the most staying power. The
Daily leads in age, having been
published continuously since Oc
tober, 1891, the day the University
opened. Published "for, with, of, to,
and by the students," the Daily Palo

Alto, or "Dippy," began as a four
column sheet and with the years
grew to eight columns.
A temporary shrinkage in size
during the recent war has been
done away with and the paper is
now back to the normal size and
regular coverage of campus and na
tional events.
SEQUOIA—IB9I-191!)
The second publication founded
was the Sequoia, on December 9,
1891, which appeared monthly for
28 years. Sequoia contained essays
by professors and students, sections
on organizations, athletics, news
notes, historical material on the
University and the faculty, and,
later, various forms of creative
writing.
W. Nicholson, editor - in - chief,
with twelve assistants, said in the
opening editorial that the Sequoia
"appeared in answer to the general
demand of the student body and the
usefulness of its mission will be in
direct ratio to the earnestness of
that demand. . . . The aim should
be to represent the highest intent
of the University and we take it
that the highest intent of the insti
tution is the composite of the highest
interest of her individual members.
. . . Each and every one feeling a
personal interest and joint owner
ship in the advancement of Leland
Stanford Junior University will al
ways have something to say, and the
columns of the Sequoia are his."
CHANGES MADE
"Radical changes" took place in
1907. The March issue of that year
contained "The Political Machine in
Encina Hall," "Love Letters of a Co
ed," both with illustrations, and an
editorial which announced:
"To the charge of radicalism we
plead guilty, if by radicalism is
meant the making of any change.
. . . The student body didn't care
for the sheet last year and wouldn't
buy it. . . . We cut out the senti
mental stories and crude English 8
themes that had formerly composed
the entire makeup of the magazine
and we filled it with well-written
articles on lively subjects. . . . Now
we maintain that the purpose of the
college magazine is to please the
college public, to represent its
many-sided interests and to give
voice to its sentiments."
MONEY TROUBLE
When Sequoia expired in 1919 be
cause of financial difficulties, the
plague of liteary magazines, it was
revived in October of 1921 by the
Stanford Cardinal. First article in
the Cardinal was a history by Axxhie

Binne. It also ceased publication in
1923.
Next to appear on Quad was the
Stanford Spectator in 1924, which
was published by the Press and
English clubs. It included plays,
poems, pictures, notes on sports and
events, and lasted a year. John
Steinbeck was a student at that time
and contributed some stories and
poems.
A "LITTLE MAGAZINE"
A "little magazine," the Stanford
Lit, came out from December 1925
to June 1929. The Lit "does hope
to be intelligent without being in
tellectual, to be amusing without
being slapstick, and to be sincere
without being bigoted . . said the
editor, E. R. Smith. "Its pages will
contain the best in its field that
Stanford has to give and it should
take its place among the foremost
collegiate literary publications."
A literary aim was also expressed
by Gunnar Norberg, editor of the
College Forum, which first appeai'ed
surreptitiously on February 24, 1931.
The Forum was to have been pub
lished under the name of the Stan
ford Monthly, but was baved from
official sanction by R. E. Swain, Act
ing President of the University, for
reasons which he stated in the Daily
were chiefly financial.
"WRITERS NEED OUTLET"
Norberg said in the opening edi
torial that "There are in most col
leges and universities, students who
will sooner or later make names for
themselves as writers of one kind
or another. These student writers
have at the moment no medium in
which adequately to express them
selves."
Denied official status, the Forum
welcomed contributions from other
colleges, included articles on timely
subjects, interviews, verse, views
on athletics and drinking, reviews of
plays and books and some original
stories.
"UNIQUE HISTORY"
Second only to the Daily in age,
the Stanford Quad, from 1894 to
1945, has recorded the history of
the Stanford Family—"a happy re
membrance of the peculiar and
unique incidents of years at Stan
ford," the rst editor, A. Lewis, Jr.,
called Quad.
The first Quads had a few photo
graphs, names and statistics, but
prize poetry and stories occupied
most of the book. The literary sec
tion was dropped in about ten years,
but revived in 1910 with several ar
ticles by alumni. It was then
dropped again and from that time
the trend has been toward more art
and less writing.
ART IN QUAD
The comic section was an indis
pensable part of Quad evidently
until 1939, and since then candid
photographs about campus and
"atry" shots have made a record of
Farm life with the emphasis on
outstanding figures and events.
The laughs in student life have
for the most part been supplied by
Hammer and Coffin's little rag
(mag) the "Chappie." Chaparral
first came out October 5, 1899, with

Bristow Adams us founder and Chris
Bradley as the first Old Boy.
Establishment of Hammer and
Coffin in April 1906 was immedi
ately followed by the San Fran
cisco earthquake.
CHAPPIE S RECORD
Chappie has been issued intermit
tently (396 issues in 45 years) by
Hammer and Coffin members who,
in the words of Chappie's own Hen
rietta Nussbaum, have become
"famed and distinguished citizens
of the world of art and letters."
One issue of Chappie during
World War I was made up entirely
of contributions by Stanford men
overseas.
Just before Chappie's famous cap
and bells and "Now That's" became
well known on Quad, another small
humor magazine called "Josh" had
been published co-operatively by
Stanford and California in San
Francisco from 1896 to 1897.
UNOFFICIAL "NEWS"
Among the unofficial publications
during the '30's was the News, a five
cent magazine published by Dick
Sprouse with fourteen editors. In
an editorial in October 1934, the
News said: "No one knew what the
News was trying to do last year
and this year no one does either.
When pressed, News admits it is a
combination Time and New Yorker
—localized. News is objective, lib
eral, spicy and conceited. The
founding fathers considered the then
existing publications lousy. . . .
They wanted a periodical free to
publish anything; to question the
authority of student, faculty, admin
istration leadership; to show Stan
ford to itself without the usual
rose-colored glasses."
The News included interviews of
professors, comment similar to that
of Time on local events, and reviews
of books, plays and music. It con
tinued selling on Quad for seven is
sues; then was discontinued.
ENGLISH YEARBOOK
From 1930 to 1937 the English
Club issued a mimeographed Year
book of Stanford Writing. Its edi
tors said that they hoped "to pre
sent a clinical record, if not more,
of the current literary effort."
Since that time the outlets for
student writing have been greatly
narrowed. Quad is chiefly a record
of names and faces; Chaparral is a
strictly humorous magazine; and the
Daily is a newspaper.
For many of us the Stanford of
yesterday lives in the words and
pictures of the student publications,
official and otherwise, which have
flourished since the founding of the

ART IN QUAD
The comic section was an indis
pensable part of Quad evidently
until 1939, and since then candid
photographs about campus and
"atry" shots have made a record of
Farm life with the emphasis on
outstanding figures and events.
The laughs in student life have
for the most part been supplied by
Hammer and Coffin's little rag
(mag) the "Chappie." Chaparral
first came out October 5, 1899, with

Bristow Adams us founder and Chris
Bradley as the first Old Boy.
Establishment of Hammer and
Coffin in April 1906 was immedi
ately followed by the San Fran
cisco earthquake.
CHAPPIE S RECORD
Chappie has been issued intermit
tently (396 issues in 45 years) by
Hammer and Coffin members who,
in the words of Chappie's own Hen
rietta Nussbaum, have become
"famed and distinguished citizens
of the world of art and letters."
One issue of Chappie during
World War I was made up entirely
of contributions by Stanford men
overseas.
Just before Chappie's famous cap
and bells and "Now That's" became
well known on Quad, another small
humor magazine called "Josh" had
been published co-operatively by
Stanford and California in San
Francisco from 1896 to 1897.
UNOFFICIAL "NEWS"
Among the unofficial publications
during the '30's was the News, a five
cent magazine published by Dick
Sprouse with fourteen editors. In
an editorial in October 1934, the
News said: "No one knew what the
News was trying to do last year
and this year no one does either.
When pressed, News admits it is a
combination Time and New Yorker
—localized. News is objective, lib
eral, spicy and conceited. The
founding fathers considered the then
existing publications lousy. . . .
They wanted a periodical free to
publish anything; to question the
authority of student, faculty, admin
istration leadership; to show Stan
ford to itself without the usual
rose-colored glasses."
The News included interviews of
professors, comment similar to that
of Time on local events, and reviews
of books, plays and music. It con
tinued selling on Quad for seven is
sues; then was discontinued.
ENGLISH YEARBOOK
From 1930 to 1937 the English
Club issued a mimeographed Year
book of Stanford Writing. Its edi
tors said that they hoped "to pre
sent a clinical record, if not more,
of the current literary effort."
Since that time the outlets for
student writing have been greatly
narrowed. Quad is chiefly a record
of names and faces; Chaparral is a
strictly humorous magazine; and the
Daily is a newspaper.
For many of us the Stanford of
yesterday lives in the words and
pictures of the student publications,
official and otherwise, which have
flourished since the founding of the
University, and the Stanford of to
day will live tomorrow in the words
and pictures ol the campus efforts
today—the Daily, the Quad, the
Chaparral.
During the years since Stanford
was founded, student literary pub
lications have come and gone, some
with amazing rapidity, and some
have stayed to become a permanent
part of Stanford life. Bound vol
umes of all may be read in the
Timothy Hopkins room between the
reference and periodical rooms in
the Stanford Library.
DAILY IS OLDEST
The first publications apparently
have the most staying power. The
Daily leads in age, having been
published continuously since Oc
tober, 1891, the day the University
opened. Published "for, with, of, to,
and by the students," the Daily Palo

Alto, or "Dippy," began as a four
column sheet and with the years
grew to eight columns.
A temporary shrinkage in size
during the recent war has been
done away with and the paper is
now back to the normal size and
regular coverage of campus and na
tional events.
SEQUOIA—IB9I-191!)
The second publication founded
was the Sequoia, on December 9,
1891, which appeared monthly for
28 years. Sequoia contained essays
by professors and students, sections
on organizations, athletics, news
notes, historical material on the
University and the faculty, and,
later, various forms of creative
writing.
W. Nicholson, editor - in - chief,
with twelve assistants, said in the
opening editorial that the Sequoia
"appeared in answer to the general
demand of the student body and the
usefulness of its mission will be in
direct ratio to the earnestness of
that demand. . . . The aim should
be to represent the highest intent
of the University and we take it
that the highest intent of the insti
tution is the composite of the highest
interest of her individual members.
. . . Each and every one feeling a
personal interest and joint owner
ship in the advancement of Leland
Stanford Junior University will al
ways have something to say, and the
columns of the Sequoia are his."
CHANGES MADE
"Radical changes" took place in
1907. The March issue of that year
contained "The Political Machine in
Encina Hall," "Love Letters of a Co
ed," both with illustrations, and an
editorial which announced:
"To the charge of radicalism we
plead guilty, if by radicalism is
meant the making of any change.
. . . The student body didn't care
for the sheet last year and wouldn't
buy it. . . . We cut out the senti
mental stories and crude English 8
themes that had formerly composed
the entire makeup of the magazine
and we filled it with well-written
articles on lively subjects. . . . Now
we maintain that the purpose of the
college magazine is to please the
college public, to represent its
many-sided interests and to give
voice to its sentiments."
MONEY TROUBLE
When Sequoia expired in 1919 be
cause of financial difficulties, the
plague of liteary magazines, it was
revived in October of 1921 by the
Stanford Cardinal. First article in
the Cardinal was a history by Axxhie

Binne. It also ceased publication in
1923.
Next to appear on Quad was the
Stanford Spectator in 1924, which
was published by the Press and
English clubs. It included plays,
poems, pictures, notes on sports and
events, and lasted a year. John
Steinbeck was a student at that time
and contributed some stories and
poems.
A "LITTLE MAGAZINE"
A "little magazine," the Stanford
Lit, came out from December 1925
to June 1929. The Lit "does hope
to be intelligent without being in
tellectual, to be amusing without
being slapstick, and to be sincere
without being bigoted . . said the
editor, E. R. Smith. "Its pages will
contain the best in its field that
Stanford has to give and it should
take its place among the foremost
collegiate literary publications."
A literary aim was also expressed
by Gunnar Norberg, editor of the
College Forum, which first appeai'ed
surreptitiously on February 24, 1931.
The Forum was to have been pub
lished under the name of the Stan
ford Monthly, but was baved from
official sanction by R. E. Swain, Act
ing President of the University, for
reasons which he stated in the Daily
were chiefly financial.
"WRITERS NEED OUTLET"
Norberg said in the opening edi
torial that "There are in most col
leges and universities, students who
will sooner or later make names for
themselves as writers of one kind
or another. These student writers
have at the moment no medium in
which adequately to express them
selves."
Denied official status, the Forum
welcomed contributions from other
colleges, included articles on timely
subjects, interviews, verse, views
on athletics and drinking, reviews of
plays and books and some original
stories.
"UNIQUE HISTORY"
Second only to the Daily in age,
the Stanford Quad, from 1894 to
1945, has recorded the history of
the Stanford Family—"a happy re
membrance of the peculiar and
unique incidents of years at Stan
ford," the rst editor, A. Lewis, Jr.,
called Quad.
The first Quads had a few photo
graphs, names and statistics, but
prize poetry and stories occupied
most of the book. The literary sec
tion was dropped in about ten years,
but revived in 1910 with several ar
ticles by alumni. It was then
dropped again and from that time
the trend has been toward more art
and less writing.
ART IN QUAD
The comic section was an indis
pensable part of Quad evidently
until 1939, and since then candid
photographs about campus and
"atry" shots have made a record of
Farm life with the emphasis on
outstanding figures and events.
The laughs in student life have
for the most part been supplied by

first came out October 5, 1899, with

Bristow Adams us founder and Chris
