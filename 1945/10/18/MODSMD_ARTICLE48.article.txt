# UNDER TWO FLAGS
## 
### 
Samuel F. B. Moorse proposed at
the outbreak of the Civil War that
national United States flag should
be cut in two. The North would
retain the upper six and one-half
stripes and those stars above a di
agonal line extending from the head
of the staff to the lower corner of
the cannon.
