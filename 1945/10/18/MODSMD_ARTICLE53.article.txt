# Japs, Germans Equal In War Guilt--Chiang
## Generalissimo Claims Japanese Must Decide Hirohito's Fate Impartially 
### 
CHUNGKING, Get. 17 (UP).—Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek believes
Japan and Germany are equally guilty of starting the war and that their
punishment should be "viewed in the same lights" he said in an exclusive
interview.
He did not suggest any special reprisals upon Japan as contrasted to

Germany.
The generalissimo said that "the
long view should be taken" and ex
pressed himself openly on the ques
tion of whether any assistance
should be given Japan to help it
emerge from the abyss. He said the
United States should approach the
problem from the humanitarian
standpoint, adding, "Again, I say,
Japan should be treated in the same
light as Germany."
The impression was gained from
the generalissimo that he is not
at all—not for a split second—in
favor of a "soft peace" for either
Japan or Germany, but that his
attitude is practical rather than
vengeful.
The impression was that he is
chiefly interested in seeing emerge
from the chaos left by the war a
world of people with true ideals of
liberty, fair dealing with peace,
nursing no grudges, meditating no
revenge for the war a few years
hence.
As to whether Emperor Hiro
hito should be permitted to con
tinue to rule, he said that ques
tion should be decided by the
view of the Japanese people them
selves.
The generalissimo predicted that
it would be five years before China
could fill the economic vacuum left
through removal of Japan from its
role of exporter to the markets of
Asia. He said close American-Chi
nese co-operation is necessary to
fill the vacuum as soon as possible.
