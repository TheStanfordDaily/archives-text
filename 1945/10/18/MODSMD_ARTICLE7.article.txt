# Farm Flying Club To Vote on Bids From Local Airports
## Students To Fly at Reduced Rates; Aviation Enthusiasts Invited Tonight; Jones Announces Election of Officers 
### 
Sealed bids from two local airports will be opened at tonight's meeting
of the new Stanford Flying Club in the Nitery at 7:30, Chairman Bob Jones
has announced.
These bids, from the Progressive Air Service field and the Palo Alto
Airport, will be on reduced flying rates that can be offered to students.

The club members will vote on these
bids, and when the decision is
reached they will begin to plan im
mediately for arranging a schedule
of flying lessons at the field.
New officers of the club will be
elected tonight, and the constitution,
as presented by the rules committee
of the club, will be voted upon.
The rules committee includes Bill
Bourne, Joanne O'Brien, Marjorie
Newman, George Fulk, Charles
Jackman, Irvin Mallin, and Bob
Jones.
This committee urges all students
who didn't attend last week's meet
ing and who are interested in avia
tion to come tonight. Interest is the
only prerequisite for membership.
Even students who do not wish to
take lessons will be welcomed into
the club, and the committee hopes
to arrange for some ground school
instruction for all students.
