Money Report
Marylou McClure, chairman of
Housing Committee, made a re
port on the use of room and board
money. The money is used for
room and board, and operating
expenses plus a small percentage
for depreciation of the houses and
halls. It costs more for the Uni
versity to run the Row houses
than it did for them to run them
selves because the houses were
run down and had to be repaired,
each house has its own kitchen
and dining room to operate, and
the alumni no longer make gifts
of necessary things to the houses.
If students were not required to
pay for guest meals, board and room
would cost more because dining hall
directors count on a certain number
of students being away for each
meal. Row houses could buy their
food cheaper wholesale if all the
nine houses would go in together.
House Budgets
The budgets allotted to each house
mother and hall director do not al
low exactly the same amount of
money for each girl. However, if
house mothers cannot stay within
their budget for food, they will be
given more money.

bids free phones in houses hav
ing only 30 girls. It was found
that board and room at Stanford
docs not cost as much as it docs
in the larger Eastern women's
colleges.
Fift money that Stanford has re
ceived cannot be used for housing
purposes because most of it was
given for a denite purpose.

dinners between houses on the Row
and the other living units—Lagu
nita, Roble, Union, Ventura and
Branner.
Money Report
Marylou McClure, chairman of
Housing Committee, made a re
port on the use of room and board
money. The money is used for
room and board, and operating
expenses plus a small percentage
for depreciation of the houses and
halls. It costs more for the Uni
versity to run the Row houses
than it did for them to run them
selves because the houses were
run down and had to be repaired,
each house has its own kitchen
and dining room to operate, and
the alumni no longer make gifts
of necessary things to the houses.
If students were not required to
pay for guest meals, board and room
would cost more because dining hall
directors count on a certain number
of students being away for each
meal. Row houses could buy their
food cheaper wholesale if all the
nine houses would go in together.
House Budgets
The budgets allotted to each house
mother and hall director do not al
low exactly the same amount of
money for each girl. However, if
house mothers cannot stay within
their budget for food, they will be
given more money.

given for a denite purpose.
