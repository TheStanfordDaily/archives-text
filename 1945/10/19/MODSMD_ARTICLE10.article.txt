Money Report
Marylou McClure, chairman of
Housing Committee, made a re
port on the use of room and board
money. The money is used for
room and board, and operating
expenses plus a small percentage
for depreciation of the houses and
halls. It costs more for the Uni
versity to run the Row houses
than it did for them to run them
selves because the houses were
run down and had to be repaired,
each house has its own kitchen
and dining room to operate, and
the alumni no longer make gifts
of necessary things to the houses.
