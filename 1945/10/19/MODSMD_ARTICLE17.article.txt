# Cellar Opening Hinges On One Male Hasher
## 
### 
Only one more hasher is need
ed before the Cellar can remain
open in the evenings, announced
Fred Bremcnkamp yesterday.
Brenienkamp was appointed by
Excom recently to recruit inuch
needed hashers for the evening
Cellar-time.
A man is preferred for the last
remaining position, Brcmenkcmp
said, due to the difficulties of ar
ranging late leaves for women
hashers. If a man applies today,
Brcmenkcmp said the Cellar can
probably open starting Monday
night.
Hours will be from !) to 10:.*Â»0,
he added.
