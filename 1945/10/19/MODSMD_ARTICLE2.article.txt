TOKYO, Oct. 18 (UP).-Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur tonight crushed
Japan's narcotic industry—source
of 90 per cent of the world's il
legal drugs -and American troops
searching for war loot uncovered a
hoard of $30,000,000 worth of gov
ernment-owned diamonds which had
been seized from private owners by
forced sales.
The supreme commender issued a
directive prohibiting the planting,
cultivation and growth of narcotic
weeds and ordering the government
to destroy crops already planted.
Headquarters announced it was in
possession of well-documented evi

! dence that the Japanese had foster- j
! ed the use of opiates in Asiatic
: areas "for attaining their quest for |
an empire and as a means of sub- j
! jugating conquered peoples."
The Japanese were ordered to j
make a report within 30 days on j
i the location, ownership and date of j
! destruction of narcotic plantings, i
J The order prohibited the exporta- [
tion of hashish, cocaine, opium and
opium derivatives.
Col. F. Sams, chief of headquar
ters heal section, said the freezing
of the Japanese narcotic industry—
which in one year produced enough
opiates for a 30 year legal supply
—would have no effect on world
medicinal supplies, since Turkey and
other near East countries also pro
[ duce opium.
