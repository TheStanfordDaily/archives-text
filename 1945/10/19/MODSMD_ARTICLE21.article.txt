the dance, and assisting him are his
committee composed of John Ehr
lich, patrons; Bob Bloch, refresh
ments; and Miles Hollister, decora
tions.
Buchanan Hall is the last house
on the Upper Row, Lasucn Road.
Buchanan's Pajamarino, the first
since the Southern Cal game three
years ago, will come to the campus
tomorrow night from 9 to 1 in what
House President Charlie Clark has
termed "is liable to be a panoramic
success."
Formerly the Pajamarino was held
each year as a rally parade before

the football clash with El Trojan.
Cars with pajama-clad Encina fel
lows lead the Row parade to the
Pavillion and then to a local movie
theater.
Corny Prize
A corn cob pipe will be awarded
to the man wearing the most unique
and loudest pajamas.
The women's prize is promised to
be sensationally funny. The spon
sors of this "secret weapon" were
three innocent "Quad-sitters," Shel
ly Cottrell, Margie Aim, and Joyce
Turnbaugh.
Awarding of the prizes will take
place during the intermission, which
will be about 11:30 p.m. The judges
of the best costumes will be Charlie
Clark, house president; Johnny
Ehrlich, house vice-pi'esident; and
Nicholas Golubin, house manager.
Pajamas Preferred
Those attending the dance must
wear a pajama top. It is permissible
to wear slacks or levis but a full
costume is preferred.
The "Buchanan Night-Cap" will
be the featured refreshment of the
evening. There will be plenty of the
concotion for all, and an equal
amound of specialty cookies and
cakes to go with the drink. Sheets
and nightclothes will constitute the
decorations for the evening, and
special lighting effects will be thrown
on these to make the hall seem a
bedrom. Music will be provided by
phonograph records.
Patrons
Patrons and patronesses will be
Dr. and Mrs. Sterling Wheelwright,
Professor and Mrs. Donald McKel
vey, and Professor and Mrs. Clark
son Oglesby.
