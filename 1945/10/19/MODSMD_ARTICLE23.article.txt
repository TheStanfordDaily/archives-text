# Stanford Fails War Fund Drive
## Charity Fund $3,500 Under Quota As Drive Goes Into Final Day 
### 
Stanford was rudely awakened
today to the fact that the War
Fund drive was falling far short
of reasonable expectations.
At 8 p.m. yesterday only $2,510
had been collected toward the an
ticipated $6,000 quota.
The drive is the only charity that
Stanford students are asked to con
tribute toward during autumn quar
ter and one of only three drives held
each year.
Four dollars per student was
being asked by War Board repre
sentatives in each campus living
unit. The drive results have
shown, though, that Stanford stu
dents were not giving this sum.

With the drive in its last day, only
a tremendous flurry of contributions
can enable Stanford to make a good
showing in the national drive.
To collect late returns Mitzi
Gates lias announced that she will
he in the War Board Ollice from
10 to 12 tomorrow morning. Miss
Gates will also he in her oflice
today between 3 and 4:,' to p.m.
"It is not understandable that
the Farm, with fewer students,
donated $5,000 last year and so
far this year has donated only
$2,500," Barbara Bonner, chair
man of the drive, stated.
Aiding Stanford and Palo Alio
community charities, the drive con
tributes 30 per cent toward Stan
ford's own Dimes for Diplomas, aid
ing more students to get their Uni
versity degrees.
The National War Fund quota
has been set at $250,000,000 to aid
oppressed people who are associ
ated in some way with the affili
ated charities. One hundred and
twenty million people will benefit
from America's contributions.
Last year 40,000.000 persons con
tributed to the fund. The money
collected goes to every front in 125
major geographic areas on six con
tinents.
President Harry Truman has
said, in connection with the War
Fund drive, that "all efforts like
it, related to ending the war and
bringing peace, should go ahead
with full vigor."
It was in this spirit that the com
mittee decided to carry on activities
of the drive after the ending of the
war with Japan.
The money collected at Stanford
will be divided between the Dimes
for Diplomas (30 per cent), the
Stanford-Palo Alto War Chest (30
per cent), the World Student Serv
ice Fund (25 per cent), the March
of Dimes (10 per cent), and 5 per
cent will be placed in a floating
fund.
Off-campus students are being
asked to contribute at booths in
the Cellar and Student Union.
These booths are manned by Ro
ble girls and will be open all day
today.
Two Ilohlc corridors, 2-B and
2-C, were the only two groups re
porting 100 per cent. Ilohlc 3-C
had 9fi per cent and Storey had
fi!) per cent to lead the Row group.
Manzanita totaled 71 per cent
while Branner 1-E had 59 per cent.
Adelfa led the Lagunita Casas with
69 per cent and Roble 3-A reported
52 per cent.
Naranja had 58 and Eucalypto 57
per cent while Juniper reported 53
per cent.
Pierce was the first men's hall to
go 100 per cent, followed by Tyler
with 86 per cent; Encina 1-N had 73
per cent and Encina 4th floor 65 per
cent. Van Buren reported that they
had collected 56 per cent.

Stanford was rudely awakened
today to the fact that the War
Fund drive was falling far short
of reasonable expectations.
At 8 p.m. yesterday only $2,510
had been collected toward the an
ticipated $6,000 quota.
The drive is the only charity that
Stanford students are asked to con
tribute toward during autumn quar
ter and one of only three drives held
each year.
Four dollars per student was
being asked by War Board repre
sentatives in each campus living
unit. The drive results have
shown, though, that Stanford stu
dents were not giving this sum.

With the drive in its last day, only
a tremendous flurry of contributions
can enable Stanford to make a good
showing in the national drive.

the Farm, with fewer students,
donated $5,000 last year and so
far this year has donated only
$2,500," Barbara Bonner, chair
man of the drive, stated.
Aiding Stanford and Palo Alio
community charities, the drive con
