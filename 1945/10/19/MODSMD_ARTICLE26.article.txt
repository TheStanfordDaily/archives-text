FULL EMPLOYMENT
Hidden far, far behind news stories of Allied
occupation of Japan, role of the atomic bomb,
llso labor crises, or latest murders, is the story
of a piece of legislation a bill now under com
miltce consideration in the House of Represen
tatives which would be a significant step in
I he progressive development of America if
only eighteen words of its 269 lines were recog
nized and passed: that "all Americans able to
v/orl. olid seeking work have the right to useful,
remunerative, regular and full-time ernploy
ment." For this goal the Full-Employment Bill
offers (a) a statement of government policy, and
(b) a democratic procedure within which a com
plete economic program can be worked out.
Macing the full burden on American capital
ism, Ihe bill declares that it is "the policy of the
United States to foster free competitive enter
prise," and that it is the responsibility of the fed
oral government to provide such volume of
federal investment and expenditure as may be
needed to assure full employment, so far as
piivate, state, and municipal enterprises fall
short thereof.
Responsibility for attainment of the goal is
assigned to the executive and legislative
branches of our government through the fol
lowing procedure:
K ch year the President must submit to Con
grer s a National Production and Employment
Budget in which he estimates (a) the size of the
labor force, (b) the total volume of investment
and expenditure reguired to employ that labor
force, and (c) the total prospective investment
and expenditure for the next ensuing period.
If "b" and "c" are nearly egual no one, includ
ing optimistic businessmen, has cause for wor
ry. Only if item "c," the prospective volume
of investment and expenditure, is greater or
less than item "b," the total volume necessary
for full employment, does the President include
in tire budget a federal program to bridge the
gap.
Postwar developments indicate that "c" will
be less than "b," i.e., total investment and
expenditure will not be sufficient to provide
full employment. In this case the President
would suggest changes in economic policy; if
this will not fill the deficiency, then and only
then, will the President submit a program of
federal expenditure (public works) to make up
the difference, and such public works contracts,
it is specifically written, shall be awarded to
private concerns.
Submitted to a Congressional joint commit
tee, ihe President's budget would be examined
and general policy for the coming year would
ho established. In addition the President would
bo required to review expenditures every three
months and may vary the rate of appropria
tions if necessary.
In spite of the bill's sound policy and clear
cut procedure the Senate has watered it down
considerably by requiring, in the place of the
original procedure, that the President shall
merely submit a "national budget" which (1)
estimates what will be needed in the year, in
jobs, production, and business activity, to pro
vide "full employment;" (2) sets forth "current
and foreseeable trends" in production and em
ployment; and (3) presents "a general program
. . . for assuring continuing full employment."
Still not satisfied, the Senate added, first, that
any spending and investment by the govern
ment to create employment must be "consis
tent with the needs and obligations of the Fed
eral government and other essential considera
tions of national policy;" second, that any pro
posal for government spending or investing
after July 1, 1947, "shall be accompanied by a
program of taxation designed and calculated
to pre\ ent any net increase in the national
debt" over a "reasonable" period.
That leaves the bill in the position, according
lo Senator Barkley, of guaranteeing "every
body out of work the right to seek a job if he
can find one. In other words, if it is convenient
for the government to help him, it will do so."
That takes the bill up to its present position
in the House. The guestion now is whether the
government of the United States is going to
assume the responsibility for full employment;
whether American capitalism can come to real
ize at last that its survival depends upon the
acceptance of the concept "you are thy broth
er's keeper."
