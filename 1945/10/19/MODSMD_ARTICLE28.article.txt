### CATHRYN OWEN 
Dear Momma and Pappa:
Your package came through just fine and thank you
so much for the new slippery action yo-yo. I'm not
half so lonesome in the evenings any more.
I like Stanford and Itoble very much. Every Friday
here is treat night in the dining room, and I've
met such a nice lady in the Library for Students of
History 10, 11 and 12, with an ad joining room-for In
dependent Students.
There are some things, though, that are bothering
me. I know what the little booklet said, so I try awfully
hard not to think bad things, but still I don't under
stand.
For instance, someone is giving a pajama party to
morrow night, and it's for boys and girls all together.
I read and read the Fundamental Standard, but it's
awfully indefinite. It doesn't say anything about wear
ing bath robes, but I guess maybe that all depends on
the weather.
There's been a lot of talk lately about letting us
stay out until on Saturday nights. When the
library closes at 10 o'clock, it takes me three minutes
to get home. But then, I can't speak for everyone,
because I have a bicycle.
Some girls here have organized the "Our Mothers
Let IJs" Club—it has something to do with staying
out late—and. momma, I wish that you'd write and
tell me if you did let me, because I'd kimla like to
join. Of course, I'll look into the policies of the club
before I consider pledging, because I'd never do that
just for the glory of the pin.
Remember the key system we were reading about in
the pamphlet? Well, they've started that at the Nitery
now. And remember, the Nitery is that place "where
Stanford men and women meet between classes to sit in
front of the two blazing fireplaces (good trick if you
can do it all at once), have a coke, or play a game of
bridge." It's rather confusing, having to wait in line
for the people to come out and give you the key. Out
it's awfully quiet after you get in there, and you can
study ever so much better.
I read something in the Daily yesterday that has
me all confused. It said that this weekend people are
going to paste envelopes containing tickets to the
Red and White dance onto cars parked in the Cactus
Gardens. In the pamphlet it said that no partiality
would be shown to people with lots of money, and I
thought that that referred to people who own cars.
Anyway, tomorrow night I'm going to ride my bike
out there, and maybe they'll stick a ticket on my
lender. They're awfully democratic here.
Now just one more thing, in some of the halls here,
when a girl has a birthday, the hashers—those are
people who wait on tables—kiss her. The first time I
saw it was last week, when I was eating with a girl at
Union. The hasher brought a cake to a girl who was
celebrating her birthday, and whose father was sitting
with her. Before the hasher kissed her, he asked her
father, "May I?" and I thought that was awfully nice
of him. Everyone laughed, though, and I don't know
what that meant. I've heard about California morals,
but it's different at Stanford—isn't it, momma?
Don't think that I'm unhappy, momma, it's just that
I'm new here and have to learn a lot of things. I
shovild be happier after tonight, too, because I'm going
to a thing called a fireside at Cleveland Hall with an
awfully nice boy. He told me that all I'll have to do
is sit by the fire, and he'll tell me all about things.

front of the two blazing fireplaces (good trick if you
can do it all at once), have a coke, or play a game of
bridge." It's rather confusing, having to wait in line
for the people to come out and give you the key. Out
it's awfully quiet after you get in there, and you can
study ever so much better.
I read something in the Daily yesterday that has
me all confused. It said that this weekend people are
going to paste envelopes containing tickets to the
Red and White dance onto cars parked in the Cactus
Gardens. In the pamphlet it said that no partiality
would be shown to people with lots of money, and I
thought that that referred to people who own cars.
Anyway, tomorrow night I'm going to ride my bike
out there, and maybe they'll stick a ticket on my
lender. They're awfully democratic here.
Now just one more thing, in some of the halls here,
when a girl has a birthday, the hashers—those are
people who wait on tables—kiss her. The first time I
saw it was last week, when I was eating with a girl at
Union. The hasher brought a cake to a girl who was
celebrating her birthday, and whose father was sitting
with her. Before the hasher kissed her, he asked her
father, "May I?" and I thought that was awfully nice
of him. Everyone laughed, though, and I don't know
what that meant. I've heard about California morals,
but it's different at Stanford—isn't it, momma?
Don't think that I'm unhappy, momma, it's just that
I'm new here and have to learn a lot of things. I
shovild be happier after tonight, too, because I'm going
to a thing called a fireside at Cleveland Hall with an
awfully nice boy. He told me that all I'll have to do
is sit by the fire, and he'll tell me all about things.

Dear Momma and Pappa:
Your package came through just fine and thank you
so much for the new slippery action yo-yo. I'm not
half so lonesome in the evenings any more.
I like Stanford and Itoble very much. Every Friday
here is treat night in the dining room, and I've
met such a nice lady in the Library for Students of
History 10, 11 and 12, with an ad joining room-for In
dependent Students.
There are some things, though, that are bothering
me. I know what the little booklet said, so I try awfully
hard not to think bad things, but still I don't under
stand.
For instance, someone is giving a pajama party to
morrow night, and it's for boys and girls all together.
I read and read the Fundamental Standard, but it's
awfully indefinite. It doesn't say anything about wear
ing bath robes, but I guess maybe that all depends on
the weather.
There's been a lot of talk lately about letting us
stay out until on Saturday nights. When the
library closes at 10 o'clock, it takes me three minutes
to get home. But then, I can't speak for everyone,
because I have a bicycle.
Some girls here have organized the "Our Mothers
Let IJs" Club—it has something to do with staying
out late—and. momma, I wish that you'd write and
tell me if you did let me, because I'd kimla like to
join. Of course, I'll look into the policies of the club
before I consider pledging, because I'd never do that
just for the glory of the pin.
Remember the key system we were reading about in
the pamphlet? Well, they've started that at the Nitery
now. And remember, the Nitery is that place "where
Stanford men and women meet between classes to sit in
front of the two blazing fireplaces (good trick if you
can do it all at once), have a coke, or play a game of
bridge." It's rather confusing, having to wait in line
for the people to come out and give you the key. Out
