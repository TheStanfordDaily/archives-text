"In again, out again," seems to be the title of the
current chapter in the life of Colonel Peron. His mili
tary colleagues ousted him, figuring that he was a sym
bol of the national and international distrust of their
regieme, but then a strange thing happened.
Workers gathered before the government buildings.
They demanded Peron. The main unions called a gen
eral strike. They, too, demanded Peron.
GOVERNMENT REACTION
Police stood near and around the demonstrators.
When similar crowds called for the ousting of the col
onel, the law intervened with tear gas and riot guns.
Now they did nothing. The head of the government
came out at the government, beamed down at the
crowds, and signed documents for the release and re
installation of their hero.
So Argentina's strong man, also, beaming, came out
of the military hospital which had been his unofficial
prison. He made an address to the cheering crowds,
talked about retaining the social policies of his ad
ministration, and the net result was that he was back
in again.
ARGENTINE SITUATION
But this tends to revise any opinion on the status of
Peron's government. The possibility that these demon
strations were "inspired" by storm squads cannot be
overlooked. But reports make them seem somehow too
real, too spontaneous.
It is possible that Peron has been a wiser poli
tician than has been thought. His government soon
put itself on a basis of rearmament and conquest,
and thus he industrialized, to prepare Argentina for
war. Already, a new thirty ton tank and a fast
fighter plane are rolling off his assembly lines.
If this industrialization brought with it great social
legislation along with high prices, Peron might have
gained enough friendship among Argentina's proliter
iat to sponsor his own unions and control the working
man's thought processes. This would give him a strong
basis of support in Argentina, and one that might be
rapidly growing.
The only other possibility, of course, is the prev
iously mentioned one of storm troopers. Yet it seems
that the basis of the republican government has been
bourgeoisie groups who controlled the maior political
parties of the country, and who arc the historical
basis of liberalism any place. Of course the army
renaissance, also was in the liloc. The farthest
left of any group in the resistance movement
were the university students, whose theories come
more from study than from the feeling of class
pressure.
FUTURE
So the possibility is that Peron will consolidate his
regime through a combination of the extreme right
the army and the landowners and labor. But the
center groups are still vociferous about Peron going
down, and the peasants under the landowner.; might
fall either way. The anti-Peron groups probably ho,ld
th" majority.
For that reason, Peron's tenure of power is danger
ous until he can greatly increase the ranks of the
Argentine proliteriat. However, if he goes out in the
near future, it will only be through extreme strife and
violence.
Thai, unfortunately, might be an aspect of the
Argentine picture in the very ntai future.

regime through a combination of the extreme right
the army and the landowners and labor. But the
center groups are still vociferous about Peron going
down, and the peasants under the landowner.; might
fall either way. The anti-Peron groups probably ho,ld
th" majority.
For that reason, Peron's tenure of power is danger
ous until he can greatly increase the ranks of the
Argentine proliteriat. However, if he goes out in the
near future, it will only be through extreme strife and
violence.
Thai, unfortunately, might be an aspect of the
Argentine picture in the very ntai future.
"In again, out again," seems to be the title of the
current chapter in the life of Colonel Peron. His mili
tary colleagues ousted him, figuring that he was a sym
bol of the national and international distrust of their
regieme, but then a strange thing happened.
Workers gathered before the government buildings.
They demanded Peron. The main unions called a gen
eral strike. They, too, demanded Peron.
GOVERNMENT REACTION
Police stood near and around the demonstrators.
When similar crowds called for the ousting of the col
onel, the law intervened with tear gas and riot guns.
Now they did nothing. The head of the government
came out at the government, beamed down at the
crowds, and signed documents for the release and re
installation of their hero.
So Argentina's strong man, also, beaming, came out
of the military hospital which had been his unofficial
prison. He made an address to the cheering crowds,
talked about retaining the social policies of his ad
ministration, and the net result was that he was back
in again.
ARGENTINE SITUATION
But this tends to revise any opinion on the status of
Peron's government. The possibility that these demon
strations were "inspired" by storm squads cannot be
overlooked. But reports make them seem somehow too
real, too spontaneous.
It is possible that Peron has been a wiser poli
tician than has been thought. His government soon
put itself on a basis of rearmament and conquest,
and thus he industrialized, to prepare Argentina for
war. Already, a new thirty ton tank and a fast
fighter plane are rolling off his assembly lines.
If this industrialization brought with it great social
legislation along with high prices, Peron might have
gained enough friendship among Argentina's proliter
iat to sponsor his own unions and control the working
man's thought processes. This would give him a strong
basis of support in Argentina, and one that might be
rapidly growing.
The only other possibility, of course, is the prev
iously mentioned one of storm troopers. Yet it seems
that the basis of the republican government has been
bourgeoisie groups who controlled the maior political
parties of the country, and who arc the historical
basis of liberalism any place. Of course the army
renaissance, also was in the liloc. The farthest
left of any group in the resistance movement
were the university students, whose theories come
more from study than from the feeling of class
pressure.
