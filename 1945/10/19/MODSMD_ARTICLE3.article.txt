# Peleus Criminal Tried
## 
### 
HAMBURG, Oct. 18 (UP). â€”Cap- I
tain Lieutenant Heinz Eck, skipper
j of the German U-boat 852, told a
| British military court today that he
ordered his crew to machine-gun
and "remove all traces" of the tor
pedoed Greek ship Peleus and in
doing so he knew "all survivers
must die."
Eck is one of the five crew mem
bers of the U-boat charged with
violating the rules of warfare by
attempting to wipe out the survivors
I of the British-manned Peleus when
S the ship was sunk in the South At
lantic last year. The trial was the
| first of "submarine war criminals." !
Eck revealed that the Peleus was |
sunk with magnetic fused torpedoes
and contended that his act had been
j legal for "military reasons" because j
survivors and wreckage often at- 1
tracted other ships and aircraft,
j thus endangering the U-boat's safe
-1 ly.
