# University For Women Established
## Modern Mexican College Indicative Of New Freedom 
### 
"The Universidad Femenina" ex
clusively for women is the first of
its kind to be found in Mexico and
is indicative of the recent trend in
that country toward more freedom
and opportunity for women, Mrs.
Yvonne Harley Dane, secretary of
the Committee on Public Exercises,
observed while visiting there this
last summer.
The director and founder of the
modern liberal arts college, Sra.
Ad?la Formoso de Obregon Santa -
cilia, was a guest at Stanford last
spring while attending the UNCIO.
Interested in Stanford
When Mrs. Dane was in Mexico
she collected biographical data for
"Who's Who in Latin America" at
the Universidad Femenina, and
spoke at an assembly to the stu
dents, who were she said very in
terested in hearing about Stanford.
The Universidad Feminina is a
private institution, not connected
with the University of Mexico. The
bachelor of arts is given on the
European system, that is, the stu
dents take more academic work in
less time than under the American
system.
Always Convents
Mrs. Dane said there have al
ways been convents for women, but
not until 1943, when it was found
ed, has there been a university of
the liberal arts for women.
Sra. Obregon de Santaeilia's hus
band designed the architecture of
the building which is modern in all
respects. There are no residence
halls and since it is a private uni
versity the students pay tuition.
