The football experts are starting to scan the gridiron rosters
for possible Ail-American talent. Originally intended to be a
choice of the eleven outstanding football players in the nation
picked by the foremost authority, All-American teams are picked
by wire services, writers, and about anybody else who has ever
sc much as seen a scrimmage.
Way back in 1934 a fellow named Brown was writing this
column. (He never signed his first name.) Here's what he wrote
about Ail-American selections way back in '34:
"The gripe at Ail-American selections is raging once more,
as it always does this time of year.
"We should like to add a few moans of our own, and also to
defend the various "pickers" on certain other grounds.
"A'll-star teams are unfair, there is little question about that.
No one that chooses them can hope to see each team and
player that is considered in action.
"Furthermore, the few players that the critic does see, he can
witness only once or twice during the season, and he may see
the questioned individual in a game he is playing over his head,
or when he has an off-day, as occasionally the best do.
"Then, too, there is entirely too much attention paid to per
centages by all-star selectors. It is considered a breach of pro
fessional ethics if more than two, or at the most three, players
from any one team, no matter how good that team is, are placed
on a mythical All-American eleven.
"Another complaint is that All-Americans are built before
the season ever starts. Newspapers and others connected with
this business of making stars at the offset of a schedule and play
him up in headlines no matter what he does all year. The un
fortunate who is forgotten at this time is destined to become
just another member of the line-up.
"All-star teams, then, are faulty. But they have their good
points, too. They make no claim at actually getting the best pos
sible working combination of football players. But they claim
to gather together a group of names that are, and in most cases
rightly should be, the most prominent ones of football.
While still in the quotation department, here's a snappy little
anecdote that appeared in Slants in 1939. Writer was Jerry
Mayer;
"It's been printed already elsewhere, but the little story Tiny
Thornhill told the Indian gridders in the dressing room before
the U.C.L.A. game bears repeating.
"In the Texas Christian University vs. U.C.L.A. game, one of
the Southern ball carriers took the fall from center and headed
off tackle. He dodged one of the Bruins' numerous colored play
ers at the line of scrimmage and tore through the secondary.
"Another man missed h.im â€”again a colored player. As the
Texan zig-zagged down the field, two more Bruins dived at him
but missed. Both were sepia-hued. Finally there was only the
safety man between the ball-carrier and the goal-line. As the
Southerner approached the U.C.L.A. safety man he noticed that
the latter was a white boy.
"Throwing down the football, the T.C.U. player walked up
to the Bruin and extended his hand, said:
" 'Dr. Livingstone, I presume.' "
