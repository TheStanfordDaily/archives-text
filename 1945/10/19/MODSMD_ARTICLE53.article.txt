# Thomas Talks On Classicism, Progressivism
##

I
In one of the best talks given
since the American Studies sym
posium series was begun last year,
Dr. Lawrence Gregg Thomas, of the
School of Education, yesterday at
tempted to make clear to an in
terested audience the basic issue be
tween progressive education and
competing educational theories.
Dr. Thomas defined five principal
schools of educational thought: the
idealists, the realists or neo-realists,
the neo-Aristotelians, the scholas
tics, and the progressives, who are
opposed to the other four.
The first basic issue, the concep
tion of progress and how it is
measured, Dr. Thomas said, was that
the "classicists," as he termed the
chief opposing school, consider edu
cation to have a fixed end, which
is the inevitable end of a cycle.
Whereas the progressives, stemming
chiefly from John Dewey's think
ing, think of progress as the at
taining of ends which do not exist
timelessly but are constructed out
of the present. Progress is "con
tingent" and "experimental."
In contrast to the "classicists" be
lief that ends are derived from a
higher authority, the progressive
contends that "they are evolved
genetically out of the present." As
an example Dr. Thomas gave the
fixing of the aim of a successful
United Nations organization. The
progressive would proceed from the
successful experience which the
United Staters has had in forming
a unified government to the aim of
a world unity.
They differ also, he said, in the
conception of knowledge. To the
progressive, knowledge has four
stages all of which are essential.
They are, he said, purposes, in
formation, that is collected ideas,
application, and results; and the
first is derived from the last.
On the other hand, the "classic
ist" in theory and in practice con
centrate on the second stage, the
collected information of the past.
To them knowledge is an end in
itself, while to the progressive it is
only the raw material of education.
Following his talk members of the
audience questioned Dr. Thomas on
his controversial subject.—Pinker

In one of the best talks given
since the American Studies sym
posium series was begun last year,
Dr. Lawrence Gregg Thomas, of the
School of Education, yesterday at
tempted to make clear to an in
terested audience the basic issue be
tween progressive education and
competing educational theories.
Dr. Thomas defined five principal
schools of educational thought: the
idealists, the realists or neo-realists,
the neo-Aristotelians, the scholas
tics, and the progressives, who are
opposed to the other four.
The first basic issue, the concep
tion of progress and how it is
measured, Dr. Thomas said, was that
the "classicists," as he termed the
chief opposing school, consider edu
cation to have a fixed end, which
is the inevitable end of a cycle.
Whereas the progressives, stemming
chiefly from John Dewey's think
ing, think of progress as the at
taining of ends which do not exist
timelessly but are constructed out
of the present. Progress is "con
tingent" and "experimental."
In contrast to the "classicists" be
lief that ends are derived from a
higher authority, the progressive
contends that "they are evolved
genetically out of the present." As
an example Dr. Thomas gave the
fixing of the aim of a successful
United Nations organization. The
progressive would proceed from the
successful experience which the
United Staters has had in forming
a unified government to the aim of
a world unity.
They differ also, he said, in the
conception of knowledge. To the
progressive, knowledge has four
stages all of which are essential.
They are, he said, purposes, in
formation, that is collected ideas,
application, and results; and the
first is derived from the last.
On the other hand, the "classic
ist" in theory and in practice con
centrate on the second stage, the
collected information of the past.
To them knowledge is an end in
itself, while to the progressive it is
only the raw material of education.
