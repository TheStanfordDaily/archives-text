# Atmosphere and Plot Give 'Angel' the Nod
## 
### 
JOHNNY ANGEL—now playing
at the Stanford Theatre.
"Johnny Angel" has a muggy, op-

pressive New Or
leans atmosphere
and an interest
ing, complex plot
that combine to
raise it above the
average motion
picture attraction.
George tßaft,
Claire Trevor, and
Signe Hassg. co
star and are aid-

I ed considerably by the appearance
of Hoagy Carmichael as a whistling,
melancholy cab-driver.
Raft Invades Waterfront
"Johnny Angel," another picture
using the revenge motive, deals with
the efforts of the title character
(George Raft) to find the slayer of
his father, the latter person being
brutally murdered at sea. In do
ing so Raft runs up against a gal
axy of strange, worldly people that
inhabit the French quarter of New
Orleans, paramount of whom is the
satiny Miss Trevor.
It is not so much in the story
itself that you will find interest
but rather in the unusual little
episodes that are scattered through
out the picture. EsDecially the
scenes in a cheap waterfront dive
where a growling jazz band tries to
cut its way through a tense, smoky
atmosphere. Or when Hoagy Car
michael mournfully whistles "Mem
phis In June" while waiting for a
fare. These are the incidents that
add up to give the picture its total

effect of depression and degenera
tion.
Trevor's Drink Technique
Claire Trevor turns in another
tantilizing performance in her rath
er thankless role. After seeing
"Johnny Angel," this reviewer has
come to the conclusion that Miss
Trevor is the screen's foremost lady
drinker. I suspected as much in
"Murder My Sweet," and here the
clincher is applied. Claire can real
ly .sip a mean martini before dinner,
not to mention the deft manner in
which she can twirl those olives
around the martini glasses. And
her afterdinner Scotch and soda

technique is impeccable.
The second feature at the Stan
ford is a Monogram release bear
ing the noncommital title, "G. I.
Honeymoon." To tell you the truth,
I couldn't s -e much of this picture
because of the number of people in
the audience who kept getting up
J in front of me and and heading for
I the exits.—Dick Bower.

Honeymoon." To tell you the truth,
I couldn't s -e much of this picture
because of the number of people in
the audience who kept getting up
J in front of me and and heading for
I the exits.—Dick Bower.

JOHNNY ANGEL—now playing
at the Stanford Theatre.
"Johnny Angel" has a muggy, op-

pressive New Or
leans atmosphere
and an interest
ing, complex plot
that combine to
raise it above the
average motion
picture attraction.
George tßaft,
Claire Trevor, and
Signe Hassg. co
star and are aid-

I ed considerably by the appearance
of Hoagy Carmichael as a whistling,
melancholy cab-driver.
Raft Invades Waterfront
"Johnny Angel," another picture
using the revenge motive, deals with
the efforts of the title character
(George Raft) to find the slayer of
his father, the latter person being
brutally murdered at sea. In do
ing so Raft runs up against a gal
axy of strange, worldly people that
inhabit the French quarter of New
Orleans, paramount of whom is the
satiny Miss Trevor.
It is not so much in the story
itself that you will find interest
but rather in the unusual little
episodes that are scattered through
out the picture. EsDecially the
scenes in a cheap waterfront dive
where a growling jazz band tries to
cut its way through a tense, smoky
atmosphere. Or when Hoagy Car
michael mournfully whistles "Mem
phis In June" while waiting for a
fare. These are the incidents that
add up to give the picture its total

effect of depression and degenera
tion.
Trevor's Drink Technique
Claire Trevor turns in another
tantilizing performance in her rath
er thankless role. After seeing
"Johnny Angel," this reviewer has
come to the conclusion that Miss
Trevor is the screen's foremost lady
drinker. I suspected as much in
"Murder My Sweet," and here the
clincher is applied. Claire can real
ly .sip a mean martini before dinner,
not to mention the deft manner in
which she can twirl those olives
around the martini glasses. And
her afterdinner Scotch and soda

technique is impeccable.
The second feature at the Stan
ford is a Monogram release bear
ing the noncommital title, "G. I.
Honeymoon." To tell you the truth,
I couldn't s -e much of this picture
because of the number of people in
the audience who kept getting up
J in front of me and and heading for
I the exits.—Dick Bower.
