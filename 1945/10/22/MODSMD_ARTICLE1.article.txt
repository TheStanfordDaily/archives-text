# Social Group Suggests Late Leave Changes
## 
### 
An Open Letter to Women Students:
The purpose of this letter is to present the
recommendation which the Standing Commit
tee on Social Regulations has drawn up after
thorough consideration of the problems of the
present late leave regulations for the women
students. There have been many questions
such as "Why not two-thirties?" "Why not
have all two-o'clocks?" and many others. The
committee tried to work out the best solution
to the whole problem of late leaves after mak
ing a study of conditions on the peninsula and
in San Francisco, and the following is the rec
ommendation which will be read in Women's
Conference this afternoon:
1. New Lower Division women and all those
with an academic average less than "C" shall
be allowed:
a) One 1:30 each week to be used only on
Saturday night.
b) Three special 2:00 late leaves per quarter
to be taken in place of any Saturday night
1:30 leave.
c) In addition they may have two midweek
2:oo's per quarter to be used only tor
cultural events.
2. Old Lower Division women with 86 units
or less with at least a "C" average shall be
allowed:
a) One 1:30 each week to be used only on
Saturday night.
Jb) Five additional 1:30 floaters per quarter,
only one of which can be used in a single
week.
c) Five special 2:00 late leaves per quarter to
be used in place of any regular late leave
to which the student is entitled.

3. Old and new Upper Division women with
87 units or more and with at least a "C" over
age shall be allowed:
a) Two l:3o's each week, one of which must
be used on Saturday night.
b) Five additional 1:30 floaters per quarter to
be used at any time.
c) Five special 2:00 late leaves per quarter
to be used in place of any regular late
leaves to which the student is entitled.
4. No additional special 2:00 late leaves will
be granted under any circumstances. All vio
lations of 2:00 late leaves will be referred to
Women's Council.
The committee has found that the following
conditions exist on the peninsula and in San
Francisco:
1. All establishments, with the exception of
the drive-ins on the peninsula, close at 12:00
midnight. Before the war, the curfew did not
exist, and establishments stayed open much
later.
2. In San Francisco, nothing is served after
midnight; however, orchestras play until 1:00
a.m. All cultural events are over by midnight.
The main purpose of the Committee on So
cial Regulations is to study the current con
ditions which exist on campus, the peninsula,
and in San Francisco in relation to the social
regulations for women students. The committee
will meet twice a quarter in order to consider
the success and the effectiveness of social
regulations. Anyone may attend these meet
ings, and suggestions and outside participa
tion are encouraged.
