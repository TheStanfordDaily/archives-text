# Lagunita, Union Prepare Spooks For 'Black Magic'
## 
### 
"Black Magic" will pervade Stan
ford October 27 when Union and
Lagunita present their fall quarter
formal in the women's gym.
Tickets, now on sale at the La
gunita and Union desks, will admit
couples to an aura of autumn mys
tery, exemplified by witches, gob
lins, ghosts, brooms, and unusual
lighting calculated to make the most
cool NROTC enthusiastic.
The orchestra will be enclosed
in a witches' hut with eerie atmos
phere surrounding the music for a
distance of nineteen black cats laid
tail to tail, and a huge black spider
may be seen crawling across the
ceiling weaving his invitation to
eternal rest in a spider-web from
one black mask to another.
Silver and black tragedy masks
will provide background for the
dark-cloaked Halloween witches
with brooms who will stand in psy
chological positions around the
dance floor and sneer appropriately
at the mortals having a good time
while the nether world prepares for
Halloween.
In one corner will be a magical
grotto created especially for couples
whose feet hurt and who want to
sit down. Pain from aching feet
will magically disappear and dusky
silence will cast a spell over those
sitting in chairs undoubtedly ob
tained from the Roble Hole. (The
Roblc Hole had its grand opening
last week.)
The grotto has mysterious quali
ties, warn the chairmen, so don't
sit in it with "just anyone."
Refreshments will be served for
earthy-minded souls.
