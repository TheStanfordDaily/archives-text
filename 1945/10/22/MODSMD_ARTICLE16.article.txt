# Greek Chapters Discuss Rigid Conduct Control
## 'No Assurance Given of Active Life in Fall,' States Dick Fayram at Fraternity Dinner 
### 
Provisions for more direct control
over fraternity scholarship and con
duct were discussed as over 30 en
thusiastic Stanford chapter members
met with alumni and faculty ad
visers at a dinner at Bertrand's last
Thursday.
Although adult supervision of the
houses is desired, it will not be
mandatory for individual fraterni
ties to adopt such plans, said Dick
Fay ram, Inter-Fraternity Board
chairman.
Fayram To Resign
Fayram, who leaves this week for
study at the California Institute of
Technology, reported fraternities
may be returned by the University
next spring to allow each chapter
time for necessary repairs.
"Remember," Fayram cautioned,
"that there is still no assurance we
will be able to resume active life
in the houses next fall." Factors
like labor, the number of returning
fraternity men, and squeeze of hous
ing will afTect re-opening time."
Crary Reports Finances
Jud Crary, President of the Palo
Alto National Bank, described the
Inter-Fraternity Commissary which
provides foods mutually for all
houses. He complimented members
on how well finances had been
handled in the past.
Warren Turner, fraternity audi
tor, told the representatives what
costs may be when chapters open,
compared them to pre-war costs.
A new Inter-Fraternity Board
chairman will be elected to replace
Dick Fayram when the board meets
on November 1.
Pledges Enthusiastic
Lee Morrison, President of Delta
Upsilon, said he believed there was
an excellent chance fraternities
would return actively next fall
"provided continued enthusiasm and
lively support if given by present
members and those interested in
joining."

Board Chairman.
