# Farm Charity Collection Goes $1500 Under Quota
## 
### 
The back of the Old Indian, more
than a little bowed by Thursday
night's revelation that the War Fund
was $3,500 short of the expected
quota, straightened out a little Fri

day as he came through to raise
week's total to $4,500.
Still $1,400 short of the $6,000
quota, the last minute surge in the
collection enabled the Farm to turn
over a fair sum to the War Fund
and its affiliated charities.
Dimes for Diplomas, the Farm's
own charity, receives 30 per cent
of the collection while the Student
Service Fund will receive 25 per
cent. The Palo Alto-Stanford War
Chest will be the recipient of an
other 30 pei' cent and the March of
Dimes will receive 5 per cent.
. Chairman of the drive was Bar
bara Bonner. Coordinating the War
Board Representatives were Bill
Ohlandt and Jeanelle Grimsley
while Mitzi Gates had charge of the
collection in the War Board office.
Off-campus collections are still,
coming in and will raise the total,
slightly. Also $200 has been pledged
and must be paid by the end of
November. These extra donations
will raise the final total to close
to $5,000. Off-campus chairmen were
Twink Davies and Angie Griffiths.
Collection in living groups was
done by War Board Representatives.
"All representatives who have not
turned in their money or who have
received late donations must turn
this money in today," Mitzi Gates
said.
The War Fund drive is one of the
three drives held each year. During
winter and spring quarters the Con
valescent home and Red Cross will
ask for campus donations.
