Plans are being made for in
creased representation of the coun

ing groups and organizations on
campus which are interested in the
development of music.
Develop Recreational Singing
"This larger Music Council would
develop recreational singing in the
living residences, and would offer
a direct contact between the Music
Division and the students," pre
dicted Dr. D. Sterling Wheelwright,
assistant organist and lecturer in
music.
Membership in the council now
includes representatives from the
chair, Concert Series Association,
band and orchestra, the Music List
ening Room, Hot Jazz Society, and
a few members at lai'gc.
Spring Sing
"If members from the living
groups were included, the organiza
tion could promote singing contests
and other musical activities at Stan
ford," stated Miss Bull. "People
with a keen interest in music and
time to devote to it will be able to
make (his year's Spring Sing tho
best the school has ever presented,"
she added. "Work would be started
on the Sing in (he early part of the
year instead of the last minute, and
definite rules made available to all
interested."

tion at Stanford, as it was just
started spring quarter. The purpose
stated in its charter is "to super
