RETURN TO 'NORMALCY ?
Ii looks as if the Stanford Indian has gone back into his Ivory
Tower to relax and forget about some of the important things in
life that can prove so bothersome. For instance, take the Stan
ford War Fund drive which ended Friday.
Proceeds from the drive are being divided among the War
Chest, Dimes for Diplomas, and the Student Service Fund. With
a goal of $6,000, only about $2 from every student would have
put Stanford over the top in its contribution to these local char
ities.
Two dollars isn't very much. It is equivalent to about three
movies, doesn't even pay for one dinner at Dinah's or Long
barn, or at any of the other local restaurants. Yet evidently
the average student couldn't be bothered. With over 3,000
students now attending Stanford, only $4,500 was collected for
Ihe drive averaging a little over a dollar apiece from each
stud' at. Drive chairmen were asking, for $4 from each person
On campus.
injure it out for yourself, and you Will find that Stanford
hasn't stood up very well in its attitude and reaction toward the
nef-d.s of local charities. The Victory Loan drive will be coming
up soon, and needs the wholehearted support of every citizen
in the country. There is a peace to be won now, a peace that is
far more important than any war ever fought. It deserves all
vjn can give.—M. S.
