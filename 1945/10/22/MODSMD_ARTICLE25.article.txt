# BULL SESSION
## 
### Cathryn Owen 
Saturday was shock day at J. C. Penney's in Paly. The pajama
counter was swamped with Shameless Stanford couples who
ordered, "Two please —to match." Then they'd have them
wrapped separately for the appearance of the whole thing.
These sinners at Stanford are pretty clever—they have to pass
ar cptitud test. On the outskirts of the mob stood Paly matrons, !
swooning at first, but reviving in time to take rapid shorthand
notes. (The Cal Registrar will pay up to a nickel a word for
Stanford grut—all copy typewritten and double spaced, please.)
On the subject of shock, did y' notice the big brown bottle
lying on the path from Encina to the Libe last week? It stayed
there in all its empty glory for a whole day, before someone
bundled it off to the museum. The illusion was so nice, until
someone wrecked it all with the nasty rumor that it was just an
old turpentine bottle left there by one of the Encina cooks (guote
from Daily Letters to the Editor during the Encina food feud last
year: "I like my women fast, boys, and my likker hard").
This next item isn't exactly a shock—not unless you've never
roared into Paly on a Friday night in the Great Green Bullet.
You're stacked in until the interior looks like one of Pathe's piles
of starved Greeks. Then the door closes. Anything that can't
manage to be clamped in by the door at least up to the elbow
is rejected. Then no one speaks above a groan, and there's
silence, except for little gasps from the overworked oxygen and
the dragging of the bus's axle.
Coming back, there's room for free neck action (literally,
please), and you can turn around and walk and talk and look
at people. It's rather embarrassing when you spy the person
whose shoulder you were perched on on the trip in. You smile
rrther sheepishly at each other, as though you didn't know that
lie has a slight coating of wax on his lower left ear drum, and
as though he didn't know that you have a cavity in your right
molar.
Things in general are gay, though. Everyone's happy after
spending 60 cents at the Paly joy house. If things are normal, a
herd of yelping women will blaze onto the bus and set up camp
in the rear. They're the ones who alv/ays go to the movie late,
so that they won't have to sit through that nasty first feature.
Usually they start their serenade with "Red River Valley" and
then break into something more timely, like "I Hung My Head
and Cried" or "It Ain't Nobody's Business but My Own." It all
ends at the Lag-Roble comer where they all tumble out split
ting the blame- and gallop toward home.
It gets lonesome after that, and by the time the Bullet is
teaiing toward Mayfield, there's no one left except the Encina
cook and me.

On the subject of shock, did y' notice the big brown bottle
lying on the path from Encina to the Libe last week? It stayed
there in all its empty glory for a whole day, before someone
bundled it off to the museum. The illusion was so nice, until
someone wrecked it all with the nasty rumor that it was just an
old turpentine bottle left there by one of the Encina cooks (guote
from Daily Letters to the Editor during the Encina food feud last
year: "I like my women fast, boys, and my likker hard").
This next item isn't exactly a shock—not unless you've never
roared into Paly on a Friday night in the Great Green Bullet.
You're stacked in until the interior looks like one of Pathe's piles
of starved Greeks. Then the door closes. Anything that can't
manage to be clamped in by the door at least up to the elbow
is rejected. Then no one speaks above a groan, and there's
silence, except for little gasps from the overworked oxygen and
the dragging of the bus's axle.
Coming back, there's room for free neck action (literally,
please), and you can turn around and walk and talk and look
at people. It's rather embarrassing when you spy the person
whose shoulder you were perched on on the trip in. You smile
rrther sheepishly at each other, as though you didn't know that
lie has a slight coating of wax on his lower left ear drum, and
as though he didn't know that you have a cavity in your right
molar.
Things in general are gay, though. Everyone's happy after
spending 60 cents at the Paly joy house. If things are normal, a
herd of yelping women will blaze onto the bus and set up camp
in the rear. They're the ones who alv/ays go to the movie late,
so that they won't have to sit through that nasty first feature.
Usually they start their serenade with "Red River Valley" and
then break into something more timely, like "I Hung My Head
and Cried" or "It Ain't Nobody's Business but My Own." It all
ends at the Lag-Roble comer where they all tumble out split
ting the blame- and gallop toward home.
It gets lonesome after that, and by the time the Bullet is
teaiing toward Mayfield, there's no one left except the Encina
cook and me.
Saturday was shock day at J. C. Penney's in Paly. The pajama
counter was swamped with Shameless Stanford couples who
ordered, "Two please —to match." Then they'd have them
wrapped separately for the appearance of the whole thing.
These sinners at Stanford are pretty clever—they have to pass
ar cptitud test. On the outskirts of the mob stood Paly matrons, !
swooning at first, but reviving in time to take rapid shorthand
notes. (The Cal Registrar will pay up to a nickel a word for
