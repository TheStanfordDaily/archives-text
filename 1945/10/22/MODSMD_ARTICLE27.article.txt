# 'England Expected World War'-Professor Jones
## English Department Head Tells Of Changes That Brought War 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
"England entered the war with
none of the usual fanfare that gen
erally goes with wars," said Profes
sord Richard Foster Jones, new head
of the English department, who was
in England m 1939 immediately bo
fore and after the outbreak of war.
"ft was no surprise," he continued,
"rather it was the climax of a grad
ual dragging process that had been
going on for some time.
"The British didn't want war. The
trend could hardly be ignored, but
they struggled against it."
British Determination
Mr. Jones pointed out that gas
masks were issued, before war had
been declared. "The British were
just a little surprised that the Ger
mans didn't attack with gas, before
the official declaration of war," he
said. "When it finally come, there
was no enthusiasm, but a great deal
of determination."
Since Mr. Jones made his first trip
to Europe in 1913, he has spent
nearly eight years at various inter
vals studying and traveling in Eu
ropean countries. He said that the
first of European transformations
that gradually developed into war
were taking place in the twenties.
Italian Visit
"Italy in 1927 was quite a dis
appointment," sjiid Mr. Jones. That
was at the time when Mussolini was
gathering power. "True," he con
tinued, "physical conditions were
good—everything was clean, and
trains ran on time—but the spirit
was bad. The old intellectual atmo
sphere was gone." That was the
last time he visited Italy.
The France that Dr. Jones saw
in January of 1938 was tense with
expectation. "The French seemed to
release their panic and nervousness
through sit-down strikes and dis
orders," said Dr. Jones. "They had
great faith in Daladier," he con
tinued, "and the whole country
seemed to relax a bit when he was
given near-dictatorial powers. The
rest is history."
To Stimulate Research
"The new head of the English
department succeeds Professor
Arthur G. Kennedy, now emeritus,
who has been a member of the
faculty since he received his Ph.D.
from Stanford in ICI4. Mr. Jones
has stated that there will be no
changes in the policy of the depart
ment, though he would like to see
"a stimulation of research, with an
emphasis on systems of education."
"In time," he said, "I'd like to see
the development of research proj
ects requiring collaboration."
In recent years Mr. Jones' person
al study has been mainly on the
history of ideas in the 17th and 18th
centuries. His latest work published
on this subject was "Ancient and
Moderns," which appeared in 193G.
Since that time, he has published
one other book, "Selections and
Works of Sir Francis Bacon."
Loves California
When asked why he chose to come
to Stanford, Mr. Jones, who might
be called essentially a midwestern
since he was on the faculty at Wash
ington University, St. Louis, for 2f>
years, said, "It probably all started
in 1940-41 when I was associated
with the Huntington Library in
Pasadena. That was when I fell in
love with California."
Mr. Jones did his undergraduate
work at the University of Texas, and

received his two graduate degrees
at Columbia University. He began
his teaching at Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, after which
he taught at Columbia for a year.
Then he went to Washington Uni
versity. "You might say I grew up
professionally at Washington"he
said, ''having spent 26 years there."
Mr. Jones was Dean of the Gradu
ate Schgoi at Washington Universi
ty before coming to Stanford this
fall.
