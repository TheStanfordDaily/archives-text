# Truman Faces Wage Problem
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UP).—
President Truman tonight faced a
week of important decisions on la
bor-wage-price problems which
may determine the speed of recon
version.
He is scheduled to issue, probably
tomorrow, a new wage-price policy
statement expected to assure high
er wage rates to keep labor's take
home pay near wartime levels.
He also is expected to issue his
call for a national labor-manage
ment conference here Nov. 5 to de
vise a peacetime substitute for the
expiring War Labor Board in set
tling labor disputes without strikes
or lockouts.
Labor and industry spokesmen
hoped Mr. Truman's new policy
statement will designate some meth
od or agency to determine when and
how much price relief is necessary
to cover higher wages. The war
time method required price-wage
approval by the Office of Economic
Stabilization in consultation with
the Office of Price Administration.
Beginning tomorrow, the WLB
will not accept any new cases for
the purpose of deciding them on the
merits of issues in dispute. It will
accept jurisdiction only in cases
where both parties agree to sub
mit their dispute for final and bind
ing determination by an arbitrator
appointed by the board. The pro
cedure was adopted to enable the
board to clear its docket by Jan. 1
when it is scheduled to be liqui
dated.
Mr. Truman is expected to an
nounce the public chairman for the
labor - industry conference and a
complete list of the 18 labor and 18
management representatives who
will attend,
