### GEORGE ECKSTEIN LARRY FRANKLEY 
MUSIC NOTES
October seems to be the month
of ambition. Three well-established
musicians have announced a separ
ation from their masters. Kitty Kal
len, the Horn's thrush, told the mu
sic world that she would leave the
James' band to go out on her own.
A series of eastern theater dates has
already been arranged. Tommy
Dorsey will have to do without one
of the few remaining "musicians"
in his orchestra when raw-hide
thumper, Buddy Rich, leaves the
"Sentimental Gentleman" to form a
band of his own. Also on the road
to Reno are Les Brown and novelty
songster Butch Stone. The reason
is that Butch believes his appren
ticeship to be over and is going into
the band business for himself.—An
other split-up occurred when Roy
Eldridge left the Artie Shaw group
in Los Angeles. The reason is not
known, but it could be Mr. Shaw's
artistic temperament.—Still another
break-up came when Frank Sinatra
left R.K.O. and signed a five-year
contract with M.G.M.—Bing Crosby
has been in the - hospital with gall
stones, of all things.—Watch for the
improvement of the San Kenton crew
now that ace tenor man and ar
ranger Dave Matthews has returned
to the fold.—A word of explanation
is in order for our all-star band
selections. Our choices were based
on the recorded and in-person per
formances of the artists only during
the past year. •
RIDE, RED, RIDE
Playing their first date away from
the Windy City in many a year,
Henry "Red" Allen and Jay C. Hig
genbotham are now knocking the
customers out at the Savoy in San
Francisco. With the same small com
bo that Chicagoans have become so
familiar wilh. Red and Higgie have
musicians playing with them that
are far more capable than their
music indicates. Red's personality,
so reminiscent of King Louis, is
always an enjoyment; and although
he played very little of his won
derful trumpet, he certainly proved
why lie is one of the top entertain
ers in the business. J. C. was quite
a disappointment! The slip-horn
artist was forced to play with a
mute practically the entire evening
because of bad acoustics, and he
never did get a chance really to
"blow that thing." During the stage
show Higgie had one chance to
demonstrate his talent, and there
especially the lack of inspiration
was very obvious. Don Stovall, the
alto man, was the featured musician
for most of the evening which was
a let-down for those of us who had
come to hear Higgenbotham. Sto
vall's style in which a great deal
of tonguing is used did absolutely
nothing to us. Also during the stage
show came on» of the greatest pleas
ures of the evening. This was Effie
Smith, the former Erskine Hawkins'
vocalist, who chirped her famous
"Effie's Blues." It is great! As we
were on our way out, we heard
some mad jamming coming from a
plac« called the Downbeat Club. We
entered and heard the greatest music
that we had heard in the Bay City.
A small jam unit, this group really
played some wonderful things. Fea
j turing a blind clarinetist that ac
; tually rivals Goodman, this is a ses
sion you won't want to miss!
CROONER'S CORNER
Frank Sinatra's newest platter is
a very refreshing performance of
two very average tunes. Wilh the

Charioteers in support, Frankie
comes up with some very hep phras
ing on the first, "Lily Belle." This
side actually has a beat which is
very unusual for a Sinatra disc.
The record credits are "Frank Si
natra and the Charioteers with mu
sical accompaniment." This musical
accompaniment is a pleasant relief
from the heavily arranged Axel
Stordahl scorings. Catch the
trumpet on the last chorus! The
coupling, "Don't Forget Tonight,
Tomorrow," is a tune exactly like
the title would lead you to
expect, although the Voice tries his
best to make you remember it.
Again the simple background is a
wonderful contrast to Sinatra and
Crosby's Kraft Music Hall group,
the Charioteers. This record wiil
no doubt help reaffirm all Sinatra
fan's faith.
The "Thin Man's" rival, Bing
Crosby, is the other crooner on re
view this week. The Groaner, in
another of his double features, has
the smooth Les Paul Trio for sup
port this time. Again neither of
the tunes is first rate material. The
first, "It's Been a Long, Long Time,"
is easily the best of the two. Der
Bingle is in his usual good voice
with Paul's mellow guitar taking a
very tasty chorus and filling in with
excellent ideas. The reverse is a
tune which up to this point your
reviewers hagj not heard, "Whose
Dream Are You," and after the
three minutes were over, we real
ized that we didn't know when we
were well off.
Even Bing and the nice backing
by the Trio do nothing for this
number.
A WORD TO THE WISE
The Goodman Sextet album is
available in Palo Alto.

RIDE, RED, RIDE
Playing their first date away from
the Windy City in many a year,
Henry "Red" Allen and Jay C. Hig
genbotham are now knocking the
customers out at the Savoy in San
Francisco. With the same small com
bo that Chicagoans have become so
familiar wilh. Red and Higgie have
musicians playing with them that
are far more capable than their
music indicates. Red's personality,
so reminiscent of King Louis, is
always an enjoyment; and although
he played very little of his won
derful trumpet, he certainly proved
why lie is one of the top entertain
ers in the business. J. C. was quite
a disappointment! The slip-horn
artist was forced to play with a
mute practically the entire evening
because of bad acoustics, and he
never did get a chance really to
"blow that thing." During the stage
show Higgie had one chance to
demonstrate his talent, and there
especially the lack of inspiration
was very obvious. Don Stovall, the
alto man, was the featured musician
for most of the evening which was
a let-down for those of us who had
come to hear Higgenbotham. Sto
vall's style in which a great deal
of tonguing is used did absolutely
nothing to us. Also during the stage
show came on» of the greatest pleas
ures of the evening. This was Effie
Smith, the former Erskine Hawkins'
vocalist, who chirped her famous
"Effie's Blues." It is great! As we
were on our way out, we heard
some mad jamming coming from a
plac« called the Downbeat Club. We
entered and heard the greatest music
that we had heard in the Bay City.
A small jam unit, this group really
played some wonderful things. Fea
j turing a blind clarinetist that ac
; tually rivals Goodman, this is a ses
sion you won't want to miss!
CROONER'S CORNER
Frank Sinatra's newest platter is
a very refreshing performance of
two very average tunes. Wilh the

Charioteers in support, Frankie
comes up with some very hep phras
ing on the first, "Lily Belle." This
side actually has a beat which is
very unusual for a Sinatra disc.
The record credits are "Frank Si
natra and the Charioteers with mu
sical accompaniment." This musical
accompaniment is a pleasant relief
from the heavily arranged Axel
Stordahl scorings. Catch the
trumpet on the last chorus! The
coupling, "Don't Forget Tonight,
Tomorrow," is a tune exactly like
the title would lead you to
expect, although the Voice tries his
best to make you remember it.
Again the simple background is a
wonderful contrast to Sinatra and
Crosby's Kraft Music Hall group,
the Charioteers. This record wiil
no doubt help reaffirm all Sinatra
fan's faith.
The "Thin Man's" rival, Bing
Crosby, is the other crooner on re
view this week. The Groaner, in
another of his double features, has
the smooth Les Paul Trio for sup
port this time. Again neither of
the tunes is first rate material. The
first, "It's Been a Long, Long Time,"
is easily the best of the two. Der
Bingle is in his usual good voice
with Paul's mellow guitar taking a
very tasty chorus and filling in with
excellent ideas. The reverse is a
tune which up to this point your
reviewers hagj not heard, "Whose
Dream Are You," and after the
three minutes were over, we real
ized that we didn't know when we
were well off.
Even Bing and the nice backing
by the Trio do nothing for this
number.
A WORD TO THE WISE
The Goodman Sextet album is
available in Palo Alto.
MUSIC NOTES
October seems to be the month
of ambition. Three well-established
musicians have announced a separ
ation from their masters. Kitty Kal
len, the Horn's thrush, told the mu
sic world that she would leave the
James' band to go out on her own.
A series of eastern theater dates has
already been arranged. Tommy
Dorsey will have to do without one
of the few remaining "musicians"
in his orchestra when raw-hide
thumper, Buddy Rich, leaves the
"Sentimental Gentleman" to form a
band of his own. Also on the road
to Reno are Les Brown and novelty

has been in the - hospital with gall
stones, of all things.—Watch for the
improvement of the San Kenton crew
now that ace tenor man and ar
ranger Dave Matthews has returned
to the fold.—A word of explanation

selections. Our choices were based

RIDE, RED, RIDE
Playing their first date away from
the Windy City in many a year,
Henry "Red" Allen and Jay C. Hig
genbotham are now knocking the
customers out at the Savoy in San
Francisco. With the same small com
bo that Chicagoans have become so
familiar wilh. Red and Higgie have
musicians playing with them that
are far more capable than their
music indicates. Red's personality,
so reminiscent of King Louis, is
always an enjoyment; and although
he played very little of his won
derful trumpet, he certainly proved
why lie is one of the top entertain
ers in the business. J. C. was quite
a disappointment! The slip-horn
artist was forced to play with a
mute practically the entire evening
because of bad acoustics, and he
never did get a chance really to
"blow that thing." During the stage
show Higgie had one chance to
demonstrate his talent, and there
especially the lack of inspiration
was very obvious. Don Stovall, the
alto man, was the featured musician
for most of the evening which was
a let-down for those of us who had
come to hear Higgenbotham. Sto
vall's style in which a great deal
of tonguing is used did absolutely
nothing to us. Also during the stage
show came on» of the greatest pleas
ures of the evening. This was Effie
Smith, the former Erskine Hawkins'
vocalist, who chirped her famous
"Effie's Blues." It is great! As we
were on our way out, we heard
some mad jamming coming from a
plac« called the Downbeat Club. We
entered and heard the greatest music
that we had heard in the Bay City.
A small jam unit, this group really
played some wonderful things. Fea
j turing a blind clarinetist that ac
; tually rivals Goodman, this is a ses
sion you won't want to miss!
CROONER'S CORNER
Frank Sinatra's newest platter is
a very refreshing performance of
two very average tunes. Wilh the

Charioteers in support, Frankie
comes up with some very hep phras
ing on the first, "Lily Belle." This
side actually has a beat which is
very unusual for a Sinatra disc.
The record credits are "Frank Si
natra and the Charioteers with mu
sical accompaniment." This musical
accompaniment is a pleasant relief
from the heavily arranged Axel
Stordahl scorings. Catch the
trumpet on the last chorus! The
coupling, "Don't Forget Tonight,
Tomorrow," is a tune exactly like
the title would lead you to
expect, although the Voice tries his
best to make you remember it.
Again the simple background is a
wonderful contrast to Sinatra and
Crosby's Kraft Music Hall group,
the Charioteers. This record wiil
no doubt help reaffirm all Sinatra
fan's faith.
The "Thin Man's" rival, Bing
Crosby, is the other crooner on re
view this week. The Groaner, in
another of his double features, has
the smooth Les Paul Trio for sup
port this time. Again neither of
the tunes is first rate material. The
first, "It's Been a Long, Long Time,"
is easily the best of the two. Der
Bingle is in his usual good voice
with Paul's mellow guitar taking a
very tasty chorus and filling in with
excellent ideas. The reverse is a
tune which up to this point your
reviewers hagj not heard, "Whose
Dream Are You," and after the
three minutes were over, we real
ized that we didn't know when we
were well off.
Even Bing and the nice backing
by the Trio do nothing for this
number.
A WORD TO THE WISE
The Goodman Sextet album is
available in Palo Alto.
MUSIC NOTES
October seems to be the month
of ambition. Three well-established
musicians have announced a separ
ation from their masters. Kitty Kal
len, the Horn's thrush, told the mu
sic world that she would leave the
James' band to go out on her own.
A series of eastern theater dates has
already been arranged. Tommy
Dorsey will have to do without one
of the few remaining "musicians"
in his orchestra when raw-hide
thumper, Buddy Rich, leaves the
"Sentimental Gentleman" to form a
band of his own. Also on the road
to Reno are Les Brown and novelty
songster Butch Stone. The reason
is that Butch believes his appren
ticeship to be over and is going into
the band business for himself.—An
other split-up occurred when Roy
Eldridge left the Artie Shaw group
in Los Angeles. The reason is not
known, but it could be Mr. Shaw's
artistic temperament.—Still another
break-up came when Frank Sinatra
left R.K.O. and signed a five-year
contract with M.G.M.—Bing Crosby
has been in the - hospital with gall
stones, of all things.—Watch for the
