## Powers Protest Russ Treaty 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 21 (UP). â€”Great Britain and the United States have
protested to Russia against a proposed five-year trade treaty with Hun
gary which would give Russia a dominant place in Hungarian economy,
it was understood tonight.
Official sources admitted that Britain had protested and well-in
formed sources said that the action was joint with the United States.
The protest, it was said, was made on the ground that Russia made
it without consulting her fellow allies though Hungary is under a control
commission of which the United States and Britain, along with Russia,
are members.
The treaty, signed early last month, has been approved by the Hun
garian cabinet but not by the Hungarian parliament.
Its ratification, British sources said, would mean that Itussia by
herself had concluded a treaty with an enemy nation without consulting
her allies or even notifying them.
