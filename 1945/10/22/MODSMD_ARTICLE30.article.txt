# Haley Glad To Be Back From Government Work
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Director of the Office of Interna- 1
ional Trade Policy was only one of
the many positions which Professor |
Bernard F. Haley filled during three
years of wartime service with the
United States government. He de
scribes it frankly as a job too big
for one man, and admits that he is
glad to resume his duties this year
as executive head of Stanford's de
partment of Economics. Washington
taught him the value of a little
leisure time.
Dr. Haley accepted the position
in September, 1944 after two years
of experience with the OPA and
Department of State. When he first
took charge his office was known as
the Office of Economic Affairs, but
the title was later changed to Office ;
of International Trade Policy.
Adviser To Clayton
As director, Dr. Haley was chief
ly concerned with the formulation
of foreign economic policies; and
was one of three advisers to As
sistant Secretary of State for Eco
nomic Affairs, W. L. Clayton. His
fellow advisers were responsible for
Finance and Transportation.
The Office of International Trade
policy incorporates five divisions:
(1) Commercial Policy; (2) Com
modities; (3) Petroleum; (4) Labor,
Health, and Social Welfare; and (5)
War Areas Economic Division.
Lower Tariff Aims
First of these, the Division of
Commercial Policy, is largely re
sponsible for the Reciprocal Trade
Agreements Program. Its staff in

vestigate for the President the ad
visibility of lowering United States
tariffs in return for reductions in
the tariffs and other trade barriers
in certain foreign countries.
The Commodities Division is con
cerned chiefly with cartels and com
modity agreements. The United
States is already a participant in
three of these agreements: coffee,
v/heat, and sugar; and this division
is constantly investigating the pos
sibilities of others.
Rubber Problem
It faces postwar commodity prob
lems such as that of rubber. Dur
ing the war our government en
couraged an enormous synthetic
production, but now the British and
Dutch East Indies are ready to sup
ply all our rubber needs.
Even before he was appointed
Director, Dr. Haley was chief of
this important division. In August
1944, at the height of buzz bomb
attacks, he captained a group of
economists and rubber representa
tives to England. There they held
exploritory discussions with British
and Dutch rubber delegations, talks
which later continued in Washing
ton.
Oil Attachccs
The Petroleum Division keeps in
1 close touch with important oil pro
ducing areas such as the Caribbean
area and the Near East. It main
tains attachees in Venezuela, Saudi
Arabia, and other countries to keep
the United States adequately in
formed of foreign developments.
During Dr. Haley's directorship,:

this division was working on an in- j
ternational petroleum agreement i
with the British; and these negotia
tions have since been completed.
The United Slates is allowed three
members in the International Labor
Organization; one from the govern
ment, one from American labor or
ganizations, and one from the em
ployers. Dr. Haley's Division of La
bor, Health, and Social Welfare was
the State Department office respons
ible for the relation of our govern
ment with the 1.L.0.
This division is also concerned
with international narcotics control
and other international public health
agencies. It maintains a system of
labor attachees in about 18 foreign j
posts to keep us informed of de- |
velopments abroad regarding labor j
matters.
Reconstruction Aid
The War Areas Economic Division
worked hand in hand wilh UNRRA
and wilh war-devastated countries
that did not accept UNRRA as
sistance. France for instance did
not ask for UNRRA aid, preferring
lo pay for its own relief needs. But
it did need help in obtaining U.S.
supplies, in adjusting to U.S. price
controls, and in obtaining shipping
space. In the case of such prob
lems as these the War Area Eco
nomic Division was the U.S. agency
which assisted representatives of
foreign governments.
Dr. Haley will speak at the Tues
day Series on November 13. His
subject will be "Our Foreign Eco
i nomic Policy." He is well qualified,
! for he graduated from a hard school.
