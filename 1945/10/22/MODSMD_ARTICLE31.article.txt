# Guerard Discusses Peace at S.F. Club
## Big Three Ways Leading To War 
### 
C 7
Common banking, free trade be
tween countries, and transportation
and regulatory facilities between
European nations were some of the
measures recommended for world
peace by Professor Albert Guerard
when he spoke at a meeting of the
Commonwealth Club in San Fran
cisco Friday.
Present diplomatic policies, he
forecast, will lead the world into
another war. "We are at present at
tempting to reconstruct Europe in
the spirit and by the methods which
have kept it a shambles lor cen
turies," he said.
"If we submit, as we did at Pots
dam and London, to the Balkaniza
tion of Europe, war is inevitable,"
he told the group.
Mr. Guerard, who is professor of
general literature at Stanford and
an authority on world affairs, de
clared that only a federated Europe
will keep the world —and the Big
Three —out of war. Although such
a federation would fail if England
remained aloof, the big problem in
bringing about a union is Russia,
which "considers every move to
unite Europe as a coalition aimed
at her destruction," he said.
America must abandon the "quaint
notion that all Communists are
criminally insane," Mr. Guerard ad
ded, and take steps to remove Rus
sia's distrust and fear of the other
world powers.
"We must choose between the Big
Three and democracy,' he conclud
ed. "The Big Three method, born
of war, continues war —is war."
