# AST Hoopmen In Hot Race
## 
### 
j Undoubtedly the closest, most bit
terly fought basketball battle of the
I current AST intramural season took
| place last week in the Men's Gym
as two top-flight "C" league teams
met. It was the undefeated Coots
versus the once upset Chickens.
The Coots got the jump with a
six point lead but the Chickens then
proceded to get their offense rolling
enough to command a 11-10 half time
lead. The second half was as see-saw
as possible and when the whistle
blew sounding the end of regula
tion playing time, the count read
twenty-seven for each. A three min
ute overtime made things no better
as each outfit dumped in three field
goals, thus necessitating a second
extra period. This time the Chick
ens dumped two goals through the
hoops as compared to one for the
I Coots and thus the game ended, 37-
35, in the Chickens' favor.
Two unbeaten teams of the "A"
loop came through the evening's ac
tivity unscathed although the Vita-
Men had a close call in besting the
Bums, a previously perfect record
outfit, by a 23-20 score.
The power-laden Shushies, vic-
I torious last week in a 107-2(5 tilt,
eased up this week to win only 56-
16. Polan, Shushie captain, once
again took honors as the high scor
er of the evening.
By overcoming the A.T.&Q. Club,
31-24, the Lilywhiters remained as
the only outfit in the "C" "league to
retain an unblemished won-lost
record. The third engagement in
this loop featured a cellar battle be
tween the Runts and the small Giant
Five with the short boys getting
trampled underneath (score unavail
able).
Another fray between two oft
defeated fives occuxred in the "A"
lineup as the B.F.'s clashed with the
Zippers.
