# Varsity Casaba Team Put Into Stiff Drills
## 
### 
Everett Dean will cut today. Twen
ty-five civilian basketball aspirants
will trot out on the gym floor this
afternoon after the casaba coach
slices in half the fifty candidates
for varsity positions.
Buckling down to the serious
work of preparing a team for a
full schedule for the first time
in too many years, mentor Dean
has been unable to give individual
instruction to any of the more
promising players with half a
hundred charges crowding the
court. So far, he has confined the
now daily workouts to lap run
ning, simple passing and shooting
drills, and short scrimmages to
help him weed out the squad.
In deciding which players will
meet varsity standards, Coach Dean
more than likely judged on shoot
ing ability, team playing, smooth
ball-handling, and aggressiveness
and many of the candidates have
shown ability along some of these
lines.
More Will Be Cut
Before finally completing the
make-up of the squad for the rest
of the season, Dean will cut ten more
men from the civilian squad and
add ten from the Navy class which
is now under the direction of Forest
Anderson, Navy instructor. Ander
son was coach of the year last season
at Great Lakes Naval Training Sta
tion.
Showing to advantage during the
last few weeks have been about ten
or twelve men. Of course the most
experienced net men on the court
is Dave Brown, who played first
string on U.C.LA.'s hoop brigade
a few years back.
From last year's Palo Alto In
dependent team, Bobbie Rosburg,
Tom Hood, and Luke Pitts are
shining in the workouts. Pitts,
an all-league guard at South Gate
High, Los Angeles, where he
played three years, is a smooth
ball-handler and brainy player.
He figures to be competing for a
top berth when December and a

hoped-for Coast Conference sched
ule rolls around.
One of the most aggressive ball
players on the boards is Jim Rod
man, all-city basketball flash for
Poly High, San Francisco, where he
played four straight years.
Bill Christiansen, although injured
and unable to play in high school,
is a tricky melon-man and deceptive
passer and should be a great help
to the team. All-league pivot man
at Los Angeles High, Max King,
has been hot off the backboard while
another tall boy who has consistent
ly knocked in the tip-ins is Ken
Dole who played three years at
Webb prep school. Another Webb
graduate, Rod White has made it
tough for other tryouts.
First quarter freshmen, White,
Don Goodenough, and Ed Lefcourt
are strong possibilities to be on the
list that goes on the bulletin board
this afternoon. Goodenough and
Lefcourt are both sti'ong, rangy play
ers who might fit at the center slot.

More Will Be Cut
Before finally completing the
make-up of the squad for the rest
of the season, Dean will cut ten more
men from the civilian squad and
add ten from the Navy class which
is now under the direction of Forest
Anderson, Navy instructor. Ander
son was coach of the year last season
at Great Lakes Naval Training Sta
tion.
Showing to advantage during the
last few weeks have been about ten
or twelve men. Of course the most
experienced net men on the court
is Dave Brown, who played first
string on U.C.LA.'s hoop brigade
a few years back.
From last year's Palo Alto In
dependent team, Bobbie Rosburg,
Tom Hood, and Luke Pitts are
shining in the workouts. Pitts,
an all-league guard at South Gate
High, Los Angeles, where he
played three years, is a smooth
ball-handler and brainy player.
He figures to be competing for a
top berth when December and a

hoped-for Coast Conference sched
ule rolls around.
One of the most aggressive ball
players on the boards is Jim Rod
man, all-city basketball flash for
Poly High, San Francisco, where he
played four straight years.
Bill Christiansen, although injured
and unable to play in high school,
is a tricky melon-man and deceptive
passer and should be a great help
to the team. All-league pivot man
at Los Angeles High, Max King,
has been hot off the backboard while
another tall boy who has consistent
ly knocked in the tip-ins is Ken
Dole who played three years at
Webb prep school. Another Webb
graduate, Rod White has made it
tough for other tryouts.
First quarter freshmen, White,
Don Goodenough, and Ed Lefcourt
are strong possibilities to be on the
list that goes on the bulletin board
this afternoon. Goodenough and
Lefcourt are both sti'ong, rangy play
ers who might fit at the center slot.
—Millar.


DAVE BROWN
Everett Dean will cut today. Twen
ty-five civilian basketball aspirants
will trot out on the gym floor this
afternoon after the casaba coach
slices in half the fifty candidates
for varsity positions.
Buckling down to the serious
work of preparing a team for a
full schedule for the first time
in too many years, mentor Dean
has been unable to give individual
instruction to any of the more
promising players with half a
hundred charges crowding the
court. So far, he has confined the
now daily workouts to lap run
ning, simple passing and shooting
drills, and short scrimmages to
help him weed out the squad.
In deciding which players will
meet varsity standards, Coach Dean
more than likely judged on shoot
ing ability, team playing, smooth
ball-handling, and aggressiveness
and many of the candidates have
shown ability along some of these
lines.
