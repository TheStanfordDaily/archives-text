# USC Plasters COP; Idaho Wins First Game

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 22 (UP)
—If some team within the loop
could knock over the USC Trojans
in the hear future, the 1945 Pa
cific Coast conference would have
the makings of one of the most
wide-open scrambles in its history.
The big chance will be handed to
the University of Washington Hus
kies this weekend when they make
their second stand of the season
against a southern club by enter
taining the men of Troy.
While Coach Ralph (Pest)
Welch's boys were trouncing Ore
gon State on Saturday by a 13-0
count, the Trojans were handing
little College of Pacific a 52-0 heat
ing. The latter game didn't count
in the conference standings, but
it did show that the Jeff Cravath
club had completely recovered
from its 33-6 shellacking at the
hands of San Diego Navy the
previous week.
USC is the only undefeated ag
gregation in the conference but the
general opinion is that the club
probably will be knocked off at
least once inside the league before
the season is over—possibly by
UCLA, or even California, if the
latter club shows any improvement.
Washington, of course, will get the
first crack.

The topsy-turvy race in the north
ern end of the circuit held the
spotlight Saturday and again the
standings were juggled.
use Upset
While Washington was trouncing
USC, University of Oregon was sal
vaging something for the Beaver
state by upsetting Washington State
26-13. The victory gave the Oregon
Club a .500 rating in conference
competition with two triumps and
two losses—the same as that held
by USC.
Idaho romped into the victory
column with a 4(5-0 plastering of
Montana. The Grizzlies decided
iust a couple of weeks ago to
return to the game, and it is
doubtful if the result should be
included in the conference stand
ings. California was idle.
