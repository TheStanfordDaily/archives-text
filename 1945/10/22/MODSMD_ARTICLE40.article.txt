# Fills Lose To Hashers
## 
### 
The Kappa-Dee Gee Hashers vir
tually sewed up the League I in
tramural football crown by crushing j
the crippled BBC Fills, 24-0, in a
hard-lought crucial game played last
Thursday. The previously unbeaten
Fills, weakened by the loss of ace
backs Jask Woods and Pete Brown,
were no match for the smooth
functioning Hasher team, which
tallied twice in each half to notch
its fourth straight victory.
The Kappa-Dee Gees started things
rolling early in the first half when
Willie Davies took a lateral from
Joe Sher and Hipped a paydirt pass
to end Denny Fox. Later in the
same half Ed Luce, who ran his
seasonal scoring total to 30 by tally
ing two touchdowns, intercepted a
Fillie pass and galloped goalward
for the second Hasher score.
The victors matched their 12-
point first half total with 12 more
in the second half. With about nine
minutes left to play, Sher tossed a
pass to Luce, who made a spectacu
lar catch in the end zone for the
third Hasher touchdown and Luce's
second. The final six-pointer came
shortly after when Davies raced 35
yards with an intercepted pass to
the Fillie 5, after which Sher drove
over. All four Hasher conversion
attempts failed.
Davies, Luce, and Sher shone on
offense for the victors but another
major factor in the Kappa-Dee
Gee triumph was the smashing
line play of Denny Fox, who was
mainly responsible for bottling up
the Fillie offensive. Fox's hard
rushing gave opposing passers a
mighty tough afternoon.
Medics Wallop Encina I
In other League I tilts, Medics A
stayed in the running by trouncing
Encina 111, 32-6, and the Chinese
Club entered the win column for
the first time by taking a default
decision from Van Buren.
The high-scoring Hilltoppers,
paced by the running of scatback
Ernie Webb and the passing com
bination of Bob Slobe and Dick
Jones, ran roughshod over Encina
I to win, 47-0, and ran their
amazing scoring total to 124 points
in three games. The Hilltopper
powerhouse was somewhat slow
getting started but piled up 33
points in the second half to com
pletely overwhelm the Encinans.
Webb tallied twice for the win
ners to run his league-leading
scoring total to 36 points while
the Slobe-to-Jones passing combo
was good for two additional touch
downs.
Encina II stayed even with the
Hilltoppers by taking a forfeit win
from Jackson in a Saturday contest.
The Encina sextet, paced by Bill
Lundquist in the backfield and Ed
Lefcourt in the line, meets the Hill
toppers in the final game of the
season, and this crucial match should
decide the League II title.
Cleveland Wins Again
Cleveland's rejuvenated outfit
brought its season record to .500
on Thursday as Jackson again failed
to field a team. The Jacksonians
have five first-stringers registered
for varsity sports and may find it
necessary to withdraw from intra
mural play.
The Army and Medics 111 con
tinued to dominate League 111 after
Thursday's contests. The soldiers
won a default game from the last
place Hayes sextet while the Medics
were blasting Taft, 25-13. Both
teams now have a 2-0 record and
seem destined to battle it out for the
leaguo title.
In the third League 111 contest,
Buchanan eliminated the Phi Psis,
from the running by taking a 12-6
decision. Phi Psi, another team
which has lost heavily to varsity
sports, is also considering withdraw
ing from league play.â€”Gilkey.
