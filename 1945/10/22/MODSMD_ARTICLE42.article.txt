# '35 Gridiron Season Ends in Rose Bowl
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Editor's note: This is the third
of a series of articles on Stanford
gridiron history.)
The season of 1935 rolled around
and as the day of the first game
with San Jose State grew closer,
the Farm's hopes of an undefeated
season and a Rose Bowl bid grew.
Bobbie Grayson, Bones Hamil
ton, and Bob Reynolds, three of
the original Vow Boys, led a team
that looked strong in every de
partment. Tiny Thornhill exuded
quiet confidence. Farm football
fans beat the tom-toms loud and
long.
And they were not disappointed
when Grayson and company flat
tened the San Jose aggregation by a
score of 35 to 0 after a slow start.
But Saturday night found Grayson,
Hamilton and Woody Adams re
clining on hospital beds at the Palo
Alto Hospital.
With the big three out, the Card
eleven journeyed up to Kezar Sta
dium and pulled a tough ball game
with S.F.U. out of the fire by a 10
to 0 count. Bill Paulman's coffin
corner boots kept the opposition
bottled up all afternoon.
The team once again at full
strength, the locals were out for a
big score against U.C.L.A. the next
Saturday, but were jolted by a
fighting and high-spirited Bruin
team by a score of 7 to 6. Never
able to make or get any scoring
breaks, the Stanford team never
got steamed up as Key's touch
down and extra point proved the
winning margin.
In this game, too, Grayson and
Hamilton had to be assisted from
the field.
But the Indians bounced back and
after two weeks of careful prepai'a
tion went north to defeat Washing
ton 6 to 0. Grayson, showing true
All-American caliber, Moscrip, who
toed two field goals, and Muller,
who played a terrific defensive
game, pulled the Stanford team back
into a race for the Pacific Coast
Conference crown.
Santa Clara came to visit the
Farm on the next week-end and
went home on the short end of a
9 to ti score. Buck Shaw, then
Bronc line coach, said that Stan
ford wouldn't be headed the rest
of the season after a slightly over
confident Card hunch racked up
another win on a Moscrip field
goal.
Then came U.S.C. and it was
needless for Thornhill to recall the
vow made in Grayson's sophomore
year never to lose to Howard Jones'
team. And Grayson, although he
had a hard time doing it, didn't for

get. He personally ran the ball into
position for Monk Moscrip's three
point boot in the waning moments
of the clash.
It was obvious that offensive
punch was lacking in the team and
the team polished that department
in its pre-Big Game "breather" with
Montana. Hamilton, Ray Todd, and
Fred Williams led the Stanford
team to a 32-0 slaughter.
And there was Cal. More than
the possession of the Axe rested
on the outcome of this Big Game.
It meant the Rose Bowl. Cal, rag
ing hot after Stanford freshmen
painted the big "C" red, entered
the game as favorites hut soon
realized that the glory of the
roses would go to the Farm this
time when a sustained drive of
SO yards culminated by Grayson's
scoring thrust from the one put
the Indians out in front, a posi
tion they stayed in the rest of the
contest.
A second T.D., scored after Mul
ler recovered a Bear fumble on the
29, cinched the bid to Pasadena.
Southern Methodist, one of the

three unbeaten lams in the nation
faced the Cardinals on January first
Topping. Coflis, Moscrip, Mid
ler, Iliiinilton and Paulman, stal
warts of the home team all sea
son, again came through with sen
sational performances as Stan
ford won 7 to 0 to end one of its
most successful seasons in history.
To Hill Paulman, soph sensation,
went the honor of scoring the six
digits from the one-yard line.
