# Lizabeth Scott Find Of 'You Came Along'
## 
### 
YOU CAME ALONG-now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
"You Came Along" starts out at

a brisk pace as
a n entertaining
war-time comedy
in which a trio of
air corps aces,
headed by Robert
Cummings, barn
storms over the
country in a war
bond drive. For
reasons known
only to Para
mount, their

chaperon is a lady representative
from the treasury department, Liza
beth Scott, a new screen find who
looks like Lauren Bacall and talks
like a graduate of an Eastern board
ing school.

Everything is just about what
you'd expect for the first few reels.
The usual tongue-in-cheek incidents
occur at their appointed time and
Mr. Cummings and Miss Scott, of
course, whisper tender words of en
dearment into each other's ears.
There is even a reasonably funny
scene in Miss Scott's hotel bedroom.
Starry-Eyed Fade Out
But soon we learn that Cum
mings is suffering from an incurable
blood disease. He succeeds in keep
ing this from Lizabeth, however, and
they are married, immediately fol
lowing which, Cummings is sent to
an army hospital and dies. The
final fade-out shows Miss Scott
looking starry-eyed and weeping
that she was glad she went ahead and
married him anyway.
"You Came Along" is a rather
confusing mixture of comedy, senti
mentalism, and patriotism. If you're
one of those people who can ex
perience different emotions every
reel, you'll probably like "You Came
Along." If not, you'll at least find
Lizabeth Scott an interesting, mag
netic screen personality.
"Twice Blessed"
The second attraction is strictly
for the juvenile trade. It's called
"Twice Blessed" and stars Preston
Foster, Gail Patrick, and the Wilde
Twins, the latter duo also being
new "finds."â€”Dick Bower.
