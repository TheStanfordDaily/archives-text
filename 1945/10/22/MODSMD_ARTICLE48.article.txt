# Net Doubles Favorites Win Easily
## 
### BOB PECK 
Connie Wheeler and Tom Scofield
paved the way yesterday for a third
round climax to the all-campus
mixed doubles tournament when
they swept Margo Sorzano and Wil
lie Davies off the court with a 6-1,
6-1 victory.
Wheeler and Scofield will meet
first-seeded Gene Corman and Bar
bara Brooke in the next round in
what may be the best match of the
five week tournament.
Corman and Brooke had no trouble
yesterday in defeating Martin Hoist
and Laura Bliss, 6-0, 6-0 and paved
the way for the third round match
which may be the hardest competi
tion they'll have to face.
Highly favored to sweep through
the tournament, Brooke and Cor
man could have their hands full
with Wheeler and Scofield. Barbara
Brooke's steady playing and Gene
Corman's strong service will en
counter more trouble in the third
round than they met yesterday wax
ing Hoist and Bliss.
All second round matches must
be played by today and posted in
the two gyms. Third round matches
must be completed a week from to
day.
Second round scores will be an
nounced in tomorrow's Daily.
