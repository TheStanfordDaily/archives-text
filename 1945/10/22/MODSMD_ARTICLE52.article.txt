# Myers Praises Stanford Democracy; Considers Self-Government Excellent
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
"In my opinion Stanford has
achieved a higher degree of democ
racy as exemplified by the Honor
Code and her complete self-govern
ment than any other university I
have seen."
This tribute to the Farm came
from Henry Alonzo Myers, acting
professor in the Department of
Speech and Drama. Professor Myers
is on a year's leave of absence from
Cornell University where he is a
professor of English.
Study of Democracy
Although he teaches English and
received the Ph.D. in philosophy,
Professor Myers' prime Interest has
always been the study of democ
racy. "That is why I'm so interested
in a college where a student is re
sponsible for his own conduct," he
said.
His ideas on democracy have
formed the basis for the three books
he has written, "A Short History of
English Literature," which was
written jointly with his wife, Elsie
Myers; "The Spinoza-Hegel Para
dox," and "Are Men Equal? An
Inquiry into the Meaning of Amer
ican Democracy." Professor Myers
had the additional honor of having
"Are Men Equal?" run in serial
form in the summer issues of Blue
book. "Needless to say, I was a
little anxious to see how the artists
were going to illustrate philosophi
cal articles. But they did come
through with some pretty good
ideas," Professor Myers laughingly
remarked.
American Ideas
Professor Myers' interest in
American ideas has even carried
(>ver into his avocation. "I spend
my spare time just looking around
the country," he stated. "My wife
and I travel around looking at ev
erything typically American from

Civil War Battlefields and striking
examples of American architecture
to even graveyards." Professor My
ers, who had never before been to
California, has been spending his
leisure time reading the colorful
history of California and hopes to
extend his travels to include some
of the state's missions and the lo
calities where some of its famous
authors wrote.
"As yet, I've not seen enough of
Stanford students to draw any real
comparisons between them and
other university students," said the
Eastern professor. "However, my
first impression was that I have
never seen such a healthy, good
looking group. I also somehow sense
that they have much in common
with all students throughout the
country.
Words of Wisdom
When first driving up Palm Drive,
Professor Myers says that he was
amazed at both the spaciousness and
architecture of the Farm. "There is
only one other school that has im
pressed me in the same wayâ€”the
University of Virginia. It is of a
similar construction built around a j
quadrangle, but it is supported by i

brilliant white columns instead of
the arcades you have here," Pro
fessor Myers stated. He remarked
that the buff or sunshine color of
the buildings seemed to blend right
in with the California atmosphere
and add a distinctive flavor.
Professor Myers remarked that
he thought any words of wisdom to
the Stanford student body would be
of no real value, but he added, "If
I could say but one word to any
Stanford student it would be to
learn how to preserve all the mar
velous democratic traditions that
have grown up here."
