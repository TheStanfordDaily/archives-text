# Girls Needed To Visit Vets
## 
### 
Mildred Edwards has announced
that the U. 5.0., under the direction
of the War Board, is sponsoring
weekly Sunday night informals at
Dibble this year for campus women.
Ten to fifteen girls are needed
each Sunday night from 7 to 8:30 to
visit and entertain men in the or
thopedic, plastic, blind, and general
surgery wards at the hospital.
The first group of girls will be
from Union Residence. They will
visit next Sunday night, Oct. 28,
under the direction of Marky Cleek.
Miss Edwards stresses the need
for these girls every Sunday night
and has asked that any living group
interested in sending girls some
Sunday night may call her at Lagu
nita for details.
