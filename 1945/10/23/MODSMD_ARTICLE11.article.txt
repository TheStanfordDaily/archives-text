# Meritt Tells Of Chaucer
## Professor Reads in Middle English 
### 
c
Professor Herbert Meritt, reading
from the poetry of Chaucer in the
Briggs Room yesterday, stated that
he was not certain the audience
would understand much of what he
read, and if Chaucer were there he
probably wouldn't understand it all
either.
When he was living in Germany,
Professor Meritt frequently attend
ed Wagnerian operas, but never
understood any of it until one night
when he recognized the word "Sieg
fried." He said he hoped his au
dience would recognize a few words.
Professor Meritt began with the
Prologue to the Canterbury Tales,
which introduced those making the
pigrimage to Canterbury.
Of the many tales, he chose the
one told by the Wife of Bath to
read. It is the story of a young
candidate for knighthood who is
condemned to death because of his
discourtesy to a young lady. Since
he is favored by the queen she says
he will be pardoned if within a
year he can discover what it is
women desire most.
The young man goes everywhere,
but no two people would agree on
an answer. Finally on the last day
as he returns to King Arthur's court
he meets an old* woman who will
tell him the answer on the condition
that he will marry her, and being
desperate he agrees. At the court
the young man says that what wom
en desire most is dominance over
their husbands and lovers. All the
women agree; so he is pardoned.
When the young man tells the
vision rights, Billy Conn and Man
to marry, that everything is up to
her, she announces that that is all
she wanted to hear. She then makes
herself beautiful, and they live hap
pily ever after.
Professor Meritt concluded with
two of Chaucer's shorter poems. In
"To His Scribe" Chaucer wishes a
very bad kind of dandruff to the
fellow if he doesn't take down his
work correctly. Chaucer reminisces
and regrets in the "Complaint to His
Empty Purse."
The poetry reading meetings are
given every Monday from 4:15 to 5
in the Briggs Room of the Humani
ties Building by members of the
English Department.—Betty Barlow

Professor Herbert Meritt, reading
from the poetry of Chaucer in the
Briggs Room yesterday, stated that
he was not certain the audience
would understand much of what he
read, and if Chaucer were there he
probably wouldn't understand it all
either.
When he was living in Germany,
Professor Meritt frequently attend
ed Wagnerian operas, but never
understood any of it until one night
when he recognized the word "Sieg
fried." He said he hoped his au
dience would recognize a few words.
Professor Meritt began with the
Prologue to the Canterbury Tales,
which introduced those making the
pigrimage to Canterbury.
Of the many tales, he chose the
one told by the Wife of Bath to
read. It is the story of a young
candidate for knighthood who is
condemned to death because of his
discourtesy to a young lady. Since
he is favored by the queen she says
he will be pardoned if within a
year he can discover what it is
women desire most.
The young man goes everywhere,
but no two people would agree on
an answer. Finally on the last day
as he returns to King Arthur's court
he meets an old* woman who will
tell him the answer on the condition
that he will marry her, and being
desperate he agrees. At the court
the young man says that what wom
en desire most is dominance over
their husbands and lovers. All the
women agree; so he is pardoned.
When the young man tells the
vision rights, Billy Conn and Man
to marry, that everything is up to
her, she announces that that is all
she wanted to hear. She then makes
herself beautiful, and they live hap
pily ever after.
Professor Meritt concluded with
two of Chaucer's shorter poems. In
"To His Scribe" Chaucer wishes a
very bad kind of dandruff to the
fellow if he doesn't take down his
work correctly. Chaucer reminisces
and regrets in the "Complaint to His
Empty Purse."
