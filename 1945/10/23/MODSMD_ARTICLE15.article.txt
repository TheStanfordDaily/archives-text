# 'A Highland Fling' Predicted Tops By Play Director
## 
### 
Norman Philbrick, of the Speech
and Drama Department, found him
self the proud parent of a dramatic
production last night as the cast and
crcw of the play "A Highland Fling"
went through a smooth dress re
hearsal. Mr. Philbrick, as director
of the play, which is the fall pro
duction of the Stanford Players,
may well be proud of his veteran
performers, as the "Fling" promises
to be one of the best productions of
the year.
Mr. Philbrick has directed many
plays since he came to Stanford in
1942 to obtain his Master's degree.
As a graduate student, he directed
"Thunder Rock" and "Wind and the
Rain," and took part in many Little
Theater productions as an actor.
Upon receiving his degree, Mr. Phil
brick became a member of the di
recting staiT for the Drama Depart
ment., and has directed such hits
as "Happy Journey," "The Little
Foxes," and"The Importance of Be
ing Earnest," his first attempt at di
recting a center-staged play.
Teaches Classes
Mr. Philbrick also teaches classes
in acting, directing, and history of
the theater. He has also taught Eng
lish at Pomona College, where he
took his undergraduate work, and
he has taught playwriting at the
Pasadena Playhouse. Many of his
original plays have been produced
in colleges and at the Playhouse.
"Directing University Players has
proved very satisfactory," says Mr.
Philbrick. "Students arc more co
operative than semi-professional
players, and their training is more
complete, for all the actors are given
chances to play both major and mi
nor roles, and to work as crew
members." Stanford, according to
Mr. Philbrick, has one of the most
thorough drama departments on the
coast, and is getting national pub
licity by the policy of using profes
sional actors occasionally with the
students. The "Fling," he says, is a
gay farcc, sure to catch the public
fancy. The current trend in drama
is toward fantasy plays such as
"Blithe Spirit" and "Harvey." "A
Highland Fling" is sure to have
many amateur performances.
