# Cap and Gown Plans Second Coke Party
## First Off-Campus Women's Social Success, Says President of Group 
### 
With last week's coke party for
ofT-campus women such a big suc
cess, Cap and Gown, women's hon
orary society, is planning a similar
get-together Wednesday, October 24
in Roblc library from 3 to 5 p.m.,
President Barbara Lamb reported
today.
Ninety-two new and lower divis
ion girls are living off-campus this
quarter, many with friends or rela
tives other than their parents. Cap
and Gown is trying to get as many
of these as possible acquainted and

also pave the way for inclusion of
these girls in other campus events,
according to Miss Lamb.
Much credit "financially and mor
ally" for these parties should be
given to the "Y," she said. Betsy
Rabbitt is in charge of refreshments.
The selling of Stanford calendars,
one of the big events sponsored by
Cap and Gown, is planned for eith
er the first or second week in No
vember. Miss Lamb promises "some
thing new in the offing" but said
that exactly what the change will
comprise is being kept secret until
the sale. "We are publishing more
calendars than ever so that every
one can get a copy and not be dis
appointed as they were last year,"
she added.
Proceeds from the sale of calendars
from the Cap and Gown scholarship
fund are awarded to some girl
every quarter in the form of com
plete payment of her tuition for
that period.
Another event on the group's list
of future activities is a tea for mem
bers and alumnae from the sur
rounding area on Friday, Nov. 2.
Cap and Gown was formed with
the idea of bringing together women
active in various fields. Tapping now
occurs whenever necessary although
during the war it was on a quarterly
basis. Members in their black gowns
pass through the dining halls and
tap girls on the shoulder, indicating
that they have been elected to the
honorary society.
Other officers of Cap and Gown for
this year are: Marylou McClure,
vice-president; Betsy Rabbitt, secre
tary; and Pam Strathairn, treasurer.

Rabbitt is in charge of refreshments.
The selling of Stanford calendars,
one of the big events sponsored by
Cap and Gown, is planned for eith
er the first or second week in No
vember. Miss Lamb promises "some
thing new in the offing" but said
that exactly what the change will
comprise is being kept secret until
the sale. "We are publishing more
calendars than ever so that every
one can get a copy and not be dis
appointed as they were last year,"
she added.
Proceeds from the sale of calendars
from the Cap and Gown scholarship
fund are awarded to some girl
every quarter in the form of com
plete payment of her tuition for
that period.
Another event on the group's list
of future activities is a tea for mem
bers and alumnae from the sur
rounding area on Friday, Nov. 2.
Cap and Gown was formed with
the idea of bringing together women
active in various fields. Tapping now
occurs whenever necessary although
during the war it was on a quarterly
basis. Members in their black gowns
pass through the dining halls and
tap girls on the shoulder, indicating
that they have been elected to the
honorary society.
Other officers of Cap and Gown for
this year are: Marylou McClure,
vice-president; Betsy Rabbitt, secre
tary; and Pam Strathairn, treasurer.
