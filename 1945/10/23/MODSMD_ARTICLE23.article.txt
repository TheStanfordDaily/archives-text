# $50,000 Bond Quota Set For Farm Eighth War Loan
## All-Campus Stamp Dance, Auction Will Highlight Week-Long Drive; Amount is Highest Yet Asked 
### 
The quota of $50,000, set by Ex
com for the eighth and final war
loan drive commencing Friday, No
vember 2 with an all-campus dance
and ending a week later, November
9 with a bond auction in the Edu
cation Auditorium.
The quota will be the highest that
the Farm has tried to reach but
will be coordinated for the first time
with the faculty war loan drive. Ac
cording to chairman Connie John
ston, "this should make it somewhat
easier for Stanford to go over the
top again."

The November 2 dance will be
held in the Women's club house and
j admission will be by purchase of $1
I worth of war stamps. It is reported
i that a San Francisco orchestra will
supply the music for the dance.
The November 9 auction which
ends the week long drive will offer
for bond purchasers various gifts
and prizes. The committee is at
tempting to get a big surprise article
to highlight the auction bidding.
Master of ceremonies at the bond
rally will be Don Bechter. The auc
tion will be held at 8 p.m. in the
Education Auditorium so that stu

dents can attend firesides and dances
the same evening.
This will be the first drive that
Stanford students have handled en
tirely by themselves. Previously the
Palo Alto A.W.V.S. aided the Farm
drive.
At the bond auction each bid made
must be paid regardless of whether
the persons bidding win the auc
tioned article.
Pledges through parents can be
made to Stanford's part in the eighth
war loan. These pledges must be
brought to the auction in order to
count on the Farm's total.
Girls in each university residence
will sell stamps and bonds through
out the week. Besides this the bond
booth in front of the Cellar will
be open every day.
Manning the bond booth on Fri
day, November 2, will be the Toyon
Navy boys. Monday the Army will
take over and Tuesday the Navy
will sell again.
Wednesday the student body ofTi
cers will sell bonds and Thursday
the faculty will be on the selling
end. Friday girls from Casa Ven
tura will man the booth.
Co-chairmen of the final war loan
drive are Dede Begerot and Connie
Johnston. Greta Siemen is handling
the publicity and Janie Southerner
is in charge of the bond auction.
Guyla Runyan and Beez Glenden
ning will be in charge of the bond
booths. Johnny Black has been ap
pointed to head the hasher teams
who will sell bonds.
The $50,000 quota will be a chal
lenge for Stanford students who have
gone over the top seven times be
fore. After the recent failure of the
War Fund Drive, the War Loan
committee is pushing the bond sale
even more.
