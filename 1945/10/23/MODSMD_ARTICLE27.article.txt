## WHAT'S YOUR HURRY? 
### 
V/e hear of people taking 21 units without
fail, every guarter; we know of several who
are all set to graduate in three years. We see
fjome who have only time for a coke or a bag
of peanuts at lunchtime, whose moments of
relaxation are accidental and off-schedule,
whose lamps are still shining on books in study-
long after midnight.
This is a peculiar gang of people —they've
decided three years, or maybe ten quarters, is
all the time they should spend in school. And
after making up their minds, they have pursued
their studies vigorously, their grades have
often been classic, and the day of graduation
looms prematurely in view. They're doing an
all-out job of accelerating, and we admire their
fortitude, but we want to ask them, "What's
the hurry?"
A lot of these students have managed to slide
social activities in beside their 180 units; a
remarkable few have managed a successful
extra-curricular career. They've decided study
ing and committee work and an evening or two
at Dinah's will complete their Stanford expe
rience, for these things, by reputation, are the
stuff of which college is made. But the fact
remains — and experiences show — that when
three years were over, these students missed
out somewhere.
There wasn't time to sit back and look at the
Work they were studying, to bring it into per
spective, to digest it and utilize it in their prac
tical thinking and planning. Or there was no
time for a look in the museum (it's on the road
by the Chem Building), or walks around the
lake, or an afternoon of being lazy at the Boat
house. They had to skip the hour or two it
would have taken for a man-to-man talk with
their professors.
The A.B. degree means more than 180 units
—35 of poli sci and 10 here and there in other
fields. Tritely, it includes close friendships and
hundreds of acquaintances and the poise that
accompanies broad social experience. Despite
the bother of the civ requirement, or the biol
logy labs, it necessarily includes them, too.
For some of these students, there is reason
to hurry—med school, perhaps, or the possi
bility of conscription. But for the others, it
is a disease that was caught during wartime, a
germ that said "hurry, hurry, hurry." The ne
cessity for crowding the maximum of expe
rience into every month or every minute is
no longer valid; more often than not, the crowd
ing only diminishes the experience. One year,
or six months more in college is not as big a
slice out of life as it may look from a 20 year
old's perspective.
And so? We wish you'd try and look at
college as more than a vocational stepping
stone, and slow down a bit and spend just a
little more time with us.—B. M. V.

proach, is editing, writing and drawing hilari
ous cartoons betv/een chapters of his new book
—that's what Allen tells me, anyhow.
Gagster Allen went further to explain that
this All-New-Chappie will sell for the same all
time low price of twenty-five cents. Also, a note
from your writer: After extensive research, I
wish to disclose the fact that only about 2500
Chappies will be put on sale. The rest will be
bound and placed in the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution and Peace. The Chappie
comes under the category of Revolution. So,
buy early, there won't be enough to go around.
The jokes in this issue will all be good. They
were last year, so why not now?
But all kidding aside, plan to buy a Chappie
even if it's only to keep off the other sales
men. The magazine gets better with each pub
lication.
