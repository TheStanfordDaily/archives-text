To the Editor:
The choice of "Forever and a Day" as last Sun
day's movie was a happy one; things seem so differ
ent in this, the second month of our brave, new, atomic
world. The scenes of London's great bombing seemed
scarcely less remote than those of 1917 and another
war. (Which one was it now?)
And today sleek men fly back from that same
London (the bombing hardly shows these days) with
smiles on their faces and fear in their hearts. The
American people are back lighting it out on the old
"gimmee' line while French children are starving
—and Polish, and Czech, and, who knows, maybe
even some German. And down in the swarming
islands of the Southern Pacific little brown men
have discovered the word freedom. Preposterous
little fellows! What do they call them, oh, yes,
Indonesians—never heard of them, must be re
lated to the Hottentots.
So let us. all of us, look back over the past six years
(or was it six centuries) and think of the man in the
plug hats, and blood, sweat, toil, and tears (we've
done away with the blood now, at least most of it.)
Let's think of a gray ship in the Atlantic and a piece
of paper with four paragraphs on it. Let's think about
Hickam Field and the men with the funny flat tri
hats on Bataan and why it happened. Let's think
about the laughing, crying, happy people in Italy
and France and Holland, and what they thought about
America. And about the man with the rumpled hair
who flew around the world and wrote a book about
it. Let's remember that August morning when a new
age floated down gently on a Japanese city (there was
a university there with, no doubt, a copy of Shake
speare's plays in its library). Let's think hard about
that one.
And then let us pray to God to give us the
strength, the courage, the patience, and the humility
to carry on the work which we have thus far so
pitiably advanced. —I). 11.
