VENEZUELA STRATEGY
If. is difficult to comment on the full scope of the
Venezuela revolution, because the group that took
power has not had time to translate its statements into
concrete policy. Yet two things about it are clear—the
cleverness with which the upheaval was conducted,
and the reason for popular dissatisfaction with the
government.
There was obviously a guiding genius behind the
whole movement. Maybe he is in the government,
and maybe not, but it is certain that he possesses
quite a bit of power either way. He showed a pro
found understanding of revolutionary tactics and
psychology when he plotted bis coup, and his genius
might soon translate itself into the politics of main
taining his regime.
REVOLUTION
H -■ worked with a compact group of officers, and he
worked secretly. For these reasons, it might be ex
pected that he leads only a minority of popular
opinion.
fie planned for an overthrow of the government by
the military, but not all of it. He apparently selected
his conspirators with care, keeping everything very
secret, right down to the end. He did not try to take
over everything with one fell swoop. Instead, he con
centrated on the two keys to the military power of the
government, the communications and offices at the
capital, and the nearby arsenal.
BATTLE
When everything was ready, he struck. The limited
scope of his first blow made his rising seem weak,
lie only controlled the capital. The majority of the
people were still free to act, and. as he probably
expected, the opposition mohilfr.cd support.
But it came into the open, confident of its numbers.
He, however, had all the tanks in the country, and so
he dispatched them to settle the mobs that were getting
ready to move on the capital. With the overwhelm
ing firepower and mobility on his side, it is doubtful
that the necessary fighting was anything more than a
hasty surrender on the part of the government partis
ans.
IN POWER
But now his group is in power. He has first settled
the question of outside intervention by guaranteeing
respect for foreign oil treaties, Venezuela being sec
ond only to the United States as a Western Hemi
sphere oil producer.
Still, there is the question of mobilizing public
opinion on his side so that his government can be
stable. He can do this by taking advantage of popular
distrust of the old regime.
CONSTITUTION
The reason for that distrust was to be found in the
unsatisfactory constitution of the country. It allowed
for a president with unlimited executive powers to
hold office for life, and also to have power to nominate
his successor. There was a popular assembly similar
to a house of representatives, but it had about as
much power as th" Japanese Diet.
Needless to say, many presidents used this system
to go in for graft on a big scale. The predecessor
of the recently deposed one had no qualms about
making it plain that he rilled through firing squads,
and one of his last official acts was to legitimitize
roughly ol his children.
For this reason, it is possible to expect a seemingly
liberal constitution 1o come out of this revolution.
The cleverness of the revolutionary leadership, how
ever, might dictate this move rather than sentiment.
It would tend to mobilize public opinion at home and
allay it abroad, but the sincerity of the move, if if
arises, can be judged when it is found out if the
next election is rigged or not.

of the recently deposed one had no qualms about
making it plain that he rilled through firing squads,
and one of his last official acts was to legitimitize
roughly ol his children.
For this reason, it is possible to expect a seemingly
liberal constitution 1o come out of this revolution.
The cleverness of the revolutionary leadership, how
ever, might dictate this move rather than sentiment.
It would tend to mobilize public opinion at home and
allay it abroad, but the sincerity of the move, if if
arises, can be judged when it is found out if the
next election is rigged or not.
VENEZUELA STRATEGY
If. is difficult to comment on the full scope of the
Venezuela revolution, because the group that took
power has not had time to translate its statements into
concrete policy. Yet two things about it are clear—the
cleverness with which the upheaval was conducted,
and the reason for popular dissatisfaction with the
government.
There was obviously a guiding genius behind the
whole movement. Maybe he is in the government,
and maybe not, but it is certain that he possesses
quite a bit of power either way. He showed a pro
found understanding of revolutionary tactics and
psychology when he plotted bis coup, and his genius
might soon translate itself into the politics of main
taining his regime.
REVOLUTION
H -■ worked with a compact group of officers, and he
worked secretly. For these reasons, it might be ex
pected that he leads only a minority of popular
opinion.
fie planned for an overthrow of the government by
the military, but not all of it. He apparently selected
his conspirators with care, keeping everything very
secret, right down to the end. He did not try to take
over everything with one fell swoop. Instead, he con
centrated on the two keys to the military power of the
government, the communications and offices at the
capital, and the nearby arsenal.
BATTLE
When everything was ready, he struck. The limited
scope of his first blow made his rising seem weak,
lie only controlled the capital. The majority of the
people were still free to act, and. as he probably
expected, the opposition mohilfr.cd support.
But it came into the open, confident of its numbers.
He, however, had all the tanks in the country, and so
he dispatched them to settle the mobs that were getting
ready to move on the capital. With the overwhelm
ing firepower and mobility on his side, it is doubtful
that the necessary fighting was anything more than a
hasty surrender on the part of the government partis
ans.
IN POWER
But now his group is in power. He has first settled
the question of outside intervention by guaranteeing
respect for foreign oil treaties, Venezuela being sec
ond only to the United States as a Western Hemi
sphere oil producer.
Still, there is the question of mobilizing public
opinion on his side so that his government can be
stable. He can do this by taking advantage of popular
distrust of the old regime.
CONSTITUTION
The reason for that distrust was to be found in the
unsatisfactory constitution of the country. It allowed
for a president with unlimited executive powers to
hold office for life, and also to have power to nominate
his successor. There was a popular assembly similar
to a house of representatives, but it had about as
much power as th" Japanese Diet.
Needless to say, many presidents used this system
to go in for graft on a big scale. The predecessor
