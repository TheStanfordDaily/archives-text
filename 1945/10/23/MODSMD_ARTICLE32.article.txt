## Advocates Creation of Military, Civilian Commission in Magazine 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
Establishment of a military and
civilian commission to make an ov
er-all plan for President Donald B.
urged by President Donald B.
Tresidder in an article Saturday for
the "Journal of Higher Education."
Describing the current discus
sions on this subject, Dr. Tresid
der emphasized the confusion
which could be cleared up hy a
group patterned after the British
Royal Commission or the Baruch
Rubber Committee.
Emphasize Necessity
"The use of the atomic bomb and
the trend of affairs at home and
abroad subsequently only emphasize
the urgent necessity for us to make
a most searching examination of the
problems of defense," he declared.
The need for a peacetime con
scription law would be one of the
leading subjects under discussion
by the members who should be
men of broad experience and spe
cial knowledge as "George Marsh
all, James Byrnes, Vannevar Bush
and Bernard Baruch.
Earlier in the year Dr. Tresidder
was one of the twelve American
university presidents who wrote
President Roosevelt a letter asking
that such a law be postponed until
the end of the war when a thorough
study into the postwar national de
fense requirements could be made.
Supports Military Training
"To avoid misunderstanding, let
me say at once that I belong to

a large group of Americans who
will wholeheartedly support ad
option of universal military train
ing as a peacetime policy, if, after
full exploration, it is established
that such a measure is indispens
ible to our security," he stated.
Dr. Tresidder added that, although
he diil recognize the defects in out
school systems and home environ
ments, he did not want to turn to
the military establishment to solve
problems of health, juvenile delin
quency, or responsible citizenship in
a free society.
The fundamental question is:
How can we guarantee our se
curity and maintain a military es
tablishment commensurate with
our international commitments in
the postwar world?" Dr. Tresidder
declared.
Commission Urged
"The situation requires the de
velopment of a comprehensive pro
gram not only military but military,
economic, social, and political." The
vast amount of research and expert
testimony which a commission
would insure on such subjects as
strategic materials and natural re
sources, industrial capacity, research
and development, health, and educa
tion for defense could develop an
adequate system of defense.
Dr. Tresidder concluded with the
hope that "a way would be found to
assure the commission in advance
that its recommendations would
form the basis for enabling legis
lation."

option of universal military train
ing as a peacetime policy, if, after
full exploration, it is established
that such a measure is indispens
ible to our security," he stated.
Dr. Tresidder added that, although
he diil recognize the defects in out
school systems and home environ
ments, he did not want to turn to
the military establishment to solve
problems of health, juvenile delin
quency, or responsible citizenship in
a free society.
The fundamental question is:
How can we guarantee our se
curity and maintain a military es
tablishment commensurate with
our international commitments in
the postwar world?" Dr. Tresidder
declared.
Commission Urged
"The situation requires the de
velopment of a comprehensive pro
gram not only military but military,
economic, social, and political." The
vast amount of research and expert
testimony which a commission
would insure on such subjects as
strategic materials and natural re
sources, industrial capacity, research
and development, health, and educa
tion for defense could develop an
adequate system of defense.
Dr. Tresidder concluded with the
hope that "a way would be found to
assure the commission in advance
that its recommendations would
form the basis for enabling legis
lation."
Establishment of a military and
civilian commission to make an ov

urged by President Donald B.
Tresidder in an article Saturday for
the "Journal of Higher Education."
Describing the current discus
sions on this subject, Dr. Tresid
der emphasized the confusion
which could be cleared up hy a
group patterned after the British
Royal Commission or the Baruch
Rubber Committee.
Emphasize Necessity
"The use of the atomic bomb and
the trend of affairs at home and
abroad subsequently only emphasize
the urgent necessity for us to make
a most searching examination of the
problems of defense," he declared.
The need for a peacetime con
scription law would be one of the
leading subjects under discussion
by the members who should be
men of broad experience and spe
cial knowledge as "George Marsh
all, James Byrnes, Vannevar Bush
and Bernard Baruch.
Earlier in the year Dr. Tresidder
was one of the twelve American
university presidents who wrote
President Roosevelt a letter asking
that such a law be postponed until
the end of the war when a thorough
study into the postwar national de
fense requirements could be made.
Supports Military Training
"To avoid misunderstanding, let
me say at once that I belong to

a large group of Americans who
will wholeheartedly support ad
option of universal military train
ing as a peacetime policy, if, after
full exploration, it is established
that such a measure is indispens
ible to our security," he stated.
