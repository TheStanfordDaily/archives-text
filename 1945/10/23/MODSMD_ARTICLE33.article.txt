# Junior Tranferees Tell of Ventura Life
## Studies, Good Times, Informality Feature Stanford Casa Activities 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
At the northern end of a path
well worn by the trudging steps of
60 students, who dailj' make then
way through the fields of Stanford
to Lagunita for meals, lies Casa
Ventura, new home of junior trans
fers.
Here the "House of Luck" standi
surrounded by its broad green
lawns, its (lower garden, the arbo
retum, and evergreens. In contrast
to the silent halls of Sequoia across
the street, the rooms of Ventuia
hourly resound to the laughter and
talk of girls who may come any
where from Maine to California.
Here, too, the new students find
time for studies, for informal gath
erings, and for planning activities
for the coming year.
Junior Transfers
Casa Ventura this quarter is un
dergoing a new experiment. In the
past it has been a home, first for
faculty, and then students who have
been mainly freshmen. This year
Venfura is the home of upper di
vision students who have trans
ferred from universities and col
leges all over the United States.
Struggling Together
Marge Irwin, formerly of Mac-
Murray College, Illinois, thinks it's
"wonderful for all the struggling
junior transfers to be all together."
Carolyn Recht, who switched from
Colorado University, says, "It's a
big help to all be in the 'same boat'
and in the same house."
Kellogg Sponsors
Carol Kellogg, Stanford junior
and sponsor for the "Casita" girls,
claims that "it's loads of fun living
over here at Ventura with the trans
fers."
Similar to the sponsor system in
use for entering freshmen, Casa
Ventura girls have Betty Davies and

Jean Gait to turn to for informa
tion about Stanford life, traditions,
and activities.
Fran Jennings, president of Ven
tura, is looking forward to a quar
ter of activities for the casa includ
ing a tea for Mrs. Tresidder and the
resident faculty in a few weeks,
more spreads, several mixers and
open-house parties for the men on
campus, bike rides, and a successful
seasons for the Ventura volley-ball
team.
More Opinions
Concerning Stanford in general:
Holly Rice: "Vassar was never like
this. Stanford just can't be beat."
Pat Bailey from Bakersfield, a
"hep cat": "The dances are super
except for the lack of jitterbugging."
Pat Barret from College of the
Pacific and a member of the Gaie
ties cast: "I like this university life
on a large scale. There are so many
more opportunities that you would
not have in other colleges."
Ruth Philipstall, who hails from
the University of Minnesota: "I miss
Minnesota football games — hope
Stanford has some."
Eleanor "Stewey" Stewart, for
merly of Whitman College, Wash
ington: "Everything has been said
that needs to be said."
This is Casa Ventura. For the
upper division transfers it means
the early morning hike to Lagunita
for breakfast but the good food
when you get there, Connie Cole
man's laugh. Marilyn Dentoni play
ing "Rhapsody in Blue," Joyce Stall
fort on the phone, the barbecue pit
you can't find, the bikes in the rack,
Joyce Kennedy, Mary Vilas, Caro
lyn Poulson, and Sue Proctor ask
ing, "Does anyone have time to play
bridge," and also the girl who gets
up at 7 on Saturday morning and
screams, "Is anyone sleeping until
10?"
Yes—that's Casa Ventura!
