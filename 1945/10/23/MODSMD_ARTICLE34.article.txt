"We don't know what to call it,
but we want everyone to come,"
said Betty Wellington, co-chairman
of a regular Wednesday afternoon
tea-social periodâ€”and musical two
hours, revived as a part of."Y" post
war activities.
"We hope that Stanford men and
women will enjoy dropping in, vis
iting, and having tea and cookies
in the "Y" lounge, just to relax and
meet other students tomorrow after
noon," continued Miss Wellington.
According to Miss Patricia David
son, executive secretary of the
Stanford YWCA. "This is a custom
we are reviving now the war is
over. We hope to make Wednes
day afternoon from 3 to 5 a regular
social period for every student on
the campus who cares to drop in."
The Wednesday afternoon period
is sponsored by the "Y" social com
mittee headed by co-chairmen Rosa
lind Murray and Betty Wellington.
"Y" Lounge is on the third floor
of the women's clubhouse.
