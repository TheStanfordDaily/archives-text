# Hashers Tell Joys of Work
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
The crowd of milling, laughing
girls stands outside the dining hall
on the Lagunita terrace. Then the
doors open. There is a mad dash
for chairs, tables, and food.
But what of those white-coated,
and tan smocked figures who stand
along the wall? What is their re
action to the headlong rush of Lag
unita and Vetnura coeds, or rather
just hashing in general?
Leonard Saxe, head hasher at Lag
unita claims: "The only way to
really eat well on the campus is to
hash—fun too."
Charles Jackman, another con
noisseur says, "It's disadvantages are
offset by the excellent food we re
ceive as remuneration, so why not?"
Wallace McCall who thinks that
hashing is "wild fun" adds, "I think
our head hashers are the very best
hashers on campus."
Connie Jones speaks for the wom
en: "I like hashing because the
girls are so cooperative."
Ellen Davis adds, "At its worst
you can always look on it as a sort
of sociological survey."
The hashers have their gripes too,
among them, late comers and girls
who read the Daily over the break
fast table. Behind the scenes the
dish-washers' pet peeve is lipstick
on spoons.
Nevertheless, the Farm students
whose motto is "celerity and dis
patch with a smile" on the whole
seem to think that the advantages
of hashing outweigh the disadvant
ages. So if you want to meet a lot
of attractive girls in addition to
having a mea! with two helpings
of every course why not try bal
ancing a tray next quarter?
