(This story is a conclusion of last Thursday's review of
intramural activities during the past year and one-half.)
Since Stanford retired from intercollegiate athletics more
than two years ago, the students' only answer to the cry of "re
turn to competition" was the formation of the Palo Alto Inde
pendents basketball and baseball teams. The team was formed
and captained by Dave Brown, now a medical student at San
Francisco and prospective starter on the Indian five this year.
Edged San Bruno
Without the aid of proper coaching and training, no team can
be expected to do very well, but these boys had more spirit than
most, and fought to a noteworthy victory over San Bruno Navy.
The Independents were completely swamped by the Navy men
for the first half and most of the second, but with the score 34-16
and only ten minutes remaining to play, the Stanfordites went
cn a scoring spree that left the crowd hunting for adding ma
chines. Sparked by Ed Douglas, Dave tfrown, and Morley
Thompson, the Independents racked up 28 points in ten minutes
to edge out San Bruno 44-43. In a three-game series with Au
ten's, they won two out of three, and although they lost a few
games in San Francisco circles, they showed the makings of a
good team.
The independent baseball squad organized and led by Bob
Rosburg was only a partial success, but the thought behind the
formation of this team was sound. Hitting power and hitting
both were lacking as well as adequate reserves to bolster the
team's strength.
Lit a Spark
These teams, however, lit a spark for Stanford's athletic
future, a spark which has been slowly fanned into a bonfire as
evidenced by the Cardinals' wholesale return to sports this year
and next.
