# Intramural Footballers Enter Third Week of Play Tomorrow
## 
### 
Intramural football play swings
into its third week tomorrow after
noon as league leaders in each of
the three circuits face somewhat
light opposition. Army and Medics
111, currently topping the stand
ings in League 111, draw the tough
est foes in Encina IV and Phi Psi
respectively, but even they should
get through with comparative ease.
The Kappa-Dee Gee Hashers, rid
ing high, wide, and handsome in
League I. draw a bye, while the Hill
toppers, holding down top billing
in League 11, face a weakened Fire
house outfit that seems to be having
trouble staying on its feet.
At present, League 111 looks
like the closest battle, with the
powerful Army aggregation chal
lenged by a strong Medic sextet
in the race for the title. IJuchan
an, although downed, 13-7, by the
Medics, is still in the running,
and once-tied Encina IV, al
though holding only one victory,
cannot be discounted yet. From
here it looks like the Army, by
virtue of its superior offensive
ability, should cop the crown hut
the Medics, paced by Doc Mason
of baseball fame, are primed to
give the soldiers a real battle
when the two squads clash.
Hilltoppers Pile Up Points
In the third League 111 contest
tomorrow, Taft, which hasn't shown
up too badly in recent outings, en
gages unvictorious Hayes, which
seems to be forfeiting rather regu
larly. If the game does come off,

Taft should pull through with their
second win of the season.
The League II situation finds the
Hilltoppers definitely holding the
upper hand, although tied in per
centage points by Encina 11. Three
convincing victories have given the
Arthur-Tyler sextet a total of 124
points to none for their opponents,
while against similar opposition, the
Encinans have been finding the go
ing much tougher. However, the
Encina boys are really pointing for
the final game of the season when
they hope to upset the Hilltoppers
in the championship match.
In tomorrow's League II games,
the Hilltoppers figure to get by the
Firehouse without too much trou
ble, but Encina I! runs up against
a more formidable foe in Cleve
land. Cleveland, which has
changed almost their entire start
ing line-up since their 51-0
shellacking at the hands of the
Hilltoppers in the first game of
the season, has won their last
two straight and appear to be on
the upgrade. However, we'll still
take Encina, but not by any 51 -0
margin. This game might be just
the place for an upset.
Jefferson and Encina I, two clubs
which aren't going much of any

place, collide in the final League II
iussle.
Hashers Clinch League I
League I is all Kappa-Dee Gee,
and about the only item of interest
left in this circuit is the battle for
second place between the BBC Fills
and Medics A. Both teams are play
ing pretty good football and have
only lost to the Kappa-Dee Gees.
Tomorrow the injury-riddled Fills
take on the second-division Chinese
Club while the Medics tackle En
cina 111. Neither second-place con
tender should bow, barring an
astounding upset.
Pierce and Van Buren, now oc
cupying the League I cellar, battle
it out in the final League I game,
with both teams hoping for their
initial victory.
Coach Elwyn Bugge, who is
handling the intramural program,
urges that all team managers re
port promptly for equipment at
4:15 in order that the games may
get rolling promptly at 4.:{0. Any
team which cannot field six men
and desires a postponement should
try to arrange a week-end date
with Coach Bugge so that the
team will not suffer a forfeit loss.

light opposition. Army and Medics
111, currently topping the stand

toppers, holding down top billing

At present, League 111 looks
like the closest battle, with the
powerful Army aggregation chal
lenged by a strong Medic sextet
in the race for the title. IJuchan
an, although downed, 13-7, by the
Medics, is still in the running,
and once-tied Encina IV, al
though holding only one victory,
cannot be discounted yet. From
here it looks like the Army, by

the Medics, paced by Doc Mason

Hilltoppers Pile Up Points
In the third League 111 contest
tomorrow, Taft, which hasn't shown
up too badly in recent outings, en
gages unvictorious Hayes, which
seems to be forfeiting rather regu
larly. If the game does come off,

Taft should pull through with their
second win of the season.
The League II situation finds the
Hilltoppers definitely holding the
upper hand, although tied in per
centage points by Encina 11. Three
convincing victories have given the
Arthur-Tyler sextet a total of 124
points to none for their opponents,
while against similar opposition, the
Encinans have been finding the go
ing much tougher. However, the
Encina boys are really pointing for
the final game of the season when
they hope to upset the Hilltoppers
in the championship match.
In tomorrow's League II games,
the Hilltoppers figure to get by the
Firehouse without too much trou

a more formidable foe in Cleve

changed almost their entire start
ing line-up since their 51-0
shellacking at the hands of the
Hilltoppers in the first game of
the season, has won their last
two straight and appear to be on
the upgrade. However, we'll still
take Encina, but not by any 51 -0

the place for an upset.

Tomorrow the injury-riddled Fills
