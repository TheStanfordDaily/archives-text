# Complete Outfits Worn by Varsity
## 
### 
Full football togs were worn by
the varsity football squad yesterday
for the first time. Coach Schwartz
had the tackling dummy and
the backs running through some of
the plays.
The head coach has not been able
to single out any players yet for
outstanding play, but by the end of
the week—when the first scrimmage
is scheduled—a fair idea of the
squad ought to be formed by the
coach. Assisting Schwartz are Fritz
Wilcox and Fred Scribner.
No games with any service teams
have been scheduled yet, according
to A 1 Masters, graduate manager.
