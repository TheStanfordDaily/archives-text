a last-minute squabble over tele
ugly old woman, whom he is loth
ager Johnny Ray have signed for
the $3,000,000 return title fight with
Joe Louis in June. The contract's
provisions included:
1. Conn guarantees Louis a re
turn championship bout within 1)0
days, in case he wrests the crown
from Bomber Joe.
2. Conn is bound to fight exclu
sively for promoter Mike Jacobs for
a period of five years if he becomes
champion. However, Manager Ray
must approve all opponents.
3. Conn can have no tune-up
bouts before he meets Louis; how
ever he will be permitted to make
exhibition, refereeing and radio ap
pearances.
4. Conn will receive 20 per cent of
the net gate; also 20 per cent of the
net receipts from movies and the
radio.
5. Jacobs agrees to sell television
rights for the June bout as a "lone
parcel," instead of wrapping them
up in a blanket sale of all television
rights of the Twentieth Century
Club on an annual basis. And Ja
cobs agrees to give Conn 20 per cent
of the television proceeds of the
match.
