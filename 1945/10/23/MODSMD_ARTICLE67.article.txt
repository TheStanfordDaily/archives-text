# Communists Achieve Power
## French Leftists In First Victory 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 22 (UP).â€”The Com
munists, for the first time in history,
emerged as the strongest political
party in France tonight, capturing
at least 146 seats in the assembly
which will write a constitution for
a Fourth Republic.
In a leftward swing comparable to
that of last summer which ousted
Winston Churchill's Conservative
party from power in Britain, the
Communists won more seats than
either Leon Blum's Socialists or the
Popular Republican Movement (the
MRP), considered to be General
Charles De Gaulle's own party.
Each of the latter parties won 135
seats in the constituent assembly,
unofficial returns showed, making it
impossible for any of the three to
swing any issues in the assembly
without a coalition.
The Communists had campaigned
in favor of a new constitution, re
placing that under which cabinets
had fallen an average of twice a
year, but were in favor of voting
the new assembly unlimited powers
under which it could form its own
type of interim government.
The heaviest Communist vote
came from the Paris area, which was
almost 100 per cent.
