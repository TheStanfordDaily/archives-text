# President To Discuss Training
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 (UP).â€”
President Truman today discussed
with legislative leaders his message
to Congress tomorrow on peace
time military training, and Senate
Democratic Leader Alben W. Bark
ley of Kentucky predicted after
ward that it would call for "some
modification" of compulsory mili
tary training.
"I imagine it will be some modi
fication of what we always have
known as compulsory military
training," he told reporters. "I do
not know what modifications it in
cludes."
White House Secretary Eben
Ayres said that all the newspaper
speculation on what Mr. Truman
will say about military training is
wrong. He said there has been a
lot of speculation, and added:
"All the dope stories we have
seen so far are wrong."
Sidestep Expected
Some congressional sources ex
pect the President to sidestep any
demand for compulsory training and
to concentrate instead on proposals
to build up the National Guard and
the Pieserve Officers' Training Corps
in high schools and colleges.
Mr. Truman will deliver the mes
sage at 12:30 p.m. (EST) tomorrow.
It will be broadcast over major net
works.

The Navy meanwhile announced
additional inducements to encour
age enlistments.
It said that men from 17 to 30 in
clusive who volunteer for the regu

prentice 2/c, steward mate 3/c, and
