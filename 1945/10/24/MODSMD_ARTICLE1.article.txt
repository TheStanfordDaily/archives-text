# Campus Units To Sell Bonds
## Groups To Maintain Booth For Week-long War Drive 
### 
Faculty, 8.M.0.C.'5, Navy men from Toyon, and student body officers

These campus personages will have charge of the bond booth in front

8.M.0.C.'s will have charge of the
booth; Friday, tjirls from Casa Ven
tura.
A quota of $50,000 has been set
for the drive. The faculty drive,
coordinated with the Stanford
drive this year, will help in mak
ing the top.
Admission price of $1 worth of
war stamps is the entrance fee set
for the Nov. 2 bond dance in the
Women's Clubhouse. An announce
ment is expected shortly on the or
chestra which is to play at the all
campus function.
A Nov. !> war bond auction
which ends the drive's activities
will offer unusual gifts and prizes
to bond purchases. The commit
tee is attempting to get a big
stir prize article to highlight the
bidding.
At the auction each bid made must
be paid, regardless of whether the
persons bidding win the auctioned
article. The committee has an
nounced that pledges through par
ents can be made to Stanford's part
in the drive. These pledges, to
count, though, must be brought to
the auction.
Master' of Ceremonies at the
auction will be Don Bcchtcr. The
auction will begin at 8 p.m. to
enable persons attending to go to
firesides and dances the same eve
ning.
During the drive, girls in each
University residence will sell stamps
and bonds. Besides this, the bond
booth will be open in front of the
Cellar, and students can also buy
bonds there the night of the auction.
Working on final plans for the
drive are co-chairmen Connie
Johnston and Dcdc Bcgerot. Janic
Sonthcimcr is in charge of the
auction and Greta Siemens is
handling publicity. Gliyla Run
yan and Bcrnice Glcndcnning will
have charge of the bond booth.
This will be the first drive that
Stanford students and faculty have
handled exclusively. Previously the
Palo Alto A.W.V.S. aided the Farm
drive.
Stanford has gone over the bond
top seven times before and will
attempt to make it 100 per cent for
World War II in this eighth and
final drive.
Any students having connections
with corporations arc urged to sec
if they won't pledge their collections
to the Stanford fund.
