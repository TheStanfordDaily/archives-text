## U.S. Beginning To Favor Lower Tariffs—Boggs 
### 
'"American manufacturers in a
number of fields are now beginning
to favor lower tariffs," Theodore H.
Boggs, professor of economics, told
debaters yesterday. "Our mass
production industries can compete
successfully with the rest of the
world and our manufacturers want
markets for their products.
"They are hindered by the pro
tective barriers of other countries;
these barriers presumably will not
be removed until we lower our tar
iffs. Businessmen of solidly Repub
lican sentiment —Mr. Aldrich of the
Chase National Bank, for example—
arc becoming inci'easingly aware
that excessive tariffs act as a hin
drance and not as a stimulus to
business expansion."
Referring to the familiar argu
ment that free trade would cause
our markets to be flooded by for
eign products manufactured in
countries with low wages, Mr.
Boggs pointed out that "high
money wages do not necessarily
mean high unit costs, because
wages must be measured relative
to output.
1 For instance, wt might be paying
ten dollars for a certain kind of
work while an Italian laborer work
ing on a similar product will receive
only two dollars. This leads to
claims that we cannot compete with
the Italian producer and need tar
iffs for protection.
However, it should be considered
that the American worker might
produce twelve units a day, while
the Italian produces only, say, two.
In that case the American manu
facturer is actually in a better posi
tion than the Italian, for his labor
costs por unit are smaller."
It is clear that high wages do
not interfere with foreign trade,
Mr. Boggs said, for America, pay
ing the highest wages of any na
tion, has successfully built up her
exports. Similarly, England dur
ing the nineteenth century con
tinued to export to continental
Europe and Asia, despite paying
higher wages than those preva
lent on the continent and in Asi
atic countries, and despite pur
suing a policy of free trade.
In brief speeches preceding Mr.
Boggs, Lee Falk and Wallace Mc-
Call, Debate Society members, out
lined some of the arguments for
and against free trade. Falk, speak
ing on the affirmative side, main
tained that the United States can
not be prosperous if the rest of the
world is not relatively prosperous.
It is necessary for us to sell abroad,
he said, but we cannot do that with
out buying abroad, for other nations
do not have the money to buy from
us unless we purchase their prod
ucts.
McCall, opposing free trade,
stated that under protective tar
iffs each nation has gained its full
industrial strength, and that we
would suffer if we scaled down
our tariff walls while other coun
tries kept theirs.—George Brunn
