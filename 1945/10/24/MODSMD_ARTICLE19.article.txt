# Dr. Lee Tells of Army Air Corps Experiments, Medical Advancements in Battle Treatments
## 
### 
In the screening of Army mate
rial, in treatment, of battle wounds
and especially in preventative med
icine, military medicine has done a
fine job, Dr. Russel V. A. Lee said
at the Tuesday Series last night, but
neuro-psychiatry has lagged far be
hind in the knowledge of causes and
cures of psychoses.
The marvelous record of the
Medical Corps in the recent war
—12,000 dead of disease out of
!>'•_> million mobilized—was no ac

cident, asserted I)r. Lee, who was
chief of preventative medicine for
the Army Air Corps. "It is a
'simple' matter of preventing the i
transmission of bacteria by any
of these four ways: actual nwitact,
air, food or water, and insects.
The last was the worst in (his
war."
Insect-borne diseases were cut
down in two ways. The individual
could be rendered immune. For ex
ample, Dr. Lee said that not one

case of tetanus was reported dur
ing the war. The second method
was battling the insects. Under Dr.
Lcc's direction the Air Forces' pro
cedure of spreading DDT, the in
secticide, over Pacific Islands has
become commonplace, and he pre
dicts that the control of insects will
completely change the economic
status of that area.
For the Army's screening pro
gram, I)r. Lee, Stanford IVlcdiral
School graduate, said that much
credit can be given to the work
done at Stanford by the psychol
ogy department in individual ap
titude rating.
In the treatment of baltlc wounds
he was impressed with the high
quality of the young medical men
who have been turned out in the
past twenty years. But, "a genera
tion of doctors has been lost by the
non-deferment of medical students
in this war.''
No great medical advances were
made by the military; they had
been made in peacetime, and the
Army merely applied them, in
efficiently and expensively, said
the speaker, who has received tin;
Legion of Merit for his work in
preventative medicine.
Dr. Lee was introduced by Alvin
C. Eurich, academic vice-president
of the University, who said next
week's Series program will be a
madrigal concert given y the
Friends of Music.—Pinkerton
