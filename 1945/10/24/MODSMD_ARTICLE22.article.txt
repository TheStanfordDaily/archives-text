# Play To Open On Thursday
## 'Highland Fling' Settings To Be Elaborate---Sollers 
### 
"A Highland Fling," the fall production of the Stanford Players, which
will open tomorrow evening in the Memorial Auditorium, will have two of
the largest settings ever used on the auditorium stage, according to John
F. Sollers, technical director of the Speech and Drama Department. "The
whole production," Mr. Sollers says, "is extremely well designed, con-

' structed and lighted. Stage crews
are adequate for the first time since
the war, and elaborate stage settings
can once again be planned."
Wendell Cole, Mr. Sollers' assist
ant, designed and supervised the
building of the two sets, which are
a Scotch castle, exterior view, and
a Scotch pub, interior view. The
castle is situated on a hillside, with
unusual angles giving it the per
spective of extending perhaps a
hundred feet down the hill.
The set is colored in tones of
gray, to give the effect of being
haunted. Trees tnd rocks and
grass along the edge of the set
give it realism at the same time.
The second set is that of the in
terior of a pub with a bar, two en
trances, and several tables and
chairs. The walls of this pub, which
is called "The Rose and Thistle,"
are done in a Scotch plaid wall
paper.
The painting technique of the
plaid walls and aged timbers of
the pub was done by the whole
stage crew, which consists of
Jack Taylor, Howard Campbell,
William Patton, Charles Cans,
Newton Arnold, Nina Brae], Pat
Neilson, Barbara Welch, Margery
Walsh, Kollin Buckman, Nadia
Nydegger, Beatrice Callcjo, Mar
garet Fisher, and Courtenay Per
rin. All work done on both sets
would have been hard for even
professional stage crews, and Mr.
\ Cole feels that "it wouldn't have
been possible to do such large,
excellent sets if the stage crew
hadn't been clever, hard workers."

The second set is that of the in
terior of a pub with a bar, two en
trances, and several tables and
chairs. The walls of this pub, which
is called "The Rose and Thistle,"
are done in a Scotch plaid wall
paper.
The painting technique of the
plaid walls and aged timbers of
the pub was done by the whole
stage crew, which consists of
Jack Taylor, Howard Campbell,
William Patton, Charles Cans,
Newton Arnold, Nina Brae], Pat

Nydegger, Beatrice Callcjo, Mar

would have been hard for even
professional stage crews, and Mr.

been possible to do such large,
excellent sets if the stage crew
hadn't been clever, hard workers."

"A Highland Fling," the fall production of the Stanford Players, which
will open tomorrow evening in the Memorial Auditorium, will have two of
the largest settings ever used on the auditorium stage, according to John
F. Sollers, technical director of the Speech and Drama Department. "The
whole production," Mr. Sollers says, "is extremely well designed, con-

' structed and lighted. Stage crews
are adequate for the first time since
the war, and elaborate stage settings
can once again be planned."
Wendell Cole, Mr. Sollers' assist
ant, designed and supervised the
building of the two sets, which are
a Scotch castle, exterior view, and
a Scotch pub, interior view. The
castle is situated on a hillside, with
unusual angles giving it the per
spective of extending perhaps a
hundred feet down the hill.
The set is colored in tones of
gray, to give the effect of being
haunted. Trees tnd rocks and
grass along the edge of the set
give it realism at the same time.
