## ANOTHER POSTWAR PROJECT... 
### 
With the end of the war and the return of
unrationed gasoline, Stanford has seen a flock
of cars descend on the campus this fall. And
with the cars have come a lot of careless, care
free drivers who forget that the streets are not
so empty as they were last spring, and that
Iherf are pedestrians and cyclists who have as
much right to the roads as the automobiles
have.
Stanford's drivers should know this -but it
5s evident that they don't. From all over the
campus have come reports of reckless driving,
absolutely unwarranted in a place where streets
and street signs are well-marked and well
known.
Disregard for the rights of others has been
lampant. One student reported seeing a girl
in a car hit a boy on a bicycle, knock him
flat, and drive on without even stopping ot
ree il he had been hurt. Fortunately the boy
escaped uninjured, but his bike was ruined.
Of course, all the accidents and traffic hazards
on the campus are not due to automobiles
filono. Students on bicycles are as responsible
lor observing street signs and traffic regula
lions are as drivers of cars. By riding on the
wrong side of the street and by disobeying a
"one way" sign, bike riders deliberately en
danger themselves as well as others.
It is ridiculous that Stanford students have
I<> hauled on the carpet and reprimanded
ioi actions that require only good common
sense and consideration to be corrected. Stan
ford car owners can do their part by observ
ing traffic rules and driving carefully; bicycle
jiders can help by having some consideration
for pedestrians and automobiles. Both owe it to
themselves and the University to maintain safe
driving practices here and everywhere else.
