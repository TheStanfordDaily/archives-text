New England has its Blue Book; New York,
San Francisco, and Los Angeles have their
Social Registers, but we here at Stanford have
a Journalistic endeavor which tops them all—
the Stanford Grut Book, the Farm Fiasco, or ac
ademically known as the Bawlout. This little
nifty, containing a multitude of information,
goes on sale this morning in the cashier's office
ior but fifteen cents.
Now, the Bawlout has many ramifications.
It is supposed to include only the essential in
formation concerning faculty members and
students, but the trick is to read between the
]iries.
You must be a bit of a detective in order to
realize the full value of the Bawlout. For ex
ample, let's take a specific case: Little Georgie
Notsosmart eyes a little cutie in his History
class who is just about the berries with him,
but he's afraid to take the gal out for fear she
isn't smart enough for him. You know, not the
.intelligent type. So Georgie buys a Bawlout,

thumbs through it until he comes to her name
-ah, there it is, Hortense Doubleshot. Now,
Georgie finds that Hortense lives in Berke
ley, but Georgie hasn't even heard of Berkeley,
so he goes on to the next line. There he finds
her post office box, her phone number, where
she lives on campus, and her major in college.
Hmrnm, majoring in Cellar Appreciation. Seems
Hortense is taking it on Independent from 3:30
until 6 P.M. each afternoon. Georgie decides
that's her lab work.
Anyhow, he goes on and there he finds what
he's looking for: Hortense's grade average.
Well, she's taken 60 units and is minus 75. A
good, sociable girl with lots on the ball. Just the
intelligent type for me, thinks Georgie, so he
asks her out.
Now that's just the beginning of the story. As
most of you know, the average college man
chases a girl friend until she catches him, and
ultimately college boyfriend marries college
girlfriend. Now Georgie took that into consid
eration and decided it wouldn't be good to start
dating a girl who was too smart for him or too
dumb. It just wouldn't work out. lust think of
all those frustrated chromosomes.
So every student, just like Georgie, should
purchase a Bawlout, read between the lines like
a smart acre, and plan his life accordingly. You
can't go wrong. Why, the Bawlout has every
thing from the above mentioned advantages to
the best bets at Bay Meadows for this season.
Like I said, the Bawlout has so many ramifica
tions. Remember: You ain't in the swing unless
you got that thing. Ouch!

This 1 Can't Stand Dept.—After stumbling into
the Cellar for my 7:45 pre-class coffee the other
morning something happened which complete
ly demoralized me. Sitting in a booth opposite
rne was a bright and cheery group cutting the
cards for their second rubber of bridge. What
was it a marathon from the afternoon before?
★ * *
And now Women's Conference has killed
2:30 late leaves. As one of my colleagues put
it recently: "What would a person do until that
late at night anyhow?" Watch the trains come
in, stupid!
★ * *
Tonight is the last showing of the much
talked-about flick, "You Came Along." Now I
rate movies according to meatballs. One meat
ball is of the Charlie Chan variety, and five
meatballs is the top-notch production. Lizabeth
Scott is worth three meatballs, alone, and the
picture one more, making a total of four. Get
it? As one of the better girls on campus put it
the other day:"lt was a wonderful picture. I
cried from beginning to end." Well, Kleenex
is a lot easier to get now, so buy a carton and
give it a go. It's worth it. The movie I mean;
not the cry . . . See ya.

New England has its Blue Book; New York,
San Francisco, and Los Angeles have their
Social Registers, but we here at Stanford have
a Journalistic endeavor which tops them all—
the Stanford Grut Book, the Farm Fiasco, or ac
ademically known as the Bawlout. This little
nifty, containing a multitude of information,
goes on sale this morning in the cashier's office
ior but fifteen cents.
Now, the Bawlout has many ramifications.
It is supposed to include only the essential in
formation concerning faculty members and
students, but the trick is to read between the
]iries.
You must be a bit of a detective in order to
realize the full value of the Bawlout. For ex
ample, let's take a specific case: Little Georgie
Notsosmart eyes a little cutie in his History
class who is just about the berries with him,
but he's afraid to take the gal out for fear she
isn't smart enough for him. You know, not the
.intelligent type. So Georgie buys a Bawlout,

thumbs through it until he comes to her name
-ah, there it is, Hortense Doubleshot. Now,
Georgie finds that Hortense lives in Berke
ley, but Georgie hasn't even heard of Berkeley,
so he goes on to the next line. There he finds
her post office box, her phone number, where
she lives on campus, and her major in college.
Hmrnm, majoring in Cellar Appreciation. Seems
Hortense is taking it on Independent from 3:30
until 6 P.M. each afternoon. Georgie decides
that's her lab work.
Anyhow, he goes on and there he finds what
he's looking for: Hortense's grade average.
Well, she's taken 60 units and is minus 75. A
good, sociable girl with lots on the ball. Just the
intelligent type for me, thinks Georgie, so he
asks her out.
Now that's just the beginning of the story. As
most of you know, the average college man
chases a girl friend until she catches him, and
ultimately college boyfriend marries college
girlfriend. Now Georgie took that into consid
eration and decided it wouldn't be good to start
dating a girl who was too smart for him or too
dumb. It just wouldn't work out. lust think of
all those frustrated chromosomes.
So every student, just like Georgie, should
purchase a Bawlout, read between the lines like
a smart acre, and plan his life accordingly. You
can't go wrong. Why, the Bawlout has every
thing from the above mentioned advantages to
the best bets at Bay Meadows for this season.
Like I said, the Bawlout has so many ramifica
tions. Remember: You ain't in the swing unless
you got that thing. Ouch!

This 1 Can't Stand Dept.—After stumbling into
the Cellar for my 7:45 pre-class coffee the other

Tonight is the last showing of the much

picture one more, making a total of four. Get
it? As one of the better girls on campus put it
the other day:"lt was a wonderful picture. I
cried from beginning to end." Well, Kleenex

give it a go. It's worth it. The movie I mean;
