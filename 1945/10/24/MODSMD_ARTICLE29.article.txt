French Politics
French politics will be interesting to watch.
The Communist party took the most seats in
the Chamber of Deputies, but the actual figures
on polled votes are not in, and it is thus difficult
to see how much—if any—of a lead it has over
the rest of the French politics.
Yet, even so, the Communist party did not
win the election. It was voted down on the
proposal for retaining the old constitution, and
De Gaulle has the pledged support of the
Catholics and the Socialists, v/hich amounts to
enough seats to block the Communists.
Proletarian Vote
But the thing that is significant is that the Com
munists polled almost ono hundred per cent of
the proletarian vote. The Communist party con
trols the key industries, and this is the basis for
direct action in the Marxian sense.
Now comes the question: How strong is this
control? Do the Marxians have a highly edu
cated, highly disciplined working class sup
port, or have they corue into momentary popu
larity due to the stress of the times?
The Deputies government will have to be a
coalition government, and the coalition will be
split. The Catholics and the Socialists might
form a common bond in beating the Commun
ists, but can they agree on drastic positive ac
tion to propose themselves? If they can't, there
will be the governmental paralysis that caused
so much trouble in Germany and Italy during
the 1920'5.
General Strike?
If the Communists have a strong command
over their votes, they could call a' general strike
and paralyze the country with the shutdown of
its major mines and industries.
They might thy it, and they might fail. The
Swedish Communists didn't have any luck with
this strategy.
But the ascendancy of Communism might not
be the main worry. If labor strife and a para
lyzed government develops, with an unsuccess
ful but strong swing to the left, some sort of
new-named Fascism might arise. This, too, will
have to be a factor to watch in French politics.
