## 
### JACKIE WOOLF 
"With our modern fife extinguish
ers the Stanford Fire Department
can put out a grease fire in an oven
and still leave the dinner roast in
condition good enough to be served,"

explained Fire Chief John M. Mars
ton as he told of the many duties
of the organization.
The fire department is on call at
all times to take care- of fires rang
ing in importance from a smoulder
ing wastebasket to a blazing dormi
tory. The last important fire they
had was the one which demolished
the third floor of Taft Hall last
spring.
Carelessness Causes Fires
"Most of our fires are caused by
careless smoking on the part of the
students," said Mr. Marston.
Stanford's fire department takes
care of 9,000 acres of land and $30,-
000,000 institution, plus nearly 500
homes of faculty members and resi
dents on the campus.
Modern Equipment
"As far as I know, Stanford is the
only private school in the country
that maintains its own fire depart
ment," Mr. Marston stated.
Equipment of the department in
cludes two tank trucks for grass
and brush fires, a modern pumper
which has a tank with a capacity
of 750 gallons, a ladder truck, and
the Fire Chief's car.
Student Firemen
Along with Mr. Marston and a
regular staff of four men, twelve
students help man the trucks and
carry out the work of the depart
ment. With their schedule arranged
so that only six men are on duty
at one time, the students have ev
ery other week off. This permits them
to attend at least half the school
functions which take place on the
week-end.
Quarters in Firehouse
Quarters above the firehouse will
accommodate 15 student firemen, al
though the study room is frequently
so crowded that students who really
wish to study, seek refuge in des
peration in one of the trucks be
low.
In addition to their room, the stu
dent firemen receive $20 a month.
For those who also hash, the prob
lem of room and board expense is
completely solved.

condition good enough to be served,"

explained Fire Chief John M. Mars
ton as he told of the many duties
of the organization.
The fire department is on call at
all times to take care- of fires rang
ing in importance from a smoulder
ing wastebasket to a blazing dormi
tory. The last important fire they
had was the one which demolished
the third floor of Taft Hall last
spring.
Carelessness Causes Fires
"Most of our fires are caused by
careless smoking on the part of the
students," said Mr. Marston.
Stanford's fire department takes
care of 9,000 acres of land and $30,-
000,000 institution, plus nearly 500
homes of faculty members and resi
dents on the campus.
Modern Equipment
"As far as I know, Stanford is the
only private school in the country
that maintains its own fire depart
ment," Mr. Marston stated.
Equipment of the department in
cludes two tank trucks for grass
and brush fires, a modern pumper
which has a tank with a capacity
of 750 gallons, a ladder truck, and
the Fire Chief's car.
Student Firemen
Along with Mr. Marston and a
regular staff of four men, twelve
students help man the trucks and
carry out the work of the depart
ment. With their schedule arranged
so that only six men are on duty
at one time, the students have ev
ery other week off. This permits them
to attend at least half the school
functions which take place on the
week-end.
Quarters in Firehouse
Quarters above the firehouse will
accommodate 15 student firemen, al
though the study room is frequently
so crowded that students who really
wish to study, seek refuge in des
peration in one of the trucks be
low.
In addition to their room, the stu
dent firemen receive $20 a month.
For those who also hash, the prob
lem of room and board expense is
completely solved.
