# Dibble's Blind Learn Dancing
## 
### 
Army busses will pick up the sec
ond group of girls for the dancing
class with blind vets from Dibble
at 7:15 tonight in front of the Wom
en's Gym.
The girls, who have volunteered
from the modern dance classes of
Miriam Lidster, will assist her in
teaching blind boys from Dibble to
dance. This dance instruction is
twofold in purpose; to teach boys
to dance who have never known
how, and to teach those who have
not danced since they were blinded.
According to Mrs. Lidster the groups
are kept small to make them easier
to teach.
The classes are conducted in the
Women's Clubhouse in Palo Alto
from 7:30 to 9:30 every Wednesday
night. The girls are furnished trans
portation both ways and will be back
on campus before 10.
"Any girls interested in going
should see me at once," concluded
Mrs. Lidster.
