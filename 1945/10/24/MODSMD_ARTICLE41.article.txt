# Dr. Wells Tells of Work In Speech Correction
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
One of the first attempts in the
United States to help in the speech
training of cleft-palate children was,
in part, organized by one of Stan
ford's new assisting professors in
the Speech and Drama Department,
Dr. Charlotte G. Wells, a former
member of the teaching staff of Mt.
Holyoke College.
"During eight weeks of the sum
mer," Dr. Wells related, "cleft
palate children from all over the
state of Wisconsin were boarded in
Madison near our experimental
speech center. All these children
had undergone surgery but were
unable to speak correctly. Here,
where we had use of the best ortho
pedic facilities, the staff worked with
youngsters in regular daily train
ing. For three summers our center
was purely experimental, but now
Wisconsin is officially setting it up."
Although Dr. Wells taught high
school dramatics in Nebraska and
acted many character roles with
the University of Wisconsin Play
ers, her main interest has always
been speech correction, especial
ly as far as the training of teach
ers for this field is concerned. At
Stanford Miss Wells hopes in her
association with the Speech Clinic
to help provide opportunities for
those interested in a teaching ca
reer in speech correction.
The part of radio in dramatics
has also appealed to Dr. Wells.
"Courses in dramatics and radio en
able the student to be a better user
of both," she contended. "He will
be trained to more fully enjoy their
offerings whether or not he plans to
turn to the professional side of this
field."

In comparing Mt. Holyoke, a wom
en's college, to co-educational Stan
ford, Dr. Wells pointed out the ad
vantages of both types. "A women's
college provides excellent training
and fine standards for a girl, but a
co-educational university will prob
ably give a woman more profes
sional training and a broader and
more liberal background, especially
socially," stated Dr. Wells. She
pointed out that the girls at Ml.
Holyoke were terribly handicaped
socially during the war, for although
many of the leading mens' uni
versities are near by, they were
practically deserted for the duration.
"The mode of dress in a wom
an's college is decidedly more
casual than at a co-educational
university," Dr. Wells replied.
"Having no incentive to look well
groomed. Mt. Holyoke girls at
tended classes in dungarees, slop
py /shirts, and bandanas." She
admitted that she much preferred
the attire of Stanford women.
"Although (he girls of the two
universities difl'er in campus
clothes, their interests, sincerity,
and enthusiasm for everything are
fundamentally the same."
The little leisure time afforded
(his active professor is spent read
ing books of every variety. "I must
admit," concluded Dr. Wells, "that
nothing exciting has happened to
m°, but everything I've done I've
enjoyed, and I suppose that's all
that really matters."

tended classes in dungarees, slop
py /shirts, and bandanas." She
admitted that she much preferred
the attire of Stanford women.
"Although (he girls of the two
universities difl'er in campus
clothes, their interests, sincerity,
and enthusiasm for everything are
fundamentally the same."
The little leisure time afforded
(his active professor is spent read
ing books of every variety. "I must
admit," concluded Dr. Wells, "that
nothing exciting has happened to
m°, but everything I've done I've
enjoyed, and I suppose that's all
that really matters."
One of the first attempts in the
United States to help in the speech
training of cleft-palate children was,
in part, organized by one of Stan
ford's new assisting professors in
the Speech and Drama Department,
Dr. Charlotte G. Wells, a former
member of the teaching staff of Mt.
Holyoke College.
"During eight weeks of the sum
mer," Dr. Wells related, "cleft
palate children from all over the
state of Wisconsin were boarded in
Madison near our experimental
speech center. All these children
had undergone surgery but were
unable to speak correctly. Here,
where we had use of the best ortho
pedic facilities, the staff worked with
youngsters in regular daily train
ing. For three summers our center
was purely experimental, but now
Wisconsin is officially setting it up."
Although Dr. Wells taught high
school dramatics in Nebraska and
acted many character roles with
the University of Wisconsin Play
ers, her main interest has always
been speech correction, especial
ly as far as the training of teach
ers for this field is concerned. At
Stanford Miss Wells hopes in her
association with the Speech Clinic
to help provide opportunities for
those interested in a teaching ca
reer in speech correction.
The part of radio in dramatics
has also appealed to Dr. Wells.
"Courses in dramatics and radio en
able the student to be a better user
of both," she contended. "He will
be trained to more fully enjoy their
offerings whether or not he plans to
turn to the professional side of this
field."

In comparing Mt. Holyoke, a wom
en's college, to co-educational Stan
ford, Dr. Wells pointed out the ad
vantages of both types. "A women's
college provides excellent training
and fine standards for a girl, but a
co-educational university will prob
ably give a woman more profes
sional training and a broader and
more liberal background, especially
socially," stated Dr. Wells. She
pointed out that the girls at Ml.
Holyoke were terribly handicaped
socially during the war, for although
many of the leading mens' uni
versities are near by, they were
practically deserted for the duration.
"The mode of dress in a wom
an's college is decidedly more
casual than at a co-educational
university," Dr. Wells replied.
"Having no incentive to look well
groomed. Mt. Holyoke girls at
tended classes in dungarees, slop
py /shirts, and bandanas." She
admitted that she much preferred
