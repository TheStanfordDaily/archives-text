"Off to the races!" is the call to sports fans in the Bay Area
this week as Bay Meadows, the local horse-racing track, opened
iis turnstiles "to the lovers of fine horses" for a 47-day meeting.
This year's opening was preceded by a successful experi
ment in a new method of transportation for horses. Two horses
were transported from- Hollywood Park, which is located near
Los Angeles, to the front door of Bay Meadows by air. The
experiment was carried out under the guidance of Bill Kyne,
owner of Bay Meadows, and the biggest of cargo planes was
used to do the job. The plane left the south at 9:30 a.m., and
arrived at Bay Meadows two hours and forty minutes later with
the horses no worse for the trip. The two horses transported,
El Lobl and Feather Foot, were the first thoroughbreds ever to
take to the air.
Kyne's experiment will undoubtedly revolutionize racing in
the U.S., and for that matter throughout the world. It will now
be possible to transport horses from tracks in the East to the
West Coast overnight. It will probably be possible also to enter
American horses in races abroad and vice versa.
ST. MARY'S STAR LINESMAN OUT
St. Mary's received their first bad break of the season when
Harvey Adair, Gael tackle, was injured in the game against
McClellan Field last Sunday. How long young Adair will be
out is not yet known. It may be for just a couple of weeks, and
then again it may be for the whole season. No matter what, he
won't be in there when the kids from Moraga come up against
El Trojan a week from Saturday.
The loss of Adair, the strongest man in the line, may make a
difference as to the outcome of the remaining part of the season
as far as the Gaels are concerned. St. Mary's is in a position
where it can't afford to lose any first-string men because past
the first eleven the ranks become rather thin. Coach Jimmy
Phelan has announced that Ed Houston, a Los Angeles boy, will
take Adair's place in the game against Southern Cal, Novem
ber 3.
CAL MAY GET DUMPED BY WOLVES
California's Golden Bears may get a bit tarnished again this
Saturday when they come up against the University of Nevada
squad. The Cal team, which had rested all last week, came back
to renew practice minus a good number of players, notably
Billy Agnew.
Besides Agnew Cal is losing Bob Gray, a reserve quarter
back, who was transferred by the Navy, and Bob Edmonston
who was first-string right half at the start of the season. There
is also a possibility that a few of the players may become in
eligible when the grades for last semester are calculated. With
all these gaps in the Cal team, we wouldn't be surprised if the
Bears went down to defeat at the hands of the Wolves.
