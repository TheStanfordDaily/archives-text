### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
As the familiar strains of "Take
the 'A' Train" drifted over the
hushed audience, the curtains parted,
and Duke Ellington v/as once again
to captivate thousands with his mu
sical genius. Born Edward Ken
nedy Ellington, the Duke stands as
one of the greatest figures in jazz
history.
His ability to look ahead and play
ahead of his time has been only one
of the factors which has kept the
Duke the "King" in eyes and ears
of swing enthusiasts. As the great
est arranger in swingdom, as proved
by all-star polls and by his music,
Ellington has consistently main
tained a standard that young aspir
ants to success strive to attain.
As a composer, Duke's tunes
speak for themselves. "Mood In
digo." "I Let A Song Go Out of
My Heart," "I Got It Bad and
That Ain't Good," "I)o Nothin'
Till You Hear from Me." "Don't
Get Around Much Anymore,"
"I'm Beginning To See the Light,"
"Don't You Know I Care," "In My
Solitude," "Everything But You,"
and so many have come from the
Ellington pen.
With teamwork as the keystone
in the success of his organization,
the Duke has succeeded in spon
soring some of the finest individual
artists in the jazz kingdom. While
ether bands have jumped on and off
the swing scene, this crew still reads
like an all-star aggregation.
With alto-saxman Johnny Hodges
hading the rocking reed section
basically composed of Harry Carney,
Jimmy Hamilton, A 1 Sears, and Otto
Hardwick; Ellington has formed a
section that is not easily topped.
Well-stocked in brass, the band has
such greats as Rex Stewart, Taft
Jordan, and Ray Nance on trumpets;
and Lawrcnce Brown and Joe
"Tricky Sam" Nanton on trombones.
With Sonny Greer and Junior
Kaolin driving the group from
behind, this unit has swelled the
Victor Record Company's treas
ury with such dynamic discs as
"The 'C' Jam Blues" "Perdido,"
and "UifT Stacato."
With A 1 Hibbler and Joya Sherrill
sharing the vocal spotlight, the sing
ing chores are well taken care of.
Succeeding Herb "Flamingo" Jef
fries and Ivie Anderson, these two
plus the voice of Ray" Nance once
again demonstrate Ellington's ability
to uncover new talent. Another in
stance of this can be cited in the
case of Billy Strayhorn whose ar
ranging and composing is second on
ly to his teacher, the good Duke
Ellington.
Not all of the Ellingtonia greats
are with the band at present.
Trumpeter Cootie Williams, Clarinet
ist Barney Bigard, Trombonist Juan
Tizol. and Tenor Sax-man Ben
Webster are all well established
Duke alumni.
Because of its superb artistry,
the Ellington orchestra has had
many singular honors awarded it.

It has been selected year after
year by the people through Met
ronome Magazine and by the crit
ics through Esquire Magazine as
the outstanding jazz organization
nl its time.
This group is the only group of
its kind to present regularly sched
uled concerts in Carnegie Hall. As
long as musicians of Duke Elling
ton's calibre continue to lead the
swing field, there need be no fears
concerning the extinction of the jazz
idiom.
