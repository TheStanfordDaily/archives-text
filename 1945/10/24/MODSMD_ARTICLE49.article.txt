# Many Forfeits In Mural Play
## 
### 
Forfeits were pretty much the
rule in yesterday's intramural foot
ball games as only three of the nine
scheduled contests were actually
played. In those three tussles, lop
sided scores were the result, with
Medics A downing Encina 111, 25-0,
in League I, Encina II trouncing
Cleveland, 32-0, in League 11, and
Army walloping Encina IV in League
111.
Default decisions were handed to
the BBC Fills over the Chinese
Club and Pierce over Van Buren in
League I, the Hilltoppers over the
Firehouse in League 11. and Medics
111 over Phi Psi and Taft over Hayes
in League 111. No result was avail
able at press time on the Encina
I-Jefferson match in League 11.
None of the three games played
had much bearing on the title races
in the three circuits. Encina 11,
deadlocked with the Hilltoppers at
the top of League 11, showed their
strongest offensive power of the
season but will still be definite un
derdogs in their crucial tussle with
the Tyler-Arthur boys next Tues
day. The Encinans, in handing
Cleveland their third loss of the
year, rolled up 23 points in the
first half to completely overwhelm
their opposition and then coasted
to an easy triumph. The running
of Ray Winterhalter and the passing
of Dave Wheeler were main factors
in the Encina win.
The Medics, making a strong bid
for second place in League I after
incurring a 21-0 loss at the hands
of the league-leading Kappa-Dee
Gee Hashers in the first game of the
season, continued to roll up impres
sive scores by their decisive whip
ping of Encina 111, and the soldier
sextet, still tied for first in League
111,, had an equally easy time with
Encina IV.
With several of the weaker teams
dropping out of the league, interest
is now mainly centered on the Hill
topper-Encina II title clash in League
II and the Army-Medics 111 scuffle
for the championship of the No. 3
league.
