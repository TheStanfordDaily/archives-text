# Auto Plants Try To Avert Strikes

### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 23 (UP).—Hopes
thai serious labor strikes could be
averted in the automobile industry
were buoyed tonight by a Ford
Motor Company statement that it
believed "solutions can be found
for the problems facing us."
The statement, attributed to Hen
ry Ford 11, president of Ford, came
as preparations were being com
pleted by the National Labor Rela
tions Board for a strike vote to
morrow among 325.000 General Mo
tors Corporation employees. It also
came as negotiations were dead
locked between General Motors
and the United Automobile Work
ers (CIO) over the union's demand
for a 30 per cent pay increase.
Development Forecast
A major labor development was
the forecast by a high American
Federation of Labor official that
John L. Lewis and his United Mine
Workers would be back in the AFL
by next January. Lewis left the
AFL in 1936 when he bolted to
found the Committee for Industrial
Organization, which later became
the powerful Congress of Industrial
Organizations.
The AFL Executive Council,
meeting in Cincinnati, ordered rep
resentatives of all unions involved
in the movie industry jurisdictional
dispute to appear before it tomor

row. Appearing for the industry
will be film czar Eric Johnston.
More Movie Strikes
Violence broke out again in the
movie dispute when 200 non-strik
ing employees attacked an AFL
picket line in an effort to get into
Paramount Studio. Some 40 men
broke through the 350 pickets. A
policeman was hurt during the brief
fight. Several pickets were arrested.
The automobile labor situation
was matched in seriousness by a
similar deadlock in the steel indus
try. U.S. Steel Corporation an
nounced in Pittsburgh that it had
rejected the demands of another
CIO union—the United Steel Work
ers of America—tor a fiat $2 a day
wage increase.
