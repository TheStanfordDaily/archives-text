"Many people do not like cubistic
art, because they do not understand
it," explained Professor Edward M.
Farmer, speaking of some of the
pictures now on exhibit at the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal
lery, "It is as if these artists were
speaking in a new and more ex
pressive language, but one in which
the words have no meaning to most
people. The cubists aften try to
show an object from more than one
point of view by superimposing the
outstanding planes into one harmon
ious design. The simplification of
form as it is seen in cubism is not
a new ideaâ€”it wag an outstanding
feature of art as early as Egyptian
times.
Mechanical Motion In Art
"One of the developments of
cubism is the expression of me
chanical motion in art," Mr. Farmer
continued. "This trend was partic
ularly notable in Italy where it ex
pressed the dynamic energy behind
the political Fascism of cubism re
lated to this type in the show is
the painting by Leger. In it, how
ever, he is primarily interested in
expressing the mechanical forms of
modern machines rather than the
dynamic movement.
"An even more modern develop
ment than cubism is displayed in
'La Cruche Fluerie' by Picasso. The

picture, composed in 1937, is one
of his later works. In it Picasso
indicates the essence of his sub
ject by exaggerating the charac
teristics of the object." Mr. Farmer
pointed out that it has much more
grace and delicacy than his earlier
efforts in the cubistic field.
Van Gogh Paintings
According to Mr. Farmer the Gal
lery is fortunate to have an espe
cially well-preserved example of
Van Gogh's painting, "Les Maisons
Blanches," in the exhibit. It shows
through its vibrant colors the in
tensified feeling which Van Gogh
had for the physical world. Be
cause he sometimes used inferior
pigments many of Van Gogh's pic
tures are fading so that much of
their original vigor is lost, he ad
ded.
"In feeling, Gaughin, whose paint
ings 'Flowers in a Vase," is in the
display, is very close to Van Gogh.
Gaughin's oils are perhaps more
rich and more emotional than Van
Gogh's, but he too uses bright col
ors and simple designs," commented
Mr. Farmer. "He particularly liked
the tropics and much of his work
has tropical life as its subject.
Influence of Cubism
"'Portrait Study' and 'Femme Au
Chapeau Bleu' show the developT
ment in the style of Matisse. 'Por
trait Study,' which is the earlier

of the two, shows the influence of
cubism and is similar to some of
the work of Cezanne. 'Femme A
Chapeau Bleu' displays a richness
of color and design characteristic
of the later paintings by Matisse."
Mr. Farmer said that perhaps the
most familiar group shown in the
exhibition was the impressionistic
group. "Harbor, Dieppe" by Pissarro
shows well how the impressionist
achieves the desired effect through
the use of well placed spots of
color. Instead of a house and a
roof, for instance, he paints a spot
of white with a blue spot above it
to create the visual impression of a
house.
Farmer's Favorite
One of Mr. Farmers' favorites in
the exhibit is "Tulip in a Green
Bowl" by Redon. He feels that the
painting is beautiful in its simplicity
and sensitivity to atmosphere and
shows a discreetness which contrasts
sharply with many of the other pic
tures on display.
The exhibit will be open until
Sunday, October 28, from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m., and daily, 1 to 5 p.m.
