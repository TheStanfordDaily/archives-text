# One Year Military Training for All Young Men Recommended by Truman
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 (UP).—
Here is how the system of military
training recommended by President
Truman would operate:
Every young man, except those
who were totally disqualified physi
cally, would receive one year of
military training as a civilian.
He would begin training at the
age of 18 or upon graduation from
high school, whichever is later. He
would begin in any event before his
20th birthday. If he completed high
school before his 18th birthday, he
could enroll with parental consent.
Six Years in Reserve
At the end of the training pe
riod, he would become a member
of the general reserve for six years.
After that, he would be placed in
a secondary reserve.
N« Exemptions Allowed
Trainees would not be members
of the armed forces. They would be
civilians in training. Special regula
tions would have to be drawn up for

their organization, discipline and
welfare.
No exemptions would be allowed
for occupation, dependency or any
other reason except total physical
disqualification.
If, after a few months' training,
a man was not physically qualified
for military service he could be
trained in certain skills that could
be used during wartime in ship
yards, munitions factories and other
production work.
Commissions Possible
After completing a year of mili
tary training, a man could be
granted a commission if he took ad
ditional instruction in officer candi
date school, the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps, or Naval Reserve
Officers' Training Corps.

Outstanding trainees could be
sent to college with government fi
nancial aid. They would be re
quired to take R.O.T.C. training at
college and to return after gradua
tion for a year's additional training
as junior officers.
