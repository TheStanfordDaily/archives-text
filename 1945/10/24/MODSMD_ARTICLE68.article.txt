# Soviet Talk By Cressey
## 
### 
Since Russia is a self-sufficient
and self-contained continental coun
try, she is not likely to enter the
field of foreign trade on a large
scale or become a competitor of
the United States, according to
George B. Cressey, visiting profes
sor at the Stanford School of Hu
manities.
In a talk Monday night to the
American Russian Institute in San
Francisco, he expressed the opinion
that the Soviet will be too occupied
with its growing economy at home
to venture into foreign trade for a
long time.
Mr. Cressey stressed the fact that
only one-eighth of Russia's 8,000,-
000 square miles is habitable land.
The greater part of the country is
either too cold, too dry, or too
mountainous to be attractive to in
tensive human habitation.
Russia has large mineral resources,
including coal, oil, and iron, said
Mr. Cressey, which make it possible
for tiie country to be a great in
dusi.ial power.
