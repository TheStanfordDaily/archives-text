# Geology Display Features Shells
## 
### CAROL VAN DEN BERG 
"She saves sea shells on the third
floor." An interesting collection of
shells has been on exhibit in the
Geology building for many years,
yet very few students have seen it.
Many of the priceless shells are
about sixty million years old, while
others are so valuable that they are
kept under lock and key. Current
ly, Miss Myra Keen is in charge of
the display.
Intricacy of Shells
"Shells have a tendency to be
come more intricate as the world

advances, said Miss Keen. "The tex
ture of the shells depends on tho
temperature of the surrounding
water; warmer climates help to de
velop colorful and dolicate appear
ing shells." This explains the sim
ilarity between shells of the North
ern Hemisphere.
Included in the collection are some
beautiful snail shells. Contrary to
the garden snail, the water snail is
a cannibal of the sea. It has two
rasping organs in its mouth that
slowly grind holes in unsuspecting
clams.
Old Collection
Dr. J. P. Smith, first professor of
Paleontology, started the shell col
lection shortly after the University
was founded, and ever since, the
collection has been steadily built
up. A priceless group of shells that
were the actual examples used to
illustrate certain species in books
are kept in a special cabinet.
The latest collection is shells sent
to Miss Keen from many of the
Pacific Islands.
The exhibition is open everyday
to students and visitors.
