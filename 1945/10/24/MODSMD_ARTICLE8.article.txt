# Toyon, Branner Plan Spook Party Friday
## 
### 
Toyon Navymen have announced that their lobby will be studded with
tombstones and intricate mazes Friday from 9 to 11:30, when Branner
and Toyon will sponsor a closed Halloween party.
Bob Long, Toyon social chairman, pointed out that this will be "more
or less a coming out party" for Stanford's fleet, since this is the first social

activity they've been connected with
as a unit. Party committees from
the two dorms will work together.
"This is going to be strictly in
formal," Long said, "with fortune
tellings, apple ducking, and other
weird Halloween games that we
haven't quite 'scared up' yet."
Jeans in Order
There will be dancing, Long ad
ded, but nothing less strenuous than
a Virginia Reel or Paul Jones. Mi s,
Miriam Lidstcr will call for the
square dancing.
Cathy Morris, Branner social
chairman, has emphasized the fact
that informal clothes should be
worn. "Jeans or a ragged cotton
dress will do," pointed out Miss
Morris, "but don't wear anything
that won't be able to stand up
through a trip through the maze,
or possibly a swim in the apple
ducking barrel."
