# Professor Guerard Voices Approval Of New French Leftist Government
## 
### 
"I heartily approve of the results
of the recent French election," Pro
fessor Albert Guerard told mem
bers of the League of Women Vot
ers at a meeting yesterday afternoon
in the Palo Alto Women's Club
house.
The noted French historian added
that the French vote would have
swung left in spite of the sabotaged
regime of the Third Republic and
the years of world conflict.
Mr. Guerard, professor of gen
eral literature at Stanford Uni
versity, pointed out that the
French people realized that they
have been living under a collec
tivist system (whether for the
advantage of a few or for many)
since the Industrial Revolution.
"The French know that public
utilities, large, essential industries,
and natural resources belong to the
people, not to a few," Mr. Guerard
said. Personal private property and
the luxury industries will still re
main in private hands, but "private
initiative has been released by this
social revolution," he said.
In giving the results of the French
election, Mr. Guerard listed as most
important the fall of the Third Re
public. the defeat of the conserva
tive party, and the o'ownfall of pro
fessional politicians as Americans
know them.
"The Third Republic is dead and
gone," Mr. Guerard said. "France
has gone socialist b.v about 75 per
cent." He added that the French

j realize thai government minus
(he control of party politics is nec
essary for the good of the whole
country.
Mr. Guerard laid particular stress
; on the fact that the defeat of the
j Third Republic did not mean con-
I demnation of its regime by tlu
| French people. On the whole the

70-year reign of that regime has
been a creditable period in French
history, he claimed.
The historian pointed out that the
extension of the French empire, ex
cellent social legislation, the suc
cessful conclusion of World War I,
and the fostering of liberal ideals
within the nation, have been a few
of the highlights of that period.
"The fact that the Nazis won
docs not prove that their govern
ment is superior to France's," Mr.
Guerard said. He added that
France fell because she was ex
posed while England was pro
tected by the Channel and the
United States by an ocean. "Fos
silized military thought also con
tributed its share to defeat," he
said.
In considering the France of the
future, Mr. Guerard remarked that
France was looking forward, not to
a continuation of the old empire,
but to a new French Federation of
Nations. "Under such a system," he
said, "all subject nations would be
on an equal footing to continue their
traditions and culture. From a lib
eral point of view," he stated, "this
would be a better solution for the
Indo-China problem, than turning
that country over to a handful of
absolute nationalists."
In conclusion, Mr. Guerard
urged that France be recognized,
not as a dead nation, but as a liv
ing nation with hopes and ideals
of a strong and united Europe.â€”
