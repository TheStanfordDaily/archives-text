# BIG THREE CONFERENCE
## 
### 
j LONDON, Oct. 24 (UP).â€”Assistant
i Secretary of States James C. Dunn
and his aides are working hard here
in hope that the conference of for
eign ministers may be resumed
soon, it was learned today, but diplo
matic quarters believed that the out
look was gloomy.
If anything, the Big Three powers
seemed farther apart than when the
previous conference collapsed Oct.
2. The most recent indication was
the dispatch by the United States
and Great Britain of representations
against a proposed Russian-Hungar
ian trade pact.
