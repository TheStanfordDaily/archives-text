# Dr. Starr Gives Talk
## 
### 
Dr. Mortimer Starr, a National
Research Club Fellow, spoke on the
"Recent Developments in the Physi
ology and Biochemistry of Phyto
pathogenic Bacteria" at the weekly
seminar of the Biological Sciences
Department yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Starr, who has been on leave
from Brooklyn College for the past
two years, is now working at the
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove on the classification of these
disease - producing organisms of
plants.
This noted bacteiologist revealed
that many millions of dollars have
been spent in attempts to combat
these micro-organisms, and that al
most every type of plant may be
infected with them.
Because of their similarity to
fungi, these bacteia have not been
studied by bacteriologists but by
experts in the field of fungi. This
has resulted in a confusion between
the two oganisms. Dr. Starr has
been experimenting successfully to
classify the phytopathogenic bacte
ria by their growing conditions rfnd
the food which they thrive on.
Dr. Robert Bacon of the Depart
ment of Anatomy will speak on the
subject, of "Experiments on the
Heart and Amphibian Embryos" at
next Wednesday's seminar. On the
following Friday, Dr. Theodore
Roughlyc will show colored films
of the fisheries of Australia to il
lustrate his discussion.
