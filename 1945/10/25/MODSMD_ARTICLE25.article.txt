MILITARY TRAINING-A MUST
Before a Congress which has remained noncommittal on
most matters of primary importance, but whose Senate has
managed to agree on the celebration of the 25th anniversary
of women's suffrage, President Truman on Tuesday called for
a! year's specialized military training for American men 17 to
20 years of age.
According to the President, this measure is necessary to
insure the United States of "superiority on land and sea and in
the air." He stated that only by strength can we impress the
1 act upon future aggressors that we will tolerate no threat to
peace or liberty.
Main points of the general program which the President
suggested are these:
A military organization including a regular Army, Navy, and
Marine Corps; a strengthened National Guard and organized
leserve for all the services; and a general reserve composed
of all the male citizens of the United States who have received
training.
The general reserve could only be called upon by selective
service procedures through an act of Congress. All young men
except those physically unfit would receive the training either
El the age of 18 or at their graduation from high school, which
ever is later.
Truman assured Congress that the training could be as spe
cialized as possible, in order to benefit men for their peacetime
occupations as well as to give them military instruction. Com
missions would be granted to qualified men who wished to be
come officers of the regular service.
Opposition to and modifications of the President's proposal
came from varied sources, with Congress divided, but not
strictly along party lines. Representative Joseph P. Martin, Re
publican house leader, made a counter-proposal for an inter
national agreement to abolish peacetime conscription as a
policy among nations to "reduce incentive to war and save bil
lions which could be better diverted toward making a better
world for the great masses of people everywhere."
Democratic Senator McCarren said that he read in the Presi
dents message the prelude to militarism in the United States,
while Republican Senator Taft commented that Truman had
"wholly failed to show that huge reserves of 7,000,000 half
trained men are of any real value to national defense."
The essential issue seems to have been left clouded and
undiscussed, despite the definite stands taken on sidelights of
the matter. To us that essential issue is whether or not universal
miliiary training will serve to keep the peace in a united world.
When it becomes clear that we can only escape catastrophe in
the future by putting our faith in a strong and sovereign world
organization such as has not yet been established, we see that
issues such as that of military training must be judged in rela
tion to that hoped-for organization.
Casting sentimentality, lazy and wishful thinking aside, we
necessarily conclude that a contribution of strength and reserve
force from the United States might become the base on which
world security is built. If a peacetime military program will
forward this aim, we endorse it.窶年. S.

cialized as possible, in order to benefit men for their peacetime
occupations as well as to give them military instruction. Com
missions would be granted to qualified men who wished to be
come officers of the regular service.
Opposition to and modifications of the President's proposal
came from varied sources, with Congress divided, but not
strictly along party lines. Representative Joseph P. Martin, Re
publican house leader, made a counter-proposal for an inter
national agreement to abolish peacetime conscription as a
policy among nations to "reduce incentive to war and save bil
lions which could be better diverted toward making a better
world for the great masses of people everywhere."
Democratic Senator McCarren said that he read in the Presi
dents message the prelude to militarism in the United States,
while Republican Senator Taft commented that Truman had
"wholly failed to show that huge reserves of 7,000,000 half
trained men are of any real value to national defense."
The essential issue seems to have been left clouded and
undiscussed, despite the definite stands taken on sidelights of
the matter. To us that essential issue is whether or not universal
miliiary training will serve to keep the peace in a united world.
When it becomes clear that we can only escape catastrophe in
the future by putting our faith in a strong and sovereign world
organization such as has not yet been established, we see that
issues such as that of military training must be judged in rela
tion to that hoped-for organization.
Casting sentimentality, lazy and wishful thinking aside, we
necessarily conclude that a contribution of strength and reserve
force from the United States might become the base on which
world security is built. If a peacetime military program will
forward this aim, we endorse it.窶年. S.
MILITARY TRAINING-A MUST
Before a Congress which has remained noncommittal on
most matters of primary importance, but whose Senate has
managed to agree on the celebration of the 25th anniversary
of women's suffrage, President Truman on Tuesday called for
a! year's specialized military training for American men 17 to
20 years of age.
According to the President, this measure is necessary to
insure the United States of "superiority on land and sea and in
the air." He stated that only by strength can we impress the
1 act upon future aggressors that we will tolerate no threat to
peace or liberty.
Main points of the general program which the President
suggested are these:
A military organization including a regular Army, Navy, and
Marine Corps; a strengthened National Guard and organized
leserve for all the services; and a general reserve composed
of all the male citizens of the United States who have received
training.
The general reserve could only be called upon by selective
service procedures through an act of Congress. All young men
except those physically unfit would receive the training either
El the age of 18 or at their graduation from high school, which
ever is later.
Truman assured Congress that the training could be as spe
cialized as possible, in order to benefit men for their peacetime
occupations as well as to give them military instruction. Com
missions would be granted to qualified men who wished to be
come officers of the regular service.
