# HISTORY-1945

### ELLIOT EPSTEEN Elliot Epsteen 
Nations that have been facing
guns throughout their history,
whether they be democratic or
tyrannical in organization, have de
v"loped national armies. Although
this process might have contributed
to wars, it also made for security,
and the real seeds of conflict might
not have been laid so much by the
i •r.labl i: ;h men ts-a t-arms that each
state was building but the coupling
«>l them with an aggressive foreign
policy.
Then the last war came, and its
terrific cost caused a general reac
tion to all the normal methods of
conducting diplomacy. The machine
gun and trench lice did more for
pacifism than a million hollow ora
tor. The result was an aversion to
anything resembling large army ap
propriations. Conscription was beat
en again and again in England and
America, and French army budgets
were curtailed right and left. The
result of Ihe latter was that ancient
r is's were matched against highly
accurate, modern 88's in 1940, and
the results are known to the world.
ARGUMENT
The question of "if we abandon
arms, will we build a more perma
nent. peace than if we keep them?"
was fought out thoroughly in the
twenties and thirties, and the side
in favor of giving them up won.
The result was this war. Three
third-rate national entities that
shouldn't have amounted to any
thing built up their position by
building gun after gun when the
vest of the world was talking re
ligion and disarmament ratios. The
net result was that these nations
finally felt secure enough to attack
the world, and they almost succeed
ed.
Thus, the argument should be
finally ended. We have learned the
pricc of disarmament, but still there
are senators in Washington who
issued press statements after Presi

dent Truman's address, and they
still thought that peace could be
maintained by simply writing the
right words on a United Nations
Charter.
Of course, there are other argu
ments in favor of putting down a
peacetime training bill. The main
ones are that, first, our geographic
position will allow us to gain time so
that we don't have to pass this thing
until it's absolutely necessary, and
second, the atomic bomb relegates
large armies to the scrap heap.
ANSWERS
Such a prosaic thing as kerosene
ruins the first argument. It will be
able to take giant, jet-propelled
transports over the Great Northern
Route and land their contents on
American soil. If there is another
European or Asiatic war, we might
be under the guns just as much as
the nation nearest the aggressor. For
that reason, we cannot be weak.
As for the atomic bomb, the dup
lication of our industry underground
would turn it into a terrorist
weapon, and not a decisive one.
That would put war back in the
hands of large armies. Of course,
it can be argued that this might
not necessarily happen, but the
wisest national policy is the one
that plans against all eventualities,
and for this reason, we should have
a large citizen army ready for the
opening of hostilities.
TRUMAN PLAN
In light of this, the arguments
against Truman's plan are not that
it goes too far, but that it docs not
go far enough. It has no provision
for recruiting officers from the citi
zen ranks, and the lack of them
might prove a weakness. It also
holds no provision for mobilizing all
industry when war breaks out, and
industry is the basis of a war effort.
However, if the light of sanity
should prevail in the Senate, we will
find that these are kinks, and little
more, which can be worked out.
