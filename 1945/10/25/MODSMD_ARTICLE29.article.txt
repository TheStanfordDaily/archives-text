# Disabled Vets' Program Aims at Rehabilitation
## 
### 
Among Stanford's 300-odd veter
ans, 61 are enrolled under the dis
abled veterans' training program,
aiming at physical rehabilitation
and vocational aptitude in a mini
mum space of time. Robert S. Raven,
Sr., Veterans' Coordinator ;*nd gov
ernment representative, is training
officer of the program at the Farm.
Guaranteed up to 48 months of
schooling at government expense,
these men have set up, upon con
ference with the training officer, cer
tain objectives in vocational abilities
—their aim is not merely to receive
the AB degree, but to acquire,
quickly but thoroughly, the neces
sary skill to be called "a journalist,"
or "a personnel director," or "an
engineer." Their objectives are em
ployable ones.
Aim To Acquire Skill
With Mr. Raven, the disabled stu
dents have determined individually
th? number of months it will take
to acquire the desired skill or knowl-

edge; together, they have set up
the program of studies which will
achieve it.
Perhaps once a month—more
often if necessary—the veteran con
fers with Mr. Raven to determine
whether both men feel that ad
vancement has been satisfactory and
the objective set up too low, or
ambitious. Adjustments are made
when desired, and the student con
tinues either until his allotted time
runs out, or until the skill has
been attained.
Assistance in finding employment
for these men is given by Mr. Raven,
and upon their departure from the
University, they are chalked up as
"rehabilitated."
Some Prefer G.I. Kill
Many of the veterans who are in
fact disabled have preferred to elect
the GI Bill; Mr. Raven correlates
this tendency with the desire on the
part oi most to return as quickly
as possible to normal civilian life.
However, among the several ad
vantages offered by the program is
the increased government allottment,
$92 for single men, $103.50 for mar
ried, and additional for children. A
local physician watches for the
health of each, and there is ar
rangement for immediate hospitali
zation in emergency cases.
Pension Remains Same
The pension status of the men re
mains the same throughout train
ing, unlimited by time spent in serv
ice, as are the benefits of the GI
Bill.
According to Mr. Raven, there
have been no failures in the pro
gram thus far at Stanford; spring
quarter three of the men of dis
abled veteran standing made straight
A grades.
Of Stanford's GI disabled veter
ans, one is a woman.
