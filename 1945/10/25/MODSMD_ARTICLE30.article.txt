# AST Invites All Friday

### 
The Army will be back at the Pa
vilion this week-end with another
one of its regular Friday
no-date dances, reports Sandy Wil
bourne, chairman for the dance.
"Remember," says Wilbourne,
"there are only 35 shopping days
left before December first, so drop
those books, forget about that bridge
game, and come on over to the Pa
vilion. Admission is free, and the
whole campus—civilians, Navy (if
they'll be seen without their new
uniforms), and Army—is cordially
invited."
