# AST Echoes

Pouring over their text books, I
AST's slip into their last six weeks
at Stanford with hardly a gurgle.
The knights of fun and frolic, or
rather of the slide rule and gig
slip, earnestly study such books as
"Lets take the long way home, or
through the' Cactus Gardens," and 1
"The Saga of Rosotti's Rangers."
Army Invites All
Realizing that victory for the
Navy is only 36 days away, the
AST is getting into the swing. After
the success of last Friday's G.I.
fireside all the potential civilians
(There aren't enough discharge
points in the whole place even to
get the Captain out) are shining up
their cleats and wolf traps for an
other evening of dancing to the
most sensational aggregation of rec- i
ord changers that could be found. I
Everyone on campus is invited to '
come, even the NRO's if they can (
get out of the clutches of the Bran
ner Women. Of course Joey C. I
Heidelberg sadly mused, "But I'd |
like to be in the clutches of the |
Branner Women!" There will even j
be surprise entertainment.
What Color Is It?
The center of a current contro- [
versy among the CE-s's is the color J
"Charteuse." Upon seeing a coed
wearing a sweater of that shade the
following dialogue ensues:
Mac—lt's yellow!
Stan—Baloney, it's green!
Lennie—Anyway, it's cosmopoli
tan.
The other day in an engineering
class, the prof queried. "What is the
fourth law of thermodynamics?" An
irate AST jumped up from his seat
and screamed, "Any more of these
doggone questions and I'll enlist!"
For the benefit of men with ten
gigs and the occupants of Room 130,
put your shoes on the lied this j
morning.
