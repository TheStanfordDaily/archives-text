# Traditional Bawlout Has Colorful History

Is her grade point higher than !
yours? Is he really a senior or just
trying to impress you with his big
talk? All this and the latest low
down on University facts can be
found in the Bawlout, the "Who's
Who" of Stanford.
This Directory has a long-es- j
tablished tradition behind it, for
the lirst Bawlout appeared in IH9I
soon after the founding of Stan
ford. At that time the bulletin
gave only the name, address, and
class of each student, along with
a list of the faculty. It was pub
lished as a convenience for stu
dents and the various campus of
fices.
The Bawlout of today is a much ;
more complex. Directory of Students J
and Officers. With Stanford slowly I
becoming more populated by men, j
the autumn quarter edition takes on j
an appearance similar to the 1941 I
one. The extent of the return is
particularly emphasized by the fact
that only 50 more Lower Division i
students were registered at that j
time.
For instance, the Smiths still hold
the honor of having their name ap
pear most often on the student body
list. The 1941 number of 50 Smiths
has now diminished to 33, while the t
Millers, who were third in corn-

mand, have taken second place from 1
the Andersons with 22 registered
this quarter. \
However, the total number of
students has still not returned to
the 1941 figure, since only 3,54(5
are now registered in comparison
to (he 4.032 of four years ago. The
University staff parallels this
trend, being 51 fewer than before.
Naturally the number of foreign
students was greater then due to
the present difficulties of transpor
tation. Hawaii still leads in ofT-the
mainland attendance, with 117 per
sons as compared to the 14 of 1941.
Particularly noticeable is the ab
sence of students from European
countries such as Denmark, Eng
land, Germany, and Norway, al
though Greece boasts a representa
tive this year and did not then.
Even Japan had four students here
at the time of the Pearl Harbor at
tack.
The Directory of Officers and
Students went under its official
name until 1901 when i( received
its nickname of Bawlout from the
fact that it showed up the lower
division students who were pre
tending to he juniors or seniors.
Following a fairly uneventful pat
tern of development, by 1920 it was
enlarged to include the home
number of units and grade points of
students, a record of organizations
and their officers, and a complete list
of the faculty and administrative of
ficers and their positions.
This steady growth was inter
rupted by occasional protests over
the inclusion of students' grade
points which reached a climactic
anti-Bawlout campaign in 1933. The
editorial column of the Daily re
flected this feeling by saying, "The
most-read parts of the Bawlout are
the grade-point averages of each
student."

An attempt was made to deter
mine the exact feeling of the stu
dent body on the question, but
the complaints slowly died out
after Or. Kay Lyman Wilbur, then
President of the University, pro
tested. ''Isn't it fair to give recog
nition to those who attain suc
cess?"
Now the Bawlout is a welcome
feature of Stanford life and stu
dents turn to it for almost anything.
Ever curious about what fire zone
you are in? Just turn to the back
page of the Bawlout, and listed un
der tire whistles you'll (ind that the
stock farm is in zone 43 or that
Felt Ranch is in 78.
