Billy Agnew's decision to quit Cal has dropped a bomb-shell
into future Golden Bear plans. Not that the Berkeley campus
entertained Rose Bowl hopes, but defeating UCLA, or even SC,
remained a definite possibility, but with Agnew out, the balance
of the California schedule looks dismal. Even Nevada might
dump them.
TRANSITION DIFFICULT
Why the triple threat backfield man decided to call it quits
still remains a puzzle to -us. The explanation was given that
Agnew found the transition from a soldier to a college student
too steep. He found himself unable to concentrate on his studies,
and therefore decided to take a vacation till he felt more capable
of resuming scholastic activities.
But Agnew never registered at Cal. He reported to the cam
pus about a month ago, and signified his intention to register
for the fall semester, which at Cal doesn't begin until Novem
ber. His intention to start studies made him eligible for foot
ball. All he did was report for football practice for several
hours every day. Without ever going- to classes, how could he
find out that he was unable to resume school now? We are of
the opinion that other factors influenced Agnew to drop out of
school. We would not be at all surprised to see him pop up at
another school.
ALBERT TOPS IN PRE-FLIGHT WIN
Frankie Albert marked the difference between defeat and
victory for the St. Mary's Pre-Flight aggregation when they met
the Bruins of UCLA last Friday night. The Stanford immortal
football star hadn't played a game since 1941, but he still played
a bang-up game. His passing was excellent, and the punting
was also superb. On November 4, Fleet City plays St. Mary's out
fit in San Francisco, which may turn out to be a fine tussle.
In addition to Albert, Parker Hall, Eshmont, and all the other
pros on the Airdevil team will play. Performing for the Fleet
City eleven are such boys as Buddy Young, Charley O'Rourke,
and Steve Juzwig.
