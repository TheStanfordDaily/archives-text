# Army To Clash With Buchanan
## 
### 
Army's pigskin powerhouse, paced
by fullback Bob Davis, meets its
stillest opposition of the season to
date this afternoon when the sol
diers collide with Buchanan's third
place sextet in the feature intra
mural contest. Buchanan, with a
lone defeat at the hands of Medics
111 to mar its record, has a strong
outfit which should provide the un
beaten G.l.'s, who have rolled to
three successive wins, with some
tough competition.
Medics vs. Army
The Medics, who battle the Army
next Tuesday for the championship

of League 111, have a slightly easier
opponent today in Encina IV, and
barring an upset of the first mag
nitude, the Medic six should enter
! Tuesday's crucial match with an
unblemished record.
In League 11, interest centers
around another Tuesday champion
ship tussle—the one between the
Hilltoppers and Encina 11. The Hill-
I toppers meet Jackson's un victorious
I squad today and Encina II draws a
j bye, so these two outfits are virtual
j cinches to keep their slates clean for
the title contest.

which was defeated, 32-0, by En-
I cina II on Tuesday, engages Jeffer
son, and Encina I tackles the Fire
house. The blaze-chasers are re
puled to have some additional
strength which should help the team
considerably.
League I finds Medics A, headed
for the No. 2 spot behind the Kap
pa-Dee Gees, meeting the crippled
8.8.C. Fills, who were upset, 13-12,
by Encina 111 in a late game Tues
day. The Fills, minus the services
of several of their ace players, have
lost their last two straight and prob
ably find the Medics pretty hot to
handle.
Chinese Club vs. Pierce
The Chinese Club and Pierce, two
| clubs which are sticking in there in
spite of the rough going, meet in
the other League I tussle. Both
teams have one forfeit win to their
credit and hope to gain their initial
legitimate triumph this afternoon.
The league-leading Kappa - Dee
Gees drew their second straight bye
when Van Buren, their scheduled
opponent, withdrew from the league.
Managers Careless
Coach Elwyn Bugge, in charge of
intramurals, stated that team man
agers are becoming careless about
returning equipment. Two footballs
were lost Tuesday and one other
was found by the groundkeeper
yesterday morning. The player who
signs out for the equipment is re
[ sponsible for seeing that all of it is
returned at the close of the game.
Coach Bugge also noted that the
playoffs between the three league
leaders at the close of the regular
season will be conducted on a regu
lar round-robin basis. With three
teams, no fair method of elimination
is possible.

for the No. 2 spot behind the Kap
pa-Dee Gees, meeting the crippled
8.8.C. Fills, who were upset, 13-12,
by Encina 111 in a late game Tues
day. The Fills, minus the services
of several of their ace players, have
lost their last two straight and prob
ably find the Medics pretty hot to
handle.
Chinese Club vs. Pierce
The Chinese Club and Pierce, two
| clubs which are sticking in there in
spite of the rough going, meet in
the other League I tussle. Both
teams have one forfeit win to their
credit and hope to gain their initial
legitimate triumph this afternoon.
The league-leading Kappa - Dee
Gees drew their second straight bye
when Van Buren, their scheduled
opponent, withdrew from the league.
Managers Careless
Coach Elwyn Bugge, in charge of
intramurals, stated that team man
agers are becoming careless about
returning equipment. Two footballs
were lost Tuesday and one other
was found by the groundkeeper
yesterday morning. The player who
signs out for the equipment is re
[ sponsible for seeing that all of it is
returned at the close of the game.
Coach Bugge also noted that the
playoffs between the three league
leaders at the close of the regular
season will be conducted on a regu
lar round-robin basis. With three
teams, no fair method of elimination
is possible.
Army's pigskin powerhouse, paced
by fullback Bob Davis, meets its
stillest opposition of the season to
date this afternoon when the sol
diers collide with Buchanan's third
place sextet in the feature intra
mural contest. Buchanan, with a
lone defeat at the hands of Medics
111 to mar its record, has a strong
outfit which should provide the un
beaten G.l.'s, who have rolled to
three successive wins, with some
tough competition.
Medics vs. Army
The Medics, who battle the Army
next Tuesday for the championship

of League 111, have a slightly easier
opponent today in Encina IV, and
barring an upset of the first mag
nitude, the Medic six should enter
! Tuesday's crucial match with an
unblemished record.
In League 11, interest centers
around another Tuesday champion
ship tussle—the one between the
Hilltoppers and Encina 11. The Hill-
I toppers meet Jackson's un victorious

j bye, so these two outfits are virtual
j cinches to keep their slates clean for
the title contest.
