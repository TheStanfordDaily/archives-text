# Team Cut to 27; Brown Looks Good
## 
### 
Head Basketball Coach Everett
Dean has stressed fundamentals for
the major portion of the week, and
the 27 survivors of last Monday's
cut have been going through a se
ries of co-ordination and condition
ing exercises, in addition to which
shooting techniques have been
added.
Dean has demonstrated the ex
ecution of the,one-handed push
shot and emphasized the necessity
of arching the hall so that a great
er portion of tin* basket opening
can be utilized. Dean's only
warning to his team as he demon
strates his shots is something on
the order o£ "do like I tell you.
not like I do." As far as condi
tioning is concerned the boys have
been running seven laps every
day except Saturday and Sunday,
during which they nurse "char
ley horses" and aching muscles.
The first four laps are run slow
ly: the other three consist of a
change of pace lap, one for change
of direction, and one for good
measure.
The team is shaping up slowly,
but Dean will have it ready for a

I couple of practice games in late
' November. He will probably begin
I to scrimmage the squad again after
j the next cut is made; a cut which
will probably narrow the team to
| from 15 to 21) men.
Speaking of individual pros
! pects, we would say that Dave
Hrown looks pretty good out
there, and is definitely first-string
caliber. He is fast, tricky, and
deceptive in his hall handling,
this added to the fact that he was
on the first string at .C.L.A. two
years ago puts him on the top of
the list of candidates for first
string berths. Tom Rodman, who
was a first-string forward and
| all-city man in San Francisco, was
looking good too until he twisted
his ankle last Friday. Recent re
ports are to the effect that he will
he hack soon.
The absence of athletics at Stan
ford for three years is a definite
handicap to Coach Dean, but he
hopes—and we do too —that the In
dians will put a five on the floor
that will be capable of keeping out
of the cellar in he Pacific Coast
Conferenc to make room for some
other deserving team. —Slobe
