# Conference May Propose Labor Hoard-Hopkins
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
The purpose of the labor-manage
ment conference scheduled to begin
November 5 will be to propose a
probable National Arbitration Board
with regional boards similar to the
War Labor Board structure, accord
ing to William S. Hopkins, associate
professor of economics.
The disputing parties, industry
and labor, will be urged to submit
to the board for arbitration, but
they cannot be forced to do this,
he said. If they do submit to the
board, they will be bound by the
board's decision.
TO SUPPLANT WLB
The probable new board will sup
plant the War Labor Board. "In
view of its construction and powers,
the WLB was effective only for the
war emergency, although it may
function until six months after the

war," Mr. Hopkins continued. "How
ever, it lost its effectiveness August
14. At that time, industry and la
bor members of the WLB were anx
ious to work out its peace time
Junctions, but they didn't know
what they wanted—they only knew
they wanted something."
Mr. Hopkins is a member of the
regional board of the WLB in San
Francisco. "We were meeting on
August 14." he said, "but we couldn't
make any plans that day because
of a loud whistle on a Dyeing and
Steaming establishment near us that
blew all afternoon. The next day
when we met, we could only de
cide that we wanted to do some
thing right away."
NO-STRIKE PLEDGE
The WLB was set up as a result
of a conference President Roosevelt
had ten days after Pearl Harbor.
The general outlines were decided
then and the board began function
ing one month after Pearl Hai*bor.
Tied in with the board's functions
was labor's no-strike pledge.
"The question is, did the war end
this pledge?" Mr. Hopkins said. "For
two weeks after the war neither
AFL or CIO officials said the strike
pledge was over. William Green
and Phillip Murray made no com
ment —they waited for a comment
from Washington."
NO AUTHORITY FOR ACTION
"President Truman should have
moved fast — before September 1,"
Mr. Hopkins stated. "Washington of
ficials knew the Japanese would sign
the peace', and they could have
avoided strikes. Industry and labor
could have worked their problems
out.
"As it is now. there Is no authori
ty for action on strikes. The WLB
is acting on cases prior to August
14. It can't act on new cases be
cause it has no power for directive
orders."
OPPORTUNITY MISSED
Mr. Hopkins hopes for little from
the labor-management conference.
He feels that the government has
missed its golden opportunity.
Strikes started and tension was built
•jp between labor and industry.
Both sides are feeling bitter now.
After the last World War the
government waited too long before
taking any action on this problem.
Consequently Wilson's conference
broke up in a riot. Industry and
labor wouldn't speak to each other.
WAGE CONTROL
Besides planning for a National
Arbitration Board, the government
is planning to continue some wage

control within the Department of
Labor, Mr. Hopkins continued. It
can do this under the powers it has
until six months after the war.
Both labor and industry are ma
neuvering for a position in the con
ference now, Hopkins stressed.
Both want to be strong. Strikes
demonstrate the Union strength.
Therefore, it is hard to tell which
strikes are real strikes for a wage
increase because all strike leaders
have an excuse. They say they were
having an all-day union meeting or
that nobody called the strike, and
there is nothing anyone can do to
prove the truth or falsity of their
statements, Mr. Hopkins said.
15 PER CENT WAGE INCREASE
There will be at least a 15 per
cent wage increase settled at the
conference if not before, he said.
Some industries are already paying
it, and some industries are paying
even more. However, the wage in
crease will have exceptions. The
board will also have to settle many
more issues that come between labor
and industry than wages.
"There is no way that strikes can
be stopped under our system of gov
ernment," he said. "You can't make
a man work, because that is invol
untary servitude. You can't lock
up 3,000 men unless you have a
totalitarian system of government.
Ninety-five per cent of the strikes
since the war have violated the 30-
day notice. There is nothing that
anyone can do. Even the Labor
Administration in Great Britain
can't stop its strikes.
STRIKES THREATENING
"Many more strikes are threaten
ing, and if the conference doesn't
work, conditions this winter and
spring will be terrible."
Another problem facing the con
ference will be to decide who the
arbitrators will be on the various
boards and to insure the right of
appeal. Arbitrators have to be fair,
impartial, and competent. There
used to be clergymen as arbitrators,
but they didn't understand the is
sues.
ARBITRATORS NEEDED
Arbitrators need to be experienced
people who can see both sides of
the question and are highly re
spected by both sides, Mr. Hopkins
stressed.
If industry and labor do not like
the decision of their local board,
they will be able to appeal to the
national board whose decision will
be final. Under the WLB system,
the national board has all full-time
arbitrators whereas the regional
boards have three full-time arbitra
tors. The others work part time—
usually two days a week.
GREYHOUND BIS STRIKE
Mr. Hopkins sat through 31 hear
ings on the Greyhound Bus case.
One hundred thirty-eight issues
were in dispute, of which only ten
or twelve were wage issues. Neither
the company nor the union liked
the board's decision; that is why the
strikes began.
"The average labor case has more
at stake than the average court
case," Mr. Hopkins said. "Often
times it determines whether or not
an employer can afford to stay in
business."
