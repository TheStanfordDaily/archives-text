"MAQUISARD" by Albert J. Guer
ard. Alfred A. Knopf, 1945.
$2.00.
In recent decades we have had
more than our fair share of slick
fiction and social critique. We alter
nate between "Gone With The Wind"
and "Main Street," "Forever Am
ber" and "Cass Timberlane." We
have been assaulted, year after
year, by stories that, on one hand,
are only to be read for their ad
venture, sex, or "rags to riches" j
theme, and,.on the other, with those j
that are determined to teach us the
evils of our social, political, and [
economic life.
Caught between these forceful ex
tremes a great deal of good writing j
in the middle remains unappreci- |
ated, for both novelists and readers |
have, to a large extent, lost their
sense of character. They either j
want to relax with printed day- '
dreams or to feel "socially conscious" i
'They usually ignore the less spectac
ular literature between the ex
tremes.
For that reason "Maquisard"
might never reach best-seller lists. |
II is a modest, simple, unpre- ■
tentious story, authentic in its J
background, and sincere in the '
understanding of its characters,
particularly of Jean Ruyader— ;
thirty-seven, French, for four
years in the French army, under
ground, and F.F.I.
It is late 1944. Jean's brigade,
ragged and under-equipped, guards
an almost forgotten German pock
et. Lacking even small artillery they j
cannot attack and are forced to re- !
strict their activities to endless pa
trols and waiting in slit-trenches.
Two modern, mechanized divisions
with orders to mop up the pocket
come to relieve them.
In spite of the feeling that they
could easily have finished the job
themselves with half that material,
and in spite of their dislike of the
neatly uniformed regulars and
their disgust at the thoughts of i

being absorbed into the army,
the Maquis are happy for relief
means rest, relaxation, and, best
of all, Christmas furloughs.
The greater is their disappoint
ment when the German Ardennes
offensive results in the recall of the
divisions and all leaves in the bri
gade are cancelled. Jean, who had
looked forward to seeing his four
children with whom he had not
seen together since before his wife's
death, is particularly hard hit.
"Everything was gone: it was
almost a comfort so. For there is
a certain point, beyond pain and
deprivation, where hopelessness
sets in; one simply ceases to care
.... lie knew now that nothing
more could happen; and this spnse
of having reached a kind of bot
tom. a finality of deprivation, set
him free. He was left with no
choice but to drift comfortably;
to live from day to day. for what
ever the day might bring. And if
the day brought even some small
comforts, a good motion picture
or a bottle of wine, he was that
much to the good."
From there on the plot centers
around the successful efforts of
Lieutenant Colvin, an American at
tached to the brigade, to bring Jean
and his children together.
The plot is unimportant. Im
portant is the picture of Jean,
who ran away from home at fif
teen. drifted around the world,
married, settled down only to he
uprooted again. Important also is
the picture of tired men, men who
have fought for years, men with
out future. In quick, simple
strokes Mr. Gucrard paints a
scene and a person. He can speak
of war without bitterness, he can
speak of loyalty and love without
reducing to the banal, the porno
graphic, or the psychiatric.
Jantal, who returned from fifty
two months in German prisons a
broken man, Yvette, herself a vet
eran Maquis, who left a rich home
not so much out of patriotism as a
desire to get away, the fat old Mar
cels who owns the bar where every
one gathers, Colonel Rue, who led
the brigade from its inconspicuous
start —they are all real figures,
united to form a clear whole. Only
the American lieutenant is not quite
credible in his role as Santa Claus,
and the end of this honestly told
"Christmas Tale" is too reminiscent
of Hollywood.
This calm story, brief but not
oversimplified, warm but not senti
mental, is a welcome change from
the emptiness and frigidity which
we so often encounter.
—George Brunn.

"MAQUISARD" by Albert J. Guer
ard. Alfred A. Knopf, 1945.
$2.00.
In recent decades we have had
more than our fair share of slick
fiction and social critique. We alter
nate between "Gone With The Wind"
and "Main Street," "Forever Am
ber" and "Cass Timberlane." We
have been assaulted, year after
year, by stories that, on one hand,
are only to be read for their ad
venture, sex, or "rags to riches" j
theme, and,.on the other, with those j
that are determined to teach us the
evils of our social, political, and [
economic life.
Caught between these forceful ex
tremes a great deal of good writing j
in the middle remains unappreci- |
ated, for both novelists and readers |
have, to a large extent, lost their
sense of character. They either j
want to relax with printed day- '
dreams or to feel "socially conscious" i
'They usually ignore the less spectac
ular literature between the ex
tremes.
For that reason "Maquisard"
might never reach best-seller lists. |
II is a modest, simple, unpre- ■
tentious story, authentic in its J
background, and sincere in the '
understanding of its characters,
particularly of Jean Ruyader— ;
thirty-seven, French, for four
years in the French army, under
ground, and F.F.I.
It is late 1944. Jean's brigade,
ragged and under-equipped, guards
an almost forgotten German pock
et. Lacking even small artillery they j
cannot attack and are forced to re- !
strict their activities to endless pa
trols and waiting in slit-trenches.
Two modern, mechanized divisions
with orders to mop up the pocket
come to relieve them.
In spite of the feeling that they
could easily have finished the job
themselves with half that material,
and in spite of their dislike of the
neatly uniformed regulars and
their disgust at the thoughts of i

being absorbed into the army,
the Maquis are happy for relief
means rest, relaxation, and, best
of all, Christmas furloughs.
The greater is their disappoint
ment when the German Ardennes
offensive results in the recall of the
divisions and all leaves in the bri
gade are cancelled. Jean, who had
looked forward to seeing his four
children with whom he had not
seen together since before his wife's
death, is particularly hard hit.
"Everything was gone: it was
almost a comfort so. For there is
a certain point, beyond pain and
deprivation, where hopelessness
sets in; one simply ceases to care
.... lie knew now that nothing
more could happen; and this spnse
of having reached a kind of bot
tom. a finality of deprivation, set
him free. He was left with no
choice but to drift comfortably;
to live from day to day. for what
ever the day might bring. And if
the day brought even some small
comforts, a good motion picture
or a bottle of wine, he was that
much to the good."
From there on the plot centers
around the successful efforts of
Lieutenant Colvin, an American at
tached to the brigade, to bring Jean
and his children together.
The plot is unimportant. Im
portant is the picture of Jean,
who ran away from home at fif
teen. drifted around the world,
married, settled down only to he
uprooted again. Important also is
the picture of tired men, men who
have fought for years, men with
out future. In quick, simple
strokes Mr. Gucrard paints a
scene and a person. He can speak
of war without bitterness, he can
speak of loyalty and love without
reducing to the banal, the porno
graphic, or the psychiatric.
Jantal, who returned from fifty
two months in German prisons a
broken man, Yvette, herself a vet
eran Maquis, who left a rich home
not so much out of patriotism as a
desire to get away, the fat old Mar
cels who owns the bar where every
one gathers, Colonel Rue, who led
the brigade from its inconspicuous
start —they are all real figures,
united to form a clear whole. Only
the American lieutenant is not quite
credible in his role as Santa Claus,
and the end of this honestly told
"Christmas Tale" is too reminiscent
of Hollywood.
This calm story, brief but not
oversimplified, warm but not senti
mental, is a welcome change from
the emptiness and frigidity which
we so often encounter.

"MAQUISARD" by Albert J. Guer
ard. Alfred A. Knopf, 1945.
$2.00.
In recent decades we have had
more than our fair share of slick
fiction and social critique. We alter
nate between "Gone With The Wind"
and "Main Street," "Forever Am
ber" and "Cass Timberlane." We
have been assaulted, year after
year, by stories that, on one hand,
are only to be read for their ad
venture, sex, or "rags to riches" j
theme, and,.on the other, with those j
that are determined to teach us the
evils of our social, political, and [
economic life.
Caught between these forceful ex
tremes a great deal of good writing j
in the middle remains unappreci- |
ated, for both novelists and readers |
have, to a large extent, lost their
sense of character. They either j
want to relax with printed day- '
dreams or to feel "socially conscious" i
'They usually ignore the less spectac
ular literature between the ex
tremes.
For that reason "Maquisard"
might never reach best-seller lists. |
II is a modest, simple, unpre- ■
tentious story, authentic in its J
background, and sincere in the '
understanding of its characters,
particularly of Jean Ruyader— ;
thirty-seven, French, for four
years in the French army, under
ground, and F.F.I.
It is late 1944. Jean's brigade,
ragged and under-equipped, guards
an almost forgotten German pock
et. Lacking even small artillery they j
cannot attack and are forced to re- !
strict their activities to endless pa
trols and waiting in slit-trenches.
Two modern, mechanized divisions
with orders to mop up the pocket
come to relieve them.
In spite of the feeling that they
could easily have finished the job
themselves with half that material,
and in spite of their dislike of the
neatly uniformed regulars and
their disgust at the thoughts of i

being absorbed into the army,
the Maquis are happy for relief
means rest, relaxation, and, best
of all, Christmas furloughs.
The greater is their disappoint
ment when the German Ardennes
offensive results in the recall of the
divisions and all leaves in the bri
gade are cancelled. Jean, who had
looked forward to seeing his four
children with whom he had not
seen together since before his wife's
death, is particularly hard hit.
"Everything was gone: it was
almost a comfort so. For there is
a certain point, beyond pain and
deprivation, where hopelessness
sets in; one simply ceases to care
.... lie knew now that nothing
more could happen; and this spnse
of having reached a kind of bot
tom. a finality of deprivation, set
him free. He was left with no
choice but to drift comfortably;
to live from day to day. for what
ever the day might bring. And if
the day brought even some small
comforts, a good motion picture
or a bottle of wine, he was that
much to the good."
From there on the plot centers
around the successful efforts of
Lieutenant Colvin, an American at
tached to the brigade, to bring Jean
and his children together.
The plot is unimportant. Im
portant is the picture of Jean,
who ran away from home at fif
teen. drifted around the world,
married, settled down only to he
uprooted again. Important also is
the picture of tired men, men who
have fought for years, men with
out future. In quick, simple
strokes Mr. Gucrard paints a
scene and a person. He can speak
of war without bitterness, he can
speak of loyalty and love without
reducing to the banal, the porno
graphic, or the psychiatric.
Jantal, who returned from fifty
two months in German prisons a
broken man, Yvette, herself a vet
eran Maquis, who left a rich home
not so much out of patriotism as a
desire to get away, the fat old Mar
cels who owns the bar where every
one gathers, Colonel Rue, who led
the brigade from its inconspicuous
start —they are all real figures,
united to form a clear whole. Only
the American lieutenant is not quite
credible in his role as Santa Claus,
and the end of this honestly told
"Christmas Tale" is too reminiscent
of Hollywood.
This calm story, brief but not
oversimplified, warm but not senti
mental, is a welcome change from
the emptiness and frigidity which
we so often encounter.
