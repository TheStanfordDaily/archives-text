## 
### BOB PECK 
"The biggest thrill I ever had in
a football game was the 191)2 South
ern California-Notre Dame game
when the two schools were playing
for the National Championship,"
Marchie Schwartz said.
The head Farm football coach
went on to say that "Notre Dame
walloped the pants ofl" Southern
Cal that day, 20-0, before a ca
pacity crowd in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
"That game was the last game
that Knutc Rncknc coached and
was a glorious way for him to
wind up his career," Coach
Schwartz said.

The Notre Dame players had been
pointing for this game all season
and knocked El Trojan out of the
Coliseum. Marchie was playing his
last game for the Fighting Irish
and graduated from Notre Dame the
following June.
"My biggest thrill in a coaching
capacity was the 1940 Indian sea
son and the Rose Bowl victory
over Nebraska," Schwartz went on
to say.
That season Marchie was an as
sistant coach to Clark Shaug
nessv, and Stanford went through
an undefeated season ending with
a 21-13 Rose Bowl victory over
the Cornhuskers.
The Stanford eleven with virtual
ly the same players had failed to
win a game on the Pacific Coast
the year before and under a new

coaching regime went on to become
possibly the best team in the nation.
"In a bead coaching position 1
was tremendously pleased with
the way th;> kids showed up in
the last games of the \'M2 season,"
Schwartz said.
'"That season they lost their first
three games and a later game to
UCLA but went on to whip Wash
ington, Oregon Stato, California, and
St. Mary's Pre-Flight," the coach
said.
In tliat last game with St.
Mary's Pre-flight the Indians car
lied on without Mart-hie. He had
been called cast because of illness
and the kids were playing a team
that had ex-Stanford stars Bobby
(irayson and Frankie Albert on it.
The Indians came through in grand
style that day, though, and knocked
the undefeated Pre-Flighters back to
Moraga. Scoring twice . before St.
Mary's had a chance to breathe, the
Indians went on the win 28-13.
