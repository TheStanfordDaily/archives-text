And since it's in two shades, this wool
jersey combination is doubly flattering.
The softly _ gathered blouse with its wee
sleeves and tiny "v" neck is a pale grey . . .
and the darker skirt is one of those indis
pensable dirndls you can wear, too, with
your tucked-in sweaters. You can cinch
in your waist with a wide leather belt . . .
or, if you want to be more daring, circle it
with a gaudy bandana from your collection.
