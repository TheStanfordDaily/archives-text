### 
Topics discussed at Housing Com
mittee's meeting yesterday were:
1. Social Committee for fresh
man entertainment.
2. Exchange dinners with the
Row.
Joan Bailey was appointed chair
man of a social committee to work
on plans for entertainment of fresh
man women winter and spring
quarter.

Her committee will be the two
newly appointed freshman repre
sentatives to Housing Committee,
Betsy Brown and Theo McGuire;
Mary Elizabeth Hall representing
Casa Ventura; Gloria Cassidy and
Babs Wilbur, Lagunita; Jackie Bou
cher, Union Unit; Bev Leggett, the
Row; and Shirley Marx, Branner.
The committee will work out
dates for the planned entertainment
program, devise a system for edu
cating the freshmen on the differ
ent types of living groups, and plan
the type of entertainment to be
used.
Informal Parties
Old students and new students are
encouraged to become acquainted
this quarter through unplanned, in
formal entertainment. It was sug
gested that having coke parties af
ter volleyball games would be a
good way for students to get to
gether in small groups informally.
Room drawings will take place
during spring quarter. The new
Social Committee will meet Monday
at. 2 p.m. in the Excom room to start
planning.
Exchange Dinners
Equal exchange dinners between
individual Row houses and the large
dining units — Lagunita, Branner,
Union Unit, and Roble—will be pos
sible on any nights except Wednes
day and Sunday if the various house
mothers on the Row approve.
Equal Exchanges
The exchanges will have to be
organized so that an even exchange
of girls is made. They can be
planned through the consent of a
house mother and the director of a
large dining unit.
