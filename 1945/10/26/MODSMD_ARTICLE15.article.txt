# Cardinals Plan Rally at Ruble; Urge Learning of Songs, Yells
## 
### 
Rally Com will start its post war activities with an informal rally at
Roble Nov. 5. The committee is starting a drive to teach new students
Stanford songs and yells in preparation for the two rallies planned
for November.
At the Roble affair a Cardinals member will give a talk on traditions.
—— ♦Cheer leader Newt Arnold will di-

rect the singing, aided by the en
tire Rally Com. Don Foster and
Nancy Spackman are in charge of
the event.
According to Rally Com head,
Eugene Mitguard, the older Farm
students also need brushing up
on songs. Bonnie Hansen and Bill
Blaisdell will organize plans for
small rallies at all the other liv
ing groups.
If we want our first all-campus
rallies to be a success, every student
must know Stanford songs and yells
really well, stated Mitguard.
According to present plans,
Toyon will be the second group
that Rally Com will visit. Mem
bers of the committee see a real
need in creating spirit among the
service students.
At the Rally Com meeting Wed
nesday night, plans for a dance later
in the quarter were discussed un
officially. The committee hopes to
be wearing its white sweaters be
fore long.
