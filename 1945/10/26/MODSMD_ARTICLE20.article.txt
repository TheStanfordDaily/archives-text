# 'Highland Fling' Termed 'Excellent' by First Night Audience-Reviewer
## Scotch Ghost Hero Caught By Nagging Angel Wife As He Cheats at Solitaire 
### RENA JEAN BLACK 
The theater-goer who turned to
his companion as he walked out
the door of the Memorial Audi
torium last night and said, "I've
never seen a better play in this
theater," was echoing the opinions
of the entire audience which
viewed the first night performance
of " A Highland Eling."
From the first scenc in which the
Scotch ghost hero was discovered
cheating at solitaire by his nagging
angel wife, to the last scene where
they fly off to heaven together, the
fantasy of the situations and the ex
cellence of the performers delighted
the crowd which filled the audito
rium. Jack Palance deserves spe
cial mention for his portrayal of the
150 year old ghost, for he turned
the unearthly Don Juan into a
comedian that stole the show for
acting honors.
The entire cast was perfect in
execution and interpretation.
Scotch accents ran riot in every
characterization except those of
the American and his daughter,
and were the seemingly effort
less result of what must have
taken long preparation. The Angel
wife of the Ghost, played by Mrs.
Judy Shrader, heckled her earth
bound husband to the delight of
the audience, which anticipated

her entrances by sound effects of
ethereal mood music. Carol
Boettcher, as Silly, the sweetheart
of the ghost was also perfect in
her role.
Surely much credit must go to
Norman Philbrick of the Drama De
partment for the performances of
the entire cast. The production had
a finished quality rarely seen to such
an extent in a college show, and
every actor was convincing. Tlir
comedy situations, of which there
were many, were exceptionally well
worked out, but the sad scenes were
just as mood perfect. The first de
parture of the ghost from earth was
especially moving.
Stage settings were the exterior
of a Scotch castle, and thtf in
terior of a Scotch pub. The per
spective of the castle set was such
that it seemed to extend down a
hill, and the lighting effects of
the blue sky outlining the castle,
and several trees, had color quali
ty worthy of a technicolor movie.
Theater reviews are often sarcastic,
naming all the mistakes of a pro
duction in big black print, and iÂ£
George Jean Nathan were dead ho
would undoubtedly turn over in bin
grave at this review, which has
nothing but enthusiastic approval
for this Stanford Players' production.
Every performance brought a hand
for the entire cast, which was out
standing, even to the friends of
Robbie the Sinner, who spent most
of the evening drinking beer in the
Rose and Thistle pub. John Munsell,
as Robbie, and Pat Neilson as
Alicetrina, were especially good
comedians, with honors going to Miss
Neilson for her crying scene in the
second act, which brought both a
sympathetic and a laughing response.
Reverend Stuart, played by William
Melton, was charming; Duane Heath
had complete audience approval
when he won Silly's love from the
Ghost; Dolly Geng, Jane Salisbury,
Martin Nalder, Ber*;ice Rosenthal
and Patricia Anderson, all were ex
cellent. Costumes by Muriel Liev
say of the Wardrobe Department
were interesting and appropriate.
