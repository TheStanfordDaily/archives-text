# Stanford Professor Was Director Of Atomic Research in New Mexico
## 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
Professor Norris E. Bradbury, on
leave from the Stanford physics de
partment, was appointed director of
the atom bomb project at Los Ala
mos, New Mexico, on October 17
succeeding Dr. Robert Oppenheimer,
who is returning to the California
Institute of Technology.
Professor Bradbury has been a
naval commander since 1941, and
was stationed at the Naval Proving
Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia. In
July 1944, he was transferred to the
government atomic bomb laboratory
at Los Alamos, where he was con
nected with the research and test
ing of the bomb. He remained in the
navy until shortly before he was ap
pointed director of the project in
New Mexico.
Other Professors at Los Alamos
Several other members of the
Stanford faculty have been with the
New Mexico project. Among them
Dr. Mans Staub, also of the
physics department, has been taking
part in experimental research in the
atom bomb laboratory as well. Dr.
Staub plans to return to Stanford
next year on March 1. Dr. Felix
Bloch, also of the physics depart
ment. returned recently from the
Los Alamos project.
Also working on the project is
David Nicodemus, former acting in
structor in the summer of 1942. E. J.
Demson left Stanford this morning
by plane for New Mexico to be
come personnel director of the
project.
Radioactive Sand on Display
On display in Jordan Hall is a
piece of sand from the site of the

dropping of the first atom bomb in
New Mexico in July of this year.
By means of the apparatus on the
display case, every student may
prove that the area is still radio
active. The audible clicks coming
from the loudspeaker above the ex
hibit and the vertical lines on the
oscillograph show that the piece of
sand is still radioactive. This radi
ation is due to gamma rays.
No experimentation has been done
at Stanford to ascertain the dura
tion of the radioactivity; however,
the sand is still slightly radioactive
after three months.
When the area of the bomb drop
ping was first entered, the observers
were in a lead-coated tank to pro
tect themselves from the expected
rays. The rays were found to be not
so dangerous as had been antici
pated; however, even now observ
ers are only allowed on the site of
the experiment, for about four hours
by the medical men connected with
the project.
