WHO'S "PASSING THE BUCK?"
V/ith members of Ram's Head present and
participating in the discussion, Excom, Wednes
day night, set up a committee to review all
student productions, beginning with the No
vember Gaieties, to guarantee "good taste" in
the selection of the acts shown. What was
rnor-.t e mazing about that night was the fact
that Ham's Head did not object to the formation
of h a committee! To the contrary, general
opinion seemed to be that a committee of three,
one Rain's Head member, two Excom members,
could lightly and adequately accept full re
sponsibility for reviewing all student produc
tions and censoring them if they did not con
form to the committee's standards, whatever
they may be!
Stanford, throughout its recent history, has
had a remarkable record of independence in
student government and student activities. Stu
dent publications, productions, and other activi
ties have been free from any outside control
because Stanford students in those organiza
tions were considered mature enough to accept
the responsibility for their organization's ac
tions.
Now, however, Ram's Head is turning over to
n committee what has always been the drama
group's responsibility to the Stanford student
body the maintenance of decency and good
taste in the production of a student show. What
now would prevent the formation of a similar
committee to review and censor other student
activities or publications? A decision passed
hastily and unthinkingly because one group
doss not wish to be held personally account
able could establish a precedent for further
control of student affairs by committees with
purely arbitrary standards.
Ram's Head was led to believe that if stan
dards of their productions were not improved,
supervision would be assumed by the Adminis
tration and or faculty. The Daily in the past
has criticized laxity in taste in student produc
tion's. Ram's Head has recognized this, but in
the effort to correct the situation has rejected
all responsibility by accepting a committee
composed of two Excom members and only one
Ram's Head member. We feel that Ram's Head
is capable of producing and assuming the re
sponsibility for its productions. If Ram's Head
feels that it is too close to the authors of skits
submitted to cut out objectionable sections, a
committee with impartial members on it may
be in order; at all times, however, Ram's Head
should retain a majority of members, and as
sume the obligations of speaking for Stanford.
