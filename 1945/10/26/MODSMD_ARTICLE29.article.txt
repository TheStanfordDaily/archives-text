There are reasons for leaving Stanford, be
sides the Registrar's lead-plated sledge ham
mer. These people who go guietly of their
own accord are the very pride of the fiends
who go about their murderous work, chanting,
"Just 500 more dames to give the boot, then
v/e can take the peplums off the football suits."
You can find them nearly every morning,
lining the ledge around the top of the Hoover
Tower, waiting for the 8:15 pigeon flight to the
outer v/orld. And most of the time they aren't
sufferers from Bawlout frustration. Rather,
they're the ones who have gold-plated editions,
the ones who sit in the independent study
rooms, the ones who do suggested reading—
but they're unhappy. They're the unfortunates,
the persecuted.
Here are a few pre-flight explanations:
Journalism Major: "My name's Wilma
Hearst—and I still think that red's a pretty
color!"
Psych. Major: "I paid my tent rent for the

quarter, and I'll be darned if I'll let 'em keep
me locked up in a cage! Bllrrrrrb!"
Biology Major: "Seems awfully queer to
me that they won't let us take the scraps home
for stew."
Art Major: "I came to Stanford to take art,
and all they did was give me an easel and
some paints and put me on the Quad."
Pre-Med.: "It's the hair dressers around here.
One told me the other day while she was
massaging my epidermis, that she'd always
wanted to be a doctor. In fact, she plays doctor
when she's picking chickens—is that the way
we do it —huh—is it, huh?"
Theology Major: "Harumph!" (She was so
intrigued with the study of evil, that she stayed
for two quarters before she found that Stanford
doesn't have a Theology Department.)
Chem Major: "Potassium nitrate plus trini
trotoluene—well, try it some evening when
you're out for a thrill."
English Major: "They kicked me out of all
the writing classes and told me I wrote the
kind of trash you might find in a True Love
n-jagazine. To think, only a year of college, and
I'm an author already!"
Pre-Law: "Is that what I am? I've been filed
away under Mail Service in the law libe ever
since one reg day several years ago when I
was delivering mail at the Ad Building."
Cellah Dwellah: "Chees! Da milk shakes
get thinner every day!"
