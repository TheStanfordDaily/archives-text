### Elliot Epsteen 
Congress has voted a large scale tax cut.
All those earning less than $3,000 a year are no
longer paying taxes to the government. Excess
profit taxes and excise taxes have been almost
eliminated.
At first glance this would not seem to be a
very skillful financial policy. Coupled with
such concepts as a large national army and a
full employment bill, it would seem that this is
the application of the old adage:
"The best way to be a successful senator,
son, is to vote for all appropriations and against
all taxes."
Necessity
However, the move is not a contribution to
insolvency. In fact, lowered taxes are the best
way to keep our economy stable at the pres
ent time. There is a lot of excess credit in op
eration because of the war. There is a slight
inflation, but it is not alarming, yet.
However that is not a sign that everything is
all right. The history of inflations has been
that they can go through three stages, and this
might be the symptomatic second. The first
of these stages is the controlled stage, when
everything progresses normally, but more cred
it than goods or services is piling up. The sec
ond is the critical stage, when there is a gradu
ally mounting inflation, but nothing like what
there could be. The third is the explosive stage,
when prices go up like a V-2 bomb and the
monetary unit's worth becomes history.
Third Stage
The third stage of the inflation is the worst.
However, the existence of the first two stages
does not mean that the third is inevitable. Us
ually, it can be halted.
Since an inflation means much more money
than goods and services, the simple way is to
encourage the production of more goods. This
means lowered tax rates on business, and it
accomplishes two things. It causes a business
boom to translate the money into needed things,
and it siphons some of it off into long-term
bond holdings.
Future Tax Policy
However, manufacture is only the problem
of the present. That of the future is curbing
the opposite economic trend, the deflationary
spiral.
Many people in Washington have adopted
the philosophy of a moderately planned econ
omy. In the next year they might try to bring
it about through a tax policy. The first stage
would be to establish a definitely low set of
taxes on those making under $3,000 a year to
increase their buying power; and the second,
to force business to turn a good part of its prof
its into industrial expansion, and to push mid
dle-class incomes into responsible sections of
the stock market.
This might leave a question of, "What about
the national debt?" It is so large that it can
only be paid off in a long term plan, and the
best policy for such a scheme does not have
to be thrust into relief to keep the nation alive.
The main fight against such a step would be
philosophical, however. Most of the congress is
inhibited by lassiez faire economic philoso
phies, however, and does not believe in plan
ned economy at all. They have a good point
when they say it contributes to regimentation.
But the large industrial baronies of America
are so thoroughly mobilized already that no
sterner discipline would be laid down. In
fact, the only thing that could be said would
be that society was requesting that the fruits
of the system be turned more towards society.
However, if such a scheme arises, there will
be a fight on this issue. The real settlement
might be, "Does anybody have a better plan?"
