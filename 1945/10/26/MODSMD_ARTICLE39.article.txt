# Priest Returns From War Tour
## 
### 
Rev. Bernard R. Hubbard, the
"Glacier Priest," returned home to
Santa Clara University last week
after a three month tour of war
torn Europe.
The dynamic father, who spent 18
years in Alaska, had been sent to
Europe to make a survey of dam
aged church property.
