were discussed by Coach Elwyn
Bugge and tennis aspirants at a
meeting held Wednesday.
As yet the Pacific Coast Confer
ence has not arranged a schedule
for this year and Coach Bugge
will not attempt to schedule ten
nis until the conference announces
its intentions.
"Tennis practice will be held this
fall so that we can get the boys
started towards a good season,"
Coach Bugge said.
So far the fellows out for tennis
have been practicing among them
selves. Coach Bugge has arranged
a tournament for the men early
next month. Later, as the team
progresses, practice will be held on
Saturday afternoons.
Finally, sometime during winter
quarter, the team will be cut down
to the 10 or 12 best players in the
school.
The last tennis team on the Farm
was in 1543. That year prospects
were good during autumn quarter,
but by the time the season started,
most of the advanced players had
left school.
Some of the men who have shown
promise so far are Tom Sofield, Gene
Corman, Grover Miller, Jimmy
