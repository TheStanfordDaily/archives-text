# Old Editor Sees Ahead
## 
### ROGER CORMAN 
Whenever a former Daily sports
editor comes back to the Farm, he
always clamps onto the new editor
and twists his arm until he gets per
mission to write something.
Having gotten this permission,
I'd like to bring up the case of
one Hob West. Known as Bullet
Bob, or the greatest back to come
out of the Big Seven Conference
since Whizzer White. West is a
somewhat better than terrific
runner and passer. Last year, his
first in college competition, he
made all-conference and honor
able mention All-American.
Naturally this kind of attention
got the boy some attention and he
was offered a job winding seven
day clocks at Southern Cal, along
with other propositions from Ten
nessee and Georgia.
Having brains as well as ability,
however, Bob wants to play for
Stanford—if he can get a scholar
ship, job, or some other suave way
of getting through school.
What Policy
This brings up the question of
just what is Stanford's policy to
ward this sort of thing now that
the war is over. If we come through
with a liberal policy, the Big Red
Machine will start rolling again and
not only West, but other great and
potentially great ball players will
make the trek to the Farm. If not,
well, it's just another case of win
a few —lose a few.
This decision should be made
now, so the alumni and other friends
of the Cardinal can start beating
the bushes for talent. To see the
Indians in the Rose Bowl once more
would be a beautiful sight, but han
dicapped as we are by those long
years of no competition, the day will
be long in coming if something isn't
done now.
