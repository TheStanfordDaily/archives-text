Branch Rickey deserves a round of applause for signing Jack- I
ie Robinson, Negro baseball player, to perform for the Montreal
club in the International League. Montreal is a farm club of the
Brooklyn Dodgers, of which Rickey is the general manager.
Rickey's only possible reason for signing Robinson is that
he wishes to improve the status of his ball club. To him it
doesn't make any difference whether a man is black, white, or
any other color. The only criterion is the man's ability to play
baseball. And that is the right attitude. It is high time that
"jim-crowism" be put to a stop in pro ball.
Baseball talent knows no color line. Some of the finest base
ball players in America are colored. Satchel Paige, just as an
example, is said to be one of the greatest pitchers of the 20th
Century. Kenny Washington, more known as a football player,
is equally able with a baseball mitt.
APPLAUSE FOR ROBINSON
Well-deserved credit should also go Jackie Robinson's way.
The pressure on him will be terrific. All eyes will be gazed his
way. Robinson's future in baseball should depend entirely on
his ability to play baseball. No favoritism should be given him
because of his color, nor should more be expected of him be
cause he is colored. That is the only fair treatment to accord
him. If Robinson isn't of double AA caliber he should be farmed
out to a lower league or released. If he proves his worth (which
we think he'll do) then he deserves all due credit.
Rickey couldn't have chosen a finer man to be the first col
ored baseball player to ink a contract in professional ball. Rob
inson is a graduate of UCLA and served three years in the army
es an officer. (This writer will never forget the statue of liberty
football play Jackie Robinson and Kenny Washington pulled off
in the UCLA-USC game of '39. It was the most perfectly executed
football play we have ever seen.)
No outright criticism has been made of the move yet, except
a few grunts from some southerners. Clark Griffith, owner of
the Washington Senators, has started shedding crocodile tears
for the Kansas City Monarchs, the team Robinson played for this
year. The latter club has claimed that Robinson was "stolen"
from them. We doubt it. Rickey is no legal yokel, and he surely
must have closely scrutinized Robinson's connections with the
Negro club before he signed him.
AGREEMENT SHOULD BE MADE
But an agreement should be reached with the "American"
and "National" circuits. Now that the lid has been lifted, other
clubs will look around for colored players. Either the Negro
leagues should disband, or it should fully, similar to
the way the other leagues are organized. Present organization
is very loose. Present players are on a "come and go" basis.
Contracts are made from year to year, and players are free agents
at the end of every season.
Again —credit to Rickey and Robinson. The ice has been cut.
Baseball is on its way to being truly the national pastime of the
United States.

Again —credit to Rickey and Robinson. The ice has been cut.
Baseball is on its way to being truly the national pastime of the
United States.
Branch Rickey deserves a round of applause for signing Jack- I
ie Robinson, Negro baseball player, to perform for the Montreal
club in the International League. Montreal is a farm club of the
Brooklyn Dodgers, of which Rickey is the general manager.
Rickey's only possible reason for signing Robinson is that
he wishes to improve the status of his ball club. To him it
doesn't make any difference whether a man is black, white, or
any other color. The only criterion is the man's ability to play
baseball. And that is the right attitude. It is high time that
"jim-crowism" be put to a stop in pro ball.
Baseball talent knows no color line. Some of the finest base
ball players in America are colored. Satchel Paige, just as an
example, is said to be one of the greatest pitchers of the 20th
Century. Kenny Washington, more known as a football player,
is equally able with a baseball mitt.
APPLAUSE FOR ROBINSON
Well-deserved credit should also go Jackie Robinson's way.
The pressure on him will be terrific. All eyes will be gazed his
way. Robinson's future in baseball should depend entirely on
his ability to play baseball. No favoritism should be given him
because of his color, nor should more be expected of him be
cause he is colored. That is the only fair treatment to accord
him. If Robinson isn't of double AA caliber he should be farmed
out to a lower league or released. If he proves his worth (which
we think he'll do) then he deserves all due credit.
Rickey couldn't have chosen a finer man to be the first col
ored baseball player to ink a contract in professional ball. Rob
inson is a graduate of UCLA and served three years in the army
es an officer. (This writer will never forget the statue of liberty
football play Jackie Robinson and Kenny Washington pulled off
in the UCLA-USC game of '39. It was the most perfectly executed
football play we have ever seen.)
No outright criticism has been made of the move yet, except
a few grunts from some southerners. Clark Griffith, owner of
the Washington Senators, has started shedding crocodile tears
for the Kansas City Monarchs, the team Robinson played for this
year. The latter club has claimed that Robinson was "stolen"
from them. We doubt it. Rickey is no legal yokel, and he surely
must have closely scrutinized Robinson's connections with the
Negro club before he signed him.
AGREEMENT SHOULD BE MADE
But an agreement should be reached with the "American"
and "National" circuits. Now that the lid has been lifted, other
clubs will look around for colored players. Either the Negro
leagues should disband, or it should fully, similar to
the way the other leagues are organized. Present organization
is very loose. Present players are on a "come and go" basis.
Contracts are made from year to year, and players are free agents
at the end of every season.
