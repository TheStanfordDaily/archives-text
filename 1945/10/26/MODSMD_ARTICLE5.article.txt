# Influence of Milton Told by Sensabaugh
## First Meeting of Philological Club Hears Talk by English Professor 
### 
George Frank Sensabaugh, associate professor of English, in his address
to the Stanford Philological Association yesterday, brought to light some
neglected evidence on John Milton's influence on English political thought.
Davidson Masson, in his biography of Milton, assumed that Milton was
an important political influence in England especially during the period

of the Puritan Revolution, said
Professor Sensabaugh. This opin
ion was widespread among the ear
ly biographers.
Period of Skepticism
In the twentieth century, how
ever, Professor Sensabaugh pointed
out, a period of skepticism has set
in. Notable among the skeptical
scholars is Professor William Hal
ler, who made a survey of the
pamphlets of the time of the Puritan
Revolution and decided that Mil
ton's influence on the political
thought of the day was negligible.
He assigns more importance to such
writers as Lilburne and Walwyn in
the shaping of public opinion.
In view of this conflicting schol
arly thought, said Professor Sensa
baugh, we might question whether
Milton helped shape English politi
cal thought at all, and if so, to what
extent. Here, he brought out his
point that although it may be true
that Milton had little influence dur
ing the period of the Puritan Revo
lution, however, after his death his
opinions were extensively used in
the Revolution of 1(388.
Issue of Kingship
During the Revolution of IGBB,
Professor Sensabaugh said, a great
pamphlet debate grew up over the
issue of kingship. The Jacobites
were in favor of divine right, while
the Williamites upheld the theory
of contract.
The Williamites made definite use
of Milton in arguing for their the
ory by adapting Milton's essays to
fiit the needs of the day and pub
lishing them anonymously.
Opposing Faction
Professor Sensabaugh stated fur
ther that the opposing faction, the
Jacobites, considered Milton as one
of the chief enemies of their cause
and hurled invectives against him
in their pamphlets.
It appears then, Professor Sensa
baugh concluded, that in the period
from 1(588 to 1694, when public opin
ion on kingship was taking place.
Milton was a considerable influence
on political thought, and that the
opinions of both Massori and Haller
are in need of revision.—Barbara

in. Notable among the skeptical
scholars is Professor William Hal
ler, who made a survey of the
pamphlets of the time of the Puritan
Revolution and decided that Mil
ton's influence on the political
thought of the day was negligible.
He assigns more importance to such
writers as Lilburne and Walwyn in
the shaping of public opinion.
In view of this conflicting schol
arly thought, said Professor Sensa
baugh, we might question whether
Milton helped shape English politi
cal thought at all, and if so, to what
extent. Here, he brought out his
point that although it may be true
that Milton had little influence dur
ing the period of the Puritan Revo
lution, however, after his death his
opinions were extensively used in
the Revolution of 1(388.
Issue of Kingship
During the Revolution of IGBB,
Professor Sensabaugh said, a great
pamphlet debate grew up over the
issue of kingship. The Jacobites
were in favor of divine right, while
the Williamites upheld the theory
of contract.
The Williamites made definite use
of Milton in arguing for their the
ory by adapting Milton's essays to
fiit the needs of the day and pub
lishing them anonymously.
Opposing Faction
Professor Sensabaugh stated fur
ther that the opposing faction, the
Jacobites, considered Milton as one
of the chief enemies of their cause
and hurled invectives against him
in their pamphlets.
It appears then, Professor Sensa
baugh concluded, that in the period
from 1(588 to 1694, when public opin
ion on kingship was taking place.
Milton was a considerable influence
on political thought, and that the
opinions of both Massori and Haller
are in need of revision.—Barbara

George Frank Sensabaugh, associate professor of English, in his address
to the Stanford Philological Association yesterday, brought to light some
neglected evidence on John Milton's influence on English political thought.
Davidson Masson, in his biography of Milton, assumed that Milton was
an important political influence in England especially during the period

of the Puritan Revolution, said
Professor Sensabaugh. This opin
ion was widespread among the ear
ly biographers.
Period of Skepticism
In the twentieth century, how
ever, Professor Sensabaugh pointed
out, a period of skepticism has set
in. Notable among the skeptical
scholars is Professor William Hal
ler, who made a survey of the
pamphlets of the time of the Puritan
Revolution and decided that Mil
ton's influence on the political
thought of the day was negligible.
