# Influence of Milton Told by Sensabaugh
## First Meeting of Philological Club Hears Talk by English Professor 
### 
George Frank Sensabaugh, associate professor of English, in his address
to the Stanford Philological Association yesterday, brought to light some
neglected evidence on John Milton's influence on English political thought.
Davidson Masson, in his biography of Milton, assumed that Milton was
an important political influence in England especially during the period

of the Puritan Revolution, said
Professor Sensabaugh. This opin

ly biographers.
Period of Skepticism
In the twentieth century, how
ever, Professor Sensabaugh pointed
out, a period of skepticism has set
in. Notable among the skeptical
scholars is Professor William Hal

pamphlets of the time of the Puritan
Revolution and decided that Mil
ton's influence on the political
thought of the day was negligible.
He assigns more importance to such
writers as Lilburne and Walwyn in
the shaping of public opinion.
In view of this conflicting schol
arly thought, said Professor Sensa
baugh, we might question whether
Milton helped shape English politi
cal thought at all, and if so, to what
extent. Here, he brought out his
point that although it may be true
that Milton had little influence dur
ing the period of the Puritan Revo

opinions were extensively used in
the Revolution of 1(388.
