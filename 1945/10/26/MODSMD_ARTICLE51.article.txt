# Truman Urges Immediate World Atomic Meeting
## Japs Tried Atom Bomb Early in War, Abandoned for Death Ray Experiment 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (UP). —An immediate world conference on
atomic energy to forestall a disastrous armament race was urged today
amid disclosure that the Japanese experimented with atomic energy early
in the war, but abandoned the project because they thought it unworkable.
Meanwhile, President Truman told his news conference that he expects

► to have another announcement soon
on recommendations for the control
of atomic energy.
Mr. Truman was asked upon
whose advice he acted in decid
ing to keep secret the U.S. meth
ods of producing the atomic bomb.
He replied tersely that he was re
lying on his own judgment.
Sen. Brien McMahon said the ma-
I jor powers must get together im-
I mediately to prevent an "arms race
I to end all arms races."
He disputed contentions "that
j we cannot discuss the control of
J atomic energy with our allies be
' cause this would require us to
i give away the secret."
I "There is no secret," he said in a
radio address. "We have nothing
real to give save a share in the
awful responsibility we now bear
alone."
The only advantage this nation
now has is the "know-how" of as
sembling the bomb, he said, and
1 this advantage will disappear as
I soon as "a rich and powerful na
-1 tion like Russia desires to catch
up."
Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, disclosed that while
Japanese scientists talked of making
an atomic bomb, they miscalculated
the amount of energy that would be
released and stopped all research
long before the war ended.
He and other scientists testified
| before a special Senate sub-com
mittee considering bills to set up
a national science foundation.
They joined in condemning a pol
i icy of secrecy in scientific re
| search.
Dr. Henry D. Smyth, of Princeton
j University, author of the War De
partment's report* on the atomic
| bomb, warned that secrecy in atomic
| research "will smother the hope of
progress not only in that science
but in all other sciences."
Compton, who recently com
pleted an inspection of Japanese
! research, also revealed that Jap
anese scientists had developed a
death ray that was capable of
killing a rabbit at !50 paces. He
] said, however, that this, like the
! Japanese paper balloons, was in
j tended mainly to boost civilian
| morale.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (UP). —An immediate world conference on
atomic energy to forestall a disastrous armament race was urged today
amid disclosure that the Japanese experimented with atomic energy early
in the war, but abandoned the project because they thought it unworkable.
Meanwhile, President Truman told his news conference that he expects

► to have another announcement soon
on recommendations for the control
of atomic energy.
Mr. Truman was asked upon
whose advice he acted in decid
ing to keep secret the U.S. meth
ods of producing the atomic bomb.
He replied tersely that he was re
