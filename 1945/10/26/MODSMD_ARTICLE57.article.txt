hoboes? Forty articles will be re
quired of each group at the Sopho
more Scavenger Hunt set for next
Friday night.
The hunt will be preceded by a |
class meeting in the Nitery at 7:30.
Students should form groups of ten
before Friday and be prepared to
search the campus for loot. After
the Scavenger Hunt, which ends at
10:30, the sophs may attend the War

President Bob Stephens, Secretary
