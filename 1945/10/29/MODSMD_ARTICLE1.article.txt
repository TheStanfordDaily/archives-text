# Tresidder Favors U.S. Keeping Bomb Secret
## 
### 
"I have little confidcnce that an
international conference can outlaw
the use of the atomic bomb," Donald
B. Tresidder, president of Stanford,
said after returning from a trip to
the East where he talked with va
rious experts on the bomb.
However, Dr. Tresidder thinks an
international commission should be
set up to enforce regulations in re
spcct to the mining of uranium and
its subsequent use in each country.
The commission should have repre
sentatives from every country so
that there will be no opportunity
for any country to use the atomic
bomb as a blackmail weapon against
another country, he stressed.
No Defense Against Bomb
"The only defense against the
bomb," he said, " is not to be there
when it goes off. It is a particular
threat to the essentially urban civili
zation of the United States, and an
immediate dispersal of our large in
dustries is necessary."
It is hard to keep things secret
long, according to Dr. Tresidder, but
the United States managed to main
tain the secrecy of radar and the
bomb-sight. He thinks, therefore,

that the United States should defi
nitely maintain secrecy on the man
ufacture and method and use of the
bomb, even though other nations,
having the idea, will probably be
able to discover the method.
Commission Recommended
"We must establish a government

commission to supervise the use of
the bomb in the United States," Dr.
Tresidder continued. "The purpose
of the commission will be to pre
vent the bomb's use for blackmail
and war and also to protect the
public safety. An atomic bomb plant
needs protection just as a dynamite
manufacturing plant does."
The bomb has tremendous de
fense implications, but its domestic
uses will be far in the future, Dr.
Tresidder said. After talking to ex
perts in the East, lie feels that there
is no imminent peacetime use; it is
now just an offensive wartime
weapon.
Military System Obsolete
Because it is such a tremendous
weapon, he thinks our whole mili
tary system should be restudicd by
a defense commission. "People used
to believe that an airplane could
never sink a battleship," he said.
"People today do not realize the
full consequences of one blast of
the bomb."
Dr. Tresidder thinks that the
atomic bomb is the greatest force
in civilization since the discovery of
fire. He does not believe the world
is ready for it.—Nancy Bannick.

Because it is such a tremendous
weapon, he thinks our whole mili
tary system should be restudicd by
a defense commission. "People used
to believe that an airplane could
never sink a battleship," he said.
"People today do not realize the
full consequences of one blast of
the bomb."

atomic bomb is the greatest force
in civilization since the discovery of
fire. He does not believe the world
is ready for it.—Nancy Bannick.

"I have little confidcnce that an
international conference can outlaw
the use of the atomic bomb," Donald
B. Tresidder, president of Stanford,
said after returning from a trip to
the East where he talked with va
rious experts on the bomb.
However, Dr. Tresidder thinks an
international commission should be
set up to enforce regulations in re
spcct to the mining of uranium and
its subsequent use in each country.
The commission should have repre
sentatives from every country so
that there will be no opportunity
for any country to use the atomic
bomb as a blackmail weapon against
another country, he stressed.
No Defense Against Bomb
"The only defense against the
bomb," he said, " is not to be there
when it goes off. It is a particular
threat to the essentially urban civili
zation of the United States, and an
immediate dispersal of our large in
dustries is necessary."
It is hard to keep things secret
long, according to Dr. Tresidder, but
the United States managed to main
tain the secrecy of radar and the
bomb-sight. He thinks, therefore,

that the United States should defi
nitely maintain secrecy on the man
ufacture and method and use of the
bomb, even though other nations,
having the idea, will probably be
able to discover the method.
Commission Recommended
"We must establish a government

commission to supervise the use of
the bomb in the United States," Dr.
Tresidder continued. "The purpose
of the commission will be to pre
vent the bomb's use for blackmail
and war and also to protect the
public safety. An atomic bomb plant
needs protection just as a dynamite
manufacturing plant does."
The bomb has tremendous de
fense implications, but its domestic
uses will be far in the future, Dr.
Tresidder said. After talking to ex
perts in the East, lie feels that there
is no imminent peacetime use; it is
now just an offensive wartime
weapon.
Military System Obsolete
Because it is such a tremendous
weapon, he thinks our whole mili
tary system should be restudicd by
a defense commission. "People used
to believe that an airplane could
never sink a battleship," he said.
"People today do not realize the
full consequences of one blast of
