CHUNGKING. Oct. 28 (UP).â€” j
Communist sources reported today '
that an undeclared civil war was |
raging in at least 11 provinces of
North China and said the Chinese |
central government has concentrated j
800,000 troops in the area to wipe
out Communist forces.
One of the major centers of
fighting, the Communists said, is in
the rich agricultural province of
Shansi, which borders inner Mon
golia to the north. Government
sources, backing up the reports of |
large-scale fighting, said 15.000 gov- |
ernment troops were killed in one J
two-weeks battle alone when Com- I
murfist troops captured the trans- !
portation town of Changehih in I
Southeastern Shansi.
Another 50,000 Communist troops j
are attacking the Talung rail junc- j
tion in North Shansi against bitter- |
ly defending government forces, ac
cording to Marshal Yen Hsi-Shan,
commander of the second war zone
and governor of Shansi.
The Central News Agency charged
that Communist forces in Honan |
province were attempting to break j
up communications there by de- ]
stroying dikes on the Yellow river,
resulting in floods which have left
1,700,000 Chinese homeless.
