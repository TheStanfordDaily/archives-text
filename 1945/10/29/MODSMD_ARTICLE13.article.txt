### 
LONDON. Oct. 28 (UP).â€”British
and French newspapers divided
their headlines and editorial com
ment on President Truman's Navy
Day speech between his statement
on the atomic bomb and his prom
ise that the United States would
maintain powerful armed forces to
aid in enforcing world peace.
London newspapers were wholly
favorable.
President Truman's foreign policy
statement was hailed as a pledge
(.hat the United States wouid do its
part as one of the United Nations.
Paris papers were somewhat skep
tical in their comment. Their tend
ency was to ask why the United
States did not share the atomic
bomb secret and the Panama Canal
if she wanted the world's riches to
be at the disposal of all peoples.
