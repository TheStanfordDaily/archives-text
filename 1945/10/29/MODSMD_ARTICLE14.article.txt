# CIO Lists Causes Of Labor Unrest
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (UP).— |
The CIO warned tonight in its
monthly economic outlook that
strikes will mount until wage rates
are increased and "fundamental
changes are made to remedy injus
tice and overcome insecurity and
suffering."
The warning was published as
President Truman prepared to ad
dress the nation at 10 p.m. EST
Tuesday on labor's demand for a i
.'{<) per cent rise in basic wage rates
and industry's counter-contention j
that such raises cannot lie granted '
withuut consequent price boosts.
The CIO asserted that the under- i
lying causes of current industrial j
unrest are:
1. The government's failure to j
keep its promise to prevent wartime
profiteering and to keep wages and
prices in balance.
2. Wages were frozen 15 per (
cent above the January 1341 level
by the Little Steel formula but
the cost of living rose per cent j
and profits after taxes tripled over |
the pre-war level.

3. Grievances accumulated be
cause companies would nol settle
them according to contract machin
ery and some companies failed to
observe seniority provisions.
4. Workers realize that the na
tion is at a turning point into
full employment or back to mass
unemployment and they fear an
other depression unless wages are
raised high enough to offset the
decline in take-home pay and
government purchases.
5. These fears are increased by
the behavior of Congress which so
far has failed to pass a single law
that offers hope of continuing full
employment.
6. Strikes by employers who
won't produce until they get high
er prices or are trying to see that
surpluses are destroyed or frozen.
The publication said that com
pulsory arbitration, such as pro
posed by the Ball-Burton-Hatch
bill, would not meet the situation
because it "places a premium on
employers' stalling tactics."
It called for a $12,000,(100 gov
ernmental program of basic eco
nomic research and said that the
success of the national labor-man
agement conference opening here
Nov. 5 "will depend upon the
willingness of both management
and the government to deal forth
l ightly with the underlying causes
of unrest."
It said that a 25 per cent basic
wage increase would restore the
relationship between wage rates,
prices and productivity that existed
in 1940 when 9.000,000 workers were
unemployed.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (UP).— |
The CIO warned tonight in its
monthly economic outlook that
strikes will mount until wage rates
are increased and "fundamental
changes are made to remedy injus
tice and overcome insecurity and
suffering."
The warning was published as
President Truman prepared to ad
dress the nation at 10 p.m. EST
Tuesday on labor's demand for a i
.'{<) per cent rise in basic wage rates
and industry's counter-contention j
that such raises cannot lie granted '
withuut consequent price boosts.
The CIO asserted that the under- i
lying causes of current industrial j
unrest are:
1. The government's failure to j
keep its promise to prevent wartime
profiteering and to keep wages and
prices in balance.
2. Wages were frozen 15 per (
cent above the January 1341 level
by the Little Steel formula but
the cost of living rose per cent j
and profits after taxes tripled over |
the pre-war level.

3. Grievances accumulated be
cause companies would nol settle
them according to contract machin
ery and some companies failed to
observe seniority provisions.

tion is at a turning point into
full employment or back to mass
unemployment and they fear an
