The Stanford football squad is
fast rounding out into shape under
the careful eye of Marcliie Schwartz.
The tricky T plays are being mas
tered by the backfield, and the line
is hitting the tackle dummies with

ferocity. The first game for the Big
Red Machine is set for Nov. 10, al
though the opponent has not been
selected yet. Games will follow on
the 17th and the first of December,
but also in those lilts the opposing
eleven remains a mystery.
No starting team has been
named >et, but some of the boys
lighting hard for the top spots on
the Indian team are Bill Larson,
a Navy quarterback; Willie Da
vies, also a quarterback; Del Tor
kelson, an end from Kansas State;
Joe Babich, an ex-St. Mary's
player; Dick Barry, a transfer
from Cal; Joe Slier, a quarter
back; and Tom Ashley, a former
Southern California prep star.
In the mailbox was a letter from
our old friend, A. Barney Gugel,
who is now attending Northwestern
University. (Barney will be re
membered for his no-hit ball game
he pitched against a Toyon team
last summer in the intramural
league.)
Ex-Old Boy Gugel sends along
a clipping from the Northwestern
Daily in which a poll was taken
on the campus for the top foot
ball teams of the nation. Bated
first was Army, then Navy, and
down in the 11th slot was none
other than Stanford! Without
fielding a team Stanford rates
among the top teams in the na
tion. Quite an honor, indeed.
Maybe Gugel stuffed the ballot
box. Hmm?
Words of advice also come from
Barney. "Here's a tip. Pick North
western to lose all the rest of its
games and you can't miss. lowa
should also lose all the rest of its
games. Illinois and Wisconsin should
get dumped by all the big teams,
but the game between them should
be a tough one to pick. I think Min
nesota is overrated, and should be
dumped by Ohio State in short
order. Picking the Big Ten games
used to be a nightmare when I was
on the sports staff, but when you
actually see the teams, you can tell
pretty much what they can do."

The Stanford football squad is
fast rounding out into shape under
the careful eye of Marcliie Schwartz.
The tricky T plays are being mas
tered by the backfield, and the line
is hitting the tackle dummies with

ferocity. The first game for the Big
Red Machine is set for Nov. 10, al
though the opponent has not been
selected yet. Games will follow on
the 17th and the first of December,
but also in those lilts the opposing
eleven remains a mystery.
No starting team has been
named >et, but some of the boys
lighting hard for the top spots on
the Indian team are Bill Larson,
a Navy quarterback; Willie Da
vies, also a quarterback; Del Tor
kelson, an end from Kansas State;
Joe Babich, an ex-St. Mary's
player; Dick Barry, a transfer
from Cal; Joe Slier, a quarter
back; and Tom Ashley, a former
Southern California prep star.
In the mailbox was a letter from
our old friend, A. Barney Gugel,
who is now attending Northwestern
University. (Barney will be re
membered for his no-hit ball game
he pitched against a Toyon team
last summer in the intramural
league.)
Ex-Old Boy Gugel sends along
a clipping from the Northwestern
Daily in which a poll was taken
on the campus for the top foot
ball teams of the nation. Bated
first was Army, then Navy, and
down in the 11th slot was none
other than Stanford! Without
fielding a team Stanford rates
among the top teams in the na
tion. Quite an honor, indeed.
Maybe Gugel stuffed the ballot
box. Hmm?
Words of advice also come from
Barney. "Here's a tip. Pick North
western to lose all the rest of its
games and you can't miss. lowa
should also lose all the rest of its
games. Illinois and Wisconsin should
get dumped by all the big teams,
but the game between them should
be a tough one to pick. I think Min
nesota is overrated, and should be
dumped by Ohio State in short
order. Picking the Big Ten games
used to be a nightmare when I was
on the sports staff, but when you
actually see the teams, you can tell
pretty much what they can do."
