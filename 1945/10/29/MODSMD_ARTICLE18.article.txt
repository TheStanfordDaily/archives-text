WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (UP).â€”
The United Nations Relief and Re
habilitation Administration was as
sured of Republican support to
night despite what the GOP termed
"inefficiency, political intrigue, mis
management and downright poor
administration."
The House Republican food study
committee reported to Republican
Floor Leader Joseph W. Martin,
Mass., that United States UNRRA
contributions must be continued for
"our own security and self-inter
est' and "to relieve the desperate
plight of those people who were
lately our allies."
The report recommended con
gressional approval, "without de
lay," of legislation coming before
the House this week to provide an
additional $550,000,000 of U.S. funds
for UNRRA, and said this country
should provide "any additional
amount found reasonably neces
sary" for relief this winter.
