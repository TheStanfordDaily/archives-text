# United Nations Should Rule Atomic Power, Says Stuart
## 
### 
"Give the United Nations a
ehancc" is the suggestion of Dr.
Graham H. Stuart, professor of po
litical science, for the control of the
atomic bomb. "Here is an organiza
tion already set up to handle just
such a situation as the release of
atomic power. A designated unit of
the organization can have charge of
seeing that the bomb is not produced
in ;iny country. This would in
volve not just but also po
lice patrol.
"The League of Nations, which is
acknowledged to have been much
more faulty than the present United
Nations, managed to prevent the use
of poison gas and bacteriological
warfare. But in that instance as in
this the most potent counter-weapon
was fear of the disastrous conse
quences. The best course is to con
tinue to spread democracy as we
have been trying to do. The people
won't be inclined to use such a force
against themselves."
Foreign Policy Affected
In connection with his own field,
Dr. Stuart believes that the utiliza

tion of atomic energy for destruc
tion revolutionizes both the conduct
and content of foreign policy. As
regards procedure, security, which
is the vital requirement for a suc
cessful foreign policy, must hence
forth depend more upon the foreign
office and less upon the armed
forces.
"The claim to be the first line of
defense long disputed by the diplo
mat and the soldier is now clearly
within the domain of the diplomat,"
Dr. Stuart said. "The essential
problem henceforth is to prevent
wars, not t(3 wage them success
fully. What bodes success if both
disputants arc destroyed in the
process?
Eliminate Disputes
"But to prevent wars it is neces
sary both to try to eliminate dis
putes before they become serious
and if that fails, to have adequate
and efTective machinery to require
their settlement by peaceable meth
ods. In other the foreign
office and the diplomatic corps must
be built up and given every facility
first to formulate a wise and just

foreign policy wherein duties as well
as rights are recognized.
"In the second place," he contin
ues, "an equally efficient foreign
service is required to eliminate po
tential friction on the spot and to
report with such intelligence that
the foreign office will have both ac
curate information and the reasoned
judgement upon which to act."
Arbitrate Disputes
If the foreign office and diplomatic
corps reach an impasse, no longer
shall the two powers concerned be
permitted to resort to war, thereby
jeopardizing the very existence of
all neighboring states. The atomic
bomb is no respecter of either nat
ural or artificial frontiers. It must
be required of all disputing states
that they submit their differences
to some international judicial or
conciliating agency. And once sub
mitted, the ward must be acccptcd.
This, lie believes, requires an effec
tive international organization with
adequate machinery for the settle
ment of disputes and effective sanc
tions to enforce its finding.
Principles of Justice
"Now," Dr. Stuart continues, "just,
a word as regards the changed con
tent of foreign affairs. For centuries
international law has been develop
ing in the direction of the universal
recognition and acceptance of cer
tain fundamental principles of jus-

I lice.
i"The moral or ethical basis of in
ternational law has constantly ex
tended. Even in war efforts have
been made to humanize procedure.
Bomb Nullifies Progress
"The atomic bomb nullifies all
such progress. No longer would
bombing be limited to war indus
trial areas. The entire city with its
non-combatant men, women, and
children would be wiped out. The
direful effects upon those injured
but not killed would be disregarded.
The advantage henceforth is with
the aggressor and the more ruthless
the aggressor the greater chance of
immediate victory. The quick-act
ing autocratic or totalitarian state
has an incredible advantage over the
slow-moving democracy.
"At last civilized society has
reached the parting of the ways.
Either justice, co-operation, and
peace will permit a constantly im
proving standard of living both
physically and spiritually, or injus
tice, selfish nationalism, and war will
bring either chaos or annihilation."

GRAHAM STUART
"Give the United Nations a
ehancc" is the suggestion of Dr.
Graham H. Stuart, professor of po
litical science, for the control of the
atomic bomb. "Here is an organiza
tion already set up to handle just
such a situation as the release of
atomic power. A designated unit of
the organization can have charge of
seeing that the bomb is not produced
in ;iny country. This would in
volve not just but also po
lice patrol.
"The League of Nations, which is
acknowledged to have been much
more faulty than the present United
Nations, managed to prevent the use
of poison gas and bacteriological
warfare. But in that instance as in
this the most potent counter-weapon
was fear of the disastrous conse
quences. The best course is to con
tinue to spread democracy as we
have been trying to do. The people
won't be inclined to use such a force
against themselves."
Foreign Policy Affected
In connection with his own field,
Dr. Stuart believes that the utiliza

tion of atomic energy for destruc
tion revolutionizes both the conduct
and content of foreign policy. As
regards procedure, security, which
is the vital requirement for a suc
cessful foreign policy, must hence
forth depend more upon the foreign
office and less upon the armed
forces.
"The claim to be the first line of
defense long disputed by the diplo
mat and the soldier is now clearly
within the domain of the diplomat,"
Dr. Stuart said. "The essential
problem henceforth is to prevent
wars, not t(3 wage them success
fully. What bodes success if both
disputants arc destroyed in the
process?
Eliminate Disputes
"But to prevent wars it is neces
sary both to try to eliminate dis
putes before they become serious
and if that fails, to have adequate
and efTective machinery to require
their settlement by peaceable meth
ods. In other the foreign
office and the diplomatic corps must
be built up and given every facility
first to formulate a wise and just

foreign policy wherein duties as well
as rights are recognized.
"In the second place," he contin
ues, "an equally efficient foreign
service is required to eliminate po
tential friction on the spot and to
report with such intelligence that
the foreign office will have both ac
curate information and the reasoned
judgement upon which to act."

If the foreign office and diplomatic
corps reach an impasse, no longer

have been trying to do. The people
won't be inclined to use such a force
against themselves."
Foreign Policy Affected
In connection with his own field,
Dr. Stuart believes that the utiliza

tion of atomic energy for destruc
tion revolutionizes both the conduct
and content of foreign policy. As
regards procedure, security, which
is the vital requirement for a suc
cessful foreign policy, must hence
forth depend more upon the foreign
office and less upon the armed
forces.
"The claim to be the first line of
defense long disputed by the diplo
mat and the soldier is now clearly
within the domain of the diplomat,"
Dr. Stuart said. "The essential
problem henceforth is to prevent
wars, not t(3 wage them success
fully. What bodes success if both
disputants arc destroyed in the
process?
Eliminate Disputes
"But to prevent wars it is neces
sary both to try to eliminate dis
putes before they become serious
and if that fails, to have adequate
and efTective machinery to require
their settlement by peaceable meth
ods. In other the foreign
office and the diplomatic corps must
be built up and given every facility
first to formulate a wise and just

foreign policy wherein duties as well
as rights are recognized.
"In the second place," he contin
ues, "an equally efficient foreign
service is required to eliminate po
tential friction on the spot and to
report with such intelligence that
the foreign office will have both ac
curate information and the reasoned
judgement upon which to act."
Arbitrate Disputes
If the foreign office and diplomatic
corps reach an impasse, no longer
shall the two powers concerned be
permitted to resort to war, thereby
jeopardizing the very existence of
all neighboring states. The atomic
bomb is no respecter of either nat
ural or artificial frontiers. It must
be required of all disputing states
that they submit their differences
to some international judicial or
conciliating agency. And once sub
mitted, the ward must be acccptcd.
This, lie believes, requires an effec
tive international organization with
adequate machinery for the settle
ment of disputes and effective sanc
tions to enforce its finding.
Principles of Justice
"Now," Dr. Stuart continues, "just,
a word as regards the changed con
tent of foreign affairs. For centuries
international law has been develop
ing in the direction of the universal
recognition and acceptance of cer
tain fundamental principles of jus-

I lice.
i"The moral or ethical basis of in
ternational law has constantly ex
tended. Even in war efforts have
been made to humanize procedure.
Bomb Nullifies Progress
"The atomic bomb nullifies all
such progress. No longer would
bombing be limited to war indus
trial areas. The entire city with its
non-combatant men, women, and
children would be wiped out. The
direful effects upon those injured
but not killed would be disregarded.
The advantage henceforth is with
the aggressor and the more ruthless
the aggressor the greater chance of
immediate victory. The quick-act
ing autocratic or totalitarian state
has an incredible advantage over the
slow-moving democracy.
"At last civilized society has
reached the parting of the ways.
Either justice, co-operation, and
peace will permit a constantly im
proving standard of living both
physically and spiritually, or injus
tice, selfish nationalism, and war will
bring either chaos or annihilation."
