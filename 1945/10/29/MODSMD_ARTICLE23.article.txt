# Davies Explains Recent British Socialistic Trend
## 
### 
"II Britain and the United State
can't work together and can't get
peace, our children might as well
commit suicide now and be done
with it."
Rhys Davies, prominent British
Labour Party leader and member of
Parliament, made this plea for a co
operative peace when he discussed
"Issues in Anglo-American Rela
tions" last Friday evening at the
Episcopal Parish House in Palo Alto.
Million Homes Blasted
"War," he said, "is 150.000 London
ers sleeping underground for four
years, one million homes blasted
down to the ground, and 2,000 homes
destroyed in one night in Manches
ter. The language of war is "Who's
been killed?—day after day."
"War," Mr. Davis added, "has
never settled any problem satisfac
torily." He pointed out that Britain
did not enter the conflict to save
Poland or "gallant little Belgium,"
but to preserve the balance of pow
er in Europe. "We ended up," he
said, "with one man wielding more
influence over Europe than Napol
eon, the Kaiser, Hitler, or Musso
lini ever had."
British General Elections
In discussing the recent British
general election, Mr. Davies pointed
out that the British people realized
the necessity of abolishing wars for
ever, and that they wanted a leader,
not hindered by hatred and ani
mosity, to make a just and lasting
peace.
"Churchill himself," Mr. Davies
remarked, "has said that a war lead
er cannot make a decent peace." He

; added that the result of the election
was in no way a condemnation of
Winston Churchill.
"Nothing shall detract from
Churchill's ability or success as an
orator, a leader, and a statesman in
time of war," Mr. Davies said. "We
have tens of thousands of Churchills
and Atlees in England. I would like
to destroy the conception that a na
tion's destiny lepends on one man or
one group of men."
Nationalization of Bank
Mr. Davies explained that the So

cialist Labour Partes program called
for the nationalization of the Bank
of England and the nation's coal
mines. He claimed that England has
been traveling toward socialism for
many years, and he used the Brit
ish Broadcasting System, the London
Transport System, and other city
control of public utilities as ex
amples.
Mr. Davies added that America's
concern and fright over the result
of the election was due to a fear of
words. "England's socialism is not
Marxian socialism," he said. "The
Labour Party rejects the idea of the
use of force for anything. England
has shown that you can overthrow
a ruling party without violence."
In closing. Mr. Davies made a plea
for Anglo-American cooperation for
a "peace based on justice." "Capital
ism, greed, selfishness, and money
making are behind every war," he
said. Let those who desire that fight
their own wars and not call on the
18 year old boys to do it for them,"
he ended.—Mary Virginia Pond.

British General Elections
In discussing the recent British
general election, Mr. Davies pointed
out that the British people realized
the necessity of abolishing wars for
ever, and that they wanted a leader,
not hindered by hatred and ani
mosity, to make a just and lasting
peace.
"Churchill himself," Mr. Davies
remarked, "has said that a war lead
er cannot make a decent peace." He

; added that the result of the election
was in no way a condemnation of
Winston Churchill.
"Nothing shall detract from
Churchill's ability or success as an
orator, a leader, and a statesman in
time of war," Mr. Davies said. "We
have tens of thousands of Churchills
and Atlees in England. I would like
to destroy the conception that a na
tion's destiny lepends on one man or
one group of men."
Nationalization of Bank
Mr. Davies explained that the So

cialist Labour Partes program called
for the nationalization of the Bank
of England and the nation's coal
mines. He claimed that England has
been traveling toward socialism for
many years, and he used the Brit
ish Broadcasting System, the London
Transport System, and other city
control of public utilities as ex
amples.
Mr. Davies added that America's
concern and fright over the result
of the election was due to a fear of
words. "England's socialism is not
Marxian socialism," he said. "The
Labour Party rejects the idea of the
use of force for anything. England
has shown that you can overthrow
a ruling party without violence."
In closing. Mr. Davies made a plea
for Anglo-American cooperation for
a "peace based on justice." "Capital
ism, greed, selfishness, and money
making are behind every war," he
said. Let those who desire that fight
their own wars and not call on the
18 year old boys to do it for them,"
he ended.—Mary Virginia Pond.
"II Britain and the United State
can't work together and can't get
peace, our children might as well
commit suicide now and be done
with it."
Rhys Davies, prominent British
Labour Party leader and member of
Parliament, made this plea for a co
operative peace when he discussed
"Issues in Anglo-American Rela
tions" last Friday evening at the
Episcopal Parish House in Palo Alto.
Million Homes Blasted
"War," he said, "is 150.000 London
ers sleeping underground for four
years, one million homes blasted
down to the ground, and 2,000 homes
destroyed in one night in Manches
ter. The language of war is "Who's
been killed?—day after day."
"War," Mr. Davis added, "has
never settled any problem satisfac
torily." He pointed out that Britain
did not enter the conflict to save
Poland or "gallant little Belgium,"
but to preserve the balance of pow
er in Europe. "We ended up," he
said, "with one man wielding more
influence over Europe than Napol
eon, the Kaiser, Hitler, or Musso
lini ever had."
