# Dangerous To Retain Atomic Secret—Fisher
## 
### 
Isolationists say, "Keep it secret;
take no chances with atomic power."
"Such attitudes are not only futile;
they arc positively dangerous," com
mented Dr. Harold Fisher, Chair
man of Directors of the Hoover
Library. "It is impossible, accord
ing to scientists, to keep this dis
covery a secret; and any attempt to
do so undermines world security by
arousing fear and by lessening con
fidence in our good faith."
Now is the time to establish the
practice that atomic energy shall be
used for human welfare, not for
war, Dr. Fisher says. Correctly
handled it will be a great incentive
for international cooperation.
Must Act Now!
The United States must take the
initiative while we still control the
secret. America must say, "We will
use this discovery for the good of

man." This decisive act would
eventually make available sources of
power that have never before been
used and materially lessen the needs
of "have not" nations. With every
added use atomic power could thus
decrease causes of war and conse
quently the danger of atomic de
struction.
No Atomic Weapons
Even while we prepare to use
atomic energy, Dr. Fisher believes
that it would be wise to make in
ternational agreements against us
ing it for weapons of war. At the
same time we should set up a sys
tem of checking any deviation from
this policy. He thinks that such
agreements would be successful if
accompanied by the positive use of
atomic energy ty better the human
lot.
He disagrees with people who
i think we must stave ofT the Atomic
Age until we have replaced present
national governments with a new
vvorld government.
World Government Later
First, we cannot visualize the per
fect world government now. We
cannot predict what form would be
most effective in the new and un
explored Atomic Age. The attempt
to do so would be comparable to
the effort of an ancient Egyptian
to create the 20th century constitu
tion.
Second, it would be impossible to
establish such a government until
systems as different as those of
Russia, China, and the United States
have developed enough tolerance
to be ready to live in the same
world. Dr. Fisher argues that men
change institutions only when the
new ones are obviously more prac
tical. World government must come
spontaneously after people are con
vinced they want it.
Path To Unity
The United Nations Charter will
; give us a taste of world unity. The
' actual use of atomic energy will
| compel \ the establishment and use
of world institutions and tend to ac
custom the people of the world to
the thought of one government. Dr.
Fisher believes that we should sup
port this Charter and let it prove its
good points.
He warns that there will be tre
mendous opposition to the idea of
putting atomic energy to work.
Varied economic and political in
terests will fear its effects on the
organizations with which they are
connected. People must be con
vinced that this new thing holds I
greater good than the system which j
it replaces.—Lisa Ebberts.

World Government Later
First, we cannot visualize the per
fect world government now. We
cannot predict what form would be
most effective in the new and un
explored Atomic Age. The attempt
to do so would be comparable to
the effort of an ancient Egyptian
to create the 20th century constitu
tion.
Second, it would be impossible to
establish such a government until
systems as different as those of
Russia, China, and the United States
have developed enough tolerance
to be ready to live in the same
world. Dr. Fisher argues that men
change institutions only when the
new ones are obviously more prac
tical. World government must come
spontaneously after people are con
vinced they want it.
Path To Unity
The United Nations Charter will
; give us a taste of world unity. The
' actual use of atomic energy will

of world institutions and tend to ac
custom the people of the world to
the thought of one government. Dr.
Fisher believes that we should sup
port this Charter and let it prove its
good points.
He warns that there will be tre
mendous opposition to the idea of

Isolationists say, "Keep it secret;
take no chances with atomic power."
"Such attitudes are not only futile;
they arc positively dangerous," com
mented Dr. Harold Fisher, Chair
man of Directors of the Hoover
Library. "It is impossible, accord
ing to scientists, to keep this dis
covery a secret; and any attempt to
do so undermines world security by
arousing fear and by lessening con
fidence in our good faith."
Now is the time to establish the
practice that atomic energy shall be
used for human welfare, not for
war, Dr. Fisher says. Correctly
handled it will be a great incentive
for international cooperation.
Must Act Now!
The United States must take the
initiative while we still control the
secret. America must say, "We will
use this discovery for the good of

man." This decisive act would
eventually make available sources of
power that have never before been
used and materially lessen the needs
of "have not" nations. With every
added use atomic power could thus
decrease causes of war and conse
quently the danger of atomic de
struction.
No Atomic Weapons
Even while we prepare to use
atomic energy, Dr. Fisher believes
that it would be wise to make in
ternational agreements against us
ing it for weapons of war. At the
same time we should set up a sys
tem of checking any deviation from
this policy. He thinks that such
