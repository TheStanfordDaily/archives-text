# Chilean Party Tours Campus
## 
### 
"Your campus reminds me a great
deal of Chile," said President Juan
Antonio Rios of Chile yesterday,
when he and a large party of Chil
ean dignitaries visited Stanford as
the guests of Dr. Donald B. Tresid
der, Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, and Dr.
Ronald Hilton.
President Rios expressed his in
terest in Stanford, and he thought
it was very "unusual." He felt very
much at home, he said, because the
country and the Spanish buildings
were very much like those in Chile.
The visitors were much inter
ested in the subjects taught at
Stanford and they were amazed
that the curriculum was so broad.
Dr. Hilton acted as interpreter
for much of the conversation be
tween the hosts and the guests.
Among the party touring the
United States were Marcial Mora,
Chilean Ambassador to this coun
try; Eleadoro Dominguez, Senator;
Raul Banos, Deputy, Benjamin Cla
ro-Velasco, former Minister of Ed
ucation, and Lieutenant Carlos Rios,
son of the President. Brigadier
General Milton A. Hill, American
Army aide, and Captain G. F. M.
Mentz, American naval aide, accom
panied the party.
The distinguished group visited
the Hoover War Library, and were
shown the important buildings 011
the campus from the tower. They
then proceeded to the Frost Am
phitheater and the Memorial
Church, and finally visited Lagu
nita Court.
President Rios was first invited to
visit the United States by President
Roosevelt, and President Truman
extended the invitation again. This
is the first time a Chilean President
has ever visited this country while
he was still in office.
