# Modern Man Is Obsolete

The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
