# Modern Man Is Obsolete
## 
### 
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*

him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces

MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.

views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re

solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-

medical knowledge might accrue to

son why mobilized research should

Nor is there any reason why even

(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so

Once again, if man wills it, he

first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
The editorial appearing on this page was written by Norman
Cousins in the August 18 edition' of the Saturday Review oi
Literature. (Now in book form.) The Daily considers it so vital
that it reprints it in its entirety, with the hope that every Stanford
student and faculty member, and also those outside the Univer
sity reads it through to the e*id.
The atomic bomb and its control is the most important prob
lem in this world today. One person or one group alone cannot
hope to impress this fact upon the citizens of a nation that holds
a temporary advantage in the science of death. Treaties cannot
hold the atomic bomb. The initiative, the will must come from
the people.
In addition to Mr. Cousins' editorial The Daily prints inter
views with men of Stanford who are universally known in their
fields. Their opinions represent many of the complexities of
the problem and, above all, the necessity for immediate, posi
tive action on a question of life or death of the human race.The
Editor.

Whatever elation there is in the
world today because of final vic
tory in the war is severely tcmp j
ercd by fear. It is a primitive
tear, the fear of the unknown, the
tear of forces man can neither
channel nor comprehend. This
fear is not new; in its classical
form it is the fear of irrational
death. But overnight it has become
intensified, magnified.
It has burst out of the subcon
scious and into the conscious, filling
the mind with primordial appre
hensions. It is thus that man
stumbles fitfully into a new age of
atomic energy for which he is as ill
equipped to acccpt its potential
blessings as he is to counteract or
control its present dangers.
ONLY FEAR AND EXTINCTION?
Where man can find no answer,
he will find fear. While the dust was
still settling over Hiroshima, he was
asking himself questions and finding
no answers. The biggest question
of these concerns the nature of
man. Is war in the nature of man?
If so, how much time has he left
before he employs the means he
has already devised for the ultimate
in self-destruction—extinction?

And now thai the scicncc of
warfare has reached the point
where it threatens the planet it
self, is it possible that man is
destined to return the earth to
its aboriginal incandescent mass
blazing at fifty million degrees.
If not—that is, if war is not in the
nature of man—then how is he
to interpret his own experience,
which tells hiirt that in all of re
corded history there have been
only .'>oo years in the aggregate
during which he has been free of
war?
Closely following upon these are
other questions, flowing out end
lessly from his fears and without
prospcct of definitive answer.
CHANGES WILL COME
Even assuming that lie could hold
destructive science in check, what
changes would the new age bring
or demand in his everyday life?
What changes would it bring or de
mand in his culture, his education,
his philosophy, his religion, his re
lationships with other human be
ings?
In speculating upon these ques
tions, it should not be necessary
In prove thai on August (i, 1045, a
new ui',i' was born. When on that
da\ i parachute containing a small
object floated to earth over Japan,
if marked the violent death of one
stage in man's history and the J
beginning of another.
N<should it be necessary to
prove the saturating effect of the
in'w .. i\ pirnieating every aspect of
man'. 1 activities, from machines to
moral'-:, from physics to philosophy,
from politics to poetry; in sum, it is
an effect creating a blanket of ob
solescence not only over the meth
ods and the products of man but
over man himself.
MEN AM) ANTS
If is a curious phenomenon of
nature that only two species prac
tice the art of war—men and ants,
both of which, ironically, maintain
complex social organizations. This j
dor not mean that only men and
ants engage in the murder of theii :
own kind.
Many animals of the same spe- j
cits kill each other, but only men |
and ants have practiced (he sci- j
enet of organized destruction, em
ploying their massed numbers in
violent combat and relying on j
strategy and tactics to meet de- j
vi loping situations or to capital- j
i/e «>n the weaknesses in the strat
egy and tactics of the other side.
The longest continuous war ever
Jon Jit between men lasted thirty
y<ai The longest ant war ever
ree-ii'.led lasted .six and a half weeks,
or whatever the corresponding units
Would - be in ant reckoning.
IS WAR INSTINCT!VE?
It is encouraging to note that t
•w!ii!' all entomologists are agreed
that war is instinctive with ants, not
all , nthropologists and biologists j
are agreed that war is instinctive
with men.
I he strict empiricists, of course,
find everything in man's history to
indicate that war is locked up
witii his nature. But a broader
ami more generous, certainly
more philosophical, view is held
by those scientists who claim that
the evidence to date is incomplete
and misleading, and that man
does have within him the power
of abolishing war.
Prominent among these is Julian
Huxley, who draws a sharp distinc
tion between human nature and
the expression of human nature.
Thus war is not a reflection but an
xpression of his nature. Moreover,
the expression may change, as the
factors which lead to war may
change. "In man, as in ants, war
in any serious sense is bound up
with the existence of accumula
tion'- of property to fight about."
MAN CAN Hl'] MOLDED
A. for human nature, it contains
no specific war instinct, as does the
nature of harvester ants. There is
in man's makeup a general aggres
sive tendency, but this, like all oth
er human urges, is not a specific
and unvarying instinct; it can be
molded into the most varied forms."
Hut even if this gives us a re
assuring answer to the question—
is war inevitable because of man's
nature? — it still leaves unan
sw( red the question concerning
the causes leading up to war. The
expression of man's nature will
continue to be warlike if the same
conditions are continued that have
provoked warlike expressons in
him in the past. And since man's
survival on earth is now abso
lutely dependent on his ability to
avoid a new war. he is faced with ;
the so-far insoluble problem of
climi.iating those causes.
THE ( OMPETITIVE IMPULSE
In the most primitive sense, war
in man is an expression of his com
petitive impulses. Like verything
< lsc in nature, he has had to fight
for existence; but ihc battle against
other animals, once won, gave way
in his evolution to battle against his
own kind. Darwin called it the sur
vival of the fittest, and its most
overstretched interpretation is to
be found in "Mein Kampf with its
naked glodification of brute force
and the complete worship of might
makes right.
In the political and national
sense, it lias been the attempt of
the "have-nots" to take from the
"haves," or the attempt of the
"haves" to add further to their hit
at the expense of the "have-nots."
Not always was property at stake:
comparative advantages were meas
ured in terms of power, and in terms
of tribal or national superiority. The
good luck of one nation became the
hard luek of another. The good
fortune of the Western powers in
obtaining "concessions" in China at '

the turn of the century was the ill
fortune of the Chinese. The power
that Germany stripped from Aus
tria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
France at the beginning of World
War II she added to her own.
VICIOUS 15V CHOICE?
What does it matter, then, if
war is not in the nature of man
so long as man continues through
the expression of his nature to be
a viciously competitive animal? The
effect is the same, and therefore the
result must be as conclusive—war
being the effect, and complete ob
literation of the human species be
ing the remit.
If this reasoning is correct, then
modern man is obsolete, a self
made anachronism becoming more
incongruous by the minute. He
has exalted change in everything
hut himself. He has leaped cen
turies ahead in inventing a new
world to live in, but he knows
little or nothing about his own
part in that world.
He has surrounded and con
founded himself with gaps — gaps
between revolutionary science and
evolutionary anthropology, between
cosmic gadgets and humac wisdom,
intellect and conscience. The strug
gle between science and morals that
Ilenry Thomas Buckle foresaw a
century ago has been all but won
by science.
Given time, man might h* ex
pected to bridge those gaps nor
mally; but by his own hand, he is
destroying even time. Communica
tion, transportation, war no longer
wait on time. Decision and execu
tion in the modern world are be
coming virtually synchronous. Thus,
whatever bridges man has to build
and cross he shall have to build and
cross immediately.
BIOLOGY AND WILL
This involves both biology and
will. If he lacks the actual and po
tential biological equipment to build
those bridges, then the birth certifi
cate of the atomic age is in reality a
"memento mori." But even if he
possesses ihc necessary biological
equipment, he must still make the
decision which says that he is to
apply himself to the challenge. Ca
pability without decision is inaction
and inconsequence.
Man is left, then, with a crisis
in decision. The main test before
him involves his will to change
rather than his ability to change.
That he is capable of change is
ccrtain. For there is no more
mutable or adaptable animal in
the world.
We have seen him migrate from
one extreme clime to another. We
have seen him step out of backward
societies and join advanced groups.
We have seen, within the space of
a single generation, tribes of head
hunters spurn their acephalous pas
times and rituals and become pur
veyors of the Western arts.
This is not to imply that the
change was necessary for the better;
only that change was possible.
Changeability with the headhunters
proceeded from external pressure
and fear of punishment, true, and
was only secondarily a matter of
voluntary decision. But the stimu
lus was there; and mankind today
need look no further for stimulus
than its own desire to stay alive.
The critical power of change, says
Spengler, is directly linked to the
survival drive. Once the instinct for
survival is stimulated, the basic
condition for change can be met.
WE MUST REALIZE Till] PERIL
That is why the quintessence of
destruction as potentially repre
sented by modern science must be
dramatized and kept in the fore
front of public opinion. The full
dimensions of the peril must be
seen and recognized. Then and only
then will man realize that the first
order of business is the question of
continued existence. Then and only
then will he be prepared to make
the decisions necessary to assure
that survival.
In making these decisions, there
arc two principal courses that arc
open (o him. Both will keep him
alive for an indefinite or at least
a reasonably long period. These
courses, however, are directly
contradictory and represent polar
extremes of approach.
The first course is the positive ap
proach. It begins with a careful
survey and appraisal of the obso
lescences which constitute the after
birth of the new age. The survey
must begin with man himself. "The
proper study of Mankind is Man,"
said Pope.
No amount of tinkering with his
institutions will be sufficient to
insure his survival unless he can
make the necessary adjustments

•n his own relationship to the
world and to society.
The first adjustment of mutation
needed in the expression of his na
ture, to use Huxley's words, is his
savagely competitive impulses. In
the pre-atomic age, those impulses
were natural and occasionally jus
tifiable, though they often led to
war.
But the rise of materialistic man
had reasons behind it and must be
viewed against its natural setting.
Lyell, Spencer, Darwin, Lamarck,
Malthus, and others have concerned
themselves with various aspects of
this natural setting, but its domi
nant feature was an insufficiency of
the goods and the needs of life.
From Biblical history right up
through the present, there was nev
er a time when starvation and eco
nomic suffering were not acute
somewhere in the world.
ECONOMICS ONLY PART
This is only part of the story, of
course, for it is dangerous to apply
an economic interpretation indis
criminately to all history. Politics,
religion, force for force's sake, jeal
ousy, ambition, love of conquest,
love of reform—all these and others
have figured in the equations of his
tory and war. But the economic fac
tor was seldom if ever absent, even
when it was not the prime mover.
Populations frequently in
creased more rapidly than avail
able land, goods, or wealth. Mal
thas believed that they increased
so rapidly at times that war or
plague becomes nature's safety
valve. This interpretation has
undergone some revision, but it
is not the interpretation but the
circumstances that raise the prob
lem.
Yet all this has been—or can be—
changed by the new age. Man now
has it within his grasp to emanci
pate himself economically. If he
wills it, lie is in a position to refine
his competitive impulse; he can take
the step fom competitive man to
co-operative man. He has at last
unlocked enough of the earth's se
crets to provide for his needs on a
world scale.
The same atomic and electrical
energy that can destroy a city can
also usher in an age of economic
sufficiency. It need no longer be a
question as to which peoples shall
prosper and which shall be deprived.
There is power enough and re
sources enough for all.
MOBILIZE FOR LIFE
It is here that man's survey of
himself needs the severest scrutiny,
for he is his own greatest obstacle
to the achievement of those attain
able and necessary goals. While he
is willing to mobilize all his scien
tific and intellectual energies for
purposes ol death, he is unwilling
to undertake any comparable mo
bilization for purposes of life. He
has shattered Ihe atom and har
nessed its fabulous power to a bomb,
but he balks—or allows himself to
be balked—when it comes to har
nessing that power for human prog
ress.
Already, many representatives
of industry have counseled words
of synthetic caution, informing a
puzzled public that we shall not
sec the practical application of
atomic energy for general use in
our lifetime.
If it works out this way it will not
be because of any lack of knowledge
or skill, but only because of the
fear in certain quarters that atomic
energy \vill mean a complete re
vamping of the economic structure,
with the probability that it would
be operated as a government utility
of public service.
OBSOLETE INSTITUTIONS
This is not a matter of urging a
change away from the present eco
nomic structure just for the sake of
change; it is recognition of a hard
new fact of life that has made that
economic structure obsolete in an
atomic age just as it has made prac
tically all our other institutions ob
solete.
The cry is certain to go up against
further government experimenta
tion with atomic energy for peace
time purposes, and industry will de
mand that government withdraw
and give it the right to carry on its
own experiments.
These experiments, however,
would most likely be no more
consequential than the atomic
bomb would have been if left to
decentralized chance. Moreover,
it takes enthusiasm to fertilize in
vention. and there is as yet little
discernible enthusiasm for atomic
energy in those quarters which
are asking for the right to sponsor
its peace-time uses.
However understandable this lack
of enthusiasm may be, it should not
blind public opinion to the critical
importance of having research for
practical use carried on with the
same urgency, the same fullness, the
same scope and intensity as it has
been for war ends thus far.
THE SIZE OF PROMISE
The size of the opportunity is ex
ceeded only by the size of the prom
ise. But even as man stands on the
threshold of a new age, he is being
pulled back by his coat tails and told
to look the other way, told that he
must not allow his imaginaton to
get out of hand—all this at a time
when he should know almost in
stinctively that if he can put the
same courage, daring, imagination,
ingenuity, and skill that he demon
strated in winning the war into
meeting the problems of the new
age, he can win the peace as well.
He must believe, 100, that mn-
I>ili;-a tit ■it ■ i «.f .....I I I

edge in peace should not he con- |
fined to cosmic forces, hut must
he extended to liis other needs,
principally health. What a fantas
tic irony that organized science
knows the secret of the atom hut
as yet knows not a lis ahout the
common cold!
Who can tell what advances in j
medical knowledge might accrue to
the welfare of mankind if as much
mobilized effort were put into the
study of man as there had been of
matter! Cancer, heart disease, ne- |
phritis, leukemia, encephalitis, po
liomyelitis, arteriosclerosis, aplastic
anemia—all these are anomalies in
the modern world; there is no rea
son why mobilized research should
not he directed at their causes and
cure.
Nor is there any reason why even
old age should not be regarded as a
disease to be attacked by science in
(he same intensive fashion.
TIME TO THINK
Surveying other adjustments he
shall have to make if he chooses the
positive course, man must consider
himself in relation to his individual
development. He can have the lim
itless opportunities that come with
time to think. The trend during the
last fifty years toward shorter work
weeks and shorter hours will not
only b? continued but sharply ac
celerated.
Not more than half of each week
will he spent earning a living.
Mill a revolution is needed in his
leisure-time activities—which so
far have come to he associated al
most entirely with the commodi
ties of vended amusement.
Once before, the world knew a
Golden Age where the development
of the individual—his mind and his
body—was considered the first law
of life. In Greece, it took the form
of the revolution of awareness, the
emancipation of the intellect from
the limitations of corroding igno
rance and prejudice.
Revolution in Appoach
Once again, if man wills it, he
can be in a position to restore that
first law of life. But he shall have
to effect a radical transformation in
his approach to and philosophy of
education, which must prepare him
for the opportunities and responsi
bilities not only of his chosen work
but for the business of living itself.
The primary aim should he the
development of a critical intelli
gence. The futile war now go
ing on between specialization and
general study must he stopped.
There need no longer he any con
flict between the two. The indi
vidual will need both—speciali
zation fo the requirements of re
search, general knowledge for the
requirements of living.
As for the problem of time in
which to accomplish these dual ob
jectives, fomalized education until
the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year is
doubtless indicated; but it should
not abruptly end there.
Education, like the capacity of the
mind itself, has no rigid boundaries.
Unlimited exploration should lie the
first imperative of any educational
program.
A WORLD MAN NEEDED
We have saved for last the most
crucial aspect of this general sur
vey relating to the first course: the
transformation or adjustment from
national man to world man. Al
ready he has become a world war
rior; it is but one additional step—
ihough a long one—for him to de
velop a world conscience. This is
not vaporous idealism, but sheer
driving necessity. It bears directly
on the prospects of his own sur
vival. He shall have to recognize
the fiat truth that the greatest ob
solescence of all in the atomic age
is national sovereignty.
Even back in the old-fashioned
rocket age before August fi, 1!)45,
strict national sovereignty was an
anomalous and preposterous hold
over from the trilial instinct in
nations. If it was anomalous then,
it is the quintessence of anomaly
now.
The world is a geographic entity.
This is not only the basic requisite
for world government but the basic
reason behind the need. A common
ground of destiny is not too large
a site for the founding of any com
munity.
BUILDINC, ON SOAPBUBBLES
Reject all other arguments for
real world government—reject the
economic, the ideological, the socio
logical, the humanitarian arguments,
valid though they may be. Con
sider only the towering problem of
policing the atom—the problem of
keeping ihe smallest particle of mat
ter from destroying all matter.
We are liuilding on soaphuhhlcs
if we expect this problem to he
automatically solved by having
America, Britain, and Canada
keep the secret to themselves.
That is not only highly improb
able, but would in itself stimulate
the other nations to under
take whatever additional research
might he necessary over their
present experimentation to yield
the desired results.
In all history, there is not a single
instance of a new weapon being kept
exclusively by any power or powers;
sooner or later either the basic prin
ciples become generally known or
parallel devices are invented.
Before long, the atomic bomb will
follow the jet plane, the rocket
bomb, radar, and the flame thrower
into general circulation. We must
not forget that we were not the
only horse in the atomic derby; we
just happneed to finish first. The
others will be along in due time.

THE NEW LURE OF WAR
Nor can we rely on destructive
atomic energy to take care of itself.
Already there is the tempting but
dangerous notion to the effect that
the atomic bomb is so horrible and
the terror of retaliation so great
that we may have seen the last of
war.
This is quasi-logical, but war is
no respecter of logic, relative or
absolute. And if history teaches us
anything, it is that the possibility
of war increases in direct proportion
to the effectiveness of the instru
ments of war.
Far from banishing war, the
atomic bomb will in itself consti
tute a cause of war. In (he ab
sence of world control as part of
world government, it will create
universal fear and suspicion. Each
nation will live nervously from
one moment to the next, not
knowing whether the designs or
ambitions of other nations might
prompt them to attempt a light
ning blow of obliteration.
The ordinary, the inevitable dif
ferences among nations which might
in themselves be susceptible of so
lution might now become the sig
nals for direct action, lest the other
nation get in the first and decisive
blow.
Since the science of warfare will
no longer be dependent upon armies
but will be waged by push-buttons,
releasing radio - controlled rocket
planes carrying cargoes of atomic
explosives, the slightest suspicion
may start all the push-buttons go
ing.
REASON AN EASY VICTIM
There is the argument, of course,
that each nation will realize this;
that is, that the first button might
lead to universal catastrophe as all
the other nations rush to their
switchboards of annihilation. Here,
too, there is the unwarranted pre
supposition of reason. In an atmos
phere of high tension und suspi
cion, reason is an easy victim.
Moreover, there will always be the
feeling that one nation can escape
though all the others may go down.
What a temptation for the blitz
kriegers!
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ONLY
No; there is no comfort to be de
rived from the war-is-now-too-hor
rible theory. There is one way and
only one to achieve effective control
of destructive atomic energy and
that is through centralized world
government. Not loose, informal or
ganization. Not even through an in
ternational pool, or through an in
ternational policing agreement. A
police force is no better than its
laws, and there can be no law with
out government. Finally, the po
tency of the weapon must dictate
the potency of its control.
There is no need to discuss the
historical reasons pointing to and
arguing for world government.
There is no need to talk of the
dilliculties in the way of world
government. There is need only
to ask whether we can afford to
do without it. All other consider
ations become either secondary or
inconsequential.
It would be comforting to know
that the world had several genera
tions in which it might be able to
evolve naturally and progressively
into a single governmental unit. In
fact, even as late as August 5, 1945,
it seemed that the charter of the
United Nations had made an ade
quate beginning in that direction,
providing the machinery for revi
sion which might lead within 15 or
20 years to a real world structure.
ANOTHER CONFERENCE
But the time factor has been shat
tered. We no longer have a leeway
of 15 or 20 years; whatevpr must be
done must be done with an imme
diacy which is in keeping with the
urgency. Once the basic peace set
tlements are arranged, the United
Nations must convene again for an
atomic age inventory, undertaking
an overall examination of the revo
lutionary changes in the world since
its conference in San Francisco in
the long-ago spring of 1945.
If this all sounds like headlong
argument, posing methods or so
lutions which seem above the
reach of mortal man, the answer
must he that mortal man's reach
was long enough apparently to
push science and invention ahead
by at least five hundred years
during five years of experimenta
tion on atomic energy. His abil
ity to do this not only indicates
that he can extend or over-ex
tend himself when pressed, but
emphasizes the need to do the
same with government.
In meeting this need, man need
not be frightened by the enormity
| of (he differences which shall have
I(o be accommodated within the
world structure. We can agree with
| Macneile Dixon in "The Human
J Situation," that "Many are the races
and many the temperaments. There
i are vehement and hot-headed men,
! selfless and conciliatory men. They
! display, varying as they do in ap
! pearance, talents, behavior, every
| <vpe of unpredictable reaction to
1 their surroundings. There are syb
| arites and ascetics, dreamers and
bustling active men of affairs, clever
and stupid, worldly and religious,
| mockers and mystics, pugnacious,
j loyal, cunning, treacherous, cheer
ful and melancholy men. There are
I eagles among them, tigers, doves
; and serpents. 'He was a comedian
I on the stage,' said the wife of a cel
ebrated funny man, 'but a trage
dian in the home.'" All these dif
• ferences are in addition to those of
I ideology, politics, and geography.

RECONCILE DIFFERENCES
And yet, it is not in spite of these I
variations, but because-of them that
man is now in need of a general
amalgam. If those variations did not
exist, if man's actions were uniform,
and uniformly predictable, then man
would be as free of war as the vege- j
table kingdom. The differences point !
up the problem, not the problem the |
differences. The important question j
is not how great an obstacle the dif
ferences may be to the setting up [
of a closely knit world structure, t
but whether man will be in a better |
position to reconcile those differ- j
ences within world government than j
without it.
Man must decide, moreover, ,
what is more important—his dif- '
ferences or his similarities. If he i
chooses the former, he embarks
on a path that will, paradoxically,
destroy the differences and him
self as well. If he chooses the
latter, he shows a willingness to
meet the responsibilities that go
with maturity and conscience.
Though heterogeneity is the, basic
manifestation of nature, as Spen
cer observed, a still greater mani
festation is the ability of nature
to create larger areas of homo
geneity which act as a sort
of rim to the spokes of the human
wheel.
True, in making the jump to world
government, man is taking a big
chance. Not only does he have to
create the first world authority, but
he shall have to make sure that this
authority is wisely used. The world
institution must be compatible with
—indeed must promote—free insti
tutions. This challenge is not less
important than the challenge to es
tablish world government itself, for
all through history there has been
too great a contradiction between
ideals and institutions and the
forces which have taken over those
ideals and institutions.
IDEALS PERVERTED
Another way of saying this is that
we have too often allowed the best
ideas to fall into the hands of the
worst men. There has not been a
great ideal or idea which has not
been perverted or exploited at one
time or another by those who were
looking for means to an end—the
end being seldom compatible with
the idea itself. The greatest idea
ever to be taken up by the mind of
man—Christianity—was for centu
ries violated and corrupted by its
very administrators. Alexander's
vision of a brotherhood of man fell
victim to its own force—force based
on might makes right.
Mohammed dreamed of a uni
versal religion based on the no
blest of ethics, and taught that
conversion by the sword was no
conversion at all; yet his follow
ers built an empire largely at the
point of the sword. Passing from
religion to politics, we have only
to consider the immediate past.
It was in the name of socialism
and social progress that Fascism
came to Italy and Nazism to Ger
many.
That is the double nature of the
challenge: to bring about world gov
j ernment and to keep it pure. It is
I a large order, perhaps the largest
S order man has had to meet in his
50,000-odd years on earth, but he
| himself has set up the conditions
| which have made the order neces
sary.
MAN'S ALTERNATIVE
All these are the various muta
tions and adjustments needed in the
expression of man's nature, in his
I way of life, his thinking, his eco
j nomics, bis education, his condition
j ing and orientation, and his concept
j of government in an atomic age.
But if he rejects this, the first
| course, there is yet another way,
an alternative to world government.
This is the second course. Prepos
terous as this second course may
seem, we describe it in all serious
| ness, for it is possible that through
! it man may find a way to stay alive
| —which is the central problem un
[ der consideration in this paper.
The second course is relatively
simple. > It requires that man de
stroy, carefully and completely,
everything relating to science and
| civilization. Let him destroy all
} machines and the knowledge
which can build or operate those
; machines. Let him raze his cities,
smash his laboratories, dismantle
his factories, tear down his uni-
I vcrsities and schools, burn his li
braries, rip apart his art. Let him
murder his scientists, his doctors,
his teachers,. his lawmakers, his
I mechanics, his merchants, and
anyone who has anything to do
with the machinery of knowledge
or progress.
Let him punish literacy by death.

Let him abolish nations and set up*
the tribe as sovereign. In short, let '
him revert to his condition in so
ciety in 10,000 B.C. Thus emanci
pated from science, from progress,
from government, from knowledge,
from thought, he can be reasonably
certain of safe-guarding his exist
ence on this planet.
This is (he alternative to world 1
government — if modern man j
wishes an alternative.—N. C.
