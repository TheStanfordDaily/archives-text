# Kirkpatrick Urges Disclosure of Bomb
## 
### 
"The question of the disposal of
the atomic bomb just won't wait,"
was the judgment of Paul Kirk
patrick, acting dean of the school
of Physical Sciences, in an inter
view yesterday. "Our nation would
do well to disclose immediately the
knowledge it has gained in experi
ments on the atomic bomb project."
Disclosure of the secret would,
according to Mr. Kirkpatrick, allay
the fears of the nations who do not
yet hold it; it would serve to dis
solve the animosity and distrust of
nations, abroad, who look now at
the United States as not a friend,
but a potential enemy of the dead
liest sort.
Statesmen: Our Only Defense
"There is basically no secret to the
manufacture of the bomb," he said,
"and the only line of defense against
it is the intelligent judgement of
our statesmen."
Most physicists—ninety-five per
cent of the scientists at Los Ala
mos—are of the same mind. Posi
tive action must be taken immedi
ately toward the internationaliza
tion of the bomb. It will be neces
sary for the countries of the world
to trade in some measure of a na
tional sovereignty in the interests
of a central authority that will scare
off the use of the bomb for pur
poses of military conquest, he said.
Have We the lirains?
"I doubt if the human race has
the brains to deal with the poison
of the bomb. We can only hope so.
The men who developed the bomb
hoped all along the way that they
would bump into some scientific
principle that would prevent their
completing it."
The scientists of the New Mexico
project feel that they were, to a
measure, tricked by the United
States government—they entered in
to the work with the understanding
that some use of the bomb other
than wanton destruction of (he
enemy would be made. Mr. Kirk
patrick feels that the use of the
bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
was unnecessary. These cities and
their residents were not proper
military targets; we should have re
vealed our ownership of the power
with some demonstration less ruth
less in its effect, he said.
Truman Recommendation
' President Truman seems to
recommend the bottling up of scien
tific experimentation in all areas
surrounding atomic energy as a
method of preserving our safety,"
continued Mr. Kirkpatrick. This
would imply that any scientist who
wishes to conduct experiments to

find out more about the structure
of the atom would be breaking the
law.
Progress in science cannot be
achieved if restricted by such laws;
science requires open experimenta
tion and correspondence. This
recommendation of Mr. Truman's is
not the answer to control, accord
ing to Mr. Kirkpatrick.
Short-Lived Sccrccy
That the secret cannot long be
kept is a certainty, he continued.
Every other country has physicists
smart enough to discover the prin
ciples releasing atomic energy—
many of the scientists at Los Ala
mos were foreign-born.
We have definite proof that the
Japs and the Germans both were
working on the project. The Jap
anese came to false conclusions and
believing completion impossible,
turned their scientific efforts to other
developments. The Germans were
closer to the secret, and had their
work not been subject to bombard
ment, it is not hard to suppose that
they might have beaten us to it.
Physicists Demand Action
Physicists throughout the nation
arc trying to organize themselves
into a group whose voice will be
heard in the councils of the United
Nations—a voice that is shouting for
immediate international action. Per
haps more than any other group in
the nation, the physicists have
awakened to the social consequences
of their work.
Mr. Kirkpatrick said he was en
couraged by Congress's admission
of men educated in science to testi
fy before them in regard to legis
lation for the bomb. Right now a
Senate Special Committee on Atomic
Energy is being organized under
Brien McMahon of Connecticut, to
prepare legislation for its use. Sen
ator McMahon has telegraphed Mr.
Kirkpatrick to recommend a man
as scientific adviser to the commit
tee.
Atomic Energy: A Blessing
It is possible that good things may
come from the invention of the
bomb; this committee has been
formulated to discover them. It is
scientifically, though perhaps not
economically, feasible to direct the
principle of releasing energy toward
the generation of heat.
Possibly in 15 or 20 years, trans
ocean ships and similar large-scale
consumers will be run by atomic
energy. Scientists have only to find
the proper gadgets for domesticat
ing the energy.
No Defense
"I thoroughly disbelieve the state-
ment that the bomb could be set off
by radio beams at a distance," he
said, when asked about immediate
defense against its use. "Oppen
heimer told Congress that in a single
night you could spread enough
atomic bombs in this country to kill
40,000,000 persons. It is possible of
course, that the planes carrying the
bombs could be shot down before
reaching the targets, and I do not
believe that it is inevitable that the
bombs would go off."
The control of uranium would !
hardly be insurance against the de- j
velopment of the bomb by other j
countries. Uranium very probably
is present in many places where it
is not now known to exist, he said.
"The atomic bomb is the most im- j
portant thing the world* has to wor- |
ry about today," Mr. Kirkpatrick j
concluded. "It is more important in
its effect on the human race than
the war which it ended. It is es- j
sential for all those in power to
remember—in outlining methods of
control—we have just one chance." j

heard in the councils of the United

haps more than any other group in
the nation, the physicists have
awakened to the social consequences
of their work.
Mr. Kirkpatrick said he was en
couraged by Congress's admission
of men educated in science to testi
fy before them in regard to legis
lation for the bomb. Right now a
Senate Special Committee on Atomic
Energy is being organized under
Brien McMahon of Connecticut, to
prepare legislation for its use. Sen
ator McMahon has telegraphed Mr.
Kirkpatrick to recommend a man
as scientific adviser to the commit

Atomic Energy: A Blessing
It is possible that good things may
come from the invention of the
bomb; this committee has been
formulated to discover them. It is
scientifically, though perhaps not
economically, feasible to direct the
principle of releasing energy toward
the generation of heat.
Possibly in 15 or 20 years, trans
ocean ships and similar large-scale
consumers will be run by atomic
energy. Scientists have only to find
the proper gadgets for domesticat
ing the energy.
No Defense
"I thoroughly disbelieve the state-
ment that the bomb could be set off
by radio beams at a distance," he
said, when asked about immediate
defense against its use. "Oppen
heimer told Congress that in a single
night you could spread enough
atomic bombs in this country to kill
40,000,000 persons. It is possible of
course, that the planes carrying the
bombs could be shot down before
reaching the targets, and I do not
believe that it is inevitable that the
bombs would go off."
The control of uranium would !
hardly be insurance against the de- j
velopment of the bomb by other j
countries. Uranium very probably
is present in many places where it
is not now known to exist, he said.
"The atomic bomb is the most im- j
portant thing the world* has to wor- |
ry about today," Mr. Kirkpatrick j
concluded. "It is more important in
its effect on the human race than
the war which it ended. It is es- j
sential for all those in power to
remember—in outlining methods of
control—we have just one chance." j

"The question of the disposal of
the atomic bomb just won't wait,"
was the judgment of Paul Kirk
patrick, acting dean of the school
of Physical Sciences, in an inter
view yesterday. "Our nation would
do well to disclose immediately the
knowledge it has gained in experi
ments on the atomic bomb project."
Disclosure of the secret would,
according to Mr. Kirkpatrick, allay
the fears of the nations who do not
yet hold it; it would serve to dis
solve the animosity and distrust of
nations, abroad, who look now at
the United States as not a friend,
but a potential enemy of the dead
liest sort.
Statesmen: Our Only Defense
"There is basically no secret to the
manufacture of the bomb," he said,
"and the only line of defense against
it is the intelligent judgement of
our statesmen."
Most physicists—ninety-five per
cent of the scientists at Los Ala
mos—are of the same mind. Posi
tive action must be taken immedi
ately toward the internationaliza
tion of the bomb. It will be neces
sary for the countries of the world
to trade in some measure of a na
tional sovereignty in the interests
of a central authority that will scare
off the use of the bomb for pur
poses of military conquest, he said.
Have We the lirains?
"I doubt if the human race has
the brains to deal with the poison
of the bomb. We can only hope so.
The men who developed the bomb
hoped all along the way that they
would bump into some scientific
principle that would prevent their
completing it."
The scientists of the New Mexico
project feel that they were, to a
measure, tricked by the United
States government—they entered in
to the work with the understanding
that some use of the bomb other
than wanton destruction of (he
enemy would be made. Mr. Kirk
patrick feels that the use of the
bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
was unnecessary. These cities and
their residents were not proper
military targets; we should have re
vealed our ownership of the power
with some demonstration less ruth
less in its effect, he said.
Truman Recommendation
' President Truman seems to
recommend the bottling up of scien
tific experimentation in all areas
surrounding atomic energy as a
method of preserving our safety,"
continued Mr. Kirkpatrick. This
would imply that any scientist who
wishes to conduct experiments to

find out more about the structure
of the atom would be breaking the
law.
Progress in science cannot be
achieved if restricted by such laws;
science requires open experimenta
tion and correspondence. This
recommendation of Mr. Truman's is
not the answer to control, accord
ing to Mr. Kirkpatrick.
Short-Lived Sccrccy
That the secret cannot long be
kept is a certainty, he continued.
Every other country has physicists
smart enough to discover the prin
ciples releasing atomic energy—
many of the scientists at Los Ala
mos were foreign-born.
We have definite proof that the
Japs and the Germans both were
working on the project. The Jap
anese came to false conclusions and
believing completion impossible,
turned their scientific efforts to other
developments. The Germans were
closer to the secret, and had their
work not been subject to bombard
ment, it is not hard to suppose that
they might have beaten us to it.

tional sovereignty in the interests
of a central authority that will scare
off the use of the bomb for pur
poses of military conquest, he said.
Have We the lirains?
"I doubt if the human race has
the brains to deal with the poison
of the bomb. We can only hope so.
The men who developed the bomb
hoped all along the way that they
would bump into some scientific
principle that would prevent their
completing it."
The scientists of the New Mexico
project feel that they were, to a
measure, tricked by the United
States government—they entered in
to the work with the understanding
that some use of the bomb other
than wanton destruction of (he
enemy would be made. Mr. Kirk
patrick feels that the use of the
bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
was unnecessary. These cities and
their residents were not proper
military targets; we should have re
vealed our ownership of the power
with some demonstration less ruth
less in its effect, he said.
Truman Recommendation
' President Truman seems to
recommend the bottling up of scien
tific experimentation in all areas
surrounding atomic energy as a
method of preserving our safety,"
continued Mr. Kirkpatrick. This
would imply that any scientist who
wishes to conduct experiments to

find out more about the structure
of the atom would be breaking the
law.
Progress in science cannot be
achieved if restricted by such laws;
science requires open experimenta
tion and correspondence. This
recommendation of Mr. Truman's is
not the answer to control, accord
ing to Mr. Kirkpatrick.
Short-Lived Sccrccy
That the secret cannot long be
kept is a certainty, he continued.
Every other country has physicists
smart enough to discover the prin
ciples releasing atomic energy—
many of the scientists at Los Ala
mos were foreign-born.
We have definite proof that the
Japs and the Germans both were
working on the project. The Jap
anese came to false conclusions and
believing completion impossible,
turned their scientific efforts to other
developments. The Germans were
closer to the secret, and had their
work not been subject to bombard
ment, it is not hard to suppose that
they might have beaten us to it.
Physicists Demand Action
Physicists throughout the nation
arc trying to organize themselves
into a group whose voice will be
heard in the councils of the United
Nations—a voice that is shouting for
immediate international action. Per
haps more than any other group in
the nation, the physicists have
awakened to the social consequences
of their work.
Mr. Kirkpatrick said he was en
couraged by Congress's admission
of men educated in science to testi
fy before them in regard to legis
lation for the bomb. Right now a
Senate Special Committee on Atomic
Energy is being organized under
Brien McMahon of Connecticut, to
prepare legislation for its use. Sen
ator McMahon has telegraphed Mr.
Kirkpatrick to recommend a man
as scientific adviser to the commit
tee.
Atomic Energy: A Blessing
It is possible that good things may
come from the invention of the
bomb; this committee has been
formulated to discover them. It is
scientifically, though perhaps not
economically, feasible to direct the
principle of releasing energy toward
the generation of heat.
Possibly in 15 or 20 years, trans
ocean ships and similar large-scale
consumers will be run by atomic
energy. Scientists have only to find
the proper gadgets for domesticat
ing the energy.
No Defense
"I thoroughly disbelieve the state-
ment that the bomb could be set off
by radio beams at a distance," he
said, when asked about immediate
defense against its use. "Oppen
heimer told Congress that in a single
night you could spread enough
atomic bombs in this country to kill
40,000,000 persons. It is possible of
course, that the planes carrying the
bombs could be shot down before
reaching the targets, and I do not
believe that it is inevitable that the
bombs would go off."
The control of uranium would !
hardly be insurance against the de- j
velopment of the bomb by other j
countries. Uranium very probably
is present in many places where it
is not now known to exist, he said.
"The atomic bomb is the most im- j
portant thing the world* has to wor- |
ry about today," Mr. Kirkpatrick j
concluded. "It is more important in
its effect on the human race than
the war which it ended. It is es- j
sential for all those in power to
remember—in outlining methods of
control—we have just one chance." j

"The question of the disposal of
the atomic bomb just won't wait,"
was the judgment of Paul Kirk
patrick, acting dean of the school
of Physical Sciences, in an inter
view yesterday. "Our nation would
do well to disclose immediately the
knowledge it has gained in experi
ments on the atomic bomb project."
Disclosure of the secret would,
according to Mr. Kirkpatrick, allay
the fears of the nations who do not
yet hold it; it would serve to dis
solve the animosity and distrust of
nations, abroad, who look now at
the United States as not a friend,
but a potential enemy of the dead
liest sort.
Statesmen: Our Only Defense
"There is basically no secret to the
manufacture of the bomb," he said,
"and the only line of defense against
it is the intelligent judgement of
our statesmen."
Most physicists—ninety-five per
cent of the scientists at Los Ala
mos—are of the same mind. Posi
tive action must be taken immedi
ately toward the internationaliza
tion of the bomb. It will be neces
sary for the countries of the world
to trade in some measure of a na
tional sovereignty in the interests
of a central authority that will scare
off the use of the bomb for pur
poses of military conquest, he said.
