# Wilbur States Atomic Secret Can't Be Kept
## 
### 
"The knowledge of the atomic
bomb and nuclear energy," said Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, chancellor and
former president of Stanford Uni
versity, "is or soon will be uni
versal property. It concerns a law
of nature available to all.
"It is impossible to control such
knowledge by keeping it secret."
Can't Control Nature
When a country enters the domain
of nature with politics, Dr. Wilbur
contended, politics will do what it
can but it cannot control nature as
a private discovery, any more than
those legislators who tried to tell a
cow what symptoms she must have
with tuberculosis could control that.
It was impossible to get it over
either to the cow or the tubercle
bacillus.
"Anybody properly trained can
discover the facts of the atomic
bomb," he continued, "by getting
together what is known of nuclear
physics and by further experiment
ing, break the atom. Our scient
ists should publish the facts of
breaking the atom as we should
publish the discovery of any other
scientific truth. Adaptations of dis
covered facts have been kept secret
to use them as weapons of war for
many years, which, of course, is
wrong."
One Reason for Secrecy
"The only reason we would have
to keep the bomb a secret," thought
Dr. Wilbur, "would be to force oth
er countries to do what we wish
and to try to have power with the
new weapon, yet how do we know
that they haven't already discov
ered the same nuclear physics we

have? I think the whole matter |
hinges on a different aspect.
"We went through the whole pro
j gram of developing the United Na
tions and now we follow it with
this. What we should do is to en
hance the decisions of San Fran
' cisco, to make San Francisco im- !
portant then the peace will succeed.
"If we outlawed the atomic bomb

as 'poison,' as wc have labeled oth
er discoveries such as some poison
gases, we could turn the use of
atomic energy to the good of the
human race, rather than to the de
struction of it."
We can't suddenly jump into a
world government with a world
president, however. Dr. Wilbur be
lieved, since nobody wants to turn
over everything to such a govern
ment. That would result only in
trouble and that isn't the way for
the human race to profit most.
Appoint Committee
Wc can appoint a committee to
decide our use of the atomic bomb
as a war policy, but we cannot con
trol what others may do. He ques
tioned what good is old-fashioned
military training—men in uniforms
—with the present knowledge. Their
training is apt to be obsolete, as
they are preparing for something
that never before was known in the
worid.
"Even the United States, which we
call the most civilized nation," he
said, "wiped out two cities in a few
minutes proving that if the civilian
population, men, women, and chil
dren, are in the way they may be
liquidated with no protection on
their part.
Problem Compared
"The problem of how the atomic
secret should be controlled and by
whom may be compared to the situ
ation of the world mail service, the
Red Cross, or public health. Even
during the worst months of the war
both the mail and the Red Cross
got through to almost every person
