# Answer to Atomic Power Is Moral Power—Trueblood
## 
### 
"The only ultimate answer to
atomic power is moral power," de
clared D. Elton Trueblood, Uni
versity chaplain, in a recent inter
view. When asked about a possible
defense against the atomic bomb,
Dr. Trueblood stated that such a de
fense was not merely a scientific
question, because, he said, "there is
no adequate scientific defense
against it."
"It is therefore a political ques
tion," he continued, "and must be
handled by governments in some
kind of a pact." But this pact de
pends on trustworthy nations, he
said, bringing forth the need for a
moral defense to the atom bomb.
Moral Awakening
"There must be a great moral
awakening among the enlightened
people of the world who might try
to save us," he said.
"I am tremendously concerned
with the problem which the atom
bomb presents," he declared, "it
clearly represents the end of our
time. On August 6, 1945, the whole
world became different."
Dr. Trueblood warned against a

general feeling of awareness of the
danger which the atom bomb's ex
istence presents. "There has been a
great deal of naive talk concern
ing the atomic bomb," he said. "But
the greatest naivete is the idea that
this will make war impossible be
cause it will be so horrible."
Won't Prevent War
No invention has ever stopped
war, or will, he added, saying that
so far no military invention has
ever been kept secret over a long
period of iime.
"Wc must not just give the secret
of the atomic bomb away," he de
dared; "instead we must try to bring
to bear the moral power of the en
lightened people of the world—for
the sake of the world."
Dr. Trueblood said he believed
that by keeping the atom bomb a
secret, the United States would only
consolidate world opinion against
itself.

"However," he said, "it would be
almost as bad to give it away want
only." Most of the powerful nations
arc on the track of the secret now,
he said, and the result of giving the
bomb secret away would probably
lcati to an armament race.
One World or None
"The only answer to the problem
is this," he declared, "there must
be one - world or none." This one
world, he said, must be brought
through the United Nations with
"moral enthusiasm." "Unless we do

it now, with ;i sense of urgency, we
won't do it at all," he added.
Dr. Trueblood emphasized what ho
thought was the chief revelation in
the development of the atomic bomb
—that the brains, money, and effort
of man can combine in close co
operation to bring forth the "great
est technical production of all time
in only four years."
