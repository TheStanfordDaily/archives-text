# Buck Says U.S. Can Use Bomb for Peace
## 
### 
The United States has a few years,
seven at the most, in which it can
utilize the atomic bomb to bring
about a strong world organization
which can prevent the recurrence of
war, stated Philip W, Buck, profes
sor of political science, when asked
about possible methods of atomic
bomb control.
"Scientists assure us that the se
cret of the atom bomb cannot be
kept," Mr. Buck said; "the whole
basis of it is common knowledge
throughout the world, and we only
possess the secret of the industrial
techniques of making it." Mr. Buck
ascertained that the United States
might, be able to keep this a secret
for from two to seven years.
International Government
"The most, intelligent thing for us
to do would be to try to work out a
system of International govern
ment," he added, "not international
control." He said that we aren't
yet ready to go as far as world gov
ernment; such a development might
take from 10 to 20 years.
"But we could develop the United
Nations charter into a real world
authority," he emphasized, "and we
have these few years, while we hold
the secret of the atom bomb, in
which to do it."
Bargain for Peace
Mr. Buck said he thought the
United States should approach the
rest of the world with a proposition
by which this country would say:
"We are willing to co-operate as
actively as possible, if you will too,
to organize a sufficiently powerful
United Nations organization to
which we can entrust this weapon."
"We must use these few years as
skillfully as we can," Mr. Buck de
clared, "and use the secret fif the
atomic bomb as a sort of bargain
ing advantage by which wc can and
must push the organization of a
strong United Nations structure."
Russia Not Diflinill
When asked how Russia might re
ad to such a plan. Mr. Buck said,
"Russia will not be / difficult. The
average American has a false notion
that the Russian community is run
entirely by Stalin.
"This is not true of any nation.
Any party dictatorship can stay in
authority only if the people say to
themselves, 'This isn't bad.' The

people of Russia have accepted, and
consent to, their government."
Americans have a tendency to
forget that. Russia took a terrible
beating in this war, Mr. Buck added.
"If we show the Russians anything
that looks reasonably safe, then
they'll work with us," he said.
Afraid to Trust U.S.
Mr. Buck emphasized the fact that
just as we arc afraid to trust Rus
sia, so the Russians arc afraid to
trust us. Our leaders can negotiate
with Russian leaders and find a
means of making a deal, he declared.
"If wc develop a charter with the
kind of scheme that brings co-op
eration," Mr. Buck stated, "then our
bargaining advantage (the atomic
bomb) must be very skillfully used."
Need Public Backing
"The general public must insist
on real assurance, and must be will
ing to back our offer," he said.
On the question of Communism,
Mr. Buck declared that Russia is
not desirous of spreading Commu
nism. "When Russia dissolved the
Comintern (the international or
