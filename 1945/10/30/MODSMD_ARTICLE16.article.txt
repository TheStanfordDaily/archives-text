## Anshen Previews Postwar House 
### 
Bccausc of the pressure against
change from many sides, the type
of house that has been prophesied
for the post-war world will prob
ably be impossible to obtain ex
cept in very expensive houses for
a' long time to come," said Robert
Anshen in his lecture on "The
Postwar House and Its Material"
at Cubberley Hall last night.
"To provide the greatest conven
ience, comfort, and beauty in a
home, the different parts must be
integrated. The home of the future
should be flexible, so that it can
be changed as the requirements of
the family change. It would mean
that machines were made for men,
and not vice versa.
"The traditional period house is
a symbol of the past; much of the
so-called modern of the present
day is a symbol of machine, but
a good house can be a symbol of
the scientific possibilities of the
future."
"Prefabrication is the answer to
many of the problems of house
construction, but just as the first
automobiles were expensive, so
the first of the prefabricated
homes will be high-priced," added
Mr. Anshen.
Mr. Anshen is a member of the
San Francisco architectural firm
Anshen and Allen, and has been
technical consultant to the Vallejo
Housing Authority.
The speech was illustrated by
colored slides of American archi
tectural structures. Pictures of
the best and worst in American
homes were shown. After the
lecture Mr. Anshen answered
questions asked by the audience.
Following (he program, the Art
Gallery exhibit of contemporary ar
chitecture was opened for a pre
view.
Mr. Anshen was introduced by
Kdward Farmer of the Graphic
Art Department.
