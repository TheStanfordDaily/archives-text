To The Editor:
In a recent editorial "Military Training—A
Must," a plea was made for peace-time military
training in the United States as a means of form
ing a base for world security. It was stated that
the "essential issue is whether or not universal
military training will serve to keep the peace in
a united world."
Military training means preparation for
v/ur. In the past, preparation for war has NOT
meant peace. Uncle Sam is one of the "peace
loving" nations; but what if other nations see
his huge peace-time army as a threat to their
secui ity?
The security of conscription is an illusion.
A policy that prepares for war will get war. We
need only remember Europe—the armed camp
between the last two wars and the results of
the race for arms.
Stated simply again, the issue can be, "Do
we want to fight another war?" No, we don't.
Thejefore we can't afford to support such a pol
icy that would only lead to suicide.
V/ould conscription insure us against the
suspicion of other nations and their desire
to meet us arm for arm? A security built
upon superior strength v/ould become a myth
as other nations grew stronger. Russia alone
has a population 40 per cent greater than
ours. Asia and the Far East has a manpower
potential enabling them eventually to out
conscript us more than 8 to 1!
11 would be inevitable that our neighbors
v/ould ask, "Against whom is the United States
arming?" We ourselves might stop to analyze
the guestion, "Against whom are we prepar
ing?" Surely not against a totally defeated
Germany and Japan. Surely not against Great
Britain, whose interests and ideas are too close
ly allied to ours.
Do we think that we can fool Joe Stalin by
extending the hand of friendship and at the
same time hold the gun behind our back?
We have to make the choice now. It must
certainly be clear that separate nations each
with their national army, cannot maintain
the peace. It must be clear that nations op
posing each other with force are not united
but divided- -one against the other. Under
such terms, a plea for "peace in a united
world" is made in vain!
Therefore, as was stated, "It becomes clear
that we can only escape catastrophe in the fu
ture by putting our faith in a strong and sover
eign world organization." Let us not destroy
that faith by making the wrong choice now. Let
us build it. Let us work for a strong and sov
ereign world organization which alone has the
power to maintain peace.
Such an organization is only sovereign and
strong when it is given that power to be so—
through a WORLD police force, not through
any single nation's ARMY, no, not the United
States' nor Russia's nor any other nation's.
We know that within our own nation it is
a supreme, federated government backed by
a police force which keeps the peace and
order of the nation. In a federation of na
tions the same should apply — a WORLD
police force devoted to world order. "A
strength and reserve force from the United
States" could not be sufficient to do that job.

Let us not just put all the eggs into the bas
ket. Rather let us break open the shell oi
nationalism and make a real omelette — A
WORKABLE WORLD ORGANIZATION. —

that faith by making the wrong choice now. Let
us build it. Let us work for a strong and sov

power to maintain peace.
Such an organization is only sovereign and
strong when it is given that power to be so—
through a WORLD police force, not through
any single nation's ARMY, no, not the United
States' nor Russia's nor any other nation's.
We know that within our own nation it is
a supreme, federated government backed by
a police force which keeps the peace and

To The Editor:
In a recent editorial "Military Training—A
Must," a plea was made for peace-time military
training in the United States as a means of form
ing a base for world security. It was stated that
the "essential issue is whether or not universal
military training will serve to keep the peace in
a united world."
Military training means preparation for
v/ur. In the past, preparation for war has NOT
meant peace. Uncle Sam is one of the "peace
loving" nations; but what if other nations see
his huge peace-time army as a threat to their
secui ity?
The security of conscription is an illusion.
A policy that prepares for war will get war. We
need only remember Europe—the armed camp
between the last two wars and the results of
the race for arms.
Stated simply again, the issue can be, "Do
we want to fight another war?" No, we don't.
Thejefore we can't afford to support such a pol
icy that would only lead to suicide.
V/ould conscription insure us against the
suspicion of other nations and their desire
to meet us arm for arm? A security built
upon superior strength v/ould become a myth
as other nations grew stronger. Russia alone
has a population 40 per cent greater than
ours. Asia and the Far East has a manpower
potential enabling them eventually to out
conscript us more than 8 to 1!
11 would be inevitable that our neighbors
v/ould ask, "Against whom is the United States
arming?" We ourselves might stop to analyze
the guestion, "Against whom are we prepar
ing?" Surely not against a totally defeated
Germany and Japan. Surely not against Great
Britain, whose interests and ideas are too close
ly allied to ours.
Do we think that we can fool Joe Stalin by
extending the hand of friendship and at the
same time hold the gun behind our back?
We have to make the choice now. It must
certainly be clear that separate nations each
with their national army, cannot maintain
the peace. It must be clear that nations op
posing each other with force are not united
but divided- -one against the other. Under
such terms, a plea for "peace in a united
world" is made in vain!

upon superior strength v/ould become a myth
as other nations grew stronger. Russia alone
has a population 40 per cent greater than
ours. Asia and the Far East has a manpower
potential enabling them eventually to out
conscript us more than 8 to 1!
11 would be inevitable that our neighbors
v/ould ask, "Against whom is the United States
arming?" We ourselves might stop to analyze
the guestion, "Against whom are we prepar
ing?" Surely not against a totally defeated
Germany and Japan. Surely not against Great
Britain, whose interests and ideas are too close
ly allied to ours.
Do we think that we can fool Joe Stalin by
extending the hand of friendship and at the
same time hold the gun behind our back?
We have to make the choice now. It must
certainly be clear that separate nations each
with their national army, cannot maintain
the peace. It must be clear that nations op
posing each other with force are not united
but divided- -one against the other. Under
such terms, a plea for "peace in a united
world" is made in vain!
Therefore, as was stated, "It becomes clear
that we can only escape catastrophe in the fu
ture by putting our faith in a strong and sover
eign world organization." Let us not destroy
that faith by making the wrong choice now. Let
us build it. Let us work for a strong and sov
ereign world organization which alone has the
power to maintain peace.
Such an organization is only sovereign and
strong when it is given that power to be so—
through a WORLD police force, not through
any single nation's ARMY, no, not the United
States' nor Russia's nor any other nation's.
We know that within our own nation it is
a supreme, federated government backed by
a police force which keeps the peace and
order of the nation. In a federation of na
tions the same should apply — a WORLD
police force devoted to world order. "A
strength and reserve force from the United
States" could not be sufficient to do that job.

Let us not just put all the eggs into the bas
ket. Rather let us break open the shell oi
nationalism and make a real omelette — A
WORKABLE WORLD ORGANIZATION. —
M.V.P.
