# RAM'S HEAD REPORT
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Ram's Head has always been a student-run organi
zation, continually determined to accept, and thor
oughly capable of accepting, full responsibility for its
activities. Certainly Ram's Head, as much as any
other student-controlled organization on campus, rec
ognizes, and intends to fight to uphold, Stanford's
"remarkable record of independence in student gov
ernment and student activities."
Rani's Head was led to believe that in "accept
ing" the suggestion for a student review board made
by Excom (but precipitated from a single adminis
trative source rather than from student discussion),
it .was taking the only available method of avoiding
future administrative control of its activities; for
Ram's Head was strongly advised by Excom that
if a board of students was not set up for the pur
pose of "censoring" student productions, faculty and
administrative intervention would result.
It was, then, in an effort to keep student produc
tions under student control, and not to "pass the buck"
by shifting responsibility for the "good taste" of its
productions to another group, that Ram's Head ac
quiesced to the suggestion of a student review com
mittee. Ram's Head is proud of its activities as an
honorary dramatic society; and it feels itself entirely
capable of producing and "censoring" its own pro
grams.
Since the last meeting of Excom, it has come to
the attention of Ham's Head that the administration's
feeling for the need of a student review board was
the outcome of a number of "complaints" made to
the administration and vaguely defined by the ad
ministration as questioning the propriety of past
Ram's Head productions. Ram's Head does not feel
that such "complaints" (apparently made to the ad
ministration, but never brought directly to Ram's
Head) are basis enough for the proposed adminis
trative intervention; consequently, there seems to
be no immediate need for a student review board
for protection against administrative control.
Secondly, Ram's Head would like to propose that
until the administration can come directly to this or
ganization and present to it their reasons for believing
that a censorship committee made up of non-Ram's
Head as well as Ram's Head members is essential to
its welfare, the student censorship board voted upon
in Excom last Wednesday should be abolished.
In the future, Ram's Head believes that the prob
lem of a need for censorship of any sort of student
productions can be alleviated if the administration
will bring all complaints, criticisms, and suggestions
concerning Ram's Head productions directly to this
organization. We believe that Gaieties of 1945 will
serve as an example of the ability of Ram's Head to
produce and censor its own productions.

(Assistant Director of 1945 Gaieties)
To the Editor:
Ram's Head has always been a student-run organi
zation, continually determined to accept, and thor
oughly capable of accepting, full responsibility for its
activities. Certainly Ram's Head, as much as any
other student-controlled organization on campus, rec
ognizes, and intends to fight to uphold, Stanford's
"remarkable record of independence in student gov
ernment and student activities."
Rani's Head was led to believe that in "accept
ing" the suggestion for a student review board made
by Excom (but precipitated from a single adminis
trative source rather than from student discussion),
it .was taking the only available method of avoiding
future administrative control of its activities; for
Ram's Head was strongly advised by Excom that
if a board of students was not set up for the pur
pose of "censoring" student productions, faculty and
administrative intervention would result.
It was, then, in an effort to keep student produc
tions under student control, and not to "pass the buck"
by shifting responsibility for the "good taste" of its
productions to another group, that Ram's Head ac
quiesced to the suggestion of a student review com
mittee. Ram's Head is proud of its activities as an
honorary dramatic society; and it feels itself entirely
capable of producing and "censoring" its own pro
grams.
Since the last meeting of Excom, it has come to
the attention of Ham's Head that the administration's
feeling for the need of a student review board was
the outcome of a number of "complaints" made to
the administration and vaguely defined by the ad
ministration as questioning the propriety of past
Ram's Head productions. Ram's Head does not feel
that such "complaints" (apparently made to the ad
ministration, but never brought directly to Ram's
Head) are basis enough for the proposed adminis
trative intervention; consequently, there seems to
be no immediate need for a student review board
for protection against administrative control.
Secondly, Ram's Head would like to propose that
until the administration can come directly to this or
ganization and present to it their reasons for believing
that a censorship committee made up of non-Ram's
Head as well as Ram's Head members is essential to
its welfare, the student censorship board voted upon
in Excom last Wednesday should be abolished.
In the future, Ram's Head believes that the prob
lem of a need for censorship of any sort of student
productions can be alleviated if the administration
will bring all complaints, criticisms, and suggestions
concerning Ram's Head productions directly to this
organization. We believe that Gaieties of 1945 will
serve as an example of the ability of Ram's Head to
produce and censor its own productions.
