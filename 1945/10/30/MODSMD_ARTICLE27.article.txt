### Stanley Wilson 
From my intelligence department: The ma
jority of the sales girls in a large swanky de
partment store in San Francisco are graduates
of Stanford University. Yes, sir, a college edu
cation will do no one any harm. And at that
I think the girls had to graduate with distinction
in order to begin work. Now they're probably
taking extension courses from the University
of California in view of future promotions.

Note to the San Francisco Examiner: The
President of Chile did not visit Robert Tresid
der of Stanford last Sunday. He visited Don
ald! You might have confused Donald Tresid
der with Robert Sproul of your beloved U. of C.
in your Monday's story, page five, column five.
Please correct.

Congrats to the Lagunita-Union women for
a well-run dance Saturday night. Many couples
were turned away, and it has been established
by fact that there were no formals to be seen
in the local pubs after 10 o'clock Saturday
night. There's your measure of success.

Speaking of dances, we have confidential
information concerning the Cardinals' Red and
White Ball come December. Of course this de
partment is sworn to secrecy, but you can look
for a red hot affair, with a name band worth
anybody's money. We've lived through a long
period of juke boxes and second-rate bands,
but Cardinals is scheduled to break the ice
and bring our social life back to the pre-war
standard.

For any of you who have passed by the
Cellar lately, you probably will be as relieved
as I was when you found that Szigeti, eminent
violinist, "stands without a beer." How do
you do it, Joe?

We are very much interested in two signs
we saw last Friday. One was on the bulletin
board at the Cellar and the other on the post
office door. They read: "The Cal 'C' is now
painted red." Very interesting if true. How
about an anonymous explanation?

Some girls at Stanford just have a way about
them, I guess. Last week we saw a sign in the
window of the small living groups facing the
Row, which said: "Man wanted. See manager."
The interesting part is that a day later the sign
was down. As the old adage says,"It pays
to advertise."

For any of you who have passed by the
Cellar lately, you probably will be as relieved
as I was when you found that Szigeti, eminent
violinist, "stands without a beer." How do
you do it, Joe?

We are very much interested in two signs
we saw last Friday. One was on the bulletin
board at the Cellar and the other on the post
office door. They read: "The Cal 'C' is now
painted red." Very interesting if true. How
about an anonymous explanation?

Some girls at Stanford just have a way about
them, I guess. Last week we saw a sign in the
window of the small living groups facing the
Row, which said: "Man wanted. See manager."
The interesting part is that a day later the sign
was down. As the old adage says,"It pays
to advertise."
From my intelligence department: The ma
jority of the sales girls in a large swanky de
partment store in San Francisco are graduates
of Stanford University. Yes, sir, a college edu
cation will do no one any harm. And at that
I think the girls had to graduate with distinction
in order to begin work. Now they're probably
taking extension courses from the University
of California in view of future promotions.

Note to the San Francisco Examiner: The
President of Chile did not visit Robert Tresid
der of Stanford last Sunday. He visited Don
ald! You might have confused Donald Tresid
der with Robert Sproul of your beloved U. of C.
in your Monday's story, page five, column five.
Please correct.

Congrats to the Lagunita-Union women for
a well-run dance Saturday night. Many couples
were turned away, and it has been established
by fact that there were no formals to be seen
in the local pubs after 10 o'clock Saturday
night. There's your measure of success.

Speaking of dances, we have confidential
information concerning the Cardinals' Red and
White Ball come December. Of course this de
partment is sworn to secrecy, but you can look
for a red hot affair, with a name band worth
anybody's money. We've lived through a long
period of juke boxes and second-rate bands,
but Cardinals is scheduled to break the ice
and bring our social life back to the pre-war
standard.
