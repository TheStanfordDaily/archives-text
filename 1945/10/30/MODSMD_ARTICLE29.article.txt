ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 29 (UP).â€”
Admiral William F. Halsey, com
mander of the Third Fleet, predicted
tonight thai the next war probably
will not last six months and that
there will be "practically nothing
left of the loser."
Halsey, speaking at a combined
Navy Day and Victory War Loan
rally, said that the fighting men had
fought themselves out of a job.
Describing his adddress as "in the
nature of a valedictory," the ad
miral said that when the term "du
ration and six months" is applied to
future struggles, the six months are
likely to be considerably longer than
the duration.
Urging preparedness, Halsey said

that the United States never has
entered a war for which it has been
prepared.
"The action we take in the next
] two years will determine whether
I or not we are to win or lose that
[ futue terrible war, if war should
I come," he asserted.
"More important, I am willing to
predict that the course we decide
upon in the next two dangerous
years might largely determine whe
ther there is to be another war in
the foreseeable future."
He said an adequate preparedness
program would require a determi
nation that "our advancement in the
field of scientific research must not
be matched by any in the world."
