CHINA TROUBLE SPOT
Despite all the efforts at negoti
ation, China is again becoming a
trouble spot. Communist forces are
dug in along the main railways and
in Manchuria, and officers command
ing central government forces are
trying to throw them out.
The events in China do not form
a picture, but a panorama of every
thing from isolated skirmishes to
pitched battles. In that sense, it is
like the beginning of the Russian
civil war. However, each event
might be considered as a separate
incident, and a lot of them might
be the product of the horrible com
munications in modern China.
BATTLES
A unit commander of Chinese
regulars is ordered to take over
a key point in formerly Japanese
occupied territory. He assembles his
troops and marches them there. He
finds Chinese Communists dug in
with similar orders, and heated ne
gotiation starts. Since neither com
mander is a free agent, neither
gives an inch, so the only appeal
left open is to arms. The Com
munists dig a trench and the Kuom
ingtans form to force it. Meanwhile,
other Communists are raiding the
communications of the attacking
force, thus giving situations for
more skirmishes.
There might be variations of this
theme. Some semi-autonomous
warlord might take it into his mind
to start a civil war whether Chiang
Kai Shek likes it or not, and some
Communist leader might see his
duty as fighting until a definite un
derstanding is reached in the Chung
king parleys.
CRISIS
Yet there is one thing exasperating
about the picture. That is that
neither side in the negotiations is
giving an inch in this question.
This is sure to lead to gen
eral civil war, and it is necessary,
in judging future events, to try to
find ihe motives of each side.
It would seem that Chiang Kai
Shek is in the right. If he wasn't,
lie would have committed mechan -
ized reserves and paratroopers
along time ago. Also, he has the
least interest in starting trouble.

Russia would have an excuse for
intervention, and America would be
split about supporting Chiang, be
cause too many of us are trying to
ascribe idealologies to this Far-
Eastern game of internal power
politics.
COMMUNISTS
But now comes the question, are
the Communists in the wrong?
Their strategy seems to be to take
over the -key northern areas of the
country and hold them strongly, so
they control the nation's economy,
and have a strong club over Chiang's
head.
The reason for this might come
from two sources. First of all, Sta
lin's reasons for signing a pact with
China might have been very ulter
ior. He might have realized that a
war with China would have brought
the United States on his neck, and
it would also have tied down troops
that would be necessary in imple
menting a strong foreign policy in
the west. Thus he may have tried
to neutralize China by treaty, and
be sure, by properly posting the
Communists, that that nation would
never be a threat to his rear.
If this is the case, then our policy
should be definitely in favor of aid
to Chiang, because this is necessary
not only to our own interests, but
to those of world peace.
On the other hand, the Chinese
Communists might not trust Chiang,
and they might have concocted this
scheme for their own safety. In
that case, our position should be that
of trusted mediator for both sides.
Unfortunately, though, we cannot
tell which policy is right until we
have further developments to
judge.

On the other hand, the Chinese
Communists might not trust Chiang,
and they might have concocted this
scheme for their own safety. In

of trusted mediator for both sides.
Unfortunately, though, we cannot

have further developments to

CHINA TROUBLE SPOT
Despite all the efforts at negoti
ation, China is again becoming a
trouble spot. Communist forces are
dug in along the main railways and
in Manchuria, and officers command
ing central government forces are
trying to throw them out.
The events in China do not form
a picture, but a panorama of every
thing from isolated skirmishes to
pitched battles. In that sense, it is
like the beginning of the Russian
civil war. However, each event
might be considered as a separate
incident, and a lot of them might
be the product of the horrible com
munications in modern China.
BATTLES
A unit commander of Chinese
regulars is ordered to take over
a key point in formerly Japanese
occupied territory. He assembles his
troops and marches them there. He
finds Chinese Communists dug in
with similar orders, and heated ne
gotiation starts. Since neither com
mander is a free agent, neither
gives an inch, so the only appeal
left open is to arms. The Com
munists dig a trench and the Kuom
ingtans form to force it. Meanwhile,
other Communists are raiding the
communications of the attacking
force, thus giving situations for
more skirmishes.
There might be variations of this
theme. Some semi-autonomous
warlord might take it into his mind
to start a civil war whether Chiang
Kai Shek likes it or not, and some
Communist leader might see his
duty as fighting until a definite un
derstanding is reached in the Chung
king parleys.
CRISIS
Yet there is one thing exasperating
about the picture. That is that
neither side in the negotiations is
giving an inch in this question.
This is sure to lead to gen
eral civil war, and it is necessary,
in judging future events, to try to
find ihe motives of each side.
It would seem that Chiang Kai
Shek is in the right. If he wasn't,
lie would have committed mechan -
ized reserves and paratroopers
along time ago. Also, he has the
least interest in starting trouble.

Russia would have an excuse for
intervention, and America would be
split about supporting Chiang, be
cause too many of us are trying to
ascribe idealologies to this Far-
Eastern game of internal power
politics.
COMMUNISTS
But now comes the question, are
the Communists in the wrong?
Their strategy seems to be to take
over the -key northern areas of the
country and hold them strongly, so
they control the nation's economy,
and have a strong club over Chiang's
head.
The reason for this might come
from two sources. First of all, Sta
lin's reasons for signing a pact with
China might have been very ulter
ior. He might have realized that a
war with China would have brought
the United States on his neck, and
it would also have tied down troops
that would be necessary in imple
menting a strong foreign policy in
the west. Thus he may have tried
to neutralize China by treaty, and
be sure, by properly posting the
Communists, that that nation would
never be a threat to his rear.
If this is the case, then our policy
should be definitely in favor of aid
to Chiang, because this is necessary
not only to our own interests, but
to those of world peace.
