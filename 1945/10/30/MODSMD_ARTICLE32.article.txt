# On the Discs

### 
Dorsey Dilemma
Starting out badly, Tommy Dors
ey's latest disc, "The Door Will
Open," gets worse with each suc
ceeding groove. Featuring Stuart
Foster on the vocal, this record is
one of the poorest that T.D. has put
on in some time, and this is saying
quite a lot if you remember his oth
er recent atrocities. Foster's first
note makes you think that something
has gone radically wrong with your
machine, or Stuart had had radishes
for lunch.
The background supplied by the
Sentimentalists does nothing but
clutter up the record, and the trom
bone solo (if you can call it that)
by Dorsey himself makes one won
der why the Hoosier Hot Shots aren't
more popular. After listening to the
other side, "Aren't You Glad You're
You?" we weren't quite sure wheth
er we were or not. The tune, al
though not outstanding, could be
made much more listenable by a
decent arrangement and minus
Foster's vocal efforts.
To prove that we aren't just in a
bad mood and that there is such a
thing as a good commercial record,
we will now proceed to applaud
Capitol's latest release—Peggy Lee
singing "Waiting for the Train To
Come In," and "I'm Glad I Wailed
for You." With very capable as
sistance from her guitar-playing
husband, Dave Barbour, "Miss Lee"
once again illustrates that when one
is considered the tops in the vocal
field, she cannot be overlooked. Her
wonderful phrasing and interpreta
tion plus the rocking background
and Barbour's tasty solo make the
first side one of the best discs of
the day. The coupling is a very
pleasing rendition of a very pleas
ing tune and is once again high
lighted by the chh'ping of Peggy.
The only criticism of this record is
that of this second side there is far
too little of her hubby's guitar. Bar
bour, one of the best in the busi
ness, receives only a short bridge
between Peggy's choruses in which
to demonstrate his talent and "that
ain't right." But this is a minor
detail when one realizes the value
of these sides, and it should prove
i to be no hinderance as they climb
I up the ladder of best sellers.
That Drummin' Man
Back on the dreary side of things
we find the new Gene Krupa disc.
The two tunes, "That Feeling in the
Moonlight" and"I Don't Want to
Be Loved," are not essentially bad,
but the first is ruined by having
Krupa's arrangers revive the old,
out-of-date, stock, Jimmy Dorsey
scoring. This consists of first a slow
chorus by the crooner in the band,
Buddy Stewart in this case; and then
a double-time chorus by the female
thrush, here Anita O'Day.
There is only one slight difference
between this platter and the old JD
ones. There is a cut in time after
the O'Day chorus, and once again
Buddy Stewart comes back to really
finish the record. The only redeem
ing quality is Anita O'Day's vocal,
which helps justify her selection by
the nation's experts as the New Star
Female Vocalist in Esquire's annual
poll. The reverse is just another
record with a Harry James admirer
taking a pretty sad trumpet intro
duction. Vocal — Buddy Stewart
again!
Personality Plus
Johnny Mercer has once again hit
the juke box jack-pot. By his ren
dition of "Camptown Races"and
"Surprise Party," Mercer proves
that he is one of the greatest en
tertainers in the music world. Ste
phen Foster's (no relation to Stu
art) old folk song receives a very
novel and invigorating scoring from
arranger-conductor Paul Weston,
and Mercer's pleasing interpretation
is accompanied by one of the great
est vocal combinations in America,
the Pied Pipers. This side displays
Johnny at his refreshing best.
"Surprise Party," found by turning
the record over, is a very pleasant
surprise. It is an exceedingly clev
er novelty tune with Mercer again
on the vocal. Although very pleas
ant listening, this side has a little
to much Mercer personality and
voice-cracking to suit our taste.
Weston's band, one of the most ver
satile in the land, lends nice sup-
I port as Capitol Records comes
through with another hit.
Kenton-Cristy Combo Clicks
Stan Kenton seems to have made
quite a discovery in June Cristy of
"Tampico" fame. This vocalist, who
replaced Anta O'Day when she left
for Krupa's band, is at her best on
Kenton's newest platter. The tune,
"It's Been a Long, Long Time," is
a nice ditty, sung brilliantly by Miss
Cristy. With solid support from the
Kenton crew and especially from

the bass of Ed Safranski, formei
Hal Mclntyre sideman, the brassy
voice hipster must be given the
credit she deserves for this per
formance.
On the other side we find nothinj
but disappointment. With a Gem
Howard arrangement and vocal W(
feel that this number could not pos
sibly be a success. The scoring i
very mediocre, and Howard's vo
cal leaves us in a state of inde
cision. We can't decide which i
worse—Stuart Foster's aforemen
tioned efforts with Dorsey, or Gene'
not bending with the Kenton or
chestra.
Word to the Wise
Dorothy Baker's novel, which i:
based on the life of the now leg
endary trumpeter. Bix Beiderbecke
who died in 1931. is now availabh
in the Book Store in pocket siz(
edition. The book is entitlec
"Young Man With a Horn."

Johnny Mercer has once again hit
the juke box jack-pot. By his ren
dition of "Camptown Races"and
"Surprise Party," Mercer proves
that he is one of the greatest en
tertainers in the music world. Ste
phen Foster's (no relation to Stu
art) old folk song receives a very
novel and invigorating scoring from
arranger-conductor Paul Weston,
and Mercer's pleasing interpretation
is accompanied by one of the great
est vocal combinations in America,
the Pied Pipers. This side displays
Johnny at his refreshing best.
"Surprise Party," found by turning
the record over, is a very pleasant
surprise. It is an exceedingly clev
er novelty tune with Mercer again
on the vocal. Although very pleas
ant listening, this side has a little
to much Mercer personality and
voice-cracking to suit our taste.
Weston's band, one of the most ver
satile in the land, lends nice sup-
I port as Capitol Records comes
through with another hit.
Kenton-Cristy Combo Clicks
Stan Kenton seems to have made
quite a discovery in June Cristy of
"Tampico" fame. This vocalist, who
replaced Anta O'Day when she left
for Krupa's band, is at her best on
Kenton's newest platter. The tune,
"It's Been a Long, Long Time," is
a nice ditty, sung brilliantly by Miss
Cristy. With solid support from the
Kenton crew and especially from

the bass of Ed Safranski, formei
Hal Mclntyre sideman, the brassy
voice hipster must be given the
credit she deserves for this per
formance.
On the other side we find nothinj
but disappointment. With a Gem
Howard arrangement and vocal W(
feel that this number could not pos
sibly be a success. The scoring i
very mediocre, and Howard's vo
cal leaves us in a state of inde
cision. We can't decide which i
worse—Stuart Foster's aforemen
tioned efforts with Dorsey, or Gene'
not bending with the Kenton or
chestra.
Word to the Wise
Dorothy Baker's novel, which i:

endary trumpeter. Bix Beiderbecke

"Young Man With a Horn."
Dorsey Dilemma
Starting out badly, Tommy Dors
ey's latest disc, "The Door Will
Open," gets worse with each suc
ceeding groove. Featuring Stuart
Foster on the vocal, this record is
one of the poorest that T.D. has put
on in some time, and this is saying
quite a lot if you remember his oth
er recent atrocities. Foster's first
note makes you think that something
has gone radically wrong with your
machine, or Stuart had had radishes
for lunch.
The background supplied by the
Sentimentalists does nothing but
clutter up the record, and the trom
bone solo (if you can call it that)
by Dorsey himself makes one won
der why the Hoosier Hot Shots aren't
more popular. After listening to the
other side, "Aren't You Glad You're
You?" we weren't quite sure wheth
er we were or not. The tune, al
though not outstanding, could be
made much more listenable by a
decent arrangement and minus
Foster's vocal efforts.
To prove that we aren't just in a
bad mood and that there is such a
thing as a good commercial record,
we will now proceed to applaud
Capitol's latest release—Peggy Lee
singing "Waiting for the Train To
Come In," and "I'm Glad I Wailed
for You." With very capable as
sistance from her guitar-playing
husband, Dave Barbour, "Miss Lee"
once again illustrates that when one
is considered the tops in the vocal
field, she cannot be overlooked. Her
wonderful phrasing and interpreta
tion plus the rocking background
and Barbour's tasty solo make the
first side one of the best discs of
the day. The coupling is a very
pleasing rendition of a very pleas
ing tune and is once again high
lighted by the chh'ping of Peggy.
The only criticism of this record is
that of this second side there is far
too little of her hubby's guitar. Bar
bour, one of the best in the busi
ness, receives only a short bridge
between Peggy's choruses in which
to demonstrate his talent and "that
ain't right." But this is a minor
detail when one realizes the value
of these sides, and it should prove
i to be no hinderance as they climb
I up the ladder of best sellers.
That Drummin' Man
Back on the dreary side of things
we find the new Gene Krupa disc.
The two tunes, "That Feeling in the
Moonlight" and"I Don't Want to
Be Loved," are not essentially bad,
but the first is ruined by having
Krupa's arrangers revive the old,
out-of-date, stock, Jimmy Dorsey
scoring. This consists of first a slow
chorus by the crooner in the band,
Buddy Stewart in this case; and then
a double-time chorus by the female
thrush, here Anita O'Day.
There is only one slight difference
between this platter and the old JD
ones. There is a cut in time after
the O'Day chorus, and once again
Buddy Stewart comes back to really
finish the record. The only redeem
ing quality is Anita O'Day's vocal,
which helps justify her selection by

Foster on the vocal, this record is
one of the poorest that T.D. has put
on in some time, and this is saying
quite a lot if you remember his oth
er recent atrocities. Foster's first
note makes you think that something
has gone radically wrong with your
machine, or Stuart had had radishes
for lunch.
The background supplied by the
Sentimentalists does nothing but
clutter up the record, and the trom
bone solo (if you can call it that)
by Dorsey himself makes one won
der why the Hoosier Hot Shots aren't
more popular. After listening to the
other side, "Aren't You Glad You're
You?" we weren't quite sure wheth
er we were or not. The tune, al
though not outstanding, could be
made much more listenable by a
decent arrangement and minus
Foster's vocal efforts.
To prove that we aren't just in a
bad mood and that there is such a
thing as a good commercial record,
we will now proceed to applaud
Capitol's latest release—Peggy Lee
singing "Waiting for the Train To
Come In," and "I'm Glad I Wailed
for You." With very capable as
sistance from her guitar-playing
husband, Dave Barbour, "Miss Lee"
once again illustrates that when one
is considered the tops in the vocal
field, she cannot be overlooked. Her
wonderful phrasing and interpreta
tion plus the rocking background
and Barbour's tasty solo make the
first side one of the best discs of
the day. The coupling is a very
pleasing rendition of a very pleas
ing tune and is once again high
lighted by the chh'ping of Peggy.
The only criticism of this record is
that of this second side there is far
too little of her hubby's guitar. Bar
bour, one of the best in the busi
ness, receives only a short bridge
between Peggy's choruses in which
to demonstrate his talent and "that
ain't right." But this is a minor
detail when one realizes the value
of these sides, and it should prove
i to be no hinderance as they climb
I up the ladder of best sellers.
That Drummin' Man
Back on the dreary side of things
we find the new Gene Krupa disc.
The two tunes, "That Feeling in the
Moonlight" and"I Don't Want to
Be Loved," are not essentially bad,
but the first is ruined by having
Krupa's arrangers revive the old,
out-of-date, stock, Jimmy Dorsey
scoring. This consists of first a slow
chorus by the crooner in the band,
Buddy Stewart in this case; and then
a double-time chorus by the female
thrush, here Anita O'Day.
There is only one slight difference
between this platter and the old JD
ones. There is a cut in time after
the O'Day chorus, and once again
Buddy Stewart comes back to really
finish the record. The only redeem
ing quality is Anita O'Day's vocal,
which helps justify her selection by
the nation's experts as the New Star
Female Vocalist in Esquire's annual
poll. The reverse is just another
record with a Harry James admirer
taking a pretty sad trumpet intro
duction. Vocal — Buddy Stewart
again!

Johnny Mercer has once again hit
the juke box jack-pot. By his ren
dition of "Camptown Races"and
"Surprise Party," Mercer proves
that he is one of the greatest en
tertainers in the music world. Ste
phen Foster's (no relation to Stu
art) old folk song receives a very
novel and invigorating scoring from
arranger-conductor Paul Weston,
and Mercer's pleasing interpretation
is accompanied by one of the great
est vocal combinations in America,
the Pied Pipers. This side displays
Johnny at his refreshing best.
"Surprise Party," found by turning
the record over, is a very pleasant
surprise. It is an exceedingly clev
er novelty tune with Mercer again
on the vocal. Although very pleas
ant listening, this side has a little
to much Mercer personality and
voice-cracking to suit our taste.
Weston's band, one of the most ver
satile in the land, lends nice sup-
I port as Capitol Records comes
through with another hit.
Kenton-Cristy Combo Clicks
Stan Kenton seems to have made
quite a discovery in June Cristy of
"Tampico" fame. This vocalist, who
replaced Anta O'Day when she left
for Krupa's band, is at her best on
Kenton's newest platter. The tune,
"It's Been a Long, Long Time," is
a nice ditty, sung brilliantly by Miss
Cristy. With solid support from the
Kenton crew and especially from

the bass of Ed Safranski, formei
Hal Mclntyre sideman, the brassy
voice hipster must be given the
credit she deserves for this per
formance.
On the other side we find nothinj
but disappointment. With a Gem
Howard arrangement and vocal W(
feel that this number could not pos
sibly be a success. The scoring i
very mediocre, and Howard's vo
cal leaves us in a state of inde
cision. We can't decide which i
worse—Stuart Foster's aforemen
tioned efforts with Dorsey, or Gene'
not bending with the Kenton or
chestra.
