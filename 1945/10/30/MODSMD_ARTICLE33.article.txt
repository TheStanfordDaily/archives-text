# Music, Kelly Tops In 'Anchors Aweigh'
## 
### 
Gene Kelly with a mouse as dancing partner, yes .... Frank Sinatra
dancing on an army cot, yes .... but a final clinch chaperoned hy Jose
Iturbi, a licet admiral, and thousands of sailors .... that I cannot believe.
"Anchors Aweigh," now at the Stanford, is, however, a good musical.
It is one of the best musicals of the year, with Gene Kelly dominating the
show. Even Frank Sinatra is for- *

given reels of
wooden acting
when he sings "I
Fall in Love Too
Easily."
The fantasy in
which Kelly
teaches th e
mouse king to
dance is one of
the best i;e-
C| uences of the

show, and as one theater goer
was heard to remark, "Jose Iturbi
is almost as good as Hoagy Car
michael."
Dancing and singing is hung on
a loose plot, centering around the
attempts of Gene Kelly to find a
girl for his pal, Frank Sinatra. Si
natra picks out Kathryn Grayson,
and Kelly, the "sea wolf," begins
to operate .... all on behalf of his
pal, natch.
The whole situation is compli
cated by Kelly's promise that
Kathryn Grayson will be audi
tioned by Iturbi, and leads (he
two sailors from a movie studio
to the Hollywood Bowl, to say
nothing of minor entangling al
liances.
The one disappointment of the
show is that the mysterious "Lola,"
so aptly described by Kelly, never
appears. Kelly, however, is eventu
ally consoled by Kathryn Grayson,
and Sinatra finds a Brooklyn wait
ress more to his liking. Of course
she has to drop a bowl of soup on
him to make him realize the fact.
(Hashers, please do not follow.)
Kelly launches into gyrations
upon the slightest provocations,
and Sinatra turns in some good
songs .... "She Begged Me," and
"What Makes the Sun Rise," with
Brahm's "Lullabye" and a few
notes of "Tonight We Love"
thrown in for good measure.
One particularly good scene is
when Sinatra, mistaking Iturbi foi
a piano tuner, advises the pianis
to keep practicing because he real
ly shows some talent.
It's a temptation to take Kath
ryn Grayson's seven year old
nephew home from the Stanford
with you, and the Mexican hat
dance, interpreted by Kelly, bad
the Sunday afternoon audience
clapping right along with the
movie foreign element.
"Midnight Manhunt" is enough tc
make every member of the journal
ism department change his major
William Gargen and his feminine
cohort, both reporters, looked anc
talked like Neanderthal cavc
dwellers surprised to find them
selves in the 20th century.
A "who-done-it" that crept
from a flop house to a wax work,
to a railroad yard, to a ferry, it
almost died of malnutrition be
fore it ever finished the trip.
See "Anchors Aweigh" for gooc
entertainment, but don't let "Mid
night Manhunt" happen to you.â€”
