# Coots Win Army Fray
## 
### 
Fourth week games in AST bask
etball found the Lilywhiters, the
last undefeated team of the "C"
league, being toppled from their
lofty perch by the well stacked
Coots. It took a nip and tuck battle
to put a stopper on Capt. Martin's
boys but the scorebook showed only
eighteen points against the Coot's
nineteen.
The third of the "C" league's
powerhouse, the Chickens, had
much less difficulty in subduing
their opponents, the Giant Five,
45-9. A week previous, the
Chickens had upset the Coots in
a one point margin, double over
time brawl. This week's schedule
throws the Lilywhiters and the
Chickens into the same court —
which means but one thing, an
other close, hard-fought battle.
In the l 'A" league the Shushies
and the Atom-Bums, the loop's only
perfect record outfits, easily man
aged to keep their slates in a neat
condition. The Shushies downed the
dangerous Bums, 24-16, while the
Atom-Bums took a forfeit victory
from the deflated Zippers. A match
between the unbeaten is on deck
this Wednesday evening as these
Goliaths collide.
The only other game played in
the two EM loops was a 16-15 tus
sle between the B. F.'s and the Vita-
Men. The latter outfit was slightly
deficient and fell as victims of
their opponents last half rally. An
other tilt, Runts vs. A.T.&Q. Club,
was awarded to the midgets via the
forfeit method.
Three engagements were played
oft' among the ERC's with the
winners in each case scoring
forty or more points. The Cors
airs bested the Tan of O. 45-25,
as Jennings, Barton, and Mooney
staged individual scoring sprees.
The former two's combined ef
forts easily overcame Mooney and
his mathematicians.
The other lopsided frays had the
Li'l Papooses trampling the Zig-
Zags, 40-17, and the Buzz-Bombs
pounding the Diablo Devils into sub
mission, 42-10.
On Nov. 7, AST cagers will swing
their attention to an all team elimi
nation tournament, the winner of
which will be batallion champion.

from the deflated Zippers. A match
between the unbeaten is on deck
this Wednesday evening as these
Goliaths collide.
The only other game played in
the two EM loops was a 16-15 tus
sle between the B. F.'s and the Vita-
Men. The latter outfit was slightly
deficient and fell as victims of
their opponents last half rally. An
other tilt, Runts vs. A.T.&Q. Club,
was awarded to the midgets via the
forfeit method.
Three engagements were played
oft' among the ERC's with the
winners in each case scoring
forty or more points. The Cors
airs bested the Tan of O. 45-25,
as Jennings, Barton, and Mooney
staged individual scoring sprees.
The former two's combined ef
forts easily overcame Mooney and
his mathematicians.
The other lopsided frays had the
Li'l Papooses trampling the Zig-
Zags, 40-17, and the Buzz-Bombs
pounding the Diablo Devils into sub
mission, 42-10.
On Nov. 7, AST cagers will swing
their attention to an all team elimi
nation tournament, the winner of
which will be batallion champion.
Fourth week games in AST bask
etball found the Lilywhiters, the
last undefeated team of the "C"
league, being toppled from their
lofty perch by the well stacked
Coots. It took a nip and tuck battle
to put a stopper on Capt. Martin's
boys but the scorebook showed only
eighteen points against the Coot's
nineteen.
The third of the "C" league's
powerhouse, the Chickens, had
much less difficulty in subduing
their opponents, the Giant Five,
45-9. A week previous, the
Chickens had upset the Coots in
a one point margin, double over
time brawl. This week's schedule
throws the Lilywhiters and the
Chickens into the same court —
which means but one thing, an
other close, hard-fought battle.
In the l 'A" league the Shushies
and the Atom-Bums, the loop's only
perfect record outfits, easily man
aged to keep their slates in a neat
condition. The Shushies downed the
dangerous Bums, 24-16, while the
Atom-Bums took a forfeit victory
from the deflated Zippers. A match
between the unbeaten is on deck
