### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 29 (UP).
â€”Chilean President Juan Antonio
Rios today urged the United States
to provide shipping facilities for his
country so that Chile could once
again become a good producer for
the United States and especially
California.
President Rios, in the second of a
three-day visit to the San Francisco
Bay area, told a press conference
that Chile sought increased markets
for her nitrate but was temporarily
stalled by lack of shipping.
"We have been doing everything
possible to establish closer relations
with California," Rios said. ''Now
we seek the cooperation of the
United States."
Rios will dine tonight with Gov.
Earl Warren of California, Mayor
Roger Lapham of San Francisco,
high-ranking Army and Navy offi
cials and the 14-mcmber party of
Chilean and American officials ac
companying him on his tour of the
United States. He will leave for
Los Angeles Tuesday night.
