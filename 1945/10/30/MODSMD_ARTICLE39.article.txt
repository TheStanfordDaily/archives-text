Although there haven't been many Irish monickers on the
Notre Dame grid roster for many years, the Fighting Irish still
continue to have the most colorful gridiron history of any eleven
in the history of the game. Year after year the team from South
Bend, Indiana, continues to be the greatest drawing attraction
second to no other eleven in the nation.
IRISH HISTORY OUTSTANDING
Why Because the Irish never disappoint the paying cus
tomer, or even the interested radio listener. Every year for
as long as you would care to remember, Notre Dame has
played the toughest schedule of any college team in the nation:
Army, Navy, Georgia Tech, and Northwestern are always
included on their list.
Notre Dame tradition seems to stem from immortal Knute
Rockne, who developed Notre Dame into a team to be feared by
all comers. It was he, who while still attending school, teamed
up with Gus Dorais to develop the little used forward pass,
an innovation that led to the Irishmen's stunning upset of mighty
Aruy that year. Rockne put such great players and player com
binations as the Four Horsemen, George Gipp, and the Seven
Mules on the field and gave Notre Dame a reputation to live
up to —and it has.
ROCKNE'S IDEAL—
But now to get to the point I wish to talk about. Rockne also
fought for an ideal. He wanted to keep from making a business
out of college football. He believed that the game should serve
the purpose of making finer men; men who would let the sports
manship and fair play they had learned in football carry over
into their life after college. He wanted football to put men in
matchless physical condition.
Proselyting players, which means nothing more than pay
ing a player to play in college, is now almost the sole method
by which colleges obtain future grid stars. From the stand
point of the universities all over the nation, proselyting has
its good features. A good football team is a good source of
revenue at the box office, and I suppose even economists have
a theory that states that a good commodity brings a good price.
PROSELYTING RULES y
Not much has been done to squelch this buying of players,
and so the "Rock's" ideal has been smothered and almost for
gotten. Here on the Pacific Coast, a number of rules have been
drawn up concerning proselyting, and there was a time when the
name Edwin Atherton meant a headache to .many coast con
ference schools.
One of those rules stated that if any school, and that in
cluded alumni of that school, even suggested that a person,
whether he was a good athlete or not, attend that school, he
was forever barred from participating in athletics at that school.
Mr. Atherton enforced that rule to the limit. Of course, the
buying of players still went on in the most unhor/ manner,
and as yet no solution has been offered, but the question of
whether or not a team should be doomed to mediocrity because
of its low purchasing power is certainly something for someone
to think about.

IRISH HISTORY OUTSTANDING
Why Because the Irish never disappoint the paying cus
tomer, or even the interested radio listener. Every year for
as long as you would care to remember, Notre Dame has
played the toughest schedule of any college team in the nation:
Army, Navy, Georgia Tech, and Northwestern are always
included on their list.
Notre Dame tradition seems to stem from immortal Knute
Rockne, who developed Notre Dame into a team to be feared by
all comers. It was he, who while still attending school, teamed
up with Gus Dorais to develop the little used forward pass,
an innovation that led to the Irishmen's stunning upset of mighty
Aruy that year. Rockne put such great players and player com
binations as the Four Horsemen, George Gipp, and the Seven
Mules on the field and gave Notre Dame a reputation to live
up to —and it has.
ROCKNE'S IDEAL—
But now to get to the point I wish to talk about. Rockne also
fought for an ideal. He wanted to keep from making a business
out of college football. He believed that the game should serve
the purpose of making finer men; men who would let the sports
manship and fair play they had learned in football carry over
into their life after college. He wanted football to put men in
matchless physical condition.
Proselyting players, which means nothing more than pay
ing a player to play in college, is now almost the sole method
by which colleges obtain future grid stars. From the stand
point of the universities all over the nation, proselyting has
its good features. A good football team is a good source of
revenue at the box office, and I suppose even economists have
a theory that states that a good commodity brings a good price.
PROSELYTING RULES y
Not much has been done to squelch this buying of players,
and so the "Rock's" ideal has been smothered and almost for
gotten. Here on the Pacific Coast, a number of rules have been
drawn up concerning proselyting, and there was a time when the
name Edwin Atherton meant a headache to .many coast con
ference schools.
One of those rules stated that if any school, and that in
cluded alumni of that school, even suggested that a person,
whether he was a good athlete or not, attend that school, he
was forever barred from participating in athletics at that school.
Mr. Atherton enforced that rule to the limit. Of course, the
buying of players still went on in the most unhor/ manner,
and as yet no solution has been offered, but the question of
whether or not a team should be doomed to mediocrity because
of its low purchasing power is certainly something for someone
to think about.
Although there haven't been many Irish monickers on the
Notre Dame grid roster for many years, the Fighting Irish still
continue to have the most colorful gridiron history of any eleven
in the history of the game. Year after year the team from South
Bend, Indiana, continues to be the greatest drawing attraction
second to no other eleven in the nation.
