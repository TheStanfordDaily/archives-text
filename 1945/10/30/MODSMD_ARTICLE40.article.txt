Watching California struggle against little Nevada Saturday
we couldn't help wonder if the red coat of paint the C was
sporting and the big creosote "S" in front of the Cal bench
weren't more interesting than the game itself. Until the last 90
seconds of play, Cal was tied 6-6 and lucky to have that. Their
touchdown had come as the result of an intercepted pass.

Now hating Cal has been a fa
vorite Stanford pastime but we're
not exhibiting prejudice when we
say that Cal was pretty poor Sat
urday. Nevada, the same team that
St. Mary's rode over 39-0, the same
team that lost to Tulsa 40-0 last
week, was on a par with the Golden
Bear.
Besides this, Nevada's two star
backs were out of the game and
their star linesman was injured in
the second half. Add to this the fact
that Nevada had traveled 2,000 miles
from Oklahoma to Berkeley in six
days of uncomfortable traveling.
You see, we can't help but won
der what's happened to the Gold
en Bear. Buck Shaw, one of the
ablest of the nation's coaches, is
guiding the Bears. We can't sec
any trouble from the coaching
viewpoint. California has close to
20,000 students from which to
draw for a football team. They've
even got two Stanford boys, Theo
Kenfield and Bill Agnew, in the
lineup. We can't sec that mate
rial is lacking.
We heard that the California stu
dent body spirit is lacking. Well,
they seem to yell loud enough for
us. Their spirit seems to be undi
minished week after week. No, that
isn't the reason for the shabbiness
of the Bear.
Are you beginning to wonder too?
What's happened to the old Cal we
used to know? Andy Smith's won
der teams? Stub Allison's '37 grid
giant? Has the caliber of Cal foot
ball gone down or are their oppo
nents getting better?
California, along with the In
dians, used to be the power of
Northern California football. Add
U.S.C. in the South and you had
the big three of the Coast Con
ference. Have (he Bears been re
duced to a second-rate power that
has to go all-out in the last 90
seconds to beat little Nevada?
Now, as much rivalry and preju
dice as we have, we hate to see our

old opponent looking as shabby as
it does. We want to see the Big
Game decide the P.C.C. again. We'd
like Cal to be a major power so
we'd get a thrill out of playing
against them. We hate to see little
Nevada scare the big Bear.
