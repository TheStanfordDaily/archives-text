(This is reprint from an article
sent to us by one of our cor
respondents at Northwestern
University.)
The headline of the story read,
NU Students Vote Army Top Team
in the Country.
By 808 SCHAULL
Students overwhelmingly chose
Army is the best college football
team in the country in an informal
poll conducted throughout the NU
campus by five DAILY (Daily
Northwestern) sports writers.
VVe read the article with casual
interest, and aside from the fact
that we didn't agree with the re
sults of the poll, we were sur
prised at not a small misappre
hension on the part of the polices.
Poll follows:
1. Army 148
2. Navy 49
3. Ohio State 43
4. Michigan 42
5. Notre Dame 3(5
6. Minnesota 33
7. Northwestern 11
8. Illinois 5
9. Purdue 4
10. STANFOKD 3
11. lowa State 3
Wonder what Cal will think of
this.
