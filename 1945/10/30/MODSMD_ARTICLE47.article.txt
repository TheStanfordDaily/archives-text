# Cardinals To Meet Stockton Commandos
## 
### 
Stanford has a football schedule
for this season. On Nov. 17, the
post-war Big Red Machine meets
the Stockton Commandos. Two
weeks later, on the Ist of December,
Stanford runs into the San 'Mateo
Merchant Marine Academy. No tilt
has been lined up for Nov. 10, as
yet.
Both games will be played in
the Stanford stadium. Admission
will be free. Neither opponents are
of Fleet City caliber, but they will
provide ample competition for the
inexperienced Stanford eleven. The
Stockton team, which is comprised
of air force and ordnance pei-son
nel. has had a fairly successful sea
son.
Farm Opponents
They tied the Albany Navy ag
gregation. 20-20; lost to St. Mary's,
26-o—which is definitely no dis
grace, considering- the- Hevman
Wedemeyer, Dennis O'Connor, Spike
Cordeiro opposition; and they whip
ped McClellan Field 27-0. Who per
forms for the' team is not known at
the moment, except that a fellow
named Kriegar—who collegiately
toted the pigskin for Dartmouth
is on the team.
The San Mateo team is complete
ly unknown, except that in three

games they have scored over 100
points. Opposition has been in the
form of bay area junior colleges. A
number of other teams have can
celled games with the San Mateo
outfit, which in a negative sort of
way, adds to the prestige of the
team.
Stanford Progress
According to Marchie Schwartz,
head coach, the Stanford team is
progressing satisfactory. Plays are
being ironed out, and the line is
improving on blocking. Only one
hour a day is allowed for practice,
and taking into consideration the
fact that the team is very inex
perienced, the squad mentor is most
satisfied.
The purpose of the informal con
tests lined up is to provide expe
rience for the team, which goes
back to a regular Pacific Coast Con
ference schedule next fall. These
games will not interfere with eligi
bility rules, and no letters will be
awarded for work this fall.Levin

team.
Stanford Progress
According to Marchie Schwartz,
head coach, the Stanford team is
progressing satisfactory. Plays are
being ironed out, and the line is
improving on blocking. Only one
hour a day is allowed for practice,
and taking into consideration the
fact that the team is very inex
perienced, the squad mentor is most
satisfied.
The purpose of the informal con
tests lined up is to provide expe
rience for the team, which goes
back to a regular Pacific Coast Con
ference schedule next fall. These
games will not interfere with eligi
bility rules, and no letters will be
awarded for work this fall.Levin

Stanford has a football schedule
for this season. On Nov. 17, the
post-war Big Red Machine meets
the Stockton Commandos. Two
weeks later, on the Ist of December,
Stanford runs into the San 'Mateo
Merchant Marine Academy. No tilt
has been lined up for Nov. 10, as
yet.
Both games will be played in
the Stanford stadium. Admission
will be free. Neither opponents are
of Fleet City caliber, but they will
provide ample competition for the
inexperienced Stanford eleven. The
Stockton team, which is comprised
of air force and ordnance pei-son
nel. has had a fairly successful sea
son.
Farm Opponents
They tied the Albany Navy ag
gregation. 20-20; lost to St. Mary's,
26-o—which is definitely no dis
grace, considering- the- Hevman
Wedemeyer, Dennis O'Connor, Spike
Cordeiro opposition; and they whip
ped McClellan Field 27-0. Who per
forms for the' team is not known at
the moment, except that a fellow
named Kriegar—who collegiately
toted the pigskin for Dartmouth
is on the team.
The San Mateo team is complete
ly unknown, except that in three

games they have scored over 100
points. Opposition has been in the
form of bay area junior colleges. A
number of other teams have can
celled games with the San Mateo
outfit, which in a negative sort of
way, adds to the prestige of the
team.
