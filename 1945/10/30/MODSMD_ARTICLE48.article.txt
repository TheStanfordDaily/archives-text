# Tyler Typhoon Hits Saturday
## 
### BILL FILERS 
Tylermen are determined. So de
termined in fact that come rain,
wind and filoods, they're willing to
call it a typhoon and still hold their
South Sea Island dance Saturday
night from 9 to 1.
Overlooking the entire campus,
Tyler, high in the Santa Clara hills,
invites all guys and gals in sport
coats, sarongs, raincoats, or tuxes
to be their guests for four hours of
smooth transcribed music, soft
lights, and delicious, nutritious
punch.
Said Tyler President Willie Da
vies, "We're still going to make this
the best Tyler dance of the year,
the most romantic our house has
ever had."
Davies, wearing a sarong himself,
and Newt Arnold, wearing a new
hula skirt, suggested guests wear
anything "they'd like to be ship
wrecked in."
