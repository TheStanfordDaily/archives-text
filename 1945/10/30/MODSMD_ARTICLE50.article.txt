The chrysanthemum tea was
started in the 1920s and was held
at the Herbert Hoover home for
several years. Flowers, gourds, and
harvest fruits were all sold on the
lawns below the house. Girls in
costume walked around selling
baskets of homemade candies.
Singers, Band Entertain
Strolling singers went from group
to group singing ballads. The Stan
ford band would arrive later in the
afternoon and play from the foot
of the garden.
According to Mrs. Robert Cody,
past president of the Mothers' Club
and chairman of several of the teas,
about 1500 to 2,000 people attended
the teas and regular parking squads
had to handle the traffic.
Held in Women's Gym
After Mr. Hoover became presi
dent, the teas were held in the
Women's gym. Entertainment con
sisted of strolling singers and chor
als. The teas emphasized the sale
of chrysanthemums and specialty
sales were candy, cookies, and
gourds.
Past members of the Mothers'
Club and the mothers of all Stan
ford students are invited to the tea.
Students are welcome, but seldom
come. Mothers from all over central
California come, Mrs. Cody said.
Ticket sales are carried on all over
this area too.
Sponsors Spring Festival
For several years the chrysanthe
mum tea was the only Mothers'
Club benefit. Then in 1929 the Club
began having its spring festival.
The first festival was held at the
home of Mrs. Paul Shoup, a past
Mothers' Club president. It was held
there for several years and then
changed to some large estate.
Several times it was held in the
Frost Ampitheater. An original
pageant by some well-known local
writer was usually given. During
the war the spring festival was also
dropped.
Donations from Mothers
Last year, Mrs. Cody said, the
Mothers' Club held a "phantom
party" in the spring. Only the
mothers sent in donations, so that
more money was raised than at an
actual party.

The chrysanthemum tea was
started in the 1920s and was held
at the Herbert Hoover home for
several years. Flowers, gourds, and
harvest fruits were all sold on the
lawns below the house. Girls in
costume walked around selling
baskets of homemade candies.
Singers, Band Entertain
Strolling singers went from group
to group singing ballads. The Stan
ford band would arrive later in the
afternoon and play from the foot
of the garden.
According to Mrs. Robert Cody,
past president of the Mothers' Club
and chairman of several of the teas,
about 1500 to 2,000 people attended
the teas and regular parking squads
had to handle the traffic.
Held in Women's Gym
After Mr. Hoover became presi
dent, the teas were held in the
Women's gym. Entertainment con
sisted of strolling singers and chor
als. The teas emphasized the sale
of chrysanthemums and specialty
sales were candy, cookies, and
gourds.
Past members of the Mothers'
Club and the mothers of all Stan
ford students are invited to the tea.
Students are welcome, but seldom
come. Mothers from all over central
California come, Mrs. Cody said.
Ticket sales are carried on all over
this area too.
Sponsors Spring Festival
For several years the chrysanthe
mum tea was the only Mothers'
Club benefit. Then in 1929 the Club
began having its spring festival.
The first festival was held at the
home of Mrs. Paul Shoup, a past
Mothers' Club president. It was held
there for several years and then
changed to some large estate.
Several times it was held in the
Frost Ampitheater. An original
pageant by some well-known local
writer was usually given. During
the war the spring festival was also
dropped.
Donations from Mothers
Last year, Mrs. Cody said, the
Mothers' Club held a "phantom
party" in the spring. Only the
mothers sent in donations, so that
more money was raised than at an
actual party.
