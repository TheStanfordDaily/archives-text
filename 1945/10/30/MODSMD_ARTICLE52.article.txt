PARIS, Oct. 29 (UP). —Maurice
Schuman, vigorous young president
of the Mouvement Republican Po
pulate, said yesterday his party is
prepared to co-operate fully with
the Communists and Socialists in a
new three-party coalition govern
ment, and added that France's gen
eral elections had vastly strength
ened Gen. Charles De Gaulle's pres
tige.
"Our desire in the MRP is that
no party should be excluded from
the government, provided it accepts
the reforms contained in the Na
tional Resistance Council's charter,"
Schuman told the United Press.
"There is really no reason why the
lesser parties as well as the big
three should not be represented
also."
The MRP, founded a year ago, is
the party of France's Foreign Min
ister Georges Bidault. In the recent
elections it emerged sensationally
as France's second strongest party.
Schuman, its president, was for
three war years the "Voice of Free
France" in BBC's French language
programs.
"A coalition government should
be formed without difficulty—if all
parties show good will," said Schu
man. "In this respect the attitude
of the Socialist leader Leon Blum
and his articles and speeches have
played a decisive role." He said the
elections seem to have made a coa
litio ngovernment—one of national
union—essential for France.
He said the first job of the new
constituent assembly will be to
elect a head of the state and "no
one doubts that it will be General
De Gaulle in accordance with the
expressed wishes of the nation."
