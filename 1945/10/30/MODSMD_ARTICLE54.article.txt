## Communist Troops In Manchurian Ports 
### 
CHUNGKING, Tuesday, Oct. 30
(UP). â€”Chinese Communists have
massed troops around three main
ports of Southern Manchuria to bar
any attempted landings of Central
Government forces from U. S. Navy
ships, and are deploying in strength
along South Manchurian railways,
it was reported today.
The Communists reportedly
learned of plans to transport gov
ernment troops to Hulutao, Ying
kow and Antung, in southern Man
churia in vessels of the U. S. 7th
Fleet. Under orders of Gen. Chang
Hseuh Sheh, son of the late war
lord Marshal Chang Tso-Lin of
Manchuria, they hurried to defend
the ports.
Soviet forces ejected the Japan
ese from Manchuria in the brief
campaign which preceded Japan's
surrender. They have announced
their intention of withdrawing in
accordance with terms of the Soviet-
Chinese treaty signed at Moscow a
few months ago, and the central
government was scheduled to take
over the area.
A well-informed government
source revealed that Communist Bth
Route Army detachments had con
centrated at four new and nearly
completed bases behind the three
seaports, as well as around the ports
themselves.
Bases, this source said, were lo
cated at Chinhsien, behind Hulutao;
Liaoyang and Haicheng, 40 and 70
miles respectively south-southwest
of Mukden, covering the port of
Lingkow at the mouth of the Liao
river; and Fengcheng, 90 miles
south-southeast of Mukden, behind
Antung.
These base points all are located
along the railroads which central
government troops would be com
pelled to use to make any penetra
tion of the heart of Manchuria, in
cluding lines of the all-important
south Manchuria railway.
The government sources said
Communist Bth Route Army men
had been rushing work on the bases
for the past 10 days and had almost
completed them.
Central News Agency reported
that Chungking Communications
Minister Yu Fei-Pcng, had visited
the port of Chinwangtao, 135 miles
northeast of Tientsin, in an effort
to clear the way for movement of
central government troops along the
railway to Mukden, which passes
through.
