Anti-tank guns were emplaced
at 9 p.m. near the railway station
which is across the street from the
war ministry.
Suburban inhabitants were ad

might be suspended any moment.
A rapid series of events started
with the announcement that Benja

Getulio Vargas, had been named
police chief of Rio de Janeiro, suc

the big plaza facing the Ministry.
A company of guardsmen armed
with rifles and machine guns took
up combat positions in front of the
War Ministry and along the route
between the Foreign Ministry—the
Itamarty Palace—and the Central
