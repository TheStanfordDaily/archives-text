### 
CHINWANGTAO, North China,
Oct. 29 (UP). —The possibility de
veloped tonight that Chinese Com
munist forces may have started a
withdrawal to defensive positions
al6ng the great wall of China 16
miles north of here, as violence
dwindled along the Chinwangtao-
Tientsin railroad.
The number of Nationalist troops
at this important but little known
North China port, 170 miles north
east of Tientsin on the Gulf of
Liaolung, increased materially. They
had been transported from Tientsin
without Communist interference.
U. S. Marines reported Commun
ists pulled out of Pei Tai Ho, junc
tion of two strongholds between
Marine-occupied cities. Lt. John J.
Gormley, commander of the First
Marine Division battalion which
controls Chinwangtao, said he
had not seen any Communists for
two days.
However the Communist Eighth
Route Army apparently still is de
termined to prevent rail movements
north of here, and the railway run
ning to Shanhaikwam, astride the
Great Wall, was cut at three points.
The situation in North China re
mained explosive. The confusion
over the Chiang Kai Shek-Mao Tze-
Tung "unity" conferences in Chung
king was not easing the situation.
