Ouija boards in the Stanford
Bookstore? Yes, along with paper
elips, lab coats, and biology dis
secting sets in the miscellaneous de
partment.
"Well," explained Mrs. H. T. Bau
chou, in a recent interview, "the
store's maintained for the conven
ience of students and faculty, and
if they want ouija boards mixed in
with their textbooks and drawing
paper, that's what we have."
She went on to explain that there
are five departments besides the
miscellaneous department in the
Bookstore—textbook, general book,
typewriter sales and service, sta
tionery and gift departments, and
the office.
"Originally, the oflice was the
anti-social department of the store,"
said Mrs. Bauchou, "existing solely
to take care of the store's accounting
and financial matters. Things have
changed, though." she added, "since
students discovered that, hidden in
the back of the store, was an office
that could and would cash checks—
even checks for more than five dol
lars."
Mrs. G. Cook and Beth Rubin,
two of the Bookstore's office em
ployees, lamented the fact that their
gratis service had developed into the
cashing of an average of 400 checks
a day.
"Still," added Mrs. Cook, "you
become rather attached to some of
them—the ones we see every day.
They're the ones who make out
checks for one or two dollars, so
that they can't possibly do anything
more extravagant than spending an
hour or so at the Cellar."

There are others who go to the
opposite, however, she said, and ask
to have their checks cashed in large
bills. "Their philosophy seems to
be that they'll be able to save mon
ey, because no one on campus will
be able to cash the checks," she
added.
Miss Rubin was a bit harsher in
her criticism of their check custom
ers, and said she wished that Stan
ford students would learn to write.
"They scratch something at the
bottom of the check," she com
plained, "and then become insulted
if we ask for a transcription."
Mrs. Bauchou pointed out that
nearly every day she'i approached
by amazed customers who've found
something new that the Bookstore
handles. "Really," said Mrs. Bau
chou, "you can find anything here—
or you will be able to find it, as
soon as we put it on order."
One thing that often surprises
people, according to Mrs. Bauchou,
is the Bookstore's mail order busi
ness. "This mail order business has
increased considerably during the
war," she said, "since many Stan
ford people have been stationed in
remote places where technical
equipment and materials are not
available."
The manager pointed out that the
greatest volume of mail order busi
ness is in special drawing materials,
technical books, and other special
ized materials. She added, how
ever, that often orders for Stanford
jewelry and luggage stickers are
received.
"Some of our mail order custom
ers deposit a sum of money with us
at the beginning of the year," said
Mrs. Bauchou, "and then draw on
that all during the year."
The Bookstore's history extends
back nearly to the founding of the
University itself in 1891. The Book
store was established shortly after
that date, thus becoming the first
co-operative in California.
The Bookstore is an agent of the
students, Mrs. Bauchou pointed out,
and they receive refunds on their

purchases at the end of the year
for all profits above expenses. "The
rate of rebates varies," she added,
"in accordance with the national fi
nancial situation. Last year, stu
dents received 10 per cent refunds
on all of their purchases."
She stated that all refunds are
made on the basis of the yellow
slips which the customer receives
with each purchase. "Those slips
are worth money," said Mrs. Bau
chou, "and they must be presented
at the office before any rebate
money may be issued."

The Bookstore is an agent of the
students, Mrs. Bauchou pointed out,
and they receive refunds on their

purchases at the end of the year
for all profits above expenses. "The
rate of rebates varies," she added,
"in accordance with the national fi
nancial situation. Last year, stu
dents received 10 per cent refunds
on all of their purchases."
She stated that all refunds are
made on the basis of the yellow
slips which the customer receives
with each purchase. "Those slips
are worth money," said Mrs. Bau
chou, "and they must be presented
at the office before any rebate
money may be issued."
Ouija boards in the Stanford
Bookstore? Yes, along with paper
elips, lab coats, and biology dis
secting sets in the miscellaneous de
partment.
"Well," explained Mrs. H. T. Bau
chou, in a recent interview, "the
store's maintained for the conven
ience of students and faculty, and
if they want ouija boards mixed in
with their textbooks and drawing
paper, that's what we have."
She went on to explain that there
are five departments besides the
miscellaneous department in the
Bookstore—textbook, general book,
typewriter sales and service, sta
tionery and gift departments, and
the office.
"Originally, the oflice was the
anti-social department of the store,"
said Mrs. Bauchou, "existing solely
to take care of the store's accounting
and financial matters. Things have
changed, though." she added, "since
students discovered that, hidden in
the back of the store, was an office
that could and would cash checks—
even checks for more than five dol
lars."
Mrs. G. Cook and Beth Rubin,
two of the Bookstore's office em
ployees, lamented the fact that their
gratis service had developed into the
cashing of an average of 400 checks
a day.
"Still," added Mrs. Cook, "you
become rather attached to some of
them—the ones we see every day.
They're the ones who make out
checks for one or two dollars, so
that they can't possibly do anything
more extravagant than spending an
hour or so at the Cellar."

There are others who go to the
opposite, however, she said, and ask
to have their checks cashed in large
bills. "Their philosophy seems to
be that they'll be able to save mon
ey, because no one on campus will
be able to cash the checks," she
added.
Miss Rubin was a bit harsher in
her criticism of their check custom
ers, and said she wished that Stan
ford students would learn to write.
"They scratch something at the
bottom of the check," she com
plained, "and then become insulted
if we ask for a transcription."
Mrs. Bauchou pointed out that
nearly every day she'i approached
by amazed customers who've found
something new that the Bookstore
handles. "Really," said Mrs. Bau
chou, "you can find anything here—
or you will be able to find it, as
soon as we put it on order."
One thing that often surprises
people, according to Mrs. Bauchou,
is the Bookstore's mail order busi
ness. "This mail order business has
increased considerably during the
war," she said, "since many Stan
ford people have been stationed in
remote places where technical
equipment and materials are not
available."
The manager pointed out that the
greatest volume of mail order busi
ness is in special drawing materials,
technical books, and other special
ized materials. She added, how
ever, that often orders for Stanford
jewelry and luggage stickers are
received.
"Some of our mail order custom
ers deposit a sum of money with us
at the beginning of the year," said
Mrs. Bauchou, "and then draw on
that all during the year."
The Bookstore's history extends
back nearly to the founding of the
University itself in 1891. The Book
store was established shortly after
that date, thus becoming the first
co-operative in California.

ized materials. She added, how
ever, that often orders for Stanford
jewelry and luggage stickers are
received.
"Some of our mail order custom
ers deposit a sum of money with us
at the beginning of the year," said
Mrs. Bauchou, "and then draw on
that all during the year."
The Bookstore's history extends
back nearly to the founding of the
University itself in 1891. The Book
store was established shortly after
that date, thus becoming the first
co-operative in California.
The Bookstore is an agent of the
students, Mrs. Bauchou pointed out,
and they receive refunds on their

purchases at the end of the year
for all profits above expenses. "The
rate of rebates varies," she added,
"in accordance with the national fi
nancial situation. Last year, stu
dents received 10 per cent refunds
on all of their purchases."
She stated that all refunds are
made on the basis of the yellow
slips which the customer receives
with each purchase. "Those slips
are worth money," said Mrs. Bau
chou, "and they must be presented
at the office before any rebate
money may be issued."
