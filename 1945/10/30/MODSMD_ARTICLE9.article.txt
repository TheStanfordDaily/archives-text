# Wage Increase Expected

WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (UP). —Informed sources predicted
tonight that President Truman will recommend, in his wage
price policy speech tomorrow night, a basic wage rate increase
sufficient to compensate workers for loss of wartime take-home
pay but without boosting general price levels.
Mr. Truman will recommend, it was said, that price increases
be allowed only in cases where producers are squeezed by wage
raises and present price ceilings. Even then the producer must
prove need for price relief. This would be done through existing
machinery—the wage stabilization branch of the War Labor
Board, the OPA, and the Office of Economic Stabilization.
