In 1942 a spccial committee of
the American Council of Learned
Societies was formed to plan for
the preservation of ancient monu
ments and cultural treasures in
European battle areas. Out of the
ACLS committee grew the Am
erican Commission for the Protec
tion and Salvage of Artistic and
Historical Monuments in Europe,
created by the late President
Roosevelt in August, 1943.
Working through the Department
of State, the commission's activities
included map-making, preparation
of manuals for distribution to front
line troops and bombing squadrons,
reports by monuments officers on
destruction and looting, and gen
eral lectures given in schools of
military government. Later the
work of the commission was broad
ened to include the Far East.
As the first European representa
tive of the commission, Mr. Dins
moor spent the spring and early
summer of 1944 in England and
Italy. He helped to form another
commission for the protection of
historical treasures and served as
liaison officer between the com
mission and the army.
In his lecture tonight Mr. Dins
moor will tell of the plans and
work on the commission and report
on the condition of European and
Oriental cultural treasures and his
torical monuments.
Head of the department of
archaeology at Columbia, Mr.
Dinsmoor has written widely in
his spccial field. He is president
of the Archaeological Institute
of America and an editor of "The
American Journal of Archae
ology."
Long associated with the Ameri
can School of Classical Studies in
Athens, he has worked on the re
storation of the ancient buildings on
the Acropolis and has been dec
orated by the Greek government.
