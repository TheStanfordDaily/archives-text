# $500 Damage In Farm Fire
## 
### 
A fire which broke out in one
room on the second floor of the
helps' quarters near the Con Home
last night, caused approximately
$500 in damages to the building,
reported Stanford Fire Department
Chief John Marston. No one was
injured in the blaze, he said.
The building, one of the original
structures on the old Stanford farm,
is located about half a block from
the main dwelling which houses the
convalescent children. The children
were at no time endangered by the
fire, Chief Marston said.
Cause of the fire, which broke out
at 8:16 p.m., was attributed to an
over-heated heater, according to
Chief Marston. Damage was con
fined to one room only, he added.
Flames were pouring out the window
of the room when firemen arrived,
said Chief Marston, and were fan
ned by a strong wind. The fire was
under control after about six or
seven minutes, however, he re
ported.
