To the members of (he A.S.S.U.:
Last Friday the Big "C" was painted red. The finder of suspieion
points right at certain members of the Stanford Student Body. Your
student officials find it difficult to understand the reason why Stanford

men should commit such an act.
Perhaps you do not know the
glorious history behind the Axe? If
not, you can read all about it in
the article below.
Perhaps you are not familiar
with the agreement between the
University of California and Stan
ford University. We quote from the
A.S.S.U. Executive Committee min
utes of Tuesday, December 8, 1936.

"BIG GAME RAIDS AGREEMENT"
'In order to avoid anv occurrence that might en
danger the friendly relations between our Universities
for so many years, and in order to maintain the fine
sportsmanship that has been the tradition of our

'Big Game,' we, the representatives of our student bodies, de hereby
resolve:
(a) 'That there shall be no "invasions" by the students of either
University of the campus of the cither, and that students participating
in such violations will be subject to severe discipline.'
(b) 'That each student body will undertake to educate its members
in the weeks preceding the "Big Game" to observe the spirit of the
foregoing resolution and to exercise every possible measure to pre
vent any incident arising that may lead to its violation.'

Perhaps you have the attitude that you will gain in campus distinc
tion by painting the Big "C." We remind you that your high school days
arc over. You are Stanford men now and are expected to conduct your
selves like men.
Painting the Big "C" or committing other acts of vandalism against
the Cal campus is not the way to promote good Stanford spirit.
