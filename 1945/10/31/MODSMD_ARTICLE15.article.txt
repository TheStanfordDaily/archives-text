# Historic ‘Battle for the Axe’ Symbolizes 54-Year Rivalry Between Stanford, California
## 'The Immortal 21' Regain Weapon After Long Possession By Berkeley; Now Is Traditional Big Game Trophy 
### 
Strangest thing about the Stan
ford Axe is that, while it is the
greatest symbol of the Cal-Stanford
rivalry, it. in itself did more than
any other thing to create that ri
valry; and the events surrounding
its origin and checkered history are
credited by some authorities with
having crystallized the spirit of
both Stanford and the University of
California.
Rivalry Began in '91
It all began back in '91 when
Stanford first opened its gates. Cal
had had no rivals for three decades,
and when the Palo Altans moved in
on the Peninsula, it was only natu
ral that she should look down her
regal nose at the upstarts. And it.
was only natural that Stanford
should be cocky and resent that su
perior attitude.
Axe Yell Introduced
Events rolled along nicely until
1899 with Stanford dropping only
one of the Cal-Stanford baseball se
ries and winning the first football
game played in 1892. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle for
athletic supremacy was on.

In 1896 Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for its still
superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy hit
the Farm. George Beckett, captain
of the baseball team and star pitch
er, died before the season started,
and Stanford lost the first game of
the series. It looked as though the
"any Stanford man is worth two Cal
men any time any place" theory was
in for a nasty set-back.
Cal Steals Axe
Desperately the students sought
a way to rebuild team spirit. Out
of this search came the Axe. At a
bonfire Frank English and Billy Erb
produced a huge ten-pound axe and
before a cheering crowd cut off the
head of a blue and gold effigy with
one blow.
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, but Stanford la.st the
game and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
of their men hadn't liked the Axe
and they were determined to take
down Stanford by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the Axe to Carl Hay
den and two companions. Tom Mc-
Faddcn, Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft, and
hoping for a chance to battle a few
Berkcleyites joined the other three,
dragging it warily down the street.
Six-llour Fight in San Francisco
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man group on the prize
and wailed. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours.
it was natural that their grips
should eventually break. Among the
Berkcleyites was a football player,
Paul Castlehun, who grabbed the
Axe and started running.
With a howling mob after him,
and unsure whether it was friend
or foe, Castlehun threw the Axe to
Fondini Bacigalupi, who, when he
became exhausted, relayed it to Bill
Drumm.
Police Conic to Aid
A Stanford hurdler in the mob,
named Stout, stuck with Drumm
who, also exhausted, unknowingly
handed the prize over to him. Stout
ran, and Stanford would have re
covered the Axe but for Jimmy
Hopper, Berkeley's wonder quarter
back, who brought Stout down with
a flying tackle and recovered the
weapon. The battle then turned into
a triumphal march.
In the meantime Hayden had
called the police, saying that a
crowd of Cal students had stolen a
valuable souvenir in the form of
an axe, and were making away with
it in a stolen horse and wagon. The
chief wanted a description of the
horse and wagon, but Hayden
howled back over the phone, '"To
hell with the horse and wagon. We
want the Axe!"
Fight Moves to Chinatown
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them when they

arrived in Chinatown was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton. He
dived into the mob and hollered for
the police but was completely over
whelmed. Then, as he says in a
letter written in 1930:
"I knew a couple of cops, and we
raced for the Ferry. We began ar
resting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested, and according to him
this is what happened. The gang
with the Axe found the Ferry build
ing quite crowded with Stanford
reinforcements and the police. Af
ter a brief conference it was de
cided that Cliff Miller, the only man
with an overcoat, should hide it.
Spying an unescorted coed, a nod
ding acquaintance of his, he offered
her his arm and sti'olled into the
building. The coed has remained
unidentified to this day. The Axe
was taken to Berkeley.
Attempts to Regain Axe
Over in Berkeley the first and
the wildest of 31 Axe rallies was
taking place. Twice a Stanford man
had the Axe in his hands during
the next two days. Both times
something intervened.
Then a raid was staged on the
Chi Psi house where Charlie Prin
gle, football captain and first cus
todian of the Axe, lived. The raid
ers tore the house apart but failed
to find the object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agi'eed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series.
Raid for Cal Fencc
Expelled on the eve of graduation

in '98, he did plan the famous Fence
raid and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipulated
that there would be no more Axe
raids, but had said nothing about
any other sort of raid. Irwin's idea
was to capture the most valuable
of Cal's trophies, the Senior Fence,
and hold it as hostage.
This he did, with 110 hitches, but
Cal chose to regard the raid as a
favor since the fence was an eye
sore, and the Axe continued to re
side in the vaults of the Berkeley
American Trust.
Cal Keeps Axe
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turned over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Cal began to feel
that the Axe was legally theirs.
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed.
"21" Plan Raid
On Thursday morning the ''21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the fourth
were right at the bank.
All but five of the men at the
i - ally edged their way to positions
close to the Axe during the cere
monies. Ten minutes before the
rally closed, the remaining five left
the theater to take up posts near
the armored car. These were the
fake cameramen, who delayed pro
ceedings so that other conspirators
could join the frosh guards.
As soon as the armored car pulled
away, the "cameramen" raced back
to the bank, where they again be
gan asking for pictures, so as to give
the remaining 21 a chance to get
into position.
Stanford Gets Axe
Norm Horner, Axe custodian, in
side the car, began to get restive.
Just as he stepped out onto the side

walk, an overcharged flash-bulb
was exploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
and passed it through several hands
to Loufbourow, who calmly tucked
it under his sweater, walked to the
camera car and drove away.
Just as the get-away car left, Ar
thur Miller dropped a tear gas
bomb. Another group headed by
Louis Ferrino blocked every en
trance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be elayed
to the rest of the campus.
Ruses Delay Cal Men
Then the rest of the men mixed
with the crowd and passed the world
to "go up to the Campanile and or
ganize a pursuit party to get the
Axe back from those
Stanford men." This second ruse
delayed matters materially and
gave the Axe car a chance to get
away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 in the
morning in their pajamas. The
crowd marched from the foot fo the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.
At the post office the fear of re
taliatory raids was expressed and
so the Axe was taken to Roble
where the women took it in for the
night.
Traditional Trophy
Newspapers all over the Country
carried stories of the famous "21"
raid. The Palo Alto American Trust
vaults held the Axe for two years,
and then, in 19.13, the colorful weap
on was put up as a perpetual Big
Game trophy.
Probably if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe be
came the burning symbol of the
two schools' rivalry — a rivalry
which has existed since 1891 with
only a three-year lapse.

ford Axe is that, while it is the

men any time any place" theory was
in for a nasty set-back.
Cal Steals Axe
Desperately the students sought
a way to rebuild team spirit. Out
of this search came the Axe. At a
bonfire Frank English and Billy Erb
produced a huge ten-pound axe and
before a cheering crowd cut off the
head of a blue and gold effigy with
one blow.
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, but Stanford la.st the
game and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
of their men hadn't liked the Axe
and they were determined to take
down Stanford by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the Axe to Carl Hay
den and two companions. Tom Mc-
Faddcn, Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft, and
hoping for a chance to battle a few
Berkcleyites joined the other three,
dragging it warily down the street.
Six-llour Fight in San Francisco
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man group on the prize
and wailed. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours.
it was natural that their grips
should eventually break. Among the
Berkcleyites was a football player,
Paul Castlehun, who grabbed the
Axe and started running.
With a howling mob after him,
and unsure whether it was friend
or foe, Castlehun threw the Axe to
Fondini Bacigalupi, who, when he
became exhausted, relayed it to Bill
Drumm.
Police Conic to Aid
A Stanford hurdler in the mob,
named Stout, stuck with Drumm
who, also exhausted, unknowingly
handed the prize over to him. Stout
ran, and Stanford would have re
covered the Axe but for Jimmy
Hopper, Berkeley's wonder quarter
back, who brought Stout down with
a flying tackle and recovered the
weapon. The battle then turned into
a triumphal march.
In the meantime Hayden had
called the police, saying that a
crowd of Cal students had stolen a
valuable souvenir in the form of
an axe, and were making away with
it in a stolen horse and wagon. The
chief wanted a description of the
horse and wagon, but Hayden
howled back over the phone, '"To
hell with the horse and wagon. We
want the Axe!"
Fight Moves to Chinatown
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them when they

arrived in Chinatown was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton. He
dived into the mob and hollered for
the police but was completely over
whelmed. Then, as he says in a
letter written in 1930:
"I knew a couple of cops, and we
raced for the Ferry. We began ar
resting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested, and according to him
this is what happened. The gang
with the Axe found the Ferry build
ing quite crowded with Stanford
reinforcements and the police. Af
ter a brief conference it was de
cided that Cliff Miller, the only man
with an overcoat, should hide it.
Spying an unescorted coed, a nod
ding acquaintance of his, he offered
her his arm and sti'olled into the
building. The coed has remained
unidentified to this day. The Axe
was taken to Berkeley.
Attempts to Regain Axe
Over in Berkeley the first and
the wildest of 31 Axe rallies was
taking place. Twice a Stanford man
had the Axe in his hands during
the next two days. Both times
something intervened.
Then a raid was staged on the
Chi Psi house where Charlie Prin
gle, football captain and first cus
todian of the Axe, lived. The raid
ers tore the house apart but failed
to find the object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agi'eed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series.
Raid for Cal Fencc
Expelled on the eve of graduation

in '98, he did plan the famous Fence
raid and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipulated
that there would be no more Axe
raids, but had said nothing about
any other sort of raid. Irwin's idea
was to capture the most valuable
of Cal's trophies, the Senior Fence,
and hold it as hostage.
This he did, with 110 hitches, but
Cal chose to regard the raid as a
favor since the fence was an eye
sore, and the Axe continued to re
side in the vaults of the Berkeley
American Trust.
Cal Keeps Axe
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turned over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Cal began to feel
that the Axe was legally theirs.
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed.
"21" Plan Raid
On Thursday morning the ''21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the fourth
were right at the bank.
All but five of the men at the
i - ally edged their way to positions
close to the Axe during the cere
monies. Ten minutes before the
rally closed, the remaining five left
the theater to take up posts near
the armored car. These were the
fake cameramen, who delayed pro
ceedings so that other conspirators
could join the frosh guards.
As soon as the armored car pulled
away, the "cameramen" raced back
to the bank, where they again be
gan asking for pictures, so as to give
the remaining 21 a chance to get
into position.
Stanford Gets Axe
Norm Horner, Axe custodian, in
side the car, began to get restive.
Just as he stepped out onto the side

walk, an overcharged flash-bulb
was exploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
and passed it through several hands
to Loufbourow, who calmly tucked
it under his sweater, walked to the
camera car and drove away.
Just as the get-away car left, Ar
thur Miller dropped a tear gas
bomb. Another group headed by
Louis Ferrino blocked every en
trance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be elayed
to the rest of the campus.
Ruses Delay Cal Men
Then the rest of the men mixed
with the crowd and passed the world
to "go up to the Campanile and or
ganize a pursuit party to get the
Axe back from those
Stanford men." This second ruse
delayed matters materially and
gave the Axe car a chance to get
away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 in the
morning in their pajamas. The
crowd marched from the foot fo the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.
At the post office the fear of re
taliatory raids was expressed and
so the Axe was taken to Roble
where the women took it in for the
night.
Traditional Trophy
Newspapers all over the Country
carried stories of the famous "21"
raid. The Palo Alto American Trust
vaults held the Axe for two years,
and then, in 19.13, the colorful weap
on was put up as a perpetual Big
Game trophy.
Probably if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe be
came the burning symbol of the
two schools' rivalry — a rivalry
which has existed since 1891 with
only a three-year lapse.

Strangest thing about the Stan
ford Axe is that, while it is the
greatest symbol of the Cal-Stanford
rivalry, it. in itself did more than
any other thing to create that ri
valry; and the events surrounding
its origin and checkered history are
credited by some authorities with
having crystallized the spirit of
both Stanford and the University of
California.
Rivalry Began in '91
It all began back in '91 when
Stanford first opened its gates. Cal
had had no rivals for three decades,
and when the Palo Altans moved in
on the Peninsula, it was only natu
ral that she should look down her
regal nose at the upstarts. And it.
was only natural that Stanford
should be cocky and resent that su
perior attitude.
Axe Yell Introduced
Events rolled along nicely until
1899 with Stanford dropping only
one of the Cal-Stanford baseball se
ries and winning the first football
game played in 1892. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle for
athletic supremacy was on.

In 1896 Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for its still
superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy hit
the Farm. George Beckett, captain
of the baseball team and star pitch
er, died before the season started,
and Stanford lost the first game of
the series. It looked as though the
"any Stanford man is worth two Cal
men any time any place" theory was
in for a nasty set-back.

became exhausted, relayed it to Bill
Drumm.
Police Conic to Aid
A Stanford hurdler in the mob,
named Stout, stuck with Drumm
who, also exhausted, unknowingly
handed the prize over to him. Stout
ran, and Stanford would have re
covered the Axe but for Jimmy
Hopper, Berkeley's wonder quarter
back, who brought Stout down with
a flying tackle and recovered the
weapon. The battle then turned into
a triumphal march.
In the meantime Hayden had
called the police, saying that a
crowd of Cal students had stolen a
valuable souvenir in the form of
an axe, and were making away with
it in a stolen horse and wagon. The
chief wanted a description of the
horse and wagon, but Hayden
howled back over the phone, '"To
hell with the horse and wagon. We
want the Axe!"
Fight Moves to Chinatown
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them when they

arrived in Chinatown was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton. He
dived into the mob and hollered for
the police but was completely over
whelmed. Then, as he says in a
letter written in 1930:
"I knew a couple of cops, and we
raced for the Ferry. We began ar
resting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested, and according to him
this is what happened. The gang
with the Axe found the Ferry build
ing quite crowded with Stanford
reinforcements and the police. Af
ter a brief conference it was de
cided that Cliff Miller, the only man
with an overcoat, should hide it.
Spying an unescorted coed, a nod
ding acquaintance of his, he offered
her his arm and sti'olled into the
building. The coed has remained
unidentified to this day. The Axe
was taken to Berkeley.
Attempts to Regain Axe
Over in Berkeley the first and
the wildest of 31 Axe rallies was
taking place. Twice a Stanford man
had the Axe in his hands during
the next two days. Both times
something intervened.
Then a raid was staged on the
Chi Psi house where Charlie Prin
gle, football captain and first cus
todian of the Axe, lived. The raid
ers tore the house apart but failed
to find the object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agi'eed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series.
Raid for Cal Fencc
Expelled on the eve of graduation

in '98, he did plan the famous Fence
raid and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipulated
that there would be no more Axe
raids, but had said nothing about
any other sort of raid. Irwin's idea
was to capture the most valuable
of Cal's trophies, the Senior Fence,
and hold it as hostage.
This he did, with 110 hitches, but
Cal chose to regard the raid as a
favor since the fence was an eye
sore, and the Axe continued to re
side in the vaults of the Berkeley
American Trust.
Cal Keeps Axe
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turned over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Cal began to feel
that the Axe was legally theirs.
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed.
"21" Plan Raid
On Thursday morning the ''21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the fourth
were right at the bank.
All but five of the men at the
i - ally edged their way to positions
close to the Axe during the cere
monies. Ten minutes before the
rally closed, the remaining five left
the theater to take up posts near
the armored car. These were the
fake cameramen, who delayed pro
ceedings so that other conspirators
could join the frosh guards.
As soon as the armored car pulled
away, the "cameramen" raced back
to the bank, where they again be
gan asking for pictures, so as to give
the remaining 21 a chance to get
into position.
Stanford Gets Axe
Norm Horner, Axe custodian, in
side the car, began to get restive.
Just as he stepped out onto the side

walk, an overcharged flash-bulb
was exploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
and passed it through several hands
to Loufbourow, who calmly tucked
it under his sweater, walked to the
camera car and drove away.
Just as the get-away car left, Ar
thur Miller dropped a tear gas
bomb. Another group headed by
Louis Ferrino blocked every en
trance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be elayed
to the rest of the campus.
Ruses Delay Cal Men
Then the rest of the men mixed
with the crowd and passed the world
to "go up to the Campanile and or
ganize a pursuit party to get the
Axe back from those
Stanford men." This second ruse
delayed matters materially and
gave the Axe car a chance to get
away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 in the
morning in their pajamas. The
crowd marched from the foot fo the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.
At the post office the fear of re
taliatory raids was expressed and
so the Axe was taken to Roble
where the women took it in for the
night.
Traditional Trophy
Newspapers all over the Country
carried stories of the famous "21"
raid. The Palo Alto American Trust
vaults held the Axe for two years,
and then, in 19.13, the colorful weap
on was put up as a perpetual Big
Game trophy.
Probably if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe be
came the burning symbol of the
two schools' rivalry — a rivalry
which has existed since 1891 with
only a three-year lapse.

Strangest thing about the Stan
ford Axe is that, while it is the
greatest symbol of the Cal-Stanford
rivalry, it. in itself did more than
any other thing to create that ri
valry; and the events surrounding
its origin and checkered history are
credited by some authorities with
having crystallized the spirit of
both Stanford and the University of
California.
Rivalry Began in '91
It all began back in '91 when
Stanford first opened its gates. Cal
had had no rivals for three decades,
and when the Palo Altans moved in
on the Peninsula, it was only natu
ral that she should look down her
regal nose at the upstarts. And it.
was only natural that Stanford
should be cocky and resent that su
perior attitude.
Axe Yell Introduced
Events rolled along nicely until
1899 with Stanford dropping only
one of the Cal-Stanford baseball se
ries and winning the first football
game played in 1892. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle for
athletic supremacy was on.

In 1896 Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for its still
superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy hit
the Farm. George Beckett, captain
of the baseball team and star pitch
er, died before the season started,
and Stanford lost the first game of
the series. It looked as though the
"any Stanford man is worth two Cal
men any time any place" theory was
in for a nasty set-back.
Cal Steals Axe
Desperately the students sought
a way to rebuild team spirit. Out
of this search came the Axe. At a
bonfire Frank English and Billy Erb
produced a huge ten-pound axe and
before a cheering crowd cut off the
head of a blue and gold effigy with
one blow.
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, but Stanford la.st the
game and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
of their men hadn't liked the Axe
and they were determined to take
down Stanford by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the Axe to Carl Hay
den and two companions. Tom Mc-
Faddcn, Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft, and
hoping for a chance to battle a few
Berkcleyites joined the other three,
dragging it warily down the street.
Six-llour Fight in San Francisco
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man group on the prize
and wailed. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours.
it was natural that their grips
should eventually break. Among the
Berkcleyites was a football player,
Paul Castlehun, who grabbed the
Axe and started running.
With a howling mob after him,
and unsure whether it was friend
or foe, Castlehun threw the Axe to
Fondini Bacigalupi, who, when he
became exhausted, relayed it to Bill
Drumm.

A Stanford hurdler in the mob,

reinforcements and the police. Af
ter a brief conference it was de
cided that Cliff Miller, the only man
with an overcoat, should hide it.
Spying an unescorted coed, a nod
ding acquaintance of his, he offered
her his arm and sti'olled into the
building. The coed has remained
unidentified to this day. The Axe
was taken to Berkeley.
Attempts to Regain Axe
Over in Berkeley the first and
the wildest of 31 Axe rallies was
taking place. Twice a Stanford man
had the Axe in his hands during
the next two days. Both times
something intervened.
Then a raid was staged on the
Chi Psi house where Charlie Prin
gle, football captain and first cus
todian of the Axe, lived. The raid
ers tore the house apart but failed
to find the object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agi'eed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series.
Raid for Cal Fencc
Expelled on the eve of graduation

in '98, he did plan the famous Fence
raid and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipulated
that there would be no more Axe
raids, but had said nothing about
any other sort of raid. Irwin's idea
was to capture the most valuable
of Cal's trophies, the Senior Fence,
and hold it as hostage.
This he did, with 110 hitches, but
Cal chose to regard the raid as a
favor since the fence was an eye
sore, and the Axe continued to re
side in the vaults of the Berkeley
American Trust.
Cal Keeps Axe
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turned over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Cal began to feel
that the Axe was legally theirs.
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed.
"21" Plan Raid
On Thursday morning the ''21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the fourth
were right at the bank.
All but five of the men at the
i - ally edged their way to positions
close to the Axe during the cere
monies. Ten minutes before the
rally closed, the remaining five left
the theater to take up posts near
the armored car. These were the
fake cameramen, who delayed pro
ceedings so that other conspirators
could join the frosh guards.
As soon as the armored car pulled
away, the "cameramen" raced back
to the bank, where they again be
gan asking for pictures, so as to give
the remaining 21 a chance to get
into position.
Stanford Gets Axe
Norm Horner, Axe custodian, in
side the car, began to get restive.
Just as he stepped out onto the side

walk, an overcharged flash-bulb
was exploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
and passed it through several hands
to Loufbourow, who calmly tucked
it under his sweater, walked to the
camera car and drove away.
Just as the get-away car left, Ar
thur Miller dropped a tear gas
bomb. Another group headed by
Louis Ferrino blocked every en
trance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be elayed
to the rest of the campus.
Ruses Delay Cal Men
Then the rest of the men mixed
with the crowd and passed the world
to "go up to the Campanile and or
ganize a pursuit party to get the
Axe back from those
Stanford men." This second ruse
delayed matters materially and
gave the Axe car a chance to get
away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 in the
morning in their pajamas. The
crowd marched from the foot fo the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.
At the post office the fear of re
taliatory raids was expressed and
so the Axe was taken to Roble
where the women took it in for the
night.
Traditional Trophy
Newspapers all over the Country
carried stories of the famous "21"
raid. The Palo Alto American Trust
vaults held the Axe for two years,
and then, in 19.13, the colorful weap
on was put up as a perpetual Big
Game trophy.
Probably if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe be
came the burning symbol of the
two schools' rivalry — a rivalry
which has existed since 1891 with
only a three-year lapse.

Strangest thing about the Stan
ford Axe is that, while it is the
greatest symbol of the Cal-Stanford
rivalry, it. in itself did more than
any other thing to create that ri
valry; and the events surrounding
its origin and checkered history are
credited by some authorities with
having crystallized the spirit of
both Stanford and the University of
California.
Rivalry Began in '91
It all began back in '91 when
Stanford first opened its gates. Cal
had had no rivals for three decades,
and when the Palo Altans moved in
on the Peninsula, it was only natu
ral that she should look down her
regal nose at the upstarts. And it.
was only natural that Stanford
should be cocky and resent that su
perior attitude.
Axe Yell Introduced
Events rolled along nicely until
1899 with Stanford dropping only
one of the Cal-Stanford baseball se
ries and winning the first football
game played in 1892. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle for
athletic supremacy was on.

In 1896 Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for its still
superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy hit
the Farm. George Beckett, captain
of the baseball team and star pitch
er, died before the season started,
and Stanford lost the first game of
the series. It looked as though the
"any Stanford man is worth two Cal
men any time any place" theory was
in for a nasty set-back.
Cal Steals Axe
Desperately the students sought
a way to rebuild team spirit. Out
of this search came the Axe. At a
bonfire Frank English and Billy Erb
produced a huge ten-pound axe and
before a cheering crowd cut off the
head of a blue and gold effigy with
one blow.
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, but Stanford la.st the
game and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
of their men hadn't liked the Axe
and they were determined to take
down Stanford by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the Axe to Carl Hay
den and two companions. Tom Mc-
Faddcn, Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft, and
hoping for a chance to battle a few
Berkcleyites joined the other three,
dragging it warily down the street.
Six-llour Fight in San Francisco
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man group on the prize
and wailed. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours.
it was natural that their grips
should eventually break. Among the
Berkcleyites was a football player,
Paul Castlehun, who grabbed the
Axe and started running.
With a howling mob after him,
and unsure whether it was friend
or foe, Castlehun threw the Axe to
Fondini Bacigalupi, who, when he
became exhausted, relayed it to Bill
Drumm.
Police Conic to Aid
A Stanford hurdler in the mob,
named Stout, stuck with Drumm
who, also exhausted, unknowingly
handed the prize over to him. Stout
ran, and Stanford would have re
covered the Axe but for Jimmy
Hopper, Berkeley's wonder quarter
back, who brought Stout down with
a flying tackle and recovered the
weapon. The battle then turned into
a triumphal march.
In the meantime Hayden had
called the police, saying that a
crowd of Cal students had stolen a
valuable souvenir in the form of
an axe, and were making away with
it in a stolen horse and wagon. The
chief wanted a description of the
horse and wagon, but Hayden
howled back over the phone, '"To
hell with the horse and wagon. We
want the Axe!"
Fight Moves to Chinatown
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them when they

arrived in Chinatown was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton. He
dived into the mob and hollered for
the police but was completely over
whelmed. Then, as he says in a
letter written in 1930:
"I knew a couple of cops, and we
raced for the Ferry. We began ar
resting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested, and according to him
this is what happened. The gang
with the Axe found the Ferry build
ing quite crowded with Stanford
reinforcements and the police. Af
ter a brief conference it was de
cided that Cliff Miller, the only man
with an overcoat, should hide it.
Spying an unescorted coed, a nod

Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turned over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Cal began to feel
that the Axe was legally theirs.
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed.
"21" Plan Raid
On Thursday morning the ''21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the fourth
were right at the bank.
All but five of the men at the
i - ally edged their way to positions
close to the Axe during the cere
monies. Ten minutes before the
rally closed, the remaining five left
the theater to take up posts near
the armored car. These were the
fake cameramen, who delayed pro
ceedings so that other conspirators
could join the frosh guards.
As soon as the armored car pulled
away, the "cameramen" raced back
to the bank, where they again be
gan asking for pictures, so as to give
the remaining 21 a chance to get
into position.
Stanford Gets Axe
Norm Horner, Axe custodian, in
side the car, began to get restive.
Just as he stepped out onto the side

walk, an overcharged flash-bulb
was exploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
and passed it through several hands
to Loufbourow, who calmly tucked
it under his sweater, walked to the
camera car and drove away.
Just as the get-away car left, Ar
thur Miller dropped a tear gas
bomb. Another group headed by
Louis Ferrino blocked every en
trance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be elayed
to the rest of the campus.
Ruses Delay Cal Men
Then the rest of the men mixed
with the crowd and passed the world
to "go up to the Campanile and or
ganize a pursuit party to get the
Axe back from those
Stanford men." This second ruse
delayed matters materially and
gave the Axe car a chance to get
away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 in the
morning in their pajamas. The
crowd marched from the foot fo the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.
At the post office the fear of re
taliatory raids was expressed and
so the Axe was taken to Roble
where the women took it in for the
night.
Traditional Trophy
Newspapers all over the Country
carried stories of the famous "21"
raid. The Palo Alto American Trust
vaults held the Axe for two years,
and then, in 19.13, the colorful weap
on was put up as a perpetual Big
Game trophy.
Probably if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe be
came the burning symbol of the
two schools' rivalry — a rivalry
which has existed since 1891 with
only a three-year lapse.

Strangest thing about the Stan
ford Axe is that, while it is the
greatest symbol of the Cal-Stanford
rivalry, it. in itself did more than
any other thing to create that ri
valry; and the events surrounding
its origin and checkered history are
credited by some authorities with
having crystallized the spirit of
both Stanford and the University of
California.
Rivalry Began in '91
It all began back in '91 when
Stanford first opened its gates. Cal
had had no rivals for three decades,
and when the Palo Altans moved in
on the Peninsula, it was only natu
ral that she should look down her
regal nose at the upstarts. And it.
was only natural that Stanford
should be cocky and resent that su
perior attitude.
Axe Yell Introduced
Events rolled along nicely until
1899 with Stanford dropping only
one of the Cal-Stanford baseball se
ries and winning the first football
game played in 1892. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle for
athletic supremacy was on.

In 1896 Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for its still
superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy hit
the Farm. George Beckett, captain
of the baseball team and star pitch
er, died before the season started,
and Stanford lost the first game of
the series. It looked as though the
"any Stanford man is worth two Cal
men any time any place" theory was
in for a nasty set-back.
Cal Steals Axe
Desperately the students sought
a way to rebuild team spirit. Out
of this search came the Axe. At a
bonfire Frank English and Billy Erb
produced a huge ten-pound axe and
before a cheering crowd cut off the

Desperately the students sought
a way to rebuild team spirit. Out
of this search came the Axe. At a
bonfire Frank English and Billy Erb
produced a huge ten-pound axe and
before a cheering crowd cut off the
head of a blue and gold effigy with
one blow.
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, but Stanford la.st the
game and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
of their men hadn't liked the Axe
and they were determined to take
down Stanford by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the Axe to Carl Hay
den and two companions. Tom Mc-
Faddcn, Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft, and
hoping for a chance to battle a few
Berkcleyites joined the other three,
dragging it warily down the street.
Six-llour Fight in San Francisco
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man group on the prize
and wailed. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours.
it was natural that their grips
should eventually break. Among the
Berkcleyites was a football player,
Paul Castlehun, who grabbed the
Axe and started running.
With a howling mob after him,
and unsure whether it was friend
or foe, Castlehun threw the Axe to
Fondini Bacigalupi, who, when he
became exhausted, relayed it to Bill
Drumm.
Police Conic to Aid
A Stanford hurdler in the mob,
named Stout, stuck with Drumm
who, also exhausted, unknowingly
handed the prize over to him. Stout
ran, and Stanford would have re
covered the Axe but for Jimmy
Hopper, Berkeley's wonder quarter
back, who brought Stout down with
a flying tackle and recovered the
weapon. The battle then turned into
a triumphal march.
In the meantime Hayden had
called the police, saying that a
crowd of Cal students had stolen a
valuable souvenir in the form of
an axe, and were making away with
it in a stolen horse and wagon. The
chief wanted a description of the
horse and wagon, but Hayden
howled back over the phone, '"To
hell with the horse and wagon. We
want the Axe!"
Fight Moves to Chinatown
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them when they

arrived in Chinatown was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton. He
dived into the mob and hollered for
the police but was completely over
whelmed. Then, as he says in a
letter written in 1930:
"I knew a couple of cops, and we
raced for the Ferry. We began ar
resting suspicious characters till
we had quite a huddle. But we
found no Axe. It was getting late
so the cops decided to call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested, and according to him
this is what happened. The gang
with the Axe found the Ferry build
ing quite crowded with Stanford
reinforcements and the police. Af
ter a brief conference it was de
cided that Cliff Miller, the only man
with an overcoat, should hide it.
Spying an unescorted coed, a nod
ding acquaintance of his, he offered
her his arm and sti'olled into the
building. The coed has remained
unidentified to this day. The Axe
was taken to Berkeley.
Attempts to Regain Axe
Over in Berkeley the first and
the wildest of 31 Axe rallies was
taking place. Twice a Stanford man
had the Axe in his hands during
the next two days. Both times
something intervened.
Then a raid was staged on the
Chi Psi house where Charlie Prin
gle, football captain and first cus
todian of the Axe, lived. The raid
ers tore the house apart but failed
to find the object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agi'eed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series.
Raid for Cal Fencc
Expelled on the eve of graduation

in '98, he did plan the famous Fence
raid and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipulated
that there would be no more Axe
raids, but had said nothing about
any other sort of raid. Irwin's idea
was to capture the most valuable
of Cal's trophies, the Senior Fence,
and hold it as hostage.
This he did, with 110 hitches, but
Cal chose to regard the raid as a
favor since the fence was an eye
sore, and the Axe continued to re

American Trust.

was exploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
and passed it through several hands
to Loufbourow, who calmly tucked
it under his sweater, walked to the
camera car and drove away.
Just as the get-away car left, Ar
thur Miller dropped a tear gas
bomb. Another group headed by
Louis Ferrino blocked every en
trance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be elayed
to the rest of the campus.
Ruses Delay Cal Men
Then the rest of the men mixed
with the crowd and passed the world
to "go up to the Campanile and or
ganize a pursuit party to get the
Axe back from those
Stanford men." This second ruse
delayed matters materially and
gave the Axe car a chance to get
away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 in the
morning in their pajamas. The
crowd marched from the foot fo the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.
At the post office the fear of re
taliatory raids was expressed and
so the Axe was taken to Roble
where the women took it in for the
night.
Traditional Trophy
Newspapers all over the Country
carried stories of the famous "21"
raid. The Palo Alto American Trust
vaults held the Axe for two years,
and then, in 19.13, the colorful weap
on was put up as a perpetual Big
Game trophy.
Probably if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe be
came the burning symbol of the
two schools' rivalry — a rivalry
which has existed since 1891 with
only a three-year lapse.
