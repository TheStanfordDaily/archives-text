Davies urges sophomores to
make up their groups before Fri
day night so that the hunt will
start without a loss of time. Stu
dents may, however, wait until the
meeting at the Nitery to get the
groups together.
Bob Stephens, president of the
Sophomore Class, will preside at
the meeting which will precede the
Scavenger Hunt. The meeting,
which will begin at 7:30 in the
Nitery, is planned to inform all
sophomores of class activities set for
the coming year. After the busi
ness of the meeting and the pre
sentation of the soph excom, the
hunt will get underway.
Most Articles on Campus
Most of the articles required of
the scavengers can be obtained in
the halls on campus. There is one
article, however, that can only be
found away from Stanford. Al
though a car is not necessary for
the hunt, it will aid the scavengers
in finding this one article.
Soph Excom is keeping the list
for the hunt a deep secret. The
hopeful scavengers will not learn
their grim job until Friday night.
