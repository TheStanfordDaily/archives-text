# Madrigal Group ‘Unusual'
## 
### 
A carefully created Elizabethan
atmosphere, and casual-seeming
but well-executed performances
made the concert of 16th and 17th
century chamber music presented
by the Madrigal Guild last night
an unusual and gratifying eve
ning in the Tuesday Scries.
Among the loveliest of the Mad
rigals sung by the group of ten Bay
Area artists was "II Bianco e Dolce
Cigno," in Italian by Arcadelt,
written in 1539.
Also particularly haunting in tone
was a court song, "Whereto Should
I Express," by Henry VIII, sung in
solo by Frances Branch Higgins,
contralto, with flute, by Christine
Howells Pfund, and lute by Eileen
Washington.
The singers wore colorful Eliza
bethan costumes, the women
dressed in long full skirts, with
low necks and headpieces, and the
men in satin doublets. Their
casual grouping around a period
table or the harpsichord main
tained the intimate setting of a
social gathering in the Elizabeth
ail England home.
Their best received performances
were a lilting air with harpsichord
"Willy, Prithc Go to Bed," by Rav
enseroft; a 17th century German
lullaby, "Sunshine and Rainclouds,"
and the closing selection "Down in
Yon Forest," in which a medieval
troubadour tells a legend of the
keepers of the Holy Grail.
A skillful instrumental perform
ance of Lully's "Suite for Flute and
Harpsichord" by Christine Pfund
and Mrs. Washington was also well
received by the audience.
The selection to which the au
dience was most responsive was
the familiar "It Was a Lover and
His Lass" by Morlcy. sung by Vir
ginia and Ellsworth Walston. The
couple sung it with animation and
skill.
An Aria from "Orfeo" by Mon
teverdi, "Tu Sei Morta," sung by
Lawrence Shcrrill, bass-baritone,
with harpsichord, was perhaps
the outstanding individual per
formance of the evening. He sang
the moving passage in which
Orpheus resolves to go to Ilades,
with well restrained feeling.
Among the other selections pre
sented, the madrigals: "Welcome
Sweet Pleasure," by Weelkes; '"Weep,
O Mine Eyes" by Bennct; "Sweet
Suffolk Owl," and "All Creatures
Now are Merry-Minded," by Ben
net displayed the excellent en
semble musicianship of the group.
"Lasciatemi Morire," another Ital
ian madrigal, brought forth partic
ularly the quality of the male voices.
Another familiar song was Dow
land's "Weep You No More San
Fountains," sung by Allison Ral
ston, mezzo-soprano, solo for the
first stanza and with the group
in the second.
The Guild was presented by the
Committee on Public Exercises
through the efforts of the Friends
of Music of Stanford.—Pinkerton.

century chamber music presented
by the Madrigal Guild last night
an unusual and gratifying eve
ning in the Tuesday Scries.
Among the loveliest of the Mad
rigals sung by the group of ten Bay
Area artists was "II Bianco e Dolce
Cigno," in Italian by Arcadelt,
written in 1539.
Also particularly haunting in tone
was a court song, "Whereto Should
I Express," by Henry VIII, sung in
solo by Frances Branch Higgins,
contralto, with flute, by Christine
Howells Pfund, and lute by Eileen
Washington.
The singers wore colorful Eliza
bethan costumes, the women
dressed in long full skirts, with
low necks and headpieces, and the
men in satin doublets. Their
casual grouping around a period
table or the harpsichord main
tained the intimate setting of a
social gathering in the Elizabeth
ail England home.
Their best received performances
were a lilting air with harpsichord
"Willy, Prithc Go to Bed," by Rav
enseroft; a 17th century German
lullaby, "Sunshine and Rainclouds,"
and the closing selection "Down in
Yon Forest," in which a medieval
troubadour tells a legend of the
keepers of the Holy Grail.
A skillful instrumental perform
ance of Lully's "Suite for Flute and
Harpsichord" by Christine Pfund
and Mrs. Washington was also well
received by the audience.
The selection to which the au
dience was most responsive was
the familiar "It Was a Lover and
His Lass" by Morlcy. sung by Vir
ginia and Ellsworth Walston. The
couple sung it with animation and
skill.
An Aria from "Orfeo" by Mon
teverdi, "Tu Sei Morta," sung by
Lawrence Shcrrill, bass-baritone,
with harpsichord, was perhaps
the outstanding individual per
formance of the evening. He sang
the moving passage in which
Orpheus resolves to go to Ilades,
with well restrained feeling.
Among the other selections pre
sented, the madrigals: "Welcome
Sweet Pleasure," by Weelkes; '"Weep,
O Mine Eyes" by Bennct; "Sweet
Suffolk Owl," and "All Creatures
Now are Merry-Minded," by Ben
net displayed the excellent en
semble musicianship of the group.
"Lasciatemi Morire," another Ital
ian madrigal, brought forth partic
ularly the quality of the male voices.
Another familiar song was Dow
land's "Weep You No More San
Fountains," sung by Allison Ral
ston, mezzo-soprano, solo for the
first stanza and with the group
in the second.
The Guild was presented by the
Committee on Public Exercises
through the efforts of the Friends
of Music of Stanford.—Pinkerton.
A carefully created Elizabethan
atmosphere, and casual-seeming
but well-executed performances
made the concert of 16th and 17th
century chamber music presented
by the Madrigal Guild last night
an unusual and gratifying eve
ning in the Tuesday Scries.
