# Halloween Candles Hazard Says Chief
## 
### 
John Marston, chief of the Stan
ford Fire Department, warns all
students against the use of lighted
candles this Hallowe'en because of
the danger of fire.
"Fires have started in the past
through the use of lighted candles
and we wish to avoid such occur
ences this Hallowe'en," stated Chief
Marston.
Although there is a University
regulation against using fire in stu
dents' rooms, candles may be em
ployed in pumpkins if they are
supervised and free from any in
flammable material.
"We only wish the cooperation
of the students so that everyone can
have a happy but safe Hallowe'en,"
Marston said.
