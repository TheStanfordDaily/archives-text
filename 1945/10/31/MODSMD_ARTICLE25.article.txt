TRADITIONS-THE STANFORD
HERITAGE
Traditions, unless they add something to the
way of life of students of a university, and un
lethey are the sincere expression of those
students' wishes, are worthless.
That's why, as Cardinals starts its "Know
Stanford Traditions" campaign, we'd like to
say a few words about the intangible traditions
thai make Stanford what it is. These traditions
aren't simply maxims, like "No smoking on
Quad" or "No public initiations or class fights."
They are also concepts and ideals, attitudes and
habits of thought, that have distinguished
Stanford students and their university from
other students in other universities.
Stanford's location on the Pacific Coast has
been (he basis for what is perhaps its most
important asset — spaciousness — leading to a
freedom in thinking and living, together with
an odult sense of responsibility to the Univer
sity, that marks members of the "Stanford
Family."
Much of that freedom and responsibility has
shown itself in the growth of student govern
ment and perpetuation of the Honor System.
Many of the traditions Cardinals will attempt
to make known originated out of a respect for
the rights of the individual, and a spirit of tol
erance and friendliness among students and
faculty—this spirit, in itself, being a part of
the Stanford tradition.
Stanford students are free to accept or re
ject traditions as they see fit. As Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor of the University,
stated in his Founders' Day address last year,
"lust to do things the way they have been done
never has interested me, nor has it interested
the very high percentage of those who come
to Stanford. But when good ways to do things
have been discovered and fit appropriately into
the life of Stanford, then a defense of them so
that they may be given continuous trial through
out the years has always seemed to me to be
in order."
