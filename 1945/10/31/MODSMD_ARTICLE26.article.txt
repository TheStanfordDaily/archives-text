There has been a lot of discussion about
campus, fostered by some of the new fellows,
regarding the proper approach in securing a
date with different Stanford women, and how
to succeed in a romantic campaign. It is time
this situation is cleared up.
Now you must realize that anything I may
say from here on is from observation and
advice from others. It is not from personal
experience, because as everyone knows I don't
go out with girls.
The first type of Stanford woman we will

consider will be the ultra-ultra suave sophisti
cate. This type of woman must be handled
in a very cagey manner or the chips are
against you at the outset.
First comes the casual "Hello, there" on
campus. This must not be a boisterous or very
friendly greeting. It must be murmured al
most inaudibly and in a don't-caritis fashion.
This shows the prospective date that you are
above the cliche, hubba-hubba, boorish ap
proach.
Next comes the phone call. Now this must
be planned in advance. You must first gargle
with a good portion of Listerine so your vocal
cords will be in top condition and a good Orson
Welles type of speech may be secured. That
low masculine guality will make a great im
pression. Also, practice being a little blase in
your tone.
After you have talked with the prospective
date for a few minutes on chit-chatty, over-the
cocktail sort of conversation, it is time to spring
the date guestion. This type of girl cannot be
taken to a fireside, a campus dance, or out for
a beer. She just isn't the type. So you casu
ally say something about, "How about running
up to the City one of these nights?" You know,
as if you do it every other night.
She undoubtedly will see her way clear to
make the date, so as you hang up the phone,
you yawn something about, "I'll pick you up
at 7:30 and maybe we can hit a hotel for danc
ing." Act bored by it all. This goes over big.
But now is the time to really go into action.
First you race to get reservations at the best
table at the St. Francis, borrow the best-looking
car in the house and arrange for about three
good-sized orchids to be sent the night of the
date. Just as if you do it all the time. There's
the date and the procedure. By all means act
bored by it all.
The next type of Stanford woman is of the
rugged, gaggy variety. When this type of
woman comes to the phone you must scream
loudly, "Hya, sport, whatcha doin'?" This
shows her you're a real good, earthy guy.
Then you talk about so much nonsense and
make her giggle as much as possible. If she
says something about, "Oh, you're so clever,"
you're in. You might memorize some old Chap
pie jokes just for an insurance.
Another thing: Whenever you see the girl's
roommate you rush up to her and say, "You
know, you're so attractive, I really don't know
whether I should take out your roommate or
you." This puts you in solid with the roomie.
That's very important in this case.
For a date you must start in the afternoon
with horseback riding. After that come three
sets of tennis and maybe you could invite her
into a touch football game with some of the
fellows. This type is rugged and likes to be
able to show her stuff. At night you polish off
the day's activities with a couple of hours'
bowling. Admitted, this will wear you down
to the ankles, but it's the only way to meet the
situation with any success at all.
The other type of woman is the intellectual.
She's the one who is plus twice her units in
the Bawlout—and she doesn't mind telling you
at least a dozen times during the course of the
evening.
The best way to initiate a friendship in this
league is to drop over to her living group some
evening and discuss some common problem
relating to your studies. Of course this may
mean boning up on the subject for several
hours before the visit, but it's worth it.
On the date you must be sure to have some
ready information of world-wide importance
to offer. Nothing giddy in this type of woman.
She's the career variety, and you must be sure
to let her know that she won't fail in her en
deavors. She already is convinced of the fact,
but it makes her feel good to hear it from you
anythow.
Another point: never disagree with her. The
extent of your conversation could very well
be, "That's right, you're so right, and yes sir!"
You must show definite enthusiasm regarding
her intelligence.
As for a place to go, be sure and pick a nice
guiet spot where you can talk—or rather where
she can talk. Once in a while hit the opera
or the symphony, but be sure and brief your
self on the background of the thing first, and
by all means know the conductor's first name,
where he was born, his mother's maiden name
and how many gold teeth he has. This will
make you seem to be an intimate acquaintance
of the gent's.
Now there's the background, the technique
and the procedure. If this fails, there's always
Paly High.

There has been a lot of discussion about
campus, fostered by some of the new fellows,
regarding the proper approach in securing a
date with different Stanford women, and how
to succeed in a romantic campaign. It is time
this situation is cleared up.
Now you must realize that anything I may
say from here on is from observation and
advice from others. It is not from personal
experience, because as everyone knows I don't
go out with girls.
The first type of Stanford woman we will

consider will be the ultra-ultra suave sophisti
cate. This type of woman must be handled
in a very cagey manner or the chips are
against you at the outset.
First comes the casual "Hello, there" on
campus. This must not be a boisterous or very
friendly greeting. It must be murmured al
most inaudibly and in a don't-caritis fashion.
This shows the prospective date that you are
above the cliche, hubba-hubba, boorish ap
proach.
Next comes the phone call. Now this must
be planned in advance. You must first gargle
with a good portion of Listerine so your vocal
cords will be in top condition and a good Orson
Welles type of speech may be secured. That
low masculine guality will make a great im
pression. Also, practice being a little blase in
your tone.
After you have talked with the prospective
date for a few minutes on chit-chatty, over-the
cocktail sort of conversation, it is time to spring
the date guestion. This type of girl cannot be
taken to a fireside, a campus dance, or out for
a beer. She just isn't the type. So you casu
ally say something about, "How about running
up to the City one of these nights?" You know,
as if you do it every other night.
She undoubtedly will see her way clear to
make the date, so as you hang up the phone,
you yawn something about, "I'll pick you up
at 7:30 and maybe we can hit a hotel for danc
ing." Act bored by it all. This goes over big.
But now is the time to really go into action.
First you race to get reservations at the best
table at the St. Francis, borrow the best-looking
car in the house and arrange for about three
good-sized orchids to be sent the night of the
date. Just as if you do it all the time. There's
the date and the procedure. By all means act
bored by it all.
The next type of Stanford woman is of the
rugged, gaggy variety. When this type of
woman comes to the phone you must scream
loudly, "Hya, sport, whatcha doin'?" This
shows her you're a real good, earthy guy.
Then you talk about so much nonsense and
make her giggle as much as possible. If she
says something about, "Oh, you're so clever,"
you're in. You might memorize some old Chap
pie jokes just for an insurance.
Another thing: Whenever you see the girl's
roommate you rush up to her and say, "You
know, you're so attractive, I really don't know
whether I should take out your roommate or
you." This puts you in solid with the roomie.
That's very important in this case.
For a date you must start in the afternoon
with horseback riding. After that come three
sets of tennis and maybe you could invite her
into a touch football game with some of the
fellows. This type is rugged and likes to be
able to show her stuff. At night you polish off
the day's activities with a couple of hours'
bowling. Admitted, this will wear you down
to the ankles, but it's the only way to meet the
situation with any success at all.
The other type of woman is the intellectual.
She's the one who is plus twice her units in
the Bawlout—and she doesn't mind telling you
at least a dozen times during the course of the
evening.
The best way to initiate a friendship in this
league is to drop over to her living group some
evening and discuss some common problem
relating to your studies. Of course this may
mean boning up on the subject for several
hours before the visit, but it's worth it.
On the date you must be sure to have some
ready information of world-wide importance
to offer. Nothing giddy in this type of woman.
She's the career variety, and you must be sure
to let her know that she won't fail in her en
deavors. She already is convinced of the fact,
but it makes her feel good to hear it from you
anythow.
Another point: never disagree with her. The
extent of your conversation could very well
be, "That's right, you're so right, and yes sir!"
You must show definite enthusiasm regarding
her intelligence.
As for a place to go, be sure and pick a nice
guiet spot where you can talk—or rather where
she can talk. Once in a while hit the opera
or the symphony, but be sure and brief your
self on the background of the thing first, and
by all means know the conductor's first name,
where he was born, his mother's maiden name
and how many gold teeth he has. This will
make you seem to be an intimate acquaintance
of the gent's.
Now there's the background, the technique
and the procedure. If this fails, there's always

There has been a lot of discussion about
campus, fostered by some of the new fellows,
regarding the proper approach in securing a
date with different Stanford women, and how
to succeed in a romantic campaign. It is time
this situation is cleared up.
Now you must realize that anything I may
say from here on is from observation and
advice from others. It is not from personal
experience, because as everyone knows I don't
go out with girls.
The first type of Stanford woman we will

consider will be the ultra-ultra suave sophisti
cate. This type of woman must be handled
in a very cagey manner or the chips are
against you at the outset.
First comes the casual "Hello, there" on
campus. This must not be a boisterous or very
friendly greeting. It must be murmured al
most inaudibly and in a don't-caritis fashion.
This shows the prospective date that you are
above the cliche, hubba-hubba, boorish ap
proach.
Next comes the phone call. Now this must
be planned in advance. You must first gargle
with a good portion of Listerine so your vocal
cords will be in top condition and a good Orson
Welles type of speech may be secured. That
low masculine guality will make a great im
pression. Also, practice being a little blase in
your tone.
After you have talked with the prospective
date for a few minutes on chit-chatty, over-the
cocktail sort of conversation, it is time to spring
the date guestion. This type of girl cannot be
taken to a fireside, a campus dance, or out for
a beer. She just isn't the type. So you casu
ally say something about, "How about running
up to the City one of these nights?" You know,
as if you do it every other night.
She undoubtedly will see her way clear to
make the date, so as you hang up the phone,
you yawn something about, "I'll pick you up
at 7:30 and maybe we can hit a hotel for danc
ing." Act bored by it all. This goes over big.
But now is the time to really go into action.
First you race to get reservations at the best
table at the St. Francis, borrow the best-looking
car in the house and arrange for about three
good-sized orchids to be sent the night of the
date. Just as if you do it all the time. There's
the date and the procedure. By all means act
bored by it all.
The next type of Stanford woman is of the
rugged, gaggy variety. When this type of
woman comes to the phone you must scream
loudly, "Hya, sport, whatcha doin'?" This
shows her you're a real good, earthy guy.
Then you talk about so much nonsense and
make her giggle as much as possible. If she
says something about, "Oh, you're so clever,"
you're in. You might memorize some old Chap
pie jokes just for an insurance.
Another thing: Whenever you see the girl's
roommate you rush up to her and say, "You
know, you're so attractive, I really don't know
whether I should take out your roommate or
you." This puts you in solid with the roomie.
That's very important in this case.
For a date you must start in the afternoon
with horseback riding. After that come three
sets of tennis and maybe you could invite her
into a touch football game with some of the
fellows. This type is rugged and likes to be
able to show her stuff. At night you polish off
the day's activities with a couple of hours'
bowling. Admitted, this will wear you down
to the ankles, but it's the only way to meet the
situation with any success at all.
The other type of woman is the intellectual.
She's the one who is plus twice her units in
the Bawlout—and she doesn't mind telling you
at least a dozen times during the course of the
evening.
The best way to initiate a friendship in this
league is to drop over to her living group some
evening and discuss some common problem
relating to your studies. Of course this may
mean boning up on the subject for several
hours before the visit, but it's worth it.
On the date you must be sure to have some
ready information of world-wide importance
to offer. Nothing giddy in this type of woman.
She's the career variety, and you must be sure
to let her know that she won't fail in her en
deavors. She already is convinced of the fact,
but it makes her feel good to hear it from you
anythow.
Another point: never disagree with her. The
extent of your conversation could very well
be, "That's right, you're so right, and yes sir!"
You must show definite enthusiasm regarding
her intelligence.
As for a place to go, be sure and pick a nice
guiet spot where you can talk—or rather where
she can talk. Once in a while hit the opera
or the symphony, but be sure and brief your
self on the background of the thing first, and
by all means know the conductor's first name,
where he was born, his mother's maiden name
and how many gold teeth he has. This will
make you seem to be an intimate acquaintance
of the gent's.
Now there's the background, the technique
and the procedure. If this fails, there's always
Paly High.
