# Work Reads War Poetry
## Poems of Hardy, Owen Featured 
### 
Selections by Thomas Hardy that
were written previous to World War
I, but included because of their
universal theme, were the first read
by Acting Professor James Work
yesterday from the poetry of the
two world wars.
In comparing the two periods,
Mr. Work said that more jingoistic
poetry was written during the first
World War than has been written
about the recent war.
'Drummer Hodge'
"Drummer Hodge," one of the
most famous war poems, and"The
Man I Killed," which were written
about the Boer War, were chosen
to represent the poetry of Thomas
Hardy.
The poems "Arms and the Boy,"
"Greater Love," "Sweet to Die for
Your Country," "Apologia pro Po
emate Meo," and "Strange Meeting"
by Wilfred Owen, who was killed in
1918, were read.
Other War Poems
Other great poems from World
War I were those by Siegfried
Sassoon, of which Mr. Work
read "Counter-Attack," "The Rear
Guard," "The Mystic," "They," "In
the Guard Room," "Does It Matter,"
and"The Kiss."
..Also read from the poetry of the
first World War was "Death of a
Soldier" by Wallace Stevens.
'Memorial Rain'
A war poem written in the period
between the two wars that Mr.
Work read was Archibald Mac-
Leish's "Memorial Rain," which is
a reflection of the war during a
patriotic speech.
Poems from the present war in
cluded two by Walter Benton,
"Summary of the Distance Between
a Bomber and Its Objective" and
"With the Mind." For the latter
poem Benton wrote a particularly
subtle line, "There is a better way
to kill a louse, than to destroy the
body it lives on."
Recommends Jeffers
"Plato Told Him" by E. E. Cum
mings, "To a Military Rifle" by Yvor
Winters, anil "Fable" by Frederick
Prokosh were also read. Although
he did not read from Robinson Jef
fers, Mr. Work recommended this
author's bitterly disillusioned po
etry.
Only one poem by a woman, Mar
ianne Moore's "In Distrust of Mer
its," was read. This poem is ideal
istic and much of the meaning seems
obscure.
Tlie poetry reading was concluded
with "If on the Account of the Po
litical Situation," by W. H. Auden.
Although this poem was written
before the news of the atomic bomb,
it expresses the current feeling to
ward the newly discovered atomic
power.—Barlow.
