CHINESE OPERATIONS
Chinese military operations are still in the
formative stage, but the situation seems to be
more obvious as reports come in.
The front is parabolic in shape, with the base
up at Peking, the eastern arm running irregu
larly through Hopeh and Shansi provinces,
and the western arm, disconnected from the
base, fighting mostly in Shantung.
A Nationalist army is concentrated at Peking,
and it keeps the wings of the Communist forces
separated. Also, it stands as a menace to the
left rear of the Communist right, where their
main army is deployed.
This army was moved into position thanks
to American air transport. It didn't get time
to consolidate its rear, and the Communists
have taken advantage of this by sending a
detached force into Hopeh province, behind it,
and breaking up 100 miles of its supply line,
the Peking-Hankow railroad.
Hopeh Army
It is difficult to say what size force this is.
It might be simply a raiding detachment, which
will pull out as soon as things become un
tenable. In fact, it probably is. However, it
might also be a good-sized army that intends
to fall on the rear of the one in Peking, and is
not breaking the railroad to cover its own rear.
Today, though, a new army has been landed

I on the gulf. It is exceptionally well eguipped
i and might join the one at Peking to attack the
: Communist Hopeh army if it tries to move north
in considerable force.
Rest of Situation
It is difficult to analyze the rest of the situ
! ation, because it is so fluid. However, a large
Nationalist army seems to be driving on the
Communist forces in Shansi and on the road to
Yenan itself. If this force can put enough pres
sure on the Communists, they might be forced
to recall whatever strength they have in Hopeh
in order to bolster their lines.
However, it is difficult to say that the Com
munist forces in this sector can be decisively
dealt with. The terrain is difficult, and this
should allow them to get away into Mongolia
if the fighting becomes too difficult.
There is another story in Shantung, however.
The lapanese army there, when leaving, sold
its ammunition freely to both sides. Trouble
started, and the Nationalists built their forces
up to 14 divisions line strength. The Commu
nist army is being engaged in serious battle.
It is doubtful that it can get away unless it man
ages to sidestep its enemy and move north for
a junction with the troops in Hopeh. In fact,
the force there might have to divert a large
detachment, if it has such a thing, to relieve
the Shantung Communists.
The Chinese civil war has become a full-scale
affair. The main Communist forces should have
no difficulty in pulling out of the country if that
should be necessary, but large pockets in Shan
tung and in provinces to the south are in danger
' of being ruined.

main army is deployed.
This army was moved into position thanks
to American air transport. It didn't get time
to consolidate its rear, and the Communists
have taken advantage of this by sending a
detached force into Hopeh province, behind it,
and breaking up 100 miles of its supply line,
the Peking-Hankow railroad.
Hopeh Army
It is difficult to say what size force this is.
It might be simply a raiding detachment, which
will pull out as soon as things become un
tenable. In fact, it probably is. However, it
might also be a good-sized army that intends
to fall on the rear of the one in Peking, and is
not breaking the railroad to cover its own rear.
Today, though, a new army has been landed

I on the gulf. It is exceptionally well eguipped
i and might join the one at Peking to attack the
: Communist Hopeh army if it tries to move north
in considerable force.
Rest of Situation
It is difficult to analyze the rest of the situ
! ation, because it is so fluid. However, a large
Nationalist army seems to be driving on the
Communist forces in Shansi and on the road to
Yenan itself. If this force can put enough pres
sure on the Communists, they might be forced
to recall whatever strength they have in Hopeh
in order to bolster their lines.
However, it is difficult to say that the Com
munist forces in this sector can be decisively
dealt with. The terrain is difficult, and this
should allow them to get away into Mongolia
if the fighting becomes too difficult.
There is another story in Shantung, however.
The lapanese army there, when leaving, sold
its ammunition freely to both sides. Trouble
started, and the Nationalists built their forces
up to 14 divisions line strength. The Commu
nist army is being engaged in serious battle.
It is doubtful that it can get away unless it man
ages to sidestep its enemy and move north for
a junction with the troops in Hopeh. In fact,
the force there might have to divert a large
detachment, if it has such a thing, to relieve
the Shantung Communists.
The Chinese civil war has become a full-scale
affair. The main Communist forces should have
no difficulty in pulling out of the country if that
should be necessary, but large pockets in Shan
tung and in provinces to the south are in danger
' of being ruined.
CHINESE OPERATIONS
Chinese military operations are still in the
formative stage, but the situation seems to be
more obvious as reports come in.
The front is parabolic in shape, with the base
up at Peking, the eastern arm running irregu
larly through Hopeh and Shansi provinces,
and the western arm, disconnected from the
base, fighting mostly in Shantung.
A Nationalist army is concentrated at Peking,
and it keeps the wings of the Communist forces
separated. Also, it stands as a menace to the
left rear of the Communist right, where their
main army is deployed.
