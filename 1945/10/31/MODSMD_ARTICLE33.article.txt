# Electricians Battle ‘Eagles’ To Give Hoover Tower Light
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
It was a bleak spring night for
Stanford students when the light in
the Hoover Tower cupola burned
out; but it was an equally terrifying
evening for the electrciian who
started his climb up the ladder to
replace the burned-out globe.
A few minutes later the phone
jangled in the Corporation Yard
office. "There's a nest of eagles up
here in the cupola," a frightened
electrician reported to Mr. William
L. Smith, assistant superintendent
of buildings and grounds.
Smith to the Rescue
Mr. Smith joined the electrician
in a short time, and together they
prepared to face the huge birds. As
the men began their climb up into
the dark cupola, the birds backed
up into a corner, fierce and growl
ing.
At last the globe was in place and
the light on. The men turned to
survey the "eagles' nest." Instead
a group of large night owls glared
at them, belligerent and angered at
being disturbed.
All in the Day's Work
The "eagles' nest" incident is all
in the day's work for the Corpora
tion Yard staff, "whose tasks in
volve the maintenance of the whole
physical plant of the University,"
according to Mr. Smith. Fifty per
cent of the yard's work Ls devoted
to the care of Stanford's buildings,
grounds, and roads.
"There is always something to be
done, repairs to be made. Someone
Ls always in trouble, day or night,
and our staff is on hand to iron out
the difficulties," he added. "No one
ever calls up here unless he wants
something done."
Plumbers and Electricians
Mr. Smith pointed out that the
plumbers and electricians are al
ways on the job. Under the leader
ship of Mr. Frank T. Thommin,
steam engineer and plumber fore
man, part of the Corporation Yard
staff is busy caring for the pipes
that carry the steam from Stanford's
central heating plant to all the
buildings and dorms.
At the present time the men are
cleaning out the flumes in the foot
hills, getting rid of the silt, weeds,
and leaves to prevent the campus
from being flooded in the wet sea
son. In the spring the surplus water
is allowed to flow into Lagunita
Lake. Chlorination of the water in
co-operation with the Palo Alto city
health department to keep the water
free from bacteria is still another
task.
Everyone Co-operates
"Everyone on the yard staff has
to co-operate to keep the Univer
sity running," Mr. Smith stated.
Mr. Sam W. Hills and his electri-

cians aid the water department in
servicing the pumps. The electri
cians also have the job oi' keeping
lights burning in school buildings,
the dorms, on the streets, and in the
colonnades.
Upkeep of the Farm's 9,000 acres
with all its buildings means an 85-
to 100-man staff of carpenters, me
chanics, painters, gardeners, ma
sons, landscapers, road builders and
repairers.
Foremen in Charge
Foremen Frank D. Barnham, Ben
Facciolla, George Greene, H. Carlyn
Scherer, John W. Schilling, and L.
C. Webb have charge of keeping the
buildings and grounds in condition.
Mr. Paul J. Todsen and Mrs. Willa
S. Woodard keep the records of all
the jobs done and the hours spent,
in addition to taking the phone calls
and complaints which come to the
yard office every day.
The Two "Macs"
''Mr. J. W. McDonnell heads the
maintenance of buildings and
grounds," Smilh stated, "and, for
the benefit of the newcomer, he is
not to be confused with Mr. Sam
Mac Donald, superintendent of the
Board of Athletic Control's corpora
tion yard." Mac Donald heads the
maintenance of all the athletic
grounds, facilities, and practice
fields.
These are the men who work be
hind the scenes at Stanford. On a
stormy night, such as Tuesday, a
yard crew was out with its tractor
in the wind and rain to haul out a
fallen tree behind Tyler. When the
buildings are quiet at night a staff
of 40 janitors sweep the floors and
clean the blackboards and erasers.
For Stanford's yard crew, life is
just one round of leaky roofs, bro
ken window panes, fallen power
lines, lawns to be cut, and broken
plaster.

At last the globe was in place and
the light on. The men turned to
survey the "eagles' nest." Instead
a group of large night owls glared
at them, belligerent and angered at
being disturbed.
All in the Day's Work
The "eagles' nest" incident is all
in the day's work for the Corpora
tion Yard staff, "whose tasks in
volve the maintenance of the whole
physical plant of the University,"
according to Mr. Smith. Fifty per
cent of the yard's work Ls devoted
to the care of Stanford's buildings,
grounds, and roads.
"There is always something to be
done, repairs to be made. Someone
Ls always in trouble, day or night,
and our staff is on hand to iron out
the difficulties," he added. "No one
ever calls up here unless he wants
something done."
Plumbers and Electricians
Mr. Smith pointed out that the
plumbers and electricians are al
ways on the job. Under the leader
ship of Mr. Frank T. Thommin,
steam engineer and plumber fore
man, part of the Corporation Yard
staff is busy caring for the pipes
that carry the steam from Stanford's
central heating plant to all the
buildings and dorms.
At the present time the men are
cleaning out the flumes in the foot
hills, getting rid of the silt, weeds,
and leaves to prevent the campus
from being flooded in the wet sea
son. In the spring the surplus water
is allowed to flow into Lagunita
Lake. Chlorination of the water in
co-operation with the Palo Alto city
health department to keep the water
free from bacteria is still another
task.
Everyone Co-operates
"Everyone on the yard staff has
to co-operate to keep the Univer
sity running," Mr. Smith stated.
Mr. Sam W. Hills and his electri-

cians aid the water department in
servicing the pumps. The electri
cians also have the job oi' keeping
lights burning in school buildings,
the dorms, on the streets, and in the
colonnades.
Upkeep of the Farm's 9,000 acres
with all its buildings means an 85-
to 100-man staff of carpenters, me
chanics, painters, gardeners, ma
sons, landscapers, road builders and
repairers.
Foremen in Charge
Foremen Frank D. Barnham, Ben
Facciolla, George Greene, H. Carlyn
Scherer, John W. Schilling, and L.
C. Webb have charge of keeping the
buildings and grounds in condition.
Mr. Paul J. Todsen and Mrs. Willa
S. Woodard keep the records of all
the jobs done and the hours spent,
in addition to taking the phone calls
and complaints which come to the
yard office every day.
The Two "Macs"
''Mr. J. W. McDonnell heads the
maintenance of buildings and
grounds," Smilh stated, "and, for
the benefit of the newcomer, he is
not to be confused with Mr. Sam
Mac Donald, superintendent of the
Board of Athletic Control's corpora
tion yard." Mac Donald heads the
maintenance of all the athletic
grounds, facilities, and practice
fields.
These are the men who work be
hind the scenes at Stanford. On a
stormy night, such as Tuesday, a
yard crew was out with its tractor
in the wind and rain to haul out a
fallen tree behind Tyler. When the
buildings are quiet at night a staff
of 40 janitors sweep the floors and
clean the blackboards and erasers.
For Stanford's yard crew, life is
just one round of leaky roofs, bro
ken window panes, fallen power
lines, lawns to be cut, and broken
plaster.
It was a bleak spring night for
Stanford students when the light in
the Hoover Tower cupola burned
out; but it was an equally terrifying
evening for the electrciian who
started his climb up the ladder to
replace the burned-out globe.
A few minutes later the phone
jangled in the Corporation Yard
office. "There's a nest of eagles up
here in the cupola," a frightened
electrician reported to Mr. William
L. Smith, assistant superintendent
of buildings and grounds.
Smith to the Rescue
Mr. Smith joined the electrician
in a short time, and together they
prepared to face the huge birds. As
the men began their climb up into
the dark cupola, the birds backed
up into a corner, fierce and growl
ing.
At last the globe was in place and
the light on. The men turned to
survey the "eagles' nest." Instead
a group of large night owls glared
at them, belligerent and angered at

the difficulties," he added. "No one
ever calls up here unless he wants
something done."
Plumbers and Electricians
Mr. Smith pointed out that the
plumbers and electricians are al
ways on the job. Under the leader
ship of Mr. Frank T. Thommin,
steam engineer and plumber fore
man, part of the Corporation Yard
staff is busy caring for the pipes
that carry the steam from Stanford's
central heating plant to all the
buildings and dorms.
At the present time the men are
cleaning out the flumes in the foot
hills, getting rid of the silt, weeds,
and leaves to prevent the campus
from being flooded in the wet sea
son. In the spring the surplus water
is allowed to flow into Lagunita
Lake. Chlorination of the water in
co-operation with the Palo Alto city
health department to keep the water
free from bacteria is still another
task.
Everyone Co-operates
"Everyone on the yard staff has
to co-operate to keep the Univer
sity running," Mr. Smith stated.
Mr. Sam W. Hills and his electri-

cians aid the water department in
servicing the pumps. The electri
cians also have the job oi' keeping
lights burning in school buildings,
the dorms, on the streets, and in the
colonnades.
Upkeep of the Farm's 9,000 acres
with all its buildings means an 85-
to 100-man staff of carpenters, me
chanics, painters, gardeners, ma
sons, landscapers, road builders and
repairers.
Foremen in Charge
Foremen Frank D. Barnham, Ben
Facciolla, George Greene, H. Carlyn
Scherer, John W. Schilling, and L.
C. Webb have charge of keeping the
buildings and grounds in condition.
Mr. Paul J. Todsen and Mrs. Willa
S. Woodard keep the records of all
the jobs done and the hours spent,
in addition to taking the phone calls
and complaints which come to the
yard office every day.
The Two "Macs"
''Mr. J. W. McDonnell heads the
maintenance of buildings and
grounds," Smilh stated, "and, for
the benefit of the newcomer, he is
not to be confused with Mr. Sam
Mac Donald, superintendent of the
Board of Athletic Control's corpora
tion yard." Mac Donald heads the
maintenance of all the athletic
grounds, facilities, and practice
fields.
These are the men who work be
hind the scenes at Stanford. On a
stormy night, such as Tuesday, a
yard crew was out with its tractor
in the wind and rain to haul out a
fallen tree behind Tyler. When the
buildings are quiet at night a staff
of 40 janitors sweep the floors and
clean the blackboards and erasers.
For Stanford's yard crew, life is
just one round of leaky roofs, bro
ken window panes, fallen power
lines, lawns to be cut, and broken
plaster.
It was a bleak spring night for
Stanford students when the light in
the Hoover Tower cupola burned
out; but it was an equally terrifying
evening for the electrciian who
started his climb up the ladder to
replace the burned-out globe.
A few minutes later the phone
jangled in the Corporation Yard
office. "There's a nest of eagles up
here in the cupola," a frightened
electrician reported to Mr. William
L. Smith, assistant superintendent
of buildings and grounds.
Smith to the Rescue
Mr. Smith joined the electrician
in a short time, and together they
prepared to face the huge birds. As
the men began their climb up into
the dark cupola, the birds backed
up into a corner, fierce and growl
ing.
At last the globe was in place and
the light on. The men turned to
survey the "eagles' nest." Instead
a group of large night owls glared
at them, belligerent and angered at
being disturbed.
All in the Day's Work
The "eagles' nest" incident is all
in the day's work for the Corpora
tion Yard staff, "whose tasks in
volve the maintenance of the whole
physical plant of the University,"
according to Mr. Smith. Fifty per
cent of the yard's work Ls devoted
to the care of Stanford's buildings,
grounds, and roads.
"There is always something to be
done, repairs to be made. Someone
Ls always in trouble, day or night,
and our staff is on hand to iron out
the difficulties," he added. "No one
ever calls up here unless he wants
something done."
