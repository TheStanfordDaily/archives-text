# 'Competent' Cast Heads Canadian Mounties Saga
## Varsity Features 'Shoot-em-Up’ Picture and 'Remember the Day’ 
### 
NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE
—now playing at the Varsity
Theater.
Cecil B. DeMille's imperialistic
saga of the "Northwest Mounted
Police" has been exhumed by Para
mount for reshowing and still stands
as one of the more gaudy Techni
color feasts to come out of Holly
wood. The large, competent cast
is headed by Gary Cooper, Paill
ette Goddard, Madeline Carroll, and
Robert Preston.
Plot Involved
There are three or four stories
running throughout "Northwest
Mounted Police," plus the usual
shoot-'em-up activity that high
lights every DeMille production.
Gary Cooper, in another of his
dogged, long-drink-of-water roles,
is seen as a Texas Ranger who has
trekked up into Canada to "get his
man." It happens that the Mounties,
headed by virile Preston Foster v
are after the same gent as Cooper,
and these two stories dovetail into
one.
There's plenty of rugged love
making in the picture, notably the
sexy little affair between Paulette
Goddard and Robert Preston. Miss
Goddard is cast as a minxy Indian
half-breed and really gave your re
viewer's broken-down libido a
much-needed boost. ("Libido" is a

very interesting word the meaning
of which you should know.)
Madeline Carroll, one of the pret
tiest women ever to hit Holly wood,
and Gary Cooper carry on a rather
fidgety romance that should pacify
the older members of the audience.
Supporting Cast Good
The supporting cast is sparked by
the late Lynne Overman and Akitn
Tamiroff, who engage in a farcial
feud that is terminated in a strip
tease shooting match in which the
pair shoot the clothing off each
other. Overman was certainly one
of the screen's best character actors.
"Northwest Mounted Police" is a
lavish, sprawling film that will satis
fy those who are looking for sheer
spectacle.
The second feature on the Varsity
double-header is an old 2()th Cen
tury-Fox release, "Remember the
Day," that stars the venerable
Claudette Colbert and silver-voiced
John Payne. "Remember the Day"
has all the ingredients of a stuffy
turn of the century story but adroit
direction by Henry King transforms
it into an entertaining, sympathetic
picture. It is one of the few ex
amples in which Hollywood has not
let sentimentality run wild. — Dick
Bower.

color feasts to come out of Holly
wood. The large, competent cast
is headed by Gary Cooper, Paill
ette Goddard, Madeline Carroll, and
Robert Preston.
Plot Involved
There are three or four stories
running throughout "Northwest
Mounted Police," plus the usual
shoot-'em-up activity that high
lights every DeMille production.
Gary Cooper, in another of his
dogged, long-drink-of-water roles,
is seen as a Texas Ranger who has
trekked up into Canada to "get his
man." It happens that the Mounties,
headed by virile Preston Foster v
are after the same gent as Cooper,
and these two stories dovetail into
one.
There's plenty of rugged love
making in the picture, notably the
sexy little affair between Paulette
Goddard and Robert Preston. Miss
Goddard is cast as a minxy Indian
half-breed and really gave your re
viewer's broken-down libido a
much-needed boost. ("Libido" is a

very interesting word the meaning
of which you should know.)
Madeline Carroll, one of the pret
tiest women ever to hit Holly wood,
and Gary Cooper carry on a rather
fidgety romance that should pacify
the older members of the audience.
Supporting Cast Good
The supporting cast is sparked by
the late Lynne Overman and Akitn
Tamiroff, who engage in a farcial
feud that is terminated in a strip
tease shooting match in which the
pair shoot the clothing off each
other. Overman was certainly one
of the screen's best character actors.
"Northwest Mounted Police" is a
lavish, sprawling film that will satis
fy those who are looking for sheer
spectacle.
The second feature on the Varsity
double-header is an old 2()th Cen
tury-Fox release, "Remember the
Day," that stars the venerable
Claudette Colbert and silver-voiced
John Payne. "Remember the Day"
has all the ingredients of a stuffy
turn of the century story but adroit
direction by Henry King transforms
it into an entertaining, sympathetic
picture. It is one of the few ex
amples in which Hollywood has not
let sentimentality run wild. — Dick
Bower.
NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE

Cecil B. DeMille's imperialistic
saga of the "Northwest Mounted
Police" has been exhumed by Para

as one of the more gaudy Techni
color feasts to come out of Holly

is headed by Gary Cooper, Paill
