On January 18, 1924 eighteen en
thusiastic Stanford mothers met in
Palo Alto to consider the forma
tion of an organization to act in
cooperation with the faculty to help
students in need of financial help
and home care. These mothers
proved to be the vanguard of the
Stanford Mothers' Club which now
lists thousands of women on its
membership list.
Soon after (he official charter
ing of the club, I)r. Kay Lyman
Wilbur, then president of Stan
ford University, remarked that to
him the important feature of (he
Mothers' Club was (he opportuni
ty given to (he mothers to learn
about college life directly from
(he students and faculty.
The members of this organiza
tion, keenly feeling the need of pro
viding home care for those students
not ill enough to go to a hospital,
look ailing students directly into
their homes.
The Mothers' Club, however, soon
realized that their undertaking was
too large for the members to handle
alone and that additional nursing
facilities had to be found for th?
::tudents.
This was the birth of Stanford's
(wo Rest Homes for Men and
Women. Under (he club's guid
ance these (wo homes are slill
functioning.
Another important feature of the
Mothers' Club is the Scholarship
and Welfare Committee that func
tions through the Dean of Students'
office and assists men and women
who need financial help in order to
continue their studies.
