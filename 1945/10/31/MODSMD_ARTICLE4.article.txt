# Branner Plans Candy Formal On Saturday
## 
### 
"Branner will go peppermint-mad
in a formal way this Saturday,"
stated Cathy Morris, general chair
man of the closed "Peppermint
Lane" formal to be held in the
Branner lobby Saturday evening,
from 0 to 1.
Bids will be in the shape of red
and white peppermint sticks, said
Miss Morris, and the program cov
ers will also be striped, and will
have ''Peppermint Lane" printed
across them. Bids are being sold
by corridor representatives, and may
be purchased by Branner women
only.
Stripped Lobby
The entrance to the lobby will
resemble a candy house, according
to Dinda Hawley, head of the dec
oration committee. "The pillars in
the lobby will be disguised as enorm
ous red and white peppermint
sticks," said Miss Hawley, "and a
candy man and woman will be sta
tioned on either side of the fire
place."
The peppermint theme will hold
sway even in the refreshments, ac
cording to Jean Stout, chairman of
the committee. She has announced
that peppermint ice cream and cake
with peppermint striped frosting
will be served.
Tcn-Piccc Orchestra
Bert Whiting, his ten-piece or
chestra, and vocalist have been en
grged for the dance, stated Miss
Morris, and will play in the lobby.
"Dancing won't be restricted to the
lobby, however," she continued,
"but will also be in progress in
the wings connecting the main part
of the building and the dining
room."
She added that if the weather is
suitable, the doors to the patio and
the doors across the front of Bran
npr will be opened, and couples
may dance on the veranda in front
of Branner.
