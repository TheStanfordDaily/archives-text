This Saturday one of the top games on the coast this season
will be played when the St. Mary's Gaels meet the Trojans of
U.S.C. at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Sports fans who have been
I watching the Galloping Gaels (and who hasn't) have been look
ing forward to this contest for a long time. This game will be
the ultimate test for the Gaels, and if they win, they can right
fully claim a place among the five top teams of the nation.
The Gaels go south this week full of confidence and with
a feeling that they will beat the Trojans. And for that matter
you can't blame them for having this feeling when they have
such ball players as Herman Wedemeyer and little Spike Cor
deiro on their side. Wedemeyer has thrown eight touchdown
passes, scored 37 points himself, and carried the ball 50 times
for 251 yardsâ€”five yards per try in five games.
Wedemeyer Great
That isn't a bad record in anybody's books. With a record
like that on offense, and just as excellent a one on defense, it
is of little wonder that coaches, writers, and John Q. Public
have picked Wedemeyer as the greatest all-around football
player ever to develop in the West and the nation's "No. 1 Ail-
American." Bill Leiser, of the San Francisco Chronicle, and
others have gone as far as to say that Wedemeyer is the greatest
player ever.
Spike Cordeiro doesn't have to be ashamed of his record
either. Spike has carried the ball 30 times for 217 yards and a
7 2 average. He leads the team in scoring with 7 touchdowns
for 42 points. Paul Crowe, another Gael back, has packed the
pigskin 21 times for 190 yards, and an average gain of nine yards
every try.
Opponents held to 13
Here are some more figures to support those who pick the
Gaels over El Trojan. St. Mary's has scored 204 points in five
games, against 13 for the opposition. The 13 points were picked
by the University of California in the opening game of the season
when the Bears had a contingent that they could call a football
team. In the last four games the Gaels' opponents have gone
scoreless.
The only worry St. Mary's has is that it is weak on replace
ments. Jimmy Phelan, the Gael coach, has to figure out a sys
tem where he can play the whole 60 minutes with 15 or 16 men,
which isn't the easiest thing to do. This situation isn't helped
out a bit with Harvey Adair, tackle and star linesman, sitting
in the hospital with a twisted knee.
Don't let us give you the impression that the boys from
Moraga are going to walk all over U.S.C. The Trojans' loss to
Washington last week may make them tougher than ever. They
will be out for blood to avenge their defeat of last week-end,
and raise their prestige in the football world.
We Pick the Gaels
The residents of Los Angeles are expected to turn out in
great numbers to see Wedemeyer and Cordeiro, the two boys
they have heard such glowing reports about. Two weeks ago
over 80,000 of the 105,000 seats in the Coliseum had been sold
out.
The contest should be the game of the season, and besides
the thousands who will see the game, there will be many more
thousands glued to their radios listening to the Gaels defeating
the mighty Trojan from Southern California. Yes, we pick St.
Mary's by at least 14 points.
