SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 30 (UP).
â€”After two weeks of rest the un
defeated San Diego Bombers meet
the Los Angeles Bulldogs Sunday
in the featured game of the week
end Pacific Coast professional foot
ball league program.
In other tilts, league-leading
Oakland Giants meet the last-place
San Jose Mustangs at Oakland and
the San Francisco Clippers invade
Hollywood.
Sparked by diminutive Mel Reid,
the Giants have won four straight
games and should not meet much
trouble against the winless Mus
tangs.
The Bombers get their stiffest test
against the Bulldogs, who showed
a major improvement in beating
San Jose last week. The Hollywood
team is expected to repeat its trick
of whipping San Francisco a couple
of weeks ago by a 21-0 count.
