# SLANTING IDELINES
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Working in the rain yesterday
afternoon, the Stanford football
team ran through their first scrim
mage. The tricky T plays are being
smoothed out, and the line is im
proving on their tackling. No start
ing eleven has been announced yet,
but before many more practices
roll by, Coach Schwartz should
have have a good idea of who his
best men are.
Are You Qualified?
The quarterback has to be a good
passer, a careful ball handler, and
a distance kicker, if possible. There
are very few plays on which the
quarterback runs with the pigskin,
although if the quarter is a speed
merchant, he plays safety. Albert—
a quarterback—played safety, but it
would be possible for the other
backfield men to play that spot.
Halfbacks have to show more de
ception than a soldier behind enemy
lines. Either half is used for the
man in motion, the deceiving fea
ture of the T formation. Halfbacks
also pass and snag passes, too. Norm
Standlee was the ideal fullback: a
heavy line plunger.
New Formations
Steve Owen is working with a
new A formation with the New York
Giants. The play combines the de
ception of the T with the forward
charge of the single wing. But
judging by the results of this ever
so tricky formation, the opposition
hasn't been too hoodwinked. Which
proves that a good backfield can
work with any formation and have
fair success.
Of course it helps to have a back
field suited to a patricular forma
tion. The reason Marchie Schwartz
prefers the T is that every backfield
man doesn't have to be a triple
threat ace. If a man is a good run
ner, he can be used at half. If he
passes and runs, the quarterback
spot is the place for him. If he just
passes, a halfback spot might be
worked out for him.
Would Schwartz go back to the
single wing if he had four Tom Har
mons or Nile Kinnicks around? We
doubt it. A beautiful offense could
be worked up with that combo, but
a much better offense would be
framed using the T formation.
Rose Bowl Gab
The story is out now that West
Point will play in the Rose Bowl, if
they go through the season unde
feated. Permission, supposedly, has
been granted from the military
hierarchy to throw in a post-season
game this year. As matters now
stand, the opponent for the game is
more certain than the home team.
Washington—at the moment—is sit
ting on the top of the fence by vir
tue of drubbing El Trojan. But that

seat at the top of the feftce is
mighty slippery.
Huskies Set for Season
The Huskies should get by with
out losing another tilt, but judging
by past performances in the Pacific
Coast Conference this year, it is
foolish to predict the Pest Welch
aggregation as being "in." Oregon
gave U.C.L.A. the scare of its life
—and the Westwood campus has
had some mighty big scares in its
existence—last Friday night under
the Mazda in Southern California.
But in the second half their of
fense fizzled out, and Cal Rossi, the
Santa Barbara speed boy at U.C.-
L.A., really got going, and by final
whistle time Frank Bull, the Asso
ciated sportscaster, announced that
Oregon had lost, 12-0. The same
Wefcfoot gang, playing in their own
territory, might upset the Seattle
Husky this Saturday post mortem.
It's a safer bet than some of these
Bower-picked nags at Bay Mead
ows.
