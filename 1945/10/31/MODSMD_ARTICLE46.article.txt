touch versiian of the pigskin art that the servicemen will be using, but
the natural rivalry promises that a close, hard-fought buttle is in the
oiling.
The scene of action will probably be Maloney Field, although extensive
efforts are under way to secure the use of the stadium. At any rate, every
one is urged to attend because, according to A.S.S.U. President Bob Ken
nedy, Farm yells will be practiced for the coming varsity contests.

Representing the Army will be
the outfit that has been ripping apart
all comers in intramural games this
fall. Led by Theis, their captain
and passing star, the soldier sextet
has bowled over all opposition in
then- league of the intramural loops.
Supporting Theis are such capable
individuals as Reed, Bunch, Manus.
McGuinness, Carrillo, David, and
Bonifay.
Personnel of the Navy's team are
unknown to your writer at the pres
ent except that it will be chosen
from the touch teams of their in
tramural leaguesâ€”and possibly a
few players from the varsity squad.
The sailors' potentialities are conse
quently a mystery, but with their
wealth of experienced material to
choose from they are bound to field
a well-stacked squad, especially if
a few varsity men are shoved into
the lineup.
Col. John R. Eden, commandant
of the Army units, has released the
AST students from one hour of their
Saturday afternoon drill in order to
permit everyone to attend the game.
