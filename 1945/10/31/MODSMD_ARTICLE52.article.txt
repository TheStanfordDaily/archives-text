SEATTLE, Oct. 30. (UP). â€” The
battlecry around the University of
Washington today was "look out for
Oregon" as the conquerors of the
mighty Trojans from Southern Cali
fornia prepared for their Saturday
meeting" with the Webfoots of Eu
gene.
Husky gridsters survived the Tro
jan game with no serious injuries.
Only Gail Bruce, who saw no ac
tion in the USC game, may be on
the sidelines at kickoff time in Mult
nomah Stadium Saturday. Bruce
suffered an injured knee in practice
before the Trojan game and hasn't
been up to par since.
However, the Marvin Hein-Joe
Stone combination will be set for the
Webfoots. The Huskies were con
fident, but not cocky, as they ripped
through workouts today.
