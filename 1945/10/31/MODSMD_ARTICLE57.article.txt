# Rhodes Scholars To Be Selected
## 
### 
Elections for Rhodes Scholarships
will be resumed in December, 194G,
announced Philip W. Buck, profes
sor of political science, recently, in
urging interested men to begin pre
paring themselves now for the com
petitions.
Mr. Buck, who is Institutional
Representative of Rhodes Scholar
ships at Stanford and Chairman of
the Committee on Rhodes Scholar
ships at Stanford, said that he is in
terested in interviewing possible
candidates for the scholarships im
mediately.
Top Rating Required
Requirements for the two-year
scholarship include a top scholastic
rating; possession of personal quali
ties of leadership; and, in the words
of Mr. Rhodes' will, a "healthy in
terest and willingness to participate
in manly sports."
Although the customary term for
the scholarship is two years, a stu
dent may apply for and receive a
third year, provided he has a "reas
onable scheme for using that third
year," stated Mr. Buck.
Scholarships To Oxford
Students who win scholarships are
sent to Oxford University in Eng
land for continued study in any
academic field given at Oxford. Ap
proximately 32 students from col
leges and universities in the United
States are chosen each year, follow
ing stiff examinations, to receive the
scholarships.
The practice was discontinued
during the war, because of travel
difficulties; so a Wartime Reserve
Scholai'ship plan has been set up
by which men who might have been
eligible during the war and are now
over-age may still compete, Mr.
Buck said. He added that about twice
as many scholarships as usual will
be open for the next three or four
years, to make up this wartime
deficit.
