CHINWANGTAO, North China,
Oct. 30 (UP). — Veteran troops of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek's
central government army, equipped
with American Garand rifles and
flame-throwers, marched to the
great wall of China today and
massed along the Communist-de
fended Manchurian border.
Thousands of green-clad National
ist forces, put ashore from U. S.
Navy transports in two waves while
American aircraft flashed overhead,
reached the great wall town of
Shanhaikwan while Communist
forces deployed warily a short dis
tance ahead.
Civil War Elements
Now all the elements for a full
fledged civil war were present in
this area of North China. Within
a radius of 50 miles there were
sizeable hostile forces of central
government forces —supported in
establishment of a beachhead by
U. S. forces—and Chinese Com
munists who enjoy at least the
friendly co-operation of the Soviet
Red army.
The Communists have sworn to
defend the border of Manchuria
against government incursions, cith
er by sea or land.
Army Landed
The first Nationalist army ele
ments were landed yesterday from
American vessels under cover of
dozens of U. S. carrier planes.
Communist officials of the North
eastern Peoples Army at Hulatao
said they had no information that
Mao Tze-Tung, Chinese Communist
leader, had agreed to Nationalist
occupation of that port. They said
they were prepared to fight.
North China Invaded
The invasion of North China in
force, with American assistance,
was the first major Kuo Min Tang
troops movements in this area. Ex
tensive fighting reported by Com
munist sources in Chungking actual
ly is only of skirmish intensity, ex
cept possibly along the Yangtze
river and in southern Chauntung.
