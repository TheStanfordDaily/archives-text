# Embryo Talk Will Be Today
## 
### 
Dr. Robert L. Bacon, instructor
in anatomy at Stanford, will speak
on "Experiments on the Heart in
Amphibian Embryos" at the Bio
logical Science department's week
ly seminar to be held this after
noon at 4:15 in Room 430 of Jordan
Hail.
Dr. Bacon did experiments on Ihe
hearts of amphibian embryos at Yale
University in 1043 and I!M4.
Embryologists' Problem
One of the main problems of the
embryologists is to determine why
any organ develops where it does
in a body, and what influence neigh
boring organs and tissues may have
in deciding what the organ is to
be like. As the heart is an organ
which is easily approached by means
of operation, experiments have been
done on it to get some information
on these factors.
Observations of normal develop
ment give no clues as (o the factors
that bring about the position and
shape of this organ. For this reason
experiments have been made on am
phibian embryos to determine these
"actors.
Tissue Removed
The tissue which normally de
velops into the heart is removed
from the body and cultured in small
glass chambers. The tissue continues
its development and gives rise to
hearts which beat as well as be
ing close to normal ones in struc
ture.
Mr. Bacon will show slides of
various hearts to illustrate his talk
on these experiments.
A tea will precede the seminar
at 4 p.m. Faculty, students, and
visitors arc invited to attend the
seminar.
