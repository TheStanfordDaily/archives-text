All was serene in the reserve book
room last night—the usual number
reading, the usual number sound
asleep—when a cloud of smoke
boiled up suddenly behind the radi
ator by the book stacks.
From the back of the room came
the shout, "It's going to explode,"
and the seats in the room were im
mediately stripped of students as a
wild stampede was made for the
door 'eading outside.
A "terrific" smell—a victim called
it that—permeated the Reserve
Book Room, filtered up tho stairs,
drove researchers in the lobby for
air. For half an hour academic
progress was halted in the down
stairs regions of the Library.
Why? Because some Hallowe'en
joke-artist had released a gopher
poison bomb behind the reserve
book room radiator.
