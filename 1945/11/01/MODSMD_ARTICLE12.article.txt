# Peppermint Ball Makes Hall History
## 
### 
History — peppermint-striped his
tory—will be made in the Branner
lobby Saturday evening from 9 to
1, according to Cathy Morris, Bran
ner social chairman. "Our closed
'Peppermint Lane' formal will be
the first formal ever held at Bran
ner," said Miss Morris, "and the
first dance in the lobby, since wom
en have been living at Branner."
The lobby entrance will resemble
a candy house, according to Linda
Hawley, head of the decoration
committee. Four enormous pepper
mint sticks—pillars in disguise—and
a candy man and woman on cither
side of the fireplace will be other
features of the decorations, .she
added.
Bert Whiting, his 10-piece orchcs-
Ira, and vocalist have been engaged
for the evening, stated Miss Morris,
and will be stationed in the lobby.
She added, however, that couples
may also dance in the open wings
extending from cither side of the
lobby. "Weather permitting," said
Miss Morris, "we'll open the doors
to the patio and the doors along the
front of Branner, so that couples
may dance out on the veranda."
Bids and programs have both been
designed with red peppermint
striped covers. Bids, in the shape
of peppermint sticks, arc being sold
for $2.50 by Branner corridor rep
resentatives, but may be purchased
only by women living in Branner,
according to Miss Morris.
"Not even the refreshments will
let couples forget, they're in 'Pep
permint Lane'," said Miss Morris.
She pointed out that peppermint ice
cream, cake with peppermint
striped frosting, and punch will be
served.
Committee heads in addition to
Miss Hawley arc as follows:
Alison Dice, bids; Ramona Grif
fith, music; Jean Stout, refresh
ments; Madelon Barrett, serving;
Phyllis Talmage, clean-up; Joan
Joaquin, tables; and Mary Ann Es
scr, patrons.
