A special prize lor the most orig
inal South Sea Island costume will
be given at Tyler's "Gardenia Lei,"
their autumn quarter all-campus
dance on Saturday from 9 to 1.
"Sport clothes and blue jeans are
fine," said President Willie Davies.
"but we would like to see some
really unique skirts and sarongs."
Ben Bok will lead his Kansas
City Five in latest smooth dance
hits well mixed with melody in the
tempo of Hawaii.
There will be ginger ale, root beer,
and a number of original refresh

famed for weekly firesides, the hall
will have two big fires going all
evening.
Tickets for this only open affair
