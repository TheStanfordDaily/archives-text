### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1)1 (Ul*). â€”Congress roared strong words hack
at President Truman today for the Chief Executive's two-fisted attack
on the legislators in liis wages-price policy speech last night.
Observe.s agreed that the first major fight between the White House
and the Capitol was on, and the reaction in Congress was that the former
Missouri Senator was going to he on the losing side.
From committee room and House floor came charges that the Presi
dent had been "unfair" in blaming two House committees for "damag
ing delays" with legislation to provide jobs-tor-all and jobless pay bene
fits. And there also was criticism of the speech itself. Most of it was
partisan, but some Democrats joined in defending the House Executive
Expenditures and the Ways and Means committees.
