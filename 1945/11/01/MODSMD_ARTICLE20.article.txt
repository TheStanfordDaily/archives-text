lias warned President Truman that discontent among German men is
rising and if widespread unemployment persists there is danger of or
ganized resistance to American occupation forces, it was announced

There have been sporadic outbreaks already, Eisenhower disclosed.
Eisenhower gave his warning in his Septmeher report to the Presi
dent on conditions in his occupation zone.
He disclosed that the danger of an uprising lay in growing resent

of the fraternization of American occupation troops with their wives,
sweethearts and the girls they would like to make wives or sweethearts.
Inactivity due to unemployment is an added factor.
