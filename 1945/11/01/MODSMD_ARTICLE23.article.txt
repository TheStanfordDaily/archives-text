QUESTION AND ANSWER GAME

YOUR A.S.S.U. CONSTITUTION
Criticism, il valid, can be constructive, or
at 1 oast revealing, but the trial constitution
under which the A.S.S.U. is now operating
seems to be getting more than its share of
baseless comment. Feeling that it's about time
some of those criticisms were laid open for
general student appraisal, we present them in
best "Dr. 1.Q." Style:
CRITICISM NUMBER ONE: Excom members,
under the constitution's area representation
plan, don't seem to be representing anyone, or
have difficulty in discovering just who their
constituents are. Cited as examples are: (1) the
Sequoia Hall representative; (2) the graduate
representative; (3) the non-area representative.
ANSWER NUMBER ONE: (1) Since Sequoia
Hall is now closed, its representative seems to
be without constituency. However, the Sequoia
Hall member was elected under the clause in
Article V, Section 4a, of the constitution stating
th; t "In an emergency, Executive Committee
m; y provide for not more than one additional
member to be elected as it shall deem neces
sary to make for just representation of the
members of this Association."
That "emergency," the fact that Sequoia did
not have a representative, has now passed. As
we have stated before, the inconsistency
could be remedied by electing or appointing,
in t place of the Sequoia Hall representative,
another member from the men's Row district
which has increased in population (also pro
vided for in the constitution); or, if qualified,
the present member in question can act for
the men's Row if enough of his constituents are
now living there.
(2) The graduate representative: This is the
one member of Excom elected "by the mem-
Lei s of the Association at large." She is pres
ent in semi-advisory capacity and does not nec
essarily have to represent graduate women
living in Hilltop House.
(3) The non-area representative: Illustrating
the flexibility of area representation, this Ex
com member logically represents Branner Hall,
the only large living group that would be with
out access to Excom.
CRITICISM NUMBER TWO: The advisability
of having freshman members on Excom, as
provided in the new plan. Arguments against
election of a man and woman freshman rep
resentative are mainly: (1) Two more mem
bers would make Excom "unwieldy." Answer:
Excom under the old constitution consisted of
11 members, plus ex-officio members. It was
noi considered unwieldy. Under the present
plan 12 is the maximum number of voting
Excom members.
(2) Freshmen "don't know anything about
school policy or Excom functions anyway."
Answer: Writers of the proposed constitution
(Excom members of last year) felt a definite
need for freshman members on Excom, if only
for the purpose of instructing them in school
policies and providing a channel through which
Excom could present its decisions to the fresh
man class. This would prevent recurrence of
any such incidents as that of last year when
the freshmen, not knowing definitely of Ex
r.om's ruling on no big name bands for the war
period, made plans which later had to be nul
lified in Excom meeting.
Il is true that the time lo recognize and dis
cuss any flaws in the constitution is now, while
it is operating subject to the approval of the
general student body. Before condemning
whole sections, however, critics should re
member that much hard v/ork and sound think
ing went into the framing of the new consti
tution. There are reasons—valid ones—for the
changes proposed. Recognizing the defects
in the "old system," Excom members last year
laid what they hoped would be a lasting foun
dation for a stronger, better balanced, more
capable and representative student govern
ment. Their work should not be changed with
out a like amount of effort and thought.
