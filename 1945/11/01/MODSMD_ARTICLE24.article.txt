Many of you probably have wondered why Lake
Lagunita is not kept open the year round. I have
pondered over that question many times myself.

By extensive research and study I finally found
the reason for it. You see. it was the frogs.
When Lake Lagunita first opened up it was on an
all year round basis. But then the frogs came and
complicated matters no end. At first it wasn't bad
because there was just one family of frogs. But then
a transient frog family came to California from Maine
for a visit one winter and stayed on the banks of
Lake Lagunita. They liked it so well they decided
to stay on. They sent for their belongings and set up
residence on the West bank of the Lake, just oppo
site the family which already was hero.
AH. LOVE!
Now that wasn't too bad, either. But one day a
couple of the members of the two families met and
an acquaintance was set up which wos due to spell
disaster.
You see, frogs are just like people. They like other
frogs and fall in love just like people. So pretty soon
one of the boy frogs and one of the girl frogs married.
It seemed like such a good idea that the other members
of the family started doine it too.
That was the beginning of the end. At first it wasn't
bad, but soon the frogs became so crowded on the
banks of Lake Lagunita that they started moving to
new habitats.
FROfiS IN THE SOUP!
Soon enough all kids of frogs were found in the
wash basins of Lagunita Court; they were found in
the bathtubs; they were found in the drain pipes,
and they were often found in the soup at lunch time.
But that was in the days of only 500 girls and they
had become used to standing most anything, so they
didn't say anything about the frogs.
The frogs became particularly popular when an
old Bull frog died, and in his will he said he wanted
his body to he given to the Stanford Biology De
partment as a cadaver with which to work. You see,
this Bull frog had a violent case of athlete's foot
whiih was very uncommon to frogs at that time. He
definitely played a large part in advancing medical
science.
Then there was the year of 1925, I believe it was,
when the frogs got together and organized a chorus.
They tell me that this was the only time in the history
of Stanford that Med School placed second in the
Spring Sing. But that had to stop too because the frog
chorus practiced at night and kept everyone awake.
ATHLETES, YET
There also was the year that the male frogs organ
ized and won the Fraternity Row Intramural Volley
ball Championship. They were great competitors.
But finally it had to come to an end. The Stan
ford Board of Trustees couldn't charge the frogs
room rent, or tuition, and yet (hey didn't want to
just throw them out of Lake Lagunita. One of the
brainier hoard members found a solution. He de
clared that Stanford should let out all (he water from
(he Lake in mid-June and everyone knows that
frogs can't live unless there is plenty of water.
But frogs are ingenious. They heard about Sears
ville Lake and decided that half of them would go
up there to live and the other half would stay on
here, just for the sake of tradition. So that's what
they did. A lot of the frogs didn't last the trip out,
but enough of them did to establish a small commun
ity. They, incidentally, are much respected in frog
circles because of their pioneering spirit.
But the happy thing about it is this: The two frog
clans never lost track of each other. There have even
been cases of inter-marriage between the two clans.
They are very happy.
Each year on the anniversary of that big frog mi
gration—June 21st —the two clans meet each other
half way between Searsville and Lake Lagunita and
have a conference and party together. They are very
happv. They even sent a delegate to the San Fran
cisco Conference last spring to lobby on the better
ment of frog and human relations.
And so everything has worked out well. It has
worked out well for Stanford and Lagunita, and it has
worked out well for the frogs. They are very happy.
I just thought you would like to know why Lake
Lagunita isn't open the year round. It was the frogs.
