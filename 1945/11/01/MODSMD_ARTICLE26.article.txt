To The Editor:
America is ON THE SPOT! In fact, if we are what
we like to think we are, it means that everyone of us
is ON THE SPOT. Either we must now "produce the
goods" or bow ourselves off the stage of world leader
ship. In 1 his Atomic Age we must act according to
the need, or face the consequences of indecision.
Leadership must ever grow with a crisis or die by its
failure to do so.
That is my sincere response to the paper by Nor
man Cousins. The Daily has rendered a significant
service to the students of Stanford in presenting
this challenge to us. Likewise in the lecture of Dr.
Eugene Staly on Atomic Bombs and International
Relations, we have had opportunity to hear what is
being thought or proposed. It has taken time for
(lie formulation of sound thinking regarding this
question of atomic energy. This discussion of the
issue is the best and most provocative I have yet
read. The question now is: What shall we do about
it?
If our pride in the greatness of America is real we
will desire to take the initiative in seeking an answer to
this common concern. History marks the rise of man
as Man. And for many years we have had the cour
age and good sense to say, "government for man—
not man for the government." Not only have we said
it; many Americans have died for it. Do we now
have the courage and moral stamina to advance that
proposition to being world wide? Are we willing to
relegate America to the position of statehood in favor
of a United World? True enough, in appearance we
would have less, but in truth we would have vastly
more.
If we fail to respond to this challenge, whatever
(ruth contained in it becomes meaningless except
the reality that man has lost—that he failed to rise
<o the occasion. Greatness has but one function and
that is to lead.
Furthermore, progressive reform in representative
government, or, a revolution so profound in scope as
this, ought, from its significance, arise within the ranks
of the common man. Our present leaders have not been
elected to do "this much business." Therefore, we,
the people, should decide whether they are capable of
it, and, if so, grant them the right to act in our behalf
and fpr the good of all. Just as a constitutional change
in our country requires the participating expression of
ail the American citizenry, so this revolutionary pro
posal for world government demands the attention and
enlistment of the world's citizens. Certainly, our
elected representatives are not apt to press for a solu
tion to this circumstance as seriously as they would
with our expressed desire for them to do so. That
expression could logically arise within the solleges and
universities of our country.
I propose that we, the students of Stanford, go on
record, and invite other universities to do so with
us, as desirous of promoting research and discussion
of the implications of the Atomic Age. On two oc
casions Stanford has offered her student body and
faculty "light" upon Ibis question. Let us mm re
