# William Durand Discusses Atomic World Prospect
## Emeritus Professor Says Atom Age Not in Sight; Bomb Should Be Banned in International Warfare 
### BOB PECK 
(The first of two articles dealing
ing with recent discoveries in
modern warfare as seen by Dr.
William F. Durand, emeritus
professor.)

"I can't see the prospect of an
atomic world in any future time
which can possibly be talked about,"
Dr. William F. Durand, 86 year old
emeritus professor says.
Thus the hope for an atomic
world with steamships being run on
a glassful of power and automo
biles run on a thimble of released
atoms is a far distant thing.
"We are a long way from reali
zation of how to harness the
atomic power," Dr. Durand said.
"So far the only use we have
been able to apply the power to
is explosives," he added.
The enthusiasm which prevailed at
the time of the unveiling of the
bomb and the glorious plans for an
atomic world were premature. "We
are far away from harnessing the
power for commercial purposes or
for any purposes," the emeritus pro
cessor s;aid.

Having read the comments of ad
ministration and faculty members on
the atomic bomb in Monday's Daily,
Dr. Durand ventured to say that
"the bomb should be outlawed in
international warfare."
"We can't hope to keep the bomb
secret. Foreign elements know the
basic theory of it now," the doc
tor said.
"The actual construction of the
bomb is only one realization of its
possibilities. We could keep secret
our design of making the bomb, but
the engineers of foreign countries
could develop a like bomb," Dr.
Durand added emphatically.
These facts indicate that the Unit
ed States is not in a position to
keep the bomb secret even if it
wanted to, for foreign countries,
working on the basic theory, could
quickly develop a similar weapon.
"The Germans were working on
the bomb at the time the war
ended for them. They were far
away from perfecting it simply
becausc they lacked the resources
and facilities that we have." he
added.
The Japanese were working on it

too but got led off in a different di
rection. They were even farther
away than the Germans in the reali
zation of atomic power," the 8(1 year
old doctor said.
In explaining the release of atomic
energy, Dr. Durand said that the
immediate release of atomic energy
is in heat. Therefore, early results
would indicate, that any practical
usss which the bomb might have
would have to be in connection with
an engine. Possibly, a steam engine
with the atomic power taking the
place of steam, the doctor said.
The New Mexico explosion of
the bom I) surprised I)r. Durand in
its intensity. The doctor had
known about the studies on the
bomb and about the experiments
being conducted, but he was sur
prised that the explosion released
so much power. He had always
realized the potential power of
the bomb but nobody knew just
how much power could be re
leased by such an explosion.
The 8G year old emeritus profes
sor returned recently from Wash
ington where he has been at work
for lour years on the jet propulsion
bomb. A discussion of Dr. Durand's
activities in jet propulsion work will
be found in the second article of
this series in today's Daily.

known about the studies on the
bomb and about the experiments
being conducted, but he was sur
prised that the explosion released
so much power. He had always
realized the potential power of
the bomb but nobody knew just
how much power could be re
leased by such an explosion.
The 8G year old emeritus profes
sor returned recently from Wash
ington where he has been at work
for lour years on the jet propulsion
bomb. A discussion of Dr. Durand's
activities in jet propulsion work will
be found in the second article of
this series in today's Daily.
(The first of two articles dealing

modern warfare as seen by Dr.
William F. Durand, emeritus
professor.)

"I can't see the prospect of an
atomic world in any future time
which can possibly be talked about,"
Dr. William F. Durand, 86 year old
emeritus professor says.
Thus the hope for an atomic
world with steamships being run on
a glassful of power and automo
biles run on a thimble of released
atoms is a far distant thing.
"We are a long way from reali
zation of how to harness the
atomic power," Dr. Durand said.
"So far the only use we have
been able to apply the power to
is explosives," he added.
The enthusiasm which prevailed at
the time of the unveiling of the
bomb and the glorious plans for an
atomic world were premature. "We
are far away from harnessing the
power for commercial purposes or
for any purposes," the emeritus pro
cessor s;aid.

Having read the comments of ad
ministration and faculty members on
the atomic bomb in Monday's Daily,
Dr. Durand ventured to say that
"the bomb should be outlawed in
international warfare."
"We can't hope to keep the bomb
secret. Foreign elements know the
basic theory of it now," the doc
tor said.
"The actual construction of the
bomb is only one realization of its
possibilities. We could keep secret
our design of making the bomb, but
the engineers of foreign countries
could develop a like bomb," Dr.
Durand added emphatically.
These facts indicate that the Unit
ed States is not in a position to
keep the bomb secret even if it
wanted to, for foreign countries,
working on the basic theory, could
quickly develop a similar weapon.
"The Germans were working on
the bomb at the time the war
ended for them. They were far
away from perfecting it simply
becausc they lacked the resources
and facilities that we have." he
added.
The Japanese were working on it

too but got led off in a different di
rection. They were even farther
away than the Germans in the reali
zation of atomic power," the 8(1 year
old doctor said.
In explaining the release of atomic
energy, Dr. Durand said that the
immediate release of atomic energy
is in heat. Therefore, early results
would indicate, that any practical
usss which the bomb might have
would have to be in connection with
an engine. Possibly, a steam engine
with the atomic power taking the
place of steam, the doctor said.
The New Mexico explosion of
the bom I) surprised I)r. Durand in
its intensity. The doctor had
known about the studies on the
bomb and about the experiments
being conducted, but he was sur
prised that the explosion released
so much power. He had always
