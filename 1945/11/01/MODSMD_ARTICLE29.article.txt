### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 31 (UP). — A
"realistic fight" between labor and
management in the steel industry—
and resulting industry paralysis—
was the gloomy prediction made to
day by an authoritative trade jour
ilfil. ♦
The magazine "Iron Age" warned
that the steel industry faced its
first general walkout in many years
after steel employes' strike ballots
are counted within the next few
weeks.
Hope for a clear government policy
to forestall nation-wide strikes in
major industries "may be wishful
thinking as far as actually prevent
ing an impasse" between labor and
management, the magazine said.
The first expeditionary force in the
history of Mexico is a fighter squad
ron trained in Texas under lend
lease.
