# 'Our Vines' Judged Artistic Tear-Jerker
## 
### 
"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes,"
opening today at the Stanford, is a
bit of sentimental fluff whipped up

by M-G-M to en
tertain. Surpris
ingly enough, it
does just that.
Material that
could have lapsed
the production
into a sweet lit
tle tear-jerker is
fortunately han
dled with taste.
Scenes of the

Wisconsin winter; pretended sur
prise at Christmas; the coming of
the circus into town, all interest us
in* their realism. We have been led
to take a negative viewpoint on mo
tion pictures, and art in production
is an unexpected pleasure.
Maggie Comes Through
Even when the going gets tough,
little Margaret O'Brien is there to
pull it through and we liked old
Eddie Robinson as an itinerant Wis
consin farmer. Agnes Moorhead, of
"Sorry, Wrong Number" radio fame,
is the first believable movie mother
we've seen since Fay Holden and
Fay Bainter started boosting Kleen
ex t.aies.

The story's plot loses momentum
and the scenes in which Margaret
O'Brien and little "Butch" Jenkins
get lost in the flood should be cut.
But the producers didn't try to come
forth with an action picture; they've
fortunately relied on characteriza
tion and common-place incidents to
build their "American picture."
Orchids for Butch
Humorous little "Butch" Jenkins
deserves plaudits for everything he
does. The scene in which his face
is pressed against the school-room
window is a classic. Also mark the
skating scenes which he steals from
venerable scene-stealer Margaret
O'Brien.
Young Man's Fancy
James Craig is there to gush up
the usual romance with the usual
pretty school-teacher, Frances Gif
ford in this case, but you can go
out for a smoke the few minutes
they're on the screen.
Reminding one of M-G-M's earl
ier "The Human Comedy," the new
production rarely fails in human
interest. Only in the scenes that
follow movie formula—where the
fresh originality of the production
is lost—will "Our Vines Have Tend
er Grapes" disappoint.—Bob Peck.
