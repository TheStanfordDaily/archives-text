# Weird, Winsome Witches Haunt Here Hallowe'en
## 
### B. WITCHING 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Hal
loween, any time after 10:30. —We've
got 'em behind their bars until 8
tomorrow morning. Now for some
fun.
There's a terrific wind, water's
flooding all over the jernt, the
palms of quadrioco are making mu
sic with the grapefruit—and don't
deny it, 'cause you weren't there—
or do y' want a lock-out, you witch?
We're holding our annual con
vention out among the stacks—hay
lor those with waterproofed sheets,
libe for others. Well, here's our big
trouble: Most of the girls don't have
dates. Y' know how it is during
abnormal times, any old devil ex
pects you to wear plates on dates,
grind down your claws, and do all
these other demanding little things.
But we've got our morals and our
creed and stuff, and we girls have
found that it's just as much fun to
let the devils gotahell and bat
around alone. But you've gotta
have a man for the Halloween con
vention.

So, the entertainment chairman
says, it's okay if wp raid a grave
yard. She doesn't have any games
planned, anyway. Trouble is, Paly
people look all right in red and
green—Paly High, fight, fight—but,
chees, they're unattractive in sheets.
One of the girls picked up an aw
fully nice gravedigger there, though.
He went for her combination broom,
shovel, and ciaw sharpener in a big
way.
Then we picks up the Frenchman
of the tower (no, I ain't crazy, I just
don't like corners) for someone else.
From there, the going gets rough,
but we have to get back to our con
vention. Our fleet sweeps up a
street sort of near the stacks—l
think the weirds call it campus.
There are houses—some big, some
little — with things wandering
around them. They're wearing blue
overall things, sort of like the ones
the scarecrow I took to the con
vention last year wore, but he had
so much backbone.
There's no time to waste, though,
so we steal some pumpkins and
throw 'em over the creatures' heads.
They really aren't so bad. Almost
like men.
To knife this thing short, we're
back at the convention goblin the
refreshment committee, and up
comes this free-wheeling job in
blue. He says something about quiet
hours Qnd takes us for a ride.
It's 8 in the morning, and the
weirds are on the loose again, we're
barred for the season. Chees. the
least they could do is throw us a few
bones, so we could start grinding
out some refreshments for the next
convention.
