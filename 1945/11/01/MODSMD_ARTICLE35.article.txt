The Horn Disappoints
Maybe it's too much publicity.
Maybe it's the lure of commercial
ism. Maybe it's Betty Grabble. But
whatever the reason is, the Harry
James crew has suffered because of
it. Playing at the San Francisco Civ
ic Auditorium, the Horn disappoint
ed the thousands who had come to
see "the greatest trumpeter in the
world" perform. Featuring Kitty
Kallen, who is leaving the band No
vember 1, and Buddy DiVito on vo
cals, the band dragged themselves
through the usual, stock, hit parade
tunes, most of which were plugs for
songs James has recorded recently.
The only bright spot of the evening
was the featuring of Willie Smith on
a great many numbers. Smith, one
of the greatest alto-sax men in
Swingdom, was a welcome relief to
the brassy noise the Music Makers
were causing.
James, blowing his usual heavy
vibrato style of trumpet, proved once
and for all that he saw his best days
when playing in the Goodman group.
A disappointment to same Jazz en
thusiasts was the absence of tenor
man Corky Corvoran whose truancy
was not explained to the curious
audience. Another highlight of the
festivities was the performance of
Juan Tizol, slip-horn artist deluxe,
on (he old favorite, "St. Louis Blues."
Tizol, former Ellington sideman, has
improved his technique but has come
down in company during the past
few years.
History of Jazz
With "The History of Jazz" as an
overall title, Capitol Recording Com
pany has recently come up with the
most comprehensive recorded history
of the swing scene that has ever
been compiled in one set of platters
The Big Three in the field of popular
music has now become the Big Four
as this company joins the ranks ol
Victor, Decca, and Columbia; all ol
whom have issued or reissued some
group of discs which attempt to pre
sent the history of Jazz in a nut
shell.
Instead of doing the expected, Dave
Dexter, Capitol's Jazz expert, gath
ered together some of the country's
leading exponents of the Jazz idion
and attempted to recreate the musk
of old rather than dig into the files
and bring forth some old badly re
corded masters. Forty sides divided
into four albums at $4.25 each com
prise the set, although Victor coule
not get away with that price for their
Hot Jazz Series, the quality of these
records should make them sell.
Solid South
In the first album entitled "The
Solid South" a successful effort. w.'i. c
made to recreate the music of old
Storyville in New Orleans. With
Barney Bigard leading the way, the
group of musicians cut some old
standards such as "High Society" and
"Sister Kate" and even waxed some
new tunes played in the old style
With Leadbelly starling the album
on its way, it really signs off jump
ing when some of the former Boh
Crosby Bobcats get together for i
nice "At the Jazzband Ball."
In between these sides we find e
rather good expression of the ole
"Dixieland" style of Jazz. A trie
composed of Zutty Singleton, Free
Washington, and Mr. Bigard knock
off some good numbers, and ther
with Eddie Miller and Wingy Ma
none featured, the former Bobcat:
ride the album out with some enjoy
able listening. No doubt, the ab
sence of Kid Ory & Co., will disap
point many, but the lovers of thi:
type of music should get a kick ou
of these discs.
