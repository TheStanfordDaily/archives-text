## SIDELINE SLANTS 
### Bob Slobe 
Bill Cowden, first string guard in the Pollard, Burness, Voss,
Dallmar era in Stanford basketball history, was back on campus
yesterday. After watching Bill scrimmage with the team for a
while, we knew why the Indian team of '41 copped the N.C.AA.
title in that year, winning three games in the championship
playoffs.
COWDEN TOPS
Bill afforded excellent testimony for the success of Coach
i Everett Dean's team that year. He ran through the plays in Dean's
tricky offense without a hitch; almost as if he had never left the
floor since his college days. "Miss" did not seem to be in hand
some Bill's vocabulary—his shot were never very far off from
any distance.
Squad members who were trying to master the intricacies of
Dean's five man weave offense were infinitely grateful to Bill for
his able assistance in showing them how. There are dozens
of basketball mentors that would give a great deal to obtain the
services of Bill Cowden for their team —would that he were only
eligible to play for Stanford.
TEAM IMPROVES
The basketball team in general seems to be improving a great
deal, with Dave Brown, Joe Owen, Bill Christianson, Tom Hood,
and Max King looking pretty good out there. Dean has not as
yet divided the team up into squads, and he still has available
Navy talen to use. Fordy Anderson is working with the Navy
men now, and Fordy, who was coach of the year last season
while at Great Lakes, looks like the leading candidate for as
sistant coach.
Dean has not made his second cut yet, but he will probably
take this step soon in order to get the team down to working
size. Dean's prime interest now is to get the squad into a posi
tion where the members of the squad get used to playing with
each other—his system excludes individualism too. So you can
see that we really haven't had a chance to see any "hot shots"
on the floor yet. Coach Dean has taught the bays basketball
just like a professor would teach a language course, beginning
with the simplest fundamentals and working up, and meanwhile
taking care to explain each step carefully before going on to the
next step.
INDIANS RETURN
Our football game November 10 should draw a large crowd
of Stanford students. It will certainly be one way of telling
v/hether the Stanford spirit of old has really died out. I know
it seems strange to me when I realize that I am really a sopho
more and have never seen a Cardinal aggregation on the field.
Another Indian great was helping out a week or so ago. His
name is Ed Stamm, lineman on Stanford's last Rose Bowl team
and former A.S.S.U. president. Ed gave Marchie Schwartz able
assistance in line coaching, and he, too, was still able to show the
new recruits how.
Let us hope that Stanford again will attain a reputation that
v/ill be feared by all colleges.
