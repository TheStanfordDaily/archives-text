# Mural Play In Final Week
## 
### 
Intra-mural football comes into
the homestretch this week. The
season started out with great en
thusiasm and support from all the
men's halls, but the six man touch
game has sort of fizzled out the last
part of the season. The reason be
ing that a goodly majority of the
pigskin toters transferred to varsity
football under Marchie Schwartz.
The League I champions are the
Kappa-Dee Gee hashing combina
tion. These boys developed a pol
ished attack and wound up the sea
son in fine fettle.
In League II a, final tilt between
Encina 2 and the Hilltoppers will
be necessary to see who the top
men are. Both the freshmen men of
Encina and the campus "old-tim
ers" at the top of the hill have
worked out flashy plays, and the
final tilt between the boys will
no mean affair.
The number 111 league features
the offerings of Army and Medics
111. This, too, will be a rip-snort
ing affair, and if you can spare your
most valuable time from studying,
hop over to the football field and
root for on 9 of these teams.
