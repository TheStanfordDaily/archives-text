# Army-Navy May Battle in Stadium
## Army Grid Squad Crippled By Knee Injury of Theis 
### 
The Army's chances of winning the Army-Navy grid tussle looked
a little slimmer yesterday, when two of their men were sidelined with
injuries that will probably keep them both out of the game to be played
Saturday at 2:15. It has been reported that Theis, captain and star of
the army six, is out due to a knee injury, and Davis, another Army
♦star, is also on the bench with an

arm ailment.
A.S.S.U. President Bob Kennedy
has announced that an attempt has
been made to obtain the Stanford
Stadium to play the game in. One
practical offshoot of the idea is the
fact that if enough students at
tend this game, Rally Com can
practice yells with the students,
and thus tune-up for the forth
coming tilt with the Stockton
Commandos.
If there is enough spirit and in
terest shown in this game one can
be assured that, there will be plenty
on November 10.
The game will hp played on a
field 80 yards long and 40 yards
wide. This leaves plenty of room
for sweeping end runs; so there
ought to be plenty of thrills for all
who attend.
