# SLANTING SIDELINES
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Stanford Indians went through
(heir first big scrimmage yesterday
afternoon. Four teams ran through
plays against each other, with dif
ferent backfield combinations al
ternating with each other. The
boys showed a lot of pep and hubba
hubba, but their enthusiasm was far
greater than their football ability.
The lines didn't know the plays very
well, and the backs were slow in
reeling off their plays. Considering
the fact that only one hour every
day has been allotted to football
practice, maybe not more should
be expected from the boys.
More Practice Needed
Coach Schwartz—far from dis
couraged — believes a little more
practice will iron the sore spots that
showed up yesterday. The head grid
man wants the backfield men to
polish up on their offense, with the
quarterbacks in particular showing
more speed and deception. Also—
the touchdown makers of the team
will have to improve on their tack
ling. Very few clean-cut tackles
were made yesterday afternoon,
with the exception of Marshall Hjcl
tc, who did some fancy tackling that
caught the eye of this writer.
No starting backfield has been set
yet, but a fair working combina
tion was seen in Tom Ashley and
Martin at the halfback posts, Fred
Willey plunging from full, and
Knight operating the quarterback
spot in the T formation. Knight's
passing, in particular, has caught the
eye of sideline gazers.
Better Linemen
Neither has the first line been se
lected yet, but a few of the boys
showing more than average prom
ise are Del Torkelson, a Navy boy
who has had some collegiate back
ground at Kansas State College, and
Joe Babich, a transfer from St.
Mary's, who also has been shining

in early practices. At the center slot
big Bob Abrams looks like a col
lege varsity man. I?ic Supple, who
is better than a country player at
punting, is trying for an end post.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has al
most for sure decided not to line
up any contest for Nov. 10. Only
about eight hours of practice re
main till that date, and the mentor
doesn't feel that the squad will be
in proper shape to compete against
a seasoned opponent that has al
ready heard the referee's whistle
this season.
The following week. Nov. 17, a
fray has been arranged with the
Stockton Commandos. Very little
is known about that team, except
that our own Indian eleven will
have a run for their money in that
contest. The -Stockton Air Base ag
gregation has experience to its cred
it, if not talent. We'll try to get some
"dope" on that team, and will pass
it along when it comes in.
No game will be played on the
24th of this month because of the
Thanksgiving recess. But on the
following Satuday, the San Mateo
Merchant Marines invade the Stan
ford stadium. By that time, our
outfit should be a smooth-working
team, and the game ought to develop
into a slam-bang affair, San Mateo
being no slouches in the manly art
of football.
