# Navy's Three Teams Now Ready for Tilt with AST
## 
### 
Lt. Hal. Williams, athletic officer for the Naval R.O.T.C. Unit, an
nounced yesterday that he has accepted the challenge offered by the
ASTP's championship touch football squad. The game is scheduled to
take place this coming Saturday at 1400 (2:00 p.m. to you) in the sunken
diamond. Lt. Williams has organized three teams for the event and

optomistically predicts a Naval
victory.
The probable starting line-up
for the Navy will include Boles
at halfback, Larson at quarterback,
Martin, (Captain) at fullback,
Hendershott and Varner at ends,
and Williamson at center. Knight
and several other outstanding
Navy men will undoubtedly see
action, if the results of dental
â€¢ surgery wear off in time for the
game.
Saturday's game will be the Navy's
first opportunity to compete against
a team other than their own and
should be the start of a very active
athletic program for the Navy at
Stanford. Some plans that are al
ready being considered include
basketball games with other groups,
and in the not too distant future
smokers where wrestling and box
ing matches will be the featured at
tractions, with comedy skits and
various other talented acts on the
program.
