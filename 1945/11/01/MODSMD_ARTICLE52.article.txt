# New Director Bean Says Stanford Press Success
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
"The Stanford University Press
has been one of the most success
ful of University presses in spite
of its late start, Donald P. Bean,
new director of the press said.
According to Mr. Bean, the press
has the opportunity to assume the
Pacific Coast leadership in its field.
It prints everything except fiction
and juvenile books. Most of the
authors of the books printed are
Stanford or regional scholars.
Managed Chicago Press
Mr. Bean became director Au
gust 1. He first came to Stanford
last April and made a survey of
the press and a report for Donald
13. Tresidder, president of Stanford.
He was manager of the University
of Chicago Press from 1927 to 1942.
He started working there in 1918, one
year after his graduation from the
University of Chicago. In addition
to his publishing activities, he was
director of the University's fiftieth
anniversary fund-raising campaign
in 1942.
Worked in Williamsburg
On leave from the University of
Chicago from 1942 to 1944, he was
director in interpretation for the
Rockefeller project at Williams

burg. Virginia, studying ways in
which the American history learned
through the reconstructed colonial
village could be made known to
the world. He was in charge of
hostesses, publishing, and making
movies.
Mr. Bean is also publisher of "The
Educational Screen," a visual edu
cation journal, and will continue
his interest in that field.
Press Can Expand
Stanford's press now is about the
size of Chicago's when I first went
there," Mr. Bean commented. "But
it has a great chance to expand.
Chicago started its press the day
the University was founded, and
Stanford's press wasn't started un
til .1825."
Book on Rubber
"An interesting sidelight is that
the first issue of the Stanford Daily,
then the Daily Palo Alto, printed
an editorial welcoming the Uni
versity of Chicago which was found
ed that day," Mr. Bean continued.

The two schools began just a year
apart.
The next book to be issued by the
Stanford Press will be "Rubber and
its Regulations," a publication of the
food research institute by K. E.
Knorr of Stanford. It will come
out November 8.
"The Press also gives students a
chance for valuable experience by
working on the Daily and coining
into contact with the business of
journalism and printing, he said.
Color Work
Recently the press has been doing
a great deal of color work. It prints
the covers for the Alumni Review,
the pictures for the Cap and Gown
calendars, and printed the pictures
of Stanford in the 1944-45 Quad. This
work is done by the offset process
which is used widely but not very
often for color. The Cap and Gown
calendar pictures and the Quad pic
tures wore dong by the dual-color
process so that they come out as
tinted photographs.
