# German V Bombs Could Have Beaten England---Durand
## 
### BOB PECK 
"If the Germans had discovered
the V-l and V-2 bombs earlier in
the war, during the air blitz years
of 1941 and 1942, they would have
made it very uncomfortable for
England," Emeritus Professor Wil
liam F. Durand said.
"It is doubtful whether the Eng
lish could have held out if the Ger
mans had perfected these weapons
and had manufactured large quanti
ties of them early in the war," the
86 year-old jet-propulsion expert
said.
Too Late
As it was they didn't use them in
great quantities until 1944 and 1945
and by that time the American and
British offensive in Europe was on.
"The V-l and V-2 bombs couldn't
have made any headway against
the United States, though," the doc
tod added. "Possibly if Germany had
been able to knock England out
of the war, the war would have
ended in a U.S.-German stalemate."
Supply Base
Certainly the occupation of Eu
rope without an England in which
to base supplies would have put
the United States at a bad disad
vantage, Dr. Durand said.
The veteran Stanford research
worker has just returned from
Washington after four years as
chairman of the National Advis
ory Council for Aeronautics.
Jet Propulsion
Dr. Durand was charged with or
ganizing jet propulsion activities for
the army and navy. Under war
conditions, the doctor worked with
problems of the flight of the bomb.
"The idea of jet propulsion is as
old as the idea for rockets itself

but the realization of using jet
propulsion in bombs is new," he said.
Commended by Truman
Professor Durand has been inter
ested in jet propulsion since 1916.
He has done considerable research
on the subject and only came out
of retirement to do government
wox-k at the request of the late Pre
sident Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Upon his resignation as a mem
ber of the Aei'onautics council, Dr.
Durand received a letter from Presi
dent Harry Truman which said that
"you organized with eminent suc
cess the research and development
program in the important new field
of jet-propulsion."
V-l Inaccurate
In discussing the difference be
tween the German V-l and V-2
bombs, Dr. Durand said that the
V-l did not have much accuracy
because it went on rocket power
alone and when this energy was all
used up, the bomb would drop.
Of course the accuracy of the V-l
bomb was very poor and the Ger
mans were unable to hit sought
after targets.
Jet and Commerce
In the V-2 bomb, though, the
misslc was hurled from a platform.
It was given a boost from this plat
form by a rocket, and when the
rocket power was all used up, a
turbine engine took over. This tur
bine engine burned fuel and took
air from the outside. In burning
fuel, it could go as far as the fuel
took it.
Stanford Research
Asked particularly whether he
thought that jet-propulsion could
be used in commercial flight planes,
the doctor said, "It doesn't seem
possible that at this stage of the
game jet propulsion can be used in
airplanes. The theory only applies
for high altitudes and high velocity
and this definitely doesn't apply to
modern aircraft.*'
Research work for the jet-pro
pulsion bomb was done here at
Stanford. The aeronautics laboratory
is equipped with a wind tunnel
and other facilities with which Dr.
Durand carried on his research.
During his stay in Washington,
the doctor worked in the offices of
the National Advisory Board of
Aeronautics. It was for his work in
the jet-propulsion field that Dr.
Durand will receive the ASME
award on November 28.

conditions, the doctor worked with
problems of the flight of the bomb.
"The idea of jet propulsion is as
old as the idea for rockets itself

but the realization of using jet
propulsion in bombs is new," he said.
Commended by Truman
Professor Durand has been inter
ested in jet propulsion since 1916.
He has done considerable research
on the subject and only came out
of retirement to do government
wox-k at the request of the late Pre
sident Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Upon his resignation as a mem
ber of the Aei'onautics council, Dr.
Durand received a letter from Presi
dent Harry Truman which said that
"you organized with eminent suc
cess the research and development
program in the important new field
of jet-propulsion."
V-l Inaccurate
In discussing the difference be
tween the German V-l and V-2
bombs, Dr. Durand said that the
V-l did not have much accuracy
because it went on rocket power
alone and when this energy was all
used up, the bomb would drop.
Of course the accuracy of the V-l
bomb was very poor and the Ger
mans were unable to hit sought
after targets.
Jet and Commerce
In the V-2 bomb, though, the
misslc was hurled from a platform.
It was given a boost from this plat
form by a rocket, and when the
rocket power was all used up, a
turbine engine took over. This tur
bine engine burned fuel and took
air from the outside. In burning
fuel, it could go as far as the fuel
took it.
Stanford Research
Asked particularly whether he
thought that jet-propulsion could
be used in commercial flight planes,
the doctor said, "It doesn't seem
possible that at this stage of the
game jet propulsion can be used in
airplanes. The theory only applies
for high altitudes and high velocity
and this definitely doesn't apply to
modern aircraft.*'
Research work for the jet-pro
pulsion bomb was done here at
Stanford. The aeronautics laboratory
is equipped with a wind tunnel
and other facilities with which Dr.
Durand carried on his research.
During his stay in Washington,
the doctor worked in the offices of
the National Advisory Board of
Aeronautics. It was for his work in
the jet-propulsion field that Dr.
Durand will receive the ASME
award on November 28.
"If the Germans had discovered
the V-l and V-2 bombs earlier in
the war, during the air blitz years
of 1941 and 1942, they would have
made it very uncomfortable for
England," Emeritus Professor Wil
liam F. Durand said.
"It is doubtful whether the Eng
lish could have held out if the Ger
mans had perfected these weapons
and had manufactured large quanti
ties of them early in the war," the
86 year-old jet-propulsion expert
said.
Too Late
As it was they didn't use them in
great quantities until 1944 and 1945
and by that time the American and
British offensive in Europe was on.
"The V-l and V-2 bombs couldn't
have made any headway against
the United States, though," the doc
tod added. "Possibly if Germany had
been able to knock England out
of the war, the war would have
ended in a U.S.-German stalemate."
Supply Base
Certainly the occupation of Eu
rope without an England in which
to base supplies would have put
the United States at a bad disad
vantage, Dr. Durand said.
The veteran Stanford research
worker has just returned from
Washington after four years as
chairman of the National Advis
ory Council for Aeronautics.
