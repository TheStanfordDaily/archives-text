# Bacon Talks On Anatomy Experiments
## 
### 
"Experiments on the Heart in
Amphibian Embryos" was the topic
of the illustrated lecture given by
Dr. Robert L. Bacon, instructor in
anatomy at Stanford, at the Bio
logical Science department's week
ly seminar held yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Bacon performed these ex
periments at Yale University in
1043 and 1944. The study of heart
development provides information
on problems of the shape and place
of organs in the body. Dr. Bacon
did his experiments on the hearts
of amphibian embryos.
Tissue was removed from the or
ganism before being developed in
to a heart to form an organ outside
of the body. The heart rudiment
was removed and kept in a salt
solution. It grew into a heart which
was typical, but somewhat smaller
than normal hearts. The middle of
gastrulation is the earliest time that
tissue can be removed and still form
a heart. This seems evident since
tissue removed before this time did
not form hearts.
A second type of experimentation
was made to investigate the asym
metry in an organ. The gut floor,
located above the heart, was re
moved. The two rudiments of the
heart tried to unite, but they did
not pass the point of operation. So,
each rudiment developed separately.
If one of the two failed to de
velop it was the right section. The
left rudiment is dominant in normal
development since it imposes its
rate of beat and curative upon the
right one.
Experiments were also made to
determine the importance of sur
rounding tissue in bringing about
normal development of the heart.
Some of the tissue near the heart
exerts organizing effect on the
mesederm to bring about complete
development.
The heart arises as two separate
rudiments which receive initial or
ganization in the middle of gastru
lation. The tissues migrate to meet
and fuse on the ventral side of the
embryo, and complete their develop
ment under organizing action of the
gut.
"Australia's Great Barrier Reef"
will be the subject of an illustrated
lecture by Theodore C. Roughley,
Superintendent of Fisheries of New
South Wale, Australia, at the Little
Theater in Memorial Hall tomorrow
at 4:15.
