# 'Venus Fixers' Preserve Art
## 
### 
"The G.l.'s called the monuments
officers in charge of preserving and
repairing art trophies in war areas
'Venus Fixers' because of the na
ture of their work," explained Pro
fessor William B. Dinsmoor of Co
lumbia University in his lecture last
night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Mr. Dinsmoor declared that there
were two types of work done. One
was storing and covering art works
in various ways.
The principal work of the Amer
ican and British committees was
drawing maps and compiling in
formation concerning the location
of various masterpieces. Approxi
mately 800 maps were made of loca
tions in Europe and the Pacific re
gion. The information was gathered
from newspapers of enemy and oc
cupied countries, records in the
Smithsonian Institution, the Library
of Congress and other sources.
The talk was illustrated wilh
slides of monuments, showing the
condition before and after bomb
ings, the precautions taken before
the fighting began and the work
done to restore them to pre-war
condition, as well as maps used by
Allied troops.
