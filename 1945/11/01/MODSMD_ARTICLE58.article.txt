# Japanese Played Part In Revolt in Java---Herre
## Minority Backs New Outbursts 
### MEG THOMAS 
"I am firmly convinced that the
Japanese have played a large part
in organizing the current Javanese
revolt," states Albert Herre, Cura
tor of Ichthyology and noted au
thority on the Southern Pacific and
East Indian islands.
Mr. Herre believes that the re
volt of the Javanese people is not
a spontaneous outburst, and does
not represent the majority of the
inhabitants of the Dutch East In
dies.
Sacarno Represents Small Portion
He said that "only a small, high
ly vociferous group of men from
Java and Sumatra are clamoring for
independence while perhaps 95 per
cent of the inhabitants have no
conception of the issues involved,
or even the principles of the strug
gle. The people of Java are di
vided into the Madurese, Sundan
ese, and Javanese, and have very
little contact with each other. Sa
carno, the head of the revolt, and
his followers represent but a very
small portion of the population who
have education and ambition but do
not occupy Government jobs. Sa
carno, moreover, was the puppet
head of Java during the Japanese
occupation. It is not at all improb
able that he will meet the same end
that Laval and Quisling have met.
Mr. Herre points out that: "in
view of the facts that the Dutch
Colonial policy has always fostered
liberal Javanese participation in
their government, Sacarno has no
means of providing an immediate
working government; and that a
great part of the Dutch East In
dies is made up of primitive peoples,
including cannibals, who are obliv
ious to the meaning or workings of
independence; I have no doubt that
the revolution will fail.
Anticipates Dutch Liberalization
"Of course, it is true that the
Dutch policy has had numerous
flaws, but the Dutch' authorities
have stated that conditions will be
changed and improved; therefore I
anticipate a further liberalization in
peacetime," he concluded.
Mr. Herre is now working in Na
tural History research department
on the classification of fishes from
the coast of Texas. He prefers to
be called 'Curator of Fishes' rather
than the official 'Curator of Ichthy
ology,' because people know what

you mean that way."
Pacific Travels
He has an extensive background
of work in the Pacific and has
travelled in Borneo, Tahiti, Samoa,
New Guinea, the Philippines, Su
matra, India, and most of the major
islands of the southern Pacific. He
has just completed assembling a col
lection of fishes from the Malay
Peninsula, Burma, and India that
he brought back from his latest ex
plorations in 1940 and 1941.
During his travels, Mr. Herre has
visited many noted people, among
them Charles NordhofT, the famous
co-author of "Mutiny on the Boun
ty," "Hurricane," and "Botany
Bay."

He was formerly in charge of fish
eries in the Philippines under the
Philippines government.
