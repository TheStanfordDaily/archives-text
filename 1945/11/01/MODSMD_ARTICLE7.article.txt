# 1945 Quad 'Excels in Artwork, Research, Photograph Choice'
## 
### 
Wine and green and read all over
campus was the 1945 Stanford Quad

which yesterday made its tardy ap- ■
pearance and moved a reluctant j
student body to admit that the year
book was well worth the waiting.
Despite faulty photography in parts
and inconsistency in details, the
excellent research of the picture
staff, the fortunate choice of campus
"prominents," and the inspiration
of some of its artists placed the
Quad far above the average in war- j
i.imc yearbooks.
The Quad was formally dedicated
to retiring registrar John P. Mitchell,
but few students who read it
through did not have the feeling
that this volume belonged to Dick
Driscoll, former student body presi
dent who died October 2 as the re
sult of an auto accident. The ex
cellent color display and student
in-action poses on the division pages
rated secondary notice as readers
recognizcd "Drisc" tying his tie and
painting the puppet of the Old Boy.
Last year's staff photographer was
apparently omnipresent, for he
turned up in the high voltage lab
oratory. outside the chapel on V-E |
day, and with winter quarter's ,
skiers at Yosemite. We understood |
why not, but we certainly wish
there had been more of the same.
Pat Pierce's cartoons —especially |

the sludy in Stanford legs—and the
borders done by Ed McLellan were
tops artistically. The dignified, full
page pictures of the Quad Queens
gave appropriate display to some of
Stanford's most beautiful.
The cover papers of Stanford
seals carried forward the cover de
sign, and lead right into a some
what pointless pageful of ivy leaves.
Glossy green paper made up a pre
liminary section of campus photos
that every student will pore ap
preciatively through—best of all
was the one of the Quad by night.
We overlook the book's rather un
inspired writing to applaud the pic
tures of Dr. Tresidder smiling from
the saddle of his horse, and Dean
Mary typically surrounded by a
group of young women. Other pic
tures we liked were the cut-outs
of class presidents, the choir pic
tures, and the gentleman on page
177.
No criticism of a yearbook could
adequately record the pleasure all
students must find in recalling one
chapter of their school days, but let
it be said that last year's Quad has
adequately — if not exceptionally
well—recorded the spirit of '45.

Mary typically surrounded by a
group of young women. Other pic
tures we liked were the cut-outs
of class presidents, the choir pic
tures, and the gentleman on page

No criticism of a yearbook could
adequately record the pleasure all
students must find in recalling one
chapter of their school days, but let
it be said that last year's Quad has
adequately — if not exceptionally
well—recorded the spirit of '45.

Wine and green and read all over
campus was the 1945 Stanford Quad

which yesterday made its tardy ap- ■
pearance and moved a reluctant j
student body to admit that the year
book was well worth the waiting.
Despite faulty photography in parts
and inconsistency in details, the
excellent research of the picture
staff, the fortunate choice of campus
"prominents," and the inspiration
of some of its artists placed the
Quad far above the average in war- j
i.imc yearbooks.
The Quad was formally dedicated
to retiring registrar John P. Mitchell,
but few students who read it
through did not have the feeling
that this volume belonged to Dick
Driscoll, former student body presi
dent who died October 2 as the re
sult of an auto accident. The ex
cellent color display and student
in-action poses on the division pages
rated secondary notice as readers
recognizcd "Drisc" tying his tie and
painting the puppet of the Old Boy.
Last year's staff photographer was
apparently omnipresent, for he
turned up in the high voltage lab
oratory. outside the chapel on V-E |
day, and with winter quarter's ,
skiers at Yosemite. We understood |
why not, but we certainly wish
there had been more of the same.
Pat Pierce's cartoons —especially |

the sludy in Stanford legs—and the
borders done by Ed McLellan were
tops artistically. The dignified, full
page pictures of the Quad Queens
gave appropriate display to some of
Stanford's most beautiful.
The cover papers of Stanford
seals carried forward the cover de
sign, and lead right into a some
what pointless pageful of ivy leaves.
Glossy green paper made up a pre
liminary section of campus photos
that every student will pore ap
preciatively through—best of all
was the one of the Quad by night.
We overlook the book's rather un
inspired writing to applaud the pic
tures of Dr. Tresidder smiling from
the saddle of his horse, and Dean
Mary typically surrounded by a
group of young women. Other pic
tures we liked were the cut-outs
of class presidents, the choir pic
tures, and the gentleman on page
