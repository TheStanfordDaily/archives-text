With wire scarce and wartime calls increasing,
telephone engineers made existing pairs of long
distance >vires carry nearly four times as many
calls as before. 1 his was done through installa-
C 7
tion of additional carrier equipment, requiring
closer spacing of the wires on the line and trans
positions at shorter intervals.
Three pairs on the Southern Transcontinental
Route were rearranged, and in a -130-mile section
this had to be done while keeping the urgently
needed wires in service all the time. To do this,
new tools and new methods had to be devised
in the laboratories and on the job.
This is another among many examples of how
Bell System teamwork and engineering skills
maintained telephone service under wartime
conditions.
