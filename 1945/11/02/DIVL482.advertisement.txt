It's checked, it's quilted
and a cure for your blues!
25.00
If your midquarters have left you un
happy, this housecoat-robe is guaranteed
to drive those blues away with its rayon
taffeta swish. The little self ruffles
around the yoke, neck, cuff, and pockets
make it perfect for Sunday brunch, and
afterwards when you re being lady-of
leisurish reading "Terry.' Besides raising
your morale when you study, the long
sleeves and quilting will keep you cozy. In
red and white, or black and white check.
