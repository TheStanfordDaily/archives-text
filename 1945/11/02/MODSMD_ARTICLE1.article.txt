# Army-Navy Sixes Meet Tomorrow
## Pigskin Potentials Try Might Before Diamond Rooters 
### 
It's Army vs. Navy at 2:15 tomor
row afternoon as representative
teams from the Farm's two service
units tangle in a six-man, touch foot
ball game. The scene of action for
this natural rivalry is slightly un
football since the tussle is to take
place on the sunken diamond. The
baseball field was selected in order
to accommodate all spectators.

Students are urged to attend to
morrow's football contest between
the Army-Navy and form an or
ganized rooting section in prep
aration for the game next Sat
urday, announced Pattie Whitte
morc, co-chairman of Rally Com.
Rally Coin will usher and Newt
Arnold, yell leader, and liis two
assistants will lead the rooters in
Stanford yells. Student interest
and enthusiasm in this game will
serve as a preview as to what can
be expected from Stanford spirit
on Nov. 17.

When the engagement was first
scheduled, the picture looked pretty
rosy for the army boys. Their team
has been rolling through all intra
mural opposition with no difficulties.
On the other hand the Navy had four
teams in a league of their own
none of which was setting the grass
afire.
Situation Changed
Since then, however, the situation
lias changed considerably, especially
for the self-coached soldier sextet.
Last Tuesday, Theis, their captain
and passing star, came out of a mural
tilt with a badly sprained knee. The
following day found the other half
of a Theis-Davis aerial combination
becoming another casualty due to an
army injury.
For the sailors things brightened
up a bit. Lt. Hal Williams, Naval
R.O.T.C. athletic officer, organized
three very capable teams. Some
personnel was drawn from the varsi
ty squad, including Knight, the
varsity's best passer.
Navy Line-Up
The way the teams line up now,
the bluejackets will probably start
Hcndershoot and Varncr at ends,
Williams at center, with Boles, Lar
son and Martin making up the back
field. The latter will be the navy's
captain.
With their one-two punch side
lined, the khaki wearers' first-string
is in a process of development. Po
sitions will be handled by Carrillo,
Man us, McGuinness, Braun, Bunch
and Bonifay.
The fray will be played on a regu
lation sized six-man field, that is,
sixty feet long and forty feet wide.
Officials will be Bob Kennedy,
(A.S.S.U. prexy), Jim Welter, army
cadet athletic officer, and one man
from the navy. Coach Bugge will
handle the timekeepers' duties.
In the near future the army will
probably send an all-star cage team
against Coach Dean's varsity out
lit. The A.S.T.'s have been playing
intramural basketball all fall and
have uncovered numerous players of
fair ability.
