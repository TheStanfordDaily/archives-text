B ATA VIA. Java, Nov. 1 (UP).â€”British forces paced by three lIAF
Thunderbolt lighter-bombers wrested control of most of Magelang in
central Java from Indonesian nationalists today. Allied warships e\ac
uated 5,000 Allied civilians from Socrabaja and the British hurried addi
tional air reinforcements to this uneasy island.
Reports of continued warfare between British occupation forces and
Dutch on the one hand and Indonesian indcpcndcnce-secking national
ists on the other continued to pour into Batavia despite the beginning of
informal talks here last night between Hubcrtus Van Mook, acting Dutch
governor of Java, and President Sockarno of the recently proclaimed
Indonesian republic.
