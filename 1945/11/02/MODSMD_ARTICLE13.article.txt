BRITISH OCCUPATION HEADQUARTERS, Germany, Nov. 1 (UP).
â€”Adolf Hitler and his bride of one day, Eva Braun, killed themselves in
the Berlin Reichschancellery shortly after 2:110 p.m. last April 110 and
their bodies were burned immediately, a British official report said today
on the basis of an exhaustive investigation.
Hitler shot himself, presumably through the mouth, and Eva Braun
took poison, the report said.
