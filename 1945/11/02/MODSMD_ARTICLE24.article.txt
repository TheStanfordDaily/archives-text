Lots of Room
Social chairman Newt Arnold
claims that Tyler has more space
for "dancin' and romancin'" than
any other hall on campus. "Be
sides," said Arnold, "our men have
been gathering lots of wood all
week for the fires."
"You'll find Tyler easily," ex
plained Treasurer Bob Slobe. "Come
to the end of the row and follow
the tremendous sign atop our roof,
and the green porch light."
Sponsors for the affair announced
so far are Mr. and Mrs. F. Cowles

Palm Trees Planned
Bob Blum, decorations department,
agreed that flowing palm branches
and dreamy lighting will really give
that South Seas atmosphere.
The "Gardenia Lei" men suggest
you wear anything from grass skirts
to blue jeans and plaid shirts.
