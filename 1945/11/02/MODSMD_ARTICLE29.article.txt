## KHAK! TO CORDS 
### 
The government has announced that the Eighth War Loan,
the drive which today begins on the Stanford campus, is the
drive of its kind. So, apparently, it's nearly over—all the
giving, and the rallies, and the auctions that have characterized
Stanford's contributions to the war effort.
In the next week, students will be able to give once more,
then watch with satisfaction as the books for World War II are
closed. Just one more time war loan committee-men, like their
forebears five years ago, will plead student support for a drive
that has been initiated to finance democracy throughout the
world.
The practice of giving is a lot more simple and a great deal
plea r:anter than the necessity which prompts it. In the past,
students were inspired to back the drives by the novelty of
"national defense" slogans, or the intensity of their desire to
beat Cal, or by an honest yearning to end the most horrible war
in history. This week, "Khaki to Cords" is the theme; dance
music, auctioneering, Army, Navy, and professor salesmen will
add spark to the serious plea for students to buy victory bonds
and stamps.
Stanford's drives have always been successful, whether be-
Ci use of attractive methods of giving, or a realization of the
need lor giving. However, a large proportion of the student
body no longer feels personal involvement in the war just ended
— so many friends are home, so many discharged, and there is
not the immediate danger of death to the men still overseas.
But the obligation is still there, to the men who don't want
to be forgotten and the cause they fought for. We financed these
men right out of their homes, most of them men we had never
even known. We paid for their uniforms (remember the novelty
of the uniforms, back in '41?), we gave them a gun and boots to
march in. A bond every guarter and stamps every week were
all that was asked. We dug deep the next time and paid their
way to North Africa. It kept on costing us through the fourth,
fifth, and six war loans—costing us plenty for Italy and Nor
mandy and the bombs on Merseberg. We paid their way across
to Tokyo, and this time, the last time, the U.S. government is
asking us to give again to put these same men b'ack in their
homes, back in college in the U.S.A.
There are lot of things for which we cannot pay. There is
work to be done on the Second World War that won't ever be
finished—all of us realize that. So although the end of the war
loan drives is only nominally an end to giving, it is the last
time lor the Indians to prove that they want to finish the job
they started.—B. M. V.

closed. Just one more time war loan committee-men, like their
forebears five years ago, will plead student support for a drive
that has been initiated to finance democracy throughout the
world.
The practice of giving is a lot more simple and a great deal
plea r:anter than the necessity which prompts it. In the past,
students were inspired to back the drives by the novelty of
"national defense" slogans, or the intensity of their desire to
beat Cal, or by an honest yearning to end the most horrible war
in history. This week, "Khaki to Cords" is the theme; dance
music, auctioneering, Army, Navy, and professor salesmen will
add spark to the serious plea for students to buy victory bonds
and stamps.
Stanford's drives have always been successful, whether be-
Ci use of attractive methods of giving, or a realization of the
need lor giving. However, a large proportion of the student
body no longer feels personal involvement in the war just ended
— so many friends are home, so many discharged, and there is
not the immediate danger of death to the men still overseas.
But the obligation is still there, to the men who don't want
to be forgotten and the cause they fought for. We financed these
men right out of their homes, most of them men we had never
even known. We paid for their uniforms (remember the novelty
of the uniforms, back in '41?), we gave them a gun and boots to
march in. A bond every guarter and stamps every week were
all that was asked. We dug deep the next time and paid their
way to North Africa. It kept on costing us through the fourth,
fifth, and six war loans—costing us plenty for Italy and Nor
mandy and the bombs on Merseberg. We paid their way across
to Tokyo, and this time, the last time, the U.S. government is
asking us to give again to put these same men b'ack in their
homes, back in college in the U.S.A.
There are lot of things for which we cannot pay. There is
work to be done on the Second World War that won't ever be
finished—all of us realize that. So although the end of the war
loan drives is only nominally an end to giving, it is the last
time lor the Indians to prove that they want to finish the job
they started.—B. M. V.
The government has announced that the Eighth War Loan,
the drive which today begins on the Stanford campus, is the
drive of its kind. So, apparently, it's nearly over—all the
giving, and the rallies, and the auctions that have characterized
Stanford's contributions to the war effort.
In the next week, students will be able to give once more,
then watch with satisfaction as the books for World War II are
closed. Just one more time war loan committee-men, like their
forebears five years ago, will plead student support for a drive
that has been initiated to finance democracy throughout the
world.
