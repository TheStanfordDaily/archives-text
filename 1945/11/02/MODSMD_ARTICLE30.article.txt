The spirit of democracy around here has become rather
feeble lately.
For instance, the civ libe incident Wednesday night when
the Jibe was closed an hour early, because of discrimination
against a poor creature who came in, all eager to study.
Her face was rather pasty, true, and her coloring was a
bit toned, but has Stanford forgotten that brains just don't use
any judgment when it comes to picking faces to go with them?
We can see where the pasty faced one's dog-faced friend
might have been objectionable, that is, from the safety point
of view. The dog-faced woman was on a leash, though, and
if she did prove vicious she could have been locked in the
with the independent students.
The whole thing was rather obvious too, the way the libe
was closed immediately after the two women wandered in.
Of course, all the time a rose-scented bomb was smouldering
in a corner.
Another matter of democracy on the down-grade are the neat
little lines they've been regimenting the Cellah Dwellahs into
lately. It just doesn't make for democratic living when people
v.'ith classes in the BAC have to race for places in line with
others who are just permanently stationed at the P.O.
Far cry from the old days, when Cellah time was the sur
vival of the bestest and strongest. That's what democracy is,
anyway—the harder you push, the quicker you'll get your
rolls and coffee.

Here's a chance for fame the easy way, minus biology and
English A. Recently a letter addressed to Eillie Macvicker
was missent to a Stanford queen of approximately the same
name.
The letter was from the Damascus Milk Co., of Portland,
and nominated this Billie Macvicker person as Miss Milk Bottle
of 1945. Well, the Stanford person of approximately that name
said she wouldn't think of stealing this other person's glory,
and that she just wasn't the milk bottle type, and all that.
Point is, anyone with a flair for forgery and, well, is just
the type —you're in.
