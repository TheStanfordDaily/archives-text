# Owners Asked To Call For Quads, 1-4 Today
## 
### 
"Although the 1945 Quads are
still being distributed, owners are
not calling for them rapidly
enough," Business Manager Ann
Lilienthal said today. Only about
250 of the 17(10 yearbooks have
been called for, she said. Quads
will be distributed again today
from 1 to 4 p.m. in the Quad office.
