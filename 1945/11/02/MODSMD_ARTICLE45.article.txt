When two undefeated teams meet
in a basketball game one of them
will come away as a loser for the
first time. Wednesday night such
fate befell the high scoring combine
that plays de nomen "Shushies."
Their conquerors and only remain
ing unbeaten five was the smooth
operating Vita-Men.
31 Point Total
With Altman, Miyashita, and Ross
dumping in nine, eight, and eight
points, respectively, while receiving
substantial assistance from Birn
baum and Samson, the winners rol
led up a 31 point total. Particularly
effective in the defensive depart
ment. they held Polan, the Shushie
scoring threat, in check enough to
allow him only five markers. Polan
in one game this season swished the
nets to a forty-odd point tune.
Only two other regularly sched
uled contests were played off and
they differed considerably in close
ness and quality. The not so impo
tent Bums easily took the B.F.'s 30-
15 with Hedrick taking scoring hon
ors. The third fray put the A.T.&Q.
Club against the mis-named .Giant
Five. The final score read 50-17
with the little giants on the deficient
end of the count.
Eliminations
Next week the teams swing into
an elimination tournament with all
outfits participating. The ultimate
winner will receive the battalion
championship prize. Enlistments in
to the Regular Army and separa
tions due to other causes have
played havoc with many teams. Of
the original 20, about 15 are ex
pected to take the floor for the play
offs.
Plans are underway with Coach
Dean for an Army All-Star quintet
to engage the varsity in a contest
some time late in November.
