### ART LEVINSON 
Recent criticism has been heaped
at the sports staff and this writer
in particular for not talking more
about sports-activities on the Farm,
instead of getting carried away into
distant realms of surf board riding
at San Onofre, bangtail chatter at
Bay Meadows, wrestling at the San
Diego Coliseum, and boxing in Wat
sonville Junction. The dissenters
can't see any connection of these
professional activities with the sport
scene at Stanford. Neither can we,
but rather than turn the whole paper
over to the editorial staff, we have
tried to bring a resemblance of a
sports page to readers of the only
morning newspaper on the Peninsula.
Campus sports material has been
scant for the obvious reason that
Stanford has been dormant for the
past three years in inter-collegiate
sports. When there aren't any ac
tivities comin' off, there isn't much
to write about. Intra-murals have
been the only resemblance to any
organized sports activities on the
farm, and judging from recent de
faults of entered teams, enthusiasm
has been sadly lacking in the foot
ball race this fall. Now that I've
splashed crocodile tears all over the
Underwood in defense of the sports
staff, let's see what's brewin' on the
sports panorama ....
GAELS INVADE COLISEUM
Top football fray of the Pacific
Coast is—natch—the meeting of St.
Mary's and the Trojans of Southern
California. SC, which was an early
favorite to cop the contest, has been
steadily losing support to the point
where Main Street bet takers are
offering no more than even money,
with the Galloping Gaels of Moraga
demanding more respect as game
time approaches.
Herm Wedemeyer, the pigskin im
port from Hawaii—and who has
been called the greatest football
player of all time by Bill Leiser,
sports editor of the Chronicle and
former editor of the Daily during
undergrad days at Stanford — will
lead the Jimmy Phelan coached
team into the L. A. Coliseum be
fore a crowd of at least 95.000. On
him depends victory or defeat for
ths bay region school. Not that
Cordeiro, Van Giesen, O'Connor,
Ryan, and the rest of the boys aren't

good, but man-for-man they don't
rate in experience or weight with
the opposing eleven. Wedemeyer's
running, Wedemeyer's passing, We
demeyer's kicking, Wedemeyer's
blocking, and Wedemeyer's play call
ing must spell the difference between
the two teams. Can he do it? We
are of the opinion he can.
Nevertheless, USC must not be
discounted just because they were
dumped by U of W up in the lum
berjack territory last Saturday. Cra
vath, the mentor at the Los Angeles
institution, has been experimenting
with a new backfield combination,
shifting his quarterbacks to half
back spots. Although this experi
ment might have long-range bene
fits, we don't think the men will be
sufficiently acquainted with their
new posts to down the light and
experienced squad of St. Mary's that
is still die best collegiate team on
the Pacific Coast this season ....
POSSIBLE UPSET BY OREGON
Up in the swampy territory of
Portland, Oregon plays host to the
visiting Huskies from Seattle. Wash
ington is favored, but don't spill
your Sunday morning cup of coffee
in amazement if you see in the
paper that Oregon has won. If Jake
Leicht, the fleet-footed back of Eu
gene, gets going, anything can hap
pen, the most probable being Ore
gon touchdowns. But on the other
hand, if Stacy and Hein combine
for Washington like they did against
El Trojan, sure defeat is in the
offing for Tex Oliver's gang ....
Praises from Stanford in particu
lar should be thrown northward to
Washington for downing USC last
Saturday. If SC had grabbed the
affair, their road to the Rose Bowl
would have been unhampered, but
now the Huskies are the leading
team for the Coast representative in
the Pasadena shindig on New Year's
Day, which will prevent Southern
Cal from participating in the affair
for three years straight.
The record for consecutive visits
to the Bowl is held by Stanford,
and that record is three years. (The
Vow Boys did it in '33, '34, and '35.)
Our collegiate compatriots to the
south would have tied that record
this year, a good cause for deep
sadness here, but the glittering hopes
of the angel city university were
dashed to bits six days ago ....

distant realms of surf board riding
at San Onofre, bangtail chatter at
Bay Meadows, wrestling at the San
Diego Coliseum, and boxing in Wat
sonville Junction. The dissenters
can't see any connection of these
professional activities with the sport
scene at Stanford. Neither can we,
but rather than turn the whole paper
over to the editorial staff, we have
tried to bring a resemblance of a
sports page to readers of the only
morning newspaper on the Peninsula.
Campus sports material has been
scant for the obvious reason that
Stanford has been dormant for the
past three years in inter-collegiate
sports. When there aren't any ac
tivities comin' off, there isn't much
to write about. Intra-murals have
been the only resemblance to any
organized sports activities on the
farm, and judging from recent de
faults of entered teams, enthusiasm
has been sadly lacking in the foot
ball race this fall. Now that I've
splashed crocodile tears all over the
Underwood in defense of the sports
staff, let's see what's brewin' on the
sports panorama ....
GAELS INVADE COLISEUM
Top football fray of the Pacific
Coast is—natch—the meeting of St.
Mary's and the Trojans of Southern
California. SC, which was an early
favorite to cop the contest, has been
steadily losing support to the point
where Main Street bet takers are
offering no more than even money,
with the Galloping Gaels of Moraga
demanding more respect as game
time approaches.
Herm Wedemeyer, the pigskin im
port from Hawaii—and who has
been called the greatest football
player of all time by Bill Leiser,
sports editor of the Chronicle and
former editor of the Daily during
undergrad days at Stanford — will
lead the Jimmy Phelan coached
team into the L. A. Coliseum be
fore a crowd of at least 95.000. On
him depends victory or defeat for
ths bay region school. Not that
Cordeiro, Van Giesen, O'Connor,
Ryan, and the rest of the boys aren't

good, but man-for-man they don't
rate in experience or weight with
the opposing eleven. Wedemeyer's
running, Wedemeyer's passing, We
demeyer's kicking, Wedemeyer's
blocking, and Wedemeyer's play call
ing must spell the difference between
the two teams. Can he do it? We
are of the opinion he can.
Nevertheless, USC must not be
discounted just because they were
dumped by U of W up in the lum
berjack territory last Saturday. Cra
vath, the mentor at the Los Angeles
institution, has been experimenting
with a new backfield combination,
shifting his quarterbacks to half
back spots. Although this experi
ment might have long-range bene
fits, we don't think the men will be
sufficiently acquainted with their
new posts to down the light and
experienced squad of St. Mary's that
is still die best collegiate team on
the Pacific Coast this season ....
POSSIBLE UPSET BY OREGON
Up in the swampy territory of
Portland, Oregon plays host to the
visiting Huskies from Seattle. Wash
ington is favored, but don't spill
your Sunday morning cup of coffee
in amazement if you see in the
paper that Oregon has won. If Jake
Leicht, the fleet-footed back of Eu
gene, gets going, anything can hap
pen, the most probable being Ore
gon touchdowns. But on the other
hand, if Stacy and Hein combine
for Washington like they did against
El Trojan, sure defeat is in the
offing for Tex Oliver's gang ....
Praises from Stanford in particu
lar should be thrown northward to
Washington for downing USC last
Saturday. If SC had grabbed the
affair, their road to the Rose Bowl
would have been unhampered, but
now the Huskies are the leading
team for the Coast representative in
the Pasadena shindig on New Year's
Day, which will prevent Southern
Cal from participating in the affair
for three years straight.
The record for consecutive visits
to the Bowl is held by Stanford,
and that record is three years. (The
Vow Boys did it in '33, '34, and '35.)
Our collegiate compatriots to the
south would have tied that record
this year, a good cause for deep
sadness here, but the glittering hopes
of the angel city university were
dashed to bits six days ago ....
Recent criticism has been heaped
at the sports staff and this writer
in particular for not talking more
about sports-activities on the Farm,
instead of getting carried away into
distant realms of surf board riding
at San Onofre, bangtail chatter at
Bay Meadows, wrestling at the San

sonville Junction. The dissenters
can't see any connection of these
professional activities with the sport
scene at Stanford. Neither can we,
but rather than turn the whole paper
over to the editorial staff, we have
tried to bring a resemblance of a
sports page to readers of the only
morning newspaper on the Peninsula.
Campus sports material has been
scant for the obvious reason that
Stanford has been dormant for the
past three years in inter-collegiate
sports. When there aren't any ac
tivities comin' off, there isn't much
to write about. Intra-murals have
been the only resemblance to any
organized sports activities on the
farm, and judging from recent de
faults of entered teams, enthusiasm
has been sadly lacking in the foot
ball race this fall. Now that I've
splashed crocodile tears all over the
Underwood in defense of the sports
staff, let's see what's brewin' on the
sports panorama ....
GAELS INVADE COLISEUM
Top football fray of the Pacific
Coast is—natch—the meeting of St.
Mary's and the Trojans of Southern
California. SC, which was an early
favorite to cop the contest, has been
steadily losing support to the point
where Main Street bet takers are
offering no more than even money,
with the Galloping Gaels of Moraga
demanding more respect as game
time approaches.
Herm Wedemeyer, the pigskin im
port from Hawaii—and who has
been called the greatest football
player of all time by Bill Leiser,
sports editor of the Chronicle and
former editor of the Daily during
undergrad days at Stanford — will
lead the Jimmy Phelan coached
team into the L. A. Coliseum be
fore a crowd of at least 95.000. On
him depends victory or defeat for
ths bay region school. Not that
Cordeiro, Van Giesen, O'Connor,
Ryan, and the rest of the boys aren't

good, but man-for-man they don't
rate in experience or weight with
the opposing eleven. Wedemeyer's
running, Wedemeyer's passing, We
demeyer's kicking, Wedemeyer's
blocking, and Wedemeyer's play call
ing must spell the difference between
the two teams. Can he do it? We
are of the opinion he can.
Nevertheless, USC must not be
discounted just because they were
dumped by U of W up in the lum
berjack territory last Saturday. Cra
vath, the mentor at the Los Angeles
institution, has been experimenting
with a new backfield combination,
shifting his quarterbacks to half
back spots. Although this experi
ment might have long-range bene
fits, we don't think the men will be
sufficiently acquainted with their
new posts to down the light and
experienced squad of St. Mary's that
is still die best collegiate team on
the Pacific Coast this season ....
POSSIBLE UPSET BY OREGON
Up in the swampy territory of
Portland, Oregon plays host to the
visiting Huskies from Seattle. Wash
ington is favored, but don't spill
your Sunday morning cup of coffee
in amazement if you see in the
paper that Oregon has won. If Jake
Leicht, the fleet-footed back of Eu
gene, gets going, anything can hap
pen, the most probable being Ore
gon touchdowns. But on the other
hand, if Stacy and Hein combine
for Washington like they did against
El Trojan, sure defeat is in the
offing for Tex Oliver's gang ....
Praises from Stanford in particu
lar should be thrown northward to
Washington for downing USC last
Saturday. If SC had grabbed the
affair, their road to the Rose Bowl
would have been unhampered, but
now the Huskies are the leading
team for the Coast representative in
the Pasadena shindig on New Year's
Day, which will prevent Southern
Cal from participating in the affair
for three years straight.
The record for consecutive visits
to the Bowl is held by Stanford,
and that record is three years. (The
Vow Boys did it in '33, '34, and '35.)
Our collegiate compatriots to the
south would have tied that record
this year, a good cause for deep
sadness here, but the glittering hopes
of the angel city university were
dashed to bits six days ago ....
