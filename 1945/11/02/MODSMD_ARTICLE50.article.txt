CHINESE WAR
The Chinese war is continuing, although it still is not de
clared. The Chinese army in Peiping and the one ferried up
to a nearby port have taken post on the Manchurian border.
Communist pickets made no attempt to resist their progress,
but fell back steadily, keeping in contact with the Nationalist
advance guard.
In the south, Nationalist troops moving up from the center
of the country are trying to control the north banks of the
Yangtze, and the Communists admit that their forces are being
driven in.
No definite news comes from other sectors of the front,
save for one. a
RAIDING FORCE
The Communist unit operating on the Peiping-Hankow rail
road is thus confirmed as a raiding force. If it wasn't, the troops
in Peiping would be still moving forward.
However the news from the other sector of the front shows
that the Communists want to plant more in this area. The
Nationalists charge That they have moved a considerble con
centration against the Central Government troops in the center
of the line.
If this is the truth, the Communists are reasoning that the
advances on both wings are not an immediate threat to them,
and are holding down large Nationalists forces. Thus they might
be trying to split Chaing's army in half, and, in concentration
v/ith Communists in Manchuria, simultaneously envelop and
force the front of the two armies advancing north from the
Peiping area. If they succeed in breaking through, the pres
ent battle will be a question of reserves.
