# Barricades of Bicycles, Flower Beds Baffle Would'Be Branner Visitors
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
The geranium maze in front of
! Branner has been the downfall of
many a first visitor. "All I wanta
know is how to get in," she laments,
as she stands at the dead-end of a
flower path, surrounded by doors.
To avoid all confusion, one should
never approach Branner from the
direction of Quad or San Jose. The
first entrances from those directions
are the exclusive property of bi
cycles, and beyond the entangle
ments of spokes and handlebars are
signs reading, "This Door Not In
Use." Rather, make your approach
from across the front hay field, keep
going straight, avoiding the geran
ium maze, and you will reach two
doors, both of which open and lead
to the interior.
i Pool Tables in Lobby
You're in. Now approach the rc
j ception desk for information, or just
| sit quietly in the lobby and imagine
j how the room must have looked with
j a pool table in the center, before
the advent of women and the card
inal-colored drapes.
If your passport is in order, you'll
be guided upstairs—guided because
there are four different approaches
to the second floor. You begin to
question the mythical sandpaper
| surface of the old-time roughs as
you pause in one of the second floor
■ suites, with its high ceilings and
light blue or green woodwork and
pale pink walls. Then there are
the third floor rooms, with their
I private balconies.
Meal-Time
Meal-time at Branner is much the

same as meal-time at any other
women's dorm. Getting to the meals
is the unusual feature. The dining
room is connected to Branner by
two wings, closed on one side with
glass bricks, and opening on the
other side onto a patio with benches
and palm trees. This is unofficial,
of course, but the Branner hashers,
have set some sort of record for
birthday parties. Then they have
their own Halloween party, at which

| (hey decapitate a member of the
j staff.
If you wait until after 10 to start
! your trip back to the campus, you
j can visit the Branner Cavity, the
| hole into which all good bookworms
crawl from 10 to 10:30. The pride
;of Branner is the Cavity's big,
| glass freezing case, packed with
cokes and fruit juice. Branner reve
j lation of the week: The Cavity re
| ceived a shipment of chcese.
