# Joseph Szigeti Recital Extremely Modernistic: Audience Responds 'Enthusiastically' To Contemporary Program
## 
### 
In a recital featuring extremely
modernistic selections, violinist
Joseph Szigeti opened the 1945-46
Concert Series in Memorial Hall
last night. Although the program
favored contemporary composers, the

I audience responded enthusiastically
to his virtuosity.
"Classic" Qualities
The first selection was the con
trolled "Sonata in D Major, No. 1"
of Beethoven. This was the only
work on the program that contained
"classic" qualities, and was rend
ered in a commendably steady fash
ion.
ProkofiefT's "Sonata in D Major"
showed a good deal of technique
and difficult rhythms. The Debus-

I sy "Sonata in G" was typically im
j pressionistic and performed in a
cool, ethereal manner. The weird
harmonies so typical of the composer
lent much to be unusual quality of
the program.
I Technical Tricks
The "Largo" of Veracini was
! melodic yet restrained, while the
I "Caprice No. 24" by Paganini, played
| as a solo by Mr. Szigeti, displayed
i every technical trick in the book.
The last half of the program was
| devoted to short, showy works of
| the more contemporary composers.
| The "Jeux d'eau" of Ravel enabled
Mr. Szigeti to use double stops to
j a very cfTcctivc end; while "Snow,"
| a Norwegian song by Lie, accentu
j ated this artist's facility with double
! Harmonics.
A short, flighty "Dance Fantasti
que" by Shostakovich left the au
dience holding their breath, and the
[ stirring "Russian Dance" from
' "Petrushka" by Stravinsky helped
; the program in grand style. Pizzi
•' catos, double stops, and an excel -
| lent display of cooperation between
I piano and violin made this work a
! grand finale.
Full of Assurance
Mr. Szigeti's playing was full or
i assurance and his mastering of the
i many difficult technical passages
j throughout the major portion of the
works made for a very fine per
formance. The sole lack on the prq
| gram was balanced by four encores,
| including Dvorak's "Slavonic Dance
i No. 5," the "Polka" from the "Gold
| en Age" Ballet by Shostakovich:
| "Young Girls in a Garden," by
; Monpou; and "Zepher" by Jeno
Hubay.
Though the program was inter
rupted with the breaking of a string
during Mr. Szigeti's last selection,
the finesse and graciousness of his
personality endeared himself to the
large audience.
Mr. Loenid Hambro, having just
completed his own concert tour,
showed fine steadiness in the ac
companiment of the Beethoven
"Sonata," as well as fine control in
the Stravinsky work.
If last night's concert is a sample
of what is in store this season, it
I might be worth while to buy a
I season ticket.—Gumbrecht.

| The "Jeux d'eau" of Ravel enabled
Mr. Szigeti to use double stops to
j a very cfTcctivc end; while "Snow,"

j ated this artist's facility with double
! Harmonics.
A short, flighty "Dance Fantasti
que" by Shostakovich left the au
dience holding their breath, and the
[ stirring "Russian Dance" from
' "Petrushka" by Stravinsky helped
; the program in grand style. Pizzi
•' catos, double stops, and an excel -
| lent display of cooperation between
I piano and violin made this work a
! grand finale.
Full of Assurance
Mr. Szigeti's playing was full or
i assurance and his mastering of the
i many difficult technical passages
j throughout the major portion of the
works made for a very fine per
formance. The sole lack on the prq
| gram was balanced by four encores,
| including Dvorak's "Slavonic Dance
i No. 5," the "Polka" from the "Gold
| en Age" Ballet by Shostakovich:
| "Young Girls in a Garden," by
; Monpou; and "Zepher" by Jeno
Hubay.
Though the program was inter
rupted with the breaking of a string
during Mr. Szigeti's last selection,
the finesse and graciousness of his
personality endeared himself to the
large audience.
Mr. Loenid Hambro, having just
completed his own concert tour,
showed fine steadiness in the ac
companiment of the Beethoven
"Sonata," as well as fine control in
the Stravinsky work.

In a recital featuring extremely
modernistic selections, violinist
Joseph Szigeti opened the 1945-46
Concert Series in Memorial Hall
last night. Although the program
favored contemporary composers, the

I audience responded enthusiastically
to his virtuosity.
"Classic" Qualities
The first selection was the con
trolled "Sonata in D Major, No. 1"
of Beethoven. This was the only
work on the program that contained
"classic" qualities, and was rend
ered in a commendably steady fash
ion.
ProkofiefT's "Sonata in D Major"
showed a good deal of technique
and difficult rhythms. The Debus-

I sy "Sonata in G" was typically im
j pressionistic and performed in a
cool, ethereal manner. The weird
harmonies so typical of the composer
lent much to be unusual quality of
the program.
I Technical Tricks
The "Largo" of Veracini was
! melodic yet restrained, while the
I "Caprice No. 24" by Paganini, played
| as a solo by Mr. Szigeti, displayed
i every technical trick in the book.
The last half of the program was
| devoted to short, showy works of
| the more contemporary composers.
