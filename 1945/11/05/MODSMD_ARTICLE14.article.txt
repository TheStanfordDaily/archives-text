## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UP).—
The nation was handed a sober
warning tonight by Bernard M. Bar
uch, elder statesman and adviser of
Presidents. It was an admonition
that "the race of selfishness is on,
that industrial strife must cease,
and that American money must not
be used to nationalize foreign in
dustry against us."
His views on current foreign and
domestic poblems were set forth in
a letter dated Oct. 25 to Rep. Albert
Fore, D„ Tenn., who made it public.
It carried this postscript:
"The miracle of American pro
duction can save the situation now,
as it did in the war, but it must
hurry, hurry, hurry!" And if trouble
continues on the labor-industrial
front, he said, the government may
feel required to intervene to protect
both the public and the contestants.
Baruch wrote the letter after
meeting with a group of troubled
congressmen in his own apartment.
His friend, Gore, headed the dele
gation.
The letter began by saying that
economic problems could not be
settled without an over-all balance
sheet showing debts and commit
ments.
"Then we ought to examine our
productive capacity and determine
how to devide that production, first,
to see that enough of what is pro
duced remains in the United States
to avoid disastrous inflation, and
then how much to allocate for the
rehabilitation of Europe, China and
the Philippines," Baruch wrote.
