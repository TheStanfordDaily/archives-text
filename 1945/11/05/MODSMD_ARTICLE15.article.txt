### JACKIE WOOLF 
"How is it done? It is done by
living for it, not thinking of how
little will do it, but how much you
can get out of yourself," said Joseph
Szigeti after his concert Thursday
evening.
Stressing the importance of be
ing in touch with all that happens
and keeping abreast of the new
developments, Mr. Szigeti stated his
preference for the music of the
modern I imes. However, he added
that "a Beethoven sonata written
in 179!) fits into a program with a
ProkoliefT sonata just as Shakespeare
can be read and enjoyed in con
junction with the New Yorker. Be
cause people know and understand
them, their works are eternally
young,"
I*laiis Tour
Mr. Szigeti will make a tour of
the Northwest, after lie leaves San
Francisco, goin« as far as British
Columbia. Later in the season he
will give a concert at U.C.L.A. and
on December 16 he will be on the
Standard Hour. Also in December
he will record the ProkofiefT Sonata
in D Major, Opus 4!) which he played
here, and a group of Russian Mod
ern works.
His autobiography, which de
scribes many of the personalities he
knew as a child and also those he

knows now, will be published some
time in April or May by Alfred
Knopf. "I wrote it myself, in Eng
lish—the hard way!" he laughed.
Born in Budapest
Although he was born in Buda
pest, Hungary, Mr. Szigeti is about
to become an American citizen. He
entered the musical world in Europe

at the aye of 13, and was intro
duced in this country in 1925, when
he made his debut with Leopold
Stokowski and the Philadelphia
symphonies. Since then he has been
a soloist with most of the country's
leading symphonies.
During the war he has partici
pated in many camp shows for the
servicemen and given numerous
USO programs. Besides this he has
taken an active part in the de
velopment of television, playing be
fore cameras for the BBC in Lon
don in 1039 at one of the first tele
vision programs presented.
Many Interests
His musical interests are wide,
ranging from a deep understanding
of the classics to a broad apprecia
tion of modern swing. Benny Good
man has named the violinist his
"musical idol," and has played with
him several times.
When asked what he thought of
the Stanford audience. Mr. Szigeti
replied that they were "exception
al." "The crowd was extremely
alive, and seemed to follow me ev
ery minute." He added that the
group as a whole appeared to have
a wide understanding and appreci
ation of the selections chosen for the
evening's program.
After his concert at Stanford, Mr.
Szigeti left for San Francisco, where
he is staying at the Fairmont Hotel.
