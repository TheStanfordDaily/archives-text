SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 4 (UP).
—While a War Shipping Adminis
tration charged that the CIO-AFL
machinists' strike was delaying i-e
-turn of approximately 22,000 troops
from the Pacific went unanswered,
the dispute neared its second week.
Negotiations were broken of! three
days ago and both employers and
the unions reportedly were waiting
to hear from Director Edgar L. War
ren of the U.S. Conciliation Service.
The strikers seek a wage increase,
but approximately 40,000 other un
ionists, thrown out of work by the
strike, were quoted as "becoming
restless."
A. T. Wynn, secretary of the Bay
Cities Metal Trades Council, said a
meeting was planned to determine
whether the combined union groups
would continue to support the strike.
The council has not approved picket
lines thrown around shipyards and
claimed that the strike was not
sanctioned by the AFL International
Association of Machinists.
The WSA charged yesterday,
through Lt. Cmdr. W. C. Peet, Pa
cific Coast director, that 12 troop
ships, capable of transporting 22,290
troops, were being delayed in port
here because machinists were not
doing repair work.
The future of the deadlock faced
another snag, Jack Shelley, Labor
Council president, said, "because so
many other unions have been com
plaining about the position in which
they have been placed by the ma
chinists' strike."
Two hundred plants and shipyards
have been closed by the strike,
which, it is claimed, was called in
violation of the War Labor Disputes
Act.
