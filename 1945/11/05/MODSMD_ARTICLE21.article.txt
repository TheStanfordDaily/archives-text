# "STANFORD WILL MISS YOU, DR. LANZ"
## 
### 
A tall, familiar figure has disappeared from the Stanford
c :mpus; and faculty and almost three decades of students regret
the deaih of Dr. Henry Lanz. But those who studied Philosophy
and Russian cannot easily forget him. Their sentiment was well
expressed several years ago in this caption underneath his pic
ture in the Quad: "To us, 'Slavic Civilization' will always be
Henry Lanz."
Students liked and respected this man who was so academi
cally versatile, and yet so easy to approach. He was author
and full Professor of both Philosophy and Slavic Civilization as
well s Russian instructor. Yet he treated the stuttering begin
ner (i3 an adult and equal, encouraged him to keep on trying,
and . 'Jiled interest to routine drill with an occasional bit of Rus
sian humor.
"ii was always an unconventional man," Dr. Trueblood said
fit ill final services in Memorial Church. That very character
istic added much to his classes; students enjoyed his abrupt and
unexpected suggestions. One class will long remember the
week he waived all reading assignments, brought a deck of
cards, and taught them to bid and play the Russian version of
bride: llir pupils never learned the less because he locked the
classroom and took them all to the Music Listening Lounge or
G I "lure that he considered interesting.
He often dined at Roble or Lagunita where hostesses some
â– firm forgot their dinner while they listened to tales of Heidel
berg r.r Moscow. And after dessert they customarily led the
Wny to a piano and asked Dr. Lanz to play Beethoven or Tchai
kowsky.
In the long existence of a university it is inevitable that well
howii faces should disappear and be replaced. Each genera
linn of students must experience this loss. Yet surely it is per
ri'ifisible to say, "Stanford will miss you, Dr. Lanz."- L. E.
