This is just to show the econ department that you don't have
io spend two quarters of your life drawing their pictures in
Coder to understand today's financial problems.
First, take the milk shortage on the Peninsula. It all came
ro suddenly—everyone knew that milk was in season—that the
Damascus Milk Co. (they're still looking for Miss Milk Bottle)
squhmed diplomatically out of the situation by saying that the
cows were on sit-down strike. It just can't be, though. Cows
either stand up on all fours of fall flat on all fours. There's no
sit down to it.
Rather, it was all those people wearing shoes in San Francisco
last week. It's logical enough that you can't make a cow give
with a couple of gallons for Damascus every day, and then do
nate its hide to keep San Franciscans literally off the streets.
Of course, the whole situation didn't affect Stanford. No one
wanted to go back to that stuffy old tradition of shoes on Quad
ony way.
Something closer to the Stanford heart is the varying price
of Cellar lime rickies. Just try questioning Mr. Strauss about
it, and you'll get a quotation straight from the Chronicle grut
section—Bethlehem Steel, 97 5 8 plus 3 3/8, 10 cents MWF,
7 per cent preferred 152 plus 1, 15 cents TThS.
You can't kid us, though, Mr. S. We've checked, and every
]5 cent day follows a night when the burglar alarms on the trees
on Quad have been connected. Those are the days when you,
sub, have to tromp into the Paly markets and buy commercially
ec lored limus. The Quad grapefruit, green by courtesy of All-
Purpose Rit, don't make for such smooth Cellah drinking, but the
live cent cut —!
Now, a financial prediction, minus aid of the econ department.
As soon as Hage's Record Shop is able to get in enough of Hoagy
Carmichael's "Hong Kong Blues" to flood the campus, the price
of tickets on the Paly to San Francisco Steam Animal will be
doubled. Supply and demand, y' know.
The way Mr. C. twangs, "Take Me Back to Saaaan Fran-ciss
ro" well, somehow "Stanford in the Spring" is just a big sans
]n race to compete. " —And bury mah bahhh-d-dy there—"
Can't you see it now, the smart concessioner who'll first grab
th' 1 contract for plots in Union Square!

th' 1 contract for plots in Union Square!
This is just to show the econ department that you don't have
io spend two quarters of your life drawing their pictures in
Coder to understand today's financial problems.
First, take the milk shortage on the Peninsula. It all came
ro suddenly—everyone knew that milk was in season—that the
Damascus Milk Co. (they're still looking for Miss Milk Bottle)
squhmed diplomatically out of the situation by saying that the
cows were on sit-down strike. It just can't be, though. Cows
either stand up on all fours of fall flat on all fours. There's no
sit down to it.
Rather, it was all those people wearing shoes in San Francisco
last week. It's logical enough that you can't make a cow give
with a couple of gallons for Damascus every day, and then do
nate its hide to keep San Franciscans literally off the streets.
Of course, the whole situation didn't affect Stanford. No one
wanted to go back to that stuffy old tradition of shoes on Quad
ony way.
Something closer to the Stanford heart is the varying price
of Cellar lime rickies. Just try questioning Mr. Strauss about
it, and you'll get a quotation straight from the Chronicle grut
section—Bethlehem Steel, 97 5 8 plus 3 3/8, 10 cents MWF,
7 per cent preferred 152 plus 1, 15 cents TThS.
You can't kid us, though, Mr. S. We've checked, and every
]5 cent day follows a night when the burglar alarms on the trees
on Quad have been connected. Those are the days when you,
sub, have to tromp into the Paly markets and buy commercially
ec lored limus. The Quad grapefruit, green by courtesy of All-
Purpose Rit, don't make for such smooth Cellah drinking, but the
live cent cut —!
Now, a financial prediction, minus aid of the econ department.
As soon as Hage's Record Shop is able to get in enough of Hoagy
Carmichael's "Hong Kong Blues" to flood the campus, the price
of tickets on the Paly to San Francisco Steam Animal will be
doubled. Supply and demand, y' know.
The way Mr. C. twangs, "Take Me Back to Saaaan Fran-ciss
ro" well, somehow "Stanford in the Spring" is just a big sans
]n race to compete. " —And bury mah bahhh-d-dy there—"
Can't you see it now, the smart concessioner who'll first grab
th' 1 contract for plots in Union Square!
