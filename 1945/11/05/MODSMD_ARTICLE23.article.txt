LETTER TO THE SOPHOMORE CLASS
We've been hearing a lot of talk about the new and better
spirit that the sophomores want to build up in their class. Many
of the same sophomores who have complained about a lack of
Stanford spirit were conspicuously absent at the sophomore
meeting and Scavenger Hunt, Saturday night.
The class excom had listened to these complaints and had
r: tor ted plans to unify the sophs. It was guite a shock to the
f./.com when 75 out of 500 sophomores appeared at our first class
meeting. It was another shock to see that only 20 sophomore
Joys were interested enough to come. If this showing is an in
dication of our new and better spirit, soph excom is going to
have a hard time getting cooperation for future activities.
This attitude that some class members have of "letting George
rlo it" puts all the work on the shoulders of those who are in
terested enough to plan for and attend the functions. Seventy
five people with spirit and perseverence proved that they could
put over a class affair last Saturday night. But to create a really
Strong class, every sophomore has to be willing to do his part.
The excom has big plans for the fuhire which will reguire
the aid of every class member. We know that the sophomores
oro capable of carrying out these plans successfully.
Let's get rolling, sophs! The "75" of '48.
