CHUNGKING, Nov. 4 (UP).â€”
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek said

the world hinged upon speedy
achievement of independence for
Korea. He pledged China would
consult with Russia, the United
States and Britain regarding self

has maintained headquarters in
Chungking during eight years of
war.
All Korean groups must co-oper
ate fully with the American and
Soviet occupation troops, Chiang
said, pending the time when a de
cision can be reached regarding in
dependence. He pledged that the
"fixed policy" of the Chinese gov
ernment was to aid in that achieve
ment.
He called for Korea to unite un
der the leadership of Kim Koo, the
president of the provisional govern
ment.
Chiang was emphatic in his warn
ing that all East Asia was walching
the late of Koea.
Chiang cautioned the Korean
leaders that they must do their ut
most to "get along equally well with
the Americans and Russians for
achievement of your historical mis
sion of independence and freedom."
The Korean and central govern
ment leaders attended a tea at
which Madame Chiang acted as
hostess, sitting beside her husband
and chatting with Koo.
