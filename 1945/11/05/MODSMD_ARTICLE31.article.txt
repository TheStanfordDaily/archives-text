# ON THE DISCS
## 
### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Boasting a clever title, the re
cent Vaughn Monroe album, "On
the Moon-Beam," presents a group
of tunes each with the word "moon"
in tßeir titles. The melodies, all
popular during the last decade, are
very listenable especially if you aie
more interested in your girl than
in the music. In short, it is music
that sounds better if you are not
paying particular attention to it.
Monroe's vocal efforts are fea
tured on every platter in the ten
sided album, and his heavy opera
type voice somehow seems out of
place on these sentimental ballads.
The numbers consist of "Monlight
and Roses," "Moon of ManiUoora,"
"Paper Moon," "Moon Over Miami,"
"Moonglow," "Blue Moon," "Harv
est Moon," "Carolina Moon,"
"Moon Love," and "Racing with
the Moon," the Monroe theme
song.
The History of Jazz
In last Thursday's column, we be
gan the review of four albums which
have been issued by the Capitol Re
cording Company. The albums pre
sent a musical history of jazz, and
the second one entitled "The Gold
en Era" can be classified as just
good music rather than history.
With only one disc actually rep
resentative of the past, the albu-m
fails in this respect, but makes up
for the lack by bringing to the
public some very fresh and enjoy
able platters. The "historical" rec
ord is the one cut by Paul White
man and his orchestra. These sides,
"Wang Wang Blues," and "San," are
the actual arrangements that White
man vised in the early twenties, and
they only go to illustrate that ar
ranged Divieland always leads to
bad Dixieland. Gathered together
to represent early Chicago jazz, the
group that is featured on the sec
ond disc is one of tremendous
ability. With Jack Teagarden head

| ing the combo with his "tram," .some
i of the leading musicians are Dave
112 Barbour, Billy May, Joe Sullivan,
I and Zutty Singleton. These jazz
men complement each other's talents
wonderfully and succeed in playing
music that is lar ahead of the pe
riod which they are supposed to
represent. Especially nice is "Big
T's" vocal on "Stars Fell on Ala
bama."
On the third record you will
i hear Red Nichols and his Pennies
doing a very nice bit of "Royal
j Garden Blues" with some great
Heinie Beau clarinet. The re
| verse, "I'm in the Mood for Love,"
I is all Red and his cornet, and is
! very nice except for an unneces-
I sary coda at the end of the side.
Expected to showcase all of early
j Harlem music, the fourth platter is
I nothing more than Ellingtonia—but
great music. Although Duke and
! many of his instrumentalists were
I absent at the cutting session, the
] fine work of Barney Bigard, Sonny
Greer, Otto Hard wick, Fred Guy,
and Taft Jordan make you forget
that men such as Johnny Hodges,
Rex Stewart, and Lawrence Brown
are not present. The tunes, "Mood
Indigo" and"The Mooche," are some
of Ellington's most highly praised;
and in some ways, these sides are
more pleasing than the usual large
band arrangements that accompany
these numbers.
Riding it out is a Kansas City
group lead by pianist Jay Shann.
Featuring a group of relatively
unknown musicians, this record is
below the par set by the rest of
the album, but is actually worth
your attention. With blues shoutcr
Julia Lee doing some nice work
on each side, the tunes are ones
that have been and still are popu
lar.
If the next albums progress in
listening pleasure in the manner of
| the first two, this is a set of records
that no one will want to miss.
