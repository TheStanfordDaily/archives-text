### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 4 (UP).â€”
Kentucky's grizzled Sen. Alben
Barkley today put his weight into
the fight for Palestine as a Jewish
homeland.
'"Hitler and World War II exter
minated 5,000.000 European Jews,"
he asserted at the 20th anniversary
conference of the United Palestine
appeal. "It is estimated 1.500,000 re
main on the continent, homeless,
families broken, suffering terribly
with no place to go. Palestine should
be opened to them."
The Democratic majority leader
sharply criticized the British "white
paper" of 19.')9 which limited Jewish
annually for six years and ended
annually fors ix years and ended
immigration completely last March.
Barkley praised President Tru
man for urging modification of the
Brilish position to allow at least
100.000 Jews annually to enter Pal
estine, but he added that "this is
not enough."
The Paducah statesman paid trib
ute to Jewish enterprise in Pales
tine which has reclaimed the desert
with irrigation and industrialization
largely with funds collected by sym
pathetic Jewish groups in America.
He proposed that integration of dis
placed Nazi victims in Palestine be
financed with reparations paid fcy
loser nations.
Barkley, who shared the speakers'
platform with Rabbi James G. Hel
ler of Cincinnati, national chairman
of the organization, left by plane
for Washington immediately follow
ing his address.
