WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 (UP).—The House Military Affairs Committee
picks up the year's hottest legislative potato (his week when it opens
hearings on a liill to make universal military training mandatory for every
able-bodied youth.
It does so at the urgent request of President Truman. On Oct. 23, the
Chief Executive addressed a message to a joint session of Congress warn
ing that the United States must have a formidable backlog of trained
defenders against possible future aggression.
His recommendations were that every boy who is 18, or has finished
high school, or who has not yet reached his 20th birthday, be given a
year's training, and then placed in a reserve corps for six years. The
only exceptions would be those with "total physical disqualifications.
Congressional opinion tonight is that the presidential recommenda
tions go too far. Congressional elections arc just a year away. The na
tion is now at peace, and the people are more concerned with getting
their sons and husbands back into civilian life than with training their
young brothers for future wars.
