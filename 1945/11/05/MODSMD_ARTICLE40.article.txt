# Squeaky Voice? Lisp? Speech 9 Guarantees Aid
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Can you imitate the dramatic
voice of Orson Wells? Does your
voice rival the deep resonant quali
ty of Talullah Bankhead's? or does
it somewhat resemble the tone pro
duced by squeaking water pipes?
11 your speech is of the latter
variety, or even if your lovely pear
shaped tones delight your listeners,
the Speech and Drama Department
of Stanford University offers a
unique course in Training the
Speaking Voice.
Aims 'fold
The aim of this course is not to
make great public speakers, but to
train the student in developing an
agreeable voice. Many do not realize
what importance a good speaking
voice is, but our voice is one of the
most important mediums through
which we impress the people we
meet.
The student entering Speech 9 for
th" first time is requested to deliver
a short extemporaneous speech, a
poem and a paragraph of difficult
English words, over a recording ma
chine. After hearing his own rec
ord played back, the amazed listen
er feels certain that he is far be
yond any help the speech depart
ment can offer.
'ilottal Shock
However the instructor noting the
discouraged look on his pupil's face
says gently to him, "Now your voice
isn't too bad. It does have a cer
tain breathless and glottal shock
(leaping into each word), and it
does sound rather monotonous and
sing-songy, but aside from that
you'll do all right." The student
shines under this encouragement.
The pupil is delighted with the
new language Speech 9 opens up to
him through his vocal exercises. In
stead of greeting his friends on the
Quad with a common "Hi 'ya" he
salutes them with "H-o-ow n-o-ow
br-o-own c-oâ€”ow." He becomes the
center of attraction when he prac
tices "Murder! Sound the alarm!"
in a vibrant base voice. The peak
of his career is reached when he
finds that he can count to fifty in
one breath.
Student Training Aware
The speaking voice makes the
student aware of the particular
thing he is doing with his voice. He
found that when he entered the
course he could talk fairly well but
couldn't breathe properly; he later
finds he can breathe satisfactorily
but he can't talk.
The speech student's Bible is
"Training the Speaking Voice" by
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, the head

of Stanford's Speech and Drama De
partment. Professor Anderson re
fers to many great actors and ac
tresses such as Julia Marlowe and
Henry Irvine, the English tragedian,
who rose to stardom over speech
defect*. The student feels as though
there is hope for him too as long
as he has a diaphram and a larynx.
Lisp Means Immaturity
The student is amazed to learn
thai in many cases one's personality
and voice go hand in hand. A lisp
denotes emotional immaturity; a
nasal quality in the voice shows a
disagreeable personality; a thin voice
denotes an introvert; a babbling one.
an extrovert.
The novice in the speech depart
ment usually makes at least one trip
to the doctor to have his throat
swabbed after a grueling session of
poking around his larynx trying to
find his cricoid cartilege which his
instructor guaranteed was there.
Tooth Prop
The carpenter skill of the Stan
ford student is put to test in the
carving of a tooth prop. This prop
is placed between the teeth to de
velope pear shaped tones in the
voice. The instructor is filled with
pity for the student who attempts
to shut his mouth in the midst of a
big word with a prop between Iris
veeth.
Two class periods, one practice
lesson, and two lectures comprise
the Speech 9 course. A guest speak
er on voice mechanism or the physics
of the voice conducts one lecture;
the other lectur" helps the student
in the art of relaxation.
'Relax Completely'
The professor instructs him to re
lax completely in the soft plush
chairs of the Little Theatre, to be as
limp as a rag doll and roll his head
around and around. If he is not
yet in a state of complete relaxation,
a fellow classmate will kindly roll
his head around for him. Many
students have found that this process,
however beneficial, is also conducive
to sleep.
So if you are found saying in a
negative nasality," Da sea id calb to-
I dite, lub," Speech 9 can change that
oing to purr.
