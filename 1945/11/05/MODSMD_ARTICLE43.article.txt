# Frank Albert Leads Pre-Flight In 13-13 Tie With Bluejackets
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Frankie Albert passed, tackled, and
field generaled the St. Mary's Pre-
Flight eleven into a 13-13 tie with
the star-studded outfit of Fleet City
yesterday afternoon before a jam
packed Kezar Stadium. The Blue
jackets were figured to overpower
the Moraga Airdevils by constantly
substituting new teams, but the Al
bert-led crew was so closely in the
fray at all times that Lieut. Com
mander William Reinhardt never
dared to substitute too far, although
his team was two deep in All-Amer
ican caliber in some spots. Stadium
chatter at the end of the super
duper torrid football contest was
that Stanford's Frankie was the dif
ference between defeat and the tie
lhat they got out of the game.
The fist six points came early in
the first quarter when Albert re
covered O'Rourke's fumble on the
Fleet City eleven-yard stripe. Three
line plunges, with Eshmont on the
final, brought Pre-Flight into Pay
dirt. The conversion point was
missed.
Sailor Drives Scores
Next team to raise the point ante
was the star-studded sailors of Fleet
City. A sustained GB-yard touch
down march was staged following
the kickofi' after the first touch
down. Steve Juzwig and Harvey
Johnson powerhoused their way on
running plays, with Juzwig, the for
mer Notre Dame grid great, going
over the zero ard line lor points
scorable.
The second and third periods saw
the pigskin bouncing back and forth,
with neither outfit able to hit the

golden territory. Standing out
beautifully for Pre-Flight was Jim
McDonald, the plunging fullback
from Ohio State. His line backing
was nothing short of sensational.
And not to be discounted was the
beautiful tackle made of Buddy
(Now he's tackled, now he's not)
Young, the 9.7 sprint star of Illini
fame. Feinting with Young, Frankie
pulled him down, and if he hadn't
six more points would have been
added to the ledger of Fleet City.
Young (lets Hot
The final quarter started with a
deadlock at Gâ€”(l. Fleet City moved
into a scoring position when Char
ley O'Rourke, the Boston College
flash, intercepted one of Albert's
passes on the bluejacket 22-yard
stripe. Then Young went to town.
Darting all over the eld, dodging
tacklers, skirting the sidelines, he

I went over for a touchdown to put
j Fleet City ahead 13-6, the conver
i sion good this time.
Albert Pulls "Bootleg"
Time was running short and Pre-
Flight started to put on one of their
own drives to come back into the
game. Starting from their own 34-
I yard line, Albert faked a lateral,
and went for 32 yards on a play
! around right end. Deception to the
left was so excellent that seconds
passed before the opposition real
ized Albert was running on the oth
er side on the "bootleg play."
From that spot he passed to Bob
Titchenal on the 14. The next play
was the pay-off. Albert faded back
for a pass, and when the sailors
started to rush him, the ball was

given to Eshmont, a collegiate star
from Fordham, who passed to Bob
Titchenal for a touchdown. Albert
kicked the extra point, and the score
again was deadlocked at 13 points
per pair.
Late in the final quarter Fleet
City scored again, the play was
ruled back, when the end was off
side. Both squads held fast after
that, and the fray ended at that
score of the unlucky figue of 13
apiece.
Albert was the constant spark
plug of his team. Dog-tired at
times, he never let his physical ex
ertion get him down, and he kept
plugging away and in tight spots
the team held like a brick wall.
