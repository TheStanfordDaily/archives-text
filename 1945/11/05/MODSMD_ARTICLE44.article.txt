# Encina Takes League II Title
## 
### 
An underrated Encina II power
house swept to the intramural foot
ball league two title last Friday
by edging a favored and fighting
Hilltop aggregation by a score of
20 io 13.
Piling up all their points in the
first half, the winners successfully
staved off a late drive by the Tyler-
Arthur combination to clinch the
championship.
Lundquist X,eads
Led by Bill Lundquist, Encina
scored their first touchdown on a
sleeper pass play following the op
ening kickoff. Ray Winterhalter
took Lundquist's pass and scamp
ered 35 yards to a touchdown. An
other aerial from Lundquist, this
time to Dave Wheeler, added the
extra point.
Quick to follow up their advant
age. the Encina team charged back
at the Hilltoppers after kicking oft'.
Steve Smith covered an end zone
fumble for six more points and the
Lundquist to Wheeler play again
converted.
Smith Makes it 20-0
Each sextet then put on sustained
drives only to be stopped within a
few yards of the goal lines, but
with the last seconds of the first half
ticking away, Lundquist chucked a
long one to Ed Lefcourt to set up
the third Encina touchdown. The
ever-present Lundquist, who also
played an outstanding defensive line
game, threw a delayed pass to cen
ter Smith to make the count 20 to 0.
Al- RHu led the Encina defense
which stopped the usually high
scoring Hilltop team from tallying
during the whole first half.
Hilltoppers Roar Back
But in the second half, the Encina
pass defense weakened and Frank
Jones flinging the passes, the Hill
toppers rang up two quick scores
and a conversation to threaten what
looked like a secure lead. Ernie
Webb, high scorer in the league, was
a constant threat v/ith his speedy
end sweeps. But the scoring ended
and Encina took the game and league
title home.
PlayofTs between Encina, the Kap
pa-Dee Gee Hashers and the Med
ics will begin shortly to decide the
Stanford intramural football cham
pion.
