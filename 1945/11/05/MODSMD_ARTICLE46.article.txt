By an all important extra point,
a varsity-studded Navy outfit suc
ceeded in ekeing out a 7-6 victory
over the outweighed Army sextet
in a touch football tussle played
last Saturday afternoon in the
stadium.
After a scoreless first half, Coach
Lt. Hal Williams sent his sailors
back onto the field all primed to
score and score they did. On the
first play after receiving the kick
off they hit paydirt as Knight drop
ped back and heaved a long for
ward to Martin, the latter scoring
to complete a fifty yard play. The
extra point, later the point that
meant the difference between a tie
game, was made by the same aerial
combination.
The undaunted soldiers struck
back, however, and with the run
ning and passing of Theis soon
were within scoring range. Their
drive was halted on the one foot
line as Harvey, on the receiving
end of a Theis forward pass, was
stopped minus twelve inches of
the goal.
A few minutes later—Theis—who
incidentally was limping all after
noon with a knee injury that had
threatened to sideline him for the
day—cut loose on a twenty yard end
jaunt. The next play Theis took
to the air and tossed a long one to
Braun who made an exceptional
finger-tip catch just inside the end
zone. Lt. Williams and his navy
boys protested the T.D. vigorously
but referee Bob Kennedy ruled it
O.K. An end run by Bunch for
the extra point was stopped.
