# Stanford-San Jose Hold Sports Day
## 
### 
The W.A.A. Sports Day held here
with San Jose State last Saturday
was very successful, according to
Jean Singlehurst, chairman of the
affair.
Wins credited to representatives
of the two schools tallied up about
even. All the girls who took part
in the Sports Day were said to have
enjoyed the competition in hockey,
tennis, swimming, badminton, and
archery.
During the meet, which was from
10 to 12 Saturday morning, refresh
ments were served to all. Members
of this committee were Phil Levine,
Mary Thompson, and Vicki Ban
ning.
At the W.A.A. meeting last Tues
day, Helen Ridge was elected fresh
man representative.
