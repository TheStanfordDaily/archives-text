"Dig up an angle that will make
this story interesting to Daily
readers." That's what the editor ad
vised us as we set off for Los Ange
les to see what we could find out
concerning the USC-St. Mary's gi
gantic that anyone at Stanford
would care to read.
Well, we looked and looked and
looked again and still couldn't find
an angle. Nobody swiped our axe
yell (Bob Currie please note), Tom
my Trojan did not seem to have a
coat of red paint or even blue. Even
St. Mary's uniforms of red jerseys
and white pants which have re
minded many a football fan of Stan
ford's old grid togs were abandoned
in favor of solid white. Nope, noth
ing happened in the Los Angeles
Coliseum that anyone at Stanford
would be interested in. We might
except several items known as
Herman Wedemeyer, Spike Cordiero
and the Gael eleven.
Only ihe Best
Such matters as those would be
worth noting only to such people as
read the Daily who think St. Mary's
is worth talking about. This might
be quite a few people since just
about everyone who knows says that
it's one of the greatest teams ever
to play football on the west coast
and certainly the best around this
season.
To elucidate: Wedemeyer played
the best game we've seen him in to
date. He heaved his deadly and
justly famous long passes, one for
a total of 51 yards setting up the
Gaels only first half score. It was
typical of the way the Moraga men
do things. On third down, after a
penalty which set them back on their
own 35, Wedey faded to pass. Over
it went to quarterback Denny O'-
Connor who was standing on the
SC 45 waiting for it and down he
went to the ten yard line before
he was stopped.
Trojan Trickery
The scoring play was even pret
tier. O'Connor pulled everybody
but O'Connor up into the line. Even
the Trojans were hunched over the
center set for a line plunge, but
they were wrong. O'Connor took it
from Cuccia, the center, flipped a
quick lateral to Wedemeyer who
was pulling out of the line and
Squirmin' Herman goes over his own
right end with nary a Gael or a
Trojan in sight. And don't think
the 88,000 didn't love that one.
Mighty Mite Cordiero
But Spike Cordiero was the show
stealer in L.A. Saturday with his
amazing breakaway runs through
the massive USC team. One of the
big thrills of the game came along
when the little snake-hipped man
broke loose only to discover that
there were still a half a dozen or
so Trojans bearing down on him.
Anyone else would have said to
himself, "Well, this is as far as I
go," but not the mighty mite. The
only explanation we can give as to

how he got out of that one to con
tinue on for another fifteen yards or
so is to say that he probably closed
his eyes, did a couple of quick walt£
steps and hoped for the best. In his
own words, heard in the locker room
after the game: "There I was, there
were and I was still there."
Bill Leiser of the Chronicle (and
formerly of the Dippy) notwithstand
ing, Cordiero looked good all by
himself and needed only to be
handed the ball and told where to
go for him to get there. Spike av
eraged a very pretty twelve yards
a try which somewhat more than
for a 155 pounder to do against the
beef trust fielded by Southern Cal.
Line-Up Lay-Out
But Wedey and Spike weren't the
only Gaels to cover themselves with
glory last Saturday. Dennis O'Con
nor added to his reputation as a
smart quarterback and top pass re
ceiver in the nation; Henry Van
Gieson, another Hawaiian, who usu
ally is a replacement halfback, start
ed the game at right tackle in place
of the injured Harvey Adair and
shone at that post; Don Adams and
Paul Crowe repeated their perform
ances of the Nevada game by going
into the backfield late in the game
and sparking St. Mary's final touch
down drive.
And certainly not enough can be
said about the way in which the
heavily outweighed Gael forward
wall pushed around the Trojan line
which was twenty pounds heavier
per man. They looked best in their
second period goal line stand which
averted SC's only scoring threat.
Then the crowd knew that St. Mary's
wasn't going to be pushed around
one little bit.
SC Backfield
Morris of Southern Cal's backfield
played a good game, all things be
ing considered. We'd expected it
after seeing him as the only Tro
jan who didn't seem to be asleep,
in their game with Cal earlier in
the season. Ted Tannehill, when he
had a chance to run back the ball
from kickoffs and punts, showed
some steam and Lilly white's passes
looked good even when they were
intercepted by St. Mary's, which was
no avis rara.
But all the glory and honor of
the day belonged to the fighting

men from Moraga. They're smart,
they're tricky, they're fast and they
never fail to please a crowd. As the
flickers would say "They're real
box office." From where we sit,« they
look like a cinch to play in the
Sugar Bowl come New Year's Day.
And to really get ourselves out on
a limb, we'd like to see them play
Alabama which would very defi
nitely be the top bowl game of the
year.—Tommy Carver.

were and I was still there."
Bill Leiser of the Chronicle (and
formerly of the Dippy) notwithstand
ing, Cordiero looked good all by
himself and needed only to be
handed the ball and told where to
go for him to get there. Spike av
eraged a very pretty twelve yards
a try which somewhat more than
for a 155 pounder to do against the
beef trust fielded by Southern Cal.
Line-Up Lay-Out
But Wedey and Spike weren't the
only Gaels to cover themselves with
glory last Saturday. Dennis O'Con
nor added to his reputation as a
smart quarterback and top pass re
ceiver in the nation; Henry Van
Gieson, another Hawaiian, who usu
ally is a replacement halfback, start
ed the game at right tackle in place
of the injured Harvey Adair and
shone at that post; Don Adams and
Paul Crowe repeated their perform
ances of the Nevada game by going
into the backfield late in the game
and sparking St. Mary's final touch
down drive.
And certainly not enough can be
said about the way in which the
heavily outweighed Gael forward
wall pushed around the Trojan line
which was twenty pounds heavier
per man. They looked best in their
second period goal line stand which
averted SC's only scoring threat.
Then the crowd knew that St. Mary's
wasn't going to be pushed around
one little bit.
SC Backfield
Morris of Southern Cal's backfield
played a good game, all things be
ing considered. We'd expected it
after seeing him as the only Tro
jan who didn't seem to be asleep,
in their game with Cal earlier in
the season. Ted Tannehill, when he
had a chance to run back the ball
from kickoffs and punts, showed
some steam and Lilly white's passes
looked good even when they were
intercepted by St. Mary's, which was
no avis rara.
But all the glory and honor of
the day belonged to the fighting

men from Moraga. They're smart,
they're tricky, they're fast and they
never fail to please a crowd. As the
flickers would say "They're real
box office." From where we sit,« they
look like a cinch to play in the
Sugar Bowl come New Year's Day.
And to really get ourselves out on
a limb, we'd like to see them play
Alabama which would very defi
nitely be the top bowl game of the
year.—Tommy Carver.
"Dig up an angle that will make
this story interesting to Daily
readers." That's what the editor ad
vised us as we set off for Los Ange
les to see what we could find out
concerning the USC-St. Mary's gi
gantic that anyone at Stanford
would care to read.
Well, we looked and looked and
looked again and still couldn't find
an angle. Nobody swiped our axe
yell (Bob Currie please note), Tom
my Trojan did not seem to have a
coat of red paint or even blue. Even
St. Mary's uniforms of red jerseys
and white pants which have re
minded many a football fan of Stan
ford's old grid togs were abandoned
in favor of solid white. Nope, noth
ing happened in the Los Angeles
Coliseum that anyone at Stanford
would be interested in. We might
except several items known as
Herman Wedemeyer, Spike Cordiero
and the Gael eleven.
Only ihe Best
Such matters as those would be
worth noting only to such people as
read the Daily who think St. Mary's
is worth talking about. This might
be quite a few people since just
about everyone who knows says that
it's one of the greatest teams ever
to play football on the west coast
and certainly the best around this
season.
To elucidate: Wedemeyer played
the best game we've seen him in to
date. He heaved his deadly and
justly famous long passes, one for
a total of 51 yards setting up the
Gaels only first half score. It was
typical of the way the Moraga men
do things. On third down, after a
penalty which set them back on their
own 35, Wedey faded to pass. Over
it went to quarterback Denny O'-
Connor who was standing on the
SC 45 waiting for it and down he
went to the ten yard line before
he was stopped.
Trojan Trickery
The scoring play was even pret
tier. O'Connor pulled everybody
but O'Connor up into the line. Even
the Trojans were hunched over the
center set for a line plunge, but
they were wrong. O'Connor took it
from Cuccia, the center, flipped a
quick lateral to Wedemeyer who
was pulling out of the line and
Squirmin' Herman goes over his own
right end with nary a Gael or a
Trojan in sight. And don't think
the 88,000 didn't love that one.
Mighty Mite Cordiero
But Spike Cordiero was the show
stealer in L.A. Saturday with his
amazing breakaway runs through
the massive USC team. One of the
big thrills of the game came along
when the little snake-hipped man
broke loose only to discover that
there were still a half a dozen or
so Trojans bearing down on him.
Anyone else would have said to
himself, "Well, this is as far as I
go," but not the mighty mite. The
only explanation we can give as to

how he got out of that one to con
tinue on for another fifteen yards or
so is to say that he probably closed
his eyes, did a couple of quick walt£
steps and hoped for the best. In his
own words, heard in the locker room
after the game: "There I was, there
were and I was still there."

Coliseum that anyone at Stanford
would be interested in. We might
except several items known as
Herman Wedemeyer, Spike Cordiero
and the Gael eleven.
Only ihe Best
Such matters as those would be
worth noting only to such people as
read the Daily who think St. Mary's
is worth talking about. This might
be quite a few people since just
about everyone who knows says that
it's one of the greatest teams ever
to play football on the west coast
and certainly the best around this
season.
To elucidate: Wedemeyer played
the best game we've seen him in to
date. He heaved his deadly and
justly famous long passes, one for
a total of 51 yards setting up the
Gaels only first half score. It was
typical of the way the Moraga men
do things. On third down, after a
penalty which set them back on their
own 35, Wedey faded to pass. Over
it went to quarterback Denny O'-
Connor who was standing on the
SC 45 waiting for it and down he
went to the ten yard line before
he was stopped.
Trojan Trickery
The scoring play was even pret
tier. O'Connor pulled everybody
but O'Connor up into the line. Even
the Trojans were hunched over the
center set for a line plunge, but
they were wrong. O'Connor took it
from Cuccia, the center, flipped a
quick lateral to Wedemeyer who
was pulling out of the line and
Squirmin' Herman goes over his own
right end with nary a Gael or a
Trojan in sight. And don't think
the 88,000 didn't love that one.
Mighty Mite Cordiero
But Spike Cordiero was the show
stealer in L.A. Saturday with his
amazing breakaway runs through
the massive USC team. One of the
big thrills of the game came along
when the little snake-hipped man
broke loose only to discover that
there were still a half a dozen or
so Trojans bearing down on him.
Anyone else would have said to
himself, "Well, this is as far as I
go," but not the mighty mite. The
only explanation we can give as to

how he got out of that one to con
tinue on for another fifteen yards or
so is to say that he probably closed
his eyes, did a couple of quick walt£
steps and hoped for the best. In his
own words, heard in the locker room
after the game: "There I was, there
were and I was still there."
Bill Leiser of the Chronicle (and
formerly of the Dippy) notwithstand
ing, Cordiero looked good all by
himself and needed only to be
handed the ball and told where to
go for him to get there. Spike av
eraged a very pretty twelve yards
a try which somewhat more than
for a 155 pounder to do against the
beef trust fielded by Southern Cal.
Line-Up Lay-Out
But Wedey and Spike weren't the
only Gaels to cover themselves with
glory last Saturday. Dennis O'Con
nor added to his reputation as a
smart quarterback and top pass re
ceiver in the nation; Henry Van
Gieson, another Hawaiian, who usu
ally is a replacement halfback, start
ed the game at right tackle in place
of the injured Harvey Adair and
shone at that post; Don Adams and
Paul Crowe repeated their perform
ances of the Nevada game by going
into the backfield late in the game
and sparking St. Mary's final touch
down drive.
And certainly not enough can be
said about the way in which the
heavily outweighed Gael forward
wall pushed around the Trojan line
which was twenty pounds heavier
per man. They looked best in their
second period goal line stand which
averted SC's only scoring threat.
Then the crowd knew that St. Mary's
wasn't going to be pushed around
one little bit.
SC Backfield
Morris of Southern Cal's backfield
played a good game, all things be
ing considered. We'd expected it
after seeing him as the only Tro
jan who didn't seem to be asleep,
in their game with Cal earlier in
the season. Ted Tannehill, when he
had a chance to run back the ball
from kickoffs and punts, showed
some steam and Lilly white's passes
looked good even when they were
intercepted by St. Mary's, which was
no avis rara.
But all the glory and honor of
the day belonged to the fighting

men from Moraga. They're smart,
they're tricky, they're fast and they
never fail to please a crowd. As the
flickers would say "They're real
box office." From where we sit,« they
look like a cinch to play in the
Sugar Bowl come New Year's Day.
And to really get ourselves out on
a limb, we'd like to see them play
Alabama which would very defi
nitely be the top bowl game of the
year.—Tommy Carver.
