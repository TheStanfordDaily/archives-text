# Yamashita Trial in Second Week
## 
### 
MANILA. Monday, Nov. 5 (UP). â€”Chief defense counsel in the atroc
ity trial of Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita today opened the trial's second
week by trying to break down damaging testimony that Yamashita had
ordered destruction of Manila and massacre of its inhabitants as part of
Japanese strategy for defense of the city.
The testimony was offered in Saturday's session by a witness identi
fied only as "Lapuz," who had been private secretary to (ien. Kicarte,
a revolutionary leader whom the Japanese considered their No. 1 Fili
pino collaborator.
"Lapuz" testified that Yamashita refused to withdraw an order for
the massacre and destruction in Manila despite tearful pleas made by
the Filipino quisling.
When court opened today, Chief Defense Counsel Col. Ha rry F.
Clarke, Altoona. Pa., personally began the cross-examination of "Lapu/."'
in an effort to discredit the collaborator's testimony.
The prosecution staff, headed by Maj. Robert M. Kerr, Portland. Ore.,
objected repeatedly to Clarke's cross-examination of Lapuz.
