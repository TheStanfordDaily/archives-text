# Dean Adds 10 Navy Men To Squad, Emphasizes Offensive in Workouts
## 
### 
After paring his civilian squad
down to around twenty last week,
basketball coach Everett Dean added
ten promising Navy men to his squad
and began instruction in his intri
cate offensive system.
Dean, although he is still work
ing on the fundamentals of the
game, has already started his charges
on the fast break and around-the-

horn plays which use screening and
blocking. This system is character
istic of Stanford's offense, and, with
the correct quintet. Dean could sur
prise a few of the cockier teams
that Stanford meets this season.
A severe jolt was handed Card
chances last week when Joe Owen

and Reed Flickinger, two good
court-men, were unable to pass
the physical.
However, the outlook on the cen
ter position has brightened consid
erably with the appearance of Bill
O'Brien, (i foot 7 inch Bruin a few
years back. His work during last
Friday's scrimmage pleased Coach
Dean.
"Bill showed up well with some
nice hall-handling around the
pivot," said Dean.
"Max King and one of the other
centers might be able to offer O'-
Brien some stiff competition for the
starting post," added the basketball
mentor.
Tom Rodman, injured during
the early tryout period, is hack
in shape and will probably take
an active part in practice in the
next few days.
What type of opposition the Indian
team will face if it has a Coast Con
ference Schedule is not yet known,
but U.C.L.A. and S.C. can be ex
pected to field excellent quintets.
Wilbur Johns, Bruin chief, is

watching five letternien including
Hal Michaels and Dick Hough re
turn to last year's Conference
winning form. Bruin rooters arc
; making no secret <»1 the fact that
they expect another outstanding
team.
Jack Nichols, all-coast center, will
lead S.C. thi.s season. And Wilbur
Price, Cal Coach, will probably turn
out another of his tall rangy teams.
