### 
"Peace, the greatest social wel
fare problem of today, is the only
possible salvation left for the world,"
Mr. Arthur Cassidy, minister of the
Mill Valley Community Church, told
YWCA representatives attending
the intercollegiate Fellowship Con
ference last Saturday in San Fran
cisco.
Mr. Cassidy expressed the need
for the individual's personality to
be caught up in loyalty to some
great cause and added that "the
challenge of working toward a fed
eral world government would fill
that need for the YWCA."
"The only possibility for world
peace," Mr. Cassidy said, "is the
formation of federal union now.
You can't control the atom bomb
without government, and you can't
have government without law,"
he said.
Mr. Cassidy declared that "the
United Nations' Charter was not suf
ficient to control the atom bomb,"
that mutual agreement was not
enough." He stated the need for a
world authority to control the pro
duction of arms and the atom bomb
in particular and added that such
a central power should have more
power than any one nation.
In comparing a federal world
government to national govern
ment. Mr. Cassidy explained, "We
know in our own society that we
don't agree to maintain the public
welfare and then immediately do
away with the police force, and
the court system."
In addition to working for a world
organization the YWCA should strive
to promote a feeling of friendship,
kinship, and devotion to the great
est welfare of all people, Mr. Cas
sidy said.
Representatives from Stanford,
University of California, College
of the Pacific, San Jose State, San
Francisco, and Santa Cruz attend
ed the conference. Stanford's
YWCA sent Louise Phillips, Stan
ford "Y" president, Virginia But
ler. Donna Lapham, Mary Ethel
Robinson, Beatrice Boland, Mary
Virginia Pond, Madeline Brill,
national representative, Pat Whit
tcmorc, conference chairman at
Stanford, and Miss Patricia David
son, "Y" director, to the meeting.
Afternoon discussions centered
around the problem of full employ
ment, race relations, the religious
program in the YWCA, and the in
terpretation of the "Y" program in
all its phases to the public.
It was pointed out in the dis
cussion on full employment that
the problem of employment affect
ed more people than any other
single thing. YWCA representa
tives agreed on the need to reach
the goal of full employment, to
have unemployment compensation,
and public health, and they fav
ored the amendment to the wage
i act recently presented to Con
i gross.
The race relations group demon
strated that economic competition,
fear of difference, the unknown, and
inter-racial marriage, the desire for
a feeling of superiority, and real

ignorance were the greatest barriers
to satisfactory race relations. The
necessity for abolishing these ob
stacles especially in regard to hous
ing problems and full employment
was expressed.
