CHUNGKING, Monday, Nov. 5 |
(UP). —A Chinese Communist force
of 120,000 men armed with Japanese
weapons is marching from three di
rections on Suiyuan province in the
north, Peiping dispatches said today
as new violence broke out in Sin
kiang province and heavy fighting
continued in Honan.
The Peiping dispatch said that a
spokesman for the 12th war zone in
Suiyuan province, commanded by
Gen. Fu Tso-yi, reported the Com
munists advancing on Suiyuan from
the north, east and south. They
were said to be better equipped and
numerically superior to government
forces and led by four crack Com
munist commanders.
The Communists are armed with
Japanese weapons taken from a
supply stored by the Japanese for a
last-ditch fight at Kalgan, in neigh
boring Shansi province, the spokes
man said.
The supplies, seized by the Com
munists in August, included tanks,
2,000 artillery pieces, 20.000 rifles,
2,000 tons of ammunition and food
enough for 200,000 men for 10 years.
More than 30,000 Communist
troops already are assulting the
Suiyuan capital of Kweisui, accord
ing to other reports. The 12th war
zone spokesman said that Gen. Fu
was determined to hold Suiyuan
"at all costs."
Other reports from Peiping said
that American troops there were
restricted to barracks in a state of
alert Saturday night because of ru
mors that Communist forces were
planning an attack on an airfield
held by the Americans. The night
passed without incident but tension
remains, the dispatch said.
Other reports told of outbreaks of
violence in a new quarter of strife
torn China—northwestern Sinkiang,
near the borders of the Kazakh So
viet republic—and said that an esti
mated 60,000 Communist troops
massed along the southern Ilonan
bolder had seized Tsaoyang and
threatened four other cities north
west of Hankow.
The new China daily, Communist
organ, charged today in a headline
that government airplanes had
bombed Shantung, held by Com
munists.
A National military council
spokesman denied the charge as
"crazy, groundless, absurd and ab
solutely untrue." He said that the
Chinese air force had been engaged
in taking over Japanese installations
since Japan's surrender and had not
engaged in combat activity since
that time.

BATAVIA, Java, Monday, Nov. 2
(UP). —Fighting flared anew in this
war-torn capital early today as
British troops fought off looters and
Indonesian snipei's with Bren guns,
rifles and hand grenades.
A strong guard was placed around
the city's downtown buildings.
Indonesian forces fighting a re
turn of Dutch rule suffered at least
3,000 casualties in last week's fight
ing at Soerabaja in which a British
brigadier was killed, it was esti
mated earlier. Late dispatches re
ported isolated skirmishes through
out the island.
Pteports from Soerabaja, now un
der control of an entire division of
British Indian troops, said bodies of
Indonesians still were being found
in canals. A British announcement
said that the tension had relaxed
considerably in the naval base city
and there were indications the local
populace would co-operate with the
British in maintaining order.
The leader of revolting Indone
sians in eastern Java meanwhile
announced that his men would con
tinue fighting "as long as one Dutch
flag is flying in Indonesia." The
British poured reinforcements into
central Java, where thousands of
native troops were reported deploy
ing, possibly for new outbreaks.
Hopes for a resumption of nego
tiations to settle the trouble —pre-
cipitated by the refusal of the Indo
nesians to accept a return of Dutch
rule—were seen in a statement by
the self-proclaimed Indonesian re
public headed by Dr. Achmed Soe
karno that it was possible informal
talks would be resumed with Dutch
officials next week. The Hague last
week announced that Dr. Hubcrtus
J. Van Mook, acting Indies governor,
was acting against the Netherlands
government's wishes in even meet
ing with Soekarno.
Reports from eastern Java said
that rebel leaders in that area, most
of whom have been denounced by
Soekarno, met yesterday.
Dr. Moestopo, eastern Java ex
tremist leader who led last week's
Soerabaja revolt in which British
Brigadier Aubcrtin Mallaby was
killed, broadcast a statement that
the Indonesians' position was more
favorable than that of revolting na
tives in Indo-China because "the
latter is opposing a great power
(France) and the former is only
facing a small nation."
