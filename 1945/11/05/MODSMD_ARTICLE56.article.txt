# Australian Talks of Great Coral Reef in South Pacific
## 
### 
Dr. Theodore C. Roughley, super- j
intendent of fisheries of New South |
Wales, Australia, gave an illustrated
lecture on "Australia's great Bar- 1
rier Reef" Friday afternoon in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall.
In his lecture Dr. Roughley de- :
scribed the Reef and its zoological
inhabitants. The Reef, the greatest j
coral reef in the world, extends for
1250 miles along the coast of
Queensland, Australia.
Fisherman's Paradise
With the exception of the north
ern part of the Reef, the climate is
never too warm even in the sum
mer.
The islands of the Reef are a
fisherman's paradise. An average
catch in two hours consists of about
fifty fish.
The Reef's oysters arc as prolific
as its fish. Mile after mile of oysters
by the millions may be collected
for the getting. They would be ex
ported except for the fact that they
cling to the rocks so hard that they
arc broken when detached.
Camouflage Crab
Crabs as well as oysters are found
in great numbers on the Great Bar
rier Reef. One crab, the spider crab,
camouflages itself by attaching sea
( weed to itself, or sponges depending
upon the surrounding area.

Another one, in order to protect |
itself from its nemies, excretes j
sticky threads to entangle its foes. I
When this method is unsuccessful, !
it gives out its organs, and in ten
days can grow a complete new set. !
Turtles Weigh 1500 Pounds
There are three different types of
turtles on the Reef. One species
grows to weigh 1500 pounds, while
another is used for turtle soup.
Turtle riding is a sport of the is
lands; however, a rider must be
experienced to prevent the turtle
from diving when he is in the
water. The islands grow many types
of tropical fruits including mangoes
and pineapples.
Motion Pictures Shown
The colored motion pictures
showed the many varieties of fish
which inhabit the Reef. Also shown
were pictures of colorful coral and
anemones.
One shellfish was shown secret
ing a red liquid, which it uses as a
smokescreen to protect it from its
enemies.
