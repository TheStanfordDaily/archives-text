## 
### 
Two teams shared first place in
the sophomores' riotous Scavenger
Hunt last Friday night. After ran
sacking (he campus and Palo Alto
for three hours, the two groups
brought in 37 of the 40 articles on
the scavenger list.
Barbara Carter, Betty Welling
ton, B. J. Fitger, Lorainc Pielhop,
Frankie Brown, and Martha
Sehwimley composed one of the
winning teams. The other top group
consisted of B. L. Keeler, Katy
Orme, Art Levinson, Bob Slobe, Al
len Burgi, and Bill Blaisdell.
Prizes Awarded
Tlie first prizes, small Sherlock
Holmes caps and spy glasses, were
awarded at the War Board dance at
the Women's Clubhouse.
Among the articles that the scav
engers had to locate were Dr. Tres
iddcr's signature, a baby's diaper,
various old dance bids, a Cal pen
nant., a Willkie campaign button,
and a piece of cactus from the cac
tus garden. Most of the looters had
a difficult time finding a rooter's
cap and a pair of false eyelashes.
Halls Invaded
The scavengers invaded every hall
on campus in their mad search.
Many bulletin boards were com
pletely empty after the "raiders"
had passed through. Although one
of the articles required was an auto
graph of the mayor of Redwood
City, the thorough searchers discov
ered that the city has no mayor.
Soph excom reports that every
one who participated in the hunt
was enthusiastic about the affair. A
class meeting was held in the Nitery
before the scavengers started raid
ing. Newt Arnold led a few yells
and Bob Stephens, soph president,
presided.
