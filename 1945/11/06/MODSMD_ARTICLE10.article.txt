# Knorr Discusses Rubber Industry in New Book
## 
### 
"Profitable disposal of rubber will be one of the most difficult postwar
trade problems, declares Klaus E. Knorr, associate economist of Stan
ford's Food Research Institute, in his new book, "World Rubber and Its
Regulation," which will be published tomorrow by the Stanford Uni
versity Press. After an exhaustive study of the development, of the

rubber industry with particular em
phasis on international attempts to
regulate the market, Mr. Knorr has
concluded that (he world will only
consume half of Ihc three million
tons which the industry annually
produces.
Synthetic t'rnccsscs
He also traces the growth of Ihc
synthetic rubber industry during
the war, especially in the United
States, and analyzes its chances for
.•survival.
"The shocking experience of a
wartime rubber shortage, combined
with pride of achievement in build
ing so vast an industry in so short
a time, produces practically uni
versal agreement in the United
States to maintain a substantial syn
thetic rubber industry," lie writes.
Supply and Demand
Mr. Knorr says thai for practical
purposes the supply and demand
problem applies to the production
of natural rubber in Southeast Asia
and of synthetic rubber in the
United Stales.
In his analysis of the problem
he concludes that there is a place
for both natural and synthetic rub
bers, but that it is a place to be
arrived at mainly through competi
tion rather than through cartelized
control or nationalistic protection.
