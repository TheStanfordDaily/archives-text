CHUNGKING, Nov. 5 (UP). â€”Chinese Communists charged
today that U.S. Marines have intervened openly in China's un
declared civil war and were fighting side by side with General
issimo Chiang Kai-shek's government troops, but the allegations
were denied quickly by official Chinese and American sources.
The Communist newspaper New China Daily and the Yenan
rddio alleged that American troops and planes machine-gunned
soldiers and civilians in attacks against Communist positions,
and that Americans arrested 11 Communist personnel.
The Central Government Minister of Information, K. C. Wu,
said the Communist charges that armed Americans had inter
vened in China's internal politics were "groundless." Wu told
a press conference that the purpose of the allegations was to
' create hatred between Chinese and Americans," and senti
ment for American withdrawal.
In Washington, D.C., the White House announced President
Truman received word Monday morning from Lt. Gen. Albert
C. Wedemeyer, commanding American forces in China, that
"there have been no clashes between Chinese Communists and
tke Marines." The White House did not elaborate on this brief
statement.
