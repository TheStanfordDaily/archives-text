HOUSING PROGRAM HISTORY
EXPLANATION FOR FRESHMEN
As autumn quarter progresses, freshmen and
other new women may become increasingly
conscious of words such as "Housing Com
mitter.-," "social program," "group congenial
ity," which appear time and again in Women's
Conference minutes, house meetings, or col
umns of the Daily words that may be all too
familiar to upperclass women, but entirely con
fu- iri'j to those who were not on campus last
winter and spring quarters. It was then that a
representative committee of Stanford women
wass entrusted with the job of outlining a work
able plan for the "conversion of former sorority
houses into University units, and the housing
of the unusually large freshman class; main
taining, meanwhile, group congeniality without
resorting to a rushing system."
With that as its goal the committee began
work during winter quarter. Its meetings soon
become focal points of campus interest and
the committee was forced to move to a larger
room to house its audience. Various plans for
room and residence choosing were proposed,
until finally, after much argument, compro
mise, and sound thinking, the committee adopt
ed a plan, later approved by the Board of
Trustees, which includes the following points
that are applicable now:
1. Agreement to have the same lot system
of room choosing for all women's residences.
2. Consideration of casas in Lagunita as
small, separate units.
3. Maintenance of the co-operative living
system in former sorority houses, and inde
pendence of house policy.
A. Recommendation that house bilte be uni
form in all women's residences.
5. Establishment of an all-campus social
program to acquaint freshman women with
types of living units and their members, and
recommendation that an educational program
he set up outlining the duties, advantages,
und disadvantages in all types of living
groups.
This last is the point around which the whole
plan revolves and is the basis for Housing
Committee's social program recommendations
at yesterday's Women's Conference meeting;
for only through acquaintance with residence
members as individuals, knowledge of the
types of living groups, and willingness to ac
cept the responsibilities connected with those
living groups, can Stanford women make the
housing plan function happily.
That's the background, freshmen, of all the
talk you may have heard about "the housing
program." Throughout the year you will be
hearing and learning more about it as the social
program, either planned or informal, is ex
tended to all living groups in a conscious ef
fort to establish conditions which, it is hoped,
will lead to the fulfillment of the plan's ob
jectives; . . the facilitation of congeniality
within a residence so that each woman may feel

herself part of a friendly group . . . the formu
lation of a new social policy which will both
unite women's living groups and provide a
happy way of living for each Stanford woman
