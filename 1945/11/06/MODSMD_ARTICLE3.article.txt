YINGKOW, Manchuria, Nov. 5 (UP).â€”A scheduled confer
ence between Soviet, Chinese government, and U.S. Navy au
thorities to arrange for "safe conduct" of Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek's troops into this Communist-dominated Manchurian
port of entry was called off today when Soviet commanders
failed to appear.

With Gen. Hu Li-ming's Nation
alist 13th Army waiting offshore in
American vessels, and Communists
ashore digging trenches around the
city, the situation here continued in
a state of high tension.
Junior officers of the Soviet gar
rison explained that Col. LeonofT,
garrison commander, had gone to
Mukden, presumably for instruc
tions regarding the Nationalist
claim that the Soviets had guaran
teed a "safe landing" for occupation
troops.
There was a growing impression
among Chinese observers that the
Soviet forces ashore were co-oper
ating with the Communist Eighth
Route Army in fact, if not in name.
The Communists have sworn to
resist any attempt of Nationalist
troops to enter Manchuria.
This was the third day in which
it was impossible to obtain any defi
nite answer from the Soviets re
garding their attitude toward the
arrival of Chungking forces.
