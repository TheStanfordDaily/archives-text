We were delighted when the Quad finally
produced itself after keeping in hiding all these
long months. But we might say it was well
worth waiting for. The photography present
in the opening pages is something which
should be framed. We might say many of the
individual shots aren't exactly the best we've
seen, however.
One particular note confused us no end. It's
that little ditty about Dr. John Pearce Mitchell,
to whom this year's Best Seller was dedicated.
And we quote: "His 46 years at Stanford are
made up of seven years as a student, three
years as an instructor, 37 years as professor of
chemistry, 20 years as registrar of the Univer
sity, pioneer member of the Board of Athletic
Control, and for 27 years guardian of the stu
dent treasuries through his position as secre
tary-treasurer of the Students' Organizations
Fund."
Now I got out my slide rule, consulted an
engineering friend of mine, and figured out that
had Dr. Mitchell graduated from college at
the young age of 20, all this experience noted
above would make him approximately 107
years old. You hold your age so well, Dr.
Mitchell!!!

Weekly movie report: "Mildred Pierce," cur
rently at the Stanford, is worth rushing through
dinner to see. Joan Crawford uses this flick
to good advantage as a vehicle of comeback
after two years vacation from Cinemaland. She
interprets the part with finesse and genuine
realness. Jack Carson is the usual buffoon,
while Zachary Scott, no doubt, v/ill be the topic
of conversation over the dinner table of many
a women's living group for some time to come.

We have an amateur photographer friend
who is bound to clean up a good deal of cash
this quarter if he plays the angles right. It
seems he and his camera were wandering
around one of the local pubs last weekend
and they caught an unusual shot: a half dozen
freshman girls hoisting a sizeable bottle of
brew. It now seems a certain half-dozen Roble
girls are frantically trying to secure the nega
tive, for obvious reasons. A little blackmail,
with a certain third party, and this friend of
mine will be sending money home to the folks.

Weekly movie report: "Mildred Pierce," cur
rently at the Stanford, is worth rushing through
dinner to see. Joan Crawford uses this flick
to good advantage as a vehicle of comeback
after two years vacation from Cinemaland. She
interprets the part with finesse and genuine
realness. Jack Carson is the usual buffoon,
while Zachary Scott, no doubt, v/ill be the topic
of conversation over the dinner table of many
a women's living group for some time to come.

We have an amateur photographer friend
who is bound to clean up a good deal of cash
this quarter if he plays the angles right. It
seems he and his camera were wandering
around one of the local pubs last weekend
and they caught an unusual shot: a half dozen
freshman girls hoisting a sizeable bottle of
brew. It now seems a certain half-dozen Roble
girls are frantically trying to secure the nega
tive, for obvious reasons. A little blackmail,
with a certain third party, and this friend of
mine will be sending money home to the folks.
