MILDRED PIERCE—Ends Wednes

"Mildred Pierce," marking Joan
Crawford's return to the screen un
der the Warner Brothers' banner, is

a seething story
of unimportant
people and their
reactions to love,
hate, and mur
der. The film,
based op James
("Double Indem
ni t y") Ca in's
novel, often re
flects Cain's ev
ery - day bitter-

ness, but at times is infected with
Hollywood over-emotionalism, par-

ticularly the Warner Brothers type.
Joan Crawford, in the title role,
portrays a divorcee who attempts
to manage both a business and her
tempestuous daughted. She becomes
attracted to a well-dressed profes
sional loafer, Zachary Scott, who
soon begins to sponge off Miss
Crawford and causes the degrada
tion of her daughter. It is out of
these seemingly petty details that
the vicious qualities of "Mildred
Pierce" develop.
Mention should be made of the
cunning performance of Ann
Blyth in the role of Miss Craw
ford's daughter. Miss Blyth shows
herself to be quite a "bitch" play
er, second only to Susan Hay
ward.
Jack Carson, who still smacks of
vaudeville, plays his first "heel" role
as Miss Crawford's business partner
and seems a bit out of place. Zach
ary Scott, as the cut-throat lover, is
effective enough.
The musical score is permeated
with the strains of "Can It Be
Wrong?" which formed the chief
background for a previous War
ner picture, "Now Voyager."
"Mildred Pierce," while not an
other "Double Indemnity," is, in its
ironical, hard-bitten moments, a po
tent, convincing production. It will
certainly rank as one of the ten
best serious productions of the wan
ing year.—Dick Bower
