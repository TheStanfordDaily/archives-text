"The Dynamics of Calcium and
Phosphorus Metabolism" will be the
topic of David M. Greenberg, pro
fessor of biochemistry at the Uni
versity of California Medical School,
at the Biological Science depart
ment's weekly seminar tomorrow
afternoon at 4:15.
Professor Greenberg, who received
his training at the University of
California, was a Guggenheim Fel
low. He is interested in the physical
chemistry of proteins, the physiology
of calcium and magnesium, bio
chemistry and analytical methods,
and the physical chemistry of sea
water.
The subject of calcium and phos
phorus metabolism includes diets
involved in the producing and cur
ing of rickets. Artificial radio-active
materials have been produced by
means of the cyclotron at California,
and their deposition in bones has
been studied. Vitamin D is in
volved in the normal deposition of
bones.
The seminar will be preceded by
a tea at 4 p.m. Students, faculty,
and visitors are welcome to attend.
