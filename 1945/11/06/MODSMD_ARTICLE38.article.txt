# Two Choirs Fulfilling Mrs. Stanford's Wishes
## 
### JOANNE O'BRIEN 
Mrs. Leland Stanford expressed a
wish 45 years ago. She wanted a
choir for the beautiful chapel, not
one composed of professional people
paid to sing at the services, but one
made up entirely of students with
enough enthusiasm to form a choir
that would complement Memorial
Church.
This idea which is an ordinary
one now, was prophetic at the time
of Mrs. Stanford. Then very few
universities had a student choir and
Stanford was one of the first pioneers
in "ibis field.
Choir Flourishing
Her wish was granted, and today
the Stanford choir is flourishing as
it never has before. Eighty-five
voices blend in perfect harmony ev
ery Sunday at the ]1 o'clock serv
ice when 50 was the maximum in
years before.
Tryouts are held at the beginning
of each quarter for membership in
the choir. Because of the surplus
of singers, two choirs were formed
thjs year, the first choir, the chancel,
supported by the "celestial" or gal
lery choir. The gallery choir is ac
companied, but the chancel choir
sings all a capella pieces.
Meetings on Thursday
Meetings of the choir are held ev
ery Thursday evening at 7:30 in the
choir room at the rear of Memorial
Chapel. A new president will be

chosen Friday to replace retiring |
Frank Allen. Other officers are
Bonnie Mae Hanson, secretary, and |
John Phillip Ellis, librarian. Marj
ery Johnson, Betty Griswold, Renee
Cohu, and Byron Hovik are part
leaders.
Growth of the choir has been the
result of fine co-ordinated effort |
both on the part of the students
and the supervisors. Warren \
D. Allen, University organist, is j
general director and takes charge of J
the gallery choir while D. Sterling !
Wheelwright, assistant organist, |
leads the chancel choir.
Dresden Amen Hymn
The choir practices on Thursday
evenings and on Sunday morning
before the service. Each section
sings some hymns and anthems
alone, and blend together on others. |
One of the most beautiful is the I

Dresden Amen which follows the
benediction. The first four measures
are sung by the gallery choir and
as a climax the chancel choir re
peats them in a higher key.
Perhaps the most impressive of
services was sung in the spring of
1919 after the armistice had been
declared. Requiem Mass by Verdi
was presented by the choir in hon
or of all those who had fallen on
the battlefields throughout the war.
Other Benefits
"Being in the choir offers other
benefits besides developing the voice,
It tends to round-out the personali
ty, give self-assurance, and build
confidence in the individual," stated
Mr. Allen.
"Many of our members have gone
into their professions and have be
come leaders in their fields," he said.
The singing at the Sunday Serv
ices is greatly enjoyed by all those
who attend, but perhaps it would he
enjoyed more by one who could not
be there, but one who originated the
choir ideaâ€”Mrs. Lcland Stanford.
