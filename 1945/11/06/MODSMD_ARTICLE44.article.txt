# Vow Boys Were End Of An Era
## 
### STU MILLAR 
(This is another in a series of
stories on Stanford gridiron
history.)
Bob Grayson and Bones Hamilton
were gone, hut Coach Tiny Thorn
hill had another Coast Conference
schedule to meet in '3(i. He missed
the Vow Boys more and more as he
realized how green and unseasoned
was the material that would defend
an almost perfect '35 record* that
ended with a Rose Bowl triumph

over Southern Methodist.
Only Joe Vigna, Jimmy Coffis, and
two Vow Boys who were back after
a year layoff, Callaway and Hoos,
remained to hold the team together.
Campus gloom only deepened
when Santa Clara look home a
13-to-0 victory over the "Big Red
Machine" that failed to function
"Gorilla" Gomez led the touch
down parade for the Broncs as
desperation heaves hy the locals
failed narrowly on many plays.
Next Saturday, a supposedly de
moralized Indian grid eleven put up
a terrific struggle against Washing
ton Slate only to go down to defeat
]4-to-13. After some questionable
decisions by the officials. Two Card
touchdowns were annulled in the
last live minutes, but movies showed
at least one of them to be legiti
mate.
Oregon came to the Stadium with
a highly-touted eleven and left with
no better than a 7-to-7 tie as Vigna
ran 4(i yards to a touchdown. But
S.C., vengeful after taking three
straight defeats from the Grayson
aggregations, came back with Ambie
Schindler and scored a 14-to-7 win.
Stanford's turn for revenge came
the next week when the Thorn
hill men met U.C.L.A.. only team
to blyt the '35 record of the Farm
footballers. An inspired Indian
team led by Zagar, Calvelli, and
Coffis, who ran 58 yards for the
last score, poured it on by a con
vincing score of 19-to-6.
Washington was more than enough
opposition. Fated to take the Con
ference title, the Husky eleven was
out for a big score but contented
themselves with a 14-to-14 tie. Za
gar was again outstanding as one
Card touchdown drive covered the
full 100 yards.
Coffis led the Cards to a list

minute 20-to-14 victory over Ore
gon State as preparation for the
big game. Cal this year was de-

tcrmined to take the offensive and
thoroughly completed the task.
The 20-to-4 score was indicative
of the contest which featured nine
intercepted passes by* the Bears.
Vic Bottari and Herwig sparked

the winners, and the Stanford
campus wanted to forget all about
the sad Saturday.
A trek to frozen New York and
a game with the Columbia Lions,
who were that year led by Sid Luck
man, ended one of the less success
ful of the Stanford seasons.

a highly-touted eleven and left with
no better than a 7-to-7 tie as Vigna
ran 4(i yards to a touchdown. But
S.C., vengeful after taking three
straight defeats from the Grayson
aggregations, came back with Ambie
Schindler and scored a 14-to-7 win.
Stanford's turn for revenge came
the next week when the Thorn
hill men met U.C.L.A.. only team
to blyt the '35 record of the Farm
footballers. An inspired Indian
team led by Zagar, Calvelli, and
Coffis, who ran 58 yards for the
last score, poured it on by a con
vincing score of 19-to-6.
Washington was more than enough
opposition. Fated to take the Con
ference title, the Husky eleven was
out for a big score but contented
themselves with a 14-to-14 tie. Za
gar was again outstanding as one
Card touchdown drive covered the
full 100 yards.
Coffis led the Cards to a list

minute 20-to-14 victory over Ore
gon State as preparation for the
big game. Cal this year was de-

tcrmined to take the offensive and
thoroughly completed the task.
The 20-to-4 score was indicative
of the contest which featured nine
intercepted passes by* the Bears.
Vic Bottari and Herwig sparked

the winners, and the Stanford
campus wanted to forget all about
the sad Saturday.
A trek to frozen New York and
a game with the Columbia Lions,
who were that year led by Sid Luck
man, ended one of the less success
ful of the Stanford seasons.


JOE VIGNA
Stanford haekfield stalwart . . . .


TONY CALVELLI
He did his share . . . .
(This is another in a series of
stories on Stanford gridiron
history.)
Bob Grayson and Bones Hamilton
were gone, hut Coach Tiny Thorn
hill had another Coast Conference
schedule to meet in '3(i. He missed
the Vow Boys more and more as he
realized how green and unseasoned
was the material that would defend
an almost perfect '35 record* that
ended with a Rose Bowl triumph

over Southern Methodist.
Only Joe Vigna, Jimmy Coffis, and
two Vow Boys who were back after
a year layoff, Callaway and Hoos,
remained to hold the team together.
Campus gloom only deepened
when Santa Clara look home a
13-to-0 victory over the "Big Red
Machine" that failed to function
"Gorilla" Gomez led the touch
down parade for the Broncs as
desperation heaves hy the locals
failed narrowly on many plays.
Next Saturday, a supposedly de
moralized Indian grid eleven put up
a terrific struggle against Washing
ton Slate only to go down to defeat
]4-to-13. After some questionable
decisions by the officials. Two Card
touchdowns were annulled in the
last live minutes, but movies showed
at least one of them to be legiti
mate.
Oregon came to the Stadium with
a highly-touted eleven and left with
