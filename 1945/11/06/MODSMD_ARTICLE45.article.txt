Since Washington's 13-7 triumph over USC two weeks past,
a lot of big talk has been going round as to the possible Rose
Bowl opponents. The Trojan's 26-0 defeat at the hands of mighty
St. Mary's Saturday, and the Huskies' victory over Oregon prac
tically shoved them right into the coast candidacy for the Rose
Bowl.
COAST TEAMS WEAK
Aside from service teams, the Gaels are the strongest team
or the coast—they beat the men of the Wooden Horse and Cali
fornia. Washington beat SC but was trounced to the tune of 27-14
by the Golden Bears. This leaves some doubt as to the strength
of Washington, but leaves no doubt as to the general overall
weakness of the Coast Conference elevens this year. The Rose
Bowl, which has been since its inauguration, the greatest and
most colorful bowl classic in the United States, looks like a wash
out this year.
There isn't one top team in the country that Washington
could beat at their present strength. Army, Navy, Notre Dame,
Ohio State, Alabama, and a number of the Southwestern Con
ference teams could push the Huskies right off the field. In ad
dition to this, there are several once and twice-beaten teams
that could probably hold their own against Washington. Al
though statistics prevent, USC could undoubtedly make a better
showing in Pasadena than the present prospects.
As to the choice of a contender, Washington doesn't dare
choose a pushover for an opponent; besides, there are no push
overs in the nation that have records outstanding enough to
be asked to the Rose Bowl. There had been some talk of ask
ing Army to come out and play in the "bowl." It has also been
said that it would require an act of Congress to allow the
Cadets to play here. In view of the slaughter at hand, there
seems to be no reason why Congress should waste the gov
ernment's money to enact special legislation, or why the popu
lace should waste their own money to see such a game—in
spite of Army's power as a drawing card.
Either the Sugar Bowl or the Cotton Bowl will be better games,
and it is only too bad that there is no Service Bowl; so that the
customers could see Ail-Americans running around at a dime a
dozen.
GOOD MURAL FINISH
In spite of the fact that murals teams have not taken up the
advantages of mural competition in the same spirit in which in
tramural competition was offered to them, the league has come
to a rather exciting finish. Last Thursday's close decision by the
Med II team over the Army team and Friday's upset of the Hill
toppers by Encina II has changed the championship playoff
complexion completely. In the round robin tourney which is to
commence next week, I think it is safe to say that the Kappa-Dee
Gee's will cop the mythical championship hands down.
"Doc" Mason says that his Medic 1 team will take on any
of the top teams in,any league at any time. The Medics have
been going great guns since they were heavily decisioned by
the Kappa-Dee Gee's in their game, which was played right
after they returned to school.

Either the Sugar Bowl or the Cotton Bowl will be better games,
and it is only too bad that there is no Service Bowl; so that the
customers could see Ail-Americans running around at a dime a
dozen.
GOOD MURAL FINISH
In spite of the fact that murals teams have not taken up the
advantages of mural competition in the same spirit in which in
tramural competition was offered to them, the league has come
to a rather exciting finish. Last Thursday's close decision by the
Med II team over the Army team and Friday's upset of the Hill
toppers by Encina II has changed the championship playoff
complexion completely. In the round robin tourney which is to
commence next week, I think it is safe to say that the Kappa-Dee
Gee's will cop the mythical championship hands down.
"Doc" Mason says that his Medic 1 team will take on any
of the top teams in,any league at any time. The Medics have
been going great guns since they were heavily decisioned by
the Kappa-Dee Gee's in their game, which was played right
after they returned to school.
Since Washington's 13-7 triumph over USC two weeks past,
a lot of big talk has been going round as to the possible Rose
Bowl opponents. The Trojan's 26-0 defeat at the hands of mighty
St. Mary's Saturday, and the Huskies' victory over Oregon prac
tically shoved them right into the coast candidacy for the Rose
Bowl.
COAST TEAMS WEAK
Aside from service teams, the Gaels are the strongest team
or the coast—they beat the men of the Wooden Horse and Cali
fornia. Washington beat SC but was trounced to the tune of 27-14
by the Golden Bears. This leaves some doubt as to the strength
of Washington, but leaves no doubt as to the general overall
weakness of the Coast Conference elevens this year. The Rose
Bowl, which has been since its inauguration, the greatest and
most colorful bowl classic in the United States, looks like a wash
out this year.
There isn't one top team in the country that Washington
could beat at their present strength. Army, Navy, Notre Dame,
Ohio State, Alabama, and a number of the Southwestern Con
ference teams could push the Huskies right off the field. In ad
dition to this, there are several once and twice-beaten teams
that could probably hold their own against Washington. Al
though statistics prevent, USC could undoubtedly make a better
showing in Pasadena than the present prospects.
As to the choice of a contender, Washington doesn't dare
choose a pushover for an opponent; besides, there are no push
overs in the nation that have records outstanding enough to
be asked to the Rose Bowl. There had been some talk of ask
ing Army to come out and play in the "bowl." It has also been
said that it would require an act of Congress to allow the
Cadets to play here. In view of the slaughter at hand, there
seems to be no reason why Congress should waste the gov
ernment's money to enact special legislation, or why the popu
lace should waste their own money to see such a game—in
spite of Army's power as a drawing card.
