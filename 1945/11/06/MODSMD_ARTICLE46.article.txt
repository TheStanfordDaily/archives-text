# Anderson To Assist Dean
## 
### 
It now seems to be official that
Forrest "Fordy" Anderson, who
played under Coach Everett Dean
from 1539 to 1941, will be assistant
coach for the Indian cage squad this
year. Fordy was voted coach of the
year last season when he coached
Great Lakes through a great season,
and he knows his basketball upside
down.
Dean worked on defense today,
and announced to the squad that
there would be some practice
{{amcs played in the near future,
probably before Thanksgiving va
cation. The Pacific Coast Confer
ence schedule has not been an
nounced yet, but Stanford is defi
nately going to be in it.
Dean, who is noted for his success
in the fast break and general over
all offense, begins to show that he
knows a lot about defense; the boys
were plenty tired after running up
and down the floor for 10 minutes
in a not-too-successful scrimmage.
