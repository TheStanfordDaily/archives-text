# Cadets, Commandos Able Foes for Cards
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Focusing the gridiron telescope in
to the proper perspective, we find
Marchie Schwartz, ably assisted by
Fred Scribner and Fritz Wilcox, a
Schwartz - tutored scatback from
Creighton, trying hard to get the
Indian squad into good shape for
their first grid encounter on Nov.
17. No suitable opponent was avail
able for the coming Saturday, so
instead, an intra-squad scrimmage
is on the docket. The finer points
of the T formation plays are being
ironed out, and blocking and fak
ing being emphasized. The back
field men were showing a consider
able lack of faking in going through
their plays, and also looked weak
on blocking.
Ashley, Barry Look Good
No starting backfield has been an
nounced yet, but yesterday's prac
tice showed very good running by
Fred Willey from the fullback slot;
Tom Ashley, hitting it off well from
the left halfback post; and Dick
Barry blocking well on the passing
plays from light halfback. The
Cardinal eleven meet the Stockton
| Commandos on Nov. 17, and from
! rumors gathered here and there, the
squad has been strengthened recent
ly by the addition of' seven men
from West Point, who played on the
team with the Glenn Davis-Doc
Blanchard combination. If this re
port is true, the squad from Stan
ford way will really be in for an
afternoon of real football.
Cadets Undefeated
The second opponent, the San
I Mateo Merchant Marine Academy,
won their fourth straight contest
last Sunday when they whipped Sa
linas J.C. This win might not be
cause for a dazzling display of py
rotechnics, as the Cal Ramblers
smothered the junior college of Sa
linas to the tune of 32-0. And the
Ramblers are inferior to the varsity,
which isn't worth much this year,

and probably doesn't rate with a
good pre-war Rambler squad. (This
is gettin' mighty confusing, so we'll
stop now.) But getting back to the
subject, Stanford will have its hands
lull when they run against the
Emory S. Land club on the first day
of the last month of the year.
Strictly Within the Law?
Turning south we see that USC
is taking a complete drubbing from
the fourth estate, besides having
been beaten down by the hot Mora
ga gang headed by Herman Wede
meyer. This time it's for using Jim
Callanan and Harry McKinney,
their two star ends in last Saturday's
tilt. The two gridders were ordered
to report to San Francisco next
week for a further naval assign
ment. But they had time to spend
the week-end in Los Angeles, so
they "registered" Thursday at USC,
re-checked out uniforms, played
Saturday's game as full-fledged
members of the Trojan student body,
and at the end of game time, checked
out of school, and quietly booked
passage for San Francisco. The
whole deal was most legal in its
technical aspects. Oh, yes. But the
sooner the University of Southern
California learns that this kind of
legal bamboozling is out of date, the
better off football will be in general.
