# Member of Indonesian Committee Discusses Movement for Freedom
## 
### NONA THOMAS 
"I should like to stress the fact
that an organized national move
ment has existed for fifty years in
Indonesia," says Mr. Alibasah of
Palo Alto, a member of the Indon
esian Committee for Independence,
"and that the Indonesian revolu
tion is only one part of a move
ment for freedom from colonial rule
that is widespread throughout East
ern Asia." He lists as specific causes
for the rebellion Dutch suppression
of the National movement, exploita
tion of native labor, failure to edu
cate the native population, and non
representational government.

"The policy of the Dutch is
neither liberal nor conservative,"
he says. ''Rather they try to sup
press potential national leaders by
discrediting them or by having
them deported. Anyone who
criticizes the government is jailed
and the advocates of independ
ence arc sent without trial to
concentration camps in New
Guinea.
Filipinos Compared
"Virtual slave labor is common.
Laborers earn from 15 to 30 cents
per day, and strikes are forbidden
by law. Poor people must work for
a period in lieu of paying taxes."

In comparing the educational op
portunities ofTered Filipinos with
those of the Indonesians, Mr. Ali
basah said, "The Philippines have
a literacy rate of more than 50 per
cent after forty years under Am
erican government, in comparison
with the Indonesian literacy rate of
less than 6 per cent after more than
300 years under Dutch rule." Ac
cording to Mr. Alibasah, the Dutch
government has on occasion forbid
den the founding of schools by na
tives.
Of the political set-up in Indon
esia he said that the People's
Council "has been more a safety
valve for the Empire than a rep
resentational legislative body for
the country. This council is com
posed of 25 Dutch members rep
resenting 250 thousand Dutch, and
30 native members representing
70 million Indonesians," he con
tinued. v but of the 30 native mem
bers, 20 arc appointed by the Dutch
Governor General, who also has
absolute veto power over any leg
islation made by the Council."
Answering the question of,wheth
er a free Indonesian Republic could
preserve order among the many re
ligious and political groups found in
the country, Mr. Alibasah said that
he feels unity among them to be
possible. In support of his conten
tion, he points out that the mem
bers of Socrkano's cabinet are of
divergent religions and political
parties and that they come from
various geographical areas in In
donesia. He said "Six of the major
political parties are represented in
the Cabinet, and there are Chris
tians and Mohammedans alike and
men from Sumatra, Java, Celebes,
Sunda, and Batak among its mem
bers.
Specific Examples
As specific examples, Mr. Alibasah
pointed out that Soerkano, presi
dent of the "Indonesian Republic"
is a Javanese Mohammedan who
has been trained in engineering and
philosophy and who has several
times been offered governmental po
sitions by the Dutch administra
tion; Hatta, the Vice President, is
a Sumatran Mohammedan, and has
been an ardent socialist-democrat
and nationalist since college,
and Wiranata, the Minister of In
terior, has been a "loyal Dutch
servant for many years" and served
both as Chairman of the Indonesian
Civil Service Association and as a
member of the Cabinet of the Gov
ernor General before the war.
Continuing, Mr. Alibasah said that
Otto Iskander is a Sundanese who
served on the People's Council un
der the Dutch administration; Mara
mis is a Christian from the Cele
bes, and a member of the Repub

lican party, and SjarifTudin, also a
Christian, is by profession a lawyer,
and has been active against the
Japanese, by whom he was impris
oned for three years.
Mr. Alibasah stressed his feel
ing that the presence of SjarifTu
din, an anti-Japanese Indonesian,
on Soerkano's cabinet refutes the
charge that Soerkano acted as a
quisling during the Japanese oc
cupation. "For," he said," "had
Soerkano been a traitor. Indones
ians like SjarifTudin would have
been the first to repudiate him."
Continuing his discussion of Indo
nesian unity, he said, "There is no
race problem in Indonesia; we have
had no race riots. Nor has religion
ever been a national question such
as it is in India; and as for the po
litical parties, each has members
in all parts of Indonesia." Mr. Ali
basah also emphasized the adoption
of Malay as the national language
as important to the unification of
Indonesia. "I predict," he said, "that
Malay will be a very important lan
guage in the Far East in the future
despite Dutch opposition."
Bread and Butter
In conclusion Mr. Alibasah said,
"Indonesia is the bread and butter
of Holland. Without her Holland
would be nothing but a grassland
containing a few cows surrounded
by sand dunes. In 1939 the Dutch
investment in Indonesia was four
billion florins, but each year there
to four hundred million florins
worth of trade flows to Holland. If
Indonesia becomes independent,
trade with America will be approved
and American investors will be wel
come, for Indonesia will need both
American capital and the help of
American experts.
"Though the immediate outcome
of the revolution depends upon
the conference with the Dutch,
Indonesia docs not desire
Dutch rule, and, should Holland
retain control there, the seeds of
future war in the Pacific will be
firmly planted."
Finally Mr. Alibasah expressed his
feeling that the restoration of Dutch
rule in Indonesia would be contrary
to the principle of.self determina
tion expressed in the Atlantic Char
ter, at Yalta, at Teheran, and in
the San Francisco Charter.
He advises anyone who desires
further information on the Indo
nesian viewpoint may obtain it from
him at 1005 Bryant Street in Palo
Alto, and announced that the Indo
nesian Committee for Independence
will shortly publish a booklet to be
advertised in various local news
papers.

two articles on the Indonesian re
bellion. The second, presenting
the point of view of the Nether
lands, will appear tomorrow.—

will shortly publish a booklet to be

"I should like to stress the fact
that an organized national move
ment has existed for fifty years in
Indonesia," says Mr. Alibasah of
Palo Alto, a member of the Indon
esian Committee for Independence,
"and that the Indonesian revolu
tion is only one part of a move
ment for freedom from colonial rule
that is widespread throughout East
ern Asia." He lists as specific causes
for the rebellion Dutch suppression
of the National movement, exploita
tion of native labor, failure to edu
cate the native population, and non
representational government.

"The policy of the Dutch is
neither liberal nor conservative,"
he says. ''Rather they try to sup
press potential national leaders by
discrediting them or by having
them deported. Anyone who
criticizes the government is jailed
and the advocates of independ
ence arc sent without trial to
concentration camps in New
Guinea.
Filipinos Compared
"Virtual slave labor is common.
Laborers earn from 15 to 30 cents
per day, and strikes are forbidden
by law. Poor people must work for
a period in lieu of paying taxes."

In comparing the educational op
portunities ofTered Filipinos with
those of the Indonesians, Mr. Ali
basah said, "The Philippines have
a literacy rate of more than 50 per
cent after forty years under Am
erican government, in comparison
with the Indonesian literacy rate of
less than 6 per cent after more than
300 years under Dutch rule." Ac
cording to Mr. Alibasah, the Dutch
government has on occasion forbid
den the founding of schools by na
tives.
Of the political set-up in Indon
esia he said that the People's
Council "has been more a safety
valve for the Empire than a rep
resentational legislative body for
the country. This council is com
posed of 25 Dutch members rep
resenting 250 thousand Dutch, and
30 native members representing
70 million Indonesians," he con
tinued. v but of the 30 native mem
bers, 20 arc appointed by the Dutch
Governor General, who also has
absolute veto power over any leg
islation made by the Council."
Answering the question of,wheth
er a free Indonesian Republic could
preserve order among the many re
ligious and political groups found in
the country, Mr. Alibasah said that
he feels unity among them to be
possible. In support of his conten
tion, he points out that the mem
bers of Socrkano's cabinet are of
divergent religions and political
parties and that they come from
various geographical areas in In
donesia. He said "Six of the major
political parties are represented in
the Cabinet, and there are Chris
tians and Mohammedans alike and
men from Sumatra, Java, Celebes,
Sunda, and Batak among its mem
bers.
Specific Examples
As specific examples, Mr. Alibasah
pointed out that Soerkano, presi
dent of the "Indonesian Republic"
is a Javanese Mohammedan who
has been trained in engineering and
philosophy and who has several
times been offered governmental po
sitions by the Dutch administra
tion; Hatta, the Vice President, is
a Sumatran Mohammedan, and has
been an ardent socialist-democrat
and nationalist since college,
and Wiranata, the Minister of In
terior, has been a "loyal Dutch
servant for many years" and served
both as Chairman of the Indonesian
Civil Service Association and as a
member of the Cabinet of the Gov
ernor General before the war.
Continuing, Mr. Alibasah said that
Otto Iskander is a Sundanese who
served on the People's Council un
der the Dutch administration; Mara
mis is a Christian from the Cele
bes, and a member of the Repub

lican party, and SjarifTudin, also a
Christian, is by profession a lawyer,
and has been active against the
Japanese, by whom he was impris
oned for three years.
Mr. Alibasah stressed his feel
ing that the presence of SjarifTu
din, an anti-Japanese Indonesian,
on Soerkano's cabinet refutes the
charge that Soerkano acted as a
quisling during the Japanese oc
cupation. "For," he said," "had
Soerkano been a traitor. Indones
ians like SjarifTudin would have
been the first to repudiate him."
Continuing his discussion of Indo
nesian unity, he said, "There is no
race problem in Indonesia; we have
had no race riots. Nor has religion
ever been a national question such
as it is in India; and as for the po
litical parties, each has members
in all parts of Indonesia." Mr. Ali
basah also emphasized the adoption
of Malay as the national language
as important to the unification of
Indonesia. "I predict," he said, "that
Malay will be a very important lan
guage in the Far East in the future
despite Dutch opposition."
Bread and Butter
In conclusion Mr. Alibasah said,
"Indonesia is the bread and butter
of Holland. Without her Holland
would be nothing but a grassland
containing a few cows surrounded
by sand dunes. In 1939 the Dutch
investment in Indonesia was four
billion florins, but each year there
to four hundred million florins
worth of trade flows to Holland. If
Indonesia becomes independent,
trade with America will be approved
and American investors will be wel
come, for Indonesia will need both
American capital and the help of
American experts.
"Though the immediate outcome
of the revolution depends upon
the conference with the Dutch,
Indonesia docs not desire
Dutch rule, and, should Holland
retain control there, the seeds of
future war in the Pacific will be
firmly planted."
Finally Mr. Alibasah expressed his
feeling that the restoration of Dutch
rule in Indonesia would be contrary
to the principle of.self determina
tion expressed in the Atlantic Char
ter, at Yalta, at Teheran, and in
the San Francisco Charter.
He advises anyone who desires
further information on the Indo
nesian viewpoint may obtain it from
him at 1005 Bryant Street in Palo
Alto, and announced that the Indo
nesian Committee for Independence

Finally Mr. Alibasah expressed his
feeling that the restoration of Dutch
rule in Indonesia would be contrary
to the principle of.self determina
tion expressed in the Atlantic Char
ter, at Yalta, at Teheran, and in
the San Francisco Charter.
He advises anyone who desires
further information on the Indo
nesian viewpoint may obtain it from
him at 1005 Bryant Street in Palo
Alto, and announced that the Indo
nesian Committee for Independence
will shortly publish a booklet to be
advertised in various local news
papers.

"I should like to stress the fact
that an organized national move
ment has existed for fifty years in
Indonesia," says Mr. Alibasah of
Palo Alto, a member of the Indon
esian Committee for Independence,
"and that the Indonesian revolu
tion is only one part of a move
ment for freedom from colonial rule
that is widespread throughout East
ern Asia." He lists as specific causes
for the rebellion Dutch suppression
of the National movement, exploita
tion of native labor, failure to edu
cate the native population, and non
representational government.

"The policy of the Dutch is
neither liberal nor conservative,"
he says. ''Rather they try to sup
press potential national leaders by
discrediting them or by having
them deported. Anyone who
criticizes the government is jailed
and the advocates of independ
ence arc sent without trial to
concentration camps in New
Guinea.
Filipinos Compared
"Virtual slave labor is common.
Laborers earn from 15 to 30 cents
per day, and strikes are forbidden
by law. Poor people must work for
a period in lieu of paying taxes."

In comparing the educational op
portunities ofTered Filipinos with
those of the Indonesians, Mr. Ali
basah said, "The Philippines have
a literacy rate of more than 50 per
cent after forty years under Am
erican government, in comparison
with the Indonesian literacy rate of
less than 6 per cent after more than
300 years under Dutch rule." Ac
cording to Mr. Alibasah, the Dutch
government has on occasion forbid
den the founding of schools by na
tives.
Of the political set-up in Indon
esia he said that the People's
Council "has been more a safety
valve for the Empire than a rep
resentational legislative body for
the country. This council is com
posed of 25 Dutch members rep
resenting 250 thousand Dutch, and
30 native members representing
70 million Indonesians," he con
tinued. v but of the 30 native mem
bers, 20 arc appointed by the Dutch
Governor General, who also has
absolute veto power over any leg
islation made by the Council."
Answering the question of,wheth
er a free Indonesian Republic could
preserve order among the many re
ligious and political groups found in
the country, Mr. Alibasah said that
he feels unity among them to be
possible. In support of his conten
tion, he points out that the mem
bers of Socrkano's cabinet are of
divergent religions and political
parties and that they come from
various geographical areas in In
donesia. He said "Six of the major
political parties are represented in
the Cabinet, and there are Chris
tians and Mohammedans alike and
men from Sumatra, Java, Celebes,
Sunda, and Batak among its mem
bers.
Specific Examples
As specific examples, Mr. Alibasah
pointed out that Soerkano, presi
dent of the "Indonesian Republic"
is a Javanese Mohammedan who
has been trained in engineering and
philosophy and who has several
times been offered governmental po
sitions by the Dutch administra
tion; Hatta, the Vice President, is
a Sumatran Mohammedan, and has
been an ardent socialist-democrat
and nationalist since college,
and Wiranata, the Minister of In
terior, has been a "loyal Dutch
servant for many years" and served
both as Chairman of the Indonesian
Civil Service Association and as a
member of the Cabinet of the Gov
ernor General before the war.
Continuing, Mr. Alibasah said that
Otto Iskander is a Sundanese who
served on the People's Council un
der the Dutch administration; Mara
mis is a Christian from the Cele
bes, and a member of the Repub

lican party, and SjarifTudin, also a
Christian, is by profession a lawyer,
and has been active against the
Japanese, by whom he was impris
oned for three years.
Mr. Alibasah stressed his feel
ing that the presence of SjarifTu
din, an anti-Japanese Indonesian,
on Soerkano's cabinet refutes the
charge that Soerkano acted as a
quisling during the Japanese oc
cupation. "For," he said," "had
Soerkano been a traitor. Indones
ians like SjarifTudin would have
been the first to repudiate him."
Continuing his discussion of Indo
nesian unity, he said, "There is no
race problem in Indonesia; we have
had no race riots. Nor has religion
ever been a national question such
as it is in India; and as for the po
litical parties, each has members
in all parts of Indonesia." Mr. Ali
basah also emphasized the adoption
of Malay as the national language
as important to the unification of
Indonesia. "I predict," he said, "that
Malay will be a very important lan
guage in the Far East in the future
despite Dutch opposition."
Bread and Butter
In conclusion Mr. Alibasah said,
"Indonesia is the bread and butter
of Holland. Without her Holland
would be nothing but a grassland
containing a few cows surrounded
by sand dunes. In 1939 the Dutch
investment in Indonesia was four
billion florins, but each year there
to four hundred million florins
worth of trade flows to Holland. If
Indonesia becomes independent,
trade with America will be approved
and American investors will be wel
come, for Indonesia will need both
American capital and the help of
American experts.
"Though the immediate outcome
of the revolution depends upon
the conference with the Dutch,
Indonesia docs not desire
Dutch rule, and, should Holland
retain control there, the seeds of
future war in the Pacific will be
firmly planted."
