# School of Health Aids Farm Student Welfare
## 
### 
Stanford's school of health has become a great aid to the welfare of
the students in the past few years. The department is divided into six
divisions which include Health Education, Public Health Service, Student
Health Service, Athletic Management, Physical Education and Physical
Therapy. Students who enroll in the health field may get advanced de-

grees in physical education, hygiene,
and physical therapy.
Among the hygiene courses open
to men and women are nutrition,
mental hygiene, first aid and prob
lems of health service. Physical edu
cation courses cover methods of offi
ciating in athletic contests, preven
tion and care of athletic injuries and
programs of physical educations ac
tivities. Physical therapy which
during the war and now, with the
return of injured veterans, has be
come an extremely important field
includes courses in therapy, thera
peutics, massage, kinesiology, and
electrotherapy.
Gym Teachers Needed
Since the draft has proven defi
nitely that the health of the nation
is bad more qualified physical in
structors are needed in the school
system. Instead of having a teacher
substitute as a gym instructor, the
colleges throughout the nation are
trying to send out more physical
education majors said Dr. O. N. An
derson, director of the school of
health. The field of health has a
wide variety of positions available
at the present time.
Stanford's public health service
controls communicable diseases,
safety of water supply, sanitation,
and inspection of rooming houses
on and off the campus. Health ex
aminations are given in the fall to
every new student entering the uni
versity, by the student health serv
ices. They also give examinations
to men participating in school ath
letes.
Students Consult Professors
Students are coming to consult
the professors in the school of health
about domestic and health .problems.
The health department now is not
considered as some place to go just
when you arc sick. Dr. Anderson
and his staff want the men and
women to come in and 'talk it over'
with them anytime.
