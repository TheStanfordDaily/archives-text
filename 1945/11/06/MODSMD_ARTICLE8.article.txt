ture discussion.
Sylvia Davis, chairman of Wom
en's Council, reported that there
have been 19 lock-outs on 2 a.m.
late leaves since they were adopted
without restrictions. "There is a

tendency for students to be careless
with these leaves," she said, "and
there will be little chance for stu
dents to have later leaves if they
cannot control these." She also
stressed that. Little Theater late
leaves are to be taken only for plays
in the Little Theater, not for those
in Memorial Auditorium.
Sophomore Vocom
Mary Ed Davis, chairman of Vo
com, announced that a sophomore
Vocom will be started right away,
as well as the regular Vocom, with
a member from each living group.
Sophomores will be in on the plan
ning this year, she said, and will not
do only routine jobs.
Vocom has issued a questionnaire
to every woman student for sug
gestions on speakers and topics for
their programs. Speakers this year
will be experts in their fields and
students who have just been grad
uated from some department, so
they can talk about the require
ments for certain positions.
