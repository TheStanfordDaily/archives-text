# Wallace Stegner Interprets Moods Of Frost, 'Poet of Place, People'
## 
### 
Reading from the poetry of Rob- j
ert frost, Wallace Sterner, acting
professor of English, chose poems
intended to show the moods of Frost
as a "poet of place and people" at
the poetry reading yesterday.
Positive Attitude
Of this contemporary poet, Mr.
Stegner said that even in his black
est moods he takes a positive atti
tude toward the world.
Mr. Stegner began his reading
with the nature lyric, "Spring i
Pools." Following that he read a
long dialogue poem, "Death of the
Hired Man"; "The Code," which is
an amusing local poem about hay
ing; local philosophy in the "Mend- ]
ing Wall"; and "Birches," which
makes country experiences more
clastic.
Philosophy, Humor
The personal philosophy of Frost
is illustrated in "Drumelin Wood
chuck." Frost's lighter side is
shown in the amusing poem about
ants, "Departmental."
The next poem that was read was
"A Considerable Speck," which was
written after a lady had spent an |
evening trying to convert Frost to
Communism. Mr. Stegner said
Frost read this poem to him the
next morning at the breakfast table.
The Road Not Taken'
Mr. Stegner continued the reading

with "Desert Placcs," a moody
poem; "Leaf T reader," about
thoughts of living; and"The Road
Not, Taken," which shows Frost's
sense of dedication in his ambition.
According to Mr. Stegncr, Frost
never surpassed his lyric, "Stop
ping by Woods on a Snowy Eve
ning," which is an expression of |

duties. The next poems read were
"Happiness Makes Up in Height
What It Lacks in Length," "I Could
Give All to Time," and "Come In."
A Fitting Fpitapli
Mr. Stegner concluded with the
last five lines of the Phi Beta Kappa
poem, "Lesson for Today," from
which he stated the line "I had a
lovers' quarrel with the world" to
be a fitting epitaph for Frost.
