# Rally Com Directs Toyon Sailors' Yells
## 
### 
Navy students made Toyon's walls resound last night when they joined
Newt Arnold in Stanford songs and yells at a small rally sponsored by
Rally Com.

The committee is backing a drive to teach every Farm student the
school's songs and yells. As part of the campaign Rally Com visited
Roble Monday night, Toyon last + ' ~~~ "

night, and will go to Encina tonight.
Service Students
According to Eugene Mitguard,
co-chairman of Rally Com, the serv
ice students must feel that they
are a real part of Stanford. The
committee decided that the best way
to build up enthusiasm was to go to
these students at their living groups.
Rally Com urges every civilian
student at Stanford to learn the
songs. Unless everyone knows them,
the first football rally cannot be a
success, say the committee's chair
men, Mitguard and Pat Whittemore.
Should Learn Yells
When Newt Arnold leads the yells
at the Indian games this quarter,
the student body must be able to
follow him. At the athletic rally
a month ago, very few people knew
the spell yell. Rally Com hopes
to correct this situation by giving
the small rallies at the living groups.
Seven members of the committee
went to Toyon last night: Chairman
Mitguard, Barbara Cooper, Illie
Costigan, Phyllis Graham, Gail
Templeton, Dob Currie, and Bill
Blaisdell.
Encina Rally
Encina's rally tonight will be led
by Dot Hodges, Michael Minchin,
Judy Peake, Patty Robinson, Mar
garet Bemis, Wally McCall, and
Sam Streeter.
