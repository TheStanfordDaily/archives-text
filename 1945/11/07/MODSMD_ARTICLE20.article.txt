# Film 'Stolen' By Beavers
## 
### 
Two beavers, "Bertha" and her
husband, stole the show last night
at the Tuesday Evening Scries from
the geysers, spectacular waterfalls,
and even the baby deer which
abound in Yellowstone National
Park as shown in the film "Our Her
itage in the Rockies."
Mrs. 2dna Maslowski's lecture,
accompanying the colored films
taken by her and her husband Karl,
was a rapidly moving commentary
on their often humorous, always
entertaining, experiences in the
Park.
Beaver Dam
Climbing to the top of Mt. Sep
ulchre the couple found a mountain
river da,"mined by the work of bea
vers. They were fortunate, the lec
turer said, to find the creatures at
work during the day when they
could be filmed.
"Bertha" was not beautiful, being
shaggy and pig-eyed, Mrs. Mas
lowski said; but she could gnaw
a branch through in record time.
While she heaved mud from the
bottom of the pool to strengthen the
dam and hauled branches, her in
dolent. husband munched leaves.
Geysers Gurgle
Among the natural phenomena
which immediately marked the
northern Wyoming area as suitable
for the first national p;irk in the
country, when discovered by ex
plorers, were the geysers and other
"thermal attractions" such as pools |
of bubbling mud. Fascinating to I
adults as well as children are "Old j
Faithful's" regular eruptions and j
the more unpredictable gurglings j
and ploppings of the viscous pools.
Taken from strategic angles, the
couple's pictures of the big horn
sheep, the elk, the antelope and
their bewildered offspring moved
the audience with admiration and
amusement.
Flowers Photographed
Wild flowers photographed near
the snow line on Yellowstone's
mountains included the exquisite
pink Bitter Root.
Shy ground-squirrels and not-so
shy coyotes were filmed under
sometimes strenuous conditions, es
pecially since, as Mrs. Maslowski
said, her husband never hesitated
to "risk his wife."
Favorite Spots
The Maslowskis' favorite spots i
were not always the most publi
cized. They preferred fishing in the j
less-frequented spots and filming
the less-noticed waterfalls, although
the famed attractions of Yellow- j
stone were not ignored.—Pinkerton j

Wild flowers photographed near
the snow line on Yellowstone's
mountains included the exquisite
pink Bitter Root.
Shy ground-squirrels and not-so
shy coyotes were filmed under
sometimes strenuous conditions, es
pecially since, as Mrs. Maslowski
said, her husband never hesitated
to "risk his wife."
Favorite Spots
The Maslowskis' favorite spots i
were not always the most publi
cized. They preferred fishing in the j
less-frequented spots and filming
the less-noticed waterfalls, although
the famed attractions of Yellow- j
stone were not ignored.—Pinkerton j
Two beavers, "Bertha" and her
husband, stole the show last night
at the Tuesday Evening Scries from
the geysers, spectacular waterfalls,
and even the baby deer which
abound in Yellowstone National
Park as shown in the film "Our Her
itage in the Rockies."
Mrs. 2dna Maslowski's lecture,
accompanying the colored films
taken by her and her husband Karl,
was a rapidly moving commentary
on their often humorous, always
entertaining, experiences in the
Park.
Beaver Dam
Climbing to the top of Mt. Sep
ulchre the couple found a mountain
river da,"mined by the work of bea
vers. They were fortunate, the lec
turer said, to find the creatures at
work during the day when they
could be filmed.
"Bertha" was not beautiful, being
shaggy and pig-eyed, Mrs. Mas
lowski said; but she could gnaw
a branch through in record time.
While she heaved mud from the
bottom of the pool to strengthen the
dam and hauled branches, her in
dolent. husband munched leaves.
Geysers Gurgle
Among the natural phenomena
which immediately marked the
northern Wyoming area as suitable
for the first national p;irk in the
country, when discovered by ex
plorers, were the geysers and other
"thermal attractions" such as pools |
of bubbling mud. Fascinating to I
adults as well as children are "Old j
Faithful's" regular eruptions and j
the more unpredictable gurglings j
and ploppings of the viscous pools.
Taken from strategic angles, the
couple's pictures of the big horn
sheep, the elk, the antelope and
their bewildered offspring moved
the audience with admiration and
amusement.
