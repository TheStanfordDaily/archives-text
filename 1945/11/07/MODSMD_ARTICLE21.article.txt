"The Dynamics of Calcium and |
Phosphorus Metabolism" will be the j
subject of David M. Greenberg, Pro
fessor of Biochemistry at the Cali
fornia Medical School, at the Bio
logical Science department's week
ly seminar this afternoon at 4:15
p.m. in room 430 of Jordan Hall.
Professor Greenberg has done a
great deal of work on proteolytic
enzymes and on the calcium and
magnesium in the blood.
The subject of calcium and phos
phorus metabolism includes the
study of diets involved in produc
ing and curing rickets. The Uni
versity of California has produced
artificial radioactive materials by
means of the cyclotron, and their
deposition in bones has been ex
amined.
The seminar will be precededfby a
tea at 4 p.m. Faculty, students, and
visitors are invited to attend.
