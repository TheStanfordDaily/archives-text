# Washington Men Catch Local Robber
## 
### 
A tall man in a sport coat suspccted of robbing men's living groups
was captured yesterday afternoon by two vigilant and quick-witted
Washington Hall men after they had trailed him to Harrison Hall.
"I first suspected him when he came into my room," reported Rob
ert Gallaghar. Gallaghar had a burglar alarm rigged up in his room

attached to a wallet on his desk,
but the suspect overlooked it.
"He said he was hunting for a
certain man on campus," Galla
ghar explained. "We later found
out there never has been anybody
of that name here at Stanford."
After watching the man at Wash
ington, Robert followed him to Har
rison Hall. He called Bill Lippin
cott, who watched the door at Har
rison while Gallaghar ran upstairs
to find the stranger.
A moment later Gallaghar shouted
"Come on up, Bill. We've got him!"
Bill, five feet four inches, grabbed
a coke bottle and hurried up, while
Gallaghar phoned Stanford police.
Sergeant Edward Fannin took
the man into custody. The 2(5
year-old suspect, whose name is
being withheld pending further
investigation, is from the East and
has no connection with Stanford.
He is being held in the Palo Alto
city jail.
Police believe that six dollars
found under the man's handker
chief in his sport coat pocket may
be the money reported stolen
yesterday from Jerry Matin at
Harrison Hall.
Tyler, Washington and Tamarack
Halls have reported robberies al
ready this quarter. Tyler has lost
over $200 in three robberies within
the last two months. Police are
trying to discover whether the sus
pect is responsible for previous cam
pus thefts.
Dean of Students John Stalnakcr
and Dean of Men's Residences Stan
ley Sharp plan to meet this after
noon with resident assistants and
men's hall presidents to discuss the
closer supervision of guests.
Meanwhile, the Stanford police
department has issued a warning
to all students living on campus
to report any suspicious actions
or persons they observe near liv
ing groups. Chief Gordon Davis
