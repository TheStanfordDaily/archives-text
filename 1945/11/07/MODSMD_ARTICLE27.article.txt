"... And Stanford for its men!"— That's the

news, block "S" sweaters appearing again on
Quad but, strangely enough, in a little shack
on 11.i, north side of campus, people working
hard on the 1946 Quad are finding it difficult
io belive that men's halls really are operating,
or that the majority of men on campus are
taking any interest at all in student affairs.
The facts are that the Quad staff has writ
ten to all men's halls asking each to take a
page with individual pictures of all hall resi
dents for the '46 edition of the yearbook. So
far not half of the halls have even taken the
trouble to answer the letters!
Though general disinterest in all campus af
fairs cannot be presumed through one inci
dent, the fact remains that men's halls are dis
organized and so far there has been no indica
tion the t any type of inter-hall council has been
functioning effectively. With peacetime all

sumption of prewar activities; all are intent at
prese nt on building for an even bigger future,
but to do so they need the support as before
the war of every student group.
