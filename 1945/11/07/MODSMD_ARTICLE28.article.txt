V/iih five days gone on the Eighth War Loan
Drive, the Stanford student body is sadly lack
ing in its obligations. To date the current drive
has not fulfilled its expected goal and indica
tions show that our guota will not be reached.
True, the war has been won, but there are cer
tain responsibilities which are relevant to us
all.
First of all, and most important, is the fact
that the men overseas must be brought home.
Secondly, enormous war debts have yet to be
paid off. Both of these elements are paramount
in importance. We are responsible for the cul
mination of these aims.
The future is remote to most of us. But the
present is now. The Eighth War Loan Drive is
now.
Often times we have been accused of living
5n an Ivory Tower. But don't let us be accused
of shirking our duty.
Friday is the termination of the present war
loan drive. We hit the top guota assigned dur
ing the three and a half years of war. The re
sponsibility of reorganization is upon us now.
Friday is the day. Fifty thousand dollars is
the goal. The price of peace may be more
costly than the price of war. Give now and
give generously. This is the pay-off.
For you who do not arise at 6 a.m.: The great
est sight of all time occurred on Lower Row
Monday morning at the above time. A good
portion of the members of Russell House were
seen groping their way in a sleepy stupor to
the parked cars in front of the house. It seems
the sophomores of the house pulled the well
known sneak, but were not content with this
alone. They had to arrange more consterna
tion by sticking the horn mechanism on every
car in the vicinity of the Russell House. Really,
I don't mind seeing young ladies in pajamas,
but I don't have a class until 9 o'clock!
Don't go slumming Saturday night. Go to
the Chalet Cubberley oh-so-formal dance. The
Quad always remains the same; you can count
on the Cellar serving week-old coffee; and the
local pubs may run out of beer, but never have
you seen the likes of a Chalet-Cubberley party

time. I know, I went minus 36 that quarter.
See ya there.
