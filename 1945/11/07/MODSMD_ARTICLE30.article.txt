To The Associated Students:
In the new Stanford song hook, the pub
lishers have made a few mistakes in the words
of the Stanford Hymn. We regret the errors,
but as no proof of the song book was submitted
to Music Council before publication, we were
unable to correct them.
Since we want to be sure that all Stanford
students know the original words of "Hail
Stanford, Hail!" we are printing the follow
ing, a corrected version of the Stanford Hymn:
HAIL! STANFORD, HAIL!
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Chorus:
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail! Stanford, Hail!
Hail! Stanford, Hail!
Tender vistas ever new
Through the arches meet the eyes,
Where the red roofs rim the blue
Of the sun-steeped skies
Flecked with cloudlets sailing,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
(Chorus)
When the moonlight bathed arcade
Stands in evening cairns,
When the light wind, half afraid,
Whispers in the palms;
Far off swelling failing,
Student voices gladly, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
(Chorus)
Sincerely,
Mary Jane Bull
Music Council
