### Elliot Epsteen 
The labor-management conference has op
ened. President Truman started it oft with a
strong, though meaningless speech, and every
body seems happy.
However, this brings to mind the situation
in 1919, when President Wilson presided over
a similar meeting. It split up over a philos
ophic issue, Collective Bargaining. Now there
is an even more definite cleavage, and philos
ophical in nature.
ISSUES
It revolves around what labor has the right
to bargain for. Previously wages, working con
ditions, and jurisdictional issues were recog
nized. Now labor is adding profits and prices.
Labor has risen far since its early days. It
is now well financed and highly intelligent. It
realizes that wages are not so much of a ques
tion as the correlation between wages and
prices. This means that higher pay will have to
come out of profit.
However management claims that its money
is invested in industry, that it takes all the
risks, and loses the most if things collapse.
Everyone agrees that wages cannot be de
termined unilaterally, but the evil of this system
was clearly demonstrated by the abominable
working conditions of the Nineteenth Century.
But nobody agrees that prices and profits,
the chief incentive for capital to go into busi
ness, should be worked out that way. This must
be the chief issue in the conference, and
might be the one that ruins it.
RESULTS
President Truman holds the balance of power.
But his jurisdiction is not final. Not only can
any group of representatives simply walk out,
but neither management or labor, as a whole,
is bound by what comes out of these talks.
From the general trend of President Tru
man's speeches, it seems that he will support
the labor viewpoint. Thus, if anybody walks
out, it will have to be the capitalists.
The conference, though, might steer its
course through to a final press release if some
thing quite meaningless and too general to be
applied any place is worked out. This is a
definite possibility, because it is good politics.
Thus, in this stage of things, it seems that
although the management-labor conference will
take up a lot of newsprint, the real issues will
probably be settled in the picket lines of the '
nation.
