# Old Adventure Film Shows Lost Sparkle

TIIE PRISONER OF ZEND A—
ends tonight at the Varsity Theatre. |
Your reviewer had no idea how

far the cinema
industry has
tumbled downhill
in the production
of hot-blooded,
swash - buckling
epics until he re
saw "The Prison
er of Zenda." For
here is an ener
getic film that
does a plenty

socko job of recapturing the atmo
sphere as it might have been in a
day long past. Ronald Colman,
Madeline Carroll, Raymond Massey,
and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., head
an expensive, well hosen cast.
It would be useless to attempt to
relate this intricate story of court

intrigue and scandal with its many
ramifications. Instead we'd just like
to say a word about the total effect
which is produced. For never has
there been so much regal
love-making, and sword-play snow
balled into 100 minutes. Even the
! most incurable of "cinecynics"
should realize that he is witnessing
Hollywood in one of its few moments
when all eyes aren't on the pocket
book.
Ronald Colman
Ronnie Colman has perhaps the
best of his "king for a day" roles,
even though he sounds like a
spoony, high school poet in a few
spots. And certainly Madeline Car
roll's beauty will never never be
equaled by your Bacalls or Grables.
But it is Raymond 'Massey and
Doug Fairbanks, Jr., who really
have the proverbial busmen's holi
day. The former is as mercenary
and as ruthless an actor as we've
ever seen while the young Fair
banks has that manner blithe and
debonair that so manj' of the war
time hams were trying to copy.
If you don't enjoy "The Prisoner
of Zenda," you undoubtedly have a
great big hole right in the middle
of your head. You know, the part
that belongs to David O. Selznick.
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"
The companion feature is a re
showing of "The Adventures of Tom
| Sawyer." There's a whole slug of
juveniie delinquents around and all
in all it's a rather trying exper
j ience. But then I suppose it is
j rather hard to recapture the halcyon
! days of one's youth.—Dick Bower.
