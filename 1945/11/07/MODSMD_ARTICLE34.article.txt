In view of the confusion, in (he
minds of many people, caused by
the recent Labor party victory in
the Hritish Isles, Mr. ISraml has
chosen to discuss "British Labor
and Russia."
i"I will describe the degree of dif
| ference and the degree of likeness
I of the British Labor party and the
U.5.5.R.," said Mr. Brand. "The
British Labor policy toward Russia
has embodied three principles:
fighting the policy of British Con
servatives toward Russia, endeavor
ing to bring Russia into the fam
ily of nations, and opposing the
spead of the Communist Interna
tional organization. Although the
Labor party has supported Russia
I abroad, it has consistently opposed

the Communist party within Britain.
There is no connection between the
British Labor party and Commu
nism; they are as unlike as democ
racy and dictatorship."
Mr. Rrand is author of "British
Labour's Rise to Power," pub
lished by the Stanford Press in
