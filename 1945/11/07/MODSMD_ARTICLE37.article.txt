# Dutch Queen Savors Indonesian Equality
## 
### NONA THOMAS 
"Conditions in Holland during
the war have brought about a nat
ural sympathy among the people
ol the Netherlands for the Indo
nesians," said Mr. O. CI. Sanders, j
director of the Netherlands In
formation Bureau in San Francis- j
co, 'and in fact Che underground
in Holland and the government in
exile jointly published during the
war a manifesto, in which they ad
vocated complete self government
in its domestic affairs for each of
the colonies, and a partnership
for all in the common affairs,
the foreign policy, and the defense
of the empire."
He ascribed the sympathy of the
Dutch for the Indonesians' cause to
the fact that both countries had j
been occupied, and both pooples j
persecuted by the enemy during the ,
war, and quoted the underground's
nanifesto:
Dutch Queen's Promise
"Indonesia, Suriname, and Cura
cao are entitled to complete fulfill
ment of the promise made by Her
Majesty the Queen, in her royal
declaration of December 7, 1942, that
they, in a manner to be determined
at a round table conference, shall
be acknowledged equivalent parts
of the Kingdom and freedom from
internal matters, with equal rights
in foreign affairs."
Mr. Sanders said that he regards
it as unfortunate that both the
Netherlands and Indonesia have J
| been "hermetically sealed in at
I opposite ends of the world through
j occupation by the enemy. For,"
he said, "Indonesians are not by t
nature violent people, and much of
the feeling in the present rebel- |
lion is ascrihahle to Japanese
propaganda, the effect of which
most people have seriously under
estimated. in their educational
campaign the slogan, 'Asia for the !
Asiatics,' has had tremendous im- j
pact."
As a result of this propoganda
campaign, he says an antagonism
has arisen in Indonesia "not only
against the Dutch but against all
western peoples, and Indo-Euro
peans as well."
Soerkano Lacks Strength
He feels that Soerkano, who has
been endeavoring to prevent vio- I
lence, cannot indefinitely maintain
order; and says that a number of
"innocent bystanders have already
been killed in the campaign of ter
rorism which has been instituted."
Should feeling run much higher,
he fears that the Europeans who
were placed in concentration camps
in New Guinea by the Japanese also
may be killed.
In speaking of the Nationalist j
movement Mr. Sanders stated that
it "comprised not more than one ;
per cent of the population of In
donesia prior to the war." and
again, ascribed its growth in pop
ularity in part to the Japanese
, propaganda that "failure of the
Japanese would mean failure of
other eastern Asiatics as well."
He pointed out that the "Indo
nesian Republic" had been "pro
claimed free and independent by
the Japanese from Singapore almost
a week after they were defeated,"
and he l'eels Soerkano, who he
says was appointed president by the
Japanese, is "most questionable."
Soerkan's Sympathies?
Soerkano has, according to Mr.
Sanders, said much against all of
the allies, has visited Japan during
the war, and has been on the Jap
anese Advisory Council in Indonesia
during the war. He added, however,
"I do not know certainly that he
was a collaborationist, and his case
should be fairly presented. If he
worked with the Japanese to help
his own people, that is one thing,
but if he was simply a stooge for
them, that is a horse of a different
color."
He also said that there was no
question that some of the members
of the "Indonesian Republic" had
been strongly anti-Japanese
throughout the war. but expressed
the opinion that their willingness
to cooperate with "more question
able" members of the cabinet was
due to their sharing a desire for
independence.
Mr. Sanders expressed the opin
ion that the divergences of opin
ion among members of the cabi
| net, not only on the question of
collaboration during the war, but
also on religious and political
principles, might well cause a split

in the government should an inde
pendent Indonesian state be
formed.
Continuing on the question of |
collaboration, Mr. Sanders stated
that the rumor that Soerkano and i
other Indonesians were collabora- j
tionists shocks the people at home i
in the Netherlands, where, due to j
the recent occupation by the Ger- '
mans, feeling against collaboration- J
ists is extremely high.
Emotional Complication
"Thus, though a real desire to
help Indonesia had grown up in J
Holland during the war," he added,
"the rebellion has created a highly |
emotional situation there as well as j
in Indonesia, making the solution of
the problem doubly difficult."
Mr. Sanders made direct re
sponse to a number of the charges
that have been made against the
Dutch administration in Indonesia.
"It is," lie said, "easy to sell an
abstract idea like political freedom
to a large untrained population;
hut the administration of an island
like Java where 50 million people
inhabit a very small area, requires
capability, training, and experi
ence.
Their economic problems are, in
reality, much more important than
independence, for without proper
administration, the island could be
swept by famines of unsurpassed se
verity.
People Untrained
"And,"he continued, "though the
islands have progressed education
ally, all their leaders have been
trained in either Dutch universities
in Indonesia, or at universities in
the Netherlands; and the large mass
of the population has not been
trained at all."
In answer to the question of why
there has not been more freedom
of education in Indonesia, Mr.
Sanders said, "We have been hesi
tant of forcing western education
down the throats of a people who
have a superior culture of their
own. We have not wished to take
from them their own culture, to
give them in return only the ve
neer of western civilization, and
make of them orientals in western
overcoats."
"Moreover," he continued, "The
J Netherlands has never used force
in Indonesia, in fact, coercion would
have been impossible, for the Dutch
have had only 30,000 men there as
a standing army. Thus we could
not force education upon the native
population; and it must be remem
bered that 80 per cent of the popula
tion is Islamic.
"Islam, with all its grandeur, does
not subscribe to education, particu
larly for women, and once, in an
attempt to force education upon
them, the administration started an
j incipient revolution."
Indonesians Respected
In conclusion Mr. Sanders said,
J "Hollanders respect the Indonesians.
! We have benefitted by having many
j of their brilliant men, not only in
j the government of Indonesia, but in
the administration at home as well.

One Indonesian in the Netherlands
first became mayor of Amsterdam
and later was appointed to the Privy
Council of the Queen. Others have
held cabinet posts.
"And the average person in the
Netherlands is sympathetic to the
Indonesian cause. In their mani
festo the underground requested
that no force be used against In
donesians in rebellion if possible.
Thus there is the opportunity, if
the Queen's plan can be worked
out. for the Netherlands and Indo
nesia together to do a very line
thingâ€”to bring together in har
mony and freedom the western
and oriental points of view."
