# Army Team Challenges
## 
### DICK BATTELLE 
On the night of November 1, a
basketball game was played in the
men's gym before an audience of
about 20 curious persons. Although
unpublicized, the game was of con
siderable significance. It was the
trial run for the AST Army All-
Stars. Only half of the chosen squad
was present, but the results were
conclusive enough for Coach Ever
ett Dean to add another wrinkle to
his furrowed brow.
O'pposing the All-Stars was an
E.R.C. team that clicked with hon
ey-like perfection. The game was
so close that an overtime period had
to be played to decide the game.
The overtime period resulted in a
29-2G victory for the All-Stars.
Both teams were new to the
change from cross-court to full
court tactics, and the All-Stars were
playing together for the first time.
Further practice will make a deci
sive difference.
A CHALLENGE: If military au
thorities and Coach Dean are agree
able, the All-Stars would enjoy the
opportunity of testing the temper
of the Indian varsity.
