### AL SCIARONI 
The last of the Bay Area univer
sities came back into the football
picture for next season when the
University of Santa Clara signed
Laurence A. (Mon) Mullins to coach
the Bronco squad next fall.
Santa Clara had announced that
they would probably play ball next
year, and the signing of Mullins
made fotball for the Broncos a .sure
thing.
Wide Coaching Experience
Mullins has had a lot of coach
ing experience. After his gradua
tion from Notre Dame in 1931, he
was head coach at St. Benedict's
College, Kansas, from 1932 to 193G.
For the next three years he was head
man at Loyal University of New
Orleans, and in 1940 was head coach
at Ambrose College, lowa. In 1941
he coached the backs at the Univer
sity of Florida, and in 1943 assisted
Don Faurat with the strong lowa
Seahawks.
11 u It ins Teammate of Schwartz
Mullins will arrive at Santa Clara
next month, and has been given a
free hand in selecting aides. It is
expected that he will offor the post
of assistant coach to Lin Casanova,
who was assistant to Buck Shaw at
Santa Clara in prewar days.
Mullins was a teammate of March
ie Schwartz, Stanford head football
coach, and this should make the

Indian-Bronco rivalry hotter than
ever when the two teams clash on
the gridiron once again. Another
coincidence is that all Bay Area
coaches are Notre Dame graduates.
Besides Schwartz and Mullins there
are Jimmy Phelan of St. Mary's,
Buck Shaw of California, and Clip
per Smith of the University of San
Francisco. There should really be
some rivalry in the Bay Area next
year.
St. Mary's Fifth
They said I was crazy last week
when I picked St. Mary's by 14
points, and maybe I was at that
time, but the Gaels really came
through last Saturday when they de
feated El Trajon 26-0. They did far
better than the most rabid support
ers of Wedemcyer and Co. ever
hoped they coud do in their most
wild dreams.
Because of their overwhelming
victory last week, St. Mary's is rated
fifth this week in the national foot
ball standings. Ahead of the Gaels
are Army, Notre Dame, Navy, and
Alabama.
Gaels Have Breather
This week the Gaels have a
breather game when they play Fres
no State at Fresno. The following
week they come up against the
Bruins of UCLA. This game will
probably play to a full house at the
Coliseum.
