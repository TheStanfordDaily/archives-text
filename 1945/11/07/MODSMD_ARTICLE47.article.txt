MOSCOW. Idaho. Nov. 6 (UP â€”
j Babe Brown, coach of the Univer
, sity of Idaho, said today an ankle
injury suffered by Fullback Dick
Johnson would probably necessitate
reorganization of the Vandal back
i field for the Farragut Naval Train
i ing Station game Saturday.
Phil Ljtzenberger would likely
I start at fullback and Ben Steelhead,
| a former end, would open the con
! test at the quarterback position,
I Brown said. Warren Shepherd, who
played a good game against Oregon
State, would be in the left half
spot, and Jim Hatch would be
berthed in the right half, Brown said.
