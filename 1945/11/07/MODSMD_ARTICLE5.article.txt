"Geopolitics" will be the topic of
discussion when C. Langdon White,
professor of geography at Stanford
University, speaks before members
of International Club, tonight at

Women's Clubhouse.
Mr. White will stress the im

tional problems of transportation,
trade, and economic relations be
tween nations.
Tonight's meeting will be the first

Previously, the members have met

more students will be interested in
attending to meet students not only
from the United States but also
from foreign countries," President
Robie Robinson stated.
Following Mr. White's talk, stu
dents will have the opportunity to
ask questions and hold an informal
discussion. Refreshments will be
