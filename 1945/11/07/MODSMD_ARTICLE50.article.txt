# Dean Notes Improvement
## 
### STU MILLAR 
The stress was still on fundamen- !
tals as another week of basketball
practice got under way yesterday
afternoon in the Pavilion. Coach
Everett Dean and Forest Anderson,
who is unofficial assistant, again put
the civilian and Navy aspirants for
varsity berths through another stiff
workout that ended in a fast scrim
mage. I
After a half hour of individual
basket-shooting, the t?am went to
work on the basic fakes and feints
which are so important in the Dean
system. This art of fooling the oppo
sition with finesse will probably
constitute the backbone of the Card
offense this year, for. as sideline ob
servers have noticed, Coach Dean
does not have too much height with
which to work.
Dean Depends on Speedsters
He must necessarily depsnd on a
tricky, fast man, rather than the tall
one that usually rates top spot on a
good quintet. It might be noted that
other teams on the Pacific Coast
will field towering teams this sea
son. UCLA has 23 men over 6 feet
out for varsity, and USC has many
like Jack Nichols, its giant pivot
man.
And when Cal turns out anything
but a tall team it means there just
aren't any six-footers on the Bdar
campus at all.
Work on Fast Break, Defense
The Card mentor put his men
through a drill on the fast break
and Anderson led the men in in
dividual defense practice before the
scrimmage.
Dean also took some time to give
individual instruction to his centers
on ball handling and correct feeding
of the ball on set-ups.
Outlook Grows Brighter
"The boys need a lot of scrim
maging," said Coach Dean after
practice, "and they are going to get
it. The team has been improving as
a whole, but it can still go much
further."
The quintet that looked best in
actual scrimmage was composed of
Wallas, Hill, O'Brien, Christiansen
and Streisser. Other units were To
ney, Pascoe, Meredith, Rader, and
Stuart; Hood. Fox, King, Taylor,
and Slobe; Westmoreland, Rosberg,
Thaxton, Erlich, and Lamb, and
Rosehill, Hoffman, Dole, Magee and
West.
