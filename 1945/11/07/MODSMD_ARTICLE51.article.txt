# Tentative First Team Picked
## Burkes, Ashley, Lipelt, Willey Look Good in Cardinal Backfield 
### 
Another busy day was spent on the football field yesterday afternoon.
Marchie Schwartz ran various backfield combinations through passing
piays mostly. Linemen worked with Fred Serihner in improving their
blocking and their general line duties. Main complaint from Marchie
Schwartz is that he doesn't have enough time for daily workouts. Ordi
narily practice is held for at least two hours, but this season daily stints
have been held to an hour.
TENTATIVE BACKFIELD
A tentative backfield is Curt Burkes at quarterback, Tom Ashley
and Don Lipelt at the halfback posts, and Fred Willey plunging from
fullback. Burkes' passing has caught everybody's eye, and if he speeds
lip a little in his ball-handling, he will develop into a first-class quar
terback. Closely following on his heels, at the moment, is Bill Larson,
who is a fairly shifty ball handler, but whose passing needs considerable
improvement. Lipelt and Ashley are both hard runners, and pretty fair

pass snaggers. Fred Willey, who ♦
according to Schwartz is one of 1
the most improved players on the
field, continues to lead the race
for the fullback slot. Another
nifty line plunger is Nissen, who !
already has shown his worth on
dc-ncse. A little smaller than
Willey, but more "maneuverable," j
this boy will see a lot of football.
Line positions are wide open still, j
but a few of the men in the mole- j
skin who have looked a little bt't- i
ter than the average are Joe Babich j
and Del Torkelson at the flanker
spots. Both boys have had previous
colege experience, a rarity on the !
present Stanford varsity; Babich at
St. Mary's, and Torkelson at Kan
sas State. Other ends showing up
well have been Harry Borcher, Dave
DeSwarte, and Ric Supple, who
punts the pigskin for distance, also.
Guard and Tackle Open
The guard and tackle positions
are as open as the doors will be at
the Chalet shindig this Saturday.
No one has particularly impressed
the coaches as yet. The center slot
is being nailed down by Bob
Abrams, whose brother is fullback
at Washington State this year un
der Phil Sarboe.
Stanford's game on Dec. 1 with
the San Mateo Merchant Marine
Academy will sort of be a miniature
"big game." All the cadets are go
ing to turn out for the grid titanic,
including their band. And the col
ors of the school are Blue and Gold.
In four games this season their grid
machine has run up 100 points, and
only seven points have been charged ;
against them. The club uses the T i
and the single wing offensively, and
their average weight is 183 pounds. I
