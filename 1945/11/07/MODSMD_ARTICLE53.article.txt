# Semi-Finalists To Clash Today
## 
### 
If weather permits, Connie Whee
ler and Tom Scofield will play their
semi-final match with Barbara
Beardslee and Grover Miller this
afternoon.
As the all-campus mixed doubles
tennis tournament enters its last
stages, the winner of today's match
will play George Leong and Tappy
Kimball in the finals.
Leong and Kimball entered the
finals by defeating Marianne Supple
and Joe Owen last week-end.
All of the seeded teams in the
five-week tournament have been
eliminated, which assures a sur
prise winner in the finals.
