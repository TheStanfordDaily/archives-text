WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 (UP).â€”
Navy demobilization has passed the
half-million mark, it was revealed

military policy flared anew in the
Senate with demands for suspension
of the draft and for a civilian inves

tem.
A spokesman said that through
Monday, 505,000 Navy personnel had
been discharged. The total included
441,000 male enlisted personnel,
47,900 male officers and 10,500

for the release of some 1,200,000
personnel by Jan. 1.
