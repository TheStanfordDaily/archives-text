# Leighton Awarded Medal For Bomb Experiments
## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
A desert waste-land 100 miles
from Salt Lake City, Utah, was the
scene of secret scientific research
where Dr. Philip Albert Leighton,
professor of chemistry, then a lieu
tenant colonel in the army, conduct
ed experiments which led to his
being awarded the Legion of Merit
• recently.
Professor Leighton was connected
with the army's chemical warfare
department and his award read "for
supervising the entire war gas,
smoke, and incendiary bomb re
search and development program as
director of technical operations,
Dugway Proving Ground, Tooele,
Utah, from March 1943 to May,
1945."
"Axis Village" Site
In connection with the incendiary
bomb research—the headquarters of
which were called "Axis Village"—
Professor Leighton explained that
the army built German and Jap
anese villages, complete to the last
details, to test the bombs. From
Honolulu the right type floor mats

were flown to reconstruct the Jap
village correctly. "We had to make
sure the wood had the same mois
ture content as it would under cli
matic conditions in the country,"
he said.
Lace curtains were even hung at
the windows in the German village,
while the furniture was also made to
order. In these German houses
heavy furniture with feather mat
tresses on the beds were added,
while the German architectural
feature of joining heavy timbers
with dovetail joints instead of nails
and bolls was carried out. Between
the ceiling of the first story and the
floor of the story above, cinders
were put in for insulation, accord
ing to the German practice.
Sliding Screens
In the Japanese houses, adobe was
used instead of plaster and sliding
sereens instead of windows.
These two villages, which cost ap
proximately three quarters of a mil
lion dollars to construct the first
time, covered the equivalent of a
block, Professor Leighton explained,
and they included all types of
houses, constructed from available
information by architects who had
lived in these two countries. The
villages were rebuilt three or four
times after they had been bombed.
Jellied Gas Used
Results of the bombs showed that
"napalm" or jellied gas, was the
most efTective against the Japs and
small magnesium incendiaries
against the Germans.
The process used in development
of the jellied gasoline, Professor
Leighton likened to the process of
making gelatin, that is, an undis
closed material is added to jell the
gasoline.
Secret War Gas
Napalm, on the development of
which Professor Leighton worked,
made up the incendiary bombs
which the B-29's dropped on the Jap
anese mainland and in flame thx-ow
ers used in ground fighting.
The war gas which he developed
was never used and is therefore on
the list of military secrets.
Farm 'Wonderful'
Professor Leighton left Stanford
in September, 1943 to go to Utah.
The whole project was so secret that
at first he was not able to tell his
family where he was. Toward the
end of the project, however, officer's
wives were allowed to live at the
post.
"I went there as a civilian, and
first thing I knew I was in the
army," he laughed. Stanford looked
"wonderful" to the returning pro
fessor, who says he hopes he never
has to leave again.
Self-Sufficient Community
Further describing the proving
ground, Professor Leighton said that
since it was so far from any cities
that it had to be self-sufficient.
There was a complete community,
although it wasn't very beautiful.
The only shrubbery was the scrub
growing on the desert waste-land,
and the soil itself was of a clay
like consistency.
The personnel of the community
was made up of about 1,000 enlisted
men, a small number of civilian
scientists, and some WACs, selected
for their scientific training. The
WACs found work in chemical,
photography and meterological lab
oratories, as well as in being truck
drivers.
Has Airport
The community had its own air

landing strip as well as several
B-17 and B-25 bombers to carry out
the bombing experiments.
"We had the most expert fire
fighters in the army when we got
through with our practice bombings,"
Professor Leighton smiled.
In the chemist's office in the
chemistry building is a unique ash
tray stand, about three and a half
feet in height, made from the cas
ing of a smoke bomb whose con
tents Professor Leighton helped to
make. The bombs, containing a
chemical which make smoke when
they explode, were used by our
troops to cover the landings and
invasions.
Smoke Screens
"At the beginning of the war not
much was known about the effect
of wind and air currents on smoke
screens," he said. "We studied the
problem and were able to make cer
tain recommendations used as ear
ly as the North African campaign."
The smoke was either dropped from
planes in bombs or the smoke was
sprayed from the planes, the former
being the more satisfactory.
"We would have been very apt
to use this theory on the Japanese
coast if we had invaded there," he
commented.
Gets Citation
The citation which accompanies
his Legion of Merit says: "With
great creative genius, foresight, and
scientific ability, he conducted num
erous technical and tactical field
tests of air and ground chemical
warfare munitions which resulted in
important changes of concept in the
use of chemical and incendiary
weapons .... through his initia
tive and perseverence he made last
ing and important contributions to
American military sciences."

A desert waste-land 100 miles
from Salt Lake City, Utah, was the
scene of secret scientific research
where Dr. Philip Albert Leighton,
professor of chemistry, then a lieu
tenant colonel in the army, conduct
ed experiments which led to his
being awarded the Legion of Merit
• recently.
Professor Leighton was connected
with the army's chemical warfare
department and his award read "for
supervising the entire war gas,
smoke, and incendiary bomb re
search and development program as
director of technical operations,
Dugway Proving Ground, Tooele,
Utah, from March 1943 to May,
1945."
"Axis Village" Site
In connection with the incendiary
bomb research—the headquarters of
which were called "Axis Village"—
Professor Leighton explained that
the army built German and Jap
anese villages, complete to the last
details, to test the bombs. From
Honolulu the right type floor mats

were flown to reconstruct the Jap
village correctly. "We had to make
sure the wood had the same mois
ture content as it would under cli
matic conditions in the country,"
he said.
Lace curtains were even hung at
the windows in the German village,
while the furniture was also made to
order. In these German houses
heavy furniture with feather mat
tresses on the beds were added,
while the German architectural
feature of joining heavy timbers
with dovetail joints instead of nails
and bolls was carried out. Between
the ceiling of the first story and the
floor of the story above, cinders
were put in for insulation, accord
ing to the German practice.
Sliding Screens
In the Japanese houses, adobe was
used instead of plaster and sliding
sereens instead of windows.
These two villages, which cost ap
proximately three quarters of a mil
lion dollars to construct the first
time, covered the equivalent of a
block, Professor Leighton explained,
and they included all types of
houses, constructed from available
information by architects who had
lived in these two countries. The
villages were rebuilt three or four
times after they had been bombed.
Jellied Gas Used
Results of the bombs showed that
"napalm" or jellied gas, was the
most efTective against the Japs and
small magnesium incendiaries
against the Germans.
The process used in development
of the jellied gasoline, Professor
Leighton likened to the process of
making gelatin, that is, an undis
closed material is added to jell the
gasoline.
Secret War Gas
Napalm, on the development of
which Professor Leighton worked,
made up the incendiary bombs
which the B-29's dropped on the Jap
anese mainland and in flame thx-ow
ers used in ground fighting.
The war gas which he developed
was never used and is therefore on
the list of military secrets.
Farm 'Wonderful'
Professor Leighton left Stanford
in September, 1943 to go to Utah.
The whole project was so secret that
at first he was not able to tell his
family where he was. Toward the
end of the project, however, officer's
wives were allowed to live at the
post.
"I went there as a civilian, and
first thing I knew I was in the
army," he laughed. Stanford looked
"wonderful" to the returning pro
fessor, who says he hopes he never
has to leave again.
Self-Sufficient Community
Further describing the proving
ground, Professor Leighton said that
since it was so far from any cities
that it had to be self-sufficient.
There was a complete community,
although it wasn't very beautiful.
The only shrubbery was the scrub
growing on the desert waste-land,
and the soil itself was of a clay
like consistency.
The personnel of the community
was made up of about 1,000 enlisted
men, a small number of civilian
scientists, and some WACs, selected
for their scientific training. The
WACs found work in chemical,
photography and meterological lab
oratories, as well as in being truck
drivers.

anese mainland and in flame thx-ow

The war gas which he developed
was never used and is therefore on
the list of military secrets.
Farm 'Wonderful'
Professor Leighton left Stanford
in September, 1943 to go to Utah.
The whole project was so secret that
at first he was not able to tell his
family where he was. Toward the
end of the project, however, officer's
wives were allowed to live at the
post.
"I went there as a civilian, and
first thing I knew I was in the
army," he laughed. Stanford looked
"wonderful" to the returning pro
fessor, who says he hopes he never
has to leave again.
Self-Sufficient Community
Further describing the proving
ground, Professor Leighton said that
since it was so far from any cities
that it had to be self-sufficient.
There was a complete community,
although it wasn't very beautiful.
The only shrubbery was the scrub
growing on the desert waste-land,
and the soil itself was of a clay
like consistency.
The personnel of the community
was made up of about 1,000 enlisted
men, a small number of civilian
scientists, and some WACs, selected
for their scientific training. The
WACs found work in chemical,
photography and meterological lab
oratories, as well as in being truck
drivers.
Has Airport
The community had its own air

landing strip as well as several
B-17 and B-25 bombers to carry out
the bombing experiments.
"We had the most expert fire
fighters in the army when we got
through with our practice bombings,"
Professor Leighton smiled.
In the chemist's office in the
chemistry building is a unique ash
tray stand, about three and a half
feet in height, made from the cas
ing of a smoke bomb whose con
tents Professor Leighton helped to
make. The bombs, containing a
chemical which make smoke when
they explode, were used by our
troops to cover the landings and
invasions.
Smoke Screens
"At the beginning of the war not
much was known about the effect
of wind and air currents on smoke
screens," he said. "We studied the
problem and were able to make cer
tain recommendations used as ear
ly as the North African campaign."
The smoke was either dropped from
planes in bombs or the smoke was
sprayed from the planes, the former
being the more satisfactory.
"We would have been very apt
to use this theory on the Japanese
coast if we had invaded there," he
commented.

The citation which accompanies
his Legion of Merit says: "With
great creative genius, foresight, and
scientific ability, he conducted num
erous technical and tactical field
tests of air and ground chemical
warfare munitions which resulted in
important changes of concept in the
use of chemical and incendiary
weapons .... through his initia
tive and perseverence he made last
ing and important contributions to
American military sciences."
A desert waste-land 100 miles
from Salt Lake City, Utah, was the
scene of secret scientific research
where Dr. Philip Albert Leighton,
professor of chemistry, then a lieu
tenant colonel in the army, conduct
ed experiments which led to his
being awarded the Legion of Merit
• recently.
Professor Leighton was connected
with the army's chemical warfare
department and his award read "for
supervising the entire war gas,
smoke, and incendiary bomb re
search and development program as
director of technical operations,
Dugway Proving Ground, Tooele,
Utah, from March 1943 to May,
1945."
"Axis Village" Site
In connection with the incendiary
bomb research—the headquarters of
which were called "Axis Village"—
Professor Leighton explained that
the army built German and Jap
anese villages, complete to the last
details, to test the bombs. From
Honolulu the right type floor mats

were flown to reconstruct the Jap
village correctly. "We had to make
sure the wood had the same mois
ture content as it would under cli
matic conditions in the country,"
he said.
Lace curtains were even hung at
the windows in the German village,
while the furniture was also made to
order. In these German houses
heavy furniture with feather mat
tresses on the beds were added,
while the German architectural
feature of joining heavy timbers
with dovetail joints instead of nails
and bolls was carried out. Between
the ceiling of the first story and the
floor of the story above, cinders
were put in for insulation, accord
ing to the German practice.
Sliding Screens
In the Japanese houses, adobe was
used instead of plaster and sliding
sereens instead of windows.
These two villages, which cost ap
proximately three quarters of a mil
lion dollars to construct the first
time, covered the equivalent of a
block, Professor Leighton explained,
and they included all types of
houses, constructed from available
information by architects who had
lived in these two countries. The
villages were rebuilt three or four
times after they had been bombed.
Jellied Gas Used
Results of the bombs showed that
"napalm" or jellied gas, was the
most efTective against the Japs and
small magnesium incendiaries
against the Germans.
The process used in development
of the jellied gasoline, Professor
Leighton likened to the process of
making gelatin, that is, an undis
closed material is added to jell the
gasoline.
Secret War Gas
Napalm, on the development of
which Professor Leighton worked,
made up the incendiary bombs
which the B-29's dropped on the Jap
anese mainland and in flame thx-ow
ers used in ground fighting.
