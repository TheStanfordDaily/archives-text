### 
CHUNGKING, Nov. G (UP).—Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer flew from ;
Tokyo to Peiping today for a conference with air and Marine commanders j
that may decide whether 50,000 American Marines are withdrawn from I
China.
Wedemeyer, commander of American forces in China, hud just com
pleted conferences with Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz in Pearl I

Ilarhor and Supreme Allied Com
mander Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur
in Japan.
Tientsin dispatches said Marine
units there were electrified by un
confirmed reports that Marine
forces in North China would be
returned to the United States. ...
Meeting with Wedemeyer in Pei
ping were Lt. Gen. George E.
Stratemeyer, American air com
mander in China; Maj. Gen. Keller
E. Rockey, commander of Marines
in North China; and Rockey's chief
of staff, Brig. Gen. William A. Wort.
The conference was being held
amid a Chinese Communist press
campaign demanding evacuation
of the Marine forces because of
alleged intervention in the unde
clared war between Communist
and Central Government forces.
The alleged Marine intervention
has been denied in Washington
and Chungking.
American sea and air forces in
China, although not actively fight
ing with Nationalist troops against
the Communists, have aided them
by transporting Nationalist armies
from South China to the potential
battleground of North China and
Manchuria.
Tientsin dispatches said a ru
mor was circulating there to the
effect that 19 U.S. Marines have
been killed so far in North China.
Although the deaths were uncon
firmed, it was said to be common
knowledge that eight to 10 Ma
rines have been wounded.
An armored force of about 25
medium Sherman tanks rumbled
through the streets of Tientsin
Tuesday afternoon, apparently in a
show of force designed to impress
the Chinese Communists.

WASHINGTON, Nov. (3 (UP). —United Mine Workers chief John Li.
Lewis scored a victory in the national labor-management conference today
when he won representation on the important executive committee for his
own and another unafiiliated union in a session marked by fiery clashes
between various labor factions.
The committee membership was doubled to 16, with eight of the
places going to management rep- ♦ ■

resentatives and the other eight [
divided among the labor groups—
three each to the Congress of In
dustrial Organizations and the
American Federation of Labor '
and one each to the United Mine ;
Workers and the railroad broth
erhoods. Lewis was named the '
UMW member and T. C. Cashcn
for the brotherhoods.
Originally, the committee was to
have been composed of eight mem
bers, with the four labor spots di
vided equally between the CIO and
AFL. Lewis demanded that labor be
given broader representation and
forced reconsideration by the rules
committee.
Lewis unleashed thunderous or
atory at his one-time friend and
associate, CIO President Philip
Murray, after the latter had in
ferred that Lewis was conducting
a "blitz" to get on the executive
committee. Lewis termed Mur
ray's reference "unique and des
picable German terminology."
Another bitter debate ensued af
ter the rules committee announced
its proposal to double the executive I
committee's membership and Judge
Walter P„ Stacey, conference chair- j
man, was about to appoint its per
sonnel. CIO Secretary James B.
aCrey interrupted Stacey to ask if
a railroad brotherhood member was
to be included.
Carey's inquiry brought Cashen to
his feet. Cashen declared that un
der the circumstances he did not
want to be appointed and told Carey
he didn't think "it proper that a
member of the labor group should
raise such a question."

Communist Eighth Route Army of
