gram, according to Chairman Eugene
Mitguard. Other dates approved by

Women's Conference minutes for

• this week were read. In its meeting

Monday, Confer
ence decided to
appoint women's
nominating com
mittee to nomi
nate women stu
dents to ASSU
offices at election

Since the trial ASSU constitution
j makes no provision for such a com-
I mittee, there was some question as
! to whether the Conference proposal
would conflict with the ASSU consti
tutional provision for petitioning for
nominations. Excom decided, with
! out discussion, that there was no
i conflict, and Conference minutes
| were approved.
There was some discussion of stu«-
dent antics on Hallow'en last week.
| In connection with this ASSU Vico-
I president Charmian Kolar said, "Hal
low'en disturbances have reached the
i point where they aren't funny any
; more. Too many people are getting
I carried away under the name of
i fun." She added that the "rowdi
j ness" exhibited on Hallowe'en this
year was "conduct that is not becom
ing to Stanford men and women."
There was some discussion con
cerning the Nitery, with several Ex

com members reporting dissatisfac
tion among their constituents that
the Nitery was still closed. Miss Cal
fee reported that the Nitery coke
machines are losing money because
l a large number of empty bottles
have evidently been stolen. It was
suggested that this problem be tak
en back to Cardinals for further
discussion as to a solution.
In closing ASSU President Bob
Kennedy reminded Excom that elec
tions are being held next Wednes
day for Freshman Class Officers, one
I member to Men's Council, and one
member to the Board of Athletic
j Control

cerning the Nitery, with several Ex

com members reporting dissatisfac
tion among their constituents that
the Nitery was still closed. Miss Cal
fee reported that the Nitery coke

Women's Conference minutes for

• this week were read. In its meeting

Monday, Confer
ence decided to
appoint women's
nominating com
mittee to nomi

I mittee, there was some question as

i conflict, and Conference minutes

ing to Stanford men and women."
