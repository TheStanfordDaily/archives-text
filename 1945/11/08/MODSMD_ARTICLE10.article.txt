# French Applaud War Government
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 6 (UP) â€”A new con
stituent assembly, first freely-elected
parliament to meet in France in five
years, held its first session in the
historic, war-scarred chamber of
deputies today and accepted the res
ignation of Gen. Charles de Gaulle's
wartime provisional government.
The entire assembly, some 580 del
egates, applauded vigorously when
81-year-old Paul Cuttoli, white
haired dean and temporary presi
dent of the assembly, praised de
Gaulle's past services to France in
his opening address.
When Cuttoli referred to de Gaulle
as the certain head of the next gov
ernment, the majority of the left
wing socialists and Communists sat
silent while the right wing applauded
loudly,
The surrender of provisional gov
ernment power was simple. Cuttoli
read a resignation letter from de
Gaulle saying the task of the gov
ernment was ended and that it would
merely carry on routine current bus
iness until the new president is
elected, probably Friday.
