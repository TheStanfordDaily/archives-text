"The local mer
chants as well

as some of the large San Fran
cisco stores hav.e been wonderful
in their donations for the bond
auction," Janic Sonthcimcr, head
of the auction, said.
The war bond auctions have be
come a tradition around the cam
pus ever since the old Pi Phi wa
gon went up on the auction block
at one of the first auctions held
after the war started.
"Of particular interest to seniors

who plan to bid on articles is the
Alumni Association membership,"
Miss Sonthemicr said. "The value
of the membership is $50 and cer
tainly is something that every
Stanford graduate will want to re
mind them of days on (be Farm."
Master of ceremonies at the bond
auction will be Don Bechter. Pledges
through parents can be made to the
Farm drive but must be brought to
Stanford the night of trio auction.
"We want to stress the fact that
group bidding is allowed," Miss
Sontheimer said. "The groups who
plan to bid like this should look
the articles over carefully and de
cide which ones they want to con
centrate on."
As an unusual feature in the group

bidding Dr. and Mrs. Herbert Jan i
Popper have volunteered their serv- j
i ices as hashers for one night.
During intermission at the bond
rally an original song by Jane
Fra/.ier, "I'll Never Be Alone,"
