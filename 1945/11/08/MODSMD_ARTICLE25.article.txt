## COMMONWEALTH: A PHILIPPINE SURVEY 
### 
Some gratifying news appeared in the col
umns of the daily papers Sunday. President
Truman has ordered the F. 8.1. to send top
notch investigators out to the Philippines to
round up collaborators reported holding high
officers in the post-war Commonwealth gov
ernment set-up.
And it's high time. From news-locked Manila
there has come almost no word concerning the
political order of the government since the
islands were liberated. But from returned in
ternees and other persons who have been in
a position to observe what is going on there,
have come reports, some perhaps exaggerated,
of a virtual military dictatorship existing in
the islands now. And these persons have
also verified and elaborated reports trickling
through that top collaborators hold a position
of supremacy in the civil government of the
archipelago.
The need for expediency in the political re
construction of the Philippines must be past.
And even expediency does not warrant the ap
pointment of men known to have co-operated
with the Japanese invaders to high business
and government posts. It's time the Filipinos
were allowed to have their own say as to who
will form the Commonwealth government.
But politics, even now, is not the chief worry
of recently re-appointed High Commissioner
Paul V. McNutt. The toughest problems he has
to cope with are food, inflation, and a new
nationalistic society, the Hukbalahap. The
Huk is a powerful, politically minded organi
zation that managed to control four Central Lu
zon provinces throughout the Japanese occu
pation. And now that the islands are out from
under the Japanese heel, the Huk is campaign
ing for collective bargaining, an eight-hour
day, and nationalized public utilities.
To add to political tension is the lack of any
centralized leadership. Quiet, easy-going Pres
ident Sergio Osmena has none of the wiry,
fiery magnetism that marked his late prede
cessor, Manuel Quezon. Quezon held the Fili
pino people together; to them, he was the Phil
ippines. Osmena, on the other hand, has re
ceived only half-hearted support from the citi
zens of his country, many of whom openly
resent him because he escaped from the islands
before the Japanese took over. And on top of
that, two of his sons are charged with collabo
ration, and there is loose talk that Osmena him
self is not free from that incriminating charge.
What Filipinos need most is another Manuel
Quezon. Lacking that, the next best answer to
their troubles would be the whole-hearted sup
port and co-operation of the American people
a support and co-operation they richly de
serve. Filipinos fought hard and well during
the war. Their largest city and capital, Manila,
was fought through inch by inch, and is today
80 per cent leveled. Filipinos endured daily
torture, privation, and insult from occupying
Japanese troops, and or over three years of
suffering and indignities remained loyal to the
United States.
The average Filipino has not objected to
American rule; and, at least until the start of the
War, didn't really care whether or not his nation
v, r ould gain the independence promised it in
l r i46. He is grateful to the Americans for bring
ing, him peace, security, democracy, and a
higher standard of living than any other nation
in the Orient, with the possible exception of
Japan.
It is doubtful that the average Filipino, faced
With the problem of sheer survival that con
fronts him today, is much worried over the
question as to whether his independence will
come next year as promised. And, although
President Osmena has been quietly plugging

away for independence in '46, it is doubtful
whether the United States will see fit to grant
that independence so soon.
What Filipinos must have now is food, a
home government they can trust and believe
in, a stabilized currency, and ample opportunity
to get their country back on its economic feet
as soon as possible. If we Americans support
them in reconstruction half aat much as they
fought for us in wartime, they should be able
to realize these goals before too many years
have passed.—M. S.
