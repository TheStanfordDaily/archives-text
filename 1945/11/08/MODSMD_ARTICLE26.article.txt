We are nothing but impressed with the list
of articles to be auctioned off Friday evening
in the Education Auditorium in connection with
the Eighth War Loan Drive.
Janie Sontheimer has rounded up an envi
able group of goodies which will go to the
highest bidders. The thing that I won't miss
is that pair of knit socks by Lorrain Streblow.
Size lIV 2, please! Another thing: I'm certainly
going to cultivate a fond acquaintance with the
guy who wins the eight cover charges at the
Mark. He'll be my boy from here on out.

I got a terrific charge out of a story carried
in a San Francisco paper yesterday concerning
a group of 22 Japanese soldiers and one 18-year
old geisha girl who had been hiding out in
the jungles of Guam since its re-occupation by
American forces. It seems the jokers didn't
know the war was over until they saw the sur
render pictures in a late issue of Life magazine.
It was only then that they gave themselves up
to the authorities. These darned circulation
managers will do anything to increase their
magazine sales!
ir it -k
And now a jet plane has been clocked at 605
miles per hour. A good portion of the bikes on
Quad between classes in the morning could
give it a run, I'm sure. This department is all
in favor of setting up first-aid stations up and
down the Row and on down to the English cor
ner. I'm getting tired of bandaging wounds
and applying artificial respiration on my way
to class. Excom please take note!
I received a letter today from a friend of
mine attending another college here on the
West Coast which was very interesting. It
seems he read my column on how to date and
carry out a romantic campaign with the differ
ent types of Stanford women. He added that
he had learned a new technigue which would
make mine obsolete. Something like automic
energy, or something. . . . Ah, these post-war
improvements. Such potentialities.
