### Elliot Epsteen 
Molotov has spoken to open the celebration
of the October Days, the revolution that put
the Bolsheviks in power. He talked of atom
bombs, of the London Conference, and of future
Russian policy.
He said that certain people are trying to es
tablish an imperialism of atomic power. He did
not say "nations," thus avoiding insulting the
national pride of those in our Congress who
are fighting for internationalization of the
atomic bomb. He remarked that Russia would
soon have that secret and others too, in order
to help make their nation flower.
LONDON
As for London, he candidly admitted that this
was a flop. However, about future Russian
policy, he said that Russia would always try
to work with us, and be a bulwark for world
peace.
In comment on the speech, he is probably
right in saying that Russia will soon have atomic
power. The jet plane and radar didn't stay
secret very long, and everybody was so near
completing an atom bomb when the war ended
that it can't stay out of circulation forever.
However, Molotov made no comments about
Secretary Byrnes' solution to the problem that
wrecked London, a Russian sphere of influ
ence in the Balkans. Despite constant efforts
on all sides, that still remains an issue.
THE FUTURE
Russia now stands for peace. The deteriora
tion of the morale of the Red Army in Europe
shows that the Russian people are not psycho
logically prepared for new conflict, and won't
be for a long time to come.
But there is a definite issue in the Balkans,
and it might be the seed of future trouble. The
present reaction to armed conflict can't last
forever. Soon, Russia will have the means of
waging the war of the future, the threat of
retaliation to any atom bomb attack plus her
tremendous armaments now.
Molotov spoke in very general terms. Nei
ther Truman nor Byrnes has given anything
more definite. It seems that there is a source
of friction between the major statesmen of the
world, and nobody is quite sure of his ground
at this stage of the game.
