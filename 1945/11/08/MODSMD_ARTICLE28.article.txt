# Today Marks X-Ray Birth

### MARGIE HANSON 
Could he have realized what his
discovery would some day mean
to the whole world?
Fifty years ago today Professor
William Conrad Roentgen discover
ed the existence of the X-ray. And
today the future of the whole world
is threatened by the atomic bomb,
whose discovery is the most spec
tacular result of the long chain of
atomic researches originating with
the findings of Professor Roentgen.
Publicized Results
According to Paul Kirkpatrick,
professor of physics, Roentgen im
mediately publicized his results. Ev
eryone in physics departments all
over the world began to repeat his
experiments. "They were all very
disgusted that they hadn't discovered
it," Mr. Kirkpatrick said.
"November 8, 1895, could also be
considered the birthday of atomic
physics, the day on which the mod
ern study of atoms began," Mr. Kirk
patrick continued.
"Twenty-five years ago this quar
ter Dr. D. L. Webster founded an
X-ray research laboratory which has
been in continuous operation ever

since and the research is nowhere
near completion."
Physics Laboratory
Dr. Webster, before coming to
Stanford in 1920, had made import
ant contributions in the field of phy
sics. A few weeks after he joined the
staff he instituted the laboratory,
which has been concerned ever since
with the study of the basic and fun
damental problems of X-rays, stated
Mr. Kirkpatrick.
"Laboratory research is directed
towards problems such as how the
X-ray is produced and how it is ab
sorbed when it meets materials,"
commented Mr. Kirkpatrick.
Contributions
Graduate students working for
their doctor's degrees and faculty
members especially interested in X
ray research have contributed from
the laboratory more than 75 major
scientific publications and numerous
oral reports to scientific meetings.
Dr. Webster, Professor P. A. Ross,
who was connected with the labora
tory from the beginning until his
death, and Mr. Kirkpatrick. have
been the principal faculty members
connected with the lab's operation.
Future of Physics
"Fifty years of work has produced
the atomic bomb, and the end is not
yet in sight," concluded Mr. Fitz
pa trick.
To commemorate the anniversary
of the beginning of atomic physics
the American Physical Society will
hold a symposium at the end of the
month in St. Louis. Mr. Kirkpatrick
will attend this meeting, at which
various authorities in the field will
offer a collective summarization of
all X-ray knowledge.
