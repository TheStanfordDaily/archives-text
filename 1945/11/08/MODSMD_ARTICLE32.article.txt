# Seminar Hears Talk on Bones
## 
### 
David Greenberg, professor of
biochemistry at the University of
California Medical School, spoke at
the weekly Biological Science De
partment's seminar on "The Dy
namics of Calcium and Phosphorus
Metabolism" yesterday afternoon.
Professor Greenberg stressed the
relation of calcium and phosphate
to the bones; 99 per cent of the
calcium in the body is in the bones,
and 80 per cent of the phosphorus is
also there.
This field is important in medical
science as it concerns the diseases
of rickets, scurvy, thinning of bones
with age, and those of many endo
crine glands involving the state of
the bones. It also concerns bone
fractures, which are dangerous for
older people but not for younger
ones.
It also depends on the physiologi
cal state of the intestine. Calcium
and phosphorus are stored in the
bones. Calcium when introduced in
a radioactive dose goes to the grow
ing parts of the bone, while phos
phorus is distributed well through
out it.
Insoluble calcium salts are not
absorbed into the bones. Calcium
oxalate is a good example. This is
present in rhubarb and spinach es
pecially, Dr. Greenberg said.
The main factors concerning min
eralization are the stress and strain
on the bone; vitamin C, needed for
healing; vitamin D, which promotes
absorption; and vitamin A, a regu
lating factor in bone growth, he con
cluded.
