### GEORGE ECKSTEIN AND LARRY FRANKLEY 
Musical Notes
One of the most newsworthy items
of late is 'the announcement that
| Woody Herman and his Herd would
i do a series of dressed-up jazz con
j certs. Herman, one of the most pro
i gressive of swing bands, will begin
| the tour of concerts next spring,
the first being in Carnegie Hall. Al
ready on the Herman program is
a concerto written especially for
Woody by Igor Stavinsky.
A disappointing angle is the ad
dition to the band of a harp, bas
soon, and French horns for certain
numbers, but even with these, the
thundering herd should be a great
j success. The arrangements of Ralph
Burns will highlight the festivities
although Ralph has heard from his
draft board and soon will be writ
ing riffs for the Army bugler. Mean
while Herman will be kept very busy
with his 2G-week radio series and
numerous nitery and theater dates.
Kenton Adds Sax
A recent addition to the Stan
Kenton organization is tenorman
Vido Musso. Musso, formerly with
Goodman and Dorsey, has joined
other featured artists Dave Matthews
and Ed Safranski with the Kenton
crew at the Hollywood Palladium.
. . . James Crawford is being re
leased by the Army and probably
j will soon be back at the tubs for
| the Jimmy Luncef'ord unit. . . . Art
Tatum steps out of 52nd Street and
goes on a concert tour covering the
mid western cities and beginning late
this :nonth.
Of All Things Department
A school for popular musicians
is being planned by Shep Fields of
rippling rhythm "fame." Pardon us
j lor pointing, but we think that
j "Saxy" Shep should be the first to
I enroll . . . as a freshman. . . . The
i Frank Sinatra intolerance movie
I short is being very well received
by the public. Crosby and Hope are
I expected to follow through if the
j*e made by "The Thin
[ Man" proves successful.
I Ellington Loses Nance
Ray Nance has severed relations
with the Ellington group. The rea
| son is not known, and the brilliant
| trumpet, violin, and vocal star has
j not been replaced as yet. Nance,
jit is believed, will be sponsored with
[ his own group by the Duke. . . . An
; ita Boyer will replace Kitty Kallen
j as the Harry James canary. . . . We
I caught Skinnay Ennis on Spotlight
; Bands the other night, and as far
las music is concerned, the Red
j and White Ball has nothing to worry
about.
Three Merry Old Souls
/
j Old King Cole plays "Body and
Soul,"
With a spirit that is mellow and
free,
i When he begins to croon, "It's a
Paper Moon,"
| The response is something to see.
Although our poetry may not be
| top-flight, our topic is. During the
! last few years, the King Cole Trio
has reached a position that no other
I group of its kind has ever attained.
New Additions
Originally playing with the trio
j was Oscar Moore on guitar, Wesley
j Prince slapping bass, and Nat "King"
j Cole pounding the 88 and vocalizing.
] This is the group that so ably ac
i companied Lionel "Pops" Hampton
on such sides as "Jack the Bellboy"
and "Central Avenue Breakdown."
When the goipg got tough, however,
| Prince left the combo for greener
I pastures, (Boy, is he sorry now!!!)
J and was replaced by a very capable
j musician, Johnny Miller.
i With the new addition, the king's
I men continued to employ the unique
j style that they had been using for
I the past years, and so it was no
J change in manner that finally
I brought them success with their re
j cording "Straighten Up and Fly
! Right." From that point on. their
| rise to the top was nothing short
| of phenomenal, as such platters as
j "Embraceable You," "Gee, Baby,"
' "I Realize Now." "Sweet Lorraine,"
| "Paper Moon," "Body and Soul,"
j "I'm a Shy Guy," "Bring Another
| Drink," climbed the ladder of best
i sellers.
Method Imitated
Although Nat's method of singing
! ballads has been overdone by the
j King himself, the mellow eombina

lion of piano, guitar, and bass has
become so popular that ono can
hardly go through the day without
hearing one trio or another doing
their best to sound like the King
Cole Trio. Such groups as the Phil
Moore Four, 'Hie Four Blazes, and
Palo Alto's own trio from the House
of Lords are only poor imitations
of vhe real thing,
If th r ? public will only accept other
true jazz musicians in the way that
they have accepted the King Cole
Trio, then there need be no fear
concerning the extinction of Ameri
can nusic.

Musical Notes
One of the most newsworthy items
of late is 'the announcement that
| Woody Herman and his Herd would
i do a series of dressed-up jazz con
j certs. Herman, one of the most pro
i gressive of swing bands, will begin
| the tour of concerts next spring,
the first being in Carnegie Hall. Al
ready on the Herman program is
a concerto written especially for
Woody by Igor Stavinsky.
A disappointing angle is the ad
dition to the band of a harp, bas
soon, and French horns for certain
numbers, but even with these, the
thundering herd should be a great
j success. The arrangements of Ralph
Burns will highlight the festivities
although Ralph has heard from his
draft board and soon will be writ
ing riffs for the Army bugler. Mean
while Herman will be kept very busy
with his 2G-week radio series and
numerous nitery and theater dates.
Kenton Adds Sax
A recent addition to the Stan
Kenton organization is tenorman
Vido Musso. Musso, formerly with
Goodman and Dorsey, has joined
other featured artists Dave Matthews
and Ed Safranski with the Kenton
crew at the Hollywood Palladium.
. . . James Crawford is being re
leased by the Army and probably

mid western cities and beginning late

Musical Notes
One of the most newsworthy items
of late is 'the announcement that
| Woody Herman and his Herd would
i do a series of dressed-up jazz con
j certs. Herman, one of the most pro
i gressive of swing bands, will begin
| the tour of concerts next spring,
the first being in Carnegie Hall. Al
ready on the Herman program is
a concerto written especially for
Woody by Igor Stavinsky.
A disappointing angle is the ad
dition to the band of a harp, bas
soon, and French horns for certain
numbers, but even with these, the
thundering herd should be a great
j success. The arrangements of Ralph
Burns will highlight the festivities
although Ralph has heard from his
draft board and soon will be writ
ing riffs for the Army bugler. Mean
while Herman will be kept very busy
with his 2G-week radio series and
numerous nitery and theater dates.
Kenton Adds Sax
A recent addition to the Stan
Kenton organization is tenorman
Vido Musso. Musso, formerly with
Goodman and Dorsey, has joined
other featured artists Dave Matthews
and Ed Safranski with the Kenton
crew at the Hollywood Palladium.
. . . James Crawford is being re
leased by the Army and probably
j will soon be back at the tubs for
| the Jimmy Luncef'ord unit. . . . Art
Tatum steps out of 52nd Street and
goes on a concert tour covering the
mid western cities and beginning late
this :nonth.
Of All Things Department
A school for popular musicians
is being planned by Shep Fields of
rippling rhythm "fame." Pardon us
j lor pointing, but we think that
j "Saxy" Shep should be the first to
I enroll . . . as a freshman. . . . The
i Frank Sinatra intolerance movie
I short is being very well received
by the public. Crosby and Hope are
I expected to follow through if the
j*e made by "The Thin
[ Man" proves successful.
I Ellington Loses Nance
Ray Nance has severed relations
with the Ellington group. The rea
| son is not known, and the brilliant
| trumpet, violin, and vocal star has
j not been replaced as yet. Nance,
jit is believed, will be sponsored with
[ his own group by the Duke. . . . An
; ita Boyer will replace Kitty Kallen
j as the Harry James canary. . . . We
I caught Skinnay Ennis on Spotlight
; Bands the other night, and as far
las music is concerned, the Red
j and White Ball has nothing to worry
about.
Three Merry Old Souls
/
j Old King Cole plays "Body and
Soul,"
With a spirit that is mellow and
free,
i When he begins to croon, "It's a
Paper Moon,"
| The response is something to see.
Although our poetry may not be
| top-flight, our topic is. During the
! last few years, the King Cole Trio
has reached a position that no other
I group of its kind has ever attained.
New Additions
Originally playing with the trio
j was Oscar Moore on guitar, Wesley
j Prince slapping bass, and Nat "King"
j Cole pounding the 88 and vocalizing.
] This is the group that so ably ac
i companied Lionel "Pops" Hampton
on such sides as "Jack the Bellboy"
and "Central Avenue Breakdown."
When the goipg got tough, however,
| Prince left the combo for greener
I pastures, (Boy, is he sorry now!!!)
J and was replaced by a very capable
j musician, Johnny Miller.
i With the new addition, the king's
I men continued to employ the unique
j style that they had been using for
I the past years, and so it was no
J change in manner that finally
I brought them success with their re
j cording "Straighten Up and Fly
! Right." From that point on. their
| rise to the top was nothing short
| of phenomenal, as such platters as
j "Embraceable You," "Gee, Baby,"
' "I Realize Now." "Sweet Lorraine,"
| "Paper Moon," "Body and Soul,"
j "I'm a Shy Guy," "Bring Another
| Drink," climbed the ladder of best
i sellers.
Method Imitated
Although Nat's method of singing
! ballads has been overdone by the
j King himself, the mellow eombina

lion of piano, guitar, and bass has
become so popular that ono can
hardly go through the day without
hearing one trio or another doing
their best to sound like the King
Cole Trio. Such groups as the Phil
Moore Four, 'Hie Four Blazes, and
Palo Alto's own trio from the House
of Lords are only poor imitations
