# Racket Material Green But Promising---Bugge
## 
### 
Coach Elwyn Bugge is looking to
the future. With all signs pointing j
toward an official Pacific Coast Con- i
ference schedule next year, the net
mentor is already giving the once
over to several prospects that are
taking his class this quarter.
Out to keep the once topnotch
record of the Farm in the racket
sport intact, Bugge is carefully
watching the tournament that has
just gotten under way in hopes of
digging up talent for next spring's
varsity.
Stanford students who have been
on the campus for the last few yeax-s
will remember that the last Card
tennis squad almost completely dom
inated the national intercollegiate
net scene. It was in 1942 that
Larry Dean, Ted Schroeder and a
host of outstanding players took
the college squads from all over
the nation by storm. It was an all-
Stanford singles finals and an all-
Stanford doubles finals. In addition,
Farm teams in the last few decades
retired one of the biggest trophies
in the net world after it had gone
from campus to campus for 16 years.
"But let's not look back at the
past," said Coach Bugge. "It's all
right to talk about what happened
in years gone past, but why not talk
about next year?"
Asked about the caliber of the
material that is now on campus,
Coach Bugge said that although it
is pretty green there are many of the
boys who are potential champions.
"It is inevitable that we must
start from the bottom," said Bugge.

"All the other teams will have the
jump on us. They've been playing
in actual competition throughout the
war."
Among the atftletes that have at
tracted the attention of Coach Bugge
are Taylor, Basham, Beisser, Miller,
Scofield, Dilling, Leong and Walker.
Several of these boys have im
mense possibilities if they keep
working hard according to the coach.
Beisser is one of the few athletes
out for any sport, with actual col
lege experience. He has competed
for two years with College of Pa
cific.
Scofield, who is also a pretty good
high jumper, is rated by Bugge as
extremely promising.
"If he is willing to devote his
time to tennis," said the coach, "he
would be among the high rankers
in a few years. Right now, the best
player on the courts is Leong, the
Chinese boy, and he should improve
too."

mentor is already giving the once
over to several prospects that are
taking his class this quarter.
Out to keep the once topnotch
record of the Farm in the racket
sport intact, Bugge is carefully
watching the tournament that has
just gotten under way in hopes of
digging up talent for next spring's
varsity.
Stanford students who have been
on the campus for the last few yeax-s
will remember that the last Card
tennis squad almost completely dom
inated the national intercollegiate
net scene. It was in 1942 that
Larry Dean, Ted Schroeder and a
host of outstanding players took
the college squads from all over
the nation by storm. It was an all-
Stanford singles finals and an all-
Stanford doubles finals. In addition,
Farm teams in the last few decades
retired one of the biggest trophies
in the net world after it had gone
from campus to campus for 16 years.
"But let's not look back at the
past," said Coach Bugge. "It's all
right to talk about what happened
in years gone past, but why not talk
about next year?"
Asked about the caliber of the
material that is now on campus,
Coach Bugge said that although it
is pretty green there are many of the
boys who are potential champions.
"It is inevitable that we must
start from the bottom," said Bugge.

"All the other teams will have the
jump on us. They've been playing
in actual competition throughout the
war."
Among the atftletes that have at
tracted the attention of Coach Bugge
are Taylor, Basham, Beisser, Miller,
Scofield, Dilling, Leong and Walker.
Several of these boys have im
mense possibilities if they keep
working hard according to the coach.
Beisser is one of the few athletes
out for any sport, with actual col
lege experience. He has competed
for two years with College of Pa
cific.
Scofield, who is also a pretty good
high jumper, is rated by Bugge as
extremely promising.
"If he is willing to devote his
time to tennis," said the coach, "he
would be among the high rankers
in a few years. Right now, the best
player on the courts is Leong, the
Chinese boy, and he should improve
too."
Coach Elwyn Bugge is looking to
the future. With all signs pointing j
toward an official Pacific Coast Con- i
ference schedule next year, the net
mentor is already giving the once
over to several prospects that are
taking his class this quarter.
