## 'Top' Visits Scrimmage 
### 
Yesterday afternoon a distinguish
ed visitor paid a visit at the loot
ball pracitce. None other than Glen
(Pop) Warner, one of the greatest
football coaches in the history of
the gridiron. Pop, in the infant thir
ties, coached the great Jim Thorpe
and the Carlysle Indians, and at the
twilight of his coaching days, was
the head mentor at Stanford. Dur
ing his coaching days he turned out
more Ail-Americans than cokes that
ar? served up by Strauss at the
Cellar, but the greatest gridder he
has ever worked with, according to
the originator of the single wing of
fense, was Ernie Nevers.
Getting back to the more imme
diate issues of the day, Marchie
Schwartz's grid aggregation again
ran through a stiff drill, with part
of the squad running through scrim
mage. The players were plenty tired
as they walked into the gym, as
evidenced by the sweat on Guard
Bob Currie's face.
A little disappointed that the squad
hasn't learned their plays any fast
er, but far from discouraged, Coach
Schwartz plans to work the boys
hard till all the "rough spots" are
ironed out, and then start stressing
some of the more fancy points of
football.â€”Levinson.
