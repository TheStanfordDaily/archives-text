# Branner Head Relates life
## Miss Hartshorn's Interest in Students Explains Her Being Dorm Director 
### KATHRYN OWEN 
Branner Hall looked awfully big
and empty to Elizabeth Hartshorn,
when she arrived several days be
fore the opening of fall quarter, to
assume directorship of the women's
dorm. This was the second time
she had been in California, and the
first time she'd seen Branner. "It
was quite a relief," she said in a
recent interview, "when this enor
mous building came to life, the mo
ment people started arriving."
For Branner's new director, this
was something new. She had had
a little experience <n personnel work
and had been a house fellow at Con
necticut College for Women for a
year, but this was her first venture
in actual directorship.
Her Past
Before coming to Stanford this
year, Miss Hartshorn had been an
assistant professor of physical edu
cation at Connecticut College, where
she had specialized in the practical
teaching and theory of dance. "It's
the Connecticut plan," explained the
vigorous young director, "to corre
late the dance department with the
drama and music departments, and

other fine arts divisions of the
school."
Miss Hartshorn, who had first
studied at Connecticut and then done
graduate work at Columbia, taught
for two years at a private day
school in New Haven, before join
ing the faculty at Connecticut.
Study of Dance
She continued her study of dancc
j mainly through special courses of
fered during school vacations. "The
time I spent last Christmas vacation
studying with Martha Graham at
i her studio in New York was fasci
nating," said the new director. She
' explained that the class was com
posed mainly of college dance stu
dents and teachers, and was con
ducted in a cramped studio. "I can
remember," she laughed, "how we'd
have to get to class early, in order
to get a place on the floor."
She added that the thing which
made contact with Martha Graham
so vitalizing, was this artist's phil
osophy of her art. was greatly
inspired by the sections of this coun
try," said Miss Hartshorn, "and es
pecially the west. That's why her
dance has been so thoroughly
grounded in the American tradi
tion."

Two summers when Miss Harts
horn was studying at the Bennington
School of the Arts and Bennington
School of the Dance in Vermont,
she received instruction from Doris
Humphrey and Charles Weidman.
She has also studied with Hanya
Holm in her New York studio.
Branner's new director first ac
quired a taste for travel when she
accompanied two student groups to
Europe in the summers of 1937 and
1938. These groups were under the
sponsorship of the Open Road, Inc.,
organized for the international ex
change of thought among students.
Vagabond Spirit
"I just didn't want to stay in one
place," said Miss Hartshorn, "after
I got back to the United States. I
wanted to have personal contact
with all parts of the country.
"This desire to explore and a
growing interest in being connected
with students in all phases of devel
opment in their college careers,"
Miss Hartshorn stated, "might ex
plain my being the director of a
college dorm in California."

I got back to the United States. I
wanted to have personal contact
with all parts of the country.
"This desire to explore and a
growing interest in being connected
with students in all phases of devel
opment in their college careers,"
Miss Hartshorn stated, "might ex
plain my being the director of a
college dorm in California."
Branner Hall looked awfully big
and empty to Elizabeth Hartshorn,
when she arrived several days be
fore the opening of fall quarter, to
assume directorship of the women's
dorm. This was the second time
she had been in California, and the
first time she'd seen Branner. "It
was quite a relief," she said in a
recent interview, "when this enor
mous building came to life, the mo
ment people started arriving."
For Branner's new director, this
was something new. She had had
a little experience <n personnel work
and had been a house fellow at Con
necticut College for Women for a
year, but this was her first venture
in actual directorship.
Her Past
Before coming to Stanford this
year, Miss Hartshorn had been an
assistant professor of physical edu
cation at Connecticut College, where
she had specialized in the practical
teaching and theory of dance. "It's
the Connecticut plan," explained the
vigorous young director, "to corre
late the dance department with the
drama and music departments, and

other fine arts divisions of the
school."
Miss Hartshorn, who had first
studied at Connecticut and then done
graduate work at Columbia, taught
for two years at a private day
school in New Haven, before join
ing the faculty at Connecticut.
Study of Dance
She continued her study of dancc
j mainly through special courses of
fered during school vacations. "The
time I spent last Christmas vacation
studying with Martha Graham at
i her studio in New York was fasci
nating," said the new director. She
' explained that the class was com
posed mainly of college dance stu
dents and teachers, and was con
ducted in a cramped studio. "I can
remember," she laughed, "how we'd
have to get to class early, in order
to get a place on the floor."
She added that the thing which
made contact with Martha Graham
so vitalizing, was this artist's phil
osophy of her art. was greatly
inspired by the sections of this coun
try," said Miss Hartshorn, "and es
pecially the west. That's why her
dance has been so thoroughly
grounded in the American tradi
tion."
More Dancing
Two summers when Miss Harts
horn was studying at the Bennington
School of the Arts and Bennington
School of the Dance in Vermont,
she received instruction from Doris
Humphrey and Charles Weidman.
She has also studied with Hanya
Holm in her New York studio.
Branner's new director first ac
quired a taste for travel when she
accompanied two student groups to
Europe in the summers of 1937 and
1938. These groups were under the
sponsorship of the Open Road, Inc.,
organized for the international ex
change of thought among students.
Vagabond Spirit
"I just didn't want to stay in one
place," said Miss Hartshorn, "after
I got back to the United States. I
wanted to have personal contact
with all parts of the country.
