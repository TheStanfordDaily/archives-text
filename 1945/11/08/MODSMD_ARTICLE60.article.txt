# Dowrie in Favor of America Continuing Loans lo Britain
## 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
If a loan lo Britain will insure a
sound financial future for her, it
will be a small sacrifice for our gov
ernment to make for the attainment
of world peace, believes George W.
Dowrie, professor of finance in the
Graduate School of Business.
With the end of lend-lease aid Bri
tain immediately sent over a delega
tion, and although the conferences
have been secret, "of one thing we
are sure: the delegation has come
in quest of a substantial grant from
Ibis country," declared Mr. Dowrie.
"Of another thing we can almost
be sure: Congress will not sanction
any outright gilt to Britain of the
three,to six billions which it is es
timated the British require."
Debate on Obligation
The differences of opinion con
cerning this loan are due to the
history and racial make-up of the
United States, added Mr. Dowrie.
"Some feel that we have won both
wars for the British and that they
have never displayed the slightest
bit of gratitude, in fact have exacted
exorbitant amounts for counter serv
ices rendered to our forces," while
others feel "Great Britain rendered
incalculably great services to us"
and advocate "forgiveness of all of
our existing claims and a generous
grant of funds."
Most of the debate on this prob
lem is the result of Britain's de
fault on her debts of World War I
and her obligations incurred under
the lend-lease program.
Payment of Debt Postponed
Because of the slow recovery in
Europe at the end of the war, the
original schedule of payments had
to be revised in 1923. and consider
able relief was provided. Britain
was counting on receipts from Ger
man reparations to meet her debts,

, Mr. Dowrie emphasized, but Ger
many, in a sad state financially,
was borrowing from private sources
more than she was paying to her
debtors.
Consequently Hoover proposed an
18-month moratorium until the eco
nomic crisis had passed over.
"Though Congress was willing to
give our Allied debtors a breathing
I spell in 1931, it still held to the
well-known Calvin Coolidge atti
ture, "They hired the money, didn't
they?"
Debt Payments Stopped
After this postponement not only
| had Britain's economic picture
l changed, but also there was even
| less prospect of payments from the
continent.
"The old 1923 schedule still stands,
j The upshot has been that all of the
score of Allied debtors except Fin
land ceased making payments. This
much is to be said for the British,
that although they have not lived
up to their ancient tradition of scru
pulous fulfillment of their contracts
they have done better than any of
the other's, Finland excepted," Mr.
Dowrie stated.
Try for Neutrality Failed
"I don't believe we should allow
British failure to fulfill the 1923
debt schedule in full to be given
any weight in the current negotia
tions for a line of credit. Our repre
sentatives should consider solely
what is best for the United States
and what will make the best contri
bution to the realization of our
dream of 'one world.' "
In 1934 the Johnson Act was passed
to prohibit loans to foreign gov
j what is best for the United States
and what will make the best contri
bution to the realization of our
I dream of 'one world.' "
In 1934 the Johnson Act was
passed to prohibit loans to foreign
governments in default on their
debts to the government. Also neu
trality legislation requiring cash for
the purchase of goods came as a
result of American resentment over
not being paid for World War I.
Britain entered into a new war, and

our determined effort to emairsh
our determined effort to remain neu
tral "ailed.
Beginning of Lend Lease
"Britain's fortunes were approach
ing their lowest ebb. Then Presi
dent Roosevelt summed up the gov
ernment's view with 'We should do
everything possible to help the Brit
ish empire to defend itself.' "
With this lend-lease began. Set
tlements for the products were to be
in kind, property, or direct or in
direct benefit which would be satis
factory. But the agreement was to
terminate with the end of hostilities.
Consequently President Truman
promptly ended authorization of
shipments after V-J Day, and the
need for entirely new arrangements
I was expressed, commented Mr.
Dowrie.
Lend-Leasc Ends With V-J Day
"The general position taken in
Britain was that, in view of her
| desperate plight, shipments of food
; and other badly needed supplies
should have continued without in
terruption."
The source of payment for these
supplies is still undecided. It is gen
erally conceded that unless Bri
tain's exports can not only be re
stored to their prewar height but
expanded 50 per cent more than that
figure, she cannot pay for the things
she needs from other countries.
Payment in Inland Bases
"The idea of exacting cash pay
ments seems to me to be definitely
'out of the window,' but there is
much to be said for making these
obligations to us the basis for ob
i taining island bases essential to our
j security, for being afforded access
I to important but scarce raw ma-
I terials, particularly metals, for ob-
I taining supplementary oil fields as
j our supply and rights of way for our
i planes."
Negotiations for a new line of
credit are secret, but certain condi
tions for a loan will probably be
set, emphasized Mr. Dowrie. First,
the United States will undoubtedly
require the abandonment of impe
i rial preference and concessions to
i members of the sterling bloc. Those
| who have acquired huge sterling
balances will be asked to scale down
the amounts due them. And third,
the government will request the
adoption of a program of moderni
zation in certain of Britain's vital
j industries, notably coal mining,
' iteel and textiles.
Britain in Dire Need of Help
"If Britain docs not obtain large
dollar credits from us, she will be
forced in self defense to withdraw
more deeply into the 'tight trading'
regime already in existence. This
would be bad for her and us.
"A Britain with a sickly economic
existence, underfed, badly housed,
with severely restricted trade, will
be a poor member of the society of
nations. It is decidedly to our in
terest and essential to the cause of
world peace and prosperity that she
be strong and in good financial
health. If the loan now under con
sideration will contribute substan
tially to that higher desirable
achievement, then it is a small sac
rifice for our government to make,"
! concluded Mr. Dowrie.
