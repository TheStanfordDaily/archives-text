# Dog Veteran Mauls Japanese Woman
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 7 (UP).â€”Rex,
a 75-pound German shepherd re
cently returned from two years'
war service in the South Pacific,
i leaped a seven-foot fence and se
verely mauled a 65-year-old Japa
nese woman in Berkeley yesterday.
Mrs. Ume Akata was given emer
gency treatment for severe gashes
and bruises after the clog jumped on
her while she passed the yard of
owner Fred Hoffler.
Hoffler, who built a seven-foot
fence around his yard when the dog
returned three weeks ago, described
Rex's behavior since then as "beau
tiful."
He blamed scent of the Japanese
woman for the dog's violent reac
tion.
