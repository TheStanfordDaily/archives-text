### 
By SHUCK MITCHELL
In the library there are six spe
[ cial collections all under the direc- |
! torship of Miss Jeannette M. Hitch- I
cock, Keeper of Rare Books.
These collections include the Al- |
bert M. Bender Room, which con- J
tains a typographical collection do- j
nated by Mr. Bender and his friends. I
The collection contains a nearly j
complete group of items from |
Greenland. Included in it is a good
file of a magazine, which began pub
lication in Greenland in 18(51, and
i ran an Eskimo translation of Rob-
I inson Crusoe in serial form. The
magazine was printed in Green
land.
| Bender Room
The Bender room also contains a
collection of art books, largely Ori
ental, donated by Mortimer C. Lev
cntritt. His collection of paintings i.l
- permanent display in the Art
Gallery. The books were donated
at the time of Stanford's fiftieth an- ;
niversary in 1941.
At the same time, Dr. Fredrick
E. Brasch, a Stanford alumnus, do
nated a fine collection pertaining to
Sir Isaac Newton.
Periodical Collection
Recently a 40-volume set of "The
Repository of Arts, Literature, Com- j
merce, Manufactures, Fashions, Pol
ities" was donated to the University
library by three alumni, Newton J.
Hale, Leon Sloss, Jr., and William P.
Wreden. This is the only library on
the West Coast to have a complete
set of the periodicals, which were
published in London from 180!) to
1928. In these periodicals are steel |
engravings as well as samples of the !
material worn at that time.
A Napoleonic Collection of busts,
bronze figures, toby jugs, and pic
tures is now on display in the Ben
der Room. Also shown is a trick !
chest made in England in about the j
seventeenth century, which was do- )
nated by the late Albert Hooper, .
who has also donated books to the
library. t
Robinson Iloom
Miss Hitchcock is also in charge
of the Robinson Room on constitu
tion and law. The Ilobinson Collec
tion contains a number of steel en
gravings, including all the Presi
dents with the exception of Presi
dent Truman. The autographs on
ihe pictures are authentic from An
drew Johnson to Franklin Roose
velt. |
The Charlotte Ashley Felton Me- j
morial Library, donated by her [
daughter, Mrs. Kate Eikins of San j
Francisco, contains English and
American literature of the nine- i
tcenth and twentieth centuries. Mr. j
Felton was a United States Senator
from California. The room, opened
in 1929, is furnished in the style of
the twentieth century. In its col- j
lection is a check written by Charles
Dickens. Miss Hitchcock also has a I

chock of George Washington, which
was proved to be a forgery, and the
letter that goes witli it. Mrs. Elkins
founded the George Loomis Fellow
ship in American Literature.
Transportation Library
Timothy Hopkins, foster son of
Mark Hopkins, donated the trans
portation library in 1892. Timothy
Hopkins was a life trustee of Stan
ford. In this room is a picture of
the Big Four — Stanford, Crocker,
Huntington, and Hopkins —in the
transcontinental railroad. There are
early reports of the railroad, and
an article and a picture of Theodore
Judah, who envisioned the railroad,
persuaded its construction, and sur
veyed the route.
The Hopkins Memorial Room con
tains some of the furniture of the
Timothy Hopkins home, formerly in
Menlo Park near the present site of
Dibble Hospital. The room, fur
nished in Mid-Victorian, may be
used by small seminar classes.
Drama Collection
Miss Hitchcock is also in charge
of the Drama room, which is the
only room from which books may
bo taken. Even then, the student
using the book must have a letter
from the Department of Speech and
Drama. The books in the other
collections may be used on the per
mission of the Keeper of Rare-
Books, Miss Hitchcock.
Since the war Miss Hitchcock has
had only one assistant, and has had
to do all the cataloguing in the col
lections herself. Even so, Miss
Hitchcock still thinks that she has
the best job in the library.

At the same time, Dr. Fredrick
E. Brasch, a Stanford alumnus, do
nated a fine collection pertaining to
Sir Isaac Newton.
Periodical Collection
Recently a 40-volume set of "The
Repository of Arts, Literature, Com- j
merce, Manufactures, Fashions, Pol
ities" was donated to the University
library by three alumni, Newton J.
Hale, Leon Sloss, Jr., and William P.
Wreden. This is the only library on
the West Coast to have a complete
set of the periodicals, which were
published in London from 180!) to
1928. In these periodicals are steel |
engravings as well as samples of the !
material worn at that time.
A Napoleonic Collection of busts,
bronze figures, toby jugs, and pic
tures is now on display in the Ben
der Room. Also shown is a trick !
chest made in England in about the j
seventeenth century, which was do- )
nated by the late Albert Hooper, .
who has also donated books to the
library. t
Robinson Iloom
Miss Hitchcock is also in charge
of the Robinson Room on constitu
tion and law. The Ilobinson Collec
tion contains a number of steel en
gravings, including all the Presi
dents with the exception of Presi
dent Truman. The autographs on
ihe pictures are authentic from An
drew Johnson to Franklin Roose
velt. |
The Charlotte Ashley Felton Me- j
morial Library, donated by her [
daughter, Mrs. Kate Eikins of San j
Francisco, contains English and
American literature of the nine- i
tcenth and twentieth centuries. Mr. j
Felton was a United States Senator
from California. The room, opened
in 1929, is furnished in the style of
the twentieth century. In its col- j
lection is a check written by Charles
Dickens. Miss Hitchcock also has a I

chock of George Washington, which
was proved to be a forgery, and the
letter that goes witli it. Mrs. Elkins
founded the George Loomis Fellow
ship in American Literature.
Transportation Library
Timothy Hopkins, foster son of
Mark Hopkins, donated the trans
portation library in 1892. Timothy
Hopkins was a life trustee of Stan
ford. In this room is a picture of
the Big Four — Stanford, Crocker,
Huntington, and Hopkins —in the
transcontinental railroad. There are
early reports of the railroad, and
an article and a picture of Theodore
Judah, who envisioned the railroad,
persuaded its construction, and sur
veyed the route.
The Hopkins Memorial Room con
tains some of the furniture of the
Timothy Hopkins home, formerly in
Menlo Park near the present site of
Dibble Hospital. The room, fur
nished in Mid-Victorian, may be
used by small seminar classes.
Drama Collection
Miss Hitchcock is also in charge
of the Drama room, which is the
only room from which books may
bo taken. Even then, the student
using the book must have a letter
from the Department of Speech and
Drama. The books in the other
collections may be used on the per
mission of the Keeper of Rare-
Books, Miss Hitchcock.
Since the war Miss Hitchcock has
had only one assistant, and has had
to do all the cataloguing in the col
lections herself. Even so, Miss
Hitchcock still thinks that she has
the best job in the library.

of the Robinson Room on constitu
tion and law. The Ilobinson Collec
tion contains a number of steel en
gravings, including all the Presi
dents with the exception of Presi
dent Truman. The autographs on

The Charlotte Ashley Felton Me- j
morial Library, donated by her [
daughter, Mrs. Kate Eikins of San j
Francisco, contains English and
American literature of the nine- i
tcenth and twentieth centuries. Mr. j
Felton was a United States Senator
from California. The room, opened
in 1929, is furnished in the style of
the twentieth century. In its col- j
lection is a check written by Charles
Dickens. Miss Hitchcock also has a I

chock of George Washington, which
was proved to be a forgery, and the
letter that goes witli it. Mrs. Elkins
founded the George Loomis Fellow
ship in American Literature.
Transportation Library
Timothy Hopkins, foster son of
Mark Hopkins, donated the trans
portation library in 1892. Timothy
Hopkins was a life trustee of Stan
ford. In this room is a picture of
the Big Four — Stanford, Crocker,
Huntington, and Hopkins —in the
transcontinental railroad. There are
early reports of the railroad, and
an article and a picture of Theodore
Judah, who envisioned the railroad,
persuaded its construction, and sur
veyed the route.
The Hopkins Memorial Room con
tains some of the furniture of the
Timothy Hopkins home, formerly in
Menlo Park near the present site of
Dibble Hospital. The room, fur
nished in Mid-Victorian, may be
used by small seminar classes.
Drama Collection
Miss Hitchcock is also in charge
of the Drama room, which is the
only room from which books may
bo taken. Even then, the student
using the book must have a letter
from the Department of Speech and
Drama. The books in the other
collections may be used on the per
mission of the Keeper of Rare-
Books, Miss Hitchcock.
Since the war Miss Hitchcock has
had only one assistant, and has had
to do all the cataloguing in the col
lections herself. Even so, Miss
Hitchcock still thinks that she has
the best job in the library.
