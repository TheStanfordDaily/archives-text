# Curious Case Caused By Undecided Balloter
## 
### 
BUFFALO, N.Y., Nov. 6 (UP).â€”
j The voter who didn't vote posed a
! problem for a brief while today in
j a local voting booth.
Apparently unable to make up his
mind, the unidentified balloter
j crawled under the locked curtain
to make his exit because he hadn't
operated the voting-machine levers.
Stumped for a minutee as to how
to solve the "case of the locked cur
tain," election inspectors phoned
Board of Elections Secretary Glenn
J. Shultes.
I Shultes answered easily, "Just
| let the next voter crawl under the
j curtain to get in."
