# Stanford Indians Bid Bonds at Auction Tonight
## Three Open Dances Set for Tomorrow; Formals and Informal--'Toss a Coin' Russians 'Jazz It' at Lathrop 
### 
Russian atmosphere, but strictly
American food â€”that's the formula
for Lathrop's first formal, the "Ba
lalaika Ball," Saturday evening
from 9 to 1.
The entire student body is in
vited to Lathrop House, "the third
house up the Row," Saturday night,
according to Kallie Tremaine, gen
eral chairman. "We hope everyone
will come," Miss Tremaine stated.
Russia, Here Ah Come
Lathrop House will be trans
formed into a Russian village in
winter. Contrasting with the win
try effect will be the light from
many candles and big log fires. Gay
peasant scenes and bright colors
will dominate the decorations, ac
cording to Carol Persson, chairman.
For refreshments, guests will go
to a Russian inn. Decidedly Ameri
can, though, will be the punch,
sandwiches, and cakes served.
American, too, will be the music of
Jimmy Walters which will feature
the latest swing instead of Russian
folk music.
Arrangements
Assisting Miss Tremaine with ar
rangements will be Miss Perssons,
decorations; Janet Ossman, in
charge of refreshments; Nancy De-
Groot, head of the patrons com
mittee; and Beaty O'Hair, who ar
ranged for the music. Patty Whitte
more is president of Lathrop House.
