Ed Luce, pre-law senior, was un
animously elected to succeed Dick
Fayram as Inter-Fraternity Board
President at the Board's monthly
meeting in the Excom room last
night.
Inter-fraternity council, the or
ganization made up ot members from
individual chapters on campus, will
be reorganized at the earliest pos
sible moment, the board decided.
Board member Bruce Jessup, former
ASSU president, suggested the re
constitution of the council to "have
a wider representation of the whole
fraternity set-up."
Chapters Must Attend
Dr. Harold Bacon pointed out that
when the council is reorganized, all
active chapters on campus—those
which are rushing and pledging—
must send a representative to the
council meetings.
Board men suggested that meet
ings must be held for first-quarter
freshmen and men in the Naval
ROTC unit to acquaint them with
rushing and pledging procedures.
Faculty, Students on Board
Faculty members attending were
Dr. Elmer D. Fagan, Dr. Harold M.
Bacon, and John M. Stalnaker, Dean
of Students. Jud Crary represented
the fraternity alumni. Students on
the board are Tom Ashley, Bob Ken
nedy, Ed Hall, Jerry Moore, Ed
Luce, and Bruce Jessup.
It was suggested the report of the
Postwar Planning Committee be dis
tributed to local chapters.
