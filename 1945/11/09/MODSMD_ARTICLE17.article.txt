# Today Last Chance To Buy Song Books
## 
### 
Stanford Song Books will be sold
again today at the Cellar from 8
a.m. to 1 p.m. This is probably
the last time they will be on sale,
according to Frances Goodrich, in
charge of sales, as there are very
few books left.
Music Council has announced
that the following people aided in
putting out the song books:
Warren D. Allen, professor of
music and education; D. Sterling
Wheelwright, assistant organist
and instructor in music; Winifred
Lamb; Ruth Gumbrecht; Joann
Shipp; and Frances Goodrich.
