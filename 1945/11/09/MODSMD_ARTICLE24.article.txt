DETROIT, Nov. 8 (UP). â€”The United Auto Workers' Union exploded
the automobile industry's critical wage dispute today with a bitter charge
of unfair labor practices against General Motors Corporation.
A fonnal complaint was filed with the National Labor Relations
Board, charging the corporation with "failure to bargain in good faith."
At the same time, the UAW sent a separate appeal to the U.S. Labor
Department requesting immediate intervention in the "deadlocked" ne
gotiations with General Motors.
The UAW issued its blast shortly after postponing talks with General
Motors from today until 2 p.m. Froday.
As the wage issue headed toward an explosive climax in General
Motors, Ford workers across the country voted overwhelmingly to sup
port strike action, if necessary, to enforce demands for the 30 per cent
wage hike.
