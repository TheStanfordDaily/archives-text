DAILY STAFF NOTE

A large part of one's sense of loyalty, or
willingness to work for an organization, is de
pendent upon the people who work with one,
not merely through their ability to produce ca
pably and consistently, but also through their
personal contribution to the underlying spirit
or "morale" of that organization.
Any HCE, night editor, edit board member,
or Daily "alumnus" who has ever spent an
evening in the back shop of the University
Press will appreciate that as he says goodby
this week to the Daily's Mr. Jones, night fore
man, linotype operator, and makeup man.
Each of those staff members will remember
the late copy and lost headlines, the talks about
Bill, the pleas to "move that story up just a
little," the sound of the buzzer, the interested
and helpful suggestions for improvements "the
next time" while page proof was being read..
And most of all, each staff member will re
member the big part one man played'in holding
the Daily together during difficult wartime
years. This is our chance to say, "Thanks, Mr.
Jones," and "Don't say, 'sorry,' say 'dam
mit!' "

VICTORY AUCTION

New cars, nylons, steaks, radios, gasoline,
ski trips, football games, big name bands —
sounds good, doesn't it? Stanford thinks so; in
fact, many Stanford students seem to be think
ing of nothing else, for figures show that the
campus Eighth War Loan drive—the Victory
drive, funds of which are to be used to perma
nently finish the job begun December 1941
is falling far short of its goal.
It seems almost juvenile to be obliged to offer
expensive prizes for bond purchases in order
to entice students into contributing a few dol
lars that may go toward feeding a starving
child, bringing home a high-point man, or send
ing supplies to occupation forces. That, how
ever, seems to be the prescribed method, and a
group of hard-working students are planning a
big show for tonight in Education Auditorium.
Its success— the success of the whole Stanford
Victory Loan —is in your hands.

time of war, it is simply away of allowing for
full neutrality.
BYRNES COMPROMISE
There is nothing in this whole arrangement
that shouldn't be supported. Yet, on the eve
of crisis, with atomic bombs to back him up
in case of trouble, Byrnes has given in to Rus
sia. The arrangement he suggests is for the
Dardanelles to be open to all merchant ships at
all times, and for the United Nations to have a
say in the Straits' military status.
This will have its effects in Ankara and
London, and they should be fairly adverse.
Undoubtedly a multilateral conference will
be convened. Turkey, being weak, will have
little voice. Of the three provisions, the first is
reasonable, since an unprotected merchant
ship would have a difficult time landing troops
in the face of shore batteries. The second is
definitely unreasonable. The third is hard to
comment about, because it is so vague. It is
hard to say, though, what the final arrange
ment will look like.
Yet, in the past, Russia has embarked on
the policy of expanding her territories in the
name of trade and commerce, without bothering
to consolidate what she has. Some call this
aggression. The Russians call it legitimate ex
pansion to serve legitimate national economic
needs.
There is some truth in what the Russians
say. But the line has to be drawn somewhere
in order for the rest of the world to sleep at
night. The historical point of demarcation has
always been the Dardanelles, and the guestion
remains, why shouldn't it still be now?
