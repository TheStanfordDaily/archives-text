The classic question of the Dardanelles is be
ing reopened. Turkey's treaty of friendship
with Russia expires this week. The president
of Turkey frankly remarks that there is little
hope for a new one. A Russian army, with a
Bulgarian corps (IV) has been undergoing ex
tensive maneuvers on the Turkish border.
The situation is not new in history, but it is
still a sign of trouble. So Secretary of State
Byrnes has stepped in.
DARDANELLES DEAL
The old arrangement has been that, during
peace, any merchant ship could pass the Dar
danelles, but no warship could without per
mission of the Turkish Senate. During war,
merchant trade was blocked.
This is a quite reasonable arrangement. As
soon as a ship passes the narrow straits leading
into the Dardanelles, it finds itself in broad bays
with flat beaches surrounding them. This is a
perfect set-up for an amphibious operation. For
this reason, if a warship convoy once got
through the narrow and highly fortified straits,
there is no guarantee that it would keep on
going. For this reason, too, Turkey would al
low a single v/arship to pass, but never a full
convoy.
