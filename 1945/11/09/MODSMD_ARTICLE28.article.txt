The trouble with Stanford is that it places
too much emphasis on stuff like Tuesday Series
"Sucker Fishing in the Sierras" or biology
seminars on "My Favorite Amoeba." Reports
on these things might look awfully good in the
Alumni Review, but they aren't exactly in line
with progressive education, and go slightly
over the drowsy head of the average student.
They just don't have the emotional appeal to
compete with Cellar coffee.
Saturday, the Stanford Theater in Pall is put
ting on a show that should give Stanford and
its blah posters and topics a first-rate complex,
as far as progressive education is concerned.
It's an all-cartoon show, composed of 13 vital
shorts, hidden behind appealing titles. Besides
that, it starts at 9:30 in the morning—some
thing no drab, Stanford 8:00 o'clock ever
thought of doing.
Advertising for the show has been very
ingenious too. The standard ad that has been
running in the Paly Times begins with a big
"Hey, Kids!" Get the appeal there? The col
lege person wants to be young—none of this
men and women stuff for him.
The shorts themselves are things that might
be substituted for classroom lectures. The title
of one of the shorts, for instance, is "Lulu Gets
Birdie." We can't tell anything from the title,
except that the main character will be Little
Lulu. The mere fact, though, that a student
knows he'll receive a practical lesson every
morning from Little Lulu, will draw more people
into a class than any number of Phi Bete keys
that an ordinary professor might have to offer.
The word "bird" has such varied meanings
at Stanford that a film of this sort might be
used in a course in anything from Psych to
Biology. "Lulu Gets Birdie" might be a cartoon
study of a psychological case, in which Lulu
thinks she has become obnoxious to her friends
and has developed a complex for that reason.
She has become queer-birdie.
Or this same title might indicate that Lulu
has become ill. Don't you see how much more
punch a scientific course would have, if it spe
cialized in the pictorial case history of Little
Lulu, rather than dwelling on the ailments of
my favorite skinned cat?
A title of one of the other cartoons listed is
"A Wolf's Tale." I don't know quite which
department at Stanford could use this short, but
it should be fitted in somewhere. We're paying
for a liberal education, aren't we?
The Poli Sci department might easily use
another of the films, "Her Honor the Mare."
The average student could doubtless grasp
more from this one short cartoon than from
dozens of periods of lecturing and volumes of
statistics on the place of women in politics.
There's nothing wrong really with spending
a quarter with a bunch of meaningless bones
in the study of zoology, but think how much
more alive the course would be, accompanied
by the cartoon "Pluto at the Zoo." This isn't
intended as a slur at learned instructors, but
somehow they just don't have the appeal that
a personalized tour with Pluto would have.
And the specimens in the zoo v/ould be more
than mere bones, too.
In short, this show Saturday is something
well worth the attention of everyone at Stan
ford. Admission is 25 cents, and 44 cents for
faculty members who are open to suggestions
for popularization and modernization of their
courses.
