# Dr. McBain Tells Flight To Russia
## 
### 
"Science is primarily internation
al," Dr. James W. Mcßain, profes
sor of chemistry, told a student au
dience at the YWCA lounge yester
day afternoon, as he made his first
report before an all-student au
dience on his "Flight to Russia."
Dr. Mcßain flew to the Soviet
June 4, 1945, as one of 17 scientists
invited to become special guest of
the Academy of Science of the
USSSR.
War Travel Slow
Due to wartime restricitons, the
scientific party took 46 hours to cross
the Russian borders, going across the
Atlantic from New York, across Af
rica, and then to the Soviet Union.
Dr. Mcßain returned to the United
States byway of Siberia and Alaska.
"They put me on a plane with four
tons of machinery," he told his au
dience.
"All our meetings in Moscow were
interrupted by musical interludes,"
he remarked, explaining that music
was a great part of Russian life.
"The Russians seem to be aiming at
an ideal of music, dancing and art,"
he continued.
Visited Plants, Institutes
"We were shown everything we
could possibly see," he explained. "I
talked before various institutes, and
visited industrial plants where they
told us formulas and gave us sam
ples, specimens, and books. Only last
week I received my collection of
samples."
Dr. Mcßain illustrated his talk
with a map of his trip, photographs
of Russia, and pamphlets and news
papers he was given there.
"All the scientists in our party
agreed on the impression of vast
Russian scientific activity," he ex
plained. "Their long range program
of fundamental science continued
even during the war."
Favor Given to Scientists
"The Soviet Union, during the
struggle for actual existence, defer
red all scientists . . . even those in
'impractical sciences."
When war ended, Dr. Mcßain ex
plained, they first rebuilt the schools,
then the factories. "Children come
first in Russia," he continued, "then
production."
"The Russians have a tremendous
faith in the possibilities of science,
amounting almost to religion," he
said. Dr. Mcßain illustrated the re
spect granted scientists, by explain
ing that Stalin, who rarely appears
even in diplomatic circles, gave a
special banquet for the visiting sci
entists.
Sees Victory Parade
Dr. Mcßain also witnessed the
"Victory Parade" in Russia, in a
special set near the reviewing stand
with the other internationally fa
mous scientists in the Soviet Acad
emy party.
Dr. Mcßain summarized his com
ments on Russia, with the observa
tion that Russia was scientifically
international minded. "They par
ticularly wish to promote inter
change of scientific data, students,
scientists, and books," he told his au
dience.
The "Flight to Russia" talk was
planned by the World Affairs Com
mittee of the YWCA, under the
chairmanship of Virginia Butler.—

of fundamental science continued
even during the war."
Favor Given to Scientists
"The Soviet Union, during the
struggle for actual existence, defer
red all scientists . . . even those in
'impractical sciences."
When war ended, Dr. Mcßain ex
plained, they first rebuilt the schools,
then the factories. "Children come
first in Russia," he continued, "then
production."
"The Russians have a tremendous
faith in the possibilities of science,
amounting almost to religion," he
said. Dr. Mcßain illustrated the re
spect granted scientists, by explain
ing that Stalin, who rarely appears
even in diplomatic circles, gave a
special banquet for the visiting sci
entists.
Sees Victory Parade
Dr. Mcßain also witnessed the
"Victory Parade" in Russia, in a
special set near the reviewing stand
with the other internationally fa
mous scientists in the Soviet Acad
emy party.
Dr. Mcßain summarized his com
ments on Russia, with the observa
tion that Russia was scientifically
international minded. "They par
ticularly wish to promote inter
change of scientific data, students,
scientists, and books," he told his au
dience.
The "Flight to Russia" talk was
planned by the World Affairs Com
mittee of the YWCA, under the
chairmanship of Virginia Butler.—

"Science is primarily internation
al," Dr. James W. Mcßain, profes
sor of chemistry, told a student au
dience at the YWCA lounge yester
day afternoon, as he made his first
report before an all-student au
dience on his "Flight to Russia."
Dr. Mcßain flew to the Soviet
June 4, 1945, as one of 17 scientists
invited to become special guest of
the Academy of Science of the
USSSR.
War Travel Slow
Due to wartime restricitons, the
scientific party took 46 hours to cross
the Russian borders, going across the
Atlantic from New York, across Af
rica, and then to the Soviet Union.
Dr. Mcßain returned to the United
States byway of Siberia and Alaska.
"They put me on a plane with four
tons of machinery," he told his au
dience.
"All our meetings in Moscow were
interrupted by musical interludes,"
he remarked, explaining that music
was a great part of Russian life.
"The Russians seem to be aiming at
an ideal of music, dancing and art,"
he continued.
Visited Plants, Institutes
"We were shown everything we
could possibly see," he explained. "I
talked before various institutes, and
visited industrial plants where they
told us formulas and gave us sam
ples, specimens, and books. Only last
week I received my collection of
samples."
Dr. Mcßain illustrated his talk
with a map of his trip, photographs
of Russia, and pamphlets and news
papers he was given there.
"All the scientists in our party
agreed on the impression of vast
Russian scientific activity," he ex
plained. "Their long range program
of fundamental science continued
even during the war."
