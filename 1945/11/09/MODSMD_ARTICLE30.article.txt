# Roble Freshman Relates Frontier Life in India
## 
### NANCY DRAPER 
Previous to her enrollment at
Stanford, Roble freshman Ruth
Sutherland lived in India as the
daughter of a missionary. Her fath
er is stationed at a British military
station near tribal territory—a tri
bal territory that is entirely inde
pendent of British or any other rule.
"Every honorable man in the tribe
carries a gun," said Miss Sutherland.
"He'll beg, borrow or steal almost
anything for a firearm of some sort.
These tribesmen have even set up a
miniature factory for the manufac
ture of a gun that is a replica of
some very modern guns. Evidently
casts were made of the modern ones,
because these crude guns have "Dun
loy," for instance, spelled backward
and upside down on the handle."
Never a Dull Moment
"On the Northwest Frontier, there
is never a dull moment," she ex
plained. "Tribes have settled through
out the nearby hills but are in a
state of constant turmoil. The prev
alence of family feuds makes it
necessary for every man to carry a
gun," she added. In order to pave a
road through tribal territory, the
British government had to pay the
villagers more than plundering
would yield them. These tribesmen
support themselves principally by
ravaging caravans that pass. On a
road built by the United Kingdom,
one needn't -be afraid of the vandals,
for also included in the agreement
was the promise that the Indians
would never molest any traveler as
long as he stayed on the highway.
"But let a traveler venture one foot
off the British property, and he is as
good as dead," she explained.
Custom demands that the men of
the Northwestern Frontier Province
wear white bloomer-like trousers
full length with an ordinary shirt,
a tight waisted coat and the typical
turban, according to Miss Sutherland.
This outfit is augmented by a cart
ridge belt. In general, the women
wear the same as the men, but their
trousers are more colorful and va
ried, according to the family status
and wealth —the wealthiest women
wearing more variety in colors. Oth
er minor quirks in the women's

dress depend on the tribe, family
and locality.
"I Divorce You"
"If you want a divorce, and you're
a member of a tribe, all you have
to do is repeat 'I divorce you," three
times. That's all there is to it," re
lated the former resident of India.
"The Indians of the Northwest Fron
tier are Mohammedans. They can
shoot their enemies or any non-
Mohammedian without any twinge of
conscience as long as they faithfully
say their prayers five times a day,"
she pointed out.
The natives live in square huts
of mud, completely surrounded by a
very high wall to protect the women
from the eyes of all but her rela
tives. When she does venture from
her secluded life, said Miss Suther
land, hte woman must wear a heavy
cloak covering the entire body, with
a lace veil hiding her eyes. The lan
guage spoken is Pushtu, a mixture
of Arabic, Persian and various In
dian languages. The natives have
fair complexions, with very black
hair, and hook-like noses.
Camel —Or Walk
Camels are the prevailing means
of transportation when the native
is accompanied by baggage; other
wise, he walks.
Miss Sutherland explained that the
British cities of the Frontier are
hemmed in by barbed-wire entan
glements designed to keep out the
vandalistic tribes. Leading into the
cities, there are gates which are open
in the day time, but are promptly
closed to everyone at sundown. By
trade, the Indians in the cities are
shopkeepers, merchants, or are em
ployed by the British in some way.
The average city native lives in a
brick house closely resembling the
slums of America —small, dark, and
dirty.
Hospitable Tribesmen
The tribesmen are very hospitable
people—to their friends, added Miss
Sutherland. Callers are usually serv
ed tea and hard-boiled eggs. The
diet of these people includes meat,
vegetables (not a large variety),
wheat cakes, and tea. The Britishers,
however, subsist on the average diet
of meat, vegetables, cereals and eggs.

The former resident of India went
to an American grade and high
school in Mussoorie high in the Him
alayas, about 600 miles from her
home. This school was patterned
after the standard system in which
10 standards were equal to 12 Ameri
can grades. Woodstock, as the school
was called, offered the basis courses
and the grading was the same as that
of schools in the United States.

She arrived August 3, 1945, on the
Grihsholm to begin her college ca
reer at Stanford.

closed to everyone at sundown. By
trade, the Indians in the cities are
shopkeepers, merchants, or are em
ployed by the British in some way.
The average city native lives in a
brick house closely resembling the
slums of America —small, dark, and
dirty.
Hospitable Tribesmen
The tribesmen are very hospitable
people—to their friends, added Miss
Sutherland. Callers are usually serv
ed tea and hard-boiled eggs. The
diet of these people includes meat,
vegetables (not a large variety),
wheat cakes, and tea. The Britishers,
however, subsist on the average diet
of meat, vegetables, cereals and eggs.

The former resident of India went
to an American grade and high
school in Mussoorie high in the Him
alayas, about 600 miles from her
home. This school was patterned
after the standard system in which
10 standards were equal to 12 Ameri
can grades. Woodstock, as the school
was called, offered the basis courses
and the grading was the same as that
of schools in the United States.

She arrived August 3, 1945, on the
Grihsholm to begin her college ca
reer at Stanford.
Previous to her enrollment at
Stanford, Roble freshman Ruth
Sutherland lived in India as the
daughter of a missionary. Her fath
er is stationed at a British military
station near tribal territory—a tri
bal territory that is entirely inde
pendent of British or any other rule.
"Every honorable man in the tribe
carries a gun," said Miss Sutherland.
"He'll beg, borrow or steal almost
anything for a firearm of some sort.
These tribesmen have even set up a
miniature factory for the manufac
ture of a gun that is a replica of
some very modern guns. Evidently
casts were made of the modern ones,
because these crude guns have "Dun
loy," for instance, spelled backward
and upside down on the handle."
Never a Dull Moment
"On the Northwest Frontier, there
is never a dull moment," she ex
plained. "Tribes have settled through
out the nearby hills but are in a
state of constant turmoil. The prev
alence of family feuds makes it
necessary for every man to carry a
gun," she added. In order to pave a
road through tribal territory, the
British government had to pay the
villagers more than plundering
would yield them. These tribesmen
support themselves principally by
ravaging caravans that pass. On a
road built by the United Kingdom,
one needn't -be afraid of the vandals,
for also included in the agreement
was the promise that the Indians
would never molest any traveler as
long as he stayed on the highway.
"But let a traveler venture one foot
off the British property, and he is as
good as dead," she explained.
Custom demands that the men of
the Northwestern Frontier Province
wear white bloomer-like trousers
full length with an ordinary shirt,
a tight waisted coat and the typical
turban, according to Miss Sutherland.
This outfit is augmented by a cart
ridge belt. In general, the women
wear the same as the men, but their
trousers are more colorful and va
ried, according to the family status
and wealth —the wealthiest women
wearing more variety in colors. Oth
er minor quirks in the women's

dress depend on the tribe, family
and locality.
"I Divorce You"
"If you want a divorce, and you're
a member of a tribe, all you have
to do is repeat 'I divorce you," three
times. That's all there is to it," re
lated the former resident of India.
"The Indians of the Northwest Fron
tier are Mohammedans. They can
shoot their enemies or any non-
Mohammedian without any twinge of
conscience as long as they faithfully
say their prayers five times a day,"
she pointed out.
The natives live in square huts
of mud, completely surrounded by a
very high wall to protect the women
from the eyes of all but her rela
tives. When she does venture from
her secluded life, said Miss Suther
land, hte woman must wear a heavy
cloak covering the entire body, with
a lace veil hiding her eyes. The lan
guage spoken is Pushtu, a mixture
of Arabic, Persian and various In
dian languages. The natives have
fair complexions, with very black
hair, and hook-like noses.
Camel —Or Walk
Camels are the prevailing means
of transportation when the native
is accompanied by baggage; other
wise, he walks.
Miss Sutherland explained that the
British cities of the Frontier are
hemmed in by barbed-wire entan
glements designed to keep out the
vandalistic tribes. Leading into the
cities, there are gates which are open
in the day time, but are promptly
closed to everyone at sundown. By

lated the former resident of India.
"The Indians of the Northwest Fron
tier are Mohammedans. They can
shoot their enemies or any non-
Mohammedian without any twinge of
conscience as long as they faithfully
say their prayers five times a day,"
she pointed out.
The natives live in square huts
of mud, completely surrounded by a
very high wall to protect the women
from the eyes of all but her rela
tives. When she does venture from
her secluded life, said Miss Suther
land, hte woman must wear a heavy
cloak covering the entire body, with
a lace veil hiding her eyes. The lan
guage spoken is Pushtu, a mixture
of Arabic, Persian and various In
dian languages. The natives have
fair complexions, with very black
hair, and hook-like noses.
Camel —Or Walk
Camels are the prevailing means
of transportation when the native
is accompanied by baggage; other
wise, he walks.
Miss Sutherland explained that the
British cities of the Frontier are
hemmed in by barbed-wire entan
glements designed to keep out the
vandalistic tribes. Leading into the
cities, there are gates which are open
in the day time, but are promptly
closed to everyone at sundown. By
trade, the Indians in the cities are
shopkeepers, merchants, or are em
ployed by the British in some way.
The average city native lives in a
brick house closely resembling the
slums of America —small, dark, and
dirty.
Hospitable Tribesmen
The tribesmen are very hospitable
people—to their friends, added Miss
Sutherland. Callers are usually serv
ed tea and hard-boiled eggs. The
diet of these people includes meat,
vegetables (not a large variety),
wheat cakes, and tea. The Britishers,
however, subsist on the average diet
of meat, vegetables, cereals and eggs.

The former resident of India went
to an American grade and high
school in Mussoorie high in the Him
alayas, about 600 miles from her
home. This school was patterned
after the standard system in which
10 standards were equal to 12 Ameri
can grades. Woodstock, as the school
was called, offered the basis courses
and the grading was the same as that
of schools in the United States.

She arrived August 3, 1945, on the
Grihsholm to begin her college ca
reer at Stanford.
Previous to her enrollment at
Stanford, Roble freshman Ruth
Sutherland lived in India as the
daughter of a missionary. Her fath
er is stationed at a British military
station near tribal territory—a tri
bal territory that is entirely inde
pendent of British or any other rule.
"Every honorable man in the tribe
carries a gun," said Miss Sutherland.
"He'll beg, borrow or steal almost
anything for a firearm of some sort.
These tribesmen have even set up a
miniature factory for the manufac
ture of a gun that is a replica of
some very modern guns. Evidently
casts were made of the modern ones,
because these crude guns have "Dun
loy," for instance, spelled backward
and upside down on the handle."
Never a Dull Moment
"On the Northwest Frontier, there
is never a dull moment," she ex
plained. "Tribes have settled through
out the nearby hills but are in a
state of constant turmoil. The prev
alence of family feuds makes it
necessary for every man to carry a
gun," she added. In order to pave a
road through tribal territory, the
British government had to pay the
villagers more than plundering
would yield them. These tribesmen
support themselves principally by
ravaging caravans that pass. On a
road built by the United Kingdom,
one needn't -be afraid of the vandals,
for also included in the agreement
was the promise that the Indians
would never molest any traveler as
long as he stayed on the highway.
"But let a traveler venture one foot
off the British property, and he is as
good as dead," she explained.
Custom demands that the men of
the Northwestern Frontier Province
wear white bloomer-like trousers
full length with an ordinary shirt,
a tight waisted coat and the typical
turban, according to Miss Sutherland.
This outfit is augmented by a cart
ridge belt. In general, the women
wear the same as the men, but their
trousers are more colorful and va
ried, according to the family status
and wealth —the wealthiest women
wearing more variety in colors. Oth
er minor quirks in the women's

dress depend on the tribe, family
and locality.
"I Divorce You"
"If you want a divorce, and you're
a member of a tribe, all you have
to do is repeat 'I divorce you," three
times. That's all there is to it," re
lated the former resident of India.
