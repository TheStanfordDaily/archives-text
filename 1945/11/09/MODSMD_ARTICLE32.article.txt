# Faculty Club Hears Speeches On Jet Planes, British Labor
## 
### 
Combining two subjects of imme
diate interest in the modern world,
the Faculty Research Club presented
William Frederick Durand, speaking
on "Jet Propulsion," and Carl Fre
mont Brand, discussing "British La
bor and Russia" Wednesday evening
in the Men's Faculty Clubhouse.
Jet Propulsion
"A great opportunity for research
lies ahead in connection with the
field of jet propulsion," stated Mr.
Durand, professor of mechanical en
gineering, emeritus. "In a sense, jet
propulsion is in the condition of the
automobile industry 69 years ago;
there are many problems still to be
solved," he added.
Enumerating the problems of this
type of engine, Mr. Durand said
that since the jet propulsion plane
is used at much higher altitudes
than our present airplanes, it affords
many new problems for maximum
efficiency in the future. Maintenance
of assured combustion is a tremen
dous problem for the future, accord
ing to Mr. Brand. "It is comparable
to maintaining a flame in a gale,"
he said.
Ideal Fuel
Production of any ideal fuel for
jet propulsion engines, which take
a heavier fuel than that used in the
modern airplane engine, also is a
question which will have to be solv
ed, according to Mr. Durand. The
problems of materials of construc
tion, greater thermo-dynamic effi
ciency, design, operation require
further investigation. Our govern
ment will soon build the largest
high-speed tunnel is the world at
Moffett Field to assist the research
for jet propulsion, he stated.
Although jet-driven planes are
not adaptable to commercial air
transportation which utilizes rela
tively low altitudes, and it would be
difficult to specify any time they will
be in the future, the era of jet pro
pulsion power will ultimately fill an

important place in the airways of
America, concluded Mr. Durand.
British Labor
"British Labor and Russian Com
munism are not synonomous," em
phasized Mr. Brand, professor of
history, who presented the second
lecture of the evening. "While their
organizations are both collective,
there are many differences in the
methods of the British Labor Party
and the Soviet Union. The former
deplores the Russian methods of liq
uidation and revolution and takes its
precedent from democracy; Russian
Communism is not even a dictator
ship of the proletariat, but a dic
tatorship in which the proletariat
has no voice."
The British Labor Party was in
terested in and supported the Com
munist experiment in Russia between
the two world wars, but it constantly
opposed the Communist Internation
al movement throughout the world,
said Mr. Brand. The Russian atti
tude toward the British Socialists
is illustrated by the words of Lenin,
who said that he would like to sup
port Arthur Henderson "like a rope
supports one who is being hanged."
Opposed Intervention
"Labor party elements consistent
ly opposed the efforts of British con
servatives to enter the Russo-Polish
War of 1920 on Poland's side. Under
the leadership of Ernest Bevin, 22
party leaders issued a manifestation
of opposition to British-French in
tervention. The party still claims
credit for averting war," said Mr.
Brand.
"Since that time labor rose to such
a height that its principles on foreign
affairs have dominated British For
eign policy since 1931.
"The British Labor Party's atti
tude at the end of this war parallels
that of the last war: consolidation
with Russia abroad but maintenance
of democratic principles at home,"
he concluded.â€”Meg Thomas
