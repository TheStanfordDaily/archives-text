### 
At a meeting of the Stanford Fly
ing Club last night President Bob
Jones issued a call for all students
who are Air Corps veterans, or who
have had considerable flying time,
to aid the club in forming an air
team with the idea of competing in
an air mee,t with Cal and other
Northern California schools.
"The team would be patterned
after the group that flew here at
Stanford before the war," Jones
said. "Balloon busting, spot land
ings, and precision bombing would
be a part of their routine."
Harold Bissell was appointed
treasurer of the club.
Plans were made for the signing

up of charter members, after which
membership in the club will be
closed for the quarter. All those
signing up this quarter will receive
a free membership next quarter,
Jones added.
