With Barbara Beardslee-Grover Miller vs. Tappy Kimball-George Leong
definitely established in the finals Tuesday, things were quiet in the all
campus mixed doubles tennis tournament today. Already in the turna
ment, one upset after another has been registered and two unseeded teams
are entering the finals. When the tournament was started five weeks

go, Barbara Brooke and Gene Cor
man were established as definite
favorites to sweep through the op
opposition and win the Roos Brothers

cup. But, in the
quarter final
round, Con n ie
Wheeler and Tom
Scofield upset
B. Brooke and
Miller, 6-4, 6-4.
Then Wheeler
and Scofield were
established as fa
vorites in the
tourhament but

\/avu this was a fatal
error. As all other favored teams
had been beaten, Wheeler and Sco
field went down to defeat Wednes
day at the hands of Beardslee and
Miller, 9-7, 6-2.
Beardslee and Miller have gone
through the tournament so far with
out dropping a single set. Only twice
have they been pressed into extra
set games. They scored their big
gest victories when they upset third
seeded Mary Ed Davis-S. Chapman
and beat Wheeler and Scofield.
Kimball-Leong
Kimball and Leong have only
dropped one set and had their biggest
struggle against Virginia Hobbs and
J. D. Williams in the quarter round.
They won their semi-final match
from Marianne Supple and Joe Ow
en comparitively easily. Leong's
playing has been a standout in the
tournament so far.
Relative strength of the two teams
in Sunday's finals may be tested by
their matches so far in the tourna
