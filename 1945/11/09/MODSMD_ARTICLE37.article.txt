We are in the midst of a great grid season, but baseball news
has splashed the headlines. Billy Southworth has moved from
the St. Louis Cardinals to the lowly Boston Braves. This change
of managerial reins came as a surprise to most people, as it was
the general opinion that Southworth was getting along fine with
his bosses in the Missouri city.
He didn't grab the pennant this season, but his record still was
beyond reproach. And moving over to the perpetual dwellers
of the lower half of second division in the National circuit,
seemed to be no spot of particular note. But the developments
that have broken, or have become available to the public, makes
it rather apparent that Southworth knew what he was doing
when he broke off with the Sam Breadon run club.
GETS HIGH SALARY
First item of interest is the reputed salary he will receive for
cracking the whip in Feneway Park in Boston. A check for no
less than $30,000 per annum is the reported fee Southworth will
get. This amount is probably double what he got for running
the Cardinals, who are not noted for paying high salaries.
Mort Cooper had a little squabble at the beginning of last
season over the spondoolick situation, but the affair was eventu
ally ironed out by shipping Cooper over to another club in a
trade for "Red" Barrett, who surprised everyone, probably in
cluding himself, by winning a few games for the Cards.
CUT-SALARIES McCARTHY
The amount that Southworth will receive is rather high for a
manager. Even Joe McCarthy, the Yankee maestro who is gen
erally conceded to be the best manager in baseball, didn't—or
isn't—receiving any figure in the $30,000 region. And it's not
because the Yankees couldn't afford to pay Joe the highest.
Colonel Ruppert, the brew magnate, wasn't stingy when it
come to investing in baseball talent, and even after his death,
the Ruppert family put money across the board rather freely
for baseball players. It was just considered that a manager was
never worth more than around $25,000 for one season of baseball.
But along come the down-trodden Braves of Massachusetts and,
without flinching for a second, hire El Sehor Southworth away
from the Cardinal chain.
WHAT PURPOSE?
The Boston club can have two purposes in mind for signing
their new foreman of baseball. Either they are sincerely inter
ested in building the club into a potential flag-winner; or they
want to splurge the moolah for publicity purposes just to get
out big crowds to the park, just like Phil Wrigley of the Cubs
did several seasons ago when he slapped down a fantastic
amount of money for Dizzy Dean, long after he had passed his
prime. He probably figured Dean was all through, but attend
ance would bounce up like a good rubber ball, which it did.
While Dean was around, the turnstiles ticked merrily at Wrigley
Park.
But we are inclined to believe that the Boston moguls are
sincerely interested in building up a new club. Since they let
Casey Stengal go a few seasons back, they have had several
managers, none of whom have, been able to do anything with
the club. The club probably also plans on investing some money
for new players, and where the lowly club is going to get the
bankroll, we have no idea. . . . Maybe they found a bag of gold
under Plymouth Rock.

Park.
But we are inclined to believe that the Boston moguls are
sincerely interested in building up a new club. Since they let
Casey Stengal go a few seasons back, they have had several
managers, none of whom have, been able to do anything with
the club. The club probably also plans on investing some money
for new players, and where the lowly club is going to get the
bankroll, we have no idea. . . . Maybe they found a bag of gold
under Plymouth Rock.
We are in the midst of a great grid season, but baseball news
has splashed the headlines. Billy Southworth has moved from
the St. Louis Cardinals to the lowly Boston Braves. This change
of managerial reins came as a surprise to most people, as it was
the general opinion that Southworth was getting along fine with
his bosses in the Missouri city.
He didn't grab the pennant this season, but his record still was
beyond reproach. And moving over to the perpetual dwellers
of the lower half of second division in the National circuit,
seemed to be no spot of particular note. But the developments
that have broken, or have become available to the public, makes
it rather apparent that Southworth knew what he was doing
when he broke off with the Sam Breadon run club.
GETS HIGH SALARY
First item of interest is the reputed salary he will receive for
cracking the whip in Feneway Park in Boston. A check for no
less than $30,000 per annum is the reported fee Southworth will
get. This amount is probably double what he got for running
the Cardinals, who are not noted for paying high salaries.
Mort Cooper had a little squabble at the beginning of last
season over the spondoolick situation, but the affair was eventu
ally ironed out by shipping Cooper over to another club in a
trade for "Red" Barrett, who surprised everyone, probably in
cluding himself, by winning a few games for the Cards.
CUT-SALARIES McCARTHY
The amount that Southworth will receive is rather high for a
manager. Even Joe McCarthy, the Yankee maestro who is gen
erally conceded to be the best manager in baseball, didn't—or
isn't—receiving any figure in the $30,000 region. And it's not
because the Yankees couldn't afford to pay Joe the highest.
Colonel Ruppert, the brew magnate, wasn't stingy when it
come to investing in baseball talent, and even after his death,
the Ruppert family put money across the board rather freely
for baseball players. It was just considered that a manager was
never worth more than around $25,000 for one season of baseball.
But along come the down-trodden Braves of Massachusetts and,
without flinching for a second, hire El Sehor Southworth away
from the Cardinal chain.
WHAT PURPOSE?
The Boston club can have two purposes in mind for signing
their new foreman of baseball. Either they are sincerely inter
ested in building the club into a potential flag-winner; or they
want to splurge the moolah for publicity purposes just to get
out big crowds to the park, just like Phil Wrigley of the Cubs
did several seasons ago when he slapped down a fantastic
amount of money for Dizzy Dean, long after he had passed his
prime. He probably figured Dean was all through, but attend
ance would bounce up like a good rubber ball, which it did.
While Dean was around, the turnstiles ticked merrily at Wrigley
Park.
