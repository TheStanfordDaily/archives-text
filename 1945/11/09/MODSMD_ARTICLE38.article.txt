# Cal Invades USC; Huskies May Loose
## 
### PIGSKINNER 
The Golden (but a little tarnished)
Bears of Berkeley move into the
Coliseum of Los Angeles to meet
the USC gang tomorrow p.m. Cal
was never expected to be worth
much this year, especially after Rog
er Harding cast his lot with a pro
fessional club, neither was the team
expected to look as dismal as they
have.
They have Buck Shaw as coach,
and he is one of the best mentors in
the { game. Gridiron talent isn't too
bad, but the club has never "found"
itself all season, with the possible
exception of the Washington game.
Of course all their props dropped out
when Billy Agnew quit school. (It is
rumored that Agnew might return
to Stanford next fall).
Anybody's Guess
How they fare this Saturday is
anybody's guess. A few times they
have been hot, but more often they
have been colder than the food at
Encina, and probably USC will beat
them.
The Trojans are in a very peculiar
spot. They have lost their last three
out of four games, yet they are prob
ably one of the best teams on the
coast, barring, naturally, the fight
ing crew from St. Mary's. Their
chances for the Rose Bowl nomina
tion has practically disappeared, as
Washington now sits at the top of the
perch.
Washington meets the Oregon
State outfit coached by Lon Stiner
this week in Seattle. They barely
got by Oregon last week, and a few
of the wiseacres have picked OSC
to upset the favored Huskies. But
we can't go along with the idea. The
Pest Welch club knows what is at
stake, and if it's humanly possible,
they'll probably win the game. Yes,
yes, we know that LSU upset the
Charley Trippi lead University of
Georgia team.
Oregon vs. WSC
Oregon moves over to Pullman to
engage Washington State, the team
that played Cal to a 7-7 tie last week
in Berkeley. The whole Webfoot
line is green, but the Eugene school
has had the good fortune of having
Jake Leicht and Bobby Reynolds

around for backfield duty, and they
have given every team that has beat
en them a run for their money. Ore
gon will probably cop the tilt, but
if Billy Lippincott ever gets going,

the whole game is likely to explode
into a high-scoring affair.
St. Mary's draws a breather this
week-end, but will engage Fresno
State on Armistice Day in Fresno.
Fresno has done pretty fairly this
season, but they have nothing to
compare with the powerful Moraga
gang headed by Herman Wedermey-


BUCK SHAW
Not much luck this year ...

much this year, especially after Rog
er Harding cast his lot with a pro
fessional club, neither was the team
expected to look as dismal as they
have.
They have Buck Shaw as coach,
and he is one of the best mentors in
the { game. Gridiron talent isn't too
bad, but the club has never "found"
itself all season, with the possible
exception of the Washington game.
Of course all their props dropped out
when Billy Agnew quit school. (It is
rumored that Agnew might return
to Stanford next fall).
Anybody's Guess
How they fare this Saturday is
anybody's guess. A few times they
have been hot, but more often they
have been colder than the food at
Encina, and probably USC will beat
them.
The Trojans are in a very peculiar
spot. They have lost their last three
out of four games, yet they are prob
ably one of the best teams on the
coast, barring, naturally, the fight
ing crew from St. Mary's. Their
chances for the Rose Bowl nomina
tion has practically disappeared, as
Washington now sits at the top of the
perch.
Washington meets the Oregon
State outfit coached by Lon Stiner
this week in Seattle. They barely
got by Oregon last week, and a few
of the wiseacres have picked OSC
to upset the favored Huskies. But
we can't go along with the idea. The
Pest Welch club knows what is at
stake, and if it's humanly possible,
they'll probably win the game. Yes,
yes, we know that LSU upset the
Charley Trippi lead University of
Georgia team.
Oregon vs. WSC
Oregon moves over to Pullman to
engage Washington State, the team
that played Cal to a 7-7 tie last week
in Berkeley. The whole Webfoot
line is green, but the Eugene school
has had the good fortune of having
Jake Leicht and Bobby Reynolds

around for backfield duty, and they
have given every team that has beat
en them a run for their money. Ore
gon will probably cop the tilt, but
if Billy Lippincott ever gets going,

the whole game is likely to explode
into a high-scoring affair.
St. Mary's draws a breather this
week-end, but will engage Fresno
State on Armistice Day in Fresno.
Fresno has done pretty fairly this
season, but they have nothing to
compare with the powerful Moraga
gang headed by Herman Wedermey-


BUCK SHAW
Not much luck this year ...
The Golden (but a little tarnished)
Bears of Berkeley move into the
Coliseum of Los Angeles to meet
the USC gang tomorrow p.m. Cal
was never expected to be worth
much this year, especially after Rog
