## Truman, Attlee Plan Meeting On Atomic Energy Problems 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 8 (UP).—President Truman and Prime Minister
Clement B. Attlee will discuss the whole range of atomic energy prob
lems with special reference to their international aspect including Russia,
political quarters believed today.
There was growing belief, partly due to the increasing divergency in
the views of the Western powers on one side and Russia on the other,
that an invitation might be issued to Marshal Josef Stalin for a Big
Three conference to be held some time after the Washington talks.
The usually well-informed Daily Telegraph reported that the Presi
dent and Attlee would discuss the advisability of inviting France and
China to the big meeting of the big powers.
Attlee, due in Washington Saturday with Prime Minister W. L. Mac
kenzie King of Canada, said in Commons today that some of Britain's
leading scientists in the atomic energy field were now in North America
—the United States and Canada—and would be available for consulta
tion.
He said also that Professor J. D. Cockcroft, director of the new atomic
energy experimental station at Didcot, would be in Washington as his
special adviser.
Cockcroft, a Cambridge professor, was among British scientists who
went to the United States on the nuclear research which led to the de
velopment of the atom bomb.
