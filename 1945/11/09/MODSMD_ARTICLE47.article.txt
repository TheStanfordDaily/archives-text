MANILA, Nov. 8 (UP). —Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita's Japanese troops
brutally massacred more than 25,000 men, women and children in Ba
tangas province, tortured them with bayonets and forced hundreds of
men to leap into huge wells, witnesses said today at trial of the former
enemy commander in the Philippines.
Pamfilo Umali, who narrowly escaped death, testified that on Feb. 15
the Japanese took 700 men and "so many women I could not count," tied
the men in groups of five and Imarched them to a huge well where the
Japanese ordered the men to jump.
"We jumped as we did not want to be bayoneted," Umali said. "Two
hundred people jumped before me and 100 after me. Then the Japanese
threw many sewing machines on top of us and also huge construction
stones. Only seven of us survived when the Japs had finished."
