# White Calls Artie Ocean Mediterranean of Today
## 
### 
C. Langdon White, professor of
geography and geopolitics, consid
ers the Arctic Ocean as the Medi
terranean of our time. Speaking
before members of Stanford's Inter
national Club Wednesday, he ex
plained that "the areas bounding
the Arctic are the most important
and strategic land areas of today."
Mr. White stated that in a
"shrinking world where the air
routes are over the North Pole, that
area has become the cross-roads to
the world's capitals." He empha
sized the need for Americans to
cease being "flat earth thinkers" and
think of the world as global.
"Therefore," Mr. White said, "I
am convinced that America must
buy Greenland from Denmark, not
only for the interests of our own
defense but also for the interests of
world peace." In the words of Mr.
White, the world's last remaining
great continental ice cap has be
come the pivot point of defense in
the case of air attacks which could
come over the North Pole. Alaska
was also pointed out as a valuable
possession to America.
"We must be realists and real
ize that we are not living in an
ideal world, the kind of world
we would like to live in," Mr.
White asserted. "But we can still
work for that type of world," he
added.
Black Magic
In defining the term "geopolitics,"
Mr. White stated that at the begin
ning of World War II it was used
as a sort of "black magic formula"
to describe Germany's moves but
that actually it meant the use of the
facts of geography to determine a
nation's policies. Mr. White pointed
out that Germany considered not
only the economic, psychological,
military, and political factors in
waging a successful war, but also
the geographic factor.
Mr. White named Friedrich Rat
zel, Sir Halford J. Mackinder, Ru
dolf Kjellen, and Dr. Karl Haus
hofer as the leading exponents of
geopolitics. "In 1904," Mr. White
said, "Mackinder, an Englishman,
stated, 'Who rules Eastern Europe
rules the heartland; who rules the
heartland rules the world island;
who rules the world island rules the
world.' "
Heartland
The "heartland," Mr. White point
ed out as that area extending from
the Elbe River on the west to the
Amur River on the east; from the
Arctic in the north to the Himalaya
Mountains in the south. Europe,
Asia, and Africa include the "world
island."
"This theory was accepted by Dr.
Haushofer," Mr. White said, "who,
together with Rosenberg, wielded
great influence over Hitler." "The
Russo-German alliance was the ful
fillment of Haushofer's dreams, but
with Hitler's invasion of Russia,
Haushofer and Hitler separated," he
said.
U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.
Mr. White added that Haushofer
was convinced that Germany could
not defeat Russia because the latter
was a.country of "depth and a lim
itless rear." "Today Russia controls
the 'heartland'," Mr. White declared.
"For the first time in the history of
the world that area is manned by
a force sufficient both in number
and quality."
In describing the role of geo
politics in world peace, Mr. White
stated that under this situation
"world peace is possible if Russia
and the United States, which are
now the first-rate powers, can
play ball and can understand each
other."
Wars Not Inevitable

In answer to the question "Are
wars inevitable?" Mr. White as
serted, "I don't think human beings
have to fight. People don't want to

fight. Furthermore, men are the
most adaptable and changeable of
all the animal kingdom. They live
everywhere in all kinds of environ
ment. The desire to live is even a
stimulus against war. In the past
those who have not adjusted to con
ditions fall by the wayside."
Mr. White added, "I am convinced
man can emancipate himself eco
nomically." There is enough for
everybody in this world to live well
and get along together, he said.
Uses of Geopolitics
"The answer lies in men's hearts,"
Mr. White declared. "World War II
has taught that oceans are no longer
very wide, that isolation and eco
nomic self-sufficiency are nonsensi
cal concepts."
Geopolitics, according to Mr.
White, can give that intimate
knowledge of natural resources,
peoples, climates, and economics to
all the peoples of the world. Geo
politics of the "American brand," as
Mr. White called it, not used un
scrupulously or as a rationalization
for aggressive acts, can do away
with ignorance, one of the bases of
war.
"It puts politics on the solid bed
rock of geography, not power," Mr.
White stated, "and becomes the
guidepost of statesmen in terms of
geographic imperatives." Mary

geopolitics. "In 1904," Mr. White
said, "Mackinder, an Englishman,
stated, 'Who rules Eastern Europe
rules the heartland; who rules the
heartland rules the world island;
who rules the world island rules the
world.' "
Heartland
The "heartland," Mr. White point
ed out as that area extending from
the Elbe River on the west to the
Amur River on the east; from the
Arctic in the north to the Himalaya
Mountains in the south. Europe,
Asia, and Africa include the "world
island."
"This theory was accepted by Dr.
Haushofer," Mr. White said, "who,
together with Rosenberg, wielded
great influence over Hitler." "The
Russo-German alliance was the ful
fillment of Haushofer's dreams, but
with Hitler's invasion of Russia,
Haushofer and Hitler separated," he
said.
U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.
Mr. White added that Haushofer
was convinced that Germany could
not defeat Russia because the latter
was a.country of "depth and a lim
itless rear." "Today Russia controls
the 'heartland'," Mr. White declared.
"For the first time in the history of
the world that area is manned by
a force sufficient both in number
and quality."
In describing the role of geo
politics in world peace, Mr. White
stated that under this situation
"world peace is possible if Russia
and the United States, which are
now the first-rate powers, can
play ball and can understand each
other."
Wars Not Inevitable

In answer to the question "Are
wars inevitable?" Mr. White as
serted, "I don't think human beings
have to fight. People don't want to

fight. Furthermore, men are the
most adaptable and changeable of
all the animal kingdom. They live
everywhere in all kinds of environ
ment. The desire to live is even a
stimulus against war. In the past
those who have not adjusted to con
ditions fall by the wayside."
Mr. White added, "I am convinced
man can emancipate himself eco
nomically." There is enough for
everybody in this world to live well
and get along together, he said.
Uses of Geopolitics
"The answer lies in men's hearts,"
Mr. White declared. "World War II
has taught that oceans are no longer
very wide, that isolation and eco
nomic self-sufficiency are nonsensi
cal concepts."
Geopolitics, according to Mr.
White, can give that intimate
knowledge of natural resources,
peoples, climates, and economics to
all the peoples of the world. Geo
politics of the "American brand," as
Mr. White called it, not used un
scrupulously or as a rationalization
for aggressive acts, can do away
with ignorance, one of the bases of
war.
"It puts politics on the solid bed
rock of geography, not power," Mr.
White stated, "and becomes the
guidepost of statesmen in terms of
geographic imperatives." Mary
Virginia Pond
C. Langdon White, professor of
geography and geopolitics, consid
ers the Arctic Ocean as the Medi
terranean of our time. Speaking
before members of Stanford's Inter
national Club Wednesday, he ex
plained that "the areas bounding
the Arctic are the most important
and strategic land areas of today."
Mr. White stated that in a
"shrinking world where the air
routes are over the North Pole, that
area has become the cross-roads to
the world's capitals." He empha
sized the need for Americans to
cease being "flat earth thinkers" and
think of the world as global.
"Therefore," Mr. White said, "I
am convinced that America must
buy Greenland from Denmark, not
only for the interests of our own
defense but also for the interests of
world peace." In the words of Mr.
White, the world's last remaining
great continental ice cap has be
come the pivot point of defense in
the case of air attacks which could
come over the North Pole. Alaska
was also pointed out as a valuable
possession to America.
"We must be realists and real
ize that we are not living in an
ideal world, the kind of world
we would like to live in," Mr.
White asserted. "But we can still
work for that type of world," he
added.
Black Magic
In defining the term "geopolitics,"
Mr. White stated that at the begin
ning of World War II it was used
as a sort of "black magic formula"
to describe Germany's moves but
that actually it meant the use of the
facts of geography to determine a
nation's policies. Mr. White pointed
out that Germany considered not
only the economic, psychological,
military, and political factors in
waging a successful war, but also
the geographic factor.
Mr. White named Friedrich Rat
zel, Sir Halford J. Mackinder, Ru
dolf Kjellen, and Dr. Karl Haus
hofer as the leading exponents of
geopolitics. "In 1904," Mr. White
said, "Mackinder, an Englishman,

those who have not adjusted to con
ditions fall by the wayside."
Mr. White added, "I am convinced
man can emancipate himself eco
nomically." There is enough for
everybody in this world to live well
and get along together, he said.
Uses of Geopolitics
"The answer lies in men's hearts,"
Mr. White declared. "World War II
has taught that oceans are no longer
very wide, that isolation and eco
nomic self-sufficiency are nonsensi
cal concepts."
Geopolitics, according to Mr.
White, can give that intimate
knowledge of natural resources,
peoples, climates, and economics to
all the peoples of the world. Geo
politics of the "American brand," as
Mr. White called it, not used un
scrupulously or as a rationalization
for aggressive acts, can do away
with ignorance, one of the bases of
war.
"It puts politics on the solid bed
rock of geography, not power," Mr.
White stated, "and becomes the
guidepost of statesmen in terms of
geographic imperatives." Mary

C. Langdon White, professor of
geography and geopolitics, consid
ers the Arctic Ocean as the Medi
terranean of our time. Speaking
before members of Stanford's Inter
national Club Wednesday, he ex
plained that "the areas bounding
the Arctic are the most important
and strategic land areas of today."
Mr. White stated that in a
"shrinking world where the air
routes are over the North Pole, that
area has become the cross-roads to
the world's capitals." He empha
sized the need for Americans to
cease being "flat earth thinkers" and
think of the world as global.
"Therefore," Mr. White said, "I
am convinced that America must
buy Greenland from Denmark, not
only for the interests of our own
defense but also for the interests of
world peace." In the words of Mr.
White, the world's last remaining
great continental ice cap has be
come the pivot point of defense in
the case of air attacks which could
come over the North Pole. Alaska
was also pointed out as a valuable
possession to America.
"We must be realists and real
ize that we are not living in an
ideal world, the kind of world
we would like to live in," Mr.
White asserted. "But we can still
work for that type of world," he
added.
Black Magic
In defining the term "geopolitics,"
Mr. White stated that at the begin
ning of World War II it was used
as a sort of "black magic formula"
to describe Germany's moves but
that actually it meant the use of the
facts of geography to determine a
nation's policies. Mr. White pointed
out that Germany considered not
only the economic, psychological,
military, and political factors in
waging a successful war, but also
the geographic factor.
Mr. White named Friedrich Rat
zel, Sir Halford J. Mackinder, Ru
dolf Kjellen, and Dr. Karl Haus
hofer as the leading exponents of
geopolitics. "In 1904," Mr. White
said, "Mackinder, an Englishman,
stated, 'Who rules Eastern Europe
rules the heartland; who rules the
heartland rules the world island;
who rules the world island rules the
world.' "
Heartland
The "heartland," Mr. White point
ed out as that area extending from
the Elbe River on the west to the
Amur River on the east; from the
Arctic in the north to the Himalaya
Mountains in the south. Europe,
Asia, and Africa include the "world
island."
"This theory was accepted by Dr.
Haushofer," Mr. White said, "who,
together with Rosenberg, wielded
great influence over Hitler." "The
Russo-German alliance was the ful
fillment of Haushofer's dreams, but
with Hitler's invasion of Russia,
Haushofer and Hitler separated," he
said.
U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.
Mr. White added that Haushofer
was convinced that Germany could
not defeat Russia because the latter
was a.country of "depth and a lim
itless rear." "Today Russia controls
the 'heartland'," Mr. White declared.
"For the first time in the history of
the world that area is manned by
a force sufficient both in number
and quality."
In describing the role of geo
politics in world peace, Mr. White
stated that under this situation
"world peace is possible if Russia
and the United States, which are
now the first-rate powers, can
play ball and can understand each
other."
Wars Not Inevitable

In answer to the question "Are
wars inevitable?" Mr. White as
serted, "I don't think human beings
have to fight. People don't want to

fight. Furthermore, men are the
most adaptable and changeable of
all the animal kingdom. They live
everywhere in all kinds of environ
ment. The desire to live is even a
stimulus against war. In the past
those who have not adjusted to con
ditions fall by the wayside."
Mr. White added, "I am convinced
man can emancipate himself eco
