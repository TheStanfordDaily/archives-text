# Chaparral To Hit Stands Wednesday
## 
### 
Still at the new low price of 25
cents, the Stanford Chaparral, cam
pus humor magazine, will hit the
stands Wednesday, according to Ed
itor Don Allan. Reconversion is
the themeâ€”and these boys in the
Chappie offices are, according to
inside reports, really going to show
us how it's done.
Dick Dunbar has drawn a whole
page of cartoons, and a mystery art
ist has prepared a surprise center
spread for the issue. The cover,
drawn by A 1 Larson in four colors,
is a switch from last year's puppet,
photograph covers. The Chappies
will be sold in the Cellar and on
the History and Engineering cor
ners.
