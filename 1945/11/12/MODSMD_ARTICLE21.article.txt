# "Girl in Every Port' Opens Friday; 47th Annual Gaieties Runs Two Nights
## 
### 
"Stanford Goes Gaieties" this Fri
j day and Saturday night when the
47th annual Ram's Head production
| of Gaieties will he presented in Mc
i morial Auditorium.
"A Girl in Every Port," a theme
fervently dedicated to the Injuns in
Navy blue on the Stanford cam
pus, provides the basis for the songs,
dances, orchestral numbers, and acts
which have been under rehearsal for
the past weeks.
War-time Gaieties
This year's Gaieties is the third
since the title "Big Game" was re
moved from the annual production,
and according to Mary Lou Patton,
director, the musical will prove that
; Ram's Head has done a good job
despite post-war-time restrictions.
One of the songs in the Opener
of the musical states that "We'll
show you how the Navy ought to
be"—which is just what is done.
With that idea as a foundation, the
cast will take the audience through
countries and places of interest, with
i things happening as should never
happen to any gob. Even though the

j gobs wish it might.
Original Music I
All the music, dancing, skits and j i
songs arc original this year. Par- l
ticularly being stressed are tap and
j Spanish dances. Every act is cos- i <
I turned despite the difficulty of pro- ' I

curing material, according to Muriel
Hopkins, costumc director. As an
example of the difficulties encoun
tered, Miss Hopkins was in desper
ate need of some blue satin. There
just wasn't any within the budget
price range. So the ingenious cos
tume crew bought some white satin
and dyed it blue.
This Gaieties is one of the few
which have had a definite story
theme throughout the entire show.
Often the productions have been a
collection of variety acts, with
vaudeville inclination.
