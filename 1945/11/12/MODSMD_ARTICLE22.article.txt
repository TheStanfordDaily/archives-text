### MARTHA SCHWIMLEY 
A blazing torch-light parade, a new Cardinal team, and the old Stan
ford spirit will lead Farm students into the "Big Indian Rally" Thursday
night at the Pavilion.
For the first time in over two years, Stanford students will sec and
cheer a Stanford football team. Coach Marchie Schwartz will introduce

the post-war Red Machine at the
climax of an action-filled rally. The
team and the student body will
bring back to the campus an old
tradition of noisy, enthusiastic prc
ganie rallies.

According to the rally's co
chairmcn, Kuth Lcvison and Wal
ly McCall, the parade will Ik> led
by torches and a blaring jazz
band. "Mad Bon Bok and the
Boys," mounted on a truck. The
I procession will begin at the top
I of the How, will stop at the post
j office to pick up Lagunita and
Rohlc residents, and will proceed
to the I'avilion.
The "Big Indian Rally" will fea
ture all the color and originality of
old Stanford rallies, plus many new
ideas, assures Rally Corn member
McCall. Two songs written by a
student, Betty Stellar of Union Res
idence, will be presented. "Return
of the Stanford Rough" and "Stan
ford Girls Are Easy to Love" are the
new melodies Miss Stellar has dedi
cated to the Farm.
A trio of students, Marky Cleek,
Guyla Rtinyan, and Joan Bailey,
will sing one of the original songs
in a skit guaranteed to amuse
and surprise the students. Several
other skits, which will be an
nounced later in the week, have
been chosen for their color and
enthusiasm.
The Farm yell leaders, Newt Ar
nold, Bill Lippincott, and Charles
Jackman, backed by a reorganized
Rally Com in white sweaters, will
lead the cheering, which Rally Com
hopes will lop any .spirit shown at
past Stanford rallies.
Two bands, new ideas, and many
unrevealed plans will make the "Big
Indian Rally" an appropriate be
ginning for the Cardinals' post-war
activities. The rally will unify the
student-body spirit and will help
push the team into the stadium with
the backing of every Stanford stu
dent, say Rally Com members.
The decoration committee is
headed by Patty Robinson, Dot
Ilodges, and Bob Leefeldt. Post
ers are being handled by Bill
Blaisdell. Illic Costigan, and Bon
nie Hansen. The entire Rally Com
