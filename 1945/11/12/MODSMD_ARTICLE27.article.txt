Leadership Again

According to the proposed agenda for today's meeting of
Women's Conference, "Leadership" will once more receive
a going over fiom those campus women who, by virtue of theft
election, are leaders in our student government. Patty Patten,
head of Conference, has decided that such a meeting is in order
now ihat the house presidents have had sufficient time in office
to become acquainted with the routine of their jobs, and are—
cr should be looking forward to improvement in their methods
of presentation and discussion.
Because this issue of leadership, and the passiveness of
students who are categorically "being led," has been discussed
with discouraging regularity in the past few years, it is natural
to wonder if another such discussion might not be extraneous.
No criticism can be applied to those women who recognize the
need for improvement, and are willing to take a stab at carrying
it through. But the usefulness of th*se discussions is completely
dependent upon the reception given them by the women con
corned the house presidents themselves.
There is a notable tendency among house presidents to con
cense as much as possible the material which the living group
or Conference has reguested be presented; this is obviously
done as an encouragement to attendance, as the attitude is prev
alent among women that they do not have time to "waste" listen
ing to a lot of announcements.
This effort on behalf of the presidents is a generous one, but
one which implies from the beginning that the closer house
meetings come to being nonentities, the more successful they
are.
The purpose of house meetings is not alone to hand out an
nouncements—if so, a mimeographed sheet would serve ade
quately. Instead, the house meeting represents a weighty link
in the chain of student government; it has a reciprocal responsi
bility of delivering ideas and producing them.
To Conference come the suggestions of the Administration
for activities and conduct; to Conference also should come the
suggestions of the women students in these same matters, and
further suggestions of the women as formulated through thought
ful and active discussion in house meetings.
Discouraged house presidents can all too easily recognize
in their groups some students who will not be interested in
listening nor contributing, simply from the force of their own
habits. It is none the less their responsibility to actually com
municate the news of activities and proposals ip a way as nearly
as possible attractive to those who are chronically inactive, and
to encourage discussion from them.
Any deficiencies in leadership are therefore not to be laid
entirely to the house presidents. But these women are to be
blamed if their attitude is that the present situation is a hopeless
one, and one that is inevitable as proved by its long duration.
Our suggestions for improvement are largely subjective:
lengthen the house meeting if it is necessary in making them
more effective; try something out of the groove in method of
presentation, even if it borders on the absurd. Call on students
for opinions, ask different members to make reports instead of
having one person read all the announcements. Certainly there
are numerous ways to attract women to attend, and as many to
guarantee their attention once they are present. If the informa
tion has been communicated, and some opinions, however un
satisfactory to the president, garnered from the group, her re
sponsibility is at least nominally fulfilled. A minimum of six
hours of previous meetings has gone into the preparation of one
house meeting —surely all this is not to be tossed out the win
dow in a matter of a few minutes of announcements, simply be
cause the cry has gone up, "I've got to get to the Libe."
The A.S.S.U. constitution is based upon communication of
ideas back and forth from the living group to the highest body
in student government.
To neglect this responsibility of communication is to negate
the need for having the student rule with which we are so gen
erously and fortunately—endowed. B. M. V.

hours of previous meetings has gone into the preparation of one

The A.S.S.U. constitution is based upon communication of

Leadership Again

According to the proposed agenda for today's meeting of
Women's Conference, "Leadership" will once more receive
a going over fiom those campus women who, by virtue of theft
election, are leaders in our student government. Patty Patten,
head of Conference, has decided that such a meeting is in order
now ihat the house presidents have had sufficient time in office
to become acquainted with the routine of their jobs, and are—
cr should be looking forward to improvement in their methods
of presentation and discussion.
Because this issue of leadership, and the passiveness of
students who are categorically "being led," has been discussed
with discouraging regularity in the past few years, it is natural
to wonder if another such discussion might not be extraneous.
No criticism can be applied to those women who recognize the
need for improvement, and are willing to take a stab at carrying
it through. But the usefulness of th*se discussions is completely
dependent upon the reception given them by the women con
corned the house presidents themselves.
There is a notable tendency among house presidents to con
cense as much as possible the material which the living group
or Conference has reguested be presented; this is obviously
done as an encouragement to attendance, as the attitude is prev
alent among women that they do not have time to "waste" listen
ing to a lot of announcements.
This effort on behalf of the presidents is a generous one, but
one which implies from the beginning that the closer house
meetings come to being nonentities, the more successful they
are.
The purpose of house meetings is not alone to hand out an
nouncements—if so, a mimeographed sheet would serve ade
quately. Instead, the house meeting represents a weighty link
in the chain of student government; it has a reciprocal responsi
bility of delivering ideas and producing them.
To Conference come the suggestions of the Administration
for activities and conduct; to Conference also should come the
suggestions of the women students in these same matters, and
further suggestions of the women as formulated through thought
ful and active discussion in house meetings.
Discouraged house presidents can all too easily recognize
in their groups some students who will not be interested in
listening nor contributing, simply from the force of their own
habits. It is none the less their responsibility to actually com
municate the news of activities and proposals ip a way as nearly
as possible attractive to those who are chronically inactive, and
to encourage discussion from them.
Any deficiencies in leadership are therefore not to be laid
entirely to the house presidents. But these women are to be
blamed if their attitude is that the present situation is a hopeless
one, and one that is inevitable as proved by its long duration.
Our suggestions for improvement are largely subjective:
lengthen the house meeting if it is necessary in making them
more effective; try something out of the groove in method of
presentation, even if it borders on the absurd. Call on students
for opinions, ask different members to make reports instead of
having one person read all the announcements. Certainly there
are numerous ways to attract women to attend, and as many to
guarantee their attention once they are present. If the informa
tion has been communicated, and some opinions, however un
satisfactory to the president, garnered from the group, her re
sponsibility is at least nominally fulfilled. A minimum of six
