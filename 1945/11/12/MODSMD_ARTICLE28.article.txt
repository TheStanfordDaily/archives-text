# BULL SESSION

What happened to that supposedly high-powered clean-up
campaign of Excom's? Remember, it started this quarter with
the ruling that there must be a light functioning at any fireside,
so that the patrons and patronesses can see what they're eating.
But this place still needs scrubbing. It really doesn't matter
whether or not the patrons get a chance to look at the food—in
fact, they'd bo so much happier if they could just gulp blindly.
Cne thing that's corrupt about this place is the space. Yes, the
Form, the atmosphere--in the dark.
The Registrar's propaganda pamphlets didn't explain what
that space felt like, when it was too dark to see. Maybe they
could have described it, by juggling the words in Dante's "In
ferno":
"And at a spot ten yards from the light in the tower, there
were those people held in bonds by entanglements of rose

bushes, having enough light to see that they were caught, but
not enough to free themselves.
"On the next level several hundred yards from the one light
—lie the prostrate forms of night bike riders, wounded and un
able to see what had stopped their flight. They groan and feel
the gravel around them, hear people passing, and smell that
the things they're lying in could be nothing less vile than gera
niums, but they can see nothing.
"And on the most distant brim of you know where, flounder
those drenched souls, who wandered completely beyond the
range of the light in the tower into the region of the libe foun
tain. Their muscles become weary from treading water, and they
are too weak to call for help. Theirs is a night void of light, and
filled with terrors spaced at 40 seconds, when the upper tier
of the fountain overflows and temporarily strangles them.
"And all is dark."
The administration has made feeble attempts to justify this
inadequate lighting system in three ways—financially, morally,
and in regards to tradition.
Financially, they claim that it costs less to furnish the Health
Service with gallons of purple, all-purpose fixing fluid, than it
would cost to dig holes for the burying of electric poles. Silly
people! Suppose they've never heard of paper lanterns being
strung from tree to tree.
Their moral justification is even weaker. "If it's too dark to
see outside, you won't be tempted to wander around to all those
nasty places on the highway," they say. But, suhs, have you
never heard of the libe's being open until 10 every night?
The last justification—tradition—has been developed to work
on the soft, loyal side of the student. "The hello spirit," reminds
the administration. Just because some faculty member once
collided with someone in the dark and found in the light of the
Paly Hospital operating room that the other victim was an old
friend he hadn't seen for three guarters, and they had more fun
in the hospital, talking over old times, etc., etc.
Well, somehow there just seem to be simpler ways of trick
ing old friends into realizing that you still exist. The telephone
and postal service—and light—don't have the musty touch of
tradition, but there's something so darned efficient and harmless
in them.
