CORRECTION
Dear Editor:
We feel that a restatement or correction is due concerning
evidence leading to full and final apprehension of our campus
thief.
As erroneously reported, Mr. Gallaghar searched a Madison
Hall room and found evidence that committed our campus pil
ferer to the San Jose jail. However, the correct and pertinent
facts are these:
Joe Easterbrook, while sweeping his room, found concealed
under his rug a jeweled fraternity pin and a pair of black cuff
links. Bill Sutphen recognized the fraternity pin as possibly
belonging to Ralph Duniway, a Sigma Nu of V/ashington Hall.
Mr. Duniway was contacted by telephone, and upon his arrival
confirmed the pin to be his. Then and only then, did Mr. Galla
ghar burst upon the scene. The events that followed were as
stated.
We are not publicity hounds, but if a story is worth printing,
it is worth printing correctly.
Sincerely,
Wm. T. Sutphen

ATOM BOMB
Dear Editor:
FOR RENTâ€”Mine tunnel. Suitable for atomic bomb shelter.
Will furnish to suit occupant.
It is not claimed that the U.S. is unqualifiedly capable of dic
tating democracy to the rest of the world. Certainly U.S. history
demonstrates many instances where U.S. foreign policy has been
less than democratic. Yet compared with other powers of equal
stature the U.S. has exhibited more concern for the rights and
privileges of other peoples than has any other great power.
If in her future dealings with other peoples the U.S. keeps in
mind the freedom of peaceful opportunity that all men desire
and deserve she cannot err far in her attempt to lead the world
to peace.
History reflects that no lasting amalgamation of peoples was
ever brought about without the use of force. Most of these com
binations were effected by men seeking personal gain and glory.
But, however deplorable may have been the initial circumstances
of such unification, peoples were brought together and under
the necssity of a common corcion gradually learned to live
peacefully together.
The U.S. temporarily possesses the secret of the atom bomb,
a means of bringing the world together. If the U.S. does not take
advantage of this temporary opportunity, some other nation more
realistic than she surely will.
There is a force in human affairs that is stronger than the
desire to kill fellow men. That is the desire to rule fellow men.
For ample proof, see the nearest history book. The forms which
this desire to rule takes are both varied and interesting.
All this weeping and wailing that we now hear of the terrors
of atomic warfare will soon be as nothing. Wait until the many
rulers of petty bailiwicks realize that their "manifest destiny"
has all but slipped through their fingers.
Then there truly will be the beating of breasts and rolling
of drums, and in the far reaches of the northern sky where the
stars ever shine, parabolic arcs of fire will cross marking the
passage of slim, trim missiles.
But I don't care. I am half blind, half deaf, a good part of my
mind is gone (as you can see), and I also wear a nice, noisy
v/ooden leg. I think I'll sit this one out and write a handbook
on atomic physics. Oh, yes, we already put a deposit on thai
mine tunnel, and I must remember to put in an electronic filter
system in case that rumor about radioactive airborne particles
is true. Yours truiy,
Solomon Dublin
