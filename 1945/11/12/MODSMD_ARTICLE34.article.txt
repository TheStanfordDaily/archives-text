# ON THE DISCS
## 
### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Hip Herman Herd Hops
After such releases as "Apple
Honey," "Caldonia," ''Northwest
Passage," "Goosey Gander," and
"Bijou," musicians and critics alike
were of the opinion that the utmost
in jazz had been achieved by the
band of the year, Woody Herman.
Then — "Your Father's Mustache"!
This is an amazing disc that is ex
citing enough to cause the most avid
Sammy Kaye fan to beat his head
against the wall in ecstasy. Featur
ing all the great sidemen that Wood
row has assembled in his band, this
platter succeeds in keeping the lis
tener, who is always wondering
what will come next, glued to his
phonograph for the entire .three
minutes of mad music.
From Ralph Burns' piano intro
to Dave Tough's driving coda, the
soloists and the ensemble proceed
to cut sonic of the greatest music
on wax. Bill Harris' siiphorn
chorus, Flip Phillips' tenor, and
Marjorie Hyam's vibe solo are all
so wonderful that a choice as to
the best is very difficult. The
brass unison lead by Pete Can
doli is so precise, intricate, and
fresh (hat it makes one wonder
just how far music can progress.
The reverse, "Gee, It's Good to
Hold You," is an Ellington-like ar
rangement with a beautiful vocal
by Frances Wayne. With Herman
taking the opening chorus on alto,
Phillip's sax rounds out the num
ber after the vocal.
Be sure to catch Frances' phras
ing on the words, "like you did it
before," with the complete band
coming in on the upbeat. It is only
more proof that no matter what
mood is desired, commercialism can
be done away with and good music
supplanted in its place. Records
such as this come few and far be
tween.
Benny's Got Rhythm
It seems as if praise is in order

this week as we now applaud the
Benny Goodman Sextet. In his first
twelve-inch disc in years, Benny
has produced another record that
only makes his title of "King of
Swing" more impressive. The side
of interest is a wonderful rendition
of the Gershwin tune, "I Got
Rhythm." With Mel Powell sitting
in on piano, the featured soloists go
through the platter at such an amaz
ing tempo that the opinion that mu
sic is destroyed at too fast a pace
becomes a fallacy.
Red Norvo's performance on
vibes helps reaffirm our belief
(hat he is superior to "Pops"
Hampton on this instrument, and
the bow-master, Slam Stewart,
goes through such a great chorus
that you begin to wonder if he
isn't sawing his bass in half. The
fine lower-register work by the
King himself and the mad rifling
on (he last chorus are enough in
i (hemsclves to make this record a
best seller. Although Powell
; sounds like everyone but him
self (especially Teddy Wilson),
his appearance with his old boss
is a reassurance that Mel will
continue to play ja/.z instead of
| switching to (he classics as was
rumored.
The other side is simply a reissue
I of the old Goodman version of "The
Man I Love" which features Helen
i Forrest on the vocal. The return of
| this disc was naturally brought on
! by the Gershwin boom, and perhaps
| the most redeeming quality of the
i record is the appearance of Cootie
j Williams on trumpet.
Lombardo Feeds Family
| Versatile Guy Lombardo (he can
| play anything from bad to terrible)
has released another record on the
Decca label. Guy, who employs in
his organization five or six other
j Lombardos, has cut two sides in the
j Latin-American vein, "Jose Gonza
les" and "No Can Do." Although
jit will offer little competition to
I Xiivier Cugat, this is the type of
I music the Royal Canadians should
! use more often as it is very easy to
play without having good musicians
in the band.
"Jose Gonzales" features Don
Rodney on (he vocal. Rodney has
(»ne pnin( in his favor in (ba( he
is better than Carmen Lombardo.
This is not saying mu<4i for him,
as Carmen is one of the worst
vocalists in Swingdom, but i( does
show (bat the record could be
worse. The reverse, "No Can Do,"
has Rodney again on vocal sup
ported by Rose Marie Lombardo
(surprise!). Rose Marie breaks
the old Lombardo tradition as you
can listen to her without think
ing you need a new needle.
There are many reasons why
Guy. his family, and his friends are
as bad as they are. One of these
is the utilizing of a heavy vibrato
in the sax section, and another is
the presence of a tuba in the band.
Needless to say. these two sides will
j add nothing to Pan-American rela
-1 tions. We can only hope that it does
j not cause an international crisis.
