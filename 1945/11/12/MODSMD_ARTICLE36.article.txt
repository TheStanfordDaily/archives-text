# U.S.-German Policy Inconsistent:' Spalding
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
After spending six months in Eu
rope collecting material for the Hoo
ver War Library, Merrill Spalding,
research associate, and associate pro
fessor of history, who returned to
Stanford this summer, is convinced
that the United States is dodging the
issue of rehabilitating Germany.
"We are failing to send over
enough men who speak German,
know the German people and their
history and can help them build a
liberal government, which is the
most important thing of all."
Mr. Spalding believes that we
made a mistake in 1918-19 in being
inconsistent in our dealing with the
defeated country and that it may be
repeated. "After the last war there
was much talk about minorities get
ting freedom, but eventually the
victors got the territory for "strate
gic frontiers as in the Tyrol and
Bohemia."
"And then the Allies proposed
harsh terms, such as the 'guilt
clause' which infuriated the Ger
mans, and then did not enforce
them. The inconsistency' of this
policy gave the Germans courage
to defy the Versailles Treaty when
Hitler came to power."
Right now it is a question of in
consistency of attitude, he stated.
Officially, the American forces of
occupation maintain a very rigid
policy toward the Germans, but this
cannot actually be maintained be
cause the individual relationships
are bound to b? friendly. This was,
he said, realized even while the non
fraternization policy was in effect.
A growing friendly attitude be
tween Americans and Germans and
the rapid loss of hatred between
Germany and her other enemies, as
was experienced after World War I,
will lead, he believes, to the repeti
tion of a mistake made after that
war, if we continue to profess a pol
icy of harsh retaliation. The Ger
mans will not know what to expect,
if we say one thing and then do an
other.
If we are going to have a strict
policy it should be strictly en
forced. otherwise we should come
right out and say that we want to
help Germany rebuild her govern
ment. and then do so to the best

of our ability, which does not
mean doing it for lu-r. lit* contin
ued.
In answer to the question of
whether he believes the Germans as
a people can ever achieve anything
approaching a democratic govern
ment, Mr. Spalding stated that a
nation which produced such a phi
losopher as Kant and an individual
istic poet as Goethe cannot be la
beled as hopeless. That they are in
clined to accept more readily an au
thoritarian government does not
mean that they are also inclined to
niliatrism.
Some people today think that
fanatic nationalism is inevitable.
Mr. Spalding believes that a long
view of history will show that this
is not so. In his opinion we have
no justification to assume that the
high wave of nationalism will con
tinue indefinitely. Still we should
not count too much on its calming
down, but do our best to prevent
friction between Germany and her
neighbors.
This brings in the difficult prob
lem of disputed territories such as
Alsace-Lorraine and Danzig which
Mr. Spalding believes should be
made international zones in which
the Germans are permitted an equal
share of authority.
While in France Mr. Spalding said
he noticed that among Frenchmen
previous to the recent elections there
was a great fear of Communism tak
ing over in that country. A similar
fear that Germany will go commu
nist he believes is unfounded chief
ly because they have a middle class
psychology, and they like their prop
erty to be their own.
In comparing today's situation
with that after World War I, be
said that communism failed to
take over in 1918 at a time when
the nation was certainly most ripe
for revolution and the setting up
of an extreme socialistic govern
ment.
Mr. Spalding was in Aachen al
most immediately after the Ameri
can army had taken the city, collect
ing books, pamphlets, newspapers
and various sorts of propaganda. In
examining some of the books in the
shops he admits being surprised by
the venemous attacks upon the
United States and American leaders
made in books which had not yet
been removed.
"It will be a tremendous job weed
ing out the literature which the
Germans are to read for some time
to come and this too will take men
who know the language, the country
and the people."

was experienced after World War I,
will lead, he believes, to the repeti
tion of a mistake made after that
war, if we continue to profess a pol
icy of harsh retaliation. The Ger
mans will not know what to expect,
if we say one thing and then do an
other.
If we are going to have a strict
policy it should be strictly en
forced. otherwise we should come
right out and say that we want to
help Germany rebuild her govern
ment. and then do so to the best

of our ability, which does not
mean doing it for lu-r. lit* contin
ued.
In answer to the question of
whether he believes the Germans as
a people can ever achieve anything
approaching a democratic govern
ment, Mr. Spalding stated that a
nation which produced such a phi
losopher as Kant and an individual
istic poet as Goethe cannot be la
beled as hopeless. That they are in
clined to accept more readily an au
thoritarian government does not
mean that they are also inclined to
niliatrism.
Some people today think that
fanatic nationalism is inevitable.
Mr. Spalding believes that a long
view of history will show that this
is not so. In his opinion we have
no justification to assume that the
high wave of nationalism will con
tinue indefinitely. Still we should
not count too much on its calming
down, but do our best to prevent
friction between Germany and her
neighbors.
This brings in the difficult prob
lem of disputed territories such as
Alsace-Lorraine and Danzig which
Mr. Spalding believes should be
made international zones in which
the Germans are permitted an equal
share of authority.
While in France Mr. Spalding said
he noticed that among Frenchmen
previous to the recent elections there
was a great fear of Communism tak
ing over in that country. A similar
fear that Germany will go commu
nist he believes is unfounded chief
ly because they have a middle class
psychology, and they like their prop
erty to be their own.
In comparing today's situation
with that after World War I, be
said that communism failed to
take over in 1918 at a time when
the nation was certainly most ripe
for revolution and the setting up
of an extreme socialistic govern
ment.
Mr. Spalding was in Aachen al
most immediately after the Ameri
can army had taken the city, collect
ing books, pamphlets, newspapers
and various sorts of propaganda. In
examining some of the books in the
shops he admits being surprised by
the venemous attacks upon the
United States and American leaders
made in books which had not yet
been removed.
"It will be a tremendous job weed
ing out the literature which the
Germans are to read for some time
to come and this too will take men
who know the language, the country
and the people."
After spending six months in Eu
rope collecting material for the Hoo
ver War Library, Merrill Spalding,
research associate, and associate pro
fessor of history, who returned to
Stanford this summer, is convinced
that the United States is dodging the
issue of rehabilitating Germany.
"We are failing to send over
enough men who speak German,
know the German people and their
history and can help them build a
liberal government, which is the
most important thing of all."
Mr. Spalding believes that we
made a mistake in 1918-19 in being
inconsistent in our dealing with the
defeated country and that it may be
repeated. "After the last war there
was much talk about minorities get
ting freedom, but eventually the
victors got the territory for "strate
gic frontiers as in the Tyrol and
Bohemia."
"And then the Allies proposed
harsh terms, such as the 'guilt
clause' which infuriated the Ger
mans, and then did not enforce
them. The inconsistency' of this
policy gave the Germans courage
to defy the Versailles Treaty when
Hitler came to power."
Right now it is a question of in
consistency of attitude, he stated.
Officially, the American forces of
occupation maintain a very rigid
policy toward the Germans, but this
cannot actually be maintained be
cause the individual relationships
are bound to b? friendly. This was,
he said, realized even while the non
fraternization policy was in effect.
A growing friendly attitude be
tween Americans and Germans and
the rapid loss of hatred between
Germany and her other enemies, as
was experienced after World War I,
will lead, he believes, to the repeti

While in France Mr. Spalding said

previous to the recent elections there

fear that Germany will go commu

psychology, and they like their prop

In comparing today's situation

Mr. Spalding was in Aachen al
most immediately after the Ameri

and various sorts of propaganda. In
examining some of the books in the
shops he admits being surprised by
the venemous attacks upon the
United States and American leaders
made in books which had not yet
been removed.
"It will be a tremendous job weed
ing out the literature which the
Germans are to read for some time
to come and this too will take men
who know the language, the country
and the people."
After spending six months in Eu
rope collecting material for the Hoo
ver War Library, Merrill Spalding,
research associate, and associate pro
fessor of history, who returned to
Stanford this summer, is convinced
that the United States is dodging the
issue of rehabilitating Germany.
"We are failing to send over
enough men who speak German,
know the German people and their
history and can help them build a
liberal government, which is the
most important thing of all."
Mr. Spalding believes that we
made a mistake in 1918-19 in being
inconsistent in our dealing with the
defeated country and that it may be
repeated. "After the last war there
was much talk about minorities get
ting freedom, but eventually the
victors got the territory for "strate
gic frontiers as in the Tyrol and
Bohemia."
"And then the Allies proposed
harsh terms, such as the 'guilt
clause' which infuriated the Ger
mans, and then did not enforce
them. The inconsistency' of this
policy gave the Germans courage
to defy the Versailles Treaty when
Hitler came to power."
Right now it is a question of in
consistency of attitude, he stated.
Officially, the American forces of
occupation maintain a very rigid
policy toward the Germans, but this
cannot actually be maintained be
cause the individual relationships
are bound to b? friendly. This was,
he said, realized even while the non
fraternization policy was in effect.
A growing friendly attitude be
tween Americans and Germans and
the rapid loss of hatred between
Germany and her other enemies, as
was experienced after World War I,
will lead, he believes, to the repeti
tion of a mistake made after that
war, if we continue to profess a pol
icy of harsh retaliation. The Ger
mans will not know what to expect,
if we say one thing and then do an
other.
If we are going to have a strict
policy it should be strictly en
forced. otherwise we should come
right out and say that we want to
help Germany rebuild her govern
ment. and then do so to the best

of our ability, which does not
mean doing it for lu-r. lit* contin
ued.
In answer to the question of
whether he believes the Germans as
a people can ever achieve anything
approaching a democratic govern
ment, Mr. Spalding stated that a
nation which produced such a phi
losopher as Kant and an individual
istic poet as Goethe cannot be la
beled as hopeless. That they are in
clined to accept more readily an au
thoritarian government does not
mean that they are also inclined to
niliatrism.
Some people today think that
fanatic nationalism is inevitable.
Mr. Spalding believes that a long
view of history will show that this
is not so. In his opinion we have
no justification to assume that the
high wave of nationalism will con
tinue indefinitely. Still we should
not count too much on its calming
down, but do our best to prevent
friction between Germany and her
neighbors.
This brings in the difficult prob
lem of disputed territories such as
Alsace-Lorraine and Danzig which
Mr. Spalding believes should be
made international zones in which
the Germans are permitted an equal
share of authority.
