# Pigskin Enthusiasm Booms for Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's mystery team—the one nobody seems to know anything
about—will trot out onto the stadium turf Saturday to play the formidable
Stockton Air Base.
While estimates of the possible crowd in attendance vary, it is expected
that the game will attract from S,(MX) to 20,000 Bay Area fans.

I will be out in pre-war style for the
game. Rally Committee is trying to
get (he rooters as well co-ordinated
as they were in previous years for
their songs and yells.
Stanford's abbreviated schedule
has been narrowed down to two
I games—one against Stockton Sat
i urday and another game against
! (be San Mateo Merchant Marine
on Dec. 1.
The game Saturday will be the
first game for the Indians since 1942.
The Indians ended the '42 season
with a rosy tint when they defeated
Oregon State, California, and St.
Mary's Pre - Flight on successive
week-ends.
Enthusiasm for football all over
the country is high as can be evi
denced by large attendances in
! various sectors of the country. For
California's opening game against
St. Mary's, 80,000 fans jammed
' into Memorial Stadium. A week
later 00,000 saw St. Mary's play
little Nevada. In former times
this game wouldn't have drawn
15.000 fans.
What can be expected of the In
dian team in Saturday's game is
unknown. What Schwartz might
have up his sleeve is anybody's
guess. The Stockton team is one of
the stronger service teams on the
West Coast and walloped McClel
land Field 20-0 earlier in the sea
son.
