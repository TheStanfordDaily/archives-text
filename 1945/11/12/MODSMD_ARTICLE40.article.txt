Who is going to play in the Rose
I Bowl? To use the trite expression,
j that is the $64 question. Our beloved
comrades to the north, the Univer
sity ol Washington, were expected
to be the West Coast ambassador of
football come (he first day of the
new year, but what happens? A
stubborn Oregon Slate gang went up
to Seattle the day before yesterday
and dumped the proud Huskies, 7-6.
That, for the present, knocks the
i Pasadena hopes of Washington. In
| all probability, the squad can go
skiing on Mt. Rainier during Christ
mas vacation, and they will be
J missed by no one.
USC, which was the pre-season
lavorite to go Arroyo Seco way,
now again bobs up as th 6 candidate
for the Tournament of Roses. They
have been trounced three times al
ready this season, but only once
where it really counts. The gobs of
"Diego" and the Herman Weder
meyer powerhouse of Morgan both i
pulled the once proud Trojan, but ■
those games were outside league !
competition, and when the represen- j
tatives of each school in the PCC
vote for their choice as delegate to j
the Rose Bowl, they will conven
iently forget those two defeats.
But USC's cross-town rivals, !
UCLA, can't be entirely overlooked
for the Rose Bowl candidates. They
have only suffered one league loss,
and that was their first encounter
of the season against USC. Since
then they have whipped Oregon and
California. They run against South
ern California once more, and the
possibility of a victory wouldn't be
outside the realm of possibility. Es
pecially not (his year. Maybe the
proud and vicious Aztecs of San
Diego State could beat USC this
year. Quicn sabe.
Washington State is pretty well
out of the running, even though they
upset Oregon on Saturday. They
have been a "hot and cold" team this
year, one week the barometer's up,
and the next week it's down. Next
week the reading should go down.
The rest of the teams are scram
bling around for a high place in
the second, and it's anybody's guoss
on the outcome. A good bet is Idaho.
In this year of upsets galore. Idaho
might even play in the Rose Bowl.
Now wouldn't that be one honey of
a game—Army versus Idaho? Who
said a team couldn't score 200 points
in one game. As for us, we would
like to see Adolphus Menixus play
Alma in the game of games, the Rose
Bowl. A rip-snorter that would be.
We Challenge
Now for the news of the day, of
the year, and of the century. The
Daily herewith, and without hesi
tation, challengfe our ancient ri
vals, Chappie to a gridiron titanic.
Marquis of Queensberry rules
must be observed, and the Chap
pie is invited to send a delegate to
the sanctified shelter of the Shack
for a conference this afternoon at
.'1:15 for a parley on game eligibil
ity, time, and ail the particulars.
