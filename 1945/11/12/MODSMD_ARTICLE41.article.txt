# '37 Grid Team Betters Mediocre Record '36
## 
### STU MILLAR 
(This is another in a series of
stories about Stanford gridiron his
tory. Ed. Note).

With eight of iiis first stringers
returning to the fold, Coach Tiny
, Thornhill faced a more successful
I season in 1937. Pete Zagar, strong
j tackle, was b'"ing boomed for All -
[ American honors. Bill Paulman was
| counted on for tremendous aid after
i being sidelined with injuries for a
| year. Jimmy Coffis, little Jim, was
I back once more to squeeze his way
I through opposing lines.
Jack Clark and Grant Stone, two
I fast flankers, were back on the Farm
j to anchor down what looked like a
j first-rate line. Tony Calvelli, who
; played in the backfield in '36 because
lof the shortage of experienced
j glory-boys, was back once more at
j his favorite position, center. Thorn
hill was looking forward toward th'.'
season. He was determined to give
the other Conference teams a run
j '.'or iheir money.
The first game this year was again
! with Santa Clara. Last year, after
I convincingly beating the Indian foot
ballers, the Broncs had gone on the
! Sugar Bowl fame and this year they
| were out to keep the same pattern
I unbroken. And they succeeded. Buck
i Shaw's boys got the same 13 points
they had made before, but Stanford
could only improve 7 over the zero
they had before.
It wasn't till ihe last four minutes
that the Card goose-egg was re
placed. Two pass plays that netted
100 yards accounted for the score.
The locals gained exactly 20 yards
all day on running plays.
Lost io Oregon
The picture grew brighter and
j darker at the same time next week.
Oregon defeated Stanford, 7 to G,
! the first time in history they ever
won over the Cardinals in the grid
iron sport. But the Farm team as a
whole showed definite improvement
in all departments. Statistics were
overwhelmingly in favor of Stanford
as Coffis and team scored 19 first
downs to the Webfeet's 8.
When U.C.L.A. swamped the same
northerners by a big margin, even
loyal Indians had a hard time figur
ing a win for Thornhill against the
Bruins. But the Los Angeles boys
were surprised as was the whole
nation when they came out on the
short end of a 12 to 7 score. It was a

complete transformation as far as
the Stanford team was concerned.
Pete Fay and Fred Lebedoer ran
wild. U.C.L.A. only managed to
break the ice in the last minute of
the game when Hirshon ran 95 yards
with an intercepted pass for their
only touchdown.
Grant Stone took a pass to the 13
and Groves ran the ball over for the
first Stanford score and Lebedoer
and Fay alternated in a 65-yard
drive for the second.
Still hot from their triumph over
the southerners, the Card footballers
went up to Washington and cashed
in on enough breaks to take the
Huskies into camp 13 to 7.
Grant Stone covered a blocked
kick for the first t.d. and Groves ran
j 17 yards for the last one. Dcfensive
! ly the team was hot that day as
j Stone, Willard and Zagar made
clean, hard tackles all over the field,
lied O.S.C.
As it goes with the Air Force, the
| only thing that could then stop the
I Cards was the weather. And it did.
|O.S. C. considered itself fortunate
I when the 0-0 score was recorded.

The rain-soaked field proved too
| slippery for Fay and Lebedoer, and
| the slimy ball prohibited any pass
j ng.
Even so, the Stanford team would
I have won if it had not been for pen
alties at crucial moments.
Stop Amby Schindler was the slo
gan of the team next week. For the
first few minutes tiie U.S.C. made
Card rooters eat their words, but
the Indians didn't give up.
TJhey held the All-American to
on? touchdown which he scored
from the one and then proceeded to
come back in the second half to win
the ball game by one point. A pass
from Groves to Fay, play,
tied the game, and Luckett booted
the winning point. But if you were
to ask any coach or player except
Paulman himself, you would have
been told that hard-luck Bill's long
punts were the one thing that saved
the game for Stanford.
They were hot again and they
knew it. They rolled through Wash
ington State College by a score of
23 to 0. Fay, Stone, Paulman and
Coffis scored that day. Pete ran 13
yards to pay dirt. Zagar blocked a
kick. Stone, who was captain that
qlay. fell on it, Paulman. booted a
field goal from the 31, and Coffis
streaked 07 yards for the final
crusher.
Stanford was confident, but so was
Cal. As the big game approached,
both coaches admitted it would be
a tough game. But both felt that they
wouid win.
Well, the difference that day was
one Vic Bottari and exactly eight
minutes of sensational California
play. The 13 to 0 score did not tell
th r> story of the close game. It was
even all the way except for those
fateful eight minutes. During that
time, every Cal players executed his
blocking assignments perfetcly and
' Bottari came through.
Paulman played great
As far as Stanford was concerned.
Bill Paulman was its outstanding
player with Tony Calvelli close be
hind. Both played beautiful ball.
Two hours after the defeat, the
team was on its way east to meet
Columbia and Sid Luckman. But the
| let-down of the Big Game was too
much and a spirit-lacking Stanford
team came west with another 0-0 tie.
Only resemblance to the team of
old was provided by Pete Fay who
ran for a touchdown only to have it
called back.
