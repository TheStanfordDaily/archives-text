# Hashers Crush Encina Team
## 
### 
The Kappa-Dee Gee Hashers con
tinued on their way to the Stanford
intramural football championship by
swamping the hard-fighting Encina
II team 2(! to G last Friday on Harry
Maloney Field.
Starting right off with a bang and
a touchdown, the Hashers compiled
every one of their counters in the
first half, and then coasted through
the second half to win easily.
Joe Sher, Ric Suppl?, Curt Burks,
Bob Rosburg, Willie Davies and
Denny Fox were just too much for
th e outclassed freshmen. They
passed all over the lot to razzle
dazzle their way to touchdown after
touchdown in the first few minutes.
Bill Lundquist, Dave Wheeler, Ed
Lefcourt. Ray Winterhalter, A 1 Ran
and Galen Fishbach. who scored the
touchdown, played nice games for
Encina.
