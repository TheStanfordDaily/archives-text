# Top Heavy 'Tavern' Detriment To Duffy
## 
### 
Paly High loved "Duffy's Tavern,"
now at the Stanford. Three-quar
ters of the student body laughed so
hard that the punch lines commit
ted hara-kiri in the aisles. Of course
there were two people who tried to
follow suit, but the ushers took care
of them.
Appreciation of "Duffy's Tavern,"
the film, probably depends upon
your opinion of "Duffy's Tavern,"
the radio show. Of course you have
to look at the people in the movie.
Ed Gardner (before the show
began, the producers took the
precaution of promising he was
the "one and only 'Archie'") went
through his typical routines in
workmanlike fashion. He did a
good job of it. if his halting "per
sonal maggotism" appeals to you.
In an effort to appease movie
goers for the "Duffy's" group, the
director threw practically every
other star on the iot into the pot.
Even Bing Crosby, Dorothy Lamour,
Sonny Tufts, Paulette Goddard,
Brian Donlevy, Eddie Bracken, Ver
onica Lake, and Alan Ladd couldn't
seem to pull the thing, out of a
crash dive.
The plot, built to support Archie
and um-teen other stars, was stag
gering by the last reel. Archie
kind-hearted as usual, is feeding 14
returned veterans who nave no jobs
because the record factory folded
with the war. That, in itself, was
enough.
In order to put the factory on
its feet again, they decided to hold
a "block benefit" to raise money.
Naturally the show was an amaz
ing success, naturally they fi
nally got the factory operating.
Of course they never quite ex
plained why the men, living in
, —

J
\ New York, didn't go into another
kind of work.
The scene that seemed to ap
peal most to the Sunday afternoon
audience was one in which Archie
and Mr. O'Malley are investigating
the refrigerator. Archie doesn't be
lieve that the light goes out when
the door is closed. Finally O'Malley
crawls in, and reports that his
glasses fog up so much that he
can't see.
Archie, of course, then volun
teers to investigate. While he is
in the refrigerator, O'Malley gels
sidetracked, and finds Archie stilT
with cold. . . . Well, they liked it!
George White's "Scandals" was
|.the double bill with "Duffy's." A

series of statuesque blondes and
da nee sequenees, Joan Davis and
Jack Haley were fighting gigantic
odds. Also on their side was Gene
Krupa.
Davis and Haley's "Who Killed
Vaudeville." routine was elever, but
the rest of the show made the an
swer too obvious. But let us not
continue this negative attitude.—
