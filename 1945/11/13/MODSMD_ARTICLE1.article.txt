# Campus To Meet Big Red Machine
## Jazz Band Will Lead Indian Parade From Top Of Row To Pavilion Rally 
### 
Originality, spontaneous enthusiasm, and two thundering bands will
be the keynotes of Thursday night's "Big Indian Rally," which precedes
Saturday's game with the Stockton Commandos. Two songs written in
honor of the Farm by a Stanford student, Betty Stellar of Union, have
been adapted for their first all-campus presentation at the rally.

One of the songs, "The Return of
the Stanford Rough," which is dedi
cated to veterans, will be sung by
Jack Taylor. A trio consisting of
Marky Cleek, Guyla Runyan, and
Joan Bailey will present the other
original song, "Stanford Girls Arc
Easy to Love."
Yell Leaders Introduced
Although Newt Arnold, the head
cheer leader, is well known to most
of the campus, his assistants, Bill
Lippincott and Charles Jackman,
have not yet been introduced to the
student body. Students will meet
these new yell leaders when they
start, the rally with a cheer which,
they hope, will surpass any yell yet
given in the Pavilion.
A torch-light procession, the first
seen on the campus in over two
years, will start at Buchanan Hall
at 7 o'clock Thursday night. The
spirited jazz band of "Mad Ben" Bok
will be mounted on a truck and will
lead the parade on the march to the
Pavilion.
Parade Will Pause
At the post office, the procession
will stop while members of Rally
Com, armed with torches, escort
Roble, Lagunita, and Ventura resi
dents to the parade. From there the
line of torches, students, and music
will proceed to the far side of En
cina to gather the residents of
Toyon, Branner, and Encina. Army
and Navy students are especially
invited to join in Stanford's first
post-war football rally.
Once at the Pavilion, the regular
Stanford band will start the rally
rolling toward the colorful enter
tainment which has been promised.
This rally will be the start of a post
war Farm, complete with a new
Cardinal team and a stronger unity
of spirit, state the rally's co-chair
men, Ruth Levison and Wally Mc-
Call.
Team Presented
Marchie Schwartz and his staff
will introduce the "Red Machine"
to the student body for the first
time. The entire team will be pre
sented as well as the starting lineup
for Saturday's game.
Rally Com members expect the
culmination of three years of a
teamless Stanford to appear in the
enthusiasm shown at the rally. They
emphasize the importance of back
ing the Red and White team.
Cow-bells Urged
Miss Levison and McCall urge
students to bring cow-bells and any
other rioise-making machines to the
rally. The more deafening the
racket, the better send-off the team
will receive, they state.
Rally Com members warn stu
dents that no one without a white
shirt or while sweater will be per
mitted to sit in the rooting section
at Saturday's game. They add that
no automobiles will be allowed in
the pre-rally procession Thursday
night. In order to make the rally a
success, there must be no danger of
accidents.

Rally Com members warn stu
dents that no one without a white
shirt or while sweater will be per
mitted to sit in the rooting section
at Saturday's game. They add that
no automobiles will be allowed in
the pre-rally procession Thursday
night. In order to make the rally a
success, there must be no danger of
accidents.

Originality, spontaneous enthusiasm, and two thundering bands will
be the keynotes of Thursday night's "Big Indian Rally," which precedes
Saturday's game with the Stockton Commandos. Two songs written in
honor of the Farm by a Stanford student, Betty Stellar of Union, have
been adapted for their first all-campus presentation at the rally.

One of the songs, "The Return of
the Stanford Rough," which is dedi
cated to veterans, will be sung by
Jack Taylor. A trio consisting of
Marky Cleek, Guyla Runyan, and
Joan Bailey will present the other
original song, "Stanford Girls Arc
Easy to Love."
Yell Leaders Introduced
Although Newt Arnold, the head
cheer leader, is well known to most
of the campus, his assistants, Bill
Lippincott and Charles Jackman,
have not yet been introduced to the
student body. Students will meet
these new yell leaders when they
start, the rally with a cheer which,
they hope, will surpass any yell yet
given in the Pavilion.
A torch-light procession, the first
seen on the campus in over two
years, will start at Buchanan Hall
at 7 o'clock Thursday night. The
spirited jazz band of "Mad Ben" Bok
will be mounted on a truck and will
lead the parade on the march to the
Pavilion.
Parade Will Pause
At the post office, the procession
will stop while members of Rally
Com, armed with torches, escort
Roble, Lagunita, and Ventura resi
dents to the parade. From there the
line of torches, students, and music
will proceed to the far side of En
cina to gather the residents of
Toyon, Branner, and Encina. Army
and Navy students are especially
invited to join in Stanford's first
post-war football rally.
Once at the Pavilion, the regular
Stanford band will start the rally
rolling toward the colorful enter
tainment which has been promised.
This rally will be the start of a post
war Farm, complete with a new
Cardinal team and a stronger unity
of spirit, state the rally's co-chair
men, Ruth Levison and Wally Mc-
Call.
Team Presented
Marchie Schwartz and his staff
will introduce the "Red Machine"
to the student body for the first
time. The entire team will be pre
sented as well as the starting lineup
for Saturday's game.
Rally Com members expect the
culmination of three years of a
teamless Stanford to appear in the
enthusiasm shown at the rally. They
emphasize the importance of back
ing the Red and White team.
Cow-bells Urged
Miss Levison and McCall urge
students to bring cow-bells and any
other rioise-making machines to the
rally. The more deafening the
racket, the better send-off the team
will receive, they state.
