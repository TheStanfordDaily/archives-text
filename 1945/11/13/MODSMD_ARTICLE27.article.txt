Men: Have a Look

Inter-Hall Council — comparable to Row Ex
com for the women—proved a dismal failure
last year. Men's halls still lack representation
of any sort. Only half-hearted attempt is made
through weekly meetings of the resident as
sistants, employees of the University.
Here are some of the urgent problems now
facing men's halls: (1) proper representation
of th'jir ideas at Excom —Representative Frank
DeLislo has no'means of discovering problems
and wishes of individual halls unless he inter
views each president separately; (2) regulation
of guests and strangers entering the halls—
tightening up of policy needs enforceable
rules; (3) adoption of a standard system of
quiet hours, social regulations, liquor enforce
ment, and inter hall activities; (4) a better class
organization is needed - witness the 20 sopho
more men who attended the last meeting; (5)
the Daily's comment on lack of interest of each
hall in Quad pictures —this interest lack is ap
parent in other activities among men's halls.
Fraternities made it obligatory that their'rep
rescntatives attend meetings of the Inter-Fra
ternity Council. The Council is being reor
ganised shortly. If it is, Stanford's independent
men v/ill find themselves without any represen
tation—even more out in the cold as frater
nity men band together again. .
Our suggestion: that men's hall presidents
oi house managers meet weekly at 4:30 on
Wednesday. They will discuss their prob
lems by themselves, then at 5 will join with
the resident assistants in Dean Sharp's office
to talk over issues jointly.
Some real teeth are necessary to institute
such a measure immediately. It is against our
wishes that a men's Row organization originate
through University regulation. Rather, it should
come from the men themselves, who should
voluntarily send representatives to this week
ly meeting, fix penalties for members not at
tending.
An added thought: invite a representative
from the women's Row Excom to attend the
men's meeting, and vice versa.
If Stanford men want equal footing with co
eds in student government, social activities and
operation of their living groups, swift and de
cisive adoption of such a plan of weekly rep
resentation is essential.—Bill Eilers

of guests and strangers entering the halls—
tightening up of policy needs enforceable
rules; (3) adoption of a standard system of
quiet hours, social regulations, liquor enforce
ment, and inter hall activities; (4) a better class
organization is needed - witness the 20 sopho
more men who attended the last meeting; (5)
the Daily's comment on lack of interest of each
hall in Quad pictures —this interest lack is ap
parent in other activities among men's halls.
Fraternities made it obligatory that their'rep
rescntatives attend meetings of the Inter-Fra
ternity Council. The Council is being reor
ganised shortly. If it is, Stanford's independent
men v/ill find themselves without any represen
tation—even more out in the cold as frater
nity men band together again. .
Our suggestion: that men's hall presidents
oi house managers meet weekly at 4:30 on
Wednesday. They will discuss their prob
lems by themselves, then at 5 will join with
the resident assistants in Dean Sharp's office
to talk over issues jointly.
Some real teeth are necessary to institute
such a measure immediately. It is against our
wishes that a men's Row organization originate
through University regulation. Rather, it should
come from the men themselves, who should
voluntarily send representatives to this week
ly meeting, fix penalties for members not at
tending.
An added thought: invite a representative
from the women's Row Excom to attend the
men's meeting, and vice versa.
If Stanford men want equal footing with co
eds in student government, social activities and
operation of their living groups, swift and de
cisive adoption of such a plan of weekly rep
resentation is essential.—Bill Eilers
