### Stanley Wilson 
First-of-the-week congratulations go to Con
nie Johnston and Dede Bergerot for handling
the Eighth Victory Loan Drive with such suc
cess. Final figures on the $50,000 goal are not
complete, but it is guite certain that Stanford
hit the mark.
lanie Sontheimer, chairman of the bond auc
tion, and Don Bechter, auctioneer, should re
ceive a free beer or two for their efforts also.
It is reported that the Lucky Strike cigarette
manufacturers have forwarded some tempting
offers to Bechter for the exclusive use of his
voice and talent. We liked the manner in which
Stanford's Speed Riggs carried off the auction.
He bled the meager audience white. Bechter's
manner was so convincing that the attending
bidders were not content with buying bonds
alone. It resolved itself down to bidding for
some of Bechter's wearing apparel. I'm cer
tainly glad the boy is modest!
We received the asked-for anonymous letter
from the eager Indians who played havoc at
Cal the other week, and it clears up a lot of
diverse opinions. We heard it was Stanford
students who performed the deed; we heard it
was Paly High or Berkeley High, and we even
heard it was Cal Rally Com. But now it is
proved it was a group of Cardinals running
amuck.
It seems the fellows were a little hurt because
I referred to them as the "Immortal Eight."
'1 hey want to be dubbed the "Immoral Eight."
The conclusion of this department is that we
conserve such action and expend it on such
activities as fielding a decent set of athletic
teams. It is hardly fair for a non-playing foot
ball rival to be in possession of the Axe and
add coals to the fire by painting up another

party incapable of fighting back. There's my
verbal spanking for the week!
Most embarrassed girl of the quarter: The
most tremendous butch of ali time occurred at
the Lagunita Tea, honoring Dr. and Mrs. Stal
naker, last Sunday. One oc the awfully smooth
Lagunita hostesses was busy circulating
through the assembled crowd, purring very
diplomatic nothings to the celebrities at hand.
As she sat down at Dr. Eurich's table, she made
with the typical "So good to have you here"
talk. Then getting into the meat of the subject,
our little quick-witted hostess came out with,
"And what is your job at Stanford, Dr. Eurich?"
. . . Here's a personal tip to the hostess at
this point: They tell me University of Oregon
is just a top-flight college. Ah, but that's what
I like. People who aren't impressed by rank
or authority.

This seems to be a day of praise, so I can't
neglect the Chalet-Cubberley girls for the party
party-time dance as of last Saturday night.
Plenty of atmosphere, plenty of the metropoli
tan spirit, plenty of food and plenty of people.
The last is a certain indication of success.
