# Women Urge Importance Of Meetings
## 
### 
Subjects discussed at Women's
Conference yesterday were:
1. Leadership
2. Standards
Stressing that the house president
has about the most important job on
campus, Patty Patten, chairman of
Women's Conference, opened a dis
cussion on leadership and partici
pation and interest in house meet
ings.
"The basis of student government
is the individual student, Miss Pat
ten said, "and it is the house presi
dent's duty to represent the students
in her house, and thereby make
student government what it is."
O. D. Phillips, president of Lagu
nita, said that house meetings have
improved somewhat this year. She
also thought that meetings should be
held at the time that is most con
venient to the majority and that the
length of meetings has much to do
with interest.
Conference members agreed
that meetings should be primarily
devoted to the discussion of im
portant topics and should not be
just a place where announcements
arc given.
Topics may be introduced in such
a way that they will promote discus
sion. Many times one of the house
officers might present a negative
viewpoint so that the discussion will
be stimulated. It was also suggested
that referring subjects discussed at
Conference back to the house meet
ing stimulated interest.
House meetings arc compulsory
in the Row and Union Unit houses.
Conference members could not
decide whether or not they should
be compulsory all over campus.
Lagunita women were to be ap
proached on this question in their
housc meetings last night.
Other suggestions for improving
house meetings were to have house
officers besides the president pre
sent topics, and have the vice-presi
dent take over a meeting sometimes
while the president visits another
house meeting to get new ideas on
presentation.
Miss Patten announced that
women's standards arc still very
lax. It was suggested that this
subject be discussed more fully in
house meetings so that girls will
understand that certain standards
are necessary on campus to main
tain good taste.
The Social Regulations Commit
tee will meet this week and con
sider the possibility of having
houses remain open until 1:30 on
Friday and Saturday nights. Stu
dents have been complaining that
they have no place to go after 12.
