CONFERENCE "MILESTONE"
Washington's newest and perhaps most in
effectual debating society, the labor-manage
ment conference, has released its first victory
statement. "All working committees," the sec
retary said, "have accepted the principle of col
lective bargaining."
"Since this guestion broke up the last con
ference," most observers tack on, "the new one
has no doubt passed a milestone." Since col
lective bargaining has been on the Federal
statutes for some years now, this no doubt took
a great deal of compromise on all sides.
NEED
The need of the nation, which this confer
ence is supposed to fill, is for a sensible and
acceptable wage-price-profits policy. So far the
frankest suggestion has been contributed by
John L. Lewis, who proposes that "industry
have the right to make as much profit as it
can, and labor, to grab as big a share of it as
it can."
There is one thing certain, and that is that
this won't be the official statement of the con
ference. The reason is that it's too descriptive
of what is going on and what probably will con
tinue to go on.
SCENE TODAY
However, it certainly is descriptive of the
scene today. The most recent example of its
application is in the automobile industry,
where Mr. Walter Reuther, one of the leaders
of the CIO automotive workers, has been de
manding a 30 per cent wage increase from
General Motors.
General Motors finally countered with 10
per cent, in accordance with the government
estimate of the rise in the cost of living. Mr.
Reuther got rather vehement about this pro
posal, but in the many arguments he used
against it, he didn't include the obvious one
that anybody who has seen the inside of a
grocery store in recent years would have re
sorted to. That is that the government esti
mate is screwy. Anyway, he said something
about the management not entering collective
bargaining in good faith, and flew off to see
the union hierarchy about calling a strike.
THE FUTURE
It is highly possible that, under the present
tax laws, the big industrialists have made as
much money as they can for the year. Thus
their strategy might be to provoke strikes,
which they can sit out at no cost to themselves.
If they can hold out long enough, the unions
will run out of strike benefits and the strikers
will run out of patience.
However, if the unions can catch the big
operators just when they are retooling, and
can keep them from uniting on a consolidated
business policy, the labor agents will deal an
excellent strategic stroke through the strategy
of timing.
THE IDEAL
But, in this hopeless maze of dog-eat-dog,
there is still a possibility that too many people
v/on't lose sight of an ideal economic policy.
That would call for higher wages, but higher
wages financed through the productive ca
pacity of society.
If labor leaders and management would work
towards that end, and pool their statistics in
annual conferences to work things out on a
practical, year-to-year basis, things might be
settled. But, as things stand now, labor rela
tions are twofold. Part are industrialists who
want to make as much as possible, and part are
labor agents who want to get a lot of publicity
to convince "the boys" that there's really no
sense in hoilding another election. It seems the
only way these conflicting ends can be brought
together is through force, and the best and most
democratic force is the enlightened will of the
mass of the populace.

ence is supposed to fill, is for a sensible and
acceptable wage-price-profits policy. So far the
frankest suggestion has been contributed by
John L. Lewis, who proposes that "industry
have the right to make as much profit as it
can, and labor, to grab as big a share of it as
it can."
There is one thing certain, and that is that
this won't be the official statement of the con
ference. The reason is that it's too descriptive
of what is going on and what probably will con
tinue to go on.
SCENE TODAY
However, it certainly is descriptive of the
scene today. The most recent example of its
application is in the automobile industry,
where Mr. Walter Reuther, one of the leaders
of the CIO automotive workers, has been de
manding a 30 per cent wage increase from
General Motors.
General Motors finally countered with 10
per cent, in accordance with the government
estimate of the rise in the cost of living. Mr.
Reuther got rather vehement about this pro
posal, but in the many arguments he used
against it, he didn't include the obvious one
that anybody who has seen the inside of a
grocery store in recent years would have re
sorted to. That is that the government esti
mate is screwy. Anyway, he said something
about the management not entering collective
bargaining in good faith, and flew off to see
the union hierarchy about calling a strike.
THE FUTURE
It is highly possible that, under the present
tax laws, the big industrialists have made as
much money as they can for the year. Thus
their strategy might be to provoke strikes,
which they can sit out at no cost to themselves.
If they can hold out long enough, the unions
will run out of strike benefits and the strikers
will run out of patience.
However, if the unions can catch the big
operators just when they are retooling, and
can keep them from uniting on a consolidated
business policy, the labor agents will deal an
excellent strategic stroke through the strategy
of timing.
THE IDEAL
But, in this hopeless maze of dog-eat-dog,
there is still a possibility that too many people
v/on't lose sight of an ideal economic policy.
That would call for higher wages, but higher
wages financed through the productive ca
pacity of society.
If labor leaders and management would work
towards that end, and pool their statistics in
annual conferences to work things out on a
practical, year-to-year basis, things might be
settled. But, as things stand now, labor rela
tions are twofold. Part are industrialists who
want to make as much as possible, and part are
labor agents who want to get a lot of publicity
to convince "the boys" that there's really no
sense in hoilding another election. It seems the
only way these conflicting ends can be brought
together is through force, and the best and most
democratic force is the enlightened will of the
mass of the populace.
CONFERENCE "MILESTONE"
Washington's newest and perhaps most in
effectual debating society, the labor-manage
ment conference, has released its first victory
statement. "All working committees," the sec
retary said, "have accepted the principle of col
lective bargaining."
"Since this guestion broke up the last con
ference," most observers tack on, "the new one
has no doubt passed a milestone." Since col
lective bargaining has been on the Federal
statutes for some years now, this no doubt took
a great deal of compromise on all sides.
