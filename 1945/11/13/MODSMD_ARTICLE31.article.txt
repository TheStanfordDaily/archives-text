To the Editor:
Newspaper readers—even the ones who don't get beyond the
headlines—are beginning to realize that the Wonderful Postwar
World isn't living up to its glamorous publicity. With Indonese,
Chinese, and Annamites displaying unwarranted interest in the
four freedoms, with strikes covering the nation, with soldiers
growing increasingly disgusted about the slowness of their
return, and with the A-bomb hanging over us like Damocles'
sword, the typical reaction is to say that the world is in a hell
of a mess and let it go at that.

Labor problems have been shrouded in the usual confusion.
Presented to a wondering Mr. and Mrs. America are a multitude
of claims and opinions, but few facts. From the welter of claims
and counterclaims, editorials, speeches, debates, elections and
strikes it becomes clear that organized labor suffered two sig
nificant defeats during the past week.
In Detroit labor put up a good fight as United Automobile
Workers' Frankensteen failed to capture the mayoralty from
incumbent Jeffries.
In New York it put up no fight at all. Bill O'Dwyer, gang
buster, former brigadier general and Tammany machine poli
tician, was elected mayor of the world's biggest city without
much difficulty. He was supported by the CIO-PAC and the
American Labor party. It v/ould seem, therefore, that labor was
victorious. But they backed a man who has no outstanding
abilities, whose past record is far from inspiring, and who cer
tainly cannot be considered an outspoken friend of organized
labor.
Liberal forces are stronger in New York than in most cities.
In New York, if anywhere, a union-Labor party-supported can
didate has a chance to triumph over the political machines.
Organized labor has let the chance slip by.
A partial explanation of this may be found in New York
slate politics, with the city normally strongly Democratic and
upstate egually strongly Republican. Liberals, by allying them
selves with a powerful Democratic machine, hope to defeat
Dewey in the 1946 gubernatorial election. Thus by acguies
cing locally to a man not entirely to their liking they look for
ward to striking the Republican a telling blow.
The importance of New York in national politics lies in the
unusual number of presidential candidates from that state —A 1
Smith, Roosevelt and Dewey in recent years. Its size gives the
Empire State a decisive influence in nominating conventions —
its 47 electoral votes have given countless politicians sleepless
nights.
Presidential elections are a long way ahead and may hardly
seem worth worrying about now. However, the New York and
Detroit elections can be of value to us in our attempts to find
out what the relation between unions and politics is.
We see that organized labor has both a short- and a long-run
political program. Detroit exemplifies the former: labor battles
for immediate gains. New York shows labor looking far into
the future, playing ball with the major parties in the hope of
becoming a balance of power neither Republicans nor Democrats
will be able to ignore.

Statistics are very handy. With them you can "prove" that
wages are too high, too low, or just about right. Manipulated with
proper dexterity they can prove almost anything.
With these precautions here are some illuminating figures
on the wages the unions want raised. They have been released
by the Commerce Department by men who are not "reds," not
even "pinks," but who have been in the Department since the
clays of the oh-so-very-liberal Jesse Jones. Furthermore they
are based on production estimates that are considerably more
conservative than estimates by the industries themselves. For
fhis reason they are recommended for your consideration.
The figures indicate rather surprisingly that even with a
15 per cent wage increase now and another 10 per cent raise
in 1947, the automobile industry would make bigger profits
than in any peace-time year:
Profits in millions
Year of dollars after
taxes
1929 451
1940 390
1941 423
1946 360
1947 610
1948 670
Considering manufacturing industries as a whole, the Com
merce Department study points out that if wages are not raised,
the average in 1946 will be $33.96 as compared to $26.64 in
1941. However, the 1946 incomes will actually be worth 3 per
cent less in terms of purchasing power than incomes in 1941.
Furthermore, the Commerce Department maintains, even with
wage raises sufficient to maintain average hourly earnings at the
1945 level, profits minus taxes for 1946 are estimated at six
billion dollars, a figure higher than the war-time peak.
Before objecting vociferously to labor's "impertinent de
mands" let us try to get the facts.—George Brunn
