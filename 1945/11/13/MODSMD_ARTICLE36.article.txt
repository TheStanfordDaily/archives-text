# Biological Seminars Bring Top Scientists To Farm
## 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
The biological science depart
ment's weekly seminars try to bring
outstanding men to Stanford to
speak on all fields of biology and
medical problems of general inter
est.
About half of the speakers are
Stanford professors, who make re
ports when they have completed
some special investigation or exper
imentation. The other half include
scientists from local institutions, es
pecially the University of California,
and noted scientists who are passing
through this area.
Outstanding Speakers
All faculty members in the biolog
ical science department have been
asked to propose speakers for the
seminar, or to give information on
any outstanding men in the vicinity.
To enable the staff and graduate
students to hear first hand reports
on researches in various fields of
biology is the aim of these seminars.
They also serve to make contact with
the men doing research, and make
advanced study more interesting.
Collaboration Stimulated
The seminars have stimulated col
laborations between noted scientists

and Stanford students in research. I
Other students have become inter- j
ested in the field discussed, and
changed their field in biology. The
seminars also result in friendly co
operation between schools.
Dr. C. V. Taylor, head of the bio
logical science department now, j
started these seminars over ten years
ago. They have been in charge of
different people from year to year,
and sometimes committees have '
chosen the speakers. This year Ar- I
thur C. Giese, associate professor of j
biology, has been in charge of the ]
seminars.
Cyclotron Inventor, Speaker
Among the famous speakers that j
have addressed the seminar is E. O. !

Lawrence of the University of Cal
ifornia. He is the inventor of the cy
clotron, and spoke on its application
to biological problems. He is a Nobel
)rize winner.
Last year Dr. Roughton of a uni
versity in England was here at the
time for conference, and spoke on
aviation in physiology.
!>() Speakers a Year
The seminar attempts to have 30
speakers a year. In the past most
of the speakers from other areas who
have been here have accepted their
invitations to speak when at all pos
sible.
Next week William McElroy, a
National Research Council Fellow
at Stanford University this quarter,
will speak on the "Effect of Narcot
ics on Enzyme Systems." "Respira
tion and Fermentation in Mammal
ian Tissues" will be the topic dis
cussed by John Field, professor of
physiology, the following week.
Blinks to Speak
The last seminar of the autumn
quarter will feature Lawrence
Blinks, director of the Hopkins Ma
tine Station, a branch of Stanford.
His subject will be "Rapid Record
ing of the Time Course in Photo
synthesis."
Next quarter's series of seminars
will be begun by a speech by Dr.
Theodore Green, professor of phil
osophy, on the "Place of Science in
Liberal Arts Curriculum."
Other seminars by different sec
tions of ihe biology department are
given, including some of embryology
and genetics, in addition to the gen
eral seminar.

biology, has been in charge of the ]
seminars.
Cyclotron Inventor, Speaker
Among the famous speakers that j
have addressed the seminar is E. O. !

Lawrence of the University of Cal
ifornia. He is the inventor of the cy
clotron, and spoke on its application
to biological problems. He is a Nobel
)rize winner.
Last year Dr. Roughton of a uni
versity in England was here at the
time for conference, and spoke on
aviation in physiology.
!>() Speakers a Year
The seminar attempts to have 30
speakers a year. In the past most
of the speakers from other areas who
have been here have accepted their
invitations to speak when at all pos
sible.
Next week William McElroy, a
National Research Council Fellow
at Stanford University this quarter,
will speak on the "Effect of Narcot
ics on Enzyme Systems." "Respira
tion and Fermentation in Mammal
ian Tissues" will be the topic dis
cussed by John Field, professor of
physiology, the following week.
Blinks to Speak
The last seminar of the autumn
quarter will feature Lawrence
Blinks, director of the Hopkins Ma
tine Station, a branch of Stanford.
His subject will be "Rapid Record
ing of the Time Course in Photo
synthesis."
Next quarter's series of seminars
will be begun by a speech by Dr.
Theodore Green, professor of phil
osophy, on the "Place of Science in
Liberal Arts Curriculum."
Other seminars by different sec
tions of ihe biology department are
given, including some of embryology
and genetics, in addition to the gen
eral seminar.
The biological science depart
ment's weekly seminars try to bring
outstanding men to Stanford to
speak on all fields of biology and
medical problems of general inter
est.
About half of the speakers are
Stanford professors, who make re
ports when they have completed
some special investigation or exper
imentation. The other half include
scientists from local institutions, es
pecially the University of California,
and noted scientists who are passing
through this area.
Outstanding Speakers
All faculty members in the biolog
ical science department have been
asked to propose speakers for the
seminar, or to give information on
any outstanding men in the vicinity.
To enable the staff and graduate
students to hear first hand reports
on researches in various fields of
biology is the aim of these seminars.
They also serve to make contact with
the men doing research, and make
advanced study more interesting.
Collaboration Stimulated
The seminars have stimulated col
laborations between noted scientists

and Stanford students in research. I
Other students have become inter- j
ested in the field discussed, and
changed their field in biology. The
seminars also result in friendly co
operation between schools.
Dr. C. V. Taylor, head of the bio
logical science department now, j
started these seminars over ten years
ago. They have been in charge of
different people from year to year,
and sometimes committees have '
chosen the speakers. This year Ar- I
thur C. Giese, associate professor of j
biology, has been in charge of the ]
seminars.
