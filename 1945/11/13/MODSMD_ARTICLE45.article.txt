# Corbus To Appear At Big Rally
## 
### 
Bill Corbus, Stanford All-Ameri
can guard in 1932 and 1933, has ac
cepted Rally Comm's invitation to
appear at the rally to be held pre
vious to the Stanford-Stockton Com
mando tilt on Thursday night. Cor
bus is just one of the big surprises
that Rally Comm has in store for the
A.S.S.U. members during the pre
game rally and at the game.
Corbus was a member of the
famous "Vow Boys" in 193.') and it
was he who helped (hem keep
their promise never to drop a
game to U.S.C. by booting two of
the field goals for which be was
so noted in the closing minutes of
the fourth quarter with the score
tied 7-7, thus giving the Indians a
13-7 victory and a start in the
fulfillment of a vow which his
teammates never broke in the fol
lowing two seasons.
He also helped the Cardinals to
go to the Rose Bowl that year when
he kicked another field goal in the
first quarter against UCLA to give
the home team a 3-0 win in a game
that was scoreless the rest of the
afternoon. Bill narrowly missed an
other goal in that same contest.
An all-coast guard, Corbus was
also a unanimous choice for Ail-
American honors in 1932 and 1933.
He graduated in 1934 with a degree
in Economics and was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa, honorary scholastic so
ciety.
A resident of Menlo Park in the
years after his graduation, Bill may
be known to many Stanfordites as
one of the officials on the programs
m Bay Area football games. Stan
ford will be looking forward to your
visit and talk. Bill, and incidentally
Stanford students, we hear he's one
swelluva guy.
As we said, Rally Com has in
formed us that they have devised
some ingenious stunts for the ral
ly and game; so ingenious and
secretive that they are kept un
der lock and key; and reportedly
so good that Rally Com mem
bers refuse to divulge them.
Remerrfber that this is the first
authentic rally — that is, a rally
with a real purpose—since 1942;
so lei's all get out and "join the
band" Thursday night and put in
our two cents worth. No one but
the Lord knows the power of the
Indian grid squad, hut that doesn't
mean that we can't find out Satur
day. Be There!

A resident of Menlo Park in the
years after his graduation, Bill may
be known to many Stanfordites as
one of the officials on the programs
m Bay Area football games. Stan
ford will be looking forward to your
visit and talk. Bill, and incidentally
Stanford students, we hear he's one
swelluva guy.
As we said, Rally Com has in
formed us that they have devised
some ingenious stunts for the ral
ly and game; so ingenious and
secretive that they are kept un
der lock and key; and reportedly
so good that Rally Com mem
bers refuse to divulge them.
Remerrfber that this is the first
authentic rally — that is, a rally
with a real purpose—since 1942;
so lei's all get out and "join the
band" Thursday night and put in
our two cents worth. No one but
the Lord knows the power of the
Indian grid squad, hut that doesn't
mean that we can't find out Satur
day. Be There!
Bill Corbus, Stanford All-Ameri
can guard in 1932 and 1933, has ac
cepted Rally Comm's invitation to
appear at the rally to be held pre
vious to the Stanford-Stockton Com
mando tilt on Thursday night. Cor
bus is just one of the big surprises
that Rally Comm has in store for the
A.S.S.U. members during the pre
game rally and at the game.
Corbus was a member of the
famous "Vow Boys" in 193.') and it
was he who helped (hem keep
their promise never to drop a
game to U.S.C. by booting two of
the field goals for which be was
so noted in the closing minutes of
the fourth quarter with the score
tied 7-7, thus giving the Indians a
13-7 victory and a start in the
fulfillment of a vow which his
teammates never broke in the fol
lowing two seasons.
He also helped the Cardinals to
go to the Rose Bowl that year when
he kicked another field goal in the
first quarter against UCLA to give
the home team a 3-0 win in a game
that was scoreless the rest of the
afternoon. Bill narrowly missed an
other goal in that same contest.
An all-coast guard, Corbus was
also a unanimous choice for Ail-
American honors in 1932 and 1933.
He graduated in 1934 with a degree
in Economics and was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa, honorary scholastic so
ciety.
