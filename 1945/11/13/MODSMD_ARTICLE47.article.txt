Current excitement about Stanford's forthcoming game with
the Stockton Commandos has tended to shove the progress of
the basketball team into the background. It seems hard to real
ize that an Indian team will again enter into Coast Conference
competition, but with the arrival of winter quarter, Stanford
cagemen will be dogging the hardwoods trying to annex wins
for a battery of rabid rooters.
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
This leads to the question that has probably been puzzling
many of the Stanford student body—"What kind of team will
the Cardinals field this season?" The only basis for predicting
the success of the Indian five is by comparative analysis. The
only drawback in using this method so common in exposition
is that there is no basis for comparison. Our teams have been
out of the running for so many years that there is no way of
telling what will happen. Returning lettermen have bolstered
the strength of other colleges and universities, but we have no
returning lettermen, no team from last year to judge by.
"IF"
If we could pick the winners by coaches instead of by squads,
we would pick Everett Dean and Stanford to top the list. Dean's
offense is one of the most effective I have ever seen, and if
(there's that word again) he can get his prospects to run through
the deceptive "five-man weave" flawlessly, and sharpen up his
renowned fast break, a lot of people are going to be surprised
when Stanford starts off its conference debut with a victory, or
upset, as all the sports writers and sports analysts will call it.
When Coach Dean returned to the campus early in October,
be stated that Stanford's chances would be good if he could get
four or five good players to build his offense with and enough
capable reserves to fill out the team. At the first rally held this
quarter, Dean said that if the boys had as much ability as they
have spirit, they might not end up in the conference cellar be
hind more experienced teams.
For .future reference we will dub the basketball team the
"if" squad, for this small two-letter symbol seems to sum up the
potentialities of the Stanford cagers.
Whether or not the Cardinal five ends up at the bottom of
the pile, I know that all members of the A.S.S.U. will be over
joyed at the chance to use their student body cards for some
thing else besides decoration. The pavilion will again be the
scene of enthusiastic rooting and heated contests. It will also
be well lighted in sharp contrast to the lighting effects at the
various dances that have been at the pavilion during the past
few years.

is that there is no basis for comparison. Our teams have been
out of the running for so many years that there is no way of
telling what will happen. Returning lettermen have bolstered
the strength of other colleges and universities, but we have no
returning lettermen, no team from last year to judge by.
"IF"
If we could pick the winners by coaches instead of by squads,
we would pick Everett Dean and Stanford to top the list. Dean's
offense is one of the most effective I have ever seen, and if
(there's that word again) he can get his prospects to run through
the deceptive "five-man weave" flawlessly, and sharpen up his
renowned fast break, a lot of people are going to be surprised
when Stanford starts off its conference debut with a victory, or
upset, as all the sports writers and sports analysts will call it.
When Coach Dean returned to the campus early in October,
be stated that Stanford's chances would be good if he could get
four or five good players to build his offense with and enough
capable reserves to fill out the team. At the first rally held this
quarter, Dean said that if the boys had as much ability as they
have spirit, they might not end up in the conference cellar be
hind more experienced teams.
For .future reference we will dub the basketball team the
"if" squad, for this small two-letter symbol seems to sum up the
potentialities of the Stanford cagers.
Whether or not the Cardinal five ends up at the bottom of
the pile, I know that all members of the A.S.S.U. will be over
joyed at the chance to use their student body cards for some
thing else besides decoration. The pavilion will again be the
scene of enthusiastic rooting and heated contests. It will also
be well lighted in sharp contrast to the lighting effects at the
various dances that have been at the pavilion during the past
few years.
Current excitement about Stanford's forthcoming game with
the Stockton Commandos has tended to shove the progress of
the basketball team into the background. It seems hard to real
ize that an Indian team will again enter into Coast Conference
competition, but with the arrival of winter quarter, Stanford
cagemen will be dogging the hardwoods trying to annex wins
for a battery of rabid rooters.
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
This leads to the question that has probably been puzzling
many of the Stanford student body—"What kind of team will
the Cardinals field this season?" The only basis for predicting
the success of the Indian five is by comparative analysis. The
only drawback in using this method so common in exposition
is that there is no basis for comparison. Our teams have been
out of the running for so many years that there is no way of
telling what will happen. Returning lettermen have bolstered
the strength of other colleges and universities, but we have no
returning lettermen, no team from last year to judge by.
