It's a custom around the Farm never to forget one of the
Stanford Family. Whenever we feel that one of our family
has been unjustly criticized, the Daily tries to answer these
charges. One of our family—Mr. Shaughnessy—has been the
object of bitter criticism during the past week which we feel is
unjust criticism. *
Shaughnessy—who revived Pacific Coast football with his "T"
formation tactics in 1940 —has been accused by the University
of Pittsburgh students as being inadequate for his job as football
coach there.
Now, Pittsburgh de-emphasized football in 1938 when the
university felt that the Panther teams were too good. Pittsburgh
then became a second-rate power and absorbed bad beatings at
the hands of Eastern schools.
Then, in 1943, the administration did a right-about-face and
hired the best they could get —Shaughnessy—to produce a rep
resentative team from the skyscraper university. He was told
upon taking the job that studies came first, foofball second.
Immediately the university plunged Shaughnessy into a
tough schedule against all of the Eastern grid giants (Notre
Dame, Illinois, Ohio State). The first year his team was pretty
poor. Last year the team was progressively better and this year,
against top competition, he turned out a fairly representative
team. ;
Why the university students feel that Shaughnessy is inade
quate we can't understand. Maybe the students are thinking
too much about Jock Sutherland's powerhouses at Pittsburgh
10 years ago. Maybe they don't like the colorful razzle-dazzle
plays that we saw Shaughnessy use here at Stanford. Maybe
they don't realize that the best coach in the country can't turn
out powerful teams without the material.
Well, Stanford won't forget what Shaughnessy did for us
when he was a member of the Stanford family. We won't forget
that rainy day we sat and watched the Indians run over Santa
Clara, 27-7; we won't forget taking the Axe away from Cal for
the first time in five years; we won't forget his Rose Bowl vic
tory over Nebraska in 1941.
Of course we're prejudiced, but we kind of feel like Knute
Rockne when he said, upon being asked who the best two
coaches in the country were, "Well, the other one is Clark
Shaughnessy."

It's a custom around the Farm never to forget one of the
Stanford Family. Whenever we feel that one of our family
has been unjustly criticized, the Daily tries to answer these
charges. One of our family—Mr. Shaughnessy—has been the
object of bitter criticism during the past week which we feel is
unjust criticism. *
Shaughnessy—who revived Pacific Coast football with his "T"
formation tactics in 1940 —has been accused by the University
of Pittsburgh students as being inadequate for his job as football
coach there.
Now, Pittsburgh de-emphasized football in 1938 when the
university felt that the Panther teams were too good. Pittsburgh
then became a second-rate power and absorbed bad beatings at
the hands of Eastern schools.
Then, in 1943, the administration did a right-about-face and
hired the best they could get —Shaughnessy—to produce a rep
resentative team from the skyscraper university. He was told
upon taking the job that studies came first, foofball second.
Immediately the university plunged Shaughnessy into a
tough schedule against all of the Eastern grid giants (Notre
Dame, Illinois, Ohio State). The first year his team was pretty
poor. Last year the team was progressively better and this year,
against top competition, he turned out a fairly representative
team. ;
Why the university students feel that Shaughnessy is inade
quate we can't understand. Maybe the students are thinking
too much about Jock Sutherland's powerhouses at Pittsburgh
10 years ago. Maybe they don't like the colorful razzle-dazzle
plays that we saw Shaughnessy use here at Stanford. Maybe
they don't realize that the best coach in the country can't turn
out powerful teams without the material.
Well, Stanford won't forget what Shaughnessy did for us
when he was a member of the Stanford family. We won't forget
that rainy day we sat and watched the Indians run over Santa
Clara, 27-7; we won't forget taking the Axe away from Cal for
the first time in five years; we won't forget his Rose Bowl vic
tory over Nebraska in 1941.
Of course we're prejudiced, but we kind of feel like Knute
Rockne when he said, upon being asked who the best two
coaches in the country were, "Well, the other one is Clark
Shaughnessy."
