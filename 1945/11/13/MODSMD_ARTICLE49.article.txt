# Shushies In Near Upset
## 
### JIM WELTER 
Activity in the first round of the
Army's elimination basketball tour
nament found most of the contests
being decided as expected. This first
set of games was played last Wed
nesday and Thursday nights in the
Men's Gym.
The closest thing to an upset
was registered in the Shushies-
Buzz Bomb tilt—and that fray is
still being protested. The way
the score-book tally has it, the
Buzz Bombs defeated the Shush -
ies, 34-33. The Buzz Bombs are
a pretty good ERC outfit but the
Shushies are the highest scoring
combination of the EM leagues
and consequently were considered
slightly above their younger ri
vals.
Only one contest turned out to be
a definite runaway. The Vita Men,
only undefeated EM five, slaugh
tered their ERC opponents with a
47-11 attack. Ivan Ross led the
scoring for this game—and for the
evening—with a total of 26 points.
Two well-stacked groups of the
"C" league came through in the
initial - round unscathed, although
not without a little work. The Lily
whiters overcame the truly fighting
Fightin' Ferries, 30-25, while the
Coots bested a weak Zipper ag
gregation, 22-15.
A new and powerful - looking
team appeared as the Bullets
downed the Bums, IX-12. The
Bullets are a combination of (he
Chickens and the A. T. & Q. Club,
both of which were recent victims
of numerous enlistments.
The top two ERC clubs also sur
vived the first round. The Corsairs
had no trouble topping the Zig-Zigs,
43-22, while the Li'l Papooses were
advancing to the next round by
virtue of a forfeit victory.
One other engagement was played
off. The B.F.'s easily tamed the
Giant Five, 28-11.
Second - round matches this
week will feature the following
pairings: Coots- L i'l Papooses,
Lilywhiters-Bullets, Buzz Bombs-
Corsairs, and VitaMcn-B.F.'s. All
except possibly the last of the
above-mentioned tilts promise to
be close and hard-fought.
