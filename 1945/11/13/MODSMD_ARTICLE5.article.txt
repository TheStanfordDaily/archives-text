# Chaparral To Be Sold Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Chaparral will be on sale
Wednesday and Thursday, it was
announced today. "Because every
body's so anxious for the Chappie,"
Pat Pagen, business manager, said,
"the first bunch hot off the press
will be sold Wednesday, and the
last bunch, only a few hundred, will
be sold on Thursday." The maga
zine may be bought on the History
corner and at the Cellar from 9 a.m.
until noon.
The theme for this issue is "recon
version," and the change from a
high percentage of women in the
ratio to a high percentage of men,
and the change from War Board
activities to sports will be empha
sized. The Chappie is dedicated to
the boys who have come back to the
Farm from the wars.
There will be a "terrific cover
illustrating all that," Miss Pagen
added. It will be a four-color
drawing by A 1 Larson instead of
the color photograph. "We have
disbanded the puppet for this year,
in line with reconversion, we
have reconverted," she said.
The Chappie will feature a story
by Stan Shpetner on a day in a
Russian class, and one by Mike Min
chin about radio. Don Miller did the
center spread, a series of cartoons
about the campus dining halls, in
cluding Encina and the Cellar.
Stan Manus, of the ASTP, and
Dick Dunbar arc also drawing
cartoons for the issue. An article
about where to go on dates, and
the Fables of the Farm will of
course be there. "You will prob
ably find a story about your best
friend in it," Miss Pagen said.
The Chappie Queen, 'the most
beautiful we've ever had," according
to Old Boy Don Allen, was chosen
from the freshman class, famous for
its beautiful women with high lO's.
"There will be lots of great ads,"
said Pat Pagen, settling down to
work on the December Chappie. "It's
a terrific issue," added the Old Boy,
"at the new low price of 25 cents.
Be sure to read it, and don't forget
to send it to your friends."
