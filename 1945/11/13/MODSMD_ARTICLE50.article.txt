# Crowd May Run to 25,000 For Grid Game Saturday
## 
### 
Saturday's tilt with the Stockton
! Air Base, the first in three years
\ for Stanford, is being looked for
j ward to by the Farm populace, and
| crowd estimates have run from 10,-
i 000 to 25,000. For the majority of
Stanford students, this game will
! mark the first time that they have
ever witnessed the Big Red Ma
i chine in action.
No names of football familiarity
dot the squad lineup, but the boys
j —green as they are in football ex
perience—will play a game that is

reminiscent of Stanford gridiron
fight. Most of the fellows on the
squad can claim some pigskin expe
rience in high school, but nothing
beyond that, with a few possible ex
ceptions. And that is nothing to be
discouraged about. Oregon State
College, with only one man on the
squad with varsity background,
knocked the University of Wash
ington out of the Rose Bowl.
The tussle against the Stockton !
Air Base team will not lack any
trimmings that go with football

games. Rally Com is organizing a
rooting section. The public address
system will be handled by Don Lie
bendorfer, and programs with num
bers and positions of the players will
be issued at the gate.
Stockton is still the mystery team
around here. Nobody knows who's
on the team, or what kind of of
fensive they have. Their record for
the season, however, is good. They
have beaten C.0.P., tied Albany
Navy, and lost to St. Mary's by only
a 26-point margin.
