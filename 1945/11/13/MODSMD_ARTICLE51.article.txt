# '38 Thornhill Team Ends Fair Season With Startling Win Over Dartmouth
## 
### STU MILLAR 
They were billed as "the best since
! the Vow Boys," the grid squad that
i Tiny Thornhill oiled up for the '38
j season. They were the biggest, fast
est, most spirited footballers to
grace the Farm turf since the days
of Grayson—before the season.
They had veterans ir.';e Clark. Za
gar, Calvelli, Anderson, Fay, Paul
man and Ledeboer to lead the way.
They looked good.
But Santa Clara, which had upset
the Thornhill cart for two years in
a row, did it again. They swamped
Rose Bowl hopes, spirit and every
! thing else the Cards had to offer by
j a score of 22 to 0. Again the Cards
had to rebuild before the season
was hardly under way.
Rebuild they did, though. Next
j week, against a weak W.S.C. team,
they regained the necessary con
| fidence and sureness so nocessary to
; a successful grid aggregation as they
j topped the Cougars 8 to 0.
Oregon came to town, unbeaten
j and over-confident. It was a breath
| er, they thought. The Stanford
i team did everything right and out
j scored the visitors 27 to 16.
A pinkish—it couldn't be rosy af

ter the first shellacking—tint again
glowed over the campus. S.C., if
hurdled, would be the last of tough
Coast competition. Troy wasn't
hurdled. The took Stanford 13 to 2
with Howard Jones pass plays.
Thus ended the pintcish glow. It
grew gray and then black as U.C.-
L.A., Washington, and finally Cal
took the locals by low scores on
successive week-ends. It was a
combination of bad luck, poor refs
and moe bad luck that lost the
games.
The Big Game score of 6 to 0 told
the story. It was close all the way
except for one Bottari to Reginato
pass.
Then came Dartmouth, the class
of the East. Led by Ail-American
Bob McLeod, the White Indians
were heralded to swamp one of the
poorer outfits in the West.
The Stanford team rose to the
heights that it was capable of and
completely outplayed the Dart
mouth crew. It was a decisive 23
to 13 score. McLeod was good. But
Paulman, finishing his varsity ca
reer, Norm Standlee, Hampton Pool
and Pete Zagar were better.
