# Modern Dance Students Seek Secrets of Charm
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Hours at dancing school spent
stumbling over the feet of a weary
partner or seeing too many ballets
and Zorina movies are all moving
factors in the large sign-ups for be
ginning modern dance. Plump girls,
thin girls, tall and short, are all mo
tivated by the idea that within one
semester Mrs. Miriam Lidster, in
structor in modern dance, will turn
the awkward, clumsy girl into a
sylph-like creature of grace and
charm.
The aim of elementary modern
dance is not to train girls to become
perfectionists but to enable the aver
age girl lo acquire a bit more grace
and poise, a sense of co-ordination
and timing, and a physically health
ier body.
Leotards Are Dance Costume
The costumes worn in modern
dance are far from the billowing
skirts or the sequined dresses worn
by many professional dancers. They
are close-fitting blue leotards which,
though not flattering to the figure,
allow freedom of motion.
The student finds that she is not
allowed to begin executing leaps and

difficult dance steps as she might
have hoped, but is given numerous
exercises—exercises for her arches,
ankles, back, and stomach. She
sometimes wonders whether she
wandered into a calisthenics class by
nistake.
Awkwardness Is Eliminated
Perhaps the most difficult aspect
of modern dance is co-ordination.
The beginner finds that in many of
the elementary dance steps her legs
will be going one way, while her
arms fly wildly off in another. It is
constant drill and practice that de
velops the four limbs into a smooth
running quartette.
Graceful Mrs. Lidster is the envy
of all her pupils. As she illustrates
a step or leap, the students wonder
at her agility and nimbleness. It ap
pears to be so easy, and yet when
they are instructed to follow her ex
ample, it is not the dainty patter of
elf-like feet that one hears, but a
sound resembling a herd of young
elephants.
Learn How To Fall
Falls are another interesting fea
ture of modern dance. In doing ele
mentary back and side falls, the
dancer is to sink gracefully to the
floor and slide into the fall. The be
ginner, however, finds it rather dif
ficult to sink and slide, and her falls
are more often accompanied by
thumps and bruises. These bruises

and the intense stiffness that follows
are the battle scars of an elementary
dance student. A student seen hob
bling around the Quad is probably
not a victim of a hit and run driver
but of a modern dance class.
Roommates of beginning dance
students are often the innocent suf
ferers of the student's enthusiasm
for dance. Believing that practice
makes perfect and wanting to give
vent to her new talents, the dance
beginner must show her roommate
all the accumulative dance steps and
falls she has learned for the day.
This is also a good way to lose any
friends one might have in the room
below.
Grace Is Aquired
Although Stanford's beginning
dance students may never prove to
be serious competition to Ruth St.
Dennis, the master of modern dance,
the girls do find that their walk is
smoother and their shoulders a little
straighter after one quarter. So note
the graceful creatures gliding across
the campus—they're not ballerinas,
they're modern dance pupils.
