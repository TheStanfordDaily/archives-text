SEATTLE, Nov. 12 (UP). â€”The
Boeing Aircraft Company today
look the wraps off a new single
engined fighter plane, described as
the first aircraft designed with
contro-rotating propellers, and a
speed "considerably in excess of
450 miles an hour."
Dubbed the XFBS, the armored,
stub-nosed aircraft can be used as a
fighter, torpedo plane, bomber, at
tack plane or interceptor, Boeings
said. It can carry a bomb weighing
6,400 pounds, or its equivalent, in
two one-ton torpedoes.
Its most novel feature, contra
rotating 13 l/ 2-foot propellers, driven
by a 28-cyfinder 3-600 horsepower
Pratt and Whitney aircooled engine,
give the aircraft a ceiling compar
able to that of the giant Superfort
ress.
