# AFL Raises Pay Demand
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 12 (UP).
—The AFL Bakery Wagon Drivers'
Union, whose strike has closed the
majority oi' San Francisco's bakeries
tonight, raised its pay increase de
mand as virtually no progress was
made toward settling three strikes
which have tied up bread produc
tion, milk deliveries, machine shops,
shipyards and dry cleaning estab
lishments.
The bread strike threatened to
engulf other Pacific Coast cities as
the union withdrew its demand of
$62.50 per week and asked for $70.
The wage rate now is $54.30 per
week.
Arbitration Fails
A "peace meeting" in Mayor Rog
er Lapham's office failed to bring
agreement between the striking
drivers and five major bakeries and
22 independent Italian and French
bakeries. The majority of bakeries
closed down when drivers struck
the Langendorf Baking Company.
Company officials, in a statement
issued after the meeting, said they
had offered a wage of $60 per week,
"an increase of 25 per cent above
the $48 scale they had in 1941."
With commissions to drivers, the
statement said, average earnings
would be "about $71 a week, ap
proximately 48 pe cent above earn
ings in 1941."
Employers Offer to Settle
The statement said the employers
offered to raise inside workers to
$45.50 per week for a 37V->-hour
week, constituting "an increase of
30 per cent." The offers were made
retroactive to Oct. 11 and the em
ployers, the statement said, pro
posed to submit to arbitration the
differences between the old contract
"and all of the demands the union
served on us in September."
"The union not only rejected our
proposed increases but rejected our
offer of arbitration and went on
strike after giving us an ultimatum
of one hour to accept their demands.
Now they have gone even further
and have increased their demands
while the strike is in progress."
