### 
TOKYO, Nov. 12. (UP) -Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur announced to
day that he is preparing a directive
which will free Japan's millions of
farmers from the chains of slavery.
He asserted at the same time that
he has now succeeded in smashing
beyond repair the feudal system
which made enslavement of the Jap
anese people possible.
Mac Arthur, in a headquarters
statement, promised the farmers
"free marketing in a state of free
dom" by removing "the shackles
which now hold farmers and their
families in a condition approximat
ing slavery."
Then, summarizing the results so
far of his occupation, Mac Arthur
said:
"There is nothing easy or soft
about the life Japanese must lead
before they can be accepted as a
peaceful nation.
"As the day by day story of the
occupation unfolds it must now be
understood that the primary objec
tive of the occupation forces is to
destroy the old system, exact toll for
past misdeeds and create a nation of
people who will forever lead a dem
ocratic way of life. This objective
must be achieved through states
manship, leadership and education.
"With successive strokes, it is be
ing proved to the world that there
can be no lasting profit spiritually,
materially, territorially, economical
ly or militarily to be gained out of
wars of aggression. Acts in effectu
ating the occupation of the Allied
nations have shocked the hierarchy
of Japan's feudal caste beyond com
prehension.
