### 
BALTIMORE, Nox. 12 (UP).â€”The
Glenn L. Martin Company entered
the domestic air transport market
today with a $7,000,000 sale to the
Pennsylvania - Central Airlines of
new five - mile - a - minute aircraft
which Martin officials said could
reduce current airline fares by 30
per cent and run any present com
mercial plane "out of business."
Sale of the twin - engine, 40-
passenger Martin 202 apparently
marked the opening bid of the
bomber and flying boat manufac
turer for the place now occupied
by the Douglas Aircraft Company,
manufacturer of the univei'sally
used DC-3.
