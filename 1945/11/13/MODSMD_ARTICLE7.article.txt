# Students Relax at ‘Y’ For Mid-Week Pick-Up
## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
"Thanks for the cookies ... I've got
to leave for a gym class . . . Glad
to be a fourth next Wednesday."
It's Wednesday afternoon in thc"Y"
lounge, and the weekly .'5 to 5 "party
time."
The "Y's" mid-week pick-up,
when the lounge is thrown open to
those who want, to meet friends,
make friends, or sip tea and read
magazines, is a long standing cam
pus tradition. Discontinued during
war-time pressure, the Wednesday
afternoons have been revived this
'ail.
A combination of the Cellar, the
music listening room, and home,
the "Y" Wednesday afternoons put
a musical background behind
bridge, light studying, or brush
ing up on Life magazines.
At 3 p.m. the tea cups and cookie
plates arc brought in by two mem
bers of the "Y" social committee.
The lounge is shut off from the
YWCA office, and cards and maga
zines come out. "We haven't found
anybody yet that's been left over
from the week before," admitted
Betty Wellington, co-chairman of
the social committee.
Records are borrowed from collec
tions on the campus and range from
classics to Boogie-woogie, with em
phasis on the semi-classics. When
the lounge agrees, the record player
may be turned off and the radio
switched on.
"Kvcry Stanford student is in

vited," says Rosalind Murray, co
chairman with IMiss Wellington.
"Don't feel you won't know any
one, because you'll probably find
a lot of your friends taking a ten
minute rest."
Miss Murray also stressed that
men, as well as Stanford women, arc
invited to drop in from 3 to 5. "If
you think you have to study, biing
your hooks along," she suggested.
A typieal "Y" Wednesday after
noon roll call shows almost as many
activities as people. Four people sit
yogi fashion on the carpet, playing
bridge and drinking tea. Two kibitz
ers back them up, while near the
wall, two women discuss a knotty
physics problem over open binders.
In a small alcove, a group may
he just enjoying talking . . . talk
ing about classes, about friends,
or wondering how best to retrieve
the cookie plate. Two or three oth
er students may he engrossed in
magazines, trying to catch up on a
story between a 2 o'clock class and
a 4 o'clock lab.
If the weather is pleasant, strag
glers may be out on the balcony or
looking towards the post office from
the windows.
As Miss Patricia Davidson, execu
tive secretary of the "Y", put it,
"The Wednesday afternoon plan has
been revived to give Stanford stu
dents a pleasant atmpsohere in
which to relax. There are no
speeches, no meetings. Just tea, rec
ords. and congenial people."

a 4 o'clock lab.
If the weather is pleasant, strag
glers may be out on the balcony or
looking towards the post office from
the windows.
As Miss Patricia Davidson, execu
tive secretary of the "Y", put it,
"The Wednesday afternoon plan has
been revived to give Stanford stu
dents a pleasant atmpsohere in
which to relax. There are no
speeches, no meetings. Just tea, rec
ords. and congenial people."
"Thanks for the cookies ... I've got
to leave for a gym class . . . Glad
to be a fourth next Wednesday."
It's Wednesday afternoon in thc"Y"
lounge, and the weekly .'5 to 5 "party
time."
The "Y's" mid-week pick-up,
when the lounge is thrown open to
those who want, to meet friends,
make friends, or sip tea and read
magazines, is a long standing cam
pus tradition. Discontinued during
war-time pressure, the Wednesday
afternoons have been revived this
'ail.
A combination of the Cellar, the
music listening room, and home,
the "Y" Wednesday afternoons put
a musical background behind
bridge, light studying, or brush
ing up on Life magazines.
At 3 p.m. the tea cups and cookie
plates arc brought in by two mem
bers of the "Y" social committee.
The lounge is shut off from the
YWCA office, and cards and maga
zines come out. "We haven't found
anybody yet that's been left over
from the week before," admitted
Betty Wellington, co-chairman of
the social committee.
Records are borrowed from collec
tions on the campus and range from
classics to Boogie-woogie, with em
phasis on the semi-classics. When
the lounge agrees, the record player
may be turned off and the radio
switched on.
"Kvcry Stanford student is in

vited," says Rosalind Murray, co
chairman with IMiss Wellington.
"Don't feel you won't know any
one, because you'll probably find
a lot of your friends taking a ten
minute rest."
Miss Murray also stressed that
men, as well as Stanford women, arc
invited to drop in from 3 to 5. "If
you think you have to study, biing
your hooks along," she suggested.
A typieal "Y" Wednesday after
noon roll call shows almost as many
activities as people. Four people sit
yogi fashion on the carpet, playing
bridge and drinking tea. Two kibitz
ers back them up, while near the
wall, two women discuss a knotty
physics problem over open binders.
In a small alcove, a group may
he just enjoying talking . . . talk
ing about classes, about friends,
or wondering how best to retrieve
the cookie plate. Two or three oth
er students may he engrossed in
magazines, trying to catch up on a
story between a 2 o'clock class and
a 4 o'clock lab.
If the weather is pleasant, strag
glers may be out on the balcony or
looking towards the post office from
the windows.
