# Nautical Show On Deck Friday
## 1945 Gaieties' Tickets Sell Fast; Jane Frazier's Music Featured 
### 
To gobs who have other ideas about what the Navy should be, to gals
who tried to join and couldn't, to boys in khaki who want to see what
they missed—Mary Lou Patton has a suggestion.
Buy a ticket to the 1045 edition of Gaieties, "A Girl in Every Port," for
this Friday or Saturday night and take a mythical, magical tour from

Stanford to Alaska, from Cuba to
France and Russia, 'round the world
and back to Stanford.
Tickct Sale On
Tickets are on sale today from 9
to 4 p.m. at the English Corner, and
at the ASSU office from Wednesday
through Friday. Prices are $1.25,
$1.00, 85 cents and 55 cents.
One of the features of the show
which appears to hold promise is a
rendition of Shirley Hendrickson's
song, "You're Everything a Sailor
Dreams Of," sung by Don Scott to
Joanne Edwards in a scene entitled
"On Deck."
In the Alaskan scene the Taft Hall
quartet will sing "Eskimo Pic," writ
ten by Jo Green. In the quartet arc
Ken Dole, Everitt Hudson, Mike
Bowers, and Don Boothe. Knowing
Bowers, and Don Boothe.
Fra/icr Songs Featured
Bobbie Welch will sing a blues
number, "Don't Stand a Chance,"
with music and lyrics by Virginia
Clagett, and Rena Jean Black will
sing three of Jane Frazicr's latest:
"Why Is It?", "Let's Make It a Two
some," and "Plca.se Come Home."
Those Stanfordites who remember
Spring Show, 1944, will recall Miss
Black singing the hit, "P. O. Blues,"
also written by Miss Frazier. The
combination proved very successful
then and should provide one of the
most enjoyable parts of the produc
tion.
Dancing Scenes Planned
Most of the choreography for the
dances has been done by Orchesis,
with O. D. Phillips doing a great
deal. There'll be a Russian dance to
the .music of "Popolobiskis" by Jo
Green; a waltz number with five
singing waitresses, and a tango in
the Cuban song with music also by
Miss Bradford.
Four boys will do a Russian ho
pak—Don Briggs, Klas 801, Les Tint,
and Ed Marion. It would be inter
esting to go just to discover what a
"hopak" is.
Also Miss Patton, director, has an
nounced that there will be a surprise
number for the audience which has
never before been attempted in
Gaieties. Wonder what it is?
