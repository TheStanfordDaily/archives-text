## Attlee Stresses Cooperation In Speech on Atomic Bomb 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (UP). —Prime Minister Clement Attlee
told Congress today that the world must accept and practice the
Christian principle of the brotherhood of man if it is to survive the
atomic era.
"Man's material discoveries have outpaced his moral prog
ress," he said. 112
A few hours later—at 4:30 p.m.—he resumed his atomic bomb
talks with President Truman and Canadian Prime Minister W. L.
Mackenzie King out of which will emerge, Thursday or Friday,
a policy which the three leaders hope will lead to mutual world
trust and co-operation for enduring peace.
The discussions were suspended yesterday to permit tentative
drafting of the policy and to give Attlee time to prepare the ad
diess he delivered to a joint session of Congress.
The British Labor party leader made no direct reference to
his proposal that the atomic bomb and all secret weapons of
other nations be placed in an international pool for use only as
instruments to maintain peace.
But, reviewing Allied co-operation during World War 11, he
said:
"None of us would be here today unless all the Allies had
done their part, unless the unequaled fighting forces and match
less industrial scientific resources of the United States had been
thrown without reserve into the (Allied) pool." »
Only once did he specifically mention the bomb, but through
out his speech ran the urgent theme that man's scientific strides
make it imperative for all nations to know and understand each
other if civilization is to endure.
