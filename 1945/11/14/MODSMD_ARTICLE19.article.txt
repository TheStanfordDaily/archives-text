# Fall Issue Of Chappie Sells Today
## 
### 
The fall Chaparral is going on
sale today from 9 a.m. until noon
at the History corner and at the
Cellar. Boris Wolper, circulation
manager, announced that since the
Chappies are all printed there will
be only one day of sale, today, in
stead of two days as was previously
announced.
"Hurry and get your copy,"
Wolpcr urged, "because they will
go fast; and don't forget to huv
copies for your friends and your
family. They'll all want to read
the mag."
The Chaparral is being presented
in a new type of cover, a four-color
drawing instead of the photograph
of the Chappie puppet as was used
in previous issues of the magazine.
Al Larson, an artist whose work has
appeared in various art exhibits all
over the country, has done the cover
for this issue and for forthcoming
issues.
The theme of the humor maga
zine is "reconversion," illustrat
ing the changes that have taken
placc on the campus now that the
war is over. The fall Chappie is
dedicated to the veterans return
ing to Stanford from the service.
The Chappie will feature a story
by Stan Shpetner about a day in a
Russian class, and Mike Minchin has
written one about radio. The center
spread will be a series of cartoons
drawn by Don Miller characterizing
the various dining halls "on campus.
The Cellar, Encina, and a sorority
house will be included.
Cartoons
Stan Manus, a soldier in the AS
TP, and Dick Dunbar are doing
many cartoons for the magazine.
The usual Chappie features, pages
of jokes, an article about where to
go on dates, and the Fables of the
Farm will be there.
The Chappie Queen, of whom Old
Boy Don Allen has said "she is the
most beautiful we've ever had,"
will be given an important placc
in the issue, along with five Stanford
women modeling dresses from local
shops. The Queen (her identity is
always a secret until the magazine
comes out) was chosen from the
freshman class.
"Terrific Issue"
"It will be a terrific issue," said
the Old Boy, "at the new extraor
dinarily low price of 25 cents. Be
sure to get your copy."
Pat Pagen, business manager, an
nounced that all those who have
worked on this issue of the Chapar
ral, on either the editorial or busi
nesrs staffs, may pick up their com
plimentary copies at the A.S.S.U.
ofTicc on Thursday.
