CHUNGKING, Nov. 13 (UP). —Russia is evacuating Manchuria
and has granted permission to the Chinese Central Government
to fly 1,500 troops a day into Hsinking (Changchun), informed
quarters declared today amid persistent reports that Nationalist
forces had captured Shanhaikwan, strategic Manchurian gateway
city.
Chungking government reports said 30 large American air
transports manned by Chinese crews are ready to fly picked
troops of three Nationalist armies from Peiping to the Manchurian
capital, where a 300-man Nationalist military delegation has been
negotiating with the Russians.
The Nationalists have three armies in the Peiping-Tientsin area
—the 6th, 84th and 92nd—all earmarked for occupation duty in
Manchuria. They were flown there in U.S. Air Force transports.
Chinese crews must carry them to Manchuria.
Both Communists and Nationalists said one of the fiercest
battles of the civil war was raging at Shanhaikwan, pivotal Com
munist stronghold guarding the Peiping-Mukden railway pass
into Manchuria, but neither side was able to confirm reports that
the Nationalists had taken the city.
