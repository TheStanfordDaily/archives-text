# U.S. Lead In Peace Proposed
## Haley Urges Active Foreign Economic Policy 
### 
Closing his talk with the hope
that the United States will take the
lead in promoting peace by means
of an active foreign economic policy,
instead of just talking about it, Ber
nard F. Haley, professor of econom
ics, pointed out last night at the
Tuesday Evening Scries this coun
try's achievements and failures in
four aspects of our foreign economic
policy.
The main purposes of our for
eign economic policy as outlined
by Mr. Haley were: (1) the re
duction of economic reasons for
friction between the United States
and other countries; (2) the rais
ing of the economic well-being of
the world as a whole; (!{) the
maintenance of a high level of
income in this and other countries
in order to prevent disastrous
economic fluctuation; (4) the pro
motion of international economic
organizations to further these
aims.
In connection with the first, the
reduction of economic reasons for
friction, Mr. Haley, who was for
three years in the State Depart
ment, said that there are many in
cidents in which trade difficulties
concerning manipulation of prices,
exploitation of raw materials, and
water rights between countries have
been smoothed out by negotiation.
The United States contribution to
world well-being can be made in
two ways, the Stanford economist
said. First, wc can reduce trade
barriers which grew up during the
interval between the two wars. The
reciprocal trade agreements made
under the direction of Cordell Hull
were a weak tendency against the
general rise in tariffs, he stated.
Second, the countries with capi
tal can help reconstruct those with
tottering economies, by means of
loans.
Toward the third purpose, the
maintenance of a high level of in
come, little has been done as yet.
This is chiefly a domestic policy and
can be aided only in special foreign
cases where American action would
have a direct effect.
Toward the fourth aim, the pro
motion of international organiza
tions, we have made distinct prog
ress and may be proud of our
achievements, Mr. Haley comment
ed. We have made good connections
with Latin America, a good record
in international labor organization,
in food and agriculture and aviation
co-operation, and have indicated
our desire to sec an international
trade organization.—Pinker ton

Tuesday Evening Scries this coun
try's achievements and failures in
four aspects of our foreign economic
policy.
The main purposes of our for
eign economic policy as outlined
by Mr. Haley were: (1) the re
duction of economic reasons for
friction between the United States
and other countries; (2) the rais
ing of the economic well-being of
the world as a whole; (!{) the
maintenance of a high level of
income in this and other countries
in order to prevent disastrous
economic fluctuation; (4) the pro
motion of international economic
organizations to further these
aims.
In connection with the first, the
reduction of economic reasons for
friction, Mr. Haley, who was for
three years in the State Depart
ment, said that there are many in
cidents in which trade difficulties
concerning manipulation of prices,
exploitation of raw materials, and
water rights between countries have
been smoothed out by negotiation.
The United States contribution to
world well-being can be made in
two ways, the Stanford economist
said. First, wc can reduce trade
barriers which grew up during the
interval between the two wars. The
reciprocal trade agreements made
under the direction of Cordell Hull
were a weak tendency against the
general rise in tariffs, he stated.
Second, the countries with capi
tal can help reconstruct those with
tottering economies, by means of
loans.
Toward the third purpose, the
maintenance of a high level of in
come, little has been done as yet.
This is chiefly a domestic policy and
can be aided only in special foreign
cases where American action would
have a direct effect.
Toward the fourth aim, the pro
motion of international organiza
tions, we have made distinct prog
ress and may be proud of our
achievements, Mr. Haley comment
ed. We have made good connections
with Latin America, a good record
in international labor organization,
in food and agriculture and aviation
co-operation, and have indicated
our desire to sec an international
trade organization.—Pinker ton
