## Ballot Box Memo 
### 
Voters must remember that no matter how
small an election may seem, it plays a large
part in determining University and student pol
icies. Frosh will probably need little coaxing
to come to the polls, for today is their debut
into student government. But adequately fill
ing the other offices open will need the whole
hearted support of eligible voters.
Every /ear at election times it seems neces
sary wo don't know why to urge students
to come to the polls and vote. Today is no ex
ception. In today's elections students will vote
for freshman class officers, one representative
on Men's Council, and one representative on
the Board of Athletic Control.
Most important of these is perhaps the elec
tion of a B.A.C. representative, because this
marks the return of the B.A.C. to student life
and because it is the only office open to an a 11-
campus vote.
Stanford students should weigh carefully
the- qualities of the respective candidates and
vote according to their ability to fill the job.
But the most important factor is simply this
come down and vote!— M. S.
