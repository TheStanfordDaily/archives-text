# 'Independence' Defined
## 
### 
So you want to be Stanford men and women
- that is, BIG Stanford men and women—
BMOC's and BWOC's, no less! You've moved
into a small residence, perhaps as a sophomore
if you're a woman; as a freshman or sophomore
if you're a man.
"ff you're a woman you note that those small
residences have an "independent house pol
icy," at least that's what the Women's Housing
Plan says. Isn't that grand! Now you are free;
away from any close adult supervision; you
are no longer a freshman. So you decide that
you will show them you "know it all," perhaps
by having a class party or by taking a sopho
more sneak—older girls in the house have told
you a lot about previous sophomore sneaks.
That v/as the thing to do to show your class
"unity," your house "spirit." Only your sneak
is different:
You don't get up early in the morning, dis
arrange the rooms of upperclassmen, blow a
few horns, or go off for a day of fun with your
class. No, you don't do just those things. In
stead you act your noisiest and rowdiest, be
yond the limits of good taste and decent con
duct, and in doing so you gain the resentment
of all those persons living in small residences
who are concerned about the reputation their
house maintains; the resentment of all those
who have found something of real value in
that "independent house policy" and who are
willing to accept the responsibilities that go
with such a policy.
Having long had faith in the ability of col
lege-age men and v/omen to exercise their own
self-discipline, to govern themselves through
the living group without the necessity of end
loss rules and regulations imposed from the
outside, we are concerned over the obvious
lack of responsibility of a few persons whose
aclions may be detrimental to a whole group.
Sophomore sneaks, class parties, house sere
nades, etc., should be encouraged, we think, but
lately their value has been lessened by the
juvenile attitude that seems to have gone with
such functions. We remember all the argu
ments that "college students in recent years
have been younger on the average," and that
"war-time insecurity has exerted its influence,"
but we are still convinced that students can
have the fun and enjoy the traditions that go
with college life and still . . show both with
in and without the University . . . respect for
order, morality, personal honor, and the rights
of others . . ."

So you want to be Stanford men and women
- that is, BIG Stanford men and women—
BMOC's and BWOC's, no less! You've moved
into a small residence, perhaps as a sophomore
if you're a woman; as a freshman or sophomore
if you're a man.
"ff you're a woman you note that those small
residences have an "independent house pol
icy," at least that's what the Women's Housing
Plan says. Isn't that grand! Now you are free;
away from any close adult supervision; you
are no longer a freshman. So you decide that
you will show them you "know it all," perhaps
by having a class party or by taking a sopho
more sneak—older girls in the house have told
you a lot about previous sophomore sneaks.
That v/as the thing to do to show your class
"unity," your house "spirit." Only your sneak
is different:
You don't get up early in the morning, dis
arrange the rooms of upperclassmen, blow a
few horns, or go off for a day of fun with your
class. No, you don't do just those things. In
stead you act your noisiest and rowdiest, be
yond the limits of good taste and decent con
duct, and in doing so you gain the resentment
of all those persons living in small residences
who are concerned about the reputation their
house maintains; the resentment of all those
who have found something of real value in
that "independent house policy" and who are
willing to accept the responsibilities that go
with such a policy.
Having long had faith in the ability of col
lege-age men and v/omen to exercise their own
self-discipline, to govern themselves through
the living group without the necessity of end
loss rules and regulations imposed from the
outside, we are concerned over the obvious
lack of responsibility of a few persons whose
aclions may be detrimental to a whole group.
Sophomore sneaks, class parties, house sere
nades, etc., should be encouraged, we think, but
lately their value has been lessened by the
juvenile attitude that seems to have gone with
such functions. We remember all the argu
ments that "college students in recent years
have been younger on the average," and that
"war-time insecurity has exerted its influence,"
but we are still convinced that students can
