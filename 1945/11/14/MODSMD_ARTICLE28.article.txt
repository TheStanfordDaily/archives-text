### Stanley Wilson 
What a week! . . . First of all, the Grut Comic
Book hits the stands this morning. If we live
through that we can attend the rally tomorrow
evening, and then comes the Gaieties' 1945 pro
duction.
We were interested in the title of one of
the original songs which will be introduced
at the rally. It's a little ditty entitled, "Stan
ford Girls Are Easy to Love." The most in
teresting part of this story is that the song was
v/ritten by a Stanford co-ed. . . . 1 see!

One of my colleagues left a note for me to

day concerning a certain statement issued by
the late Franklin D. Roosevelt on October 21,
1936. It read as follows: "Recovery is with us.
Federal revenues are increasing. Emergency
expenditures qre decreasing. A BALANCED
BUDGET IS ON THE WAY." Did we miss it
when it passed?

I passed a respected member of the Political
Science Department the other day on Quad and
he was obliviously singing to the world some
thing about, "Kiss me once and kiss me twice
and kiss me once again." Really, Doctor! I
always maintained too much time in the throes
of learning would frustrate a man.

And now we notice that another tea is be
ing given lor Dean and Mrs. Stalnaker. Care
lul, Dean, you'll get the habit.

I attended a cocktail party the other day and
became engaged in a conversation with two
ex-Army flyers. They recalled to me the old
gag about the bumblebee not having enough
wing space to be able to fly, according to
aerodynamics. But the bee doesn't know that,
so he flies anyhow. Well, these jokers weren't
satisfied with the marvels of nature, so they
captured a bee, stuck it under a microscope
and examined it, and finished off the experi
ment by building a miniature wind tunnel for
tunning off flight tests on the bug. Sure
enough, the bee can fly, and what's more, he
DOES have sufficient wing space. The boys
said something then about installing jet mech
anisms on a bee so it could travel from flower
to flower all the faster. With this idea they
could equip a couple of thousand and monopo
lize the honey industry. At that point I decided
the drinks had more in them than lemon juice.
I left before I started talking in such circles.
What does the medical journal call it? Flak
happy?
