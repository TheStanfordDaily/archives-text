By Elliot Epsteen
The world still has its battlefields. They are
Manchuria and Indonesia.
In Manchuria, the Nationalists seem to be
trying to unhinge the right end of the Commu
nist "Great Wall" line from its anchor at Shan
haikwan. The Nationalists have massed heavy
forces. The Associated Press reports the Com
munists as being dug into "deep entrench
ments," but no professional observer has ren
dered an opinion on their position, and war
correspondents have tacked that label onto
some of the worst shell traps in history.
SIDELIGHT
A sidelight issue is developing here as to
who fired the first shot. Each side charges the
other. However, since battle here would prob
ably be something more to the advantage of
the Nationalists, since their success v/ould turn
the whole Communist line, the actual honors
probably belong to them.
So far, reports from both sides indicate a
kaleidoscope of attacks and counter-attacks,
with both sides standing pretty much where
they did in the beginning. However, two new
Nationalist armies, largely equipped with
American mechanized equipment, are landing
at the Marine-held beachhead on the Gulf of
Peiiho. They will shortly be in motion to the
front, and their new equipment might deci
sively settle the battle of the Great Wall.
HOPEH BATTLE
The Communist lunge toward the rail lines
feeding the Nationalist armies at the Great
Wall has disappeared from the news. It has
probably died partly of its own weight and
partly because of Nationalist reserves. Consid
ering that the Red advance had to come a long
distance over difficult roads, the defenders had
ample time to deploy themselves. Also, any
gain this Communist push brought was offset
by the intervention of American shipping in
establishing a sea line of communications.
Future actions in Manchuria might deter
mine something about American policy. If the
Nationalists succeed at Sanhaikwan, they will
force an entry into the province by way of the
coast. A number of amphibious landings on
the Communist flanks could be speedily rein
forced by the Nationalists advancing from the
south, and would lever the Communists into a
precipitous retreat in open country and against
superior mechanized forces. In short, such
moves would smash the Communist Manchu
rian wing.
JOKER
But the joker in the question is that the only
way amphibious landings could be effected
would be with American armed aid. So far,
Americans have entered combat zones on the
pretense that they were disarming Japanese.
Those in Manchuria, however, have been taken
care of already by the Russians. Thus, if we
made this move, we would show the world
exactly where we stood on the civil war ques
tion. We could no longer cloak our moves with
any pretenses. But this wouldn't exactly help
the Communists

JOKER
But the joker in the question is that the only
way amphibious landings could be effected
would be with American armed aid. So far,
Americans have entered combat zones on the
pretense that they were disarming Japanese.
Those in Manchuria, however, have been taken
care of already by the Russians. Thus, if we
made this move, we would show the world
exactly where we stood on the civil war ques
tion. We could no longer cloak our moves with
any pretenses. But this wouldn't exactly help
the Communists

The world still has its battlefields. They are
Manchuria and Indonesia.
In Manchuria, the Nationalists seem to be
trying to unhinge the right end of the Commu
nist "Great Wall" line from its anchor at Shan
haikwan. The Nationalists have massed heavy
forces. The Associated Press reports the Com
munists as being dug into "deep entrench
ments," but no professional observer has ren
dered an opinion on their position, and war
correspondents have tacked that label onto
some of the worst shell traps in history.
SIDELIGHT
A sidelight issue is developing here as to
who fired the first shot. Each side charges the
other. However, since battle here would prob
ably be something more to the advantage of
the Nationalists, since their success v/ould turn
the whole Communist line, the actual honors
probably belong to them.
So far, reports from both sides indicate a
kaleidoscope of attacks and counter-attacks,
with both sides standing pretty much where
they did in the beginning. However, two new
Nationalist armies, largely equipped with
American mechanized equipment, are landing
at the Marine-held beachhead on the Gulf of
Peiiho. They will shortly be in motion to the
front, and their new equipment might deci
sively settle the battle of the Great Wall.
HOPEH BATTLE
The Communist lunge toward the rail lines
feeding the Nationalist armies at the Great
Wall has disappeared from the news. It has
probably died partly of its own weight and
partly because of Nationalist reserves. Consid
ering that the Red advance had to come a long
distance over difficult roads, the defenders had
ample time to deploy themselves. Also, any
gain this Communist push brought was offset
by the intervention of American shipping in
establishing a sea line of communications.
Future actions in Manchuria might deter
mine something about American policy. If the
Nationalists succeed at Sanhaikwan, they will
force an entry into the province by way of the
coast. A number of amphibious landings on
the Communist flanks could be speedily rein
forced by the Nationalists advancing from the
south, and would lever the Communists into a
precipitous retreat in open country and against
superior mechanized forces. In short, such
moves would smash the Communist Manchu
rian wing.
