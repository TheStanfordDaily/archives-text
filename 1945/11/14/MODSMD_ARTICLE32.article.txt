To the Editor:
We feel that the present system
of election of freshman class offi
cers is unjust to the candidates but
even more unjust to the electors
who must vote with scant knowl
edge of the candidates' ability or
experience.
This class, because it is split
up, has developed an exaggerated
sectionalism. This sectionalism, in
I iiin, has led to nominations based
on living groups rather than on
individual qualifications. We be
lieve this to be wrong.
No matter who wins, a feeling of
group animosity and a elass split in
three major factions will result.
This should not, but surely will, oc
cur.
The class of '49 is the first
peace-time class, the class that
will be largely responsible for the
transition from war to peace. The
returning veteran has a right to
play bis part in a unified class and
a unified school.
Stanford women have also earned,
by their fine administration of
school affairs during the war years,
a high place in school organization,
a place which a potential minority
in a disunified whole cannot hope
to enjoy.
The recognition of this problem
without any action to remedy it is
asinine. In order to give the voters
a better chance for intelligent vot
ing, not only in A.S.S.U. elections
but also in class elections, we pro
pose:
1. A greater period of time be
tween nomination and election.
2. A series of exchange talks.
Assemblies for the affected
groups.
1. More apparent A.S.S.U. in
terest.
No election is so inconsequential
as not to have an effect on the stu
dent body as a whole.
Because of these aforesaid rea
sons we are afraid that the fine
Stanford spirit evident in the past
is in a process of retrogradationâ€”
e.g., the painfully small sophomore
class turnout and student lack of
interest at the polls. We on the
Farm have exhibited fine football
spirit; where is the Stanford spirit?
We believe it must come from with
in.
