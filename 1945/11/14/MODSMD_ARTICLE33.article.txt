# Bassett to Speak At Biology Meet
## 
### 
David L. Basselt, asssistanl profes
sor of anatomy at Stanford, will
speak on "Cyclical Vascular Changes
in the Rat Ovary" at the biological
science .department's weekly semi
nar at 4:15 p.m. today in room 430 of
Jordan Ilall.
Dr. Bassett is interested in the
study of the way minute blood ves
sels in the rat ovary adapt them
selves to remarkable changes in the
ovarian structure, which recur with
each estrous cycle of four days' du
ration.
Channel Distribution
His studies were made by filling
the blood vessels of the ovary with
India ink and then observing the
distribution of these channels under
the microscope. In addition, the sur
face blood vessels in the ovaries of
living rats were observed under high
magnification, giving a means of
studying the actual blood flow in
these vessels.
Interesting problems concerning
the vascular system arise in connec
tion with such extensive reorganiza
tion of tissue as occurs in the ovary
during the estrous cycle, according
to Dr. Bassett. Among these are
problems of permeability changes,
growth of the capillary walls, and
the stimuli which bring about these
changes.
