# NROTC Training Equipment Creates Actual Conditions
## 
### MARY ANN McCOMB 
Training equipment for the N.R.-
O.T.C. unit here includes an auto
matic question and answer machine,
a planet projector, a range-estimat
ing trainer, and two complete train
ing signal bridges, according to Lt.
Commander Jack W. Hammer, gun
nery officer.
The automatic question and an
swer machine is located in Toyon
Hall where the N.R.O.T.C. students
may use it during their free hours.
To operate the machine, the student
presses a button and a question with
five answers is flashed on the screen.
The student then has 20 seconds to
choose the correct answer. A score
of 200 is possible. Mr. Hammer con
siders this machine a valuable aid
in naval science studies and inter
esting too, because it combines sub
ject matter with the fascination of
a slot machine.
N.R.O.T.C. Armory
The N.R.O.T.C. has an armory in
the basement of the Education
Building. There is located the plan
et projector, an apparatus for sim
ulating the sky as seen from the
deck of a ship. It projects the stars
and planets on a spherical screen.
A training device is also used to
instruct the students in estimating
range by following fast-moving air
planes on a moving picture screen.
The student presses the trigger and
the instrument tabulates and com
pares the estimated range with the

nection with gunnery training.
Signal Bridges
â€¢ According to Mr. Hammer, the
the unit has just received two com
plete signal bridges for training
purposes. One is- to be placed in
the rear of Toyon, and the other at
a considerable distance northeast of
that position. They will be used to
instruct students in communications,
simulating working from the bridges
of two ships.
In addition the unit has just re
ceived 10 target pistols and 10 tar
get rifles which will be used to train
and qualify all students as marks
men. It is expected that a rifle team
will be organized in the near future
for competitive firing with other
N.R.O.T.C. units throughout the
country.
Training Films
In addition to the above equip
ment the unit has working models
of automatic weapons and several
slide film projectors and motion pic
ture projectors with various train
ing films on such topics as seaman
ship, navigation, and gunnery.
N.R.O.T.C. students may major in
almost any course they choose. In
addition they are required to take
certain subjects that will give them
a minor in naval science. The naval
science subjects consist of seaman
ship, damage control, gunnery, na
val engineering, navigation, com
munications, and naval administra
tion. At present seamanship and
commur.ications are the only
courses taught, but the more ad
vanced subjects will be added later.
