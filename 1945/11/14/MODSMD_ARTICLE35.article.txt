### 
PASADENA, Nov. 13 (UP).â€”lm
mediate establishment of a national
atomic-control commission as a step
toward international control of
atomic energy was urged today by
nearly 200 California Institute of
Technology Scientists, including de
velopers of the atomic bomb.
"We believe that scientific facts
cannot be kept secret for long, and
that other nations will discover how
to make atomic bombs within a
few years," they said in an open let
ter to President Truman and the
U.S. Congress.
"Unless that short time is used to
establish international control, an
armament race may ensue with re
sults even more disastrous than
they have been in the past.
"We believe that national con
trol must precede international con
trol. Therefore, a national com
mission should be set up immedi
ately to execute this control."
