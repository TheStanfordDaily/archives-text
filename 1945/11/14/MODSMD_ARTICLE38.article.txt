# Arsenal Chief Back at Farm

### 
After solving some of the Army's
most difficult ordnance problems
during nearly five years of service
at the Rock Island Arsenal, Colonel
Welton J. Crook has returned on
terminal leave and will resume his
duties here as professor of metallur
gy at the beginning of winter quar-
Colonel Crook was officer in j
charge of the engineering depart- |
ment of the arsenal, which is the |
world's largest. His department was
responsible for the design and de- |
velopment of all artillery gun car- I
riages and recoil mechanisms for the j
whole Army.
Oepartmcnt Aids Navy
It also handled such diverse prob
lems as the mounting of cannons on I
airplanes and the development of
steel "paracrates" for air-dropping '
of supplies to troops in isolated \
areas. On occasion it even aided the
Navy by producing gun-loading ma
chines and certain turret mechan
isms on the new super-battleships.
"In addition to solving the imme
diate problems," a commendation
from his superior states, "Colonel
Crook also personally initiated, di
rected and supervised research stud-
J ies connected with metals used in
j gun carriages and recoil mechan
j isms."
"Long Tom '
A typical example outlined by
Colonel Crook was the problem of
developing a satisfatcory carriage
for the "Long Tom." Because of this
cannon's terrific recoil, firing caused
the carriage of the first few models

to collapse. HeavLer steel sections
would have solved the problem, ex
cept that the gun was already as
heavy as could be allowed. Conse
quently, it was necessary to develop
a much stronger plate steel than was
then available. This was done with
the cooperation of one of the large
steel companies.
Kecoilless Artillery
Other interesting assignments in
Colonel Crook's department were the
development of firing mounts for
rockets and the new recoilless artil
lery that came into use shortly he
fore the war's end.
