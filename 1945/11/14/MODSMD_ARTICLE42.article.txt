High-scoring and fancy-playing individuals like Wedemeyer,
Blanchard and Davis are receiving the lion's share of the plaudits
as the current football season rolls along. This is nothing new and
probably is the way it should be since their collective feats do
outshine all other competitors. But as football has all its outstand
ing heroes, so does football have its many unsung heroes.
There is a boy playing first-string left guard for San Francisco
Junior College who is forced to play the game on his hands and
knees. Yes, as a child this fellow was the victim of infantile paral
ysis and now is unable to run or walk by self-support. He likes
football and so when the current season came up, this character
asks for a uniform. Naturally the coach had to go into a confab
v/ith parents and medicos before agreeing with the boy as to
whether he could play. Numerous doctors examined him and all
arrived at identical decisions. Football couldn't hurt him any more
than anyone else. His parents didn't object to his participating
in the game he loves so well, and consequently he got his uni
form. When the Jaycees' first game came up, this left guard
had won himself a starting position. Your reporter saw him play
against the Cal Ramblers and would rate his performance at least
on a par with that of any other player on the field. On a punt or
kickoff which necessitates a long trip down field, he makes his
; way with the support of a teammate's shoulder. Otherwise it's
on his hands and knees to and from huddles.
VETS NOT DISABLED
The Nevada Wolfpack has two men in their present starting
lineup who have truly felt the effects of World War 11. Bobby
Ravera lost his left arm above the wrist when in France, a Nazi
planted land mine v/ent off a little too close. Last summer young
Robert was discharged—he is only eighteen —and enrolled at
Nevada's higher institution of learning. When the call for foot
ball practice was first sounded, Mr. Ravera put in his appearance,
stating that he wanted to try out for fullback. Now if he had been
a perfectly sound-bodied human being, there would still have
been cause for amazement. You see, Bobby tips the scales at only
154. A 154-pound fullback is just a downright contradiction. Then
on top of his deficit in size he wanted to play in the backfield
where the ball-handling business requires nimble fingers—and
this man with but one arm. Ravera didn't make the first string
until the Cal game a few weeks ago—but when the opportunity
was finally presented, he "took off." Final statistics proved his
ground gaining to be tops for the afternoon. To make his "truth
is stranger than fiction" story more unbelievable, he plays safety
on defense.
Ravera has a fellow back who has developed into the team's
outstanding broken-field runner. His name is Jim Taylor. The
war caught up with him hard when he received shrapnel wounds
in both ankles. Now to make the impossible possible, he turns
out to be the fastest sprinter on the squad. The only special equip
ment that he requires is specially built low-cut shoes. My hat's off
to boys like this because they are the ones who really give out
when they play football. When a person is giving everything,
playing under handicap, he is doing far more than the star whose
partial efforts are tops in the final count.

REMEMBER THE DROP KICK?
This game of football once had an art called drop-kicking.
During recent times it had degenerated into a forgotten art until
this season, when a substitute fullback on the Notre Dame team
revived it. The Irish convert after their T.D.'s with Stan Krivak's
drop-kicking. His average isn't the best in the country but there
are few extra-point specialists who have been enjoying better
success. Really, though, one wonders why drop-kicking isn't
practiced more. By eliminating the holder it frees one man for
blocking duties.
It is seldom that a small college player makes the numerous
lists of Ail-American teams that the sports scribes manage to cook
up. One exception is Bob "Buster" McClure, who for the past two
seasons has been giving forth with pigskin services at Nevada.
Last season this 240-pound tackle made most of the top elevens,
and after watching him this year yours truly can see no reason
why he should not repeat. One thing is certain after viewing his
line play: the nickname "Buster" didn't befall him by accident.
Playing alongside Bob as end is another 240-pound chunk of beef,
Max Dodge. Despite all his tonnage, Mr. Dodge gets around right
smartly, and catches enough passes in some games to rival old
Don Hutson. Last Saturday he was on the receiving end of four
touchdown aerials.
It all goes to show that contrary to the customary armchair
coach's ideas, a man's gridiron abilities cannot be judged by
his physical characteristics, natural or unnatural.
