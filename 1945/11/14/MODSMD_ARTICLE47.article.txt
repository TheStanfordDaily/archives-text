# Varsity Footballers Hit Final Workouts
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Varsity football practice has hit
! the home stretch in anticipation of
j this Saturday's tilt with the Stock-
I ton Commandos at 2 p.m. in the
| Stanford Stadium. Coach Marchie
J Schwartz has ordered no more
scrimmage, fearing that some of the
j boys might be injured and not be
j able to play in the week-end game,
| the first tussle for the Stanford foot
! ball eleven in three years. Instead,
all the plays will be polished up,
and the linemen will work on tackle
dummies and pass play formations.
In the short period of three weeks,
the gridiron boys have come a long
way. Marchmont Schwartz is well
pleased with the progress the team
has made, and expects the men in
J the moleskin to put up a good game
} on Saturday. When the first whistle
| was blown, not two men on the
squad knew the first thing about the
T formation, but now the backfields
I are reeling off the tricky and in
-1 tricate runs and passes with the
j precision of a newly oiled watch.
First Eleven Men
The starting lineup has been an
nounced by the coaching staff. In
I the backfield, Curt Burks, a former
: Southern California prep player,
will start at the quarterback post,
i He got the call because of "heads

up" play-calling, and good passing.
At fullback is Fred "Powerhouse"
Willey, who is the hardest line
charger on the field. At the left
halfback post will be Don Lipelt,
who comes via Lodi. He will be
wealing uniform No. 13, the same
number Frankie Albert, the great
All-American quarterback of a few
years back, wore during collegiate
days. Over at the right halfback
post is Gene Martin, who hails from
the corn - growing state of lowa.
According to Marchie Schwartz,
Martin shows promise of develop
ing into a great football player.
The two end posts have been
nailed down by Ric Supple and
Dave DeSwarte, an Illinois im
port to Stanford. Both players
are good pass snaggers, and can
block, too. Supple, besides, has a
gifted toe that boots punts for dis
tance every time. Guard and
tackle spots have gone to Harry
Davison. Jim Fry, Bill Lundquist,
and Les Dyer. All these boys tip
the scales close to the 200-pound
mark. Big Boh Abrams will do
the centering.
The backfield combination of Bill
Larson at quarterback, Tom Ashley
and Willie Altus at the halfback
spots, and Henry Nissen at fullback
is pushing hard for laurels, accord
ing to the coach, and should see a
lot of action this Saturday.
Stockton Football
Stockton, to this date, is still the
unknown quantity. Nobody has any
idea what kind of team they have,
but if records mean anything, the
team is darn good—or at least was
till last Saturday, when they lost to
Compton J.C. By pencil and paper
figures, the grid outfit that has its
home at the Stockton Air Base
ranks on a par with U.S.C., since
both teams lost to St. Mary's by the
same score, 26-0. But since they
played the Moraga gang, a few of
their players have been discharged,
but the team will still provide the
untried Stanford eleven with a siz
zler of a football game. Estimates of
the game are steadily going up, and
a crowd of 25,000 is expected for
the game. There will be no admis
sion, and kick-off time is 2 p.m.

figures, the grid outfit that has its
home at the Stockton Air Base
ranks on a par with U.S.C., since
both teams lost to St. Mary's by the
same score, 26-0. But since they
played the Moraga gang, a few of
their players have been discharged,
but the team will still provide the
untried Stanford eleven with a siz
zler of a football game. Estimates of
the game are steadily going up, and
a crowd of 25,000 is expected for

Varsity football practice has hit
! the home stretch in anticipation of
j this Saturday's tilt with the Stock-
I ton Commandos at 2 p.m. in the
| Stanford Stadium. Coach Marchie
J Schwartz has ordered no more
scrimmage, fearing that some of the
j boys might be injured and not be
j able to play in the week-end game,
| the first tussle for the Stanford foot
! ball eleven in three years. Instead,
all the plays will be polished up,
and the linemen will work on tackle
dummies and pass play formations.
In the short period of three weeks,
the gridiron boys have come a long
way. Marchmont Schwartz is well
pleased with the progress the team
has made, and expects the men in
J the moleskin to put up a good game
} on Saturday. When the first whistle
| was blown, not two men on the
squad knew the first thing about the
T formation, but now the backfields
I are reeling off the tricky and in
-1 tricate runs and passes with the
j precision of a newly oiled watch.
First Eleven Men
The starting lineup has been an
nounced by the coaching staff. In
I the backfield, Curt Burks, a former
: Southern California prep player,
will start at the quarterback post,
i He got the call because of "heads

up" play-calling, and good passing.
At fullback is Fred "Powerhouse"
Willey, who is the hardest line
charger on the field. At the left
halfback post will be Don Lipelt,
who comes via Lodi. He will be
wealing uniform No. 13, the same
number Frankie Albert, the great
All-American quarterback of a few
years back, wore during collegiate
days. Over at the right halfback
post is Gene Martin, who hails from
the corn - growing state of lowa.
According to Marchie Schwartz,
Martin shows promise of develop
ing into a great football player.
The two end posts have been
nailed down by Ric Supple and
Dave DeSwarte, an Illinois im
port to Stanford. Both players
are good pass snaggers, and can
block, too. Supple, besides, has a
gifted toe that boots punts for dis
tance every time. Guard and
tackle spots have gone to Harry
Davison. Jim Fry, Bill Lundquist,
and Les Dyer. All these boys tip
the scales close to the 200-pound
mark. Big Boh Abrams will do
the centering.
The backfield combination of Bill
Larson at quarterback, Tom Ashley
and Willie Altus at the halfback
spots, and Henry Nissen at fullback
is pushing hard for laurels, accord
ing to the coach, and should see a
lot of action this Saturday.
Stockton Football
Stockton, to this date, is still the

but if records mean anything, the
team is darn good—or at least was

Compton J.C. By pencil and paper
