# Regional Major Furthers Pan-American Relations
## 
### 
Ten Farm students are enrolled in the Regional Major in Hispanic
America, the Spanish Department's pet course for "South of the Border"-
minded citizens.
Inaugurated in 1944, the Regional Major sprang out of war relations.
It was established to stimulate "understanding of the geographical and

► political issues of the Latin eoun
! tries.
Three Groups of Study
Under the direction of Ronald
Hilton, associate professor of Ro
manic languages, the regional is
composed of three definite groups
of studies, which in turn are broken
down into definite aspects.
The groups are language, region
al, and elective. The language is
Spanish, and includes pronuncia
tion, composition, conversation, and
literature. In the regional is in
cluded geography, history, and po
litical science. Portuguese is an
elective for all interested in Brazil.
Three Careers
The regional major leads to any
one of three careers: marriage, ped
agogy, or a job with the State De
partment. The latter was accom
plished by a member of the class of
'45, who is at present in the con
sular department in Guatemala City.
Prof. Aurelio M. Espinosa, head
of the Spanish division of the School
of Humanities, gratefully empha
sized the fact that the war is over
by pointing out that there are at
present seven graduate students in
the Spanish department.—Ryall.
