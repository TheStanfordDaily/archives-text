### 
Twenty-six students returned to
ten California campuses this week,
after formulating first plans for the
annual YMCA-YWCA "University
for a week," in a weekend confer
ence at Malibu Beach.
Carol Kellogg, Stanford "Y" rep
resentative to the meeting, returned
to classes yesterday talking ol two
days of stimulating discussion and
meetings, as well as incidental sun
bathing and ocean swims.
"Christian Faith" Theme
"Representatives of the ten schools
centered on 'Christian Faith' as the
theme of the regional YMCA-YWCA
Asilomar conference, to be held in
April," she reported.
After discussing and unifying sug
gestions brought from all campuses,
the program committee voted to
build the April program on four
points: The Christian heritage and
religion, social responsibility, growth
of individuals, and world relatedness.
Suggestions Made
Representatives made suggestions
for the "university" faculty, said
Miss Kellogg, and the group voted
to see if Howard Thurman would be
available as keynote speaker.
"Our first meeting was held Fri
day night," Miss Kellogg reports,
"where we all presented the ideas
of our campus as to the most vital
topics to be discussed in the 1946
conference." Meetings continued un
til Sunday afternoon.
Schools Represented
Among those schools represented
at the joint conference were the
University of Southern California,
U.C.L.A., Pomona, San Bernardino,
Cal, San Jose State, Redlands, Occi
dental, and College of the Pacific.
"One of the most interesting dele
gates was a Cal student, a Japanese-
American," said Miss Kellogg. "He
contributed some very sound ideas
to the discussions."
The conference was held at the
Gunn residence at Malibu Beach.
