### 
Stanford's Cardinals of 1945 will
receive a dashing send-off on their
road to future championships from
one of Stanford's famous "Vow
Boys" of 1933 tomorrow night at
the "Big Indian Rally." Bill Corbus,
a former all-coast and All-Ameri-
I can guard, will appear at the col
orful event in the Pavilion.
Since Farm students will be ob
serving a Stanford football team for
the first time in over two years to
morrow, the rally's co - chairmen,
Ruth Levison and Wally McCall,
asked Corbus to initiate the new
season with a talk at the Pavilion.
Member of Red Machine
As a member of one of Stanford's
great "Red Machines," Corbus has
seen many enthusiastic rallies on
the campus. Rally Com members

will equal any previous noise and
enthusiasm shown at a pre-game
Farm rally.
It was Bill Corbus who, in 1933,
helped the "Vow Boys" make good
their promise never to be defeated
by U.S.C. In the fourth quarter of
the game, with the score tied at 7-7,
this unanimous choice for All-
American scored two field goals
which won the game for the Cardi
nals.
