# Prewar-Style Rooting Section To Cheer for Cards Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's rooting section will be
out in pre-war style for Saturday's
football game with the Stockton
Commandos.
Rally Com has announced that
no one will be admitted into the
organized Indian rooting section
Saturday unless they wear the
prescribed white shirts and white
j sweaters.
In former times the rooting section
was one of the most colorful in the
world. The men occupied the large
center section and the women, with
their red and white pom-poms, sat
on either side.
i Pom-I'oms Shredded
When the Stanford band played
Farm songs, the women would wave
j their pom-poms in rhythm. During
| exciting plays the women would in-
J variably break the pom-pom sticks
i and by the last game of the season,
j most were torn io shreds.
Enthusiasm has always been the
I keynote of the Stanford rooters.
| Whether the game was played in
I Los Angeles, Berkeley, or fog-bound
j Kezar, Stanford rooters were always
; there to yell the team on.
The Stanford band will play for
| the game Saturday. They have been
j practicing up on the Indian songs
| and will be able to give forth with
, all the Farm favorites.
First Game in Three Years
The Stockton game will be the
first that the Indians have played in
three years. They ended their last
season, the 1042 season, on an opti
mistic note when they defeated Ore
gon State. 49-13; California, 2G-7,
and St. Mary's Preflight, 28-13.
It is expected that a crowd of
from 15,000 to 25,000 will turn out
to see the Indian team return to
the Coast football scene. Admis
sion to the game is free.
No card stunts will be used at the
! game Saturday, Rally Com has an
| nounced. Instead the card stunts will
j not be used until the opening game
I of the 1946 season.
! Outcome Unknown
What can be expected of the Car-

j dinal team is unknown. Local dope
i sters have given the Indians the edge
: despite their inexperience. Stockton
| will come into the Stadium with a
good team that boasts a 27-0 victory
over McClellan Field. Earlier in the
season the Stockton boys lost to St.
Mary's, 26-0, not exactly a disgrace.
Southern California lost by the same
score two weeks ago to the Gaels.
All alumni in the Bay Area arc
urged to come down to the Farm
for the Stockton game. The game
Saturday will go a long way in de
termining what kind of a team
Stanford will field in 194(>.
Here at Stanford enthusiasm is
, growing as game time approaches.
! Key word of the Farm rooters is
! "Beat Stockton!" The team will be
I introduced to the ASSU at the all
campus rally Thursday night in the
I Pavilion.
| Post-Game Entertainment
Stanford's first football weekend
in three years will be climaxed by
the Gaieties and various open houses
after the game. Most of the Row
houses will have open house to the
campus and to old returning alumni.
Football spirit, which was dead
during the war, prevails over the
campus. For the first time in three
years, Stanford has a team of its
own to root for. Enthusiasm will
reach a peak at the Rally and then
at the game Saturday.
The squad that will trot out onto
the Stadium turf Saturday will have
fine turf to play on. Stanford Sta
dium has always had the reputation
of being the finest anywhere. The
; turf is in good condition after three
! years of football-less seasons.
I Programs Passed Out
Programs will be passed out at the
I Stadium with numbers of all the
players. The loud-speaker system
will be operating so that everyone
will know which guy from Eneina
: just made that ten-yard gain.
Around the Farm now they're
i no longer saying, "See 'ya on
j Quad" —it's "See 'ya at the game
i Saturday!"— Peck
