## 
### 
Kxrom agreed last night »c> conduct n student poll tomorrow through
the Daily asking support of a petition to be sent to Congress urging h
hold and responsible step toward international control of atomic energy.
A.S.S.U. Vice-President Charmian Kolar, Excom members Gloria
Anderson, Betty Wellington, and Fred Bremenkamp will consult with
interested faculty members in drawing lip a statement lliat will appear
in tomorrow's Daily in ballot form. Student replies on these ballots will
be collected through the living groups.
Letters from Bennington and Welleslcy Colleges received at Stanford
urged immediate student, petition to Congress, saying, "Unless the facilities
for producing and using this weapon are placed under effective interna
tional control, the Great Powers of the world will develop them in a vain
search for security and will run blindly into another war.
"This would spell catastrophe for the world in which we are living and
destroy all of our hopes for the future. We are certain that you and
your fellow students are as deeply concerned with this challenge as the
people at our college."
WELLESLEY—WORLD FEDERATION
"A world federation above national sovereignty is our one hope for
an orderly world. Every able individual must work toward such a federa
tion with a total miracle of energy comparable to that which produced the
bomb," read Welleslcy's letter.
"Our statesmen cannot act until they have the people of the country
behind them. If people of this country rise for a World Federation it
may come in two years, in Ift years, in 20 years. It is mankind's hope."
Excom felt that student opinion on this matter, voiced through the pro
posed petition, was important not only in its immediate import in Wash
ington, but secondarily in its awakening the student mind to an under
standing of the complex state of the world today—of the sudden ineffec
tiveness of its diplomacy and organization.
STUDENT OPINION NEEDED
Since the universities of the world are supposedly the breeding place
of its future leaders, any expression of student judgment in its affairs
is not given in vain, Excdm felt. Experts have voiced their opinions for
nations to hear; student opinion, equally important, should also be heard
in the most effective manner possible.
The Daily for October 2!) was devoted almost entirely to the question
of the atomic bomb, and recommendations for its control. President
Donald Tresidder, Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur, Graham Stuart, I).
Elton Trucblood, Paul Kirkpatrick and Harold Fisher presented their
opinions before the student body through personal intcrvncws.
Further student action may be taken through individual letters to their
Congressmen, petitions of a similar nature, forums or informal meetings
to formulate opinions, and further studies into the situation now existent.
Excom urges all students to vote in tomorrow's poll, considering this
problem one of the primary considerations of any citizen in the world
today.

A.S.S.U. Vice-President Charmian Kolar, Excom members Gloria
Anderson, Betty Wellington, and Fred Bremenkamp will consult with
interested faculty members in drawing lip a statement lliat will appear
in tomorrow's Daily in ballot form. Student replies on these ballots will
be collected through the living groups.
Letters from Bennington and Welleslcy Colleges received at Stanford
urged immediate student, petition to Congress, saying, "Unless the facilities
for producing and using this weapon are placed under effective interna
tional control, the Great Powers of the world will develop them in a vain
search for security and will run blindly into another war.
"This would spell catastrophe for the world in which we are living and
destroy all of our hopes for the future. We are certain that you and
your fellow students are as deeply concerned with this challenge as the
people at our college."
WELLESLEY—WORLD FEDERATION
"A world federation above national sovereignty is our one hope for
an orderly world. Every able individual must work toward such a federa
tion with a total miracle of energy comparable to that which produced the
bomb," read Welleslcy's letter.
"Our statesmen cannot act until they have the people of the country
behind them. If people of this country rise for a World Federation it
may come in two years, in Ift years, in 20 years. It is mankind's hope."
Excom felt that student opinion on this matter, voiced through the pro
posed petition, was important not only in its immediate import in Wash
ington, but secondarily in its awakening the student mind to an under
standing of the complex state of the world today—of the sudden ineffec
tiveness of its diplomacy and organization.
STUDENT OPINION NEEDED
Since the universities of the world are supposedly the breeding place
of its future leaders, any expression of student judgment in its affairs
is not given in vain, Excdm felt. Experts have voiced their opinions for
nations to hear; student opinion, equally important, should also be heard
in the most effective manner possible.

of the atomic bomb, and recommendations for its control. President
Donald Tresidder, Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur, Graham Stuart, I).
Elton Trucblood, Paul Kirkpatrick and Harold Fisher presented their
opinions before the student body through personal intcrvncws.
Further student action may be taken through individual letters to their
Congressmen, petitions of a similar nature, forums or informal meetings
to formulate opinions, and further studies into the situation now existent.
Excom urges all students to vote in tomorrow's poll, considering this
problem one of the primary considerations of any citizen in the world
today.
