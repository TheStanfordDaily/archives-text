# Big Red Machine Rolls Tonight
## 
### 
The Indian is on the march again!
Tonight's "Big Indian Rally" in the
Pavilion marks the end of over two
years of a teamless Stanford. The
student body will parade in a torch
light procession, beginning at Bu
chanan at 7, and the campus will
once more see a "Big Red Machine"
take its bow.
Coach Marehie Schwartz will in
troduce the post-war Cardinal team
to the students at the climax of the
rally. Saturday's starting line-up
for the Stanford-Stockton Comman
do game will be on hand to bring
back a tradition of Red and White
football spirit.
Rally Com Plans Stunts
Members of the newly reorganized
Rally Com are having their first
chance to unify the campus tonight,
and they promise to give the stu

dents and team a colorful send-ofT
on the road back to Conference
games.
Many original, ingenious stunts
are planned for the "Big Indian Ral
ly," according to the rally's chair
men, Ruth Levison and Wally Mc-
Call. Some of the ideas have not
been announced to the student body,
but reports show that tonight will
be a fitting introduction to post
war Farm activities.
Bill Corbus, Stanford's AII-Amer
ican member of the "Vow Boys" in
1933, will appear at the Pavilion to
night. His talk will usher in the
new era of an athletic Farm.
Yells, Original Songs
Cheer leaders Newt Arnold, Bill
Lippincott, and Charles Jackman
promise to top all previous yells
with the now enthusiasm produced

by the return of football to the cam
pus. Two songs dedicated to the
Farm and written by a Stanford stu
dent, Betty Steller, will be presented
tonight.
One of these tunes, "Stanford
Girls Are Easy to Love," will be
sung by a trio, Marky Clcek, Guyla
Runyon, and Joan Bailey. Jack
Taylor will introduce the other song,
which is in honor of returning vet
erans, "The Return of the Stanford
Rough."
Two Bands Ready
Two bands, not the usual one, will
perform at the "Big Indian Rally."
"Mad Ben Bok and His Boys" will
lead the torch-light procession
mounted on a truck. McCall reports
that the group will start the parade
with all the flash and blare appro
priate at a rally.
When the procession reaches the
Pavilion, the regular Stanford band
will take over with the fight songs
which, once again, will be sung with
a purpose. The parade will stop at
the post office while Rally Com
members escort Roblc, Lagunita,
and Ventura residents to the pro
cession. Students are requested not

to bring cars into the parade be
cause of (ho danger caused at the
last rally by reckless drivers.
Noise-Makers Welcome
Miss Lcvison and McCall ask stu
dents to bring cow-bells or any
other noise-making machines to the
rally. The louder the racket, the
better, they state. Every Stanford
student is urged to appear at the
rally with all the spirit which has
been pent up for the past three
years and "give the Model T a
push."
Pre-War Stunts Organized
Rally Com has warned the .stu
dent body that only people wear
ing white sweaters or white shirts
will be permitted to sit in the or
ganized rooting section at Saturday's
game with the Stockton Comman
dos. Head Yell Leader Newt Ar
nold and Rally Com have planned
pre-war stunts for the Farm's first
game.
The reorganized activity commit
tee, wearing new white sweaters,
will usher at the torch-light, parade,
tonight's rally, and the game Sat
urday. Rally Com expects the en
tire student body to boost the "Biy
Indian Rally" and the Cardinal
game with the same spirit that the
campus has only remembered for
the last years.
Army, Navy Invited
Miss Levison and McCall issue
special invitations to the Army and
Navy students on campus to back
the new post-war activities. The
Farm will have one more chance to
back the Red Machine this quarter
at the Merchant Marine game on
December 1.
