# Farm Team Perfects Formations

### 
Football fever is soaring higher
and higher as game time approaches
for the Saturday till with the Stock
ton Commandos. •
Marchie Schwartz, head football
man, is putting the squad through
their final workuut.s. The tricky T
formation plays arc being perfected,
and Stanford students will see a
well coordinated football team op
erating Saturday, despite the fact
that practice has been going on for
only three weeks.
The haekfield is .showing im
provement every day. Curt Burks,
the shifty little quarterback, i~»
really developing into a fine littlr
signal caller. And his passing is as
accurate as a Garand rifle. Fred
Willey has as much power as a
steam engine when he tears
through the line from his fullback
post, and Don l.ipelt and Gene
Martin at the halfback posts
ought to reel off sizeable gains,
100.
On the line such men as Boh
Abrams, Bill Lundquist, Harry Da
vison, and Ric Supple have showed
particularly well, and it is doubtful
if Stockton will be ahle to score
through a ground attack.
This team might be a far cry from
the pre-war Big Red Machines that
contained such grid luminaries as
Ernie Nevers, Bill Corbus, or Fran
kie Albert, but it will be a start on
the return Stanford must make to
resume its position on the football
horizon of collegiate competition.
The Stockton Commandos are
flying down Saturday morning.
They arc also bringing a US-piece
band with them to add color to
the festivities of the afternoon.
They have played nine games this
year, have won two, tied two, and
lost five. The defeated teams on
their list are Amos Alonzo Stagg's
College of Pacific eleven and Mc-
Clelland Field. They have suf
fered losses at the hands of the
Santa Barbara Marines, St. Ma
ry's, Mintcr Field, Pendleton Ma
rines, and Compton J.C. The
teams (hat stood on a par wbh
(hem were Cainp Bcalc and Al
bany Navy.
Their ace baekfield man i Mob
Krieger. Krieger played for Dart
mouth in the late '.'iO's, and when he
got his sheepskin be started play
ing for the Philadelphia Eagles in
the play-for-pay circuit. (Krieger
played against Stanford in the".V.)
Dartmouth game.)
Game time is set for 2 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon. There will be no

Football fever is soaring higher
and higher as game time approaches
for the Saturday till with the Stock
ton Commandos. •
Marchie Schwartz, head football
man, is putting the squad through
their final workuut.s. The tricky T
formation plays arc being perfected,
and Stanford students will see a
well coordinated football team op
erating Saturday, despite the fact
that practice has been going on for
only three weeks.
The haekfield is .showing im
provement every day. Curt Burks,
the shifty little quarterback, i~»
really developing into a fine littlr
signal caller. And his passing is as
accurate as a Garand rifle. Fred
Willey has as much power as a
steam engine when he tears
through the line from his fullback
post, and Don l.ipelt and Gene
Martin at the halfback posts
ought to reel off sizeable gains,
100.
On the line such men as Boh
Abrams, Bill Lundquist, Harry Da
vison, and Ric Supple have showed
particularly well, and it is doubtful
if Stockton will be ahle to score
through a ground attack.
This team might be a far cry from
the pre-war Big Red Machines that
contained such grid luminaries as
Ernie Nevers, Bill Corbus, or Fran
kie Albert, but it will be a start on
the return Stanford must make to
resume its position on the football
horizon of collegiate competition.
The Stockton Commandos are
flying down Saturday morning.
They arc also bringing a US-piece
band with them to add color to
the festivities of the afternoon.
They have played nine games this
year, have won two, tied two, and
lost five. The defeated teams on
their list are Amos Alonzo Stagg's
College of Pacific eleven and Mc-
Clelland Field. They have suf
fered losses at the hands of the
Santa Barbara Marines, St. Ma
