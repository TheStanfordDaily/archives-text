## Squeeze Play 
### 
The Labor-Management Conference contin
ues, and Labor says records show that cor
porate profits have been higher than ever be
fore during the war period, and will continue
to r ■>; therefore Management can afford to pay
higher wages. Management says there is no
reasc 1 to expect that corporate profits will re
main high, that it is "easier to increase wages
than k luce them," and that a large reserve
fund i;; needed for reconversion and to guard
against the day of lower profits. And in be
tv/eon the two Labor and Big Business—is the
small businessman, who had a hard enough
time keeping above board during the war, but
now seems destined to bear an even greater
burden, one which in many cases could put
him out of the running altogether.
Take automobiles, for example: Labor asks
higher wages, government policy offers no as
:;u i. ace of an increase in automobile prices,
and P.'ice Administrator Chester Bowles talks
i,bout reducing prices by chopping in two the
dealer's margin. The House Small Business
Committee has asked Bowles to delay, for they
see that the measure may put a majority of
de. lers out of business, but the delay is only
temporary. The American people's choice in
tho matter is clear: Either they maintain that
r-yslrm in which free competition has kept
down automobile prices, while progressively
giving more and more for the money; or they
bottlr it all up with the imposition of arbitrary
and c rtificial price regulation, which may end
up by a total squeezing out of much small
business.
