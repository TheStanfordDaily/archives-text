# In the Streets of Soerabaja

### 
Where are the wishful thinkers who believe
I hot colonialism has a place in the world?
They are calmly reading their newspapers
ioday, reading of the Nationalist revolt against
Dutch rule in Indonesia, where some people
wouid rather die mean and unheralded deaths
under the treads of British and Dutch tanks than
accept a life of "loyal" subjugation to the
guardians of the Netherlands Indies' wealth of
natural resources. And yet we still hear these
readers say that it is the privilege, even the
right, of imperialists of another age to exploit
peoples of the Far East and retain their political
and economic grip on such regions as Indo
nesia.
The Indonesian uprisings bring to the spot
light for America the entire ironical situation of
colonialism extolled in a world where a domi
nant and victorious group of nations have set
up the mechanics for international settlement
of disputes, and pledged themselves in the pre
amble to the United Nations Charter "to ensure,
by the acceptance of principles and the institu
tion of methods, that armed force shall not be
used, save in the common interest, and to em
ploy international machinery for the promotion
of the economic and social advancement of all
peoples."
The terrible inconsistencies of word and ac
tion become more clear to us by the day, and
whether we like it or not, we must recognize
that the colonial problem is one of the many

which will have to be faced honestly before
the United Nations Organization can be con
sidered effective.
Outright rebellion, such as that of the East
Indies Nationalists, may sometimes be fanati
cal and unrepresentative of the majority, but it
certainly does not spring from a group which
has been assured of fundamental human rights.
Even blindfolded by our sympathy for the
Netherlands which suffered heavily during the
war, we must realize that no people revolt
without cause, and that no people are willing
to fight in the streets of Soerabaja against in
evitably conquering opposition if they do not
hope that a larger sphere, disinterested in mon
etary and political gains—the United Nations
as a body -will recognize their ambitions for
freedom.
Not long from now, our wishful thinkers will
be smiling in satisfaction as they read that the
Indonesian rebellion has been quelled. The
probability is that no compromise granting full
representation in government to the Nationalists
will be reached, let alone an agreement for
eventual establishment of an independent In
donesian republic. 112 The possibility that Dutch
economic interests could be sustained without
the injustices of the present colonial system
will undoubtedly receive no consideration at
all.
Conflicting tides of loyalty wash over the
United States in the meantime; we are besieged
on the one hand by our close ties with our al
lies, and on the other by the bonds of mutual
purpose—liberty—which the colonial peoples
hold up to us. Yet if we have learned to recog
nize the enemy, "greed," in his guise of "friend
ly and profitable relationships between mother
country and colony" as imperialistic exploita
tion, we will be the first to ask that the United
Nations take immediate and constructive action
eliminating present inequities, and leading to
ward the eventual overthrow of all forms of
colonialism.—N. S.

peoples."
The terrible inconsistencies of word and ac
tion become more clear to us by the day, and
whether we like it or not, we must recognize
that the colonial problem is one of the many

which will have to be faced honestly before
the United Nations Organization can be con
sidered effective.
Outright rebellion, such as that of the East
Indies Nationalists, may sometimes be fanati
cal and unrepresentative of the majority, but it
certainly does not spring from a group which
has been assured of fundamental human rights.
Even blindfolded by our sympathy for the
Netherlands which suffered heavily during the
war, we must realize that no people revolt
without cause, and that no people are willing
to fight in the streets of Soerabaja against in
evitably conquering opposition if they do not
hope that a larger sphere, disinterested in mon
etary and political gains—the United Nations
as a body -will recognize their ambitions for
freedom.
Not long from now, our wishful thinkers will
be smiling in satisfaction as they read that the
Indonesian rebellion has been quelled. The
probability is that no compromise granting full
representation in government to the Nationalists
will be reached, let alone an agreement for
eventual establishment of an independent In
donesian republic. 112 The possibility that Dutch
economic interests could be sustained without
the injustices of the present colonial system
will undoubtedly receive no consideration at
all.
Conflicting tides of loyalty wash over the
United States in the meantime; we are besieged
on the one hand by our close ties with our al
lies, and on the other by the bonds of mutual
purpose—liberty—which the colonial peoples
hold up to us. Yet if we have learned to recog
nize the enemy, "greed," in his guise of "friend
ly and profitable relationships between mother
country and colony" as imperialistic exploita
tion, we will be the first to ask that the United
Nations take immediate and constructive action
eliminating present inequities, and leading to
ward the eventual overthrow of all forms of
colonialism.—N. S.
Where are the wishful thinkers who believe
I hot colonialism has a place in the world?
They are calmly reading their newspapers
ioday, reading of the Nationalist revolt against
Dutch rule in Indonesia, where some people
wouid rather die mean and unheralded deaths
under the treads of British and Dutch tanks than
accept a life of "loyal" subjugation to the
guardians of the Netherlands Indies' wealth of
natural resources. And yet we still hear these
readers say that it is the privilege, even the
right, of imperialists of another age to exploit
peoples of the Far East and retain their political
and economic grip on such regions as Indo
nesia.
The Indonesian uprisings bring to the spot
light for America the entire ironical situation of
colonialism extolled in a world where a domi
nant and victorious group of nations have set
up the mechanics for international settlement
of disputes, and pledged themselves in the pre
amble to the United Nations Charter "to ensure,
by the acceptance of principles and the institu
tion of methods, that armed force shall not be
used, save in the common interest, and to em
ploy international machinery for the promotion
of the economic and social advancement of all
peoples."
