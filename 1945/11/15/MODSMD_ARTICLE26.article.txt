# Bull Session

### Stanley Wilson 
I had an interesting informal interview with
Dean Stalnaker on Tuesday, and several sub
jects of pertinence came out in the discussion
which I feel should be forwarded to the Stan
ford students.
First of all, the Dean has been accused in
some circles as opposing such normal campus
activities as sophomore sneaks, serenading of
the small living groups and other such harm
less exhibitions of traditions we like to indulge
in.
The Dean made it clear that such activities
do not run counter to his policy. The only time
Dean Stalnaker will object to these elements is
when they endanger property or lives. Such a
policy is necessary in a University such as
Stanford for a smooth-running organization and
for the actual protection of the students.
The Dean wished further to emphasize the
fact that he is here for the benefit of bettering
conditions for the students — both men and
women. If any problems arise which perplex
us, it is our privilege to seek out the solution
through his office. The latter is open to any
student registered here and is considered the
desirable and most expedient manner of ap
proach. Wo must appreciate a man who is
willing to talk over our problems and make
definite decisions wiihout putting us off. Let's
make use of this opportunity instead of initi
ating and aggravating rumors. It's the logical
and intelligent approach.

Because I am a member of the coveted Daily
staff it would be a blunder of professional eti
guette to say anything good about the most
recent publication of that campus humor (?)
magazine. I forget its name but you probably
saw some venders trying desperately to give
it away with free cartons of cigarettes yester
day. And it worked with some of the weaker
members of the student body.
At any rate I had nothing better to do in my
10 o'clock class so I thumbed through the first
page or two, looking mainly at the advertising.
I was surprised to find that it wasn't a bad
sheet and credit should go to Dick Fayram,
now doing graduate work at Cal Tech, for pro
ducing it in what turned out to be virtually a
one-man job.
(I just yelled across to the Journalism build
ing, where some of the above mentioned self
named comics are working on next month's
edition of the Yellow Peril, and they tell me
they refer to their periodical offspring as the
Chaparral. Thanks, fellas.)
Tonight is our first rally for something be
sides a Lathrop-Hurlburt volleyball game, and
it looks good—tonight's affair, I mean. Com
plete with two bands, three yell leaders, 3,000
Indians and Vow Boy Bill Corbus, the thing's a
natural. I just wish they would straighten me
out on that coach yell, though. By the time I'm
through yelling "Coash, Coash Marshee, Coash
Marshee Schwarsh," I feel like I've either been
eating mush for a week or I've been on a two
day beer bout.

eating mush for a week or I've been on a two
day beer bout.
I had an interesting informal interview with
Dean Stalnaker on Tuesday, and several sub
jects of pertinence came out in the discussion
which I feel should be forwarded to the Stan
ford students.
First of all, the Dean has been accused in
some circles as opposing such normal campus
activities as sophomore sneaks, serenading of
the small living groups and other such harm
less exhibitions of traditions we like to indulge
in.
The Dean made it clear that such activities
do not run counter to his policy. The only time
Dean Stalnaker will object to these elements is
when they endanger property or lives. Such a
policy is necessary in a University such as
Stanford for a smooth-running organization and
for the actual protection of the students.
The Dean wished further to emphasize the
fact that he is here for the benefit of bettering
conditions for the students — both men and
women. If any problems arise which perplex
us, it is our privilege to seek out the solution
through his office. The latter is open to any
student registered here and is considered the
desirable and most expedient manner of ap
proach. Wo must appreciate a man who is
willing to talk over our problems and make
definite decisions wiihout putting us off. Let's
make use of this opportunity instead of initi
ating and aggravating rumors. It's the logical
and intelligent approach.

Because I am a member of the coveted Daily
staff it would be a blunder of professional eti
guette to say anything good about the most
recent publication of that campus humor (?)
magazine. I forget its name but you probably
saw some venders trying desperately to give
it away with free cartons of cigarettes yester
day. And it worked with some of the weaker
members of the student body.
At any rate I had nothing better to do in my
10 o'clock class so I thumbed through the first
page or two, looking mainly at the advertising.
I was surprised to find that it wasn't a bad
sheet and credit should go to Dick Fayram,
now doing graduate work at Cal Tech, for pro
ducing it in what turned out to be virtually a
one-man job.
(I just yelled across to the Journalism build
ing, where some of the above mentioned self
named comics are working on next month's
edition of the Yellow Peril, and they tell me
they refer to their periodical offspring as the
Chaparral. Thanks, fellas.)
Tonight is our first rally for something be
sides a Lathrop-Hurlburt volleyball game, and
it looks good—tonight's affair, I mean. Com
plete with two bands, three yell leaders, 3,000
Indians and Vow Boy Bill Corbus, the thing's a
natural. I just wish they would straighten me
out on that coach yell, though. By the time I'm
through yelling "Coash, Coash Marshee, Coash
Marshee Schwarsh," I feel like I've either been
eating mush for a week or I've been on a two
day beer bout.
