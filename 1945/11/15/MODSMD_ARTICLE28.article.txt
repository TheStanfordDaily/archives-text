# Farm Librarian Recalls Early History of Library
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
The Stanford Library—imposing
white columns, numerous collections
totaling 800,000 books, and all the
staff, space and system necessary to
a modern university library—used
to be a collection of about 8,000
books housed on Inner Quad, where
the Law Library is now, and where
the men sat on one side of the room
and the wOmen on the other.
Only the Inner Quad buildings
were standing when Alice Newman
Hays came to Stanford on the open
ing day in 1891 where she has since
remained as Associate Librarian and
honorary Curator of Stanfordiana,
of which she is now emeritus.
Ilecalls Early Stanford
Besides the Inner Quad there
were Encina, the men's gym, Roble
Hall (now Sequoia), the women's
gym in what is now Woodpecker
Lodge, part of the Museum and a
few engineering buildings. Faculty
"cottages," as Mrs. Stanford called
them, were scattered around in the
fields which were being plowed.
It evidently rained as hard then as
now, and a cement walk led .from
Roble to Encina and a plank walk
from Roble to Quad. Roble. had a
special set. of reference books for
the use of the diligent freshman
women.
Original Collection
Students, then as now, handled

| the loaning out of the books, many
I of which the young and enthusiastic
faculty had loaned from their own
collections, brought when they came
with Dr. David Starr Jordan to help
start the new University.
Of that original collection the sec
ond book of which a record was
made was a book on fishes by Dr.
Jordan, and it is still in the posses
sion of the library.
Moved to Outer Quad
In 1900 the library was moved to
Outer Quad, then being constructed,
into what is now the Administration
building. The reading room was the
lobby where registration now takes
place. The reference room was in
the Dean of Women's present spot
and the periodical room whore Dean
Stalnaker's office is.
The day of moving to this new
location, which was called the
Thomas Welton Stanford Library,
was, Miss Hays said, almost a gen
eral University holiday. Everyone
helped carry books and file them.
Stanford Spirit
This was, she continued, in keep
ing with the spirit of co-operation
and simplicity which she believes
has been typical of Stanford, despite
its growth, since the days when Dr.
Jordan's great figure walked the
campus.
He and his friends brought the
Stanford spirit and vision to the new
! Western University founded out of
| the sorrow and love of Leland and
| Jane Lathrop Stanford. Miss Hays
said.
! Destroyed in Earthquake
The financial discouragements fol
lowing Senator Stanford's death did
not prevent the growth of the Uni
versity and its libraries. Mrs. Stan
lord lived to see the library building
she d ?sired almost completed, but it
was destroyed in the earthquake of
I 13QG and they remained very con
! tentedly in the Thomas Welton
I Stanford location until 1919, Miss
Hays commented.
When the present Stanford Li
j brary building was opened in 1919
| it was one of the most up-to-date
| and convenient in the country from
| the librarian's point of view, but was
I built without knowledge of sound
j proofing, she said, and ventilation
I was a problem as it is in all large
buildings.
Jewel Fund
Something Stanford students may
j not have noticed, Miss Hays said, is
I a bookplate in certain library books
[ It shows a woman kneeling at the
| feet of Minerva offering her a string
jof jewels. Books with this plate in
i them have been purchased by the
Jewel Fund, which is the income
from the jewels sold by Mrs. Stan
ford when the University was in
f'ina n cia 1 d i fficu 11 i es.
The entire Stanford Library today
includes various divisions such as
I the Hoover Library on War, Rcvo-
I lution and Peace, founded by Her
j bert Hoover, '95, and others, the
! Lane Medical Library, the Law Li-
I brary, the Hopkins Marine Library
and the department libraries.
Six Floors of Books
In the Main Library there are six
1 floors of books, which may be ob
-1 tained at the main loan desk, the
references and periodical rooms, the
j Reserve Book Room, the Timothy
| Hopkins room, the drama and other
| special collections, the Engineering
library, the offices of library officials
and employees, and study rooms for
faculty members.

I lution and Peace, founded by Her
j bert Hoover, '95, and others, the
! Lane Medical Library, the Law Li-
I brary, the Hopkins Marine Library
and the department libraries.
Six Floors of Books
In the Main Library there are six
1 floors of books, which may be ob
-1 tained at the main loan desk, the
references and periodical rooms, the
j Reserve Book Room, the Timothy
| Hopkins room, the drama and other
| special collections, the Engineering
library, the offices of library officials
and employees, and study rooms for
faculty members.
The Stanford Library—imposing
white columns, numerous collections
totaling 800,000 books, and all the
staff, space and system necessary to
a modern university library—used
to be a collection of about 8,000
books housed on Inner Quad, where
the Law Library is now, and where
the men sat on one side of the room
and the wOmen on the other.
Only the Inner Quad buildings
were standing when Alice Newman
Hays came to Stanford on the open
ing day in 1891 where she has since
remained as Associate Librarian and
honorary Curator of Stanfordiana,
of which she is now emeritus.
Ilecalls Early Stanford
Besides the Inner Quad there
were Encina, the men's gym, Roble
Hall (now Sequoia), the women's
gym in what is now Woodpecker
Lodge, part of the Museum and a
few engineering buildings. Faculty
"cottages," as Mrs. Stanford called
them, were scattered around in the
fields which were being plowed.
It evidently rained as hard then as
now, and a cement walk led .from
Roble to Encina and a plank walk
from Roble to Quad. Roble. had a
special set. of reference books for
the use of the diligent freshman
women.
Original Collection
Students, then as now, handled

| the loaning out of the books, many
I of which the young and enthusiastic
faculty had loaned from their own
collections, brought when they came
with Dr. David Starr Jordan to help
start the new University.
Of that original collection the sec
ond book of which a record was
made was a book on fishes by Dr.
Jordan, and it is still in the posses
sion of the library.
Moved to Outer Quad
In 1900 the library was moved to
Outer Quad, then being constructed,
into what is now the Administration
building. The reading room was the
lobby where registration now takes
place. The reference room was in
the Dean of Women's present spot
and the periodical room whore Dean
Stalnaker's office is.
The day of moving to this new
location, which was called the
Thomas Welton Stanford Library,
was, Miss Hays said, almost a gen
eral University holiday. Everyone
helped carry books and file them.
Stanford Spirit
This was, she continued, in keep
ing with the spirit of co-operation
and simplicity which she believes
has been typical of Stanford, despite
its growth, since the days when Dr.
Jordan's great figure walked the
campus.
He and his friends brought the
Stanford spirit and vision to the new
! Western University founded out of
| the sorrow and love of Leland and
| Jane Lathrop Stanford. Miss Hays
said.
! Destroyed in Earthquake
The financial discouragements fol
lowing Senator Stanford's death did
not prevent the growth of the Uni
versity and its libraries. Mrs. Stan
lord lived to see the library building
she d ?sired almost completed, but it
was destroyed in the earthquake of
I 13QG and they remained very con
! tentedly in the Thomas Welton
I Stanford location until 1919, Miss
Hays commented.
When the present Stanford Li
j brary building was opened in 1919
| it was one of the most up-to-date
| and convenient in the country from
| the librarian's point of view, but was
I built without knowledge of sound
j proofing, she said, and ventilation
I was a problem as it is in all large
buildings.
Jewel Fund
Something Stanford students may
j not have noticed, Miss Hays said, is
I a bookplate in certain library books
[ It shows a woman kneeling at the
| feet of Minerva offering her a string
jof jewels. Books with this plate in
i them have been purchased by the
Jewel Fund, which is the income
from the jewels sold by Mrs. Stan
ford when the University was in
f'ina n cia 1 d i fficu 11 i es.

from the jewels sold by Mrs. Stan

The entire Stanford Library today
includes various divisions such as
I the Hoover Library on War, Rcvo-
I lution and Peace, founded by Her

and the department libraries.
Six Floors of Books
In the Main Library there are six
1 floors of books, which may be ob
-1 tained at the main loan desk, the
references and periodical rooms, the
j Reserve Book Room, the Timothy
| Hopkins room, the drama and other
| special collections, the Engineering
library, the offices of library officials
and employees, and study rooms for
faculty members.
The Stanford Library—imposing
white columns, numerous collections
totaling 800,000 books, and all the
staff, space and system necessary to
a modern university library—used
to be a collection of about 8,000
books housed on Inner Quad, where
the Law Library is now, and where
the men sat on one side of the room
and the wOmen on the other.
Only the Inner Quad buildings
were standing when Alice Newman
Hays came to Stanford on the open
ing day in 1891 where she has since
remained as Associate Librarian and
honorary Curator of Stanfordiana,
of which she is now emeritus.
Ilecalls Early Stanford
Besides the Inner Quad there
were Encina, the men's gym, Roble
Hall (now Sequoia), the women's
gym in what is now Woodpecker
Lodge, part of the Museum and a
few engineering buildings. Faculty
"cottages," as Mrs. Stanford called
them, were scattered around in the
fields which were being plowed.
It evidently rained as hard then as
now, and a cement walk led .from
Roble to Encina and a plank walk
from Roble to Quad. Roble. had a
special set. of reference books for
the use of the diligent freshman
women.
Original Collection
Students, then as now, handled

| the loaning out of the books, many
I of which the young and enthusiastic
faculty had loaned from their own
collections, brought when they came
with Dr. David Starr Jordan to help
start the new University.
Of that original collection the sec
ond book of which a record was
made was a book on fishes by Dr.
Jordan, and it is still in the posses
sion of the library.
Moved to Outer Quad
In 1900 the library was moved to
Outer Quad, then being constructed,
into what is now the Administration
building. The reading room was the
lobby where registration now takes
place. The reference room was in
the Dean of Women's present spot
and the periodical room whore Dean
Stalnaker's office is.
The day of moving to this new
location, which was called the
Thomas Welton Stanford Library,
was, Miss Hays said, almost a gen
eral University holiday. Everyone
helped carry books and file them.
Stanford Spirit
This was, she continued, in keep
ing with the spirit of co-operation
and simplicity which she believes
has been typical of Stanford, despite
its growth, since the days when Dr.
Jordan's great figure walked the
campus.
He and his friends brought the
Stanford spirit and vision to the new
! Western University founded out of
| the sorrow and love of Leland and
| Jane Lathrop Stanford. Miss Hays
said.
! Destroyed in Earthquake
The financial discouragements fol
lowing Senator Stanford's death did
not prevent the growth of the Uni
versity and its libraries. Mrs. Stan
lord lived to see the library building
she d ?sired almost completed, but it
was destroyed in the earthquake of
I 13QG and they remained very con
! tentedly in the Thomas Welton
I Stanford location until 1919, Miss
Hays commented.
When the present Stanford Li
j brary building was opened in 1919
| it was one of the most up-to-date
| and convenient in the country from
| the librarian's point of view, but was
I built without knowledge of sound
j proofing, she said, and ventilation
I was a problem as it is in all large
buildings.
