Editor of the Stanford Daily:
1» our opinion, the meeting of
the freshman class on November
13, in order to introduce the can
didates for class officers, was a
farce!
In the meeting, the ASSU presi
dent made the statement that there
would be no speeches made by the
candidates, since it was against Stan
ford tradition. We learned that
speeches are only allowed during
the elections in the spring quarter.
The candidates were then intro
duced. Each stood up when his name
was called, smiled, and sat down
without saying a word. It took no
longer than three minutes to present
the thirteen nominees to the entire
assembly.
We can readily see that, in the
case of sophomores and upper divi
sion students, speeches are not abso
lutely necessary during elections
held in the summer, autumn, or win
ter quarters, since the candidates
are generally well-known.
However, as far as the freshmen

are concerned, we feel that a se
rious mistake has been made. The
members of the freshmen class
come from various sections of the
country. In the short time we have j
been here, we have made many
friends, but there are still many
fine students whom we do not
know.
By denying the candidates, espe
cially the ones for president, the
right to speak because it is against
Stanford tradition, many members
of the freshmen class are in doubt
about whom to vote for.
We cannot contemplate a man's
leadership ability by watching him
stand up, smile, and sit down. We
can, however, judge the individual's
ability to command the respect of
the audience and learn what his
policy will be, if he is allowed to
talk. We fee! that both of these
things are absolutely necessary to
know in order to vote intelligently."
By the time this is published the j
president of the freshmen class
will have been elected. Whether
he is a leader, who is capable of
expressing his views clearly, time
will tell; we hope he is.
Stanford has many fine traditions j
which should be adhered to. How- |
ever, for the benefit of future fresh- !
men classes, let us eliminate this |
retrogressive tradition.

1» our opinion, the meeting of
the freshman class on November
13, in order to introduce the can
didates for class officers, was a
farce!
In the meeting, the ASSU presi
dent made the statement that there
would be no speeches made by the
candidates, since it was against Stan
ford tradition. We learned that
speeches are only allowed during
the elections in the spring quarter.
The candidates were then intro
duced. Each stood up when his name
was called, smiled, and sat down
without saying a word. It took no
longer than three minutes to present
the thirteen nominees to the entire
assembly.
We can readily see that, in the
case of sophomores and upper divi
sion students, speeches are not abso
lutely necessary during elections
held in the summer, autumn, or win
ter quarters, since the candidates
are generally well-known.
However, as far as the freshmen

are concerned, we feel that a se
rious mistake has been made. The
members of the freshmen class
come from various sections of the
country. In the short time we have j
been here, we have made many
friends, but there are still many
fine students whom we do not
know.
By denying the candidates, espe
cially the ones for president, the
right to speak because it is against
Stanford tradition, many members
of the freshmen class are in doubt
about whom to vote for.
We cannot contemplate a man's
leadership ability by watching him
stand up, smile, and sit down. We
can, however, judge the individual's
ability to command the respect of
the audience and learn what his
policy will be, if he is allowed to
talk. We fee! that both of these
things are absolutely necessary to
know in order to vote intelligently."
By the time this is published the j
president of the freshmen class
will have been elected. Whether
he is a leader, who is capable of
expressing his views clearly, time
will tell; we hope he is.
Stanford has many fine traditions j
which should be adhered to. How- |
ever, for the benefit of future fresh- !
men classes, let us eliminate this |
retrogressive tradition.
Respectfully submitted,
