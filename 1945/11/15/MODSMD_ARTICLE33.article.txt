# US To Lend 3½ Billions To England
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UP).—
Successful conclusion of Anglo-
American negotiations for a U.S.
loan to Britain is expected some
time next week, it was learned au
thoritatively tonight.
These sources said the area of
disagreement has narrowed down
to the size of the loan this country is
willing to make and two other mat
ters.
The Americans, it was understood,
feel that $3,500,000,000 would be
enough to put Britain's war-weak
ened economy back on its feet. The
British negotiators feel that $4,000,-
000,000 is needed.
It was said that the only other is
sues still to be settled are:
1. The provision which would en
able Britain to defer payment in
years when she could demonstrate
her inability to pay.
2. The conversion into other cur
encies of pound sterling balances
held in England.
The American view on the size
of the loan reportedly stems from
the belief that removal of trade re
strictions now imposed within the
British Empire will bring about a
large and rapid flow of trade, and
that the restoration of British eco
nomic health will therefore not re
quire the sum the British are asking.
The British take a more pessimis
tic view and are requesting the ad
ditional half billion.
Features of the loan which appear
to have been finally settled include
the rate of interest, expected to be
two per cent, and the duration, ex
pected to be at least 55 years. This
would include an initial five-year
period of grace during which no
payments would be made.
When payments begin, Britain
would pay annually one-fiftieth of
the amount she borrows, and also
pay two per cent interest on the
amount borrowed, but not repaid.
