# First Basketball Games Scheduled For Monday
## 
### STU MILLAR 
The Farm's first basketball game
has been scheduled for next Wed
nesday night and Coach Dean has
been preparing his squad for the
contest with hard workouts during
the last few days.
Last Tuesday night a long scrim
mage against the Palo Alto Elks and
an All-Star ERC Army unit has
given the coach a definite idea of
the strong and weak points of his
team.
Scrimmage Helps Team
"The workout was very helpful
to all of the boys," said the hoop
mentor in a Daily interview yes
terday. "Our most obvious early
season faults were a loose defense,
poor shooting and lack of co-ordi
nation on offense."
Dean is planning future workouts
to meet the need of the team and is
yet hopeful of coming up with
something resembling a pre-war
version of an Indian basketball
squad.
King, O'Brien Fight II Out
Max King and Bill O'Brien are
staging a hard battle for the cen
ter position. O'Brien, who has an
advantage in his 6-ft. 7-in. frame,
has excelled in the ball-handling
department. King, who is no slouch
in the foot and inch column himself,
has a good eye and some nice shots.
Ed Lefcourt, first-quarter freshman,
is also moving steadily into the
pivot picture with his aggressive
play.
Torn Hooa was moved up to one
of the first-string forward spots for
the lengthy practice session and Hill,
a Navy man, has been Dean's con
sistent choice for the other advance

position. His passing and defensive
game were outstanding, particularly
in the second half when he guarded
the Elks' star, Moyers, nicely.
Christianson Strong on Offense
Bill Christianson did a good job
on offense and should be a valuable
asset to the Cards as the season pro
gresses, according to Dean.
Dave Brown played the strongest
floor game of any Stanford man
and also led the local team in the
race for scoring honors.
No Positions Cinched Yet
So as it stands now, from these
six men, Christianson, Brown, O'-
Brien, King, Hill and Hood, should
come Stanford's starting team next
Monday. But the one forward po
sition has been changing very day.
All positions are still open if any
other player flashes some special
form this week.
For the other players, Coach Dean
had some praise. "Chillson is one
of the better ball-handlers and
shots. He and one or two others
could push the present first string."
Wallis and Rosehill might well
spend much time in actual floor ac
tion. Rosehill is showing a definite
eye for the bucket and is a danger
out offensive threat.
ft might be noted that the Elks
were not amateurs as far as bas
ketball experience and ability goes
Most of the men have played in
college at one time or another. Two,
Moyers and Brown, could stack up
well in almost any competition on
the coast this year.
Only extra-travel trip—there'll be
no barnstorming tour to the East
this season—the squad will prob
ably take this year will be to Reno,
Nevada, where a four-team tourna
ment to dedicate the new Nevada U.
field house will be held. The four
teams that will play on Dec. 28 and
29 are Nevada, Stanford, Utah, and
California.
