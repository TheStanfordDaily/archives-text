WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UP).—
Price Administrator Chester Bowles,
belabored by automobile dealeis for
more than a week, came under heavy
congressional fire today a§ Rep.
Henry D. Larcade (D., La.) intro
duced a bill to give OPA's pricing
authority to antoher agency.
Bowles and OPA were strongly
defended, however, by Representa
tives Adolph Sabath (D., 111.) and
William Gallagher (D., Minn.)
"If OPA price ceilings were re
moved, the price of sugar alone
would go to $2 a pound," Gallagher
told the House.
Sabath charges that "every indus
try is trying to get higher and high
er prices," and added:
"I don't know if anyone could do
as well as Bowles has done. I don't
always agree with him, but he is
trying to do an honest job. I believe
we should cease atatcking an honest
man who is trying to do an honest
job."
