# O.S.C. Vs. W.S.C.
## 
### 
CORVALLIS, Ore., Nov. 14 (UP).
â€” Substitute linemen received a
great deal of attention today from
line coaches Jim Dixon and Quent
Greenough in a heavy scrimmage
session as Oregon State's football
team speeded preparations for the
return game with Washington
State's potent Cougars here Satur
day.
The Beaver coaches are trying to
build up the reserve strength of the
Orange line for the W.S.C. contest.
Phil Sorboe's big tough line is
expected to present a real challenge
to a much improved Beaver forward
wall that outplayed the vaunted
Washington line last Saturday at
Seattle.
