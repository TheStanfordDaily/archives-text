tonight en route to • Portland for a
game with Oregon State gridsters
Saturday. Ord Giske and Tiny
Arndt, respectively starting tackle
and guard, were left at home be
cause of injuries.

take a later train, but Ai-ndt would
definitely be missing from the con
test.
Sorboe sent his athletes through

a stiff scrimmage before boarding
the train, the last before a light
workout on the Oregon State field
Saturday.
