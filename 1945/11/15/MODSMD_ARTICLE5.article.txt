Klahoya Club, for Stanford's off
campus women, will carry on one of
Stanford's most cherished traditions
when they have seven faculty mem
bers as guests for lunch Tuesday
noon at the Women's Clubhouse.
Aubrey Jones, club president, said
that this will be an opportunity for
the women to meet their favorite
professors under conditions which
arc more condusivc to acquaintance
than the class room. The names of
the guests will be announced later.
Lunch will be served and a pro
