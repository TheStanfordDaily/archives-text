# Schwartz Won Last Victory for Stanford
## 
### 
With Stanford's return to inter- i
collegiate athletics this Saturday, the |
Farm will have a football team for
t the first time in three years.
The last time the Indians played
in 1942 the season ended on an op- j
timistic note. The 1942 Big Game—
the last one—was a personal victory
for Marchie Schwartz, Stanford's
boy coach, as the San Francisco
newspapers tabbed him.
The Indians won that day, 26-7,
and the Daily sports editor said that
those 31 who helped regain the Axe
"are Stanford heroes who'll not be (
forgotten."
At the same time a Daily editorial
complimented the way the Stanford
| rooters supported the team at the
! game. "They seemed to have felt as
I much as the team did and did not
| lose interest in the game after our
| victory seemed certain."
In another editorial after the game
the Daily said "it will be good to see
the Axe back in the Cellar glass
case where it belongs." Now with
Stanford's return to sports, we will |
have to risk losing the Axe in our
Big Game with California next No
vember. Saturday's game will go a
long way towards determining what
kind of a team we'll have in 1940 to
throw against the Bears.
The last game of the 1942 season —
the last game the Indians played —
' was against St. Mary's Pre-flight.
I Pre-flight was loaded with ex
j Stanford stars (Bobby Grayson,
! Frankie Albert, and Co.)
Coach Schwartz's father ha d
passed away the week before the
game and Marchie had boarded a
: St. Louis train to attend the funeral.
| The squad then set out to "win this
I one for Marchie." And they did win
; that one for Marchie, 28-13. The 1942
squad was never better as they top
| pled Pre-flight from the undefeated
j ranks.
With the season ending on an opti
mistic note, plans for the 1943 sea
son were started. But Stanford didn't
play in '43 or '44—but Saturday the
j 1945 squad will trot out onto the

floor of the Stadium for the first of
their two games.
Enthusiasm has reached a high
stage for the Stockton game and the
Farm students are pointing to the
last of the '42 season for their an
swer. The last time Stanford played
they were good—and Saturday the
squad wants to prove that they're
true representatives of the Stanford
Red.

boy coach, as the San Francisco
newspapers tabbed him.
The Indians won that day, 26-7,
and the Daily sports editor said that
those 31 who helped regain the Axe
"are Stanford heroes who'll not be (
forgotten."
At the same time a Daily editorial
complimented the way the Stanford
| rooters supported the team at the
! game. "They seemed to have felt as
I much as the team did and did not
| lose interest in the game after our
| victory seemed certain."
In another editorial after the game
the Daily said "it will be good to see
the Axe back in the Cellar glass
case where it belongs." Now with
Stanford's return to sports, we will |
have to risk losing the Axe in our
Big Game with California next No
vember. Saturday's game will go a
long way towards determining what
kind of a team we'll have in 1940 to
throw against the Bears.
The last game of the 1942 season —
the last game the Indians played —
' was against St. Mary's Pre-flight.
I Pre-flight was loaded with ex
j Stanford stars (Bobby Grayson,
! Frankie Albert, and Co.)
Coach Schwartz's father ha d
passed away the week before the
game and Marchie had boarded a
: St. Louis train to attend the funeral.
| The squad then set out to "win this
I one for Marchie." And they did win
; that one for Marchie, 28-13. The 1942
squad was never better as they top
| pled Pre-flight from the undefeated
j ranks.
With the season ending on an opti
mistic note, plans for the 1943 sea
son were started. But Stanford didn't
play in '43 or '44—but Saturday the
j 1945 squad will trot out onto the

floor of the Stadium for the first of
their two games.
Enthusiasm has reached a high
stage for the Stockton game and the
Farm students are pointing to the
last of the '42 season for their an
swer. The last time Stanford played
they were good—and Saturday the
squad wants to prove that they're
true representatives of the Stanford
Red.
With Stanford's return to inter- i
collegiate athletics this Saturday, the |
Farm will have a football team for
t the first time in three years.
The last time the Indians played
in 1942 the season ended on an op- j

the last one—was a personal victory

newspapers tabbed him.
