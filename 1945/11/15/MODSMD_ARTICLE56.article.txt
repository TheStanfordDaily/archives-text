# 'Joey' Calls Army Games
## 
### JOEY C. HEIDELBERG 
Two hours before game time the
sports editor asked what was doing
tonight (Wednesday) in army bas
ketball circles. Since the games will
actually be played by the time that
the reading public: sees this, yours
truly arrived at a decision to predict
what will happen tonight and let the
readers see for themselves at the
same time just how badly off form
the prognostications are. After all,
the Daily Sports staff has been at
tempting all fall to call the nation's
football games and have done so-so,
and so why should one not try it in
this basketball tournament?
Except in one or (wo cases all de
cisions are based on which side of
the coin turned up, but here goes:
Coots over Lil' Papooses — Only
because of the Coots' advantage in
age and experience.
Lilywhiters over Bullets — A nip
and tuck battle which will likely as
not go the other way, but since a tie
is impossible, I have to take one of
the two.
Corsairs over Buzz-Bombs — The
Bombs provided the big noise last
week with their upset over the
Shushies, but upsets don't usually
come twice in a row from the same
team.
Vita-Men over B.F.'s—This one is
the most certain, and only one of
those impossible appearing upsets
could make it end differently.
On Thursday night the winners of
the first and second of the above
games will square off with each
other as will the victors in the sec
ond and third tilts. Then next week,
probably Tuesday night, the finals
will be played in the Pavilion. The
ultimate winner will be AST cham
pion and each member of the team
will i'eceive a oen.
