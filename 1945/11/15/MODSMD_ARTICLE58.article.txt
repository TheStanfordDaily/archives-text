It is often said these days that
the science of human relationships
is lagging far behind the natural
sciences. "If only we could analyze
ourselves," people exclaim, "with
the same objectivity and intcllec
tuar honesty that we apply to, say,
failing bodies, we could make this
earth a very much better place to
live in."
This is Reves' fundamental belief.
However, he seems to think that we
are already, to a large extent, using
scientific means, for he tells us that
our method of looking at the world
may be compared to ancient astron
omy which took the earth as center
of the universe. This view was ac
ceptable only as long as it could ex
plain all the facts.
Obsolete Means
When better means of observation
were devised, new problems arose,
and the Greek theory was discarded
in favor of the Copernican. Similarly
we are beginning to realize that our
political and social theories cannot

copc with the complcx problems of
today.
Thus to Reves the problem is not
one of instituting scientific thinking,
but to switch from one theory,to an
other in order to obtain a better ex
planation of the facts. The funda
mental weakness of the work arises
from this untrue analogy between
the development of political science
and of astronomy. Actually the sci
ence of "human relationship" is not
at the stage of Greek astronomy to
day, but about a thousand years be
hind it. This misunderstanding leads
to a deplorable weakness in method
on Reves' part.
Nevertheless the need of a new
theory is clear:
Unsolved Problems
"We realize that although we can
have all the machinery we need, we
cannot solve the problems of pro
duction. We realize that in spite of
the far-flung and tremendous scope
of transportation, we cannot prevent
famine and starvation in many
places, while there is abundance
elsewhere on the earth. We realize
that although hundreds of millions
are desperately in need of food and
industrial products, we cannot pre
vent mass unemployment. We real
ize that even though we have mined
more gold than ever before, we can
not stabilize currency. We realize
that while every modern country
needs raw materials that other coun
tries have, and produces goods which
other countries need, we have been
unable to organize a satisfactory
method of exchange. We realize that
although the overwhelming major
ity of all people hate violence and
long to live in peace, we cannot pre
vent recurrent and increasingly dev
astating world wars. We realize that
armaments must lead to wars be
tween nations, but we have learned
the bitter truth that disarmament
also leads io war.
"In this confusion and chaos in
which civilized nations arc strug
gling with utter helplessness, we
are hnund to arrive at the inevit

able conclusion that the cause of
this hopelessness and helplessness
lies not in the outer world hut in
ourselves. Not in the problems we
have to solve but in the hypothe
ses with which we approach their
solutions."
By analyzing history in a fairly
objective if unthorough manner,
Reves reaches three important con
clusions:
Road to Fascism
I. Both present-day capitalistic
and socialistic countries arc becom
ing totalitarian. Some of them arc
already. Nationalism causes govern
ments to assume more and more
power, for it is imperative to the
survival of the nation-state to be
come increasingly dictatorial.
11. The causes for war arc not
to be found in the multitude of
different explanations offered, but,
simply in the fact that units of
equal sovereignty always fight
each other. All other explanations,
such as "war is inherent in human
nature," arc irrelevant, for the sig
nificant observation to make is
that as long as there were inde
pendent estates they fought each
other—in the days of feudalism—
until estates were formed into
counties. Later the independent
counties fought each other until
formed into states. These states
fought each other as long as they
were independent and until they
were grouped as nations. Now the
nations fight each other.
World Government
The conclusion is obvious: Since
wars are always fought between
units of equal sovereignty—from the
feudal barons and independent towns
to the giant empires of today—the
only way to avoid them is to unite
all countries under a higher sover
eignty.
111. The most important concept in
the attainment of freedom and peace
is law. Without it there can be nei
ther. Freedom cannot be achieved
by having the state "wither away,"
as Communist theorists hope, nor by
letting the state become dominant.
The method of approaching man's
ideal of freedom — "freedom from
being killed, robbed, chcatod, op
pressed, tortured, and exploited by
the stronger"—is law.
Law and Peace
Just as law and order maintains
peace within a country it must keep
order between countries. This can
only be accomplished through world
government. Diplomacy, policy, and
treaties are bound to fail. No matter
what kind of treaty we make now,
it cannot prevent another war. For
"peace is law. It Is order. It is gov
ernment."
Reves deserves much credit for
encouraging honest thinking about
war, for showing the futility of talk
ing. about compulsory military serv
ice, treaties, collective security, dis
armament and internationalism
existing theories cannot solve satis
nationalism'), and for restating ef
fectively in twentieth century terms
what Kant said 150 years ago in one
of those classics everyone respccts
and no one reads:
Kant
"That a people should say, 'There

shall not be war among us: we will
form ourselves into a state; that is
to say, we will ourselves establish a
legislative, executive, and judiciary
power, to decide our differences,' —
can be conceived.
But if this state should say.
'There shall be no war between us
and other states, although wc do
not acknowledge a supreme pow
er, that guarantees our reciprocal
rights'; upon what then can this
confidcncc in one's rights be
founded, except it is upou this free
federation, this supplement of the
social compact, which reason nec
essarily associates with the idea of
public right."
Criticism
If that were all Reeves attempted
to do, there would be no criticism.
Even as propaganda for world fed
oration his book is persuasive, force
ful, often logical, and full of the im
pressive truisms ("Credulity is not
faith," "Destructive criticism brings
neither revolution nor progress")
that, seems to be required of the
modern writer.
However, Reves aims at a much
higher goal. If his introduction is to
be taken seriously it is his purpose
to develop a scientific theory that
will fit the facts of today and pro
vide solutions to our problems. His
method, effective as it may be as
rhetoric, is anything but scientific.
He shows that law is necessary to
maintain freedom and peace. He
docs this in a manner so sketchy
that the scientist would be terrified.
Unscientific
At the beginning of his work he
states a number of problems which
existing thtorics cannot solve satis
factorily. Yet, most unscientifically,
he fails to show what his theories
would do with them. It is notewor
thy that while emphasizing in the
first chapter that vital economic
questions are not answered by ac

ccpted theories, Reves completely
ignores economic matters through
out the rest of his book.
He can therefore have no assur
ance whatsoever that his theory is
valid, for it is futile to attempt a
solution of political difficulties
without a simultaneous remedy
ing of economic ills.
Planless
Reves has a sense of Humor. After
developing his ideas on law and
world government he asks: "How
can these propositions be translated
into institutions and bccomc the
driving force of political reality?"
And he answers, simply and to the
point: "Nothing is more futile than
to work out. detailed plans."
To state over and over that the
world would be a better placc to live
in "if the conduct of human affairs
were based on principles and rea
son" is not sufficient.
Most of us know that.
The two most important ques
tions remain unanswered: What
arc those principles? How can wc
establish them as basis of human
conduct? George Brunn.
