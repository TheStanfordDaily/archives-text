# Palo Alio Times Acquires Site For Proposed Radio Station
## 
### DILL FILERS 
Authorization of a proposed fre
quency-modulated radio station to
serve the Stanford-Palo Alto area
was hoped for by the Palo Alto
Times yesterday as it acquired the
site for the new Times plant and
proposed studios at Ramona street
and Lytton avenue in Palo Alto.
The station application Is one of
665 FM stations sought in this coun
try. To date, 129 have been granted
at the rate of 65 a week. Of these,
about 40 per cent arc owned by
newspaper interests.
Technical Aspects
Hugh H. Skilling, Acting Dean of
the School of Engineering, said he
has discusscd the technical aspects
of such a station with the paper, j
Several graduate students have been
working with the Times, but as far
as he knew, no measurements of
power and possible antenna coverage
had been taken.
Stanford officials were quick to
endorse the opportunities such a sta- !
tion would offer.
University Coverage
President Donald B. Tresidder re
marked that "for a considerable time
the university has felt the need for
more adequate radio coverage of its |
own educational activities."
"The university has not only a [
considerable number of students of ;
radio technique, public speaking, 1
music, speech and drama, but also
in its laboratories and among its
professors are potential radio mate
rials which, if broadcast, would
measurably enrich the cultural and
political life of this and nearby com
munities," Dr. Tresidder said.
Stanford already offers three
courses in broadcasting in the
Speech and Drama curriculum. An
"Introduction to Radio" in fall quar
ter presents a survey of the entire
broadcasting field, including the op
eration of stations and networks plus
some actual practice.
Radio Courses
Winter and spring quarter courses
deal with the technical and produc
tion phases of broadcasting consecu
tively. All are three-unit courses,
and use the campus studio and con
trol room in the Memorial Audito
rium.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, acting
the radio courses, told of Stanford's
previous radio experience. "The
original 'Stanford Hour' on NBC and
early radio speech classes were fore
runners of the growing radio pro
gram," Mr. Adams recounted.
Provides Incentive
"For some time Stanford students
in the Radio Workshop presented
programs over KQW. At present the

Department of Speech and Drama
joins with NBC in sponsoring a sum
mer radio institute," he said.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, Acting
head of the Department of Speech
and Drama, felt the station "will
provide a definite incentive for the
development of the work in radio in
our department."
Practical Experience
"More than that," Mr. Anderson
continued, "it should provide oppor
tunities for practical experience for
students interested in other phases
of Speech and Drama such as acting,
directing, public speaking, and pub
lic reading." He pointed out that
Stanford has a ' well-equipped stu
dio and control room."
Dr. Hubert Heffner, head of the
Department of Speech and Drama
now in Europe, stated that radio
dramatizations of great plays and of
outstanding events in American His
tory might well be educational fea
tures of the commercial station.
Mayor Endorses Plan
Mayor J. Byron Blois of Palo Alto
has endorsed the plan with other city
officials. "The city of Palo Alto par
ticularly needs local broadcast faciU
ities now ... to better acquaint our
citizens with municipal problems.
We also have a recreational problem
which could be greatly helped by a
local broadcasting station," the may
or said.
The power and location of the Palo
Alto transmitter must be approved
by the Federal Communications
Commission. Only other radio station
applied for on the Peninsula is a 250
watt AM broadcast station in San
Mateo. It likewise has not yet been
authorized.
New System
The radio industry's trade maga
zine, Broadcasting, said the FCC is
"eager to get the new services start
ed as quickly as possible. It is espe
cially concerned that FM and tele
vision are not delayed, knowing full
well that receiver manufacturers are
eager to produce cheap AM sets for
a radio-hungry public which will

not be disposed to wait for combina
tion sets."
Frequency modulation necessitates
different receiver than is now use<l,
or a new attachment designed to
connect to the AM receiver. The new
system, engineers say, will eliminate
static and provide a three-dimen
sional Lone.
Most experts, however, believe it
will be some time before FM sta
tions will be in profitable operation.
Many regular broadcast stations
have now filed FM applications to
supplement their regular services.

not be disposed to wait for combina
tion sets."
Frequency modulation necessitates
different receiver than is now use<l,
or a new attachment designed to
connect to the AM receiver. The new
system, engineers say, will eliminate
static and provide a three-dimen
sional Lone.
Most experts, however, believe it
will be some time before FM sta
tions will be in profitable operation.
Many regular broadcast stations
have now filed FM applications to
supplement their regular services.
Authorization of a proposed fre
quency-modulated radio station to
serve the Stanford-Palo Alto area
was hoped for by the Palo Alto
Times yesterday as it acquired the
site for the new Times plant and
proposed studios at Ramona street
and Lytton avenue in Palo Alto.
The station application Is one of
665 FM stations sought in this coun
try. To date, 129 have been granted
at the rate of 65 a week. Of these,
about 40 per cent arc owned by
newspaper interests.
Technical Aspects
Hugh H. Skilling, Acting Dean of
the School of Engineering, said he
has discusscd the technical aspects
of such a station with the paper, j
Several graduate students have been
working with the Times, but as far
as he knew, no measurements of
power and possible antenna coverage
had been taken.
Stanford officials were quick to
endorse the opportunities such a sta- !
tion would offer.
University Coverage
President Donald B. Tresidder re
marked that "for a considerable time
the university has felt the need for
more adequate radio coverage of its |
own educational activities."
"The university has not only a [
considerable number of students of ;
radio technique, public speaking, 1
music, speech and drama, but also
in its laboratories and among its
professors are potential radio mate
rials which, if broadcast, would
measurably enrich the cultural and
political life of this and nearby com
munities," Dr. Tresidder said.
Stanford already offers three
courses in broadcasting in the
Speech and Drama curriculum. An
"Introduction to Radio" in fall quar
ter presents a survey of the entire
broadcasting field, including the op
eration of stations and networks plus
some actual practice.
Radio Courses
Winter and spring quarter courses
deal with the technical and produc
tion phases of broadcasting consecu
tively. All are three-unit courses,
and use the campus studio and con
trol room in the Memorial Audito
rium.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, acting
the radio courses, told of Stanford's
previous radio experience. "The
original 'Stanford Hour' on NBC and
early radio speech classes were fore
runners of the growing radio pro
gram," Mr. Adams recounted.
Provides Incentive
"For some time Stanford students
in the Radio Workshop presented
programs over KQW. At present the

Department of Speech and Drama
joins with NBC in sponsoring a sum
mer radio institute," he said.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, Acting
head of the Department of Speech
and Drama, felt the station "will
provide a definite incentive for the
development of the work in radio in
our department."
Practical Experience
"More than that," Mr. Anderson
continued, "it should provide oppor
tunities for practical experience for
students interested in other phases
of Speech and Drama such as acting,
directing, public speaking, and pub
lic reading." He pointed out that
Stanford has a ' well-equipped stu
dio and control room."
Dr. Hubert Heffner, head of the
Department of Speech and Drama
now in Europe, stated that radio
dramatizations of great plays and of
outstanding events in American His
tory might well be educational fea
tures of the commercial station.
Mayor Endorses Plan
Mayor J. Byron Blois of Palo Alto
has endorsed the plan with other city
officials. "The city of Palo Alto par
ticularly needs local broadcast faciU
ities now ... to better acquaint our
citizens with municipal problems.
We also have a recreational problem
which could be greatly helped by a
local broadcasting station," the may
or said.
The power and location of the Palo
Alto transmitter must be approved
by the Federal Communications
Commission. Only other radio station
applied for on the Peninsula is a 250
watt AM broadcast station in San
Mateo. It likewise has not yet been
authorized.
New System
The radio industry's trade maga
zine, Broadcasting, said the FCC is
"eager to get the new services start
ed as quickly as possible. It is espe
cially concerned that FM and tele
vision are not delayed, knowing full
well that receiver manufacturers are
eager to produce cheap AM sets for
a radio-hungry public which will

not be disposed to wait for combina

watt AM broadcast station in San
Mateo. It likewise has not yet been
authorized.
New System
The radio industry's trade maga
zine, Broadcasting, said the FCC is
"eager to get the new services start
ed as quickly as possible. It is espe
cially concerned that FM and tele
vision are not delayed, knowing full
well that receiver manufacturers are
eager to produce cheap AM sets for
a radio-hungry public which will

not be disposed to wait for combina
tion sets."
Frequency modulation necessitates
different receiver than is now use<l,
or a new attachment designed to
connect to the AM receiver. The new
system, engineers say, will eliminate
static and provide a three-dimen
sional Lone.
Most experts, however, believe it
will be some time before FM sta
tions will be in profitable operation.
Many regular broadcast stations
have now filed FM applications to
supplement their regular services.
Authorization of a proposed fre
quency-modulated radio station to
serve the Stanford-Palo Alto area
was hoped for by the Palo Alto
Times yesterday as it acquired the
site for the new Times plant and
proposed studios at Ramona street
and Lytton avenue in Palo Alto.
The station application Is one of
665 FM stations sought in this coun
try. To date, 129 have been granted
at the rate of 65 a week. Of these,
about 40 per cent arc owned by
newspaper interests.
Technical Aspects
Hugh H. Skilling, Acting Dean of
the School of Engineering, said he
has discusscd the technical aspects
of such a station with the paper, j
Several graduate students have been
working with the Times, but as far
as he knew, no measurements of
power and possible antenna coverage
had been taken.
Stanford officials were quick to
endorse the opportunities such a sta- !
tion would offer.
University Coverage
President Donald B. Tresidder re
marked that "for a considerable time
the university has felt the need for
more adequate radio coverage of its |
own educational activities."
"The university has not only a [
considerable number of students of ;
radio technique, public speaking, 1
music, speech and drama, but also
in its laboratories and among its
professors are potential radio mate
rials which, if broadcast, would
measurably enrich the cultural and
political life of this and nearby com
munities," Dr. Tresidder said.
Stanford already offers three
courses in broadcasting in the
Speech and Drama curriculum. An
"Introduction to Radio" in fall quar
ter presents a survey of the entire
broadcasting field, including the op
eration of stations and networks plus
some actual practice.
Radio Courses
Winter and spring quarter courses
deal with the technical and produc
tion phases of broadcasting consecu
tively. All are three-unit courses,
and use the campus studio and con
trol room in the Memorial Audito
rium.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, acting
the radio courses, told of Stanford's
previous radio experience. "The
original 'Stanford Hour' on NBC and
early radio speech classes were fore
runners of the growing radio pro
gram," Mr. Adams recounted.
Provides Incentive
"For some time Stanford students
in the Radio Workshop presented
programs over KQW. At present the

Department of Speech and Drama
joins with NBC in sponsoring a sum
mer radio institute," he said.
Dr. Virgil A. Anderson, Acting
head of the Department of Speech
and Drama, felt the station "will
provide a definite incentive for the
development of the work in radio in
our department."
Practical Experience
"More than that," Mr. Anderson
continued, "it should provide oppor
tunities for practical experience for
students interested in other phases
of Speech and Drama such as acting,
directing, public speaking, and pub
lic reading." He pointed out that
Stanford has a ' well-equipped stu
dio and control room."
Dr. Hubert Heffner, head of the
Department of Speech and Drama
now in Europe, stated that radio
dramatizations of great plays and of
outstanding events in American His
tory might well be educational fea
tures of the commercial station.
Mayor Endorses Plan
Mayor J. Byron Blois of Palo Alto
has endorsed the plan with other city
officials. "The city of Palo Alto par
ticularly needs local broadcast faciU
ities now ... to better acquaint our
citizens with municipal problems.
We also have a recreational problem
which could be greatly helped by a
local broadcasting station," the may
or said.
The power and location of the Palo
Alto transmitter must be approved
by the Federal Communications
Commission. Only other radio station
applied for on the Peninsula is a 250
watt AM broadcast station in San
Mateo. It likewise has not yet been
authorized.
