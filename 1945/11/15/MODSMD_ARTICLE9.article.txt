Bill Edlund as Tom, Stu Harrison
as Dick, and Douglas Noble as Harry
sec "A Girl in Every Port" and a
girl in every costume as they listen
and participate in songs, music and
action typical of the various coun
tries through which they travel.
Mmmm—Beauties
Tom is dazzled by the native
beauties, Dick is a "wolf on the
prowl," but Harry is a reassurance
to co-eds as he remains adamantly
faithful to the "girl back home,"
even though the "girl back home"
receives quite a little competition
from the feminine singers and
dancers.
One song which should prove to
deserve particular notice by the au
dience is "You're Everything a
Sailor Dreams Of," submitted by
Shirley Hendrickson. Don Scott will
sing it.and its catchy tune should
leave many huntming as they leave
the theater.
