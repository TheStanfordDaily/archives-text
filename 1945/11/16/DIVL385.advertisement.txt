"More farm life
for me!"
New developments, offering advantages of speed and
economy in construction, are being fully used in our |*' «»-
gram forextending and impro\ ing lurm telephone serv ire.
Among these are mechanical pole-hole diggers and
plows for burying wire underground. Sturdier steel wire
that permits longer spans will require fewer poles.

to provide telephone service over rural electric lines.
Radio, too. is being studied for use in connecting more
