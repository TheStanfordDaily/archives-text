# New Dorms Planned; B.A.C. To Reorganize
## 
### 
A plan for reorganization of (lie athletics and |»!».ys
ical education program at Stanford, including appoint
ment of Alfred 11. Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control, to the new position as
Director of Athletics and Physical Training, was, ap-

proved at a meeting here this af
ternoon of the University's Board of
Trustees.
The functions carried on by the
School of Health, whose general di
rector has been responsible for
physical training and athletics, will
be administered by other units of
the University under this reorgani
zation, and a unified health service
for both men and women will be
established with a director in
charge.
Another major change involves
transfer to the School of Educa
tion of the responsibility for pro
fessional training of teachers of
physical education, including the
courses in the curriculum, instruc
tion. and administration.
"In the field of physical train
ing and athletics, the primary
purpose of the reorganization,"
President Donald B. Trcsiddcr ex
plained, "is to provide for more
effective administration of all
sports, including both intercolle
giate and intramural, by placing
an executive director in charge.
"We are determined that Stanford
shall again be a strong competitor
to be reckoned with by other mem
bers of the Pacific Coast Conference.
But we are equally determined that
participation in sports will not be
confined primarily to those who take
part in intercollegiate games.
"Physical examinations during
the war indicated a shocking defi
ciency in the physical develop
ment of youth in America. In so
far as possible, we are going to
correct this situation at Stanford
by encouraging wider participa
tion in intramural and other
sports," Dr. Trcsiddcr said.
Under the plan the Faculty Ath
lctic Committee will continue as at
present to advise the President on
general athletic and physical train
ing policies, including academic
credits for participation in physical
training and athletics, physical
training requirements, and control
of intercollegiate competition and
eligibility.
The B.A.C. will continue to be
composed of three faculty mem
bers appointed each year by the
President of the University, three
alumni members chosen by the
Alumni Executive Board, and
three student members chosen an
nually by the student body. The
B.A.C. will be concerned with
athletic schedules, physical fa
cilities for athletics, and recom
mendations for appointment to
the staff of coaches, instructors
and trainers in physical training
and athletics.
The Director of Athletics and
Physical Training will be appointed
annually by the President of the
University, with the approval of the
Board of Trustees. As the title im
plies, he will be the executive offi
cer responsible for administration of
the program.
Al Masters has been general
manager of the B.A.C. for the past
20 years, and has also served as
administrative assistant to the
Financial Vice - President. Now,
however, he will devote full time
to athletics and physical training.

Proposals for early construction of new campus
housing facilities, including apartment units for mar
ried veterans and graduate students, were approved hy
the Stanford University Board of Trustees at a mcct-
I ing this afternoon in San Francisco,

Details of plans—including type,
numbers, cost, location, etc. —have
not as yet been worked out. This
will be done at once, however.
These proposals grew out of a
survey of campus housing needs
which has been made by Eldridge
T. Spencer, director of planning for
the University.
This decision has been reached,
President Donald B. Trcsiddcr
said, because of the fact that with
housing virtually unobtainable in
the Palo Alto area, many married
veterans who would like to at
tend the University under the G.I.
Bill of Rights and the Vocational
Rehabilitation legislation have
been unable to do so.
Proposals for construction of per
manent housing resulted after ef
forts to meet the problem with trail
ers or other temporary facilities
proved fruitless. Aside from the
immediate problem of housing vet
erans, however, University leaders
believe there will be a continuing
demand for such campus housing
for married graduate students, re
search workers, fellows, and staff
members. Consequently, this hous
ing will also be available to persons
in these categories.
The time of completion of the
new facilities will depend upon
such factors as availability of la
bor and materials, but it is
thought that some units will be
ready for occupancy by next fall.
The proposals approved by the
Board of Trustees also included re
modeling of multiple-story dormi
tories for lower division students
and construction of new one-story
structures for upper division stu
dents, including unmarried return
ing veterans.

tend the University under the G.I.
Bill of Rights and the Vocational
Rehabilitation legislation have
been unable to do so.
Proposals for construction of per
manent housing resulted after ef
forts to meet the problem with trail
ers or other temporary facilities
proved fruitless. Aside from the
immediate problem of housing vet
erans, however, University leaders
believe there will be a continuing
demand for such campus housing
for married graduate students, re
search workers, fellows, and staff
members. Consequently, this hous
ing will also be available to persons
in these categories.
The time of completion of the
new facilities will depend upon
such factors as availability of la
bor and materials, but it is
thought that some units will be
ready for occupancy by next fall.

A plan for reorganization of (lie athletics and |»!».ys
ical education program at Stanford, including appoint
ment of Alfred 11. Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control, to the new position as
Director of Athletics and Physical Training, was, ap-

proved at a meeting here this af
ternoon of the University's Board of
Trustees.
The functions carried on by the
School of Health, whose general di
rector has been responsible for
physical training and athletics, will
be administered by other units of
the University under this reorgani
zation, and a unified health service
for both men and women will be
established with a director in
charge.
Another major change involves
transfer to the School of Educa
tion of the responsibility for pro
fessional training of teachers of
physical education, including the
courses in the curriculum, instruc
tion. and administration.
"In the field of physical train
ing and athletics, the primary
purpose of the reorganization,"
President Donald B. Trcsiddcr ex
plained, "is to provide for more
effective administration of all
sports, including both intercolle
giate and intramural, by placing
an executive director in charge.
"We are determined that Stanford
shall again be a strong competitor
to be reckoned with by other mem
bers of the Pacific Coast Conference.
But we are equally determined that
participation in sports will not be
confined primarily to those who take
part in intercollegiate games.
"Physical examinations during
the war indicated a shocking defi
ciency in the physical develop
ment of youth in America. In so
far as possible, we are going to
correct this situation at Stanford
by encouraging wider participa
tion in intramural and other
sports," Dr. Trcsiddcr said.
Under the plan the Faculty Ath
lctic Committee will continue as at
present to advise the President on
general athletic and physical train
ing policies, including academic
credits for participation in physical
training and athletics, physical
training requirements, and control
of intercollegiate competition and
eligibility.
The B.A.C. will continue to be
composed of three faculty mem
bers appointed each year by the
President of the University, three
alumni members chosen by the
Alumni Executive Board, and
three student members chosen an
nually by the student body. The
B.A.C. will be concerned with
athletic schedules, physical fa
cilities for athletics, and recom
mendations for appointment to
the staff of coaches, instructors
and trainers in physical training
and athletics.
The Director of Athletics and
Physical Training will be appointed
annually by the President of the
University, with the approval of the
Board of Trustees. As the title im
plies, he will be the executive offi
cer responsible for administration of
the program.
Al Masters has been general
manager of the B.A.C. for the past
20 years, and has also served as
administrative assistant to the
Financial Vice - President. Now,
however, he will devote full time
to athletics and physical training.

Proposals for early construction of new campus
housing facilities, including apartment units for mar
ried veterans and graduate students, were approved hy
the Stanford University Board of Trustees at a mcct-
I ing this afternoon in San Francisco,

Details of plans—including type,
numbers, cost, location, etc. —have
not as yet been worked out. This
will be done at once, however.
These proposals grew out of a
survey of campus housing needs
which has been made by Eldridge
T. Spencer, director of planning for
the University.
This decision has been reached,
President Donald B. Trcsiddcr
said, because of the fact that with
housing virtually unobtainable in
the Palo Alto area, many married
veterans who would like to at
tend the University under the G.I.

however, he will devote full time
to athletics and physical training.

Proposals for early construction of new campus
housing facilities, including apartment units for mar
ried veterans and graduate students, were approved hy
the Stanford University Board of Trustees at a mcct-
I ing this afternoon in San Francisco,

Details of plans—including type,
numbers, cost, location, etc. —have
not as yet been worked out. This
will be done at once, however.
These proposals grew out of a
survey of campus housing needs
which has been made by Eldridge
T. Spencer, director of planning for
the University.
This decision has been reached,
President Donald B. Trcsiddcr
said, because of the fact that with
housing virtually unobtainable in
the Palo Alto area, many married
veterans who would like to at
tend the University under the G.I.
Bill of Rights and the Vocational
Rehabilitation legislation have
been unable to do so.
Proposals for construction of per
manent housing resulted after ef
forts to meet the problem with trail
ers or other temporary facilities
proved fruitless. Aside from the
immediate problem of housing vet
erans, however, University leaders
believe there will be a continuing
demand for such campus housing
for married graduate students, re
search workers, fellows, and staff
members. Consequently, this hous
ing will also be available to persons
in these categories.
The time of completion of the
new facilities will depend upon
such factors as availability of la
bor and materials, but it is
thought that some units will be
ready for occupancy by next fall.
The proposals approved by the
Board of Trustees also included re
modeling of multiple-story dormi
tories for lower division students
and construction of new one-story
structures for upper division stu
dents, including unmarried return
ing veterans.
A plan for reorganization of (lie athletics and |»!».ys
ical education program at Stanford, including appoint
ment of Alfred 11. Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control, to the new position as
Director of Athletics and Physical Training, was, ap-

proved at a meeting here this af
ternoon of the University's Board of
Trustees.
The functions carried on by the
School of Health, whose general di
rector has been responsible for
physical training and athletics, will
be administered by other units of
the University under this reorgani
zation, and a unified health service
for both men and women will be
established with a director in
charge.
Another major change involves
transfer to the School of Educa
tion of the responsibility for pro
fessional training of teachers of
physical education, including the
courses in the curriculum, instruc
tion. and administration.
"In the field of physical train
ing and athletics, the primary
purpose of the reorganization,"
President Donald B. Trcsiddcr ex
plained, "is to provide for more
effective administration of all
sports, including both intercolle
giate and intramural, by placing
an executive director in charge.
"We are determined that Stanford
shall again be a strong competitor
to be reckoned with by other mem
bers of the Pacific Coast Conference.
But we are equally determined that
participation in sports will not be
confined primarily to those who take
part in intercollegiate games.
"Physical examinations during
the war indicated a shocking defi
ciency in the physical develop
ment of youth in America. In so
far as possible, we are going to
correct this situation at Stanford
by encouraging wider participa
tion in intramural and other
sports," Dr. Trcsiddcr said.
Under the plan the Faculty Ath
lctic Committee will continue as at
present to advise the President on
general athletic and physical train
ing policies, including academic
credits for participation in physical
training and athletics, physical
training requirements, and control
of intercollegiate competition and
eligibility.
The B.A.C. will continue to be
composed of three faculty mem
bers appointed each year by the
President of the University, three
alumni members chosen by the
Alumni Executive Board, and
three student members chosen an
nually by the student body. The
B.A.C. will be concerned with
athletic schedules, physical fa
cilities for athletics, and recom
mendations for appointment to
the staff of coaches, instructors
and trainers in physical training
and athletics.
The Director of Athletics and
Physical Training will be appointed
annually by the President of the
University, with the approval of the
Board of Trustees. As the title im
plies, he will be the executive offi
cer responsible for administration of
the program.
