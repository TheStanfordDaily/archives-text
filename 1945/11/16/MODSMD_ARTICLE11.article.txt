One hundred five members of the
Stanford faculty have signed a pe
tition circulated on campus by
I Physics Professor Paul Kirkpatrick
and drawn up by the Federation of
J Atomic Scientists which urged in
ternational control and co-operation
in the administration of what they

weapon," the atom bomb.
This petition will be sent to Con
gress and President Truman, signed
i by scientists and scholars through
out. the United States, in hopes that
their recommendations will be con
sidered immediately.
The petition reads as follows:
"We recognize that: (1) there has
j been unleashed in the atomic bomb
the most destructive force known to
! mankind, against which there can
J be no military defense and in the
[ production of which the United
j States can have no enduring mo-
I nopoly; (2) any efTort to formulate

our foreign policy on (he basis of a
temporary superiority in atomic
weapons will force other nations as
well as ourselves into an atomic ar
maments race, thereby creating a
world of fear and hatred in which
both great and small nations will
face sudden destruction; (3) domes
tic policy must free scientific in
vestigation and discussion, and pub
lic surveillance and criticism of the
application of atomic energy is the
best guarantee that peace will be
secured, that competition in devas
tating armaments will be ended, and
that the public will be given full
use of scientific developments which,
furthered under government spon
sorship, belong to the people that
this government represents.
'"We, therefore, urge that:
"(1) A system of international
control and co-operation be estab
lished in order to safeguard world
peace. We urge that the President
of the United States immediately
invite the governments of Great
Britain and the Soviet Union to a
conference to prevent a competitive
armaments race, to plan interna
tional control of mankind's most
devastating weapons, and jointly
initiate machinery to make avail
able to all people the peacetime
benefits of atomic energy.
"(2) A domestic policy on the
control and development of atomic
energy, in harmony with an inter
national system of control and co
operation, be established by the
President and the Congress of the
United States, providing for scien
tific freedom and the peacetime util
