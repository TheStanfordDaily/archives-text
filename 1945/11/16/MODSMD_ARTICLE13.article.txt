# Model T To Roll Again; Gaieties Opens Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight for the first time since fall '41 a peare-time
Gaieties will be presented on the Stanford campus.
The title "Big Game" has not yet been restored to the
traditional Ram's Head football production, but the
directors promise that the Navy theme will supply the

same spirit. ♦
This is also the first time that |
Gaieties has attempted to build the !
entire show around one theme, car- |
rying it through all acts, songs, and
orchestral numbers. Lois Williams,
associate director, and Janice Swan,
assistant director, worked with
Mary Lou Patton, director, and the I
rest of the cast last spring to per- j
feet the idea before fall quarter j
should arrive.
'How Navy Should Be'
The show attempts to tell "how
the Navy ought to be" as it follows
the antics of three gobs, Tom, Dick i
and Harry, through Alaska, Russia, :
France, Venice, Cuba and Stanford.
Bill Edlund plays Tom; Stu Harri- |
son, Dick, and Douglas Nobles, '
Harry.
Miss Patton describes Tom as daz
zled by the native beauties; Dick as
a "wolf on the prowl"; and Harry as
handsome, but ever faithful to the
girl back home. The attempts of
Tom and Dick to crack Harry's re- '
sistance with such atomic icebergs j
as "Igloo Annie," played by Rena
Jean Black, give the show its com
edy, according to Miss Patton.
Original Music, Skits
All songs, music, dances and skits
are original this year. The chorus I
and orchestra are completely stu
dent formed and directed, and all
choreography was done by Orchesis,
so the final production should ex
emplify Stanford talent fairly well, j
believes Miss Patton.
Tickets may still be purchased to
day at the A.S.S.U. office from 9
to 5 p.m., announced Carl Data,
dramatic manager, and any tickets
remaining may be purchased at the
box office, of Memorial Theater be
fore the show. Prices arc $1.25,
$1.00, 85 cents, and 55 cents.

Tomorrow afternoon the post-war Big Red Ma
chine will show its gridiron wares before an expected
turnout of 25,000 fans. Enthusiasm has reached a
high pitch for this fray, the first in three years for
Stanford. The Stockton Commandos, who are flying

down to the game, will provide the
opposition for the untried eleven
Marchie Schwartz coaches.
What. Jne team*lacks in experi
ence, they more than make up in
zap and pep on the field. They have
been running through their practice
drills this week with a lot of spirit
and fight. The backfield features
the services of Fred Willey at full
back, who plunges through the line
in a rifcanner reminiscent of the wny
Norm Stand lee used to do it.
At the left halfback post will
be Don Lipelt, a speed merchant
from Lodi. Over at the right half
back spot is 195-pounder Gene
Martin., The fbnr backfield men
average 185 pounds. Bill Larson,
Harry Knight, and Willie Davies
handle the quarterback . chores
when Burks is not in the game.
Other backfield men likely to see
action arc Prusmack, Dick Barry,
Henry Nisscn, shifty little full
back, and Tom Ashley.

The line averages close to the 200-
pound marker, which means they'll
outweigh the opposing Stockton
Commando line about ten pounds
per man. Ric Supple and Dave De-
Swarte open at the flanker spots. At.
the inner spots of tackle and guard
are Harry Davison, big 200-pound
red-haired lineman; Harvey Dyer,
Jimmy Frye, and Bill Lundquist.
Holding down the center slot is Bob
Abrams, the Bellingham boy.
The Stockton Commandos will
offer Boh Kricgcr as their prize
package. lie is a former Dart
mouth and Philadelphia Eagles
star, and has starred for the
Stockton team all year. Another
good hackfield man is Bob Car
roll, although his past credentials
are not known. The team, like
the Stanford grid aggregation,
uses the Michigan version of the
single wing offense.
AM the trimmings that go with a
football game will be offered this
Saturday. Stockton is bringing a
band with them. Their air base in
herited the Reno Air Base band
when that base folded up. Several
bus loads of Stockton soldiers are
also making the trek to root for
their team.
Crowd estimates have ranged
from 5.000 to 25,000 persons. Many
Bny Area admirers of Stanford
plan to attend the gridiron fes
tivities of the afternoon. To many
the appearance of a Stanford foot
ball team on the field will bring
hack memories of Frankie Albert
throwing touchdown passes, Pete
Kmctovic reeling off running
plays, "Bones" Hamilton playing
sterling football, and Bobby Gray
sou leading the Vow Boys to vic
tory.

day at the A.S.S.U. office from 9
to 5 p.m., announced Carl Data,
dramatic manager, and any tickets
remaining may be purchased at the
box office, of Memorial Theater be
fore the show. Prices arc $1.25,
$1.00, 85 cents, and 55 cents.

Tomorrow afternoon the post-war Big Red Ma
chine will show its gridiron wares before an expected
turnout of 25,000 fans. Enthusiasm has reached a
high pitch for this fray, the first in three years for
Stanford. The Stockton Commandos, who are flying

down to the game, will provide the
opposition for the untried eleven
Marchie Schwartz coaches.
What. Jne team*lacks in experi
ence, they more than make up in
zap and pep on the field. They have
been running through their practice
drills this week with a lot of spirit
and fight. The backfield features
the services of Fred Willey at full
back, who plunges through the line
in a rifcanner reminiscent of the wny
Norm Stand lee used to do it.
At the left halfback post will
be Don Lipelt, a speed merchant
from Lodi. Over at the right half
back spot is 195-pounder Gene
Martin., The fbnr backfield men
average 185 pounds. Bill Larson,
Harry Knight, and Willie Davies
handle the quarterback . chores
when Burks is not in the game.
Other backfield men likely to see
action arc Prusmack, Dick Barry,
Henry Nisscn, shifty little full
back, and Tom Ashley.

The line averages close to the 200-
pound marker, which means they'll
outweigh the opposing Stockton
Commando line about ten pounds
per man. Ric Supple and Dave De-
Swarte open at the flanker spots. At.
the inner spots of tackle and guard
are Harry Davison, big 200-pound
red-haired lineman; Harvey Dyer,
Jimmy Frye, and Bill Lundquist.
Holding down the center slot is Bob
Abrams, the Bellingham boy.
The Stockton Commandos will
offer Boh Kricgcr as their prize
package. lie is a former Dart
mouth and Philadelphia Eagles
star, and has starred for the
Stockton team all year. Another
good hackfield man is Bob Car
roll, although his past credentials
are not known. The team, like
the Stanford grid aggregation,
uses the Michigan version of the
single wing offense.
AM the trimmings that go with a
football game will be offered this
Saturday. Stockton is bringing a
band with them. Their air base in
herited the Reno Air Base band
when that base folded up. Several
bus loads of Stockton soldiers are
also making the trek to root for
their team.
Crowd estimates have ranged
from 5.000 to 25,000 persons. Many
Bny Area admirers of Stanford
plan to attend the gridiron fes
tivities of the afternoon. To many
the appearance of a Stanford foot
ball team on the field will bring
hack memories of Frankie Albert
throwing touchdown passes, Pete
Kmctovic reeling off running
plays, "Bones" Hamilton playing
sterling football, and Bobby Gray
sou leading the Vow Boys to vic
tory.
Tonight for the first time since fall '41 a peare-time
Gaieties will be presented on the Stanford campus.
The title "Big Game" has not yet been restored to the
traditional Ram's Head football production, but the
directors promise that the Navy theme will supply the

same spirit. ♦
This is also the first time that |
Gaieties has attempted to build the !
entire show around one theme, car- |
rying it through all acts, songs, and
orchestral numbers. Lois Williams,
associate director, and Janice Swan,
assistant director, worked with
Mary Lou Patton, director, and the I
rest of the cast last spring to per- j
feet the idea before fall quarter j
should arrive.
'How Navy Should Be'
The show attempts to tell "how
the Navy ought to be" as it follows
the antics of three gobs, Tom, Dick i
and Harry, through Alaska, Russia, :
France, Venice, Cuba and Stanford.
Bill Edlund plays Tom; Stu Harri- |
son, Dick, and Douglas Nobles, '
Harry.
Miss Patton describes Tom as daz
zled by the native beauties; Dick as
a "wolf on the prowl"; and Harry as
handsome, but ever faithful to the
girl back home. The attempts of
Tom and Dick to crack Harry's re- '
sistance with such atomic icebergs j
as "Igloo Annie," played by Rena
Jean Black, give the show its com
edy, according to Miss Patton.
Original Music, Skits
All songs, music, dances and skits
are original this year. The chorus I
and orchestra are completely stu
dent formed and directed, and all
choreography was done by Orchesis,
so the final production should ex
emplify Stanford talent fairly well, j
believes Miss Patton.

Swarte open at the flanker spots. At.
the inner spots of tackle and guard
are Harry Davison, big 200-pound
red-haired lineman; Harvey Dyer,
Jimmy Frye, and Bill Lundquist.
Holding down the center slot is Bob
Abrams, the Bellingham boy.
The Stockton Commandos will
offer Boh Kricgcr as their prize
package. lie is a former Dart
mouth and Philadelphia Eagles
star, and has starred for the
Stockton team all year. Another
good hackfield man is Bob Car
roll, although his past credentials
are not known. The team, like
the Stanford grid aggregation,
uses the Michigan version of the
single wing offense.
AM the trimmings that go with a
football game will be offered this
Saturday. Stockton is bringing a
band with them. Their air base in
herited the Reno Air Base band
when that base folded up. Several
bus loads of Stockton soldiers are
also making the trek to root for
their team.
Crowd estimates have ranged
from 5.000 to 25,000 persons. Many
Bny Area admirers of Stanford
plan to attend the gridiron fes
tivities of the afternoon. To many
the appearance of a Stanford foot
ball team on the field will bring
hack memories of Frankie Albert
throwing touchdown passes, Pete
Kmctovic reeling off running
plays, "Bones" Hamilton playing
sterling football, and Bobby Gray
sou leading the Vow Boys to vic
tory.
Tonight for the first time since fall '41 a peare-time
Gaieties will be presented on the Stanford campus.
The title "Big Game" has not yet been restored to the
traditional Ram's Head football production, but the
directors promise that the Navy theme will supply the

same spirit. ♦
This is also the first time that |
Gaieties has attempted to build the !
entire show around one theme, car- |
rying it through all acts, songs, and
orchestral numbers. Lois Williams,
associate director, and Janice Swan,
assistant director, worked with
Mary Lou Patton, director, and the I
rest of the cast last spring to per- j
feet the idea before fall quarter j
should arrive.
'How Navy Should Be'
The show attempts to tell "how
the Navy ought to be" as it follows
the antics of three gobs, Tom, Dick i
and Harry, through Alaska, Russia, :
France, Venice, Cuba and Stanford.
Bill Edlund plays Tom; Stu Harri- |
son, Dick, and Douglas Nobles, '
Harry.
Miss Patton describes Tom as daz
zled by the native beauties; Dick as
a "wolf on the prowl"; and Harry as
handsome, but ever faithful to the
girl back home. The attempts of
Tom and Dick to crack Harry's re- '
sistance with such atomic icebergs j
as "Igloo Annie," played by Rena
Jean Black, give the show its com
edy, according to Miss Patton.
Original Music, Skits
All songs, music, dances and skits
are original this year. The chorus I
and orchestra are completely stu
dent formed and directed, and all
choreography was done by Orchesis,
so the final production should ex
emplify Stanford talent fairly well, j
believes Miss Patton.
Tickets may still be purchased to
day at the A.S.S.U. office from 9
to 5 p.m., announced Carl Data,
dramatic manager, and any tickets
remaining may be purchased at the
box office, of Memorial Theater be
fore the show. Prices arc $1.25,
$1.00, 85 cents, and 55 cents.

Tomorrow afternoon the post-war Big Red Ma
chine will show its gridiron wares before an expected
turnout of 25,000 fans. Enthusiasm has reached a
high pitch for this fray, the first in three years for
Stanford. The Stockton Commandos, who are flying

down to the game, will provide the
opposition for the untried eleven
Marchie Schwartz coaches.
What. Jne team*lacks in experi
ence, they more than make up in
zap and pep on the field. They have
been running through their practice
drills this week with a lot of spirit
and fight. The backfield features
the services of Fred Willey at full
back, who plunges through the line
in a rifcanner reminiscent of the wny
Norm Stand lee used to do it.
At the left halfback post will
be Don Lipelt, a speed merchant
from Lodi. Over at the right half
back spot is 195-pounder Gene
Martin., The fbnr backfield men
average 185 pounds. Bill Larson,
Harry Knight, and Willie Davies
handle the quarterback . chores
when Burks is not in the game.
Other backfield men likely to see
action arc Prusmack, Dick Barry,
Henry Nisscn, shifty little full
back, and Tom Ashley.

The line averages close to the 200-
pound marker, which means they'll
outweigh the opposing Stockton
Commando line about ten pounds
per man. Ric Supple and Dave De-
Swarte open at the flanker spots. At.
the inner spots of tackle and guard
are Harry Davison, big 200-pound
