YOUR VOTE FOR WORLD GOVERNMENT
Football game, rally, Gaieties—and the Atom
Bomb. . . . Headlines of today's paper are a
strange, ironical combination, as Excorn,
through the Daily, asks A.S.S.U. support of a
petition urging the immediate establishment
of a world federation strong enough to cope
cffocVively with the atomic energy problem.
In the light of yesterday's news this may
seem futile. President Truman and Prime Min
ister Attlee and King have recommended the
establishment of a U.N.O. commission that
would work toward "entirely eliminating the
use of atomic energy for destructive purposes
and promoting its widest use for industrial and
humanitarian purposes." And still the mechan
ical know-how of the bomb is to be kept secret!
At any rate, this puts the United Nations face
1o face with the atomic energy problem. But
the- United Nations Charter, as drawn up by
the long ago "pre-Hiroshima" San Francisco
Conference, is appallingly inadequate to solve
a problem which concerns the survival of civili
sation. Before August, 1945, nothing short of a
v/crii invasion could awaken or frighten na
tions to the formation of a world organization
,ibove national sovereignty. Today that poten
tial world invasion has come in the atomic
bomb.
The time is now for a relinquishing of some
national sovereignty among the United Na
tions; and the time is now for the expenditure
of an equal amount of energy, effort, and
thought toward a world federation as went
toward the development of the bomb.
That's where students at Stanford, and at
universities throughout the country, come in.
Al! their hopes for the future are bound up in
the solution of the atomic energy problem.
No student, no matter how small or insignifi
cant his voice may be, can afford to watch an
atomic bomb armament race and not do some
thing about it, something that may help to rouse
public opinion in support of the only hope—a
strong world federation. Your name on the
front-page ballot today means you're willing
to fight for it.
