Today is mystery day.
First mystery is that of the car speeding
down the gravel walk between Engineering
and English corners one afternoon this week.
It doesn't sound mysterious, but consider the

two entrances to that stretch. Both are blocked
off by white posts about two feet apart. That's
why the man-holes are stationed so near the
posts —handy for disposal of riders who try
to go between the posts in double formation.
Back to the car: it was first noticed throwing
gravel in the direction of the Romanic Lan
guages Department. It kept going, until it
reached the English Corner. There, someone
jumped out again with a big black box, and
into the car, waiting with door open and en
gine roaring like a first-class A 1 Capone hack.
Then they were off toward the Engineering
Corner again. (Better pause for a gulp of Cel
lar quality here—too much will make you
dizzy.)
A tree blocked my vision, just about the time
the car should have reached the posts. By the
time I ran around to the other side of the tree,
the car was on the other side of the posts and
roaring toward the hills. All this minus the
flap of wings or clank of a shovel.
So, it's still a mystery, and that cussed Phys
ics Department just grins atomically when you
ask what sort of little gadgets it brews down
in the basement social room.
The next mystery -what was in the box that
was rushed out of the History Building and
into the waiting car? It could have been a crate
of books, but no car would be willing to leap
poles on Quad for a crate of books. The box
was black and coffin-shaped. But no—the civ
librarian has been missing for several weeks
now.

Next is the mystery of the popular Rest Home.
They already have a full house for the week
end, and have started sending disappointed
R.H. ticket-mongers over to the A.S.S.U. office
for tickets to the Gaieties.
Mystery is, what has Mrs. Murray of Salva
tierra got that Schwartz of Stadium Way hasn't
got? True, football coaches aren't noted for
spending the half-time taking the pulses of
spectators, but give the guy a chance. It's pos
sible that he'll send his fourth string on an all
out plunge through the grandstands, distrib
uting cold pills.
Of course, there's the possibility that once
you're in the clutches of Mrs. M., you're shack
led for the week-end. Here's the plot—sneak
your pet pigeon out via the chimney and head
him toward Rally Com headquarters. Rally
Com will whirl into action at the sniff of these
stifled and shackled prospective rooters, will
fuel up the big red steam roller, and boom up
Salvatierra. They won't even bother to stop
for huffing at the door of the R.H., but will crash
on through to the bonded souls.
Liberation! And don't bother to change your
sheet—white will be the color of the day!
