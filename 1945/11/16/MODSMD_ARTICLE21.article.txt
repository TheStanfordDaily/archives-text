### Elliot Eosteen 
The Truman-Attlee-King discussions contin
ue. No doubt British credits and future foreign
policies figure in, but the atom bomb is still
the major topic of conversation.
Premier Attlee spoke to Congress Tuesday.
He outlined his government policies, and re
action to them split along lines of right and left.
However, the section in Congress that consid
ered him the big, bad, red demon of England
seems to think now that he is guite harmless,
if not a little mistaken in his outlook.
Anyway, chances of unity in the future are
better. Unity is vital, so his speech performed
a great service.
ATOM BOMB
We don't know what is being said about the
atom bomb. However, the statesmen are getting
a lot of their opinions from scientists. The Sa
vonarola-like figure of Vannevar Bush hovers
in the background of everything.
Rumors are that Truman wants to outlaw their
use. Attlee, on the other hand, is supposed to
be claiming that they can't be outlawed. His
proposal is for a policing job to be done.
WORLD GOVERNMENT?
Some other sources are thinking of world
government plans being concocted. Official
Washington, however, sneers.
The recent riots in Washington and the Arab
world over the Palestine situation are probably
a topic. Our oil interests in the Arab world,
however, should inhibit us from looking into the
dirty laundry of the British Empire, if good
manners don't. The British are being very dip
lomatic about the whole thing, subtly suggest
ing that if we want a Jewish national state, we
should really also ask for the privilege of pro
tecting it. In other words, no American guns,
no American-supported state.
Although there are many side origins and
acrimonies that might develop in these con
ferences, a spirit of unity prevails. This will
mean much in the future, so, even if nothing
definite comes out of Washington, something
will have been accomplished.
