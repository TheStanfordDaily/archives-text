# Rally Rouses Indian Spirit
## 
### BOB PECK 
A new Stanford spirit was born
last night as 2,000 students created
new enthusiasm for years to come
at th° Pavilion fotball rally.
No longer will the Farm have to
recall former years; Stanford has set
a new standard for itself, old stu
dents tiaid.
Football Again
The rally was in preparation for
Stanford's return to collegiate foot
ball for the first time in four years
against Stockton Air Base Saturday.
Bill Corbus, ail-American here in
1932 and 1933, put the issue perfectly
last night, when he said, "This is the
finest spirit that I have ever seen at
Stanford."
Spirit {iood
Marchie Schwartz, Indian football
coach, said that "if the administra
tion had known that the students
felt this way, we would have played
California this year."
The highlights of last night's rally
came when the 1945 Indian squad
came into the rally through a large
paper football in the eastern end of
the Pavilion. Then, on the floor of

the gymnasium the toam ran through
one of iheir plays.
Two new songs by Betty Steller
were introduced by Joan Bailey,
Marky Cleek, Guyla Runyan, and
Jack Taylor at the rally. Rena Jean
Black sang an old favorite by Jane
Frazier, "P.O. Blues."
Alumni Anxious
Coach Schwartz spoke briefly and
then Bill Corbus was introduced by
Wally McCall, master of ceremonies.
"All of the Farm alumni I have
talked to are going to be down here
for the Stockton game Saturday—
they are as anxious as you for Stan
ford to get back into intercollegiate
sports," Corbus said.
"Throughout the war Stanford did
a great service by holding athletics
back, for there was something more
important then," Corbus added.
Yell Leaders
Newt Arnold, Bill Lippineott, and
Charles Jackman led the student
body in the yells last night.
Ruth Levison and Wally McCall
were co-chairmen of last night's
rally. The Stanford band played
Farm songs and Ben Bok's jazz band
led the students down the Row to
the Pavilion.
