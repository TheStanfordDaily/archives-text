## 
### 
(Do you think we're going to heat Stockton? An informal campus
poll says it's hound to he close. We're matching inexperience and enthu
siasm against experience and skill. For campus opinion on Stanford's
return to athletics, see what they're saying on Quad.)
RICHARD GOLDEN: With the old-time rally spirit hack again, the
Rig Red Machine should triumph by 12 points. Look for Ashley and
Willis to run up the score.
TOM IIOOD: Saturday Stanford resumes athletics with our football
team matching its brains and brawn against Stockton. I'm looking for a
close victory by our hard-fighting men with such men as Abrams and
Supple to hold down the Commandos.
BARBARA LANG: I think it's wonderful that Stanford is again en
tering competitive sports. Our team will undoubtedly put up a terrific
light, but will have a decided disadvantage against a more experienced
team. Stockton 7. Stanford fi!
DR. EDWIN COTTRELL: This is a very welcome sight to see a Stan
ford team on the field again. It's the best thing that could have happened.
Let s hope that they'll he back in the conference next season. No. I can't
predict the score!
FRANK PAYNE: Of course we all want a victory, hut from all re
ports it looks hopeless against the experienced Stockton Air Base team.
Probable score: Stockton 14, Stanford fi!
DICK CRANE: Our team will be spurred on by the cheers of the
student body when they see the Big Red Machine roll on the field. The
score will he close—Stanford 19, Stockton fi!
JEANNE SOULE: I look forward to seeing the backbone of a great
team that can whip California utterly, next year!
MARILOU SUTTER: Wishful thinking, maybe—but I predict Stan
ford by I.J points, so we won't just have to practice going wild with
enthusiasm but really do it. It's what we've been waiting for. Score:
Stanford 20, Stockton 7!
DAN EYMANN: There is no Saturday to compare with football Sat
urdays at Stanford. We are all rooting for that Big Red Machine, but
I'm afraid their long-awaited debut will start with a loss. Stockton is
big, fast, and experienced. Score: Stockton l.'J, Stanford 0!
MARY VIRGINIA POND: If Stockton isn't better than when I saw
them play against College of Pacific, Stanford should roll over them.
Probable score: Stanford 28, Stockton 7!
ART LEVINSON, Daily Sports writer: Stanford ought to whip Stock
ton by a good margin. Watch for the accurate passing of Curt Burks to
run up the score. Big linemen like Abrams, Davison, and DeSwarte ought
to stop cold the running attack of Stockton. Probable score: Stanford 20.
Stockton G!
MARY MOORE: I think Stanford should win. After all. they have
a good team. I ve seen Curt Burks and Ric Supple play intramural foot
ball. It'll be close: Stanford 14, Stockton 7!

return to athletics, see what they're saying on Quad.)
RICHARD GOLDEN: With the old-time rally spirit hack again, the
Rig Red Machine should triumph by 12 points. Look for Ashley and
Willis to run up the score.
TOM IIOOD: Saturday Stanford resumes athletics with our football
team matching its brains and brawn against Stockton. I'm looking for a
close victory by our hard-fighting men with such men as Abrams and
Supple to hold down the Commandos.
BARBARA LANG: I think it's wonderful that Stanford is again en
tering competitive sports. Our team will undoubtedly put up a terrific
light, but will have a decided disadvantage against a more experienced
team. Stockton 7. Stanford fi!
DR. EDWIN COTTRELL: This is a very welcome sight to see a Stan
ford team on the field again. It's the best thing that could have happened.
Let s hope that they'll he back in the conference next season. No. I can't
predict the score!
FRANK PAYNE: Of course we all want a victory, hut from all re
ports it looks hopeless against the experienced Stockton Air Base team.
Probable score: Stockton 14, Stanford fi!
DICK CRANE: Our team will be spurred on by the cheers of the
student body when they see the Big Red Machine roll on the field. The
score will he close—Stanford 19, Stockton fi!
JEANNE SOULE: I look forward to seeing the backbone of a great
team that can whip California utterly, next year!
MARILOU SUTTER: Wishful thinking, maybe—but I predict Stan
ford by I.J points, so we won't just have to practice going wild with
enthusiasm but really do it. It's what we've been waiting for. Score:
Stanford 20, Stockton 7!
DAN EYMANN: There is no Saturday to compare with football Sat
urdays at Stanford. We are all rooting for that Big Red Machine, but
I'm afraid their long-awaited debut will start with a loss. Stockton is
big, fast, and experienced. Score: Stockton l.'J, Stanford 0!
MARY VIRGINIA POND: If Stockton isn't better than when I saw
them play against College of Pacific, Stanford should roll over them.
Probable score: Stanford 28, Stockton 7!
ART LEVINSON, Daily Sports writer: Stanford ought to whip Stock
ton by a good margin. Watch for the accurate passing of Curt Burks to
run up the score. Big linemen like Abrams, Davison, and DeSwarte ought
to stop cold the running attack of Stockton. Probable score: Stanford 20.
Stockton G!
MARY MOORE: I think Stanford should win. After all. they have
a good team. I ve seen Curt Burks and Ric Supple play intramural foot
ball. It'll be close: Stanford 14, Stockton 7!
