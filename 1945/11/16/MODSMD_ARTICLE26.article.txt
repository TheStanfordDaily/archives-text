# Meeting Indicates Compromise hi China, Says Shau Wing Chan
## 
### 
The meeting of a Chinese neutral
third parly November 20 is one of
many indications that the Chinese
spirit of compromise will prevail,
Dr. Shau Wing Chan, associate pro
fessor of Chinese and humanities,
told students yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Chan, presented by the World
Affairs committee of the Y.W.C.A.,
expressed hope that the common
people of China will evaluate the
Communist and Nationalist parties
on the basis of "who started to fight
first." "Neither the Communists nor
the Nationalists will long defy pub
lic opinion," he predicted.
Chinese Situation
In evaluating the present Chinese
situation, Dr. Chan first gave the
background of the Communist-Na
tionalist struggle. "The two parties
at one time had a working har
mony, based on the desire for resto
ration of political independence," he
told his audience.
When the major groups broke in
1927, Chiang Kai-shek liquidated
the leftists, and the Communists or
ganized an army for their own pro
tection. "Another period of co-op
eration took place when the Japa
nese invaded," he explained, "but
in the spring of 1940. the country
was again on the verge of civil war."
Communists and Moscow
Dr. Chan expressed the belief that
the Chinese Communists are not
completely indepenedent of Moscow,
as has been claimed. "I have seen

the picture of Lenin on their bank
notes," he said, "although whether
this indicates actual help from the
Soviet or merely a feeling of alli
ance, I would not venture to say."
In analyzing the news we hear of
China, Dr. Chan remarked, "When
ever I hear anything about China,
I will take it with two grains of
salt. One is not enough."
Are Reports True?
"Although Nationalists and Com
munists are engaged in skirmishes,
I cannot believe the reports of the
thousands of casulaties we read in
the newspapers." He explained his
skepticism on the basis that the
Chinese do not have the weapons,
and wholesale slaughter is against
the basic Chinese philosophy.
Although emphasizing that he
spoke only an opinion, Dr. Chan
predicted that the Chinese crisis
would "boil down" in two or three
months. "I don't think China could
stand another civil war after 14
years of continuous fighting," he

said.
Dr. Chun reported the Chinese ac
cuse the United States of meddling
and favoring the Chungking gov
ernment. "It seems to me fair to
help the Chinese Chungking gov
ernment recover the territory re
captured from the Japanese," he
said, "but Chinese Communists
contend they are entitled to some
of the territory.
"However, even Soviet Russia
now recognizes the Chungking Na
tionalist government as the official
government of China."

tection. "Another period of co-op
eration took place when the Japa
nese invaded," he explained, "but
in the spring of 1940. the country
was again on the verge of civil war."
Communists and Moscow
Dr. Chan expressed the belief that
the Chinese Communists are not
completely indepenedent of Moscow,
as has been claimed. "I have seen

the picture of Lenin on their bank
notes," he said, "although whether
this indicates actual help from the
Soviet or merely a feeling of alli
ance, I would not venture to say."
In analyzing the news we hear of
China, Dr. Chan remarked, "When
ever I hear anything about China,
I will take it with two grains of
salt. One is not enough."
Are Reports True?
"Although Nationalists and Com
munists are engaged in skirmishes,
I cannot believe the reports of the
thousands of casulaties we read in
the newspapers." He explained his
skepticism on the basis that the
Chinese do not have the weapons,
and wholesale slaughter is against
the basic Chinese philosophy.
Although emphasizing that he
spoke only an opinion, Dr. Chan
predicted that the Chinese crisis
would "boil down" in two or three
months. "I don't think China could
stand another civil war after 14
years of continuous fighting," he

said.
Dr. Chun reported the Chinese ac
cuse the United States of meddling
and favoring the Chungking gov
ernment. "It seems to me fair to
help the Chinese Chungking gov
ernment recover the territory re
captured from the Japanese," he
said, "but Chinese Communists
contend they are entitled to some
of the territory.
"However, even Soviet Russia
now recognizes the Chungking Na
tionalist government as the official
government of China."
The meeting of a Chinese neutral
third parly November 20 is one of
many indications that the Chinese
spirit of compromise will prevail,
Dr. Shau Wing Chan, associate pro
fessor of Chinese and humanities,
told students yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Chan, presented by the World
Affairs committee of the Y.W.C.A.,
expressed hope that the common
people of China will evaluate the
Communist and Nationalist parties
on the basis of "who started to fight
first." "Neither the Communists nor
the Nationalists will long defy pub
lic opinion," he predicted.
Chinese Situation
In evaluating the present Chinese
situation, Dr. Chan first gave the
background of the Communist-Na
tionalist struggle. "The two parties
at one time had a working har
mony, based on the desire for resto
ration of political independence," he
told his audience.
When the major groups broke in
1927, Chiang Kai-shek liquidated
the leftists, and the Communists or
ganized an army for their own pro
tection. "Another period of co-op
eration took place when the Japa
nese invaded," he explained, "but
in the spring of 1940. the country
was again on the verge of civil war."
