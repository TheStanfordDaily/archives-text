On the lop of the list of coast football games this week, for
Indian rooters, is the game tomorrow at the Stanford Stadium,
when the Stanford 1945 football squad comes up against the
Stockton Commandos.
Once again the Card rooters will be able to cheer a Stanford
team on to victory. Coach Schwartz and his squad will be out
on the field for a win tomorrow, and won't stop fighting until
they get it.
Over at Berkeley this week the tarnished Golden Bears come
up against the University of Oregon. The Webfoot halfback Jack
Leicht, like Ted Kenfield, the Cal backfield ace, is the Oregon
backfield. The game will probably go as do these two players.
CAELS OVER U.C.L.A.
St. Mary's Gaels travel south this week to play the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. This is undoubtedly the top game on the coast this
week. The kids from Moraga will go into the game as heavy
favorites over the Bruins.
The U.C.L.A. squad has been definitely weakened by the
loss of Cal Rossi, although Bill Fade, formerly of St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, Ernie Case, and Jack Boyd don't make up a weak back
field by any means. Its forward wall is a lot faster than the U.S.C.
line. St. Mary's will enter the game with the same team as it
did against the Trojans. For our money we will take the Gal
loping Gaels.
If Wedemeyer and Co. can come through this game with a
win they will undoubtedly get an invitation to the Sugar Bowl
et New Orleans January 1.
WELCH OUT
Washington comes up against Idaho this week. The game
should turn out to be a victory without too much effort on the
part of Coach "Pest" Welch's boys from Washington.
The news leaked down this way via the alumni grapevine
that this will be Welch's last season at Washington. The Hus
kies, we hear, are going all out for football next season. The
rumor has it that they are attempting to get Jock Sutherland as
head coach. The price is 520,000. We wonder where all the
money is coming from.
At San Francisco, on Sunday, the Airdevils of St. Mary's
Pre-Flight come up against the El Toro Marines. Although the
Marines are favorites, an upset would be no surprise. The Pre-
Flighters haven't got Frankie Albert this week as the little field
general has signed to play pro ball with the Los Angeles bull
dogs, but they still have the Fordham ace Len Eshmont. This
will be the last chance for Bay Area fans to see the Airdevils.
The coast schedule this week is rounded out by the Wash
ington State-Oregon State game. This should be a victory for
Oregon.

will be the last chance for Bay Area fans to see the Airdevils.
The coast schedule this week is rounded out by the Wash
ington State-Oregon State game. This should be a victory for
Oregon.
On the lop of the list of coast football games this week, for
Indian rooters, is the game tomorrow at the Stanford Stadium,
when the Stanford 1945 football squad comes up against the
Stockton Commandos.
Once again the Card rooters will be able to cheer a Stanford
team on to victory. Coach Schwartz and his squad will be out
on the field for a win tomorrow, and won't stop fighting until
they get it.
Over at Berkeley this week the tarnished Golden Bears come
up against the University of Oregon. The Webfoot halfback Jack
Leicht, like Ted Kenfield, the Cal backfield ace, is the Oregon
backfield. The game will probably go as do these two players.
CAELS OVER U.C.L.A.
St. Mary's Gaels travel south this week to play the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. This is undoubtedly the top game on the coast this
week. The kids from Moraga will go into the game as heavy
favorites over the Bruins.
The U.C.L.A. squad has been definitely weakened by the
loss of Cal Rossi, although Bill Fade, formerly of St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, Ernie Case, and Jack Boyd don't make up a weak back
field by any means. Its forward wall is a lot faster than the U.S.C.
line. St. Mary's will enter the game with the same team as it
did against the Trojans. For our money we will take the Gal
loping Gaels.
If Wedemeyer and Co. can come through this game with a
win they will undoubtedly get an invitation to the Sugar Bowl
et New Orleans January 1.
WELCH OUT
Washington comes up against Idaho this week. The game
should turn out to be a victory without too much effort on the
part of Coach "Pest" Welch's boys from Washington.
The news leaked down this way via the alumni grapevine
that this will be Welch's last season at Washington. The Hus
kies, we hear, are going all out for football next season. The
rumor has it that they are attempting to get Jock Sutherland as
head coach. The price is 520,000. We wonder where all the
money is coming from.
At San Francisco, on Sunday, the Airdevils of St. Mary's
Pre-Flight come up against the El Toro Marines. Although the
Marines are favorites, an upset would be no surprise. The Pre-
Flighters haven't got Frankie Albert this week as the little field
general has signed to play pro ball with the Los Angeles bull
dogs, but they still have the Fordham ace Len Eshmont. This
will be the last chance for Bay Area fans to see the Airdevils.
