# AST Casaba Teams Clash
## 
### 
Two ERC teams and two EM out
fits remained in the running for the
AST basketball championship after
Wednesday night's quarter-finals
weeded out four more contenders of
the sixteen-team elimination tour
nament. The Li 1' Papooses (ERC)
now clash with the Bullets (EM) in
the first bracket semifinals, while
the Corsairs (ERC) tangle with the
Vita-Men (EM) in the lower section.
Second round action witnessed one
notable upset as the Lil' Papooses
toppled the Coots, 2G-14. Up until
this time the Coots had dropped but
on? tilt and that by only one point.
The Coots advantage in age and ex
perience was expected to be a factor
in their favor. The Lil' Papooses,
however, put on an exhibition of
some snappy shooting and sound all
around playing and consequently
had little difficulty in emerging on
top of the heap.
The Lil' Papoose opponent in one
semifinal brawl will be the Bullets
who advanced ot round three by vir
tue of a 28-15 verdict over the Lily
whiters. The Lilywhiters had also
lost but one contest and it too was
a single point margin affair. In the
second half the Bullets turned loose
the scoring prowess of Braun and
March and finished the game win
ning easily.
The lower bracket contests were
decided in the expected manner al
though the Vita-Men's 25-20 deci
sion over the B.F.'s was far closer
than expected. In the evening's
fourth tilt the Buzz-Bombs failed to
repeat their role as upsetters and
fell victims to the Corsairs.
The semifinals will be played to
night (Thursday) while the cham
pionship bout will probably be next
Tuesday night in the Pavilion.
This afternoon at 4:15 the Army's
All-Star aggregation will offer some
game practice to Coach Dean's var
sity cage combinations.
