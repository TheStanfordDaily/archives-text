# Daily Gridiron Experts Pick Football Games
## 
### 
Despite deep study and philosoph- t
ieal contemplation, the Daily board
of grid experts has managed to find ,
time to bring their outstanding pre
dictions to readers of the only morn- j
ing newspaper on the peninsula.
This week the grid gue&sers are
Bob Slobe, who up to this date has i
76 per cent; Jim Welter, who also
claims 7G per cent; Art Levinson, j
who adds another voice to 76 per
cent; A 1 Sciaroni, who has 74 per
cent; B<>b Gilkey, who holds down
72 per cent; and Marchie Schwartz,
who is low man with 69 per cent
marks. Guest predictor for this week j
is Paula Nusser, who otherwise hi- J
bernates over on the editorial side
ol the Daily. Our last feminine pre
dictor, Cathryn Owen, made the en- j
viable score of 66 per cent when she j
called the football shots.
