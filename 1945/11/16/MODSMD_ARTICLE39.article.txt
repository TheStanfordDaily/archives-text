# Winters Analyzes Works Of American Poet, Crane
## 
### 
Speaking as friend and as critic
of Hart Crane, American poet of
the l!)20's, Yvor Winters, associate
professor of English, pointed out to
an American Studies Symposium
audience yesterday how the life of
Crane, which ended in suicide, and
his work, which was obscure at best,
were the consequences of his appli
cation of the philosophical principles
of Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Emerson is much quoted and little
understood, according to Mr. Win
ters. The early American writer
merely re-stated, in the language of
the Calvinistic pulpit, the common
place Romantic ideas of the "beati
tude of ignorance," "the surrender
to impulse as a guide to action," "the
doctrine of equivalence" and the
literary notion of "automatic writ
ing" ro "expressionism."
Influence of Emerson
As the result of correspondence
and conversation with Crane in the
late 'twenties, Mr. Winters believes
that Crane understood the doctrines

which he received from Emerson
and from the poetry of Whitman but
was unable to evaluate them. Being
an intelligent man, he was con
cerned with the ends of his philoso
phy which were disastrous to his
life and his work.
The speaker, who has published
poetry and criticism, asserted that
the full significance of Emerson's
thinking is not realized by many
who teach American history and
literature in the universities of the
country.
Meaning of "Bridge"
"The Bridge," which Crane pub
lished in 11)30, was interpreted by
Mr. Winters as the expression of a
young American's awakening love
for his country. In the poem, which
is in two sections, each divided into
separate poems, the sequences deal
with different events in United
States history or sections of the
country. In the prologue the Brook
lyn Bridge is the symbol of modern
America.
Mr. Winters selected parts of
Ihe sequences, "The River," "The
Dance," and the last, "Atlantis," as
high in Romantic verse.—Pinkerton
