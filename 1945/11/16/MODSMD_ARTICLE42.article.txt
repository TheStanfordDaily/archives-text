## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (UP). |
— President Truman and the |
Prime Ministers of Great Britain
and Canada concluded their atom
ic bomb control talks today with
the announcement that the me
chanical know-how of bomb pro- j
duction would continue to be kept
secret.
They recommended the establish- j
ment of a commission under the i
United Nations Organization. The i
commission, they said, would work '
toward "entirely eliminating the use j
of atomic energy for destructive j
purposes and promoting its widest
use for industrial and humanitarian
purposes."
The statement of policy drafted
by the three leaders advocated the
widest exchange of basic scientific
knowledge, but expressed the be
lief "that the spreading of the
specialized information regarding
the practical application of atomic
energy" for military purposes
would not contribute to a con
structive solution of the problem
of the atomic bomb.
"We are not convinced," the state
ment. signed by the three leaders
said, "that the spreading of the
specialized information regarding
the practical application of atomic
energy before it is possible to de
vise effective reciprocal and en
forceable safeguards acceptable to

all nations, would contribute to a
constructive solution of the problem
of the atomic bomb.
"On the contrary, we think it
might have the opposite effect.
We are, however, prepared to
share on a reciprocal basis with
other United Nations detailed in
formation concerning the practi
cal industrial application of atom
ic energy just as soon as effective

enforceable safeguards against its
use for destructive purposes can
be devised."
The commission, according to the
plan outlined in the communique,
should be instructed to proceed im
mediately to prepare recommenda
tions, The commission would be
called upon to make specic propo
sals:
1. For extending between all
nations the exchange of basic sci
entific information for peaceful
ends.
2. For control of atomic energy
to the extent necessary to ensure
its use only for peaceful purposes.
3. For the elimination from
national armaments of atomic
weapons and of all other major
weapons adaptable to mass de
struction.
4. For effective safeguards by
way of inspection and other means
to protect complying states against
the hazards of violations and eva
sions.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (UP). |
— President Truman and the |
Prime Ministers of Great Britain
and Canada concluded their atom
ic bomb control talks today with
the announcement that the me
chanical know-how of bomb pro- j
duction would continue to be kept
secret.
They recommended the establish- j
ment of a commission under the i
United Nations Organization. The i
commission, they said, would work '
toward "entirely eliminating the use j
of atomic energy for destructive j
purposes and promoting its widest
use for industrial and humanitarian
purposes."
The statement of policy drafted
by the three leaders advocated the
widest exchange of basic scientific
knowledge, but expressed the be
lief "that the spreading of the
specialized information regarding
the practical application of atomic
energy" for military purposes
would not contribute to a con
structive solution of the problem
of the atomic bomb.
