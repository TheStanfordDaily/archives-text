# Guerard Stresses Direct Referendum As Main Factor in French Elections
## 
### 
Albert L. Guerard, professor of
general literature and noted nuthoiv
ity on France, expressed the belief
today that the most important fac
tor in the recent French general
elections was the use of the direct
referendum. "As to the election it
self, there was no doubt that the
party backed by General Charles De
Gaulle would be the victor," he
added.
In the elections the people of
France—women, too, for the first
time — voted directly on the ideas,
with little interference of political
machinery. "In my opinion," said
Mr. Guerard, "this trend toward di
rect voting is becoming more and
more important in all nations with
the new shift toward Socialism and
Communism, and should eventually
be adopted in the United States."
1575 Constitution
The French elections show the
complete collapse of the Radical -
Socialist party, a professional po
litical party which had been the
central control of France for 40
years. "In choosing this Fourth Re
public, which is a coalition between
the Communists, Socialists, and
Popular Republicans, the French
didn't condemn the Third Republic.
Instead, they voted against the old
constitution of 1875," Mr. Guerard
explained. "The constitution served
during a successful period of French
history, but the nation is moving on
to new things."
General De' Gaulle was recently
elected head of the Constituent As
sembly, a provisional government
charged with giving France a con
stitution which will usher in the
Fourth Republic. His complete en
dorsement by the French people was
shown by the fact that no dissent
ing vote was cast against him. One
anti-Communist refused to agree
with any Communist, so he simply
didn't vote.
New Party
A new feature in French politics
is the development of a third party,
the Popular Republican, with Bi
dault as the leader. This party a
result of resistance groups formed

( during the war, is comparatively
conservative, but willing to accept
Socialism. II is composed chiefly
of Catholics, but only because the
i majority of Frenchmen arc Catho
| lies, not because it is a clerical
j party.
"The program and plan of action
I planned by the resistance party,"
i stated Mr. Guerard, "would be
| great enough to keep the present
| Constituent Assembly busy for the
I next seven months—its term of of
j fice."
Domestic Agreement
In discussing the international
importance of the elections, Mr.
Guerard showed that the Commu
nists and Socialists agree at home,
but their difference lies in their in
ternational policy. "The Commu
nists are still faithful to Moscow
and are against any alliance that
might be directed against Russia,"
he explained. "They are in favor of
continuing the present system of al
liances and maintaining the French
treaty with Russia, while the So
cialists advocate complete interna
tional union, and alliances with
England, the United States, and all
of Western Europe."
An interesting feature of the elec
tions is that they show the direct
continuation of the general trend
that started in 1936 with Leon Blum
and the "Front Populairc." The in
terim of the Vichy government
might not have been, and matters
I have developed as they normally
| would have.
Shift to Left
"It is interesting to note," con
cluded Mr. Guerard, "that there
has been the same gradual growth
of the Republican, Socialist, and
Communist parties and shifting to
the left that would have been, de
spite the war and internal strife of
these last years. In French politics
there is a deep current present that
withstands all manner of surface
agitation."
