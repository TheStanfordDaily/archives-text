# Calendars Sell Monday
## 
### 
Cap and Gown calendars go on
sale Monday from 11 a.m. to 1:30
p.m. at the Cellar and Post Office,
announced President Barbara Lamb
yesterday.
The calendars are a new size this
year, Miss Lamb said. They will be
smaller, with a page for every week,
instead of one for each month as
they formerly had. Fifty-two pho
tographs of campus scenes, done in
sepia-tone, will decorate each page,
said Miss Lamb. Ed McLellan did
most of the photography for the cal
endar, she added.
In spite of the increased number
of pages, the calendars will still sell
at their usual price of one dollar,
and purchasers will be limited to
five calendars apieceâ€”"in order to
give everyone a chance to own one,"
said Miss Lamb. Proceeds from the
sales go to the Cap and Gown Schol
arship Fund.
Cap and Gown members will also
have calendars for salo in their
rooms, Miss Lamb added. She said
that only a few calendars arc being
released at a time, in order to have
some left for purchasers who may
want them for Christmas presents.
