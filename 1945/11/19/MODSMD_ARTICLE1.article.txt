# Gaieties Rates Praise For Costumes, Dances
## 
### 
Despite the liability of an unco
ordinated and unrehearsed orches
tra, Ram's Head '45 Gaieties, "A Girl
in Every Port," Friday and Satur
day nights represented a success in
student production unequalcd for
several years.
Consistent in its approach as a
college show only, the theme pro
vided the cast wi'h sufficient op
portunity to show their talents
without straining for absent ability,
and allowed the audience to relax
without fearing obscene attempts at
humor.
Undoubtedly the most outstand
ing memories of the production
are the dances and costumes. Sel
dom before have the Gaieties pre
sented such a colorful appear
ance throughout each act with
an individual touch of dance and
costume originality and enjoyable
presentation.
Particularly fine was the Russian
dance. Klaas 801, Don Biggs, Ed
Marion, and Les Tint did the Rus
sian hopak with enthusiasm and
precision, and the rest of the danc
ers acted as though they were en
joying their Russian shirts and bag
gy trousers.
The Cuban scene, obviously in
spired with the idea of being ex
ceptional, fell flat Friday night due
to the inexpert application of fluo
rescent paint which made the danc
ers look like so many skeletons.
Without that error, the scene would
have been one of the more out
standing, which it apparently was
on Saturday night.
The Alaskan dance was good,
with a touch admirably carried
off by the dancers when each one
squeaked as she slid down the
slide. The dancers succeeded in
laughing with the audience as the
last one squeaked onto the stage. |
O. D. Phillips deserves credit not j
only for her direction of much of j
the choreography, but also for her j
dance in the Venice scene. Her 1
dance and comedy were done with J
a great deal of stage presence.
The "Can-Can" dance in the j
French sccnc was good. The tech- ;
nique in the Apache dance was al- j
most professional, although the 1
dance seemed superfluous in that I
scene. The Apache dancers were

Ramona Rcid and "Doc" Rogers.
Se(s throughout were very line,
with the Venetian gondola, Alas
kan igloo, French sidewalk cafe,
Russian hang-out, and "Queen
Mary" particularly good.
Most of the songs were very mem
orable. Especially well-received by
the audience was the tune "Champs-
Elysee" sung by Don Scott in the
French scene. Words and music
were by Jo Green. Which brings up
one question — why was Beatrice
Callejo, the artist girl who stood
with Don Scott at the end of that
scene, so sadly neglected during the
rest of the show? She had person
ality which caught audience notice
after only three minutes on the stage.
The song "Popolovski's" was ex
ceptional, but was so buried under
a poor orchestral accompaniment
that it did not receive the applause
it should have. The "Drinking

Song" was also good, and these two
songs were part of the reason that
the audience broke into the scene
with applause, something that hap
pened very seldom on Friday night.
Jo Green wrote "Popolovski's," and
Lois Williams (he "Drinking Song."
"Everything a Sailor Dreams
Of," sung by Don Scott and also
written by Jo Green, was quite
successful. Don Scott did a nice
job of singing the more senti
mental ballads of the show.
Other songs which were very
good were "Strip Polka," "You Can
Easily Sec," and "Don't Stand a
Chance."
Rena Jean Black made hits of
two .scenes with her personality and
singing. The "Strip Polka" was put
over with a flourish, and the final
scene entitled the "Dorm" was one
of the best in the production. The
songs in the "Dorm Scene," "Why Is
It?" "Please Come Home," and
"Let's Make It a Twosome," were
written by Jane Frasier and the au
dience seemed to like them. Cer
tainly this scene was one of the
best due principally to the songs
and Miss Black's presentation of
them.

by Margery Dickenson and Jack
Taylor was adequate, with Miss
Dickenson's voice quite enjoy
able.
The girl who sang "Don't Stand
a Chance," Barbara Welch did a
wonderful job of making something
exceptional out of a mediocre song.
The audience reaction on this one
was one of the best.
'"The All or Nothin'" scene with
George Eckstein and Larry Frank
ley was also good, especially the
"girl's" fine voice.
Without a doubt one of the most
outstanding numbers of all was
the piano solo by Don Toussaint.
Ilis playing was very (inc. and the
audicncc clapped for more until
the curtain was finally rung up
on the next scene.
Comedy and originality were well
done throughout, with particularly
fine touches such as the make-up
job on Duane Heath making him a
twin brother to "Mr. Chips," the
penguin, played by Murray Stirton,
which ran rampant through the Es
kimo scene, and the acts between
(he scenes.
Well received was the notice
posted in the middle of a kiss that
the show had been "reviewed by
Excom."
Although the production was
predominantly one for an entire
cast, many individual perform
ances were outstanding. Bill Ed
lund as Tom had an opportunity
to show his personality to great
advantage, and Stu Harrison as
Dick and Douglas Nobles as Har
ry both played their parts well.
Newt Arnold as the somewhat
wolfish Joe provided several
laughs.
The show definitely dragged in
several places. The Opener and
Closer were rather weak and slow,
with a long embarrassing pause in
the Closer probably caused by the
orchestra not picking up its cue.
Certainly Mary Lou Patton, as
director, presented an excellent
show in very good taste. It was
easy to see that (his year's Gaie
ties had had much thought and
preparation and very competent
direction.—Marion Morrow

O. D. Phillips deserves credit not j
only for her direction of much of j
the choreography, but also for her j
dance in the Venice scene. Her 1
dance and comedy were done with J
a great deal of stage presence.
The "Can-Can" dance in the j
French sccnc was good. The tech- ;
nique in the Apache dance was al- j
most professional, although the 1
dance seemed superfluous in that I
scene. The Apache dancers were

Ramona Rcid and "Doc" Rogers.
Se(s throughout were very line,
with the Venetian gondola, Alas
kan igloo, French sidewalk cafe,
Russian hang-out, and "Queen
Mary" particularly good.
Most of the songs were very mem
orable. Especially well-received by
the audience was the tune "Champs-
Elysee" sung by Don Scott in the
French scene. Words and music
were by Jo Green. Which brings up
one question — why was Beatrice
Callejo, the artist girl who stood
with Don Scott at the end of that
scene, so sadly neglected during the
rest of the show? She had person
ality which caught audience notice
after only three minutes on the stage.
The song "Popolovski's" was ex
ceptional, but was so buried under
a poor orchestral accompaniment
that it did not receive the applause
it should have. The "Drinking

Song" was also good, and these two
songs were part of the reason that
the audience broke into the scene
with applause, something that hap
pened very seldom on Friday night.
Jo Green wrote "Popolovski's," and
Lois Williams (he "Drinking Song."
"Everything a Sailor Dreams
Of," sung by Don Scott and also
written by Jo Green, was quite
successful. Don Scott did a nice
job of singing the more senti
mental ballads of the show.
Other songs which were very
good were "Strip Polka," "You Can
Easily Sec," and "Don't Stand a
Chance."
Rena Jean Black made hits of
two .scenes with her personality and
singing. The "Strip Polka" was put
over with a flourish, and the final
scene entitled the "Dorm" was one
of the best in the production. The
songs in the "Dorm Scene," "Why Is
It?" "Please Come Home," and
"Let's Make It a Twosome," were
written by Jane Frasier and the au
dience seemed to like them. Cer
tainly this scene was one of the
best due principally to the songs
and Miss Black's presentation of
them.

'"The All or Nothin'" scene with

the piano solo by Don Toussaint.

fine touches such as the make-up

twin brother to "Mr. Chips," the
penguin, played by Murray Stirton,
which ran rampant through the Es

Well received was the notice

Newt Arnold as the somewhat

The show definitely dragged in
several places. The Opener and

with a long embarrassing pause in
the Closer probably caused by the
orchestra not picking up its cue.

the audience was the tune "Champs-
Elysee" sung by Don Scott in the
French scene. Words and music
were by Jo Green. Which brings up
one question — why was Beatrice
Callejo, the artist girl who stood
with Don Scott at the end of that
scene, so sadly neglected during the
rest of the show? She had person
ality which caught audience notice
after only three minutes on the stage.
The song "Popolovski's" was ex
ceptional, but was so buried under
a poor orchestral accompaniment
that it did not receive the applause
it should have. The "Drinking

Song" was also good, and these two
songs were part of the reason that
the audience broke into the scene
with applause, something that hap
pened very seldom on Friday night.
Jo Green wrote "Popolovski's," and
Lois Williams (he "Drinking Song."
"Everything a Sailor Dreams
Of," sung by Don Scott and also
written by Jo Green, was quite
successful. Don Scott did a nice
job of singing the more senti
mental ballads of the show.
Other songs which were very
good were "Strip Polka," "You Can
Easily Sec," and "Don't Stand a
Chance."
Rena Jean Black made hits of
two .scenes with her personality and
singing. The "Strip Polka" was put
over with a flourish, and the final
scene entitled the "Dorm" was one
of the best in the production. The
songs in the "Dorm Scene," "Why Is
It?" "Please Come Home," and
"Let's Make It a Twosome," were
written by Jane Frasier and the au
dience seemed to like them. Cer
tainly this scene was one of the
best due principally to the songs
and Miss Black's presentation of
them.

by Margery Dickenson and Jack
Taylor was adequate, with Miss
Dickenson's voice quite enjoy
able.
The girl who sang "Don't Stand
a Chance," Barbara Welch did a
wonderful job of making something
exceptional out of a mediocre song.
The audience reaction on this one
was one of the best.
'"The All or Nothin'" scene with
George Eckstein and Larry Frank
ley was also good, especially the
"girl's" fine voice.
Without a doubt one of the most
outstanding numbers of all was
the piano solo by Don Toussaint.
Ilis playing was very (inc. and the
audicncc clapped for more until
the curtain was finally rung up
on the next scene.
Comedy and originality were well
done throughout, with particularly
fine touches such as the make-up
job on Duane Heath making him a
twin brother to "Mr. Chips," the
penguin, played by Murray Stirton,
which ran rampant through the Es
kimo scene, and the acts between
(he scenes.
Well received was the notice
posted in the middle of a kiss that
the show had been "reviewed by
Excom."
Although the production was
predominantly one for an entire
cast, many individual perform
ances were outstanding. Bill Ed
lund as Tom had an opportunity
to show his personality to great
advantage, and Stu Harrison as
Dick and Douglas Nobles as Har
ry both played their parts well.
Newt Arnold as the somewhat
wolfish Joe provided several
laughs.
The show definitely dragged in
several places. The Opener and
Closer were rather weak and slow,
with a long embarrassing pause in
the Closer probably caused by the
orchestra not picking up its cue.
Certainly Mary Lou Patton, as
director, presented an excellent
show in very good taste. It was
easy to see that (his year's Gaie
ties had had much thought and
preparation and very competent
direction.—Marion Morrow
Despite the liability of an unco
ordinated and unrehearsed orches
tra, Ram's Head '45 Gaieties, "A Girl
in Every Port," Friday and Satur
day nights represented a success in
student production unequalcd for
several years.
Consistent in its approach as a
college show only, the theme pro
vided the cast wi'h sufficient op
portunity to show their talents
without straining for absent ability,
and allowed the audience to relax
without fearing obscene attempts at
humor.
Undoubtedly the most outstand
ing memories of the production
are the dances and costumes. Sel
dom before have the Gaieties pre
sented such a colorful appear
ance throughout each act with
an individual touch of dance and
costume originality and enjoyable
presentation.
Particularly fine was the Russian
dance. Klaas 801, Don Biggs, Ed
Marion, and Les Tint did the Rus
sian hopak with enthusiasm and
precision, and the rest of the danc
ers acted as though they were en
joying their Russian shirts and bag
gy trousers.
The Cuban scene, obviously in
spired with the idea of being ex
ceptional, fell flat Friday night due
to the inexpert application of fluo
rescent paint which made the danc
ers look like so many skeletons.
Without that error, the scene would
have been one of the more out
standing, which it apparently was
on Saturday night.
The Alaskan dance was good,
with a touch admirably carried
off by the dancers when each one
squeaked as she slid down the
slide. The dancers succeeded in
laughing with the audience as the
last one squeaked onto the stage. |
O. D. Phillips deserves credit not j
only for her direction of much of j
the choreography, but also for her j
dance in the Venice scene. Her 1
dance and comedy were done with J
a great deal of stage presence.
The "Can-Can" dance in the j
French sccnc was good. The tech- ;
nique in the Apache dance was al- j
most professional, although the 1
dance seemed superfluous in that I
scene. The Apache dancers were

Ramona Rcid and "Doc" Rogers.
Se(s throughout were very line,
with the Venetian gondola, Alas
kan igloo, French sidewalk cafe,
Russian hang-out, and "Queen
Mary" particularly good.
Most of the songs were very mem
orable. Especially well-received by
