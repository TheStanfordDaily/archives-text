# China Talk Set for 7:30
## 
### 
Dr. "Jimmy" Yen, 52 - year - old
American - educated Chinese who
has taught reading and writing to
more than 60 million fellow coun
trymen, will discuss "China's New
Role" at a special lecture tonight at
7:30 in Cubberley Hall.
Dr. Yen, who has been called "one
of the world's most exciting men,"
is the founder and leader of the Chi
nese Mass Education Movement.
He received his early education in
studying the classics at his father's
feet, but balanced it ofT with de
grees at Yale and Princeton. He
began his unique educational ex
periment in World War I when lie
was with the Army Y.M.C.A. in
France supervising 200,000 Chinese
laborers imported by the Allies to
dig trenches, build roads and work
in factories.
Basic Chinese Vocabulary
Asked by scores of these Chinese
to write their letters home for them,
Dr. Yen developed a basic Chinese
vocabulary of about 1300 characters
streamlined from the 30,000 char
acters of the classical Chinese lan
guage. Returning to China after the
war, he began his mass education
work in one province in Central
China. During that period, from
1022 to 11)20, more than 10 million
people learned to read and write.
Since then, with the movement fi
nanced entirely by the Nationalist
Government, 47 million more have
been educated.
Dr. Yen predicts that within 10
years there will be no illiteracy in
China.
Simplified Language* System
Under his simplified language
system a person can have a vocabu
lary of some 10,000 words. The sys
tem can be mastered in 06 hours of
straight studying and the cost is 12
cents a personâ€”expense of the four
essential readers.
The internationally famous Chi
nese educator is in San Francisco to
speak before groups interested in
the Chinese Mass Education Move
ment. On his return to China, he
will head the National Commission
of Mass Education there.
Mass Education Work
In addition to his mass education
work, Dr. Yen is a member of the
People's Political Council and is
president of the National College of
Rural Reconstruction at Chungking.
| He has been a counsellor for the
Supreme Council for National De
i fense.
Dr. Yen has received honorary
j degrees from many American uni
versities. In May, 1943, at a cele
bration of the 400 th anniversary of
the death of Copernicus, he received
:i Copernican Citation as one of the
ten outstanding "modern revolu
tionaries," others including Albert
Einstein, Henry Forda nd Orville
; Wright.
The public is invited to attend Dr.
I Yen's lecture.
