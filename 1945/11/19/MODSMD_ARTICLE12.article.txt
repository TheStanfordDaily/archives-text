# Student Petition on World Federation Washington Bound
## 
### 
Petitions showing support by 50(5
students of Stanford University for
the control of atomic energy by
means of a world federation will be
::ent immediately to high govern
ment officials, announced A.S.S.U.
Vice-President Charmian Kolar last
night.
This decision was reached fol
lowing a student poll on the sub
ject, conducted through the Daily
last Friday. As yet, the Eneina tally
has not been reported, Miss Kolar
said.
Go to Truman, Byrnes, McMahon
The petitions will be sent to Pres
ident Truman, Secretary of State
James Byrnes, and Brien McMahon
of the Senate Military Affairs Com
mittee, and will advocate the imme

diate establishment of a world fed
eration, superior to the sovexeignty
of individual nations, for controlling
atomic energy.
According to Miss Kolar the peti
tions will read:
"At Stanford University, 50(i
people have petitioned for the
following: In view of the grave
challenge to our security and the
peace of (he world as presented
by (he atomic bomb, we, (he un
dersigned members of (lie Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, feel compelled to give our
immediate support toward the es
tablishment of a world federation,
above national sovereignty, that
can effectively and co-operatively
control atomic energy."

The petition
was prepared on
Wednesday eve
ning by Excom
members who
decided student
opinion on this
problem of na
tion - wide con
cern should be
heard. It was felt
that a "yes or

no" ballot would
be inconsistent with the nature of
the petition, which was designed
simply to obtain a tally of students
supporting the move for a world
federation.
How Balloting Was Conducted
The ballot, wording of which is
included in the petition, was printed
in Friday's Daily. Ballot boxes were
set up in the lobbies of Branner,
Union, Ruble, Lagunita, Eneina, and
Toyon. Other boxes were placed on
Engineering and English corners to
collect the votes of other students.
Excom action on the subject was
taken following receipt of letters
from other colleges urging support
of till universities toward the forma
tion of a world federation to control
use of atomic energy.
Urged to Write Congressmen
Students are also urged to write

letters to their Congressmen imme
diately, giving their opinions on a
subject which concerns every citi
zen of the United States. Letters
may be addressed to President Tru
man, Secretary of State Byrnes,
Senator McMahon, or Senators
Sheridan Downey or William
Knowland of California.
