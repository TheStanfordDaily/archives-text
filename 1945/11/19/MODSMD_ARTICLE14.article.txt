# Football Spirit Revived As Red Machine Returns
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
Nearly 2,100 whooping Indians let
loose three year's store of noise Sat
urday, when the resurrected Red
Machine rolled against the Stockton
Commandos in the Stanford Stadium.
Though some of the finished
touches of pre-war Indian rooting
sections were missing, the white
clad Stanfordites replaced any for
mer trimmings with a constant roar
of planned and spontaneous yells,
clapping, and stamping foot. There
were few red and white pom-poms,
which all women rooters were re
quired to be equipped with at pre
war games.
Rooting Section Traditions
The tradition of dividing the root
ing section—men on one side and
women on the other—was retained
at the game Saturday, however. An
other pre-war trimming missing was
card stnnts, which Rally Com has
promised to bring back for the first
conference games next fall.
Even though the rooters enthusi
astically sang a few of the favorite
Stanford songs, one of the most ob
vious failings with the section was
the lack of the Stanford band.
Through some misunderstanding, the
band failed to appear, and keeping
the sprawled section singing the
same tune and in the same tempo
was left entirely to Newt Arnold,
head yell leader, and Bill Lippincott

] ;ind Ch.irlc.s Jackman, his assistants.
I Touch of Rivalry
Rooters turned their attention from
the big Stockton team at various in
tervals and concentrated on Cal-
Stanford rivalry. Several yellow
coats and sweaters were removed,
by request of chant, and a group of
Merchant Marine Cadets near the
rooting section were asked to "Take
off that gold braid." Most of the
"yellow chanting" was conccntrated
on one woman sitting to the right
of the section, who was wearing a
'■ hat topped by a big gold feather.
( The woman didn't move nor remove
[ her hat all during the chanting, how
j ever. Her hair was rolled onto a
J band on the hat.
Commando Rooters Lacking
Though approximately 10,000 peo
ple were scattered throughout the
Stadium (capacity 00,000), the Stock
ton side looked like a slightly moth
eaten honeycomb from the Stanford
section. Very few Commando rooters
arrived from Stockton, and the ma
jority of that section was composed
of people who were merely anti-
Stanford.
Stanford's second game has been
scheduled for Dec. 1, with the strong
San Mateo Merchant Marine Cadets,
who have won eight out of nine
games this season. The Cadets have
announced that they plan to bring
their own rooting section and band.
