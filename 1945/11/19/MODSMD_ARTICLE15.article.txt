### 
Grover Miller-Barbara Beardslee
yesterday won the finals match of
the University mixed doubles tour
nament when they defeated George
Leong-Tappy Kimball, 3-6, 6-4, 8-6.
Tlie match was played before a
large chilled crowd on the Varsity
courts. After the match, the Roos
Bros, cup was presented to Miss
Beardslee and Miller.
Miller, playing with a leg injury,
and Miss Beardslee serving beauti
fully, overcame a first set deficit and
went on to win the next two tightly
played :;ets.
Evenly Matched
There was really little to choose
from between the two teams. Leong's
playing, which has been a standout
in the tournament, was a little wild
today and many of his shots went
into the net. Miss Kimball, whose
service is noticeably weak, played
a beautiful game from the back
court line and time after time had
to rally with Miss Beardslee and
Miller singlehanded. Most of the
backcourt shots were directed at
Miss Kimball.
Winners Excel! at Net
Miller's drop shots were beautiful
in the finals match. Although some
what handicapped by the leg injury,
Miller saved many points by his
beautiful net game. Miss Beardslee
was also adept at the net and had
many excellent placement shots.
If there was any difference be
tween the two teams it would be in
the net game. Miss Beardslee and
Miller had constant control of the
net and won most of their points
here.
Third Set Thrilling
The third set was the most excit
ing of the trio. Miller and Miss
Beardslee took a 4-1 lead only to
have Leong and Miss Kimball rally
to tie it up, 4-4. Then Miller and
Beardslee'took a 5-4 lead only to
have it tied up again. Then the score
went to 6-6 and finally the winners
outlasted Lcong and Miss Kimball
to win, 3-6.
After the match was won by Mill
er and Miss Beardslee, they wore
presented the Roos Bros, cup by
Connie Wheeler, memher of the ten
is committee. The cup was presented
to the University in 1939 and was
last offered in 1942.
The match was well received by
an enthusiastic audience. Many ten
nis fans turned out to sec the finals
in the five-week tournament.
