ATOMIC SCIENTISTS PETITION
To the Editor:
The Daily mentioned the other morning that
I had been circulating for faculty signatures a
statement recommending international control
of atomic weapons. After the paper appeared
a number of faculty members wondered why
they had not had a chance to sign, so I would
like to explain.
The statement was sent to me by a new or
ganization known as the Federation of Atomic
Scientists, a name adopted by the 2000 physi
cists, chemists, mathematicians and engineers
who developed the atomic bomb. They are
greatly worried about the possible conse
quonces of what they have done, and over 90
per cent of them have agreed that atomic weap
ons are much too dangerous for sovereign na
tions to play around with. Their statement ad
vises steps toward full international control.
The atomic scientists have a certain momen
tary influence in Washington and they desire
the immediate support of their position by
scholars in all fields. Over a hundred Stanford
professors signed up in a hurried and hap
hazard canvass last week and their names were
wired forward to Washington. The contest
there is not by any means over, and further
support is needed. All professors and instruc
tors who share the views of the atomic scien
tists, as published in the Daily last Friday,
should immediately sign the statement. Copies
are available in the offices of Professors George
Beadle, Philip Buck (go to room 28), George
Sensabaugh, and Paul Kirkpatrick. Nearly
everyone who has seen the statement has
wanted to sign it, so there must be a couple
of hundred more endorsements to be had for
the asking.
Very truly,
Paul Kirkpatrick

To the Editor:
The alleged purpose of the ballot which ap
peared on the front page of Friday's Daily was
to (jive a hearing to student opinion regarding
international' control of the atomic bomb. Ac
cording to the Daily, if a sufficient affirmative
vote was received, a petition was to be sent
to Mr. Truman, Mr. Byrnes, and Mr. McMahon
urging that the United States make public the
secrets of the bomb. This student heartily de
nounces, as no doubt do many others, the word
ing of that ballot.
The right of individual students or groups
of students to express their personal opinions
on matters of public importance and interest is
not to be questioned. Excom, however, is an
official group representing Stanford students
as a whole, and as such may be expected to
act in response to student opinion. By failing
to do so last Wednesday evening, Excom acted
in a way undemocratic and contrary to the pur
poses of student government.
Under the circumstances of Friday's ballot
ing, a vote, even by more than half the stu
dents on campus, would not show sufficient
support, to justify sending the proposed peti
tion. Failure of less than half the students to
vote v/ould indicate that possibly a petition
should be sent carrying opinions opposite those
proposed. Under the form of the ballot stu
dents are given no opportunity to express a
contrary idea. The ballot is of such form as we
v/ould expect to be customary if Stanford stu
dent government was considered authoritarian
and unresponsive to student opinion.
On so important a public issue as control of

the atomic bomb, an attempt on the part of
members of Excom to create, rather than to re
flect student opinion may be considered an
unfaithfulness to the trust imposed upon them
by their selection as student officers. This
student is of the belief that the intention to de
termine student opinion on this matter is a
natural consequence of the printing of a num
ber of interesting articles in the Daily; and he
considers it commendable.
Excom, however, acted in such a way as to
impose upon members of the student body
responsibility for an opinion which possibly
is not the student opinion. Whether or not
students favor giving to potentially hostile
national groups the hard - won technical data
needed to make the bomb can only be deter
mined by the use of an impartial and a free
ballot.
Very truly yours,
J. Olson
Editor's note. —Though Excom discussed the
advisability of having a "Yes, No" vote on the
ballot in Friday's Daily, it was felt that in the
light of present events the situation demanded
an affirmative vote by all A.S.S.U. members
who were in favor of "immediate support to
ward the establishment of a world federation,
above national sovereignty, that can effectively
and co-operatively control atomic energy." The
petition submitted bears the number of A.S.S.U.
members who, realizing the urgency of the sit
uation, recognized the need for immediate, di
rect action in what has been termed civiliza
tion's most crucial problem. The Daily sup
ported the ballot in form and material. Discus
sion, pro and con, of whether students favor
giving out technical data, as well as discussion
of other aspects of the atomic energy problem,
is always welcome.)
