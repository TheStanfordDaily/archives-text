There are two ways you can tell that Christ
mas is gradually, very gradually coming—by
Hinks' window and by scratched-out dates (25
days to go) on every true Stanford calendar.
Let's take Hinks' window first. That half ton
Santa Claus with a case of mechanical jitters
is enough to shake, if not even shatter, any
wholesome illusions of happy little men drift
ing down sootless, two-feet-wide chimneys on
Christmas Eve.
Even if we give the Hinks' red-boy the bene
fit of a ten-foot chimney, there's still the prob
lem of getting him back up, once he's down.
You can't imagine his "scampering" up the
chimney and back to Hansum and Pransum,
where he left them deshingling the roof. Not
only would the Hinks' prop be hindered by
his normal weight, but there v/ould be the
problem of scampering with numerous lead
ingots tucked away under his jacket. The in
gots were put there to keep the monster on
the ground during some of its more violent
periods of twitching.
Its head jerks back and forth at several-sec
ond intervals, while the body remains rigid,
hands squarely on sides of chair and feet flat
ly on ground. This contortion itself wouldn't
be so bad if it weren't for that face. Its eyes
and mouth are wide open and fit all too well
with the Rossott-red complexion.
There has been some controversy as to what
keeps that little window-full of Christmas joy
twitching. One guess is that an old washing
machine motor keeps it swishing back and
forth, or more logically, that the head is jerked
by slave labor.
Then there's the matter of sound. At "the
Spirit's" feet is placed a sign which reads:
"Sound by courtesy of the so-and-so electric
company." But apparently the so-and-so elec
tric company goes in for solidified sound.
Above the twitching head is suspended a quo
tation from the frozen mouth. It says some
thing about "He-he" and "Come in, boys and
girls" and "In Hinks' there are all kinds of
thinks."
But you don't go in; you creep away from
the twitching man, rejoicing that today there
is one day less than yesterday. Then when you
get back to the campus, these cussed Califor
nians try to cheer you by telling you that you'll
get to go caroling during finals and that in a
few more weeks, a potted palm with cotton
stuffed around the base will be placed in the
lobby.
So then you go upstairs and cross another
day off the calendar 25 more to go. You
spend the evening shading and reshading the
crossed off dates and draw frames around the
next date. Finally, your calendar is a mass of
color good enough for ornamenting any wall
hung from the molding on a long string, natch.
And that's Christmas cheer at Stanford.

next date. Finally, your calendar is a mass of
color good enough for ornamenting any wall
hung from the molding on a long string, natch.
And that's Christmas cheer at Stanford.
There are two ways you can tell that Christ
mas is gradually, very gradually coming—by
Hinks' window and by scratched-out dates (25
days to go) on every true Stanford calendar.
Let's take Hinks' window first. That half ton
Santa Claus with a case of mechanical jitters
is enough to shake, if not even shatter, any
wholesome illusions of happy little men drift
ing down sootless, two-feet-wide chimneys on
Christmas Eve.
Even if we give the Hinks' red-boy the bene
fit of a ten-foot chimney, there's still the prob
lem of getting him back up, once he's down.
You can't imagine his "scampering" up the
chimney and back to Hansum and Pransum,
where he left them deshingling the roof. Not
only would the Hinks' prop be hindered by
his normal weight, but there v/ould be the
problem of scampering with numerous lead
ingots tucked away under his jacket. The in
gots were put there to keep the monster on
the ground during some of its more violent
periods of twitching.
Its head jerks back and forth at several-sec
ond intervals, while the body remains rigid,
hands squarely on sides of chair and feet flat
ly on ground. This contortion itself wouldn't
be so bad if it weren't for that face. Its eyes
and mouth are wide open and fit all too well
with the Rossott-red complexion.
There has been some controversy as to what
keeps that little window-full of Christmas joy
twitching. One guess is that an old washing
machine motor keeps it swishing back and
forth, or more logically, that the head is jerked
by slave labor.
Then there's the matter of sound. At "the
Spirit's" feet is placed a sign which reads:
"Sound by courtesy of the so-and-so electric
company." But apparently the so-and-so elec
tric company goes in for solidified sound.
Above the twitching head is suspended a quo
tation from the frozen mouth. It says some
thing about "He-he" and "Come in, boys and
girls" and "In Hinks' there are all kinds of
thinks."
But you don't go in; you creep away from
the twitching man, rejoicing that today there
is one day less than yesterday. Then when you
get back to the campus, these cussed Califor
nians try to cheer you by telling you that you'll
get to go caroling during finals and that in a
few more weeks, a potted palm with cotton
stuffed around the base will be placed in the
lobby.
So then you go upstairs and cross another
day off the calendar 25 more to go. You
spend the evening shading and reshading the
crossed off dates and draw frames around the
next date. Finally, your calendar is a mass of
color good enough for ornamenting any wall
hung from the molding on a long string, natch.
