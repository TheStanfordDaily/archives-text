# Dutch Student Tells of Holland's Sabotage In Five Years of Resistance Against Nazis
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
Five years of sabotage—destroying
bridges, blowing up railroad tracks 1
and supply trains, liberating prison- |
crs from the dread concentration
camps, aiding persecuted peoples,
(.specially the Jews, and getting in
telligence information over the wire
lesses to England —is the story of
Holland's unfailing resistance to !
Naziism and all it stood for.
"Conscience of A Nation"
More specifically it is the story of i
ili • underground movement in Hoi- '
land led by Dutch students and mini
isters of the church—"the conscience j
of a nation" —told by Edmund Peter !
Wellenstein, Dutch student and lead- '

er in Holland's resistance movement.
Edmuud Wellenstein arrived in
this country four weeks ago after
being asked by the World Student
Service Fund to tour tiie United
States with two other European stu
dents to give information on the
needs, problems, and hopes of stu
dents in conquered and liberated
•Europe.
The People Stand
A student in the University of
Delft near The Hague, Wellenstein
became active in the resistance when
Germany invaded Holland. "It was
useless for the Dutch army to resist
the German columns," Wellenstein
said. "We only had thousands to
their millions."
"The only real resistance is civil—
not giving up, doing without means,
learning your special job by experi
ence, with tyo plans, no materials,
and with little outlook or hope for
the future. That is the difference
between the stand of an army and
the resistance of the people," he said.
Underground Acts
The actual underground was de
scribed by Wellentsein as a small
but exceedingly active organization
with students in the key positions.
"Though all the people could resist
Naziism mentally, only a small group
acting as the underground could
carry on active resistance," Wellen
;tein stated.
He added that the people looked
to the students for leadership and
help. "When I was in prison," he
said, "I used to talk to a barber in
the cell next to me through a hole
in the wall. One day he spoke of
committing suicide. I asked him
what he thought would happen to
Holland if everyone did the same?
'It is easy for you,' the barber said.
'You are a student who has the
strength to resist. You are expected
to lead. I am just an old man'."
"Dangerous to The State"
Edmund Wellenstein's first job in
the underground was the publishing
of an underground newspaper. He
soon became suspected by the Ger
mans, was put into a concentration
camp on five charges but with no
evidence, and was released within
eight months. Because he was con
sidered as "dangerous to the stale"
by the Naziis, he "disappeared" for
a short rest period, rejoined the un
derground, and worked in it until
Vlay, :«945.
During this time Wellenstein, with
the aid of a fellow member of the
underground, became a "furniture
dealer," setting up headquatrers in a
storehouse in The Hague. "We had
no cars so we carried our 'goods' by
bicycles and horses," he explained.

Seven agents, each serving a specific, ]
assigned pari of the country, report- (
ed to the "furniture store" every ;
vveek.
"Swiss Road" Is Escape I 1
If anyone had to escape he got out '
of the country by means of "the j I
Swiss Road." "This was a series of |
larms," Wellenstein pointed out.
"with a day's walking distance be- I '
tween each." The cooperation of I
agents in other countries for food, j
shelter, and aid was needed, but no i
help could come through from I
Switzerland, lie said.
In describing the attitude of the ;
German conquerors when they first
entered Holland, Wellenstein said
that the Nazi soldiers were very
friendly. The German soldiers had
been taught that they were liberat
ing the countries that they were
conquering, that those countries j
were enslaved and would be glad to j
j return to the "homeland."
Friendship Policy
For the first three months the
Dutch carried out a "friendship pol
icy" until the Germans saw it
wouldn't work. Norway and the \
Netherlands, mainly because of the !
Nordic characteristics of the people,
became a big disappointment to the
Germans when they refused to co
operate with the "fatherland" ac
! cording vo Wellenstein.
"It was then that Seiss Inquart, ;
who betrayed Austria, was sent to [
Holland as civil governor," Wellcn- |
stein slated. The Germans began an <
attack upon the free institutions — i
the universities and the churches—
first, "because they were the centers ;
of democracy, human ideals, learn
in-;, and free thought." he added.
Students Read
When the Jewish professors were
forbidden to teach, the students re
acted with the first general demon
stration. As a result, professors and
students were imprisoned. Equip
ment and supplies were confiscated j
from the universities. The Germans
took away radio sets, cars, and bi- j
cycles and imposed the penalty of ,
4\2 years in a concentration camp I
for listening to other than German j
broadcasts.
Wellenstein pointed out that re- i
leased criminals were used as guards
in the concentration camps. The
I weakest and most inefficient Dutch
i who were won over to the German j
side were trained by special Burgur- j
j .neister courses.
Dutch Pull Strike
The first large major strike by the
whole population was made in 1943
when the Nazis issued (he edict that
all Dutch men between the ages of j

18 and 35 were to be deported to
Germany as slave labor unless they
signed an act of loyalty to Germany.
"We struck, too, because we had
heard through the underground that
Stalingrad had not fallen. The peo
ple didn't hope to gain anything;
they just loosened their feeling of
tc nsion for five days," Wellenstein
explained. "No one worked. The
farmers didn't even milk their cows,
and the Germans shot them on the
farms."
"When the Gestapo came by the
houses anil there weren't any young
men standing before the houses, they
went in and searched. But they
didn't find any men in the houses,"
Wellenstein added.
Eight Months—Liberation
In 1E44, eight months before the
war ended in May, the Dutch began
their last strike which they thought
would only last a month. By that
time they expected liberation. The
Germans, in the meantime, took all
food supplies out of the. country.
Living on one month's rations, the
Dutch carried on active resistance
for eight months until liberated in
May.
"After liberation we received text
books, paper, note books, and food
supplies through the World Student
Service Fund. The WSSF asked us
to send representatives to a confer
ence in France to meet with students
from the other United Nations,"
Wellenstein said.
World Students Unite
"We had never heard of the World
Student Service Fund in Holland
before, but at that conference we
learned the need for students all
over the world to unite. Countries
are not cooperating together now,"
Wellenstein stated. "The only hope

for international cooperation lies
with the students all over the
world."
Although students in all countries
contribute to the World Student
Service Fund pool, the United States
is one of the largest contributors,
having given millions of dollars to
the WSSF during the past years.
'"The students in Europe and es
pecially in Ilnlkmd are deeply grate
ful to the work of students in the
United States in giving to that fund,"
Wellenstein said. He believed that
Stanford contributed around $1,300
to the WSSF this year through the
War Fund Drive.
WSSF to The 'tescue
Wallenstein also pointed out that
WSSF funds were helping to send
tubercular Dutch students to the
great international tuberculosis san
atorium at Leysin in Switzerland in
addition to enabling Dutch students
to go to England and Denmark for
three-month recovery periods.
Wellenstein added, "We now have
a chance to meet and sec other stu
dents from other countries, to learn
to cooperate together for a united
world."

supplies through the World Student
Service Fund. The WSSF asked us
to send representatives to a confer
ence in France to meet with students
from the other United Nations,"
Wellenstein said.
World Students Unite
"We had never heard of the World
Student Service Fund in Holland
before, but at that conference we
learned the need for students all
over the world to unite. Countries
are not cooperating together now,"
Wellenstein stated. "The only hope

for international cooperation lies
with the students all over the
world."
Although students in all countries
contribute to the World Student
Service Fund pool, the United States
is one of the largest contributors,
having given millions of dollars to
the WSSF during the past years.
'"The students in Europe and es
pecially in Ilnlkmd are deeply grate
ful to the work of students in the
United States in giving to that fund,"
Wellenstein said. He believed that
Stanford contributed around $1,300
to the WSSF this year through the
War Fund Drive.
WSSF to The 'tescue
Wallenstein also pointed out that
WSSF funds were helping to send
tubercular Dutch students to the
great international tuberculosis san
atorium at Leysin in Switzerland in
addition to enabling Dutch students
to go to England and Denmark for
three-month recovery periods.
Wellenstein added, "We now have
a chance to meet and sec other stu
dents from other countries, to learn
to cooperate together for a united
world."
Five years of sabotage—destroying
bridges, blowing up railroad tracks 1
and supply trains, liberating prison- |
crs from the dread concentration
camps, aiding persecuted peoples,
(.specially the Jews, and getting in
telligence information over the wire
lesses to England —is the story of
Holland's unfailing resistance to !
Naziism and all it stood for.
"Conscience of A Nation"
More specifically it is the story of i
ili • underground movement in Hoi- '
land led by Dutch students and mini
isters of the church—"the conscience j
of a nation" —told by Edmund Peter !
Wellenstein, Dutch student and lead- '

er in Holland's resistance movement.
Edmuud Wellenstein arrived in
this country four weeks ago after
being asked by the World Student
Service Fund to tour tiie United
States with two other European stu
dents to give information on the
needs, problems, and hopes of stu
dents in conquered and liberated
•Europe.
The People Stand
A student in the University of
Delft near The Hague, Wellenstein
became active in the resistance when
Germany invaded Holland. "It was
useless for the Dutch army to resist
the German columns," Wellenstein
said. "We only had thousands to
their millions."
"The only real resistance is civil—
not giving up, doing without means,
learning your special job by experi
ence, with tyo plans, no materials,
and with little outlook or hope for
the future. That is the difference
between the stand of an army and
the resistance of the people," he said.
Underground Acts
The actual underground was de
scribed by Wellentsein as a small
but exceedingly active organization
with students in the key positions.
"Though all the people could resist
Naziism mentally, only a small group
acting as the underground could
carry on active resistance," Wellen
;tein stated.
He added that the people looked
to the students for leadership and
help. "When I was in prison," he
said, "I used to talk to a barber in
the cell next to me through a hole
in the wall. One day he spoke of
committing suicide. I asked him
what he thought would happen to
Holland if everyone did the same?
'It is easy for you,' the barber said.
'You are a student who has the
strength to resist. You are expected
to lead. I am just an old man'."
"Dangerous to The State"
Edmund Wellenstein's first job in
the underground was the publishing
of an underground newspaper. He
soon became suspected by the Ger
mans, was put into a concentration
camp on five charges but with no
evidence, and was released within
eight months. Because he was con
sidered as "dangerous to the stale"
by the Naziis, he "disappeared" for
a short rest period, rejoined the un
derground, and worked in it until
Vlay, :«945.
During this time Wellenstein, with
the aid of a fellow member of the
underground, became a "furniture
dealer," setting up headquatrers in a
storehouse in The Hague. "We had
no cars so we carried our 'goods' by
bicycles and horses," he explained.

Seven agents, each serving a specific, ]
assigned pari of the country, report- (
ed to the "furniture store" every ;
vveek.
"Swiss Road" Is Escape I 1
If anyone had to escape he got out '
of the country by means of "the j I
Swiss Road." "This was a series of |
larms," Wellenstein pointed out.
"with a day's walking distance be- I '
tween each." The cooperation of I
agents in other countries for food, j
shelter, and aid was needed, but no i
help could come through from I
Switzerland, lie said.
In describing the attitude of the ;
German conquerors when they first
entered Holland, Wellenstein said
that the Nazi soldiers were very
friendly. The German soldiers had
been taught that they were liberat
ing the countries that they were
conquering, that those countries j
were enslaved and would be glad to j
j return to the "homeland."
Friendship Policy
For the first three months the
Dutch carried out a "friendship pol
icy" until the Germans saw it
wouldn't work. Norway and the \
Netherlands, mainly because of the !
Nordic characteristics of the people,
became a big disappointment to the
Germans when they refused to co
operate with the "fatherland" ac
! cording vo Wellenstein.
"It was then that Seiss Inquart, ;
who betrayed Austria, was sent to [
Holland as civil governor," Wellcn- |
stein slated. The Germans began an <
attack upon the free institutions — i
the universities and the churches—
first, "because they were the centers ;
of democracy, human ideals, learn
in-;, and free thought." he added.
Students Read
When the Jewish professors were
forbidden to teach, the students re
acted with the first general demon
stration. As a result, professors and
students were imprisoned. Equip
ment and supplies were confiscated j
from the universities. The Germans
took away radio sets, cars, and bi- j
cycles and imposed the penalty of ,
4\2 years in a concentration camp I
for listening to other than German j
broadcasts.
Wellenstein pointed out that re- i
leased criminals were used as guards
in the concentration camps. The
I weakest and most inefficient Dutch
i who were won over to the German j
side were trained by special Burgur- j
j .neister courses.
Dutch Pull Strike
The first large major strike by the
whole population was made in 1943
when the Nazis issued (he edict that
all Dutch men between the ages of j

18 and 35 were to be deported to
Germany as slave labor unless they
signed an act of loyalty to Germany.
"We struck, too, because we had
heard through the underground that
Stalingrad had not fallen. The peo
ple didn't hope to gain anything;
they just loosened their feeling of
tc nsion for five days," Wellenstein
explained. "No one worked. The
farmers didn't even milk their cows,
and the Germans shot them on the
farms."
"When the Gestapo came by the
houses anil there weren't any young
men standing before the houses, they
went in and searched. But they
didn't find any men in the houses,"
Wellenstein added.
Eight Months—Liberation
In 1E44, eight months before the
war ended in May, the Dutch began
their last strike which they thought
would only last a month. By that
time they expected liberation. The
Germans, in the meantime, took all
food supplies out of the. country.
Living on one month's rations, the
Dutch carried on active resistance
for eight months until liberated in
May.
"After liberation we received text
books, paper, note books, and food
supplies through the World Student
Service Fund. The WSSF asked us
to send representatives to a confer

j .neister courses.
Dutch Pull Strike
The first large major strike by the
whole population was made in 1943
when the Nazis issued (he edict that
all Dutch men between the ages of j

18 and 35 were to be deported to
Germany as slave labor unless they
signed an act of loyalty to Germany.
"We struck, too, because we had
heard through the underground that
Stalingrad had not fallen. The peo
ple didn't hope to gain anything;
they just loosened their feeling of
tc nsion for five days," Wellenstein
explained. "No one worked. The
farmers didn't even milk their cows,
and the Germans shot them on the
farms."
"When the Gestapo came by the
houses anil there weren't any young
men standing before the houses, they
went in and searched. But they
didn't find any men in the houses,"
Wellenstein added.
Eight Months—Liberation
In 1E44, eight months before the
war ended in May, the Dutch began
their last strike which they thought
would only last a month. By that
time they expected liberation. The
Germans, in the meantime, took all
food supplies out of the. country.
Living on one month's rations, the
Dutch carried on active resistance
for eight months until liberated in
May.
"After liberation we received text
books, paper, note books, and food
supplies through the World Student
Service Fund. The WSSF asked us
to send representatives to a confer
ence in France to meet with students
from the other United Nations,"
Wellenstein said.
World Students Unite
"We had never heard of the World
Student Service Fund in Holland
before, but at that conference we
learned the need for students all
over the world to unite. Countries
are not cooperating together now,"
Wellenstein stated. "The only hope

for international cooperation lies
with the students all over the
world."
Although students in all countries
contribute to the World Student
Service Fund pool, the United States
is one of the largest contributors,
having given millions of dollars to
the WSSF during the past years.
'"The students in Europe and es
pecially in Ilnlkmd are deeply grate
ful to the work of students in the
United States in giving to that fund,"
Wellenstein said. He believed that
Stanford contributed around $1,300
to the WSSF this year through the
War Fund Drive.
WSSF to The 'tescue
Wallenstein also pointed out that
WSSF funds were helping to send
tubercular Dutch students to the
great international tuberculosis san
atorium at Leysin in Switzerland in
addition to enabling Dutch students
to go to England and Denmark for
three-month recovery periods.
Wellenstein added, "We now have
a chance to meet and sec other stu
dents from other countries, to learn
to cooperate together for a united
world."
Five years of sabotage—destroying
bridges, blowing up railroad tracks 1
and supply trains, liberating prison- |
crs from the dread concentration
camps, aiding persecuted peoples,
(.specially the Jews, and getting in
telligence information over the wire
lesses to England —is the story of
Holland's unfailing resistance to !
Naziism and all it stood for.
"Conscience of A Nation"
More specifically it is the story of i
ili • underground movement in Hoi- '
land led by Dutch students and mini
isters of the church—"the conscience j
of a nation" —told by Edmund Peter !
Wellenstein, Dutch student and lead- '

er in Holland's resistance movement.
Edmuud Wellenstein arrived in
this country four weeks ago after
being asked by the World Student
Service Fund to tour tiie United
States with two other European stu
dents to give information on the
needs, problems, and hopes of stu
dents in conquered and liberated
•Europe.
The People Stand
A student in the University of
Delft near The Hague, Wellenstein
became active in the resistance when
Germany invaded Holland. "It was
useless for the Dutch army to resist
the German columns," Wellenstein
said. "We only had thousands to
their millions."
"The only real resistance is civil—
not giving up, doing without means,
learning your special job by experi
ence, with tyo plans, no materials,
and with little outlook or hope for
the future. That is the difference
between the stand of an army and
the resistance of the people," he said.
Underground Acts
The actual underground was de
scribed by Wellentsein as a small
but exceedingly active organization
with students in the key positions.
"Though all the people could resist
Naziism mentally, only a small group
acting as the underground could
carry on active resistance," Wellen
;tein stated.
He added that the people looked
to the students for leadership and
help. "When I was in prison," he
said, "I used to talk to a barber in
the cell next to me through a hole
in the wall. One day he spoke of
committing suicide. I asked him
what he thought would happen to
Holland if everyone did the same?
'It is easy for you,' the barber said.
'You are a student who has the
strength to resist. You are expected
to lead. I am just an old man'."
"Dangerous to The State"
Edmund Wellenstein's first job in
the underground was the publishing
of an underground newspaper. He
soon became suspected by the Ger
mans, was put into a concentration
camp on five charges but with no
evidence, and was released within
eight months. Because he was con
sidered as "dangerous to the stale"
by the Naziis, he "disappeared" for
a short rest period, rejoined the un
derground, and worked in it until
Vlay, :«945.
During this time Wellenstein, with
the aid of a fellow member of the
underground, became a "furniture
dealer," setting up headquatrers in a
storehouse in The Hague. "We had
no cars so we carried our 'goods' by
bicycles and horses," he explained.

Seven agents, each serving a specific, ]
assigned pari of the country, report- (
ed to the "furniture store" every ;
vveek.
"Swiss Road" Is Escape I 1
If anyone had to escape he got out '
of the country by means of "the j I
Swiss Road." "This was a series of |
larms," Wellenstein pointed out.
"with a day's walking distance be- I '
tween each." The cooperation of I
agents in other countries for food, j
shelter, and aid was needed, but no i
help could come through from I
Switzerland, lie said.
In describing the attitude of the ;
German conquerors when they first
entered Holland, Wellenstein said
that the Nazi soldiers were very
friendly. The German soldiers had
been taught that they were liberat
ing the countries that they were
conquering, that those countries j
were enslaved and would be glad to j
j return to the "homeland."
Friendship Policy
For the first three months the
Dutch carried out a "friendship pol
icy" until the Germans saw it
wouldn't work. Norway and the \
Netherlands, mainly because of the !
Nordic characteristics of the people,
became a big disappointment to the
Germans when they refused to co
operate with the "fatherland" ac
! cording vo Wellenstein.
"It was then that Seiss Inquart, ;
who betrayed Austria, was sent to [
Holland as civil governor," Wellcn- |
stein slated. The Germans began an <
attack upon the free institutions — i
the universities and the churches—
first, "because they were the centers ;
of democracy, human ideals, learn
in-;, and free thought." he added.
Students Read
When the Jewish professors were
forbidden to teach, the students re
acted with the first general demon
stration. As a result, professors and
students were imprisoned. Equip
ment and supplies were confiscated j
from the universities. The Germans
took away radio sets, cars, and bi- j
cycles and imposed the penalty of ,
4\2 years in a concentration camp I
for listening to other than German j
broadcasts.
Wellenstein pointed out that re- i
leased criminals were used as guards
in the concentration camps. The
I weakest and most inefficient Dutch
i who were won over to the German j
side were trained by special Burgur- j
j .neister courses.

j return to the "homeland."
Friendship Policy
For the first three months the
Dutch carried out a "friendship pol
icy" until the Germans saw it
wouldn't work. Norway and the \
Netherlands, mainly because of the !
Nordic characteristics of the people,
became a big disappointment to the
Germans when they refused to co
operate with the "fatherland" ac
! cording vo Wellenstein.
"It was then that Seiss Inquart, ;
who betrayed Austria, was sent to [
Holland as civil governor," Wellcn- |
stein slated. The Germans began an <
attack upon the free institutions — i
the universities and the churches—
first, "because they were the centers ;
of democracy, human ideals, learn
in-;, and free thought." he added.
Students Read
When the Jewish professors were
forbidden to teach, the students re
acted with the first general demon
stration. As a result, professors and
students were imprisoned. Equip
ment and supplies were confiscated j
from the universities. The Germans
took away radio sets, cars, and bi- j
cycles and imposed the penalty of ,
4\2 years in a concentration camp I
for listening to other than German j
broadcasts.
Wellenstein pointed out that re- i
leased criminals were used as guards
in the concentration camps. The
I weakest and most inefficient Dutch
i who were won over to the German j
side were trained by special Burgur- j
j .neister courses.
Dutch Pull Strike
The first large major strike by the
whole population was made in 1943
when the Nazis issued (he edict that
all Dutch men between the ages of j

18 and 35 were to be deported to
Germany as slave labor unless they
signed an act of loyalty to Germany.
"We struck, too, because we had
heard through the underground that
Stalingrad had not fallen. The peo
ple didn't hope to gain anything;
they just loosened their feeling of
tc nsion for five days," Wellenstein
explained. "No one worked. The
farmers didn't even milk their cows,
and the Germans shot them on the
farms."
"When the Gestapo came by the
houses anil there weren't any young
men standing before the houses, they
went in and searched. But they
didn't find any men in the houses,"
Wellenstein added.
Eight Months—Liberation
In 1E44, eight months before the
war ended in May, the Dutch began
their last strike which they thought
would only last a month. By that
time they expected liberation. The
Germans, in the meantime, took all
food supplies out of the. country.
Living on one month's rations, the
Dutch carried on active resistance
for eight months until liberated in
May.
"After liberation we received text
books, paper, note books, and food
supplies through the World Student
Service Fund. The WSSF asked us
to send representatives to a confer
ence in France to meet with students
from the other United Nations,"
Wellenstein said.
World Students Unite
"We had never heard of the World
Student Service Fund in Holland
before, but at that conference we
learned the need for students all
over the world to unite. Countries
are not cooperating together now,"
Wellenstein stated. "The only hope

for international cooperation lies
with the students all over the
world."
Although students in all countries
contribute to the World Student
Service Fund pool, the United States
is one of the largest contributors,
having given millions of dollars to
the WSSF during the past years.
'"The students in Europe and es
pecially in Ilnlkmd are deeply grate
ful to the work of students in the
United States in giving to that fund,"
Wellenstein said. He believed that
Stanford contributed around $1,300
to the WSSF this year through the
War Fund Drive.
WSSF to The 'tescue
Wallenstein also pointed out that
WSSF funds were helping to send
tubercular Dutch students to the
great international tuberculosis san
atorium at Leysin in Switzerland in
addition to enabling Dutch students
to go to England and Denmark for
three-month recovery periods.
Wellenstein added, "We now have
a chance to meet and sec other stu
dents from other countries, to learn
to cooperate together for a united
world."
Five years of sabotage—destroying
bridges, blowing up railroad tracks 1
and supply trains, liberating prison- |
crs from the dread concentration
camps, aiding persecuted peoples,
(.specially the Jews, and getting in
telligence information over the wire
lesses to England —is the story of
Holland's unfailing resistance to !
Naziism and all it stood for.
"Conscience of A Nation"
More specifically it is the story of i
ili • underground movement in Hoi- '
land led by Dutch students and mini
isters of the church—"the conscience j
of a nation" —told by Edmund Peter !
Wellenstein, Dutch student and lead- '

er in Holland's resistance movement.
Edmuud Wellenstein arrived in
this country four weeks ago after
being asked by the World Student
Service Fund to tour tiie United
States with two other European stu
dents to give information on the
needs, problems, and hopes of stu
dents in conquered and liberated
•Europe.
The People Stand
A student in the University of
Delft near The Hague, Wellenstein
became active in the resistance when
Germany invaded Holland. "It was
useless for the Dutch army to resist
the German columns," Wellenstein
said. "We only had thousands to
their millions."
"The only real resistance is civil—
not giving up, doing without means,
learning your special job by experi
ence, with tyo plans, no materials,
and with little outlook or hope for
the future. That is the difference
between the stand of an army and
the resistance of the people," he said.
Underground Acts
The actual underground was de
scribed by Wellentsein as a small
but exceedingly active organization
with students in the key positions.
"Though all the people could resist
Naziism mentally, only a small group
acting as the underground could
carry on active resistance," Wellen
;tein stated.
He added that the people looked
to the students for leadership and
help. "When I was in prison," he
said, "I used to talk to a barber in
the cell next to me through a hole
in the wall. One day he spoke of
committing suicide. I asked him
what he thought would happen to
Holland if everyone did the same?
'It is easy for you,' the barber said.
'You are a student who has the
strength to resist. You are expected
to lead. I am just an old man'."
"Dangerous to The State"
Edmund Wellenstein's first job in
the underground was the publishing
of an underground newspaper. He
soon became suspected by the Ger
mans, was put into a concentration
camp on five charges but with no
evidence, and was released within
eight months. Because he was con
sidered as "dangerous to the stale"
by the Naziis, he "disappeared" for
a short rest period, rejoined the un
derground, and worked in it until
Vlay, :«945.
During this time Wellenstein, with
the aid of a fellow member of the
underground, became a "furniture
dealer," setting up headquatrers in a
storehouse in The Hague. "We had
no cars so we carried our 'goods' by
bicycles and horses," he explained.

Seven agents, each serving a specific, ]
assigned pari of the country, report- (
ed to the "furniture store" every ;
vveek.
"Swiss Road" Is Escape I 1
If anyone had to escape he got out '
of the country by means of "the j I
Swiss Road." "This was a series of |
larms," Wellenstein pointed out.
"with a day's walking distance be- I '
tween each." The cooperation of I
agents in other countries for food, j
shelter, and aid was needed, but no i
help could come through from I
Switzerland, lie said.
In describing the attitude of the ;
German conquerors when they first
entered Holland, Wellenstein said
that the Nazi soldiers were very
friendly. The German soldiers had
been taught that they were liberat
ing the countries that they were
conquering, that those countries j
were enslaved and would be glad to j
j return to the "homeland."
Friendship Policy
For the first three months the
Dutch carried out a "friendship pol

Netherlands, mainly because of the !
Nordic characteristics of the people,

Germans when they refused to co
