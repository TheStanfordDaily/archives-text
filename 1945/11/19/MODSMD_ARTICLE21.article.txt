Musical Notes
Would you like to hear records by
Bebe Daniels, the Duncan Sisters, A 1
Jolson, Harry Richman, Ben Bernie,
and other old-time performers? Last
week Hage's Music Co. in Palo Alto
received a shipment of 3,000 records
15 to 30 years old. Strangely enough,
most of the records have never been
played, and therefore they have
brand-new surfaces. There might
even be some Whiteman sides and
Bix if you hurry. We found some....
Yesterday Artie Shaw scrapped
the band that he assembled after his
release from the Navy. When asked
why he "disbanded," he only said
that he was going "to take it easy."
Recently married to Ava Gardener,
Shaw has retired before only to re
turn shortly to batan-wielding. . . .
Something New
Roy Eldridge, ace trumpet star re
cently with Mr. Shaw, will present
his new unit to the public some time
in the middle of December.
Shortly after the first of the year
Corky Corcoran, young Harry James
tenor star, will leave the Horn's crew
to go out with a band of his own.
The venture will have James' bless
ing and financial support. . . . Wes
ley Prince, former bassist with the
King Cole Trio, is attempting to re
join the group under the G.I. Bill
of Rights.
Miscellaneous Music
Bobby Sherwood has cut five sides
for Capitol Records. Included in the
session were "Cottontail," two origi
nal jump tunes, and two popular
ballads. These will be the first Sher
wood sides released in over a year.
. . . Jo Stafford is screen-testing for
Metro. . . . Applause is in order for
the tunes featured in the Gaieties.
Many of them have possibilities for
nation-wide publication.
Duke Disappoints
Always of note to music lovers is
a Duke Ellington platter, and more
ear-opening is a disappointing one
because the Duke so seldom records
anything that is not the utmost in
"jazznocracy." Last week our ears
were opened by the newest Ellington
release, "Come To Baby, Do" and
"Tell You What I'm Going To Do."
The first side is all Lawrence
Brown and Joya Sherill. With
Brown's bombastic sliphorn opening
the record, Joya proceeds to do a
very nice vocal on a very average
tune. Rex Stewart's comet is very
obvious in support, as Miss Sherrill
once again demonstrates that she is
on her way to the vocal top.
Brown-Sherrill Combo
The reverse is another showcase
for the Brown-Sherill combination,
as Brown, who is almost never below
his high standard, and the hip-phras
ing Joya struggles through the tune
wl ieh must be one of the year's
worst. There is really nothing to say
concerning the performance as the
artists were too overly-handicapped
by the song.
It seems a shame the Victor Re
cording Co. cannot get with it and
cut and release some of the won
derful Ellington compositions and
numbers, such as "The Black, Brown,
and Beige Suite," which the Duke's
men do so well. Artists such as these
men are wasting their talents play
ing such tripe as the aforementioned
tunes.
Goodman Good Man
It looks like Benny Goodman
Week as Columbia released two
more sides by the "King of Swing"
after last week's wonderful "I Got
Rhythm." Not living up to the stand
ard set by sextet's performance are
the full band's renditions of "Sym
phony" and "My Guy's Come Back."
"My Guy's Come Back," the belter
of the two, is a tune written by Ray
McKinl"y and Mel Powell when the
two were overseas directing the
Glenn Miller army band. Liza Mor
row, whose style and voice are very
similar to Ella Mae Morse, is fea
tured on the vocal, and except for
the label on the record you would
think that you were listening to the
"Cow Cow Boogie" lady instead of
Miss Morrow.
Only Average Solo
The solo by Benny is great clari
net, of course, but it is only average
Goodman. The section work is very
precise, and it is one of the best
sides that the Goodman full orches
tra has cut in a great while.
On the other side is "Symphony"
which is certainly not what its title
claims. The only solo of note is the
one by Goodman, and the chirping
is once again by Liza Morrow, who
â– minds more lik" herself on ibis one
