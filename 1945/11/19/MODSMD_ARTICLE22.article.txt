ment with well
-1 sustained sus
pense, it shows
Jennifer Jones
and Joseph Col
to their best ad
vantage.
The story has
th e improbable
- dream-like or
nightmarish, as
you like—qual-

ity of "Rebecca," combined with the
tangled plot of "Mildred Pierce." Ii
avoids too great a contrast with
reality by centering the action in
England, particularly in the moors
of Essex, where an audience natu
rally assumes almost anything can
| happen.
j Cotton Writes Letters
As the story opens, Joseph Cotton
! has been writing love letters to
"Victoria Remington" for an army
pal, who already shows a slightly
"caddish" streak. It is plain that
"Victoria" has fallen in love with
the man who she thinks wrote the
letters,'" and Cotton has pangs of
conscience.
While recuperating from wounds
in a front hospital (he seems to rc-
I cover unscai red) he receives word
j that his friend Moreland has mar-
I ried Victoria.
Is Psychological Study
After this introduction, the story
moves into a psychological study of
Vicloria, who develops complete
amnesia while standing trial for her
husband's murder. At times, Jenni
fer Jones seems just too sweet and
honest for even a movie, but any
thing can happen on the moors.
Together, Cotton and Jones work
out a very satisfactory solution to
the situation, combining a happy
ending with a certain amount of
logic. Once in the spirit of the

movie, however, the audicnco didn't
secin to mind minor inconsistencies
of character and plot.
See l(< From Beginning
"Love Letters" is decidedly one of
those movies that must Le seen
from the beginning to get the sus
pense and plot build-up. Those who
like to throw themselves into mov
ies and stay under the influence for
a couple of hours will love "Love
Letters."
"Boston Blackie's Rendezvous"
also has murder, a psychological
case, and a happy ending, but, un
fortunately, it also carries Chester
Morris. For an ordinary "Lone Ran
ger" type of fantasy, it was fine, un
less, of course, you've seen so many
"Boston Blackie" double bills that
you already know the formula.
This time, Blackie is mistaken for
"The Strangler," and begins a hair
raising chase to prove his inno-<
cence. Naturally, law and order tri
umph. Well, at least "The Stran
gler" adds a new "twist."—Ayres
