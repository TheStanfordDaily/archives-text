## SIDELINE SLANTS 
### Art Levinson 
Saturday marked the day many people had been waiting
for for three long years. Stanford playing a football game. To
many people the big Stanford Stadium had been vacated en
tirely too long. That is past history, and this is no time to expa
tiate on that point. The main thing is that Stanford has resumed
football. Many skeptics and wiseacres had been saying all
aiong that Stanford would never resume football. That this
school would follow the action of the University of Chicago.
As Bill Corbus, Stanford grid great of a dozen years back, said,
"Stanford had good reason for dropping intercollegiate football."
Stanford lost its first game. Taking all considerations into
mind, this defeat should come as no great surprise to anyone.
Naturally, the entire Farm populace wanted a gridiron victory.
The players—playing their hearts out —tried as much as pos
sible to bring victory to Stanford. But in the last analysis, inex
perience brought us to defeat. In less than twenty hours' prac
tice, which is an awfully short time to bring a football squad
into shape for a grid encounter, Marchie Schwartz tried his hard
est to give the squad the necessary fundamentals to play a foot
ball game. In such a short space of time certain things had to
be sacrificed for others.
One thing that was neglected was pass defense, which
showed up terrifically in the game. Stockton simply out-passed
Stanford. That the situation was not entirely hopeless, however,
might be evidenced by the fact that a couple of Stockton passes
were intercepted. A little more practice on this phase of de
fense, and we ought to be able to cope with anything that the
Merchant Marine Academy of San Mateo might throw at us on
Dec. 1, the date for our next, and last, tussle of the abbreviated
season.
No complaints can be thrown at the line for the way they
played. They made possible a good running attack, and stopped
cold any thoughts that Bob Krieger, Stockton quarterback, had
of calling many running plays for his outfit. The lineman who
stood out in this writer's mind was Harry Davison, who fought
ferociously all afternoon, and was in a goodly portion of all
plays. No players should be slighted for their play. They
played to the best of their ability, and that is all that can be
expected. With a little experience behind them, the team will
go places. Other schools in the conference beware! Stanford
will be r'arin' to go next fall.
Biggest gridiron upset of the Pacific Coast took place in the
big Coliseum in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon, when the
underdog Uclans dumped St. Mary's for their first defeat of the
season, and probably removed all possibilities of the Moragan
lads traveling south to New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl con
test on the first day of the new year. When St. Mary's got by
U.S.C. by a big margin, everybody expected them to finish their
season in fine order without any defeats to blemish their marks,
but U.C.L.A. spoiled that ambition. Every team has its bad game,
even if they win, and when St. Mary's just got by Fresno State
on Armistice Day, "those in the know" said that their bad game
was over, and that the Bruins would be swamped. But Bert La
Brucherie's gang pulled a fast one, the sideline slanters.
With their defeat by St. Mary's, U.C.L.A. looms as a strong
contender for the Rose Bowl game. They have suffered a defeat
only at the hands of U.S.C., and in their return encounter they
might whip them in good order. This would please this depart
ment no end. Our motto is "Stop U.S.C. at any cost." If U.S.C.
goes to the Rose Bowl this year, they will surpass the consecu
tive record now held by both schools at three games apiece.
They would also go out in front as having played more times
in the Pasadena festivity. As long as Stanford can't be in there
fighting, any team will be welcome except the Jeff Cravath
coached Trojans.

ball game. In such a short space of time certain things had to
be sacrificed for others.
One thing that was neglected was pass defense, which
showed up terrifically in the game. Stockton simply out-passed
Stanford. That the situation was not entirely hopeless, however,
might be evidenced by the fact that a couple of Stockton passes
were intercepted. A little more practice on this phase of de
fense, and we ought to be able to cope with anything that the
Merchant Marine Academy of San Mateo might throw at us on
Dec. 1, the date for our next, and last, tussle of the abbreviated
season.
No complaints can be thrown at the line for the way they
played. They made possible a good running attack, and stopped
cold any thoughts that Bob Krieger, Stockton quarterback, had
of calling many running plays for his outfit. The lineman who
stood out in this writer's mind was Harry Davison, who fought
ferociously all afternoon, and was in a goodly portion of all
plays. No players should be slighted for their play. They
played to the best of their ability, and that is all that can be
expected. With a little experience behind them, the team will
go places. Other schools in the conference beware! Stanford
will be r'arin' to go next fall.
Biggest gridiron upset of the Pacific Coast took place in the
big Coliseum in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon, when the
underdog Uclans dumped St. Mary's for their first defeat of the
season, and probably removed all possibilities of the Moragan
lads traveling south to New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl con
test on the first day of the new year. When St. Mary's got by
U.S.C. by a big margin, everybody expected them to finish their
season in fine order without any defeats to blemish their marks,
but U.C.L.A. spoiled that ambition. Every team has its bad game,
even if they win, and when St. Mary's just got by Fresno State
on Armistice Day, "those in the know" said that their bad game
was over, and that the Bruins would be swamped. But Bert La
Brucherie's gang pulled a fast one, the sideline slanters.
With their defeat by St. Mary's, U.C.L.A. looms as a strong
contender for the Rose Bowl game. They have suffered a defeat
only at the hands of U.S.C., and in their return encounter they
might whip them in good order. This would please this depart
ment no end. Our motto is "Stop U.S.C. at any cost." If U.S.C.
goes to the Rose Bowl this year, they will surpass the consecu
tive record now held by both schools at three games apiece.
They would also go out in front as having played more times
in the Pasadena festivity. As long as Stanford can't be in there
fighting, any team will be welcome except the Jeff Cravath
coached Trojans.
Saturday marked the day many people had been waiting
for for three long years. Stanford playing a football game. To
many people the big Stanford Stadium had been vacated en
tirely too long. That is past history, and this is no time to expa
tiate on that point. The main thing is that Stanford has resumed
football. Many skeptics and wiseacres had been saying all
aiong that Stanford would never resume football. That this
school would follow the action of the University of Chicago.
As Bill Corbus, Stanford grid great of a dozen years back, said,
"Stanford had good reason for dropping intercollegiate football."
Stanford lost its first game. Taking all considerations into
mind, this defeat should come as no great surprise to anyone.
Naturally, the entire Farm populace wanted a gridiron victory.
The players—playing their hearts out —tried as much as pos
sible to bring victory to Stanford. But in the last analysis, inex
perience brought us to defeat. In less than twenty hours' prac
tice, which is an awfully short time to bring a football squad
into shape for a grid encounter, Marchie Schwartz tried his hard
est to give the squad the necessary fundamentals to play a foot
ball game. In such a short space of time certain things had to
be sacrificed for others.
