# Stanford Footballers Bow in Gridiron Debut
## 
### JIM WELTER 
Stanford's first post-war grid ma
chine returned to gridiron competi-
I tion—backwards —last Saturday aft -
I ernoon ;is they absorbed a 19-13 de-
I feat at the hands of the Stockton
Commandos. Non-paying spectators
numbering around 10,000 watched
the Indians take a 13-7 halftime lead
only to fall victim to a Commando
two-touchdown second half.
An advantage in experience which
showed itself in forward passing en
abled the Stockton team to down the
spirited but green Indians. Coach
Marchie Schwartz's starting lineup
wasn't graced by a single college
experienced player.
Stockton Passed
The Cardinal eleven lost the game
because Bob Krieger, ex-Dartmouth
All-American fullback and later
Philadelphia Eagles Pro, heaved
eleven passes that netted 171 yards
and all three touchdowns. End
Frank Lynch was on the receiving
end of eight of Krieger's comple
tions. Only six of his aerials failed
to hit their mark, three of these be
ing Stanford interceptions.
Stanford received the opening
kiekoff with Willey making a
I twenty-yard return to the thirty-
I live. After three plays that placed
j the ball on the Stanford forty-four
! with fourth down comnig up, Quar
i terback Burks defied all play-calling
[ traditions by electing to try for the
I first down. It was successful, too, as
he personally picked up the neces
j sary yardage on a quarterback sneak.
A few plays later with the ball
I now resting on the twenty-nine,
! Burks took to the air, first to Mar
j tin for a five-yard gain and then a
! twenty-four-yard toss to Left End
I Dave DeSwarte who needed to step
only three yards for the touchdown.
Gene Martin attempted to convert
for the extra point, but the kick was
I blocked.
It didn't take long, however, until
| the Commandos had struck back.
| With Krieger filling the ozone with
i his accurate passes, the Indians were

promptly trailing 7-6, the payoff be
ing a twenty-seven-yard snag on the
j part of Lynch. Kreiger booted the
extra point. In fact, he did all of the
Stockton kicking, kickoffs and punts.
Not until midway in the second
| stanza did the Stanfords push ahead
again. Krieger's attempted quick
kick was partially blocked and Stan
; lord took over on the Stockton forty
one. A series of running plays moved
j the Big Red to the twenty-three
; from where Burks passed to Martin
j .in the right flat, the latter ramming
over for the T.D. Varner split the
j uprights for the thirteenth point.
Stanford Stopped
This concluded the Indians' scor
ing, but in the fourth quarter Krieg
er connected for two more six-point
! passes for the Commandos, one to
Lynch and the other to Wojnolowics.
I Following each of these scores, the
Cardinals roared back with determi
nation, each time only to be stopped
I on the Commando iwenty.
Stockton garnered eleven first
j downs, of which seven were the re
| suit of passing. The Cardinals picked
up 173 yards in rushing—good for
! nine first downs. Their six com
j pleted passes netted them only forty
nine yards as compared to the sol
diers' 171.
Some nifty ball players were un
covered and in particular was Gene
Martin the hardest running halfback
of the afternoon. Martin, whose run
; ning theory seemed to be "go through
! a man rather than around him,"
j picked up almost half of the Stanford
i yardage. The other halfback, Don
Lipelt, also demonstrated that he can
move the ball forward. Fullback
Fred Willey ably shoved his 200-
pound frame through the Commando
line on numerous occasions. Curt
Burks handled the ball-handing po
| sition of the T deftly and did some
| good passing, the only trouble being
that he was too stingy with his
| tossses. Linemen that caught the
spectator's eye were the two guards,
j Lee Dyer and Jim Fry, and Tackle
{ Harry Davison.
All in all, Coach Schwartz was

well pleased with the team's show
ing, considering the age and experi
ence that the Commandos packed.
The latter outfit also had the added
advantage of having played eight
games this fall. Tlv Big Red's com
ing scrap with the San Mateo
Merchant Marine cadets will go a
long way in showing just how well
they can correct their faults.
