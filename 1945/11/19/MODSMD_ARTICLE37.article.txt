## 
### 
TOKYO, Nov. 18 (UP). â€” Gcji.
Douglas Mac Arthur, blocking re
vival of Japanese air power through
non-military channels, today or
dered abolished all Japanese "pilot
or other training related to aircraft
design, construction, maintenance or
operation."
A directive issued by Allied head
quarters outlawed possession by
Japanese private organizations or
commercial firms of any aircraft or
air training facilities.
Supreme Allied Headquarters, in
a move to bring the reality of free
speech to as many Japanese as pos
sible, ordered the Japanese govern
ment to submit by Dec. 1 a plan to
replace approximately 4,000,000 ra
dio receivers which have been worn
out in Japan since 1942.
The air urder encompasses such
organizations as the Japanese Air
ways Co., Ltd., whose capital valu
ation is 117,000,000 yen or $7,800,000
at the present official exchange rate;
the Japan Aviation Association,
founded in 1940, subsidized by the
government, for "sport flying" and
pilot training, and two government
research institutes.
