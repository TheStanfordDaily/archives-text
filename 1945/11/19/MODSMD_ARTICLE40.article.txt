BATAVIA, Java, Nov. 19 (UP).â€”
British troops seized control of Se
marang today after Indonesian Na
tionalists, planning to launch a gen
eral uprising in central Java, mur
dered two British officers. In Ba
tavia 13 Dutch native troops were
wounded in new outbursts of fight
ing.
British Indian troops inched ahead
against stiff opposition on the ninth
day of the battle of Soerabaja. It
was announced that in the week
ending last midnight, 17 Indian en
listed men and one British officer
were killed in Soerabaja and 95
were wounded.
Premier Sutan Sjahrir of the self
proclaimed Indonesian republic and
his new cabinet held an emergency
meeting. It followed a conference
with Dutch and British officials Sat
urday night which failed to find a
solution to the Java trouble, caused
by Indonesian demands for complete
independence.
The outbreaks in Semarang, mid
way between Batavia and Soera
baja, came after an Indonesian ra
dio station on Saturday had broad
cast that: "Tomorrow we shall start
and either kill the British or drive
them from Java."
At the same time an extremist
plot to attack British forces at dawn
was discovered when an Indonesian
policeman handed a Japanese sentry
a pamphlet urging the Japanese to
join the attack, the Aneta news
agency reported. The British com
mander, Brig. Bethell, ordered Brit
ish troops to take over control of
Semarang immediately.
