# Kamaainas Reorganize Among Farm Islanders
## 
### BOB PECK 
Mahalo! Pehea oe? Mai kai nui?
Get it? We're going native on you.
We've joined the Hawaiian Club at
Stanford to get a little more of that
Honi kau a wiki wild. Check that!
Over here the mainlanders say,
"Kiss me quick."
Reorganizing for the first time
since 15)40, the Hui O Alii (there we
go again, just natives at heart!) is
getting together all Stanford stu
dents who live in the Hawaiian Is
lands.
Chain Club
The club, which is a member of a
chain of Bay Area clubs, has been
inactive during the war and met
Tuesday to formulate plans for ac
tivities throughout the year. The
mother club of the group is the
Hui O Hawaii, or The Chief's Club.
Other active clubs are found at San
Jose State and University of Cali
fornia.
Purposes of the club, besides rais
ing Hui O Welakahao, arc (1) to
promote and maintain a spirit of
congeniality among students from
Hawaii; (2) to ally the kindred in
terests of its members at Stanford;
and (3) to foster friendly relations
between Hawaii and the U.S. main
land.
"Spirit of Aloha"
Wednesday night two Kamaainas
(oldtimers) presented a plan for re
organization to Excom. Don Hell
bush and Slosson "Pake" Jong dis
cussed plans for future parties and
events with the A.S.S.U.
According to the organizers of the
movements, this is strictly no hoo
malimali—it's the real McCoy. The
Islanders want to present their
"Spirit of Aloha" to Stanford. The
"Spirit of Aloha" embodies the feel
ing of all Hawaii—a spirit rarely
found among American groups in
far-off territories.
Future Activities
The club is planning big activities
during the next three quarters. Al
ready planned is a big all-campus
function during spring quarter. All
who remember the South Sea Sway
given at Monroe in 1943 testify to
the potentialities of the Island
group.
At the Monroe dance Martha Aus

tin, Pi Phi from the islands, stopped
j the crowd with her hula. Leis were
much in evidence at the South Sea
I Sway. An old Hawaiian custom that
I is always observed goes with the
presentation of a flower lei. Upon
putting the lei around the young
I lady's neck, the fellow seals the
! ceremony with a fond embrace.
Island Customs
Other island customs that Hiu O
Alii plan to bring to Stanford are
the shoeless dancing parties and
the beach song-fests.
Under present standards, the club
says it will be impossible to serve
the old-time favorite, Planters'
| Punch (rum, fruit juice, and Co.),
j at their dances but they hope to find
I other Hawaiian dishes for the cam
pus to try.
Kamaainas Joke
Standing joke among club mem
bers is the taking out of citizen
ship papers. "The Stanford Kamaa
inas will endeavor throughout the
coming quarter to 'naturalize' Stan
ford mainland malahines," Charlie
Clark said. "Most of the students at
Stanford haven't been back home
for four years and we're all anxious
to get together and talk over Island
news," Jackie Cannon added.
Flections Tomorrow
At the meeting Tuesday, the Ka
maainas discussed plans for reor
ganizing the club and the re-elec
tion of officers. It was decided that
at next Tuesday's meeting, at 7:30
in the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse, the election would be
held. Get-togethers with other Is
land groups such as the ones at San
Jose State, Mills, Oregon U, and
California are planned for the im
mediate future.
There are 42 Kamaainas on cam
i pus now and all are urged to at
! tend tomorrow's meeting, Charlie
Clark said. About 18 attended the
j meeting Tuesday.
After the business was dispensed

with Tuesday the Islanders raised a
little Hui O' Welakahao. Mickey
Bowers brought his ukulele and an
Island song-fest was held.
