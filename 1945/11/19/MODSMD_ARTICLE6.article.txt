Daily will publish a series of ar
! tides dealing with the return of
fraternities to the campus. This
will be the first of a scries of
three.)
In all likelihood fraternities will
come back to Stanford next fall.
They will face a number of prob
lems, and the administration, fra
ternities, and alumni are working
together toward their solution.
Discussions with Interfralernity
Board faculty members Harold
Maile Bacon, associate professor of
mathematics and adviser to Theta
Delta Chi. and Elmer D. Fagan, pro
fessor of economics, reveal that the
I problems fall into five main groups:
I. Physical
11. Financial
111. Membership
IV. Conduct
V. Scholarship
Physical and operational prob
j lems are the most numerous.
During the wartime absence of
fraternities the University rented
their houses. A release will have
I to be negotiated as no definite date
| was set in the renting agreement.
Summer Return?
Financial Vice-President Frank F.
Walker hopes that the houses can
j be returned at the beginning of next
summer, to give fraternities an op
portunity to prepare them for open
ing in the fall. However, no house
will be able to open until all are
available. Some of them, such as the
Sigma Chi house, are now occupied
by women students. Their return
' will mean additional lowering of
: women's facilities.
Tine University has contracted to
['return the houses in the same con

dition as it received them. It is not
easy to ascertain the original condi
tions. Agreements will have to be
worked out for each house.
Financial and membership prob-
I lems arc directly related to the
physical.
1 Physical Changes
The administration has announced
; its intention of requiring fraterni
! ties to make certain changes—fire
j escapes and improved kitchen con
| ditions, for instance—to conform to
j health and safety standards. These
i standards have not yet been deter
mined in detail, but it is clear that
1 the required changes will constitute
a very serious financial strain for
some of the fraternities. Where will
they get the money?
Will there be enough members to
make operation economically feas
ible? Dr. Tresidder has indicated
that he is opposed to having only
one or two houses open. He would
like to sec at least a majority 'of j
| them open at the same time. This
will necessitate determining all stu- t
dent «Members of fraternities who I
| were here before the war and who
| wish to return.
Full Occupancy
A house will need about 25 board- J
ers to operate an efficient table,
i Furthermore, the University will re
! quire full occupancy of every house, j
Some fraternities may have to share
their houses with non-members.
Three of them tried this early in the !
| war and it worked out quite well.
New pledging and rushing regu- j
lations will have to be formulated !
jto enable a small fraternity with j
j only one or two members to obtain j
| pledges. To what extent will alumni
I be permitted to aici?
Conduct problems are contained '
j in the Administration's interest in j
I "better organized guidance and svi- j
| pervision." Recognizing this, the I

I Postwar Planning Committee of the
; Interfraternity Board of Control has
recently recommended "balanced
social activities consistent with good
morals and good taste; in conformity
with the standards of the Associated
j Students of Stanford University."
The University has recommended
house mothers as a step toward
'guidance and supervision." The
fraternities have not taken kindly to
{his idea.
Scholarship Not Serious
Scholarship is perhaps the least
serious and least pressing problem,
j Little can be done about it until the
fraternities are in operation. The
latest available official figures, for
the year 1942-43, show that the
scholarship of students who belong
to Greek-letter societies compares
favorably with non-members. The
former had a grade-point average of
2.47, the latter averaged 2.46.
These are some of the problems.
I What is being done to solve them?
The most important group work
! ing on them is the Interfraternity
j Board, empowered to supervise, en
i act, and enforce "all legislative, ex
i ecu live, and disciplinary matters in
connection with fraternities, sub
i ject only to the approval of the Uni
versity President."
The Board consists of six students,
j who make up a majority, two fac
ulty mehibers appointed for two
-1 year terms by the President of the
j University, two alumni elected by
| the Interfraternity Alumni Confer
j ence, and the Dean of Students who
j is an ex-oflicio voting member.
The board has been working in
co-operation with the administra
j tion, alumni representatives, and
fraternity officials. Their common
| desire to smooth the way for ihe
I return of the "frats" will help them
to iron out the difficulties.
