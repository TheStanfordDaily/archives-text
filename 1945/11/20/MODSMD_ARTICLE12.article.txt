# China Must Teach Asia States Noted Educator

### 
China's new role is to build up a ,
modern model democratic stale in ;
Asia, according to Dr. "Jimmie" 1
Yen, American-educated member of j
China's People's Political Council
and educator of more than GO mil- j
lion Chinese, who spoke last night
in Cubberley Hall.
"China must be a teacher and j
leader of the people of Asia," Dr.
Yen said. "The foundation has been :
laid." Dr. Yen began his work by
teaching the Chinese labor troops in
France to read and write during the
first World War. There he rediscov
ered his own people -their need for
education and their tremendous po- j
icntialities.
Returning to China after the war. |
he developed a basic Chinese system
of 1300 characters which takes 9(j \
hours to learn and costs only 12
cents per person. Since 1930, 47 mil
lion people have been taught to read
and write by the government, which !
adopted Dr. Yen's system. Dr. Yen '
predicts that illiteracy can be wiped |
out within the next ten years.
Dr. Yen and a stafT of educators
who helped him, worked out the
system in an experimental county
or hsien. "We had to live with the
people and get to know them and |
their problems before we could
teach them," he said. "Thoy were ;
faced with illiteracy or mental stag
nation, poverty, disease, and mis- i
government."
The first step in the program was |
to establish demonstration schools. I
The { :eople became stimulated and j
began to want to remake and im- ;

prove their country. People's schools
were established by the people
themselves, modeled on Dr. Yen's
plan.
Next, agricultural production was
improved, but the peasants were still
poor businessmen. So market co
operatives were set up to improve
economic conditions in the villages.
By this system, China's national in
come could be increased three bil
lion, five million dollars, Dr. Yen
ont inued.
"Bu|. material reconstruction
without social reconstruction would
be a disaster," he stressed. "Labor
would be exploited and China would
become a gigantic sweatshop." Ed
ucation of the people prevented this.
Modern scientific methods of com
bating disease were then adopted.
Health workers were organized
throughout the experimental county
and health stations were set up.
With increased stimulation as a
result of education and better liv
ing conditions, the people began to
want a better government. A rep
resentative assembly was adopted in
the county.
The four-point experiment was
eventually adopted throughout Chi
na and carried on by the people
themselves with the aid of the na
tional government. It helped im
mensely in defense organization
during ihe war.
"The war has been a teacher and
liberator to China," Dr. Yen said.
"A new people has been born which
wants freedom at any price—they
would perish for it."—Nancy Ban
