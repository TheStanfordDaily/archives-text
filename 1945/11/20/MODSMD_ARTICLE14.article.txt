Subjects discussed a! Women's
Conference yesterday were:

Report.
:i. Scholarship Cup.
4. Late leaves.
. r ). Vocom.
The suggestions of a benefit ac
tivity to be sponsored by Confer
ence and put on by the women siu
dents as a whole to raise money for
some contribution to the University
was brought up by President Patty
Patten. The idea was referred lo
house meetings last night, and a re
port will be made next week.
Riding Stables
Miss Patten suggested giving a
Conference scholarship once a year,
opening the riding stables for stu
dent use and gym class use, or do
nating money to help in building a
new Student Union building.
Beatty O'Hair, vice-chairman, sug
gested that the money could be
laised by giving a large benefit tea
with bridge tables and a fashion
show. Other suggestions were to re
vive the tradition of a County Fair
in Union Court which was held win
ter quarter before the war. Conces
sions were set up, and there was
food, dancing, and a fashion show.
The idea of having a barbecue and
dance at the boathouse during spring
quarter or at the end of winter
quarter was also brought up.
Late Openings Vetoed
Because of the difficulty in the
administration of the living groups,

the University feels that it will be ,
impossible to have the living groups
open from 12 to 1:30 on Friday and !
Saturday nights. Supervision from an !
older person would be necessary, j
and this would mean additional pay
and inconvenience. Also, girls who |
were trying to sleep or study would
be disturbed.
Since Conference recognizes the
need of having some place to go after
12, its members discussed the pos
sibility of fixing up the Nitery and
opening it under supervision. Girls
were asked in their house meetings
last night whether or not they would
use the Nitery, and if they would
be willing to supervise the Nitery
and clean it up one night each quar
ter, if it is impossible to hire any
one for this job.
Nitery Opening?
About four girls would be needed
each Friday and Saturday night,
Miss Patten said, and each house j
would be responsible one night each !
quarter. Provisions for a nickelo
dion, food, and firewood would have
to be made. Miss o''Hair will dis
cuss the matter with Cardinals to
night, and the issue will be brought
up next week.
It is almost impossible to buy a

suitable scholarship cup to award to
a women's living group at the end 1
of each, quarter, but Conference
will start its scholarship activities
regardless. Some award will be
made until the cup can be bought.
2 a.m. Leaves Improving
Sylvia Davis, chairman of Women'a
Council, stressed that late leaves
will be non-quota tomorrow night,
but that Sunday night, will be a reg
ular quota late leave night. She
reported a big improvement in the
use of 2 a.m. late leaves.
"Women in the Future" will be the
topic of the First Vocom program, the
date of which has not been set.
"Channels for Jobs" will also be
discussed. Other lectures will in
clude possibilities for Art and Dra
ma, Physical Sciences, Business, and
Social Work majors.
