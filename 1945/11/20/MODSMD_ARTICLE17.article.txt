# Science Group To Hear Talk On Narcotics
## 
### 
William D. McElroy, research as
sociate in the Biological Sciences
Department, and a National Re
search Council Fellow at Stanford
University this quarter, will speak
on "Effect of Narcotics on Enzyme
Systems" at the weekly Biological
Sciences Department's seminar to
morrow at 4:15 in room 4110 of Jor
dan Hall.
He will speak on the mechanics of
action of narcotics in the cell with
special reference to enzyme .systems.
Emphasis will be placed on distin
guishing between theories of nar
cosis developed in the past and on
pointing out that all these theories
can be resolved to the same thing.
The enzyme system used to apply
the new theory is one involving
emission of light in micro-organ
isms, bioluminescence.
The seminar will be preceded by
a tea at 4 p.m. Students, faculty, and
visitors are invited to attend.
