## BACKGROUND FOR SUCCESS 
### 
The obvious success of one of Stanford's
biggest weekends since 1942 is a fair indica
tion of whal can be accomplished by well
organized, interested groups of students who
are.;'! afraid of the hard work and time in
volvrJ in slaging a rally, a student production,
or a dance.
Wr saw during the war years 100 many stu
denl ' loaders," "BWOCS or BMOCS," or what
ever ;!,• y may be called getting by on "reputa
tion"; , nd fit the same time we saw other leaders
in campus activities working madly to drum
up lagging student interest and support just
because that undefinable "Stanford Spirit/
seemed to be lacking.
Certainly no one can question the fact that
that ".spirit" is here again; it is our contention
that it was always here, though tuned to a
mot sober note during the war, from which i 4
emerged, perhaps, in a new, more mature
fori::. At any rate our thanks today go to all
tho r ?: people who have worked long and hard
and usually without recognition to maintain
and rebuild (he foundations of good taste, de
cn: , and serious thought balanced by en
thusiasm and fun—foundations upon which the
postwar Stanford is now being built.
