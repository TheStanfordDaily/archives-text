STUDENT ELECTION APATHY

To the Editor:
After contemplating on the results of the
A.S.S.U. election, one appalling fact became
apparent to me: out of a student body of 3,423
students- 1,820 women and 1,603 menâ€”only a
little more than 500, or approximately one out
of seven, voted for the B.A.C. representative;
and out of 1,604 men only 230, or approximately
one cut of seven, exercised their right to vote.
1 h'-'ve a strong faith in the Stanford spirit, and
I do not believe that this poor showing in the
voting was primarily due to student apathy.
I do believe, however, that our present elec
tion system does not provide an adequate
means of introducing the prospective candi
dates. No American citizen is anxious to ex
ercise his precious right of voting if he does
not know who the candidate is, or what he
stands for. The freshmen had a slightly better
chance to meet their candidates for office than
the "tudent Isody had to meet its B.A.C. candi
dates or the Stanford men had to meet their
Men's Council candidates. In the case of the
latter two groups, the only means that they had
of knowing the candidates were by personal
acquaintance, which is very limited, or by read
ing their names in the Daily on the Tuesday and
Wednesday prior to the election.
I would suggest that the Election Board af
ford the campus some way of meeting and
knowing its candidates, either by extended
publicity, a statement of the candidate's policies
or a review of his qualifications for the office;
or by some political rally. If neither of these
two suggestions fills the bill, then perhaps
Excom has some ideas on the subject - it's a
serious problem.
Sincerely yours,
Charles H. Clark
