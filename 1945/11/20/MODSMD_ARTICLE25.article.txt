### STANLEY WILSON 
First of the week congratulations go to Murylou
Putton and her gang, Coach Marehie Schwartz and
his team, and the naval contingent on campus.
Reasons in the order of the above mentioned: For
a bang-up and well-organized production of the Gaie
ties; for a great start back to football; and lor the
manner in which the Navy has entered into our campus
life. The sailors, who arrived only a matter of weeks
ago, are now present in just about every activity on
campus, as evidenced by their active participation in
the Gaieties and on the field Saturday. A definite asset
to us all.

Criticism of the week goes to whoever is responsible
for neglecting to supply needed emergency equipment
at football games. When a Stockton Commando player
was seriously injured in the game Saturday, and un
able to walk off the field under his own power, there
wasn't a stretcher on the field to be found. We hated
to .see a man in such condition carried ulf the field like
so much barley.

We are more than happy to hear of the proposed
plan for more student housing—for both single and
married students. The next thing we'd like to see is
a statement of Administrative policy regarding the
ratio of students, and to what degree Stanford is ex
pected lo expand,
No definite word has come out, to our knowledge,
stating the ratio of men to women, and the total en
rollment in the future. It is obvious that the Uni
versity had to admit a good many more women stu
dents during the lean war years than was the prac
tice in peacetime. But is this practice to continue, or
are men with professional ambitions and returning
veterans going to receive priority? Many of us rc
m< mber 1940 when there were approximately 4500
students here; we remember that it also was just
about tli saturation point—both as regards housing
and classroom facilities.
There are many of us here, plus a multitude of the
alumni, who would be reluctant to acquiesce to a stu
dent body over the 1940 mark. Stanford prides itself
on being a small, compact, private school. Much of the
personality, forcefulness, prestige and small school ad
vantages would be lost by such a venture. We'd hate
to see Stanford turned into an assembly line as is
present at several West Coast colleges at (his writing.
We want to keep our individuality.
All this brings me hack to the original point of
establishing a ratio from which to work. If the total
is set at 5,000 students, for example, the ratio would
follow almost automatically. As it is at present, there
is little evidence of a planned total—or ratio. It
appears that anyone with the money and a possibility
of finding a place to live is being accepted with little
consideration of what we are going to do with the
student when he arrives. Are we biting off more
than we can chew? I hope the Administration will
not forget this over (he Thanksgiving recess.
