### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Jacquos on the streets of Paris is saying, "Politics
now is like it was before the war." So are Pierre and
Francois, for that matter. They are not too far wrong.
The shifting coalitions and unstable governments
that characterized the old Chamber of Deputies, "the
broken mirror that was supposed to reflect France,"
as the French called it, are coming back into the pic
ture in the new Constituent Assembly.
MAKEUP
The last election split the major blocs of seats be
tween the conservative MRP's, Leon Blum's Socialists,
and the Communists. The Communists drew th» most
seats, but not the majority. The sentiments of the
MRP delegates put them squarely against the Com
munists, and so the middle was held down by Leon
Blum's boys.
It looked for a while as though General De Gaulle
could succeed in muzzling the Communists with an
MRP-Socialist coalition, but then the fireworks began.
The business of (he Constituent Assembly was to
draft a new constitution. The Communists started
oil" by demanding that highly socialistic provisions
be written in. The MRP. partly through sentiment
and partly through a desire for a loan from capital
istic America, stood in opposition.
The Socialists, however, were not too sure where
they stood. Nationalization of industry was something
that they wanted, and the party that was supposed to
lead them in a coalition against the too-violent Com
munists was against it; A large bloc of Socialists,
therefore, changed sides.
C ABINET EIGHT
So, either through a cleverly thought-out plan, or
by simply standing by its platform, the Communist
party had shattered the .steel ring that De Gaulle was
trying to tighten around them. With ibis fact staring
them in the face, they made their next move, a demand
for more cabinet representation.
In Europe, each cabinet post controls something.
De Gaulle was willing to give his unwelcome partners
some run of the nebulous concepts called "the social
and economic posts," but the Communists wanted to
direct some body that had guns.
COMMUNIST DEMANDS
So th? Communists asked for either the Lebel army
lifles under command of the War Ministry, the Police
Positives that the Home Ministry directed, or a chance
at fietting Russian Degayatrevs through the Foreign
Ministry. Some Socialists, who were not so sure about
where La Belle France was going under the right, were
not so sure that they shouldn't have them.
Needless to say. De Gaulle and company were not
very happy about the Communists demanding their
"rights." So the general decided to play his last card,
an appeal to the people. He did it by resigning.
The Communists wore a liltle undiplomatic in their
glee over this turn of events. They instantly held a
caucus and nominated a Socialist president in the
hope of getting the support of that body. The MRP's,
ol course, are weoping quite profusely about the per
secution of France's new symbol of leadership.
So De Gaulle's future comes up for a vote today.
The MRP's will probably be for, and the Communists
against. The Socialists are split, and, despit? overtures
from both sides, united on a solid front sitting this
dance out.
Since the Communists hold more seats than the
MRP's, Do Gaulle might lose this vole. But the ques
tion comes, what then?
I LECTION?
Who will follow De Gaulle? There might be an
election. Even if it is extra-legal, De Gaulle, as thiol
of the General Staff, has the bayonets to enforce it.
With it coming up, De Gaulle could easily arrange to
U< I himself renominated over his undoubtedly reluc
lant protests. But then, overshadowing the election
question itself, what would happen to the vielor?
If it is the Communists, France's conservative ele
ments. the army, Ihe property owners, and the fann
ers, might become frightened. There would be dan
ger of revolution. If it the (he De Gaullists, then
(lie Communists might try 1«» exploit their popularity
among the industrial proletariat by forcing their will
through a general strike. Either way, the trouble for
France is iusf bei'iniiiui'
