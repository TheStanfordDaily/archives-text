# Farm Students Receive Tuition, Fees from Gifts
## 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
Over 120 students are now at
tending Stanford with scholarships
covering their tuition and fees, an
nounced Mrs. Olivia B. Byler, schol
arship secretary. And in spite of
the large number awarded there are
not enough to go around.
"Even this year, with the enroll
ment below that of normal times
and with the number of ex-service
men under the G.I. Bill of Rights
and thus not eligible, we didn't have
enough lo meet the demand," added
Mrs. Byler. "For the 351 applicants
only 89 full scholarships were at the
disposal of the committee for the
current year."
104 Scholarships
At present 104 scholarships are on
the list in the bulletin and 15 new
ones have been added during the
course of the past year. Scholarships
come either from the income of the
endowments or from annual gifts.
The largest scholarship fund was
established in 1932 under the will
of Henry Newell, a mining man from
Utah, whose gift totaled $230,000.
Approximately 15 men and women
hold these awards, which are valued
at between $430 and $750 each.
The fund, with an annual income
of about $9,000, has a regional quali
fication in that it is to benefit stu
dents from Utah who desire to at
tend Stanford.
Gamble Fund Large
Another large fund was started
for native-born undergraduate men
in 1934 when George E. Gamble gave
the University $17,000, to which he
has since added until the gift now
has reached approximately $125,000.
Mr. Gamble, who is now living in
Palo Alto, graduated from Stanford
in the class of 1905. He has always
been interested in helping students
and with the aid of his scholarships
about 12 men each year recsive $000,
providing they maintain at least a
"B" average.
First Scholarship
The first scholarship award was
made by the University in 1900 un
der a fund set up by Mrs. Stanford
as a memorial for her son, Leland,
Jr. In those days there was no tui
tion, so the fund of about $480 was
to be used "to pay the living ex
penses, cost of books, fees, and other
necessary expenses of the holder."
Following this in 15)14 the next be
quest of $10,000 was left by W. J.
Dickey "to aid young men from
Fresno County, preferably from
Fresno City, to make their way
through Stanford University."
Scholarship funds are usually es
tablished by bequests or gifts, such
as the Newell and Gamble awards,
or by persons in memory of some
relative or close friend or by vari
ous alumni clubs or organizations,
such as the Stanford Club of Chi
cago or the American Legion.
Vanderburgh Scholarship
For example, the Stanley Wilson
Vanderburgh Memorial Scholarship
was founded by his parents in honor

of their son, who was killed while
riding home from the golf course on
a motorcycle. He had attended
Stanford from 1938 to 1941.
Vanderburgh's picture, along with
several others in whose memory
the funds have been established, is
hanging in the Scholarship office in
the Administration Building.
Another memorial was begun a
year ago by George Bliss Culver,
emeritus Dean of Men, and his wife
in honor of their son, who was killed
in the war.
Some Carry Restrictions
Some scholarships carry restric
tions, although the majority are un
restricted. The Royall Victor Schol
arship is fpr persons who have re
sided at some time in Connecticut,
and the Leonard Daniels Ellis Fund
is for persons from San Diego.
Oftentimes, the donor will stipu
late the branch of study for the re
cipient, as for instance, the Mabel
Hyde Cory Scholarship in history
or the Florence Hecht Fries Fund in
medicine or the John M. liaffner
award :'n law.
"B" Average Required
When a scholarship does not
amount to $429, which will cover
tuition and fees, several small award
tuition and lees, several small

awards will be made to the same
person in order that the total may
be reached. For most scholarships
a minimum "B" average is required.
Awards are available for the three
j general classifications: entering un
j dergraduates, matriculated under-
I graduates, and graduates. The basis
: for choosing the recipients is gen
erally scholastic excellence and fi
-1• ii
nancial need.

arships before Feb. 15 and the out
come is announced April 1. For ma
j triculated undergraduates the dead
! line is April 15, with results out by
the end of May. Entering students
must have their applications in by
Mayl, and announcements are made
| early in June.
Scholarship Committee
Most of the scholarships are han
dled by a special scholarship com
mittee, although some are nominated
by a particular department or group
as the fund may deisgnate.
The members of the committee
are James B. Wells, professor of civil
i engineering; Bernard F. Haley, pro
i fessor of economics; Raymond D.
Harriman, professor of classics;
! George S. Parks, professor of chem
i istry; Dean Mary Yost; and Dean

Scholarship Committee
Most of the scholarships are han
dled by a special scholarship com
mittee, although some are nominated
by a particular department or group
as the fund may deisgnate.
The members of the committee
are James B. Wells, professor of civil
i engineering; Bernard F. Haley, pro
i fessor of economics; Raymond D.
Harriman, professor of classics;
! George S. Parks, professor of chem
i istry; Dean Mary Yost; and Dean
[ John M. Stalnaker.
Over 120 students are now at
tending Stanford with scholarships
covering their tuition and fees, an
nounced Mrs. Olivia B. Byler, schol
arship secretary. And in spite of
the large number awarded there are
not enough to go around.
"Even this year, with the enroll
ment below that of normal times
and with the number of ex-service
men under the G.I. Bill of Rights
and thus not eligible, we didn't have
enough lo meet the demand," added
Mrs. Byler. "For the 351 applicants
only 89 full scholarships were at the
disposal of the committee for the
current year."
104 Scholarships
At present 104 scholarships are on
the list in the bulletin and 15 new
ones have been added during the
course of the past year. Scholarships
come either from the income of the
endowments or from annual gifts.
The largest scholarship fund was
established in 1932 under the will
of Henry Newell, a mining man from
Utah, whose gift totaled $230,000.
Approximately 15 men and women
hold these awards, which are valued
at between $430 and $750 each.
The fund, with an annual income
of about $9,000, has a regional quali
fication in that it is to benefit stu
dents from Utah who desire to at
tend Stanford.
Gamble Fund Large
Another large fund was started
for native-born undergraduate men
in 1934 when George E. Gamble gave
the University $17,000, to which he
has since added until the gift now
has reached approximately $125,000.
Mr. Gamble, who is now living in
Palo Alto, graduated from Stanford
in the class of 1905. He has always
been interested in helping students
and with the aid of his scholarships
about 12 men each year recsive $000,
providing they maintain at least a
"B" average.
First Scholarship
The first scholarship award was
made by the University in 1900 un
der a fund set up by Mrs. Stanford
as a memorial for her son, Leland,
Jr. In those days there was no tui
tion, so the fund of about $480 was
to be used "to pay the living ex
penses, cost of books, fees, and other
necessary expenses of the holder."
Following this in 15)14 the next be
quest of $10,000 was left by W. J.
Dickey "to aid young men from
Fresno County, preferably from
Fresno City, to make their way
through Stanford University."
Scholarship funds are usually es
tablished by bequests or gifts, such
as the Newell and Gamble awards,
or by persons in memory of some
relative or close friend or by vari
ous alumni clubs or organizations,
such as the Stanford Club of Chi
cago or the American Legion.
Vanderburgh Scholarship
For example, the Stanley Wilson
Vanderburgh Memorial Scholarship
was founded by his parents in honor

of their son, who was killed while
riding home from the golf course on
a motorcycle. He had attended
Stanford from 1938 to 1941.
Vanderburgh's picture, along with
several others in whose memory
the funds have been established, is
hanging in the Scholarship office in
the Administration Building.
Another memorial was begun a
year ago by George Bliss Culver,
emeritus Dean of Men, and his wife
in honor of their son, who was killed
in the war.
Some Carry Restrictions
Some scholarships carry restric
tions, although the majority are un
restricted. The Royall Victor Schol
arship is fpr persons who have re
sided at some time in Connecticut,
and the Leonard Daniels Ellis Fund
is for persons from San Diego.
Oftentimes, the donor will stipu
late the branch of study for the re
cipient, as for instance, the Mabel
Hyde Cory Scholarship in history
or the Florence Hecht Fries Fund in
medicine or the John M. liaffner
award :'n law.
"B" Average Required
When a scholarship does not
amount to $429, which will cover
tuition and fees, several small award
tuition and lees, several small

awards will be made to the same
person in order that the total may
be reached. For most scholarships
a minimum "B" average is required.
Awards are available for the three
j general classifications: entering un

I graduates, and graduates. The basis
: for choosing the recipients is gen
erally scholastic excellence and fi

Scholarship Committee
Most of the scholarships are han
dled by a special scholarship com
mittee, although some are nominated
by a particular department or group
as the fund may deisgnate.
The members of the committee
are James B. Wells, professor of civil
i engineering; Bernard F. Haley, pro
i fessor of economics; Raymond D.
Harriman, professor of classics;
! George S. Parks, professor of chem
i istry; Dean Mary Yost; and Dean
[ John M. Stalnaker.
Over 120 students are now at
tending Stanford with scholarships
covering their tuition and fees, an
nounced Mrs. Olivia B. Byler, schol
arship secretary. And in spite of
the large number awarded there are
not enough to go around.
"Even this year, with the enroll
ment below that of normal times
and with the number of ex-service
men under the G.I. Bill of Rights
and thus not eligible, we didn't have
enough lo meet the demand," added
Mrs. Byler. "For the 351 applicants
only 89 full scholarships were at the
disposal of the committee for the
current year."
104 Scholarships
At present 104 scholarships are on
the list in the bulletin and 15 new
ones have been added during the
course of the past year. Scholarships
come either from the income of the
endowments or from annual gifts.
The largest scholarship fund was
established in 1932 under the will
of Henry Newell, a mining man from
Utah, whose gift totaled $230,000.
Approximately 15 men and women
hold these awards, which are valued
at between $430 and $750 each.
The fund, with an annual income
of about $9,000, has a regional quali
fication in that it is to benefit stu
dents from Utah who desire to at
tend Stanford.
Gamble Fund Large
Another large fund was started
for native-born undergraduate men
in 1934 when George E. Gamble gave
the University $17,000, to which he
has since added until the gift now
has reached approximately $125,000.
Mr. Gamble, who is now living in
Palo Alto, graduated from Stanford
in the class of 1905. He has always
been interested in helping students
and with the aid of his scholarships
about 12 men each year recsive $000,
providing they maintain at least a
"B" average.
First Scholarship
The first scholarship award was
made by the University in 1900 un
der a fund set up by Mrs. Stanford
as a memorial for her son, Leland,
Jr. In those days there was no tui
tion, so the fund of about $480 was
to be used "to pay the living ex
penses, cost of books, fees, and other
necessary expenses of the holder."
Following this in 15)14 the next be
quest of $10,000 was left by W. J.
Dickey "to aid young men from
Fresno County, preferably from
Fresno City, to make their way
through Stanford University."
Scholarship funds are usually es
tablished by bequests or gifts, such
as the Newell and Gamble awards,
or by persons in memory of some
relative or close friend or by vari
ous alumni clubs or organizations,
such as the Stanford Club of Chi
cago or the American Legion.
Vanderburgh Scholarship
For example, the Stanley Wilson
Vanderburgh Memorial Scholarship
was founded by his parents in honor

of their son, who was killed while
riding home from the golf course on
a motorcycle. He had attended
Stanford from 1938 to 1941.
Vanderburgh's picture, along with
several others in whose memory
the funds have been established, is
hanging in the Scholarship office in
the Administration Building.
Another memorial was begun a
year ago by George Bliss Culver,
emeritus Dean of Men, and his wife
in honor of their son, who was killed
in the war.
Some Carry Restrictions
Some scholarships carry restric
tions, although the majority are un
restricted. The Royall Victor Schol
arship is fpr persons who have re
sided at some time in Connecticut,
and the Leonard Daniels Ellis Fund
is for persons from San Diego.
Oftentimes, the donor will stipu
late the branch of study for the re
cipient, as for instance, the Mabel
Hyde Cory Scholarship in history
or the Florence Hecht Fries Fund in
medicine or the John M. liaffner
award :'n law.
