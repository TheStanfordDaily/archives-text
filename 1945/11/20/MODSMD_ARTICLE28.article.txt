# Exhibit at Gallery Illustrates Types Of Modern Art
## 
### 
The exhibit of Painting Repro
ductions which opens today at the
Stanford Art Gallery is designed
primarily to acquaint the college
student with the trends of modern
art and to illustrate the techniques
used by artists to achieve the de
sired effect.
This show is divided into three
main sections. Each group consists
of representative paintings and ex
planations of their characteristics.
"Language of Painting''
The "Language of Painting" shows
the meaning of the terms light, color,
and shape and how they have been
used by various schools of paintingâ€”
Oriental through the Renaissance, to
the 19th century. It also displays
examples of dimention, movement,
and rhythm in painting.
"Landscape Painting" traces the
development of this form of art
through the Italian, Dutch, French,
Spanish, and impressionistic schools.
Approaches to Painting
The third division, "What is Mod
ern Painting?" is a collection of re
productions which show the most
important approaches to painting in
our time. They do not represent a
history of a survey of modern art,
but are grouped according to the
different ideas they express. .Each
picture is accompanied by an ex
planation of the technique it repre
sents and the trend to which it be
longs.
Igor Stravinsky said, "Frankly I
have but little confidence in those
who pose as refined connoisseurs and
passionate admirers of the great
pontiffs of art but who know noth
ing of the art of their own time."
This collection is designed to pro
vide a clear idea of the various
movements of contemporary art.

Gallery's fall series, has been loaned
