# Intolerance May Strangle San Francisco Says Stegner
## 
### 
Racial prejudice and intolerance
can strangle San Francisco if they
become as great as they have in
some cities, commented Dr. Wallace
Stegner, English professor, at the
first annual meeting and dinner of
the Council for Civic Unity at the
Whitcomb Hotel in San Francisco
last night.
Dr. Stegner has recently com
pleted an extensive survey on the
racial minority problem in the Uni
ted States and has published his
conclusions in his latest book, "One
Nation."
Prevent Discrimination
"It is far easier for a city like San
Francisco, with a worthy past and
an exciting future, to prevent dis
crimination against racial minorities
before it starts, to strangle it in its
cradle," stated Dr. Stegner.
"Anyone who wants to pry below
the surface of Chinatown, to exam
ine the conditions in the new col
ored districts that have developed
in recent years, to explore the ra
cial slums in search of something
besides picturesque dirt, can find out
why I think it is imperative to stran
gle the thing now."
Tale of Two Cities ,
In his address the professor point-

Ed out the results of segregation, of j
the "superior-inferior" caste pat- .
tern, by telling a tale of two cities,
Boston and Springfield, Mass., one :
of which has handled its immigra- !
lion problem the wrong way and ono |
the wise and tolerant way.
Dr. Stegncr told of how Boston,
once a homogeneous town with a
civic pride and community spirit,
became "an unhappy city" with the
immigration of the impoverished
Irish one hundred years ago.
Suspicion and Hatred
"Boston met tiie immigration with J
suspicion, hatred, dislike, discrimi
nation. social snobbery, and econom/ j
ic exploitation. The clash of two j
ligions, two cultures, two national
backgrounds, went on sharply until
after the Civil War when the Irish !
won political control and turned the I
tables on the so-called bluebloods.
Ever since the struggle has split |
Boston," he said.
City with Future
By way of contrast, Dr. Stegner
then told how Springfield, "a city
with a present and a future," han
dled its racial problem intelligently
by "choosing to meet the situation i
halfway." Springfield has "no race \
problems, no politically ridden pub- j
lie schools, no venal or cynical police I
force, no graft-ridden city hall. It I
has a community spirit, and a strong j
one, which binds together Poles and
Irish and Yankees and Finns and |
Russians and Jews and Negroes and
all the polyglot populations of the
lown."
Foreseeing possible racial difficul
ties, Springfield evolved a genera
tion ago what is known as the |
Springfield Plan, which has extend- |
ed the principles and practices of
active education for racial democ
racy to their logical limits. Children
are taught to be proud of their racial
backgrounds.
Subsidizing Slums
By insisting upon segregation, we j
subsidize slums. Dr. Stegner pointed j
out, "which means that we subsi
dize vice, crime, delinquency, dis- j
ease, violence and human misery." 1
Of all the segregative tricks the |
worst is the restrictive covenant in !
property deeds, which so far has j
been held to be constitutional.
If San Francisco wants any heal- j
thy community life, it must tear
down the walls that are being built
by easy and unflattering generaliza-
I tions about racial groups, concluded
Dr. Stegner.
