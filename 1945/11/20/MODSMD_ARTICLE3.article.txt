PARIS, Nov. 19 -UP—The French
Constituent Assembly, meeting un
der strong police guard while crowds
of students demonstrated in the
streets, handed Gen. Charies De
Gaulle a victory over French Com
munists today and directed him to
again attempt to form a three-party
coalition government.
De Gaulle accepted the Assembly's
mandate to resume his efforts, once
interrupted by what De Gaulle de
scribed as the insistence of Com
munists upon one of three major
cabinet posts—war, interior, or for
eign affairs. De Gaulle announced

opposed these demands.
Assembly President Felix Gouin
told the press that De Gaulle will
meet representatives of the parties
at 11:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. EST) to
morrow.
But Assembly spokesmen for the
Communists asserted that they

tacked him for taking an allegedly
unpatriotic attitude toward French
Communists, and described him as a
bungler in foreign affairs.
