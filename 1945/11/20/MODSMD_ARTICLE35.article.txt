## SIDELINE SLANTS 
### BOB SLOBE 
Our Indians were magnificent in defeat last Saturday, and the
Stockton Commando game marks a rather decided return of the
Cardinal to the gridiron. Our offense was nothing short of ter
rific to say nothing of the hard charging of the line on defense.
The pass defense out there was nothing to brag about however;
in fact Bob Krieger, guarterback for the Stockton team, had a
field day that he has never seen the likes of before.
KRIEGER TO LYNCH
Had it not been for the Krieger to Lynch pass combination,
and the lack of Stanford passing in the closing moments of the
contest, the Indian team might have chalked up one in the win
column Saturday. Ten thousand people had surprised looks on
their faces when they watched the "Red Machine" roll to a
touchdown when they got possession of the football for the first
time in three years; they weren't surprised when the Commandos
also countered in the first guarter, and went into the lead, v/hen
Krieger booted the extra point. The spirited Stanford rooting
section was again brought to its feet when Barks threw a quick
flanker pass to Martin, who scored the touchdown standing up
from about 25 yards out.
Our team should have led at the half by a score of 20-7, but
here again they waited until the last minute before throwing
passes which were batted down by the then alerted Stockton
defense. Our attack bogged down in the second half, and bullet
passing Krieger made our defenders look even sillier by tossing
two more scoring passes.
BACKFIELD LOOKS GOOD
But now that your capable Monday morning quarterback has
finished his play calling, he would like to say that you were
seeing many of next year's stars on the field Saturday. Half
back Gene Martin is one of the smoothest striding runners we
have ever seen, and the Commandos had trouble with big Fred
Willey, who believes that the shortest distance between two
points is a straight line and also proved it by running right over
the army team's defense. Willey pulled one of the best plays
of the day when he hurdled right over the center of the line —
and we mean hurdled—for a gain of 10 yards.
Don Lipelt also demonstrated that he knew what the score
was and the speedy little back can really scoot. Quarterback
Burks had all the confidence of Frankie Albert out on the turf
except he didn't have enough faith in his passing ability. He
throws bullet like passes with the eye of a trap shooter, and if
he had elected to start pitching, Burks could have made Krieger
look like an amateur. Curt also proved that Coach Schwartz need
not look around for another kicker when he got away some
beauties.
