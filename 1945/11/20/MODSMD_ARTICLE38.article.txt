BOSTON. Nov. 19.—UP—The Bos
ton Traveler said today that Holy
Cross, despite its defeat by Temple
last Saturday, will receive and ac
cept an invitation to play in the
Orange Bowl at Miami on New
Year's Day.
The Traveler story said that "re
gardless of whether official verifica
tion of this statement comes before
or after Sunday's clash with Boston
College at Fenway Park, it can be
stated positively that the Crusaders
did not eliminate themselves from
consideration by their startling set
back."
