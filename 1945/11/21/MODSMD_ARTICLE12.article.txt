# Sharp Explains Raise in Men's Room Cost
## 
### BILL EILERS 
Why were men's University room
expenses hiked this quarter?
The Director of Men's Residences
has the answer in facts and figures
and it boils down to the fact that
without the raise, the University
would be losing many thousands of
dollars each month on these resi
dences.
Dr. Stanley Sharp, Director of
Residences, pointed out that the de
cision to raise expenses came from
the Board of Trustees in the light
that operation of eight ex-fraternity
houses netted a loss of $(>,044 last
year. This quarter the University
is running 20!
University Breaks Kven
Even under the new increase, the
University just about breaks even.

Criticism that fraternities were
exacting too great a rent from the
University, thus raising the indi
vidual costs, is unjustified, accord
ing to Mr. Sharp. "The University
made a very fair contract with the
fraternities," he said, "even though
it looked at times as if one or the
other were losing."
$18 per Room Paid
The fraternities get $18 a room
from the rent paid, which last year
was $40 a room. The Office of Price
Administration had set ceilings.
Previously, fraternities under ac
tive operation had gone into the hole
on room rent, Mr. Sharp reported.
They made up their costs on board
charges.
In an average University - run
house of 30 men, for example, fra

ternities now receive about $<> a j
man. In fraternity life, the average
house bill per person was $55 to $fio
monthly, including room, board,
linen and dues. This, however, in
cluded about five hours of pledge
work per week, totaling about $30
worth of work per quarter for each
nan.
According to Dr. Harold M. Ba
con, Inter-Fraternity Board mem
ber, fraternity house expenses were
on the average not significantly
higher than those of the dormitories, j
Upkeep Costs High
Dr. Sharp told where the chief ex
penses now lay in University oper
ation. For instance .upkeep included
relining boilers at Cleveland and
Taft, each costing $200. This is only
one charge in University upkeep.

1 Broken windows, faulty plumbing,
poor wiring must be corrected by
the University. Heating problems
are bifg.
Utility expenses arc high. Some
halls average over $!)2 a month for
gas and electricity alone! Linen,
garbage, and work by the American i
Building Maintenance Company at j
present rates keep up room rent.
Nothing Set Aside
There are expenses of adminis- j
tration and auditing. Resident as- [
sistants arc paid $75 a month.
In the charges now made for |
rooms by the University, nothing is
being set aside for repair of the j
fraternity houses which may take
place next summer if houses arc re- I
turned by the University.

has the answer in facts and figures
and it boils down to the fact that
without the raise, the University
would be losing many thousands of
dollars each month on these resi
dences.
Dr. Stanley Sharp, Director of
Residences, pointed out that the de
cision to raise expenses came from
the Board of Trustees in the light
that operation of eight ex-fraternity
houses netted a loss of $(>,044 last
year. This quarter the University
is running 20!
University Breaks Kven
Even under the new increase, the
University just about breaks even.

Criticism that fraternities were
exacting too great a rent from the
University, thus raising the indi
vidual costs, is unjustified, accord
ing to Mr. Sharp. "The University
made a very fair contract with the
fraternities," he said, "even though
it looked at times as if one or the
other were losing."
$18 per Room Paid
The fraternities get $18 a room
from the rent paid, which last year
was $40 a room. The Office of Price
Administration had set ceilings.
Previously, fraternities under ac
tive operation had gone into the hole
on room rent, Mr. Sharp reported.
They made up their costs on board
charges.
In an average University - run
house of 30 men, for example, fra

ternities now receive about $<> a j
man. In fraternity life, the average
house bill per person was $55 to $fio
monthly, including room, board,
linen and dues. This, however, in
cluded about five hours of pledge
work per week, totaling about $30
worth of work per quarter for each
nan.
According to Dr. Harold M. Ba
con, Inter-Fraternity Board mem
ber, fraternity house expenses were
on the average not significantly
higher than those of the dormitories, j
Upkeep Costs High
Dr. Sharp told where the chief ex
penses now lay in University oper
ation. For instance .upkeep included
relining boilers at Cleveland and
Taft, each costing $200. This is only
one charge in University upkeep.

1 Broken windows, faulty plumbing,
poor wiring must be corrected by
the University. Heating problems
are bifg.
Utility expenses arc high. Some
halls average over $!)2 a month for
gas and electricity alone! Linen,
garbage, and work by the American i
Building Maintenance Company at j
present rates keep up room rent.
Nothing Set Aside
There are expenses of adminis- j
tration and auditing. Resident as- [
sistants arc paid $75 a month.
In the charges now made for |
rooms by the University, nothing is
being set aside for repair of the j
fraternity houses which may take
place next summer if houses arc re- I
turned by the University.
Why were men's University room
expenses hiked this quarter?
