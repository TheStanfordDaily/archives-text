# Chopin Selection Proves Best of Pianist's Concert

Her too-delicate touch and her
though tf u I - to-monotonous approach
were suitable only to the fragile
Chopin selections played by Alma
Sheasgrecn Harrington at the Tues
day Evening Series in Memorial
Hall last night.
Only in the very weak "Berceuse"
of Chopin did Mis. Harrington ap
pear to be at home and in control of
her medium. Her supple fingering,
overbalanced in the other selections
by a lack of power and all-over dex
terity, was enough to make the
"Berceuse" worth staying awake to
listen to—more than can be said for

the remainder of the program.
Handsome Artist
A tall, fine-looking woman, Mis.
Harrington wore a chartreuse silk
jersey gown and impressed the audi
ence with her stage presence.
The "Ballade, A Flat Major," an
other Chopin piece, was also more
suitable to Mrs. Harrington's tech
nique than were the difficult Bach-
Busoni "Chaconne" and the rapid
"Gavotte and Variations" by Ra
meau.
Opening with the "Gavotte and
Variations," Mrs. Harrington dis
played a "feathery" touch in a spir
itless and fuzzy interpretation and
then stumbled through the difficult
and intricate "Chaeonne." Its vary
ing mods did not seem to be under
stood by the pianist.
Selections Slow
Two Brahms selections, "Inter
mezzo, Op. 117, No. 2," and "Scherzo
in E Flat, Op. 4," were slow and al
together uninteresting, though in
"excellent taste" as one member of
the audience commented.
After intermission the Chopin
"Berceuse" was almost a breath
taking surprise. But the artist, de
spite the fact that she did seem to
be warming up to her program,
again disappointed the audience
with a forceless, jerky interpretation
of "Hungarian Rhapsody, No. 8," by
Liszt. —Pinkerton
