# Inter – Fraternity Council to Discuss University Supervision of Fraternities
## 
### 
(Note. —This is the sccond in a
series of articles dealing with the
return of fraternities to the cam
pus. A third, concerning the Uni
versity's viewpoint, will follow
next week.)
One of the major problems to be
ironed out when Inter - Fraternity
Council reconvenes at the beginning
of next quarter is the question of
University supervision in fraterni
ties.
Ed Luce, newly elected chairman
of Inter-Fraternity Board, indicated
that he plans to sound out the fra
ternities on this and other questions
as soon as possible.
Will Accept Control
Board member Jerry Moore—also
!president of Sigma Chi — believed
that most fraternities would be will
ing to accept some form of more
adequate University control, al
though most were opposed to house
mothers. The University has recom
mended house mothers as a step to
ward "guidance and supervision."
John M. Stalnaker, Dean of Stu
dents, disclosed he "would hope fra
ternities would have house mothers
but I don't think the University will
require them."
Conduct Problem
Mr. Stalnaker revealed a letter he
had received from Kappa Alpha
saying it planned to have a house
mother. Since conduct was the most
serious of problems facing the
"Greeks," Mr. Stalnaker said there
has to be some assurance of an ade
quate type of supervision before the
croups will be permitted to resume
active status.
Immediate problem facing both
council and board Ls the revising of
fraternity rushing and pledging
rules. Besides this, Chairman Luce
plans to meet all freshmen next
quarter to present information con
cerning rushing, pledging, and gen
eral fraternity background.
R.A.'s to Continue
Mr. Stalnaker' said the system of

resident assistants would probably
continue in the independent groups,
after fraternity reactivation. He

further pointed out that fraternities
may rent rooms to outsiders until
they get on their feet again and are
able to pledge enough members to
fill their houses.
Rie Supple, president of Beta, re
ported there were five actives on

campus and he had every hope they
could return to Monroe Hall in the
fall. Members include John Hanlon,
"Buck" Barsotti, Joe Sher, Rolf
Westley, and Morley Thompson.
Lee Morrison, Delta Upsilon pres
ident, said present membership was
12, and that all were "looking for
ward to active fraternity life next
.'all."
Jerry Moore said Sigma Chi had
eight members including newly ini
tiated A 1 Wilkins, Harlan Harmsen,
Bob Slobe, and John Davis.
Inter - Fraternity Board meets
again on December 6.
Commissary May Resume
Incidentally, if Stanford fraterni
ties resume active life again next
fall, the wholesale commissary will,
probably be started again. Previ
ously, it supplied food for 23 of the
24 chapters. During the past ten
years every fraternity house ended
the year with all trade accounts
paid, nothing overdue, and most had
no unpaid bills at the end of the
year. This was possible in large part
through the work of an inter-frator
nity auditor who worked with the
Board Finance Committee to build a
strong financial position.

could return to Monroe Hall in the
fall. Members include John Hanlon,
"Buck" Barsotti, Joe Sher, Rolf
Westley, and Morley Thompson.
Lee Morrison, Delta Upsilon pres
ident, said present membership was
12, and that all were "looking for
ward to active fraternity life next

Jerry Moore said Sigma Chi had
eight members including newly ini
tiated A 1 Wilkins, Harlan Harmsen,
Bob Slobe, and John Davis.
Inter - Fraternity Board meets

Commissary May Resume
Incidentally, if Stanford fraterni
ties resume active life again next
fall, the wholesale commissary will,
probably be started again. Previ
ously, it supplied food for 23 of the
24 chapters. During the past ten
years every fraternity house ended
the year with all trade accounts
paid, nothing overdue, and most had
no unpaid bills at the end of the
year. This was possible in large part
through the work of an inter-frator
nity auditor who worked with the
Board Finance Committee to build a
strong financial position.


ED LUCE, president of Inter-
Fraternity Hoard, which is plan
ning the re-opening of fraternities
on campus.
(Note. —This is the sccond in a
series of articles dealing with the
return of fraternities to the cam
pus. A third, concerning the Uni
versity's viewpoint, will follow
next week.)
One of the major problems to be
ironed out when Inter - Fraternity
Council reconvenes at the beginning
of next quarter is the question of
University supervision in fraterni
ties.
Ed Luce, newly elected chairman
of Inter-Fraternity Board, indicated
that he plans to sound out the fra
ternities on this and other questions
as soon as possible.
Will Accept Control
Board member Jerry Moore—also
!president of Sigma Chi — believed
that most fraternities would be will
ing to accept some form of more
adequate University control, al
though most were opposed to house
mothers. The University has recom
mended house mothers as a step to
ward "guidance and supervision."
John M. Stalnaker, Dean of Stu
dents, disclosed he "would hope fra
ternities would have house mothers
but I don't think the University will
require them."
Conduct Problem
Mr. Stalnaker revealed a letter he
had received from Kappa Alpha
saying it planned to have a house
mother. Since conduct was the most
serious of problems facing the
"Greeks," Mr. Stalnaker said there
has to be some assurance of an ade
quate type of supervision before the
croups will be permitted to resume
active status.
Immediate problem facing both
council and board Ls the revising of
fraternity rushing and pledging
rules. Besides this, Chairman Luce
plans to meet all freshmen next
quarter to present information con
cerning rushing, pledging, and gen
eral fraternity background.
R.A.'s to Continue
Mr. Stalnaker' said the system of

resident assistants would probably
continue in the independent groups,
after fraternity reactivation. He

further pointed out that fraternities
may rent rooms to outsiders until
they get on their feet again and are
able to pledge enough members to
fill their houses.
Rie Supple, president of Beta, re
ported there were five actives on

campus and he had every hope they
could return to Monroe Hall in the
fall. Members include John Hanlon,
"Buck" Barsotti, Joe Sher, Rolf
Westley, and Morley Thompson.
