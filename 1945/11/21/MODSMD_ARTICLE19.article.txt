THANKSGIVING - -1945
The major portion of the student body goes
packing off today by train, bus, plane, or car to
homes wheie % Thanksgiving v/ill be observed
"with turkey and all the trimmins'." And in
all those homes there need not be much
searching to find something to be thankful for
when families sit down to the first peacetime
Thank';jiving in three years.
But iocce is elusive and a dark "if" hangs
over lit- nation as it contemplates the world
situation in atomic energy. Giatilude for the
official end of man's most terrible war is clouded
by the implications of the atom bomb, but we
are still thankful .... to be in a free-thinking
university in a free thinking nation v/here we
can comment, perhaps get action, on aggres
sion in the streets of Soerabaja, civil war in
China, domestic strife at home .... where we
can know that people are still wholeheartedly
hoping, thinking, and working toward peace,
and a better world.
