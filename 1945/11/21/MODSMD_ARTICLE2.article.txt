# Sensabaugh Reads Lyrics Of Four Cavalier Poets
## 
### 
(Jeorge Sensabaugh, associate professor of English, reading from (ho
Cavalier Poets chose four—Thomas Carcw, Sir John Suckling, Richard
Lovelace, and Robert Hcrrick—to exemplify the royalist spirit at the
poetry reading yesterday afternoon.
The Cavalier Poets were loyal to the king at the time of (he Puritan

.Rebellion, and pictured life in "merry
old England." Mr. Sensabaugh said
that he once received a definition
of these poets as men who "made
love with one arm, wrote poetry
with another, and fought for the king
with another." He added that he
never questioned this definition.
Begins with Carcw
The reading began with Thomas
Carcw, who is the most sensuous and
conventional of the Cavalier Poets.
Of his poems, Dr. Sensabaugh read
"The Spring," "Pcrsuations to Love,"
"Murdering Beauty," "Secrecy Pro
tested," "Persuasions to Enjoy," and
three other untitled songs.
From the spontaneous, satirical
poetry of Sir John Suckling Mr. Sen
sabaugh read "The Indication," "Out

Upon It," a song satirizing one of Ben
Jonson's, "A Soldier," ''The Miracle,"
an answer written to an anonymous
| poem, and two drinking songs.
Lovelace Most Serious
Mr. Sensabaugh chose four songs
! to show the work of Richard Love
lace, who is the most serious of this
i group of poets. The songs were un
titled and concerned the war, prison,
and love.
Although Robert Herrick was not
strictly a cavalier, he captured their
spirit.
| The poetry reading series will be
concluded next Tuesday when John
McClelland will read from the po
etry of W. H. Auden and Louis Mac-
Neice.—Betty Barlow
