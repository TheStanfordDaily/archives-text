### STANLEY WILSON 
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving Day and a festive mood
already prevails. But I'm just a little sad. I always
am a little sad around this time of year. You see, I
think of ihe turkeys. I think I'll capitalize it and refer
to lh' in as Turkeys, because I sympathize with them
; rid think so much of them.
1; me no little each year at Thanksgiving 1
and Christinas time when I think of the Turkeys and
thei.* plight in this social set-up. People just don't
think (»112 Turkeys enough. They don't give Turkeys
enough consideration.
Since the days of our Pilgrim ancestors, Turkeys
have been taking a beating and literally losing their
heads and no one seems to care. But I do. I think of
the mi l} sacrifices and contributions Turkeys have
made to our society, and it hurts to know that they
itr* ■ for ''.'often completely.
1 or example, let's take our vocabulary and no
lle just how much the Turkey has offered to extend
it. I do we realize that many of our pet say
ings t ad witticisms come directly from the Turkey
odian influence. Such phrases as "Cold Turkey,"
•'You're a dead Turkey," or "My date Saturday night
was a Turkey," are just a few examples of many.
Very few of if ever give credit, where credit is due,
for such int lligent and popular sayings.
You frobebly wonder how I know so much about
Ttirkf ys and their influence. You see, I come from an
area where lots of Turkeys are raised and I have
talked v,ith them and know. Yes, I have learned to
"talk Turkey." (You see, there's another Turkeyodian
influence in our vocabulary.) In my many conversa
tions on various .subjects with my friends, the Turkeys,
I have come to know them well and realize their sen
sitive characteristics and emotions. I remember once
last ye r I was speaking with my good friend, Thomas
Turkey, and he told me a little of the history of his
race of people.
You see, the Turkeys are the real ones we should
thanl for our Fourth of July celebrations. It all
started when the colonial pioneers wanted to be free
and independent. No one seemed quite capable enough
to handle the tremendous iob of organizing the Colo
nial leaders. George Washington was a great man,
bul he needed ingenius co-workers. Naturally, the
Turkeys were called in for the job. You know what
followed. But it all had to come to an end, as do all
good tilings. The Turkeys became very strong, politi
eallv, being leaders of the Federalist party. They
gained so much power that finally they were ostracized
by the Whigs and deported. "After all," the pioneers
thought, "how could we be represented at international
conferences by Turkeys?" So the Turkeys were
shipped off and far away and soon took up residence
on the shores of the Black Sea, just opposite Greece.
We now refer to that country as Turkey. Insurmount
able, those Turkeys.
[ was surprised when my friend, Thomas, told
mo all these things and it made me feel even a little
more humble and appreciative for all they had done
for us.
hut the Turkeys finally returned to the United
St. tr: . but in a much different capacity. By this time
everyone had forgotten about their services during the
Revolutionary War and a great famine had hit our
country. Since Turkeys possessed more edible meat
per s ;uare inch than anyone else, they naturally were
the ones to suffer. And so it has continued and always
shall, I suppose. But the Turkeys aren't bitter. They
ire such altruistic beings that they believe they are

doing a great humanitarian service and are satisfied
with their mission to mankind.
So tomorrow think of the Turkeys and all they
have done for you. Be jus! a little sad. Ise just a
little sympathetic and realize the Turkey's sensi
tivity. lie feels this thing much more than you do.
Pay a small homage to him before you dive for the
while meat. Don't think so much of your delight in
eating; think of the sacrifices the Turkeys have made.
I believe our thought for tomorrow should be that
these Turkeys have not lost their heads in vain; that
they shall live forever in our memories ami affec
tions. 11. truly shall be a day of Thanksgiving. A day
of thanks lor the Turkey.

I have come to know them well and realize their sen
sitive characteristics and emotions. I remember once
last ye r I was speaking with my good friend, Thomas
Turkey, and he told me a little of the history of his
race of people.
You see, the Turkeys are the real ones we should
thanl for our Fourth of July celebrations. It all
started when the colonial pioneers wanted to be free
and independent. No one seemed quite capable enough
to handle the tremendous iob of organizing the Colo
nial leaders. George Washington was a great man,
bul he needed ingenius co-workers. Naturally, the
Turkeys were called in for the job. You know what
followed. But it all had to come to an end, as do all
good tilings. The Turkeys became very strong, politi
eallv, being leaders of the Federalist party. They
gained so much power that finally they were ostracized
by the Whigs and deported. "After all," the pioneers
thought, "how could we be represented at international
conferences by Turkeys?" So the Turkeys were
shipped off and far away and soon took up residence
on the shores of the Black Sea, just opposite Greece.
We now refer to that country as Turkey. Insurmount
able, those Turkeys.
[ was surprised when my friend, Thomas, told
mo all these things and it made me feel even a little
more humble and appreciative for all they had done
for us.
hut the Turkeys finally returned to the United
St. tr: . but in a much different capacity. By this time
everyone had forgotten about their services during the
Revolutionary War and a great famine had hit our
country. Since Turkeys possessed more edible meat
per s ;uare inch than anyone else, they naturally were
the ones to suffer. And so it has continued and always
shall, I suppose. But the Turkeys aren't bitter. They
ire such altruistic beings that they believe they are

doing a great humanitarian service and are satisfied
with their mission to mankind.
So tomorrow think of the Turkeys and all they
have done for you. Be jus! a little sad. Ise just a
little sympathetic and realize the Turkey's sensi
tivity. lie feels this thing much more than you do.
Pay a small homage to him before you dive for the
while meat. Don't think so much of your delight in
eating; think of the sacrifices the Turkeys have made.
I believe our thought for tomorrow should be that
these Turkeys have not lost their heads in vain; that
they shall live forever in our memories ami affec
tions. 11. truly shall be a day of Thanksgiving. A day
of thanks lor the Turkey.
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving Day and a festive mood
already prevails. But I'm just a little sad. I always
am a little sad around this time of year. You see, I
think of ihe turkeys. I think I'll capitalize it and refer
to lh' in as Turkeys, because I sympathize with them
; rid think so much of them.
1; me no little each year at Thanksgiving 1
and Christinas time when I think of the Turkeys and
thei.* plight in this social set-up. People just don't
think (»112 Turkeys enough. They don't give Turkeys
enough consideration.
Since the days of our Pilgrim ancestors, Turkeys
have been taking a beating and literally losing their
heads and no one seems to care. But I do. I think of
the mi l} sacrifices and contributions Turkeys have
made to our society, and it hurts to know that they
itr* ■ for ''.'often completely.
1 or example, let's take our vocabulary and no
lle just how much the Turkey has offered to extend
it. I do we realize that many of our pet say
ings t ad witticisms come directly from the Turkey
odian influence. Such phrases as "Cold Turkey,"
•'You're a dead Turkey," or "My date Saturday night
was a Turkey," are just a few examples of many.
Very few of if ever give credit, where credit is due,
for such int lligent and popular sayings.
You frobebly wonder how I know so much about
Ttirkf ys and their influence. You see, I come from an
area where lots of Turkeys are raised and I have
talked v,ith them and know. Yes, I have learned to
"talk Turkey." (You see, there's another Turkeyodian

with their mission to mankind.
So tomorrow think of the Turkeys and all they
have done for you. Be jus! a little sad. Ise just a
little sympathetic and realize the Turkey's sensi
tivity. lie feels this thing much more than you do.
Pay a small homage to him before you dive for the
while meat. Don't think so much of your delight in
eating; think of the sacrifices the Turkeys have made.
I believe our thought for tomorrow should be that
these Turkeys have not lost their heads in vain; that
they shall live forever in our memories ami affec
tions. 11. truly shall be a day of Thanksgiving. A day
of thanks lor the Turkey.
