To the Editor:
The obvious reason which set the atomic-bomb
ballot into circulation was to demonstrate 1o the United
States government that this University gives its com
plete support toward the establishment of a world
federation, above national sovereignty—a statement
which increases in power and influence with the
number of universities that send such a request.
The fact that 506 students out of the 3,546 that
Stanford has, which amounts to less than one-seventh,
approve of such a measure, slates implicitly either
that the overwhelming majority do not approve of it,
and that the official governing body of Stanford Uni
versity is not truly representative, or that the majority
of the students are completely indifferent to one of
the most decisive issues that this planet has ever ex
perienced. I am of the firm belief that a great number
of students refused to vote simply because of the in
appropriate way in which the ballot was presented
to us.
Therefore I propose that the Executive Committee
take immediate and definite action, disregarding the
possibility thai the results of the ballot have already
been sent to Washington, because Ibis fact is rela
tively so insignificant to the extensive scope of this
problem of world government and atomic-energy
control, that it could well be cast aside. Thus I ap
peal to Exconi, particularly to the Freshman Class
representative, George Eckstein, to incite the accom
plishment of the following steps:
1. To head an extensive campaign on campus by
means of lectures and articles in the Daily, through
the valuable aid of the instructors, who, I am sure,
would more than gladly present the different aspects
of the problem—its advantages, disadvantages, and
difficulties—as has already been done once in this
paper. The main point in this should be to interest
and inform us about the problem, to make us feel the
moral responsibility to vote. This campaign should
not last more than two days, but in these the problem
should become the main topic in every conversation
on campus, the main topic in the Disily.
2. To conduct a new vote within three days or less,
if possible: the ballots should consist of three squares,
one to be checked if in favor, one if in opposition, and
a third one, undecided. The ballots having been
counted, Excom should report the results to Wash
ington.
3. To invite other colleges in the country to do the
same.
If Stanford has a genuine desire to take an active
share in the solution of this problem through Excom,
we ought to demonstrate it more vigorously; it will
have greater possibilities for success if vve give an
exact account of the opinion of AI.L the 3,546 stu
dents of Stanford University, rather than just a
vague description of one-seventh, a fact which would
seem to indicate that the majority of us is definitely
against this measure.
This is an exceedingly important question, and
nothing worse can be done to it than to remain in
different. Indifference is the greatest peril to democ
racy.

To the Editor:
The obvious reason which set the atomic-bomb
ballot into circulation was to demonstrate 1o the United
States government that this University gives its com
plete support toward the establishment of a world
federation, above national sovereignty—a statement
which increases in power and influence with the
number of universities that send such a request.
The fact that 506 students out of the 3,546 that
Stanford has, which amounts to less than one-seventh,
approve of such a measure, slates implicitly either
that the overwhelming majority do not approve of it,
and that the official governing body of Stanford Uni
versity is not truly representative, or that the majority
of the students are completely indifferent to one of
the most decisive issues that this planet has ever ex
perienced. I am of the firm belief that a great number
of students refused to vote simply because of the in
appropriate way in which the ballot was presented
to us.
Therefore I propose that the Executive Committee
take immediate and definite action, disregarding the
possibility thai the results of the ballot have already
been sent to Washington, because Ibis fact is rela
tively so insignificant to the extensive scope of this
problem of world government and atomic-energy
control, that it could well be cast aside. Thus I ap
peal to Exconi, particularly to the Freshman Class
representative, George Eckstein, to incite the accom
plishment of the following steps:
1. To head an extensive campaign on campus by
means of lectures and articles in the Daily, through
the valuable aid of the instructors, who, I am sure,
would more than gladly present the different aspects
of the problem—its advantages, disadvantages, and
difficulties—as has already been done once in this
paper. The main point in this should be to interest
and inform us about the problem, to make us feel the
moral responsibility to vote. This campaign should
not last more than two days, but in these the problem
should become the main topic in every conversation
on campus, the main topic in the Disily.
2. To conduct a new vote within three days or less,
if possible: the ballots should consist of three squares,
one to be checked if in favor, one if in opposition, and
a third one, undecided. The ballots having been
counted, Excom should report the results to Wash
ington.
3. To invite other colleges in the country to do the
same.
If Stanford has a genuine desire to take an active
share in the solution of this problem through Excom,
we ought to demonstrate it more vigorously; it will
have greater possibilities for success if vve give an
exact account of the opinion of AI.L the 3,546 stu
dents of Stanford University, rather than just a
vague description of one-seventh, a fact which would
seem to indicate that the majority of us is definitely
against this measure.
This is an exceedingly important question, and
nothing worse can be done to it than to remain in
different. Indifference is the greatest peril to democ
racy.
