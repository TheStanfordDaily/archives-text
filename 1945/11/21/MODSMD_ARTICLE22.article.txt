# TEST FILE

To the Editor:
A mad scramble in fraternity and ex-sorority house
files for old tests the night before an examination may
appeal to many students, but for those who live off
carnpus, those who aren't lucky enough to uncover
the light tests at the right lime, it's a decided handi
cap.
Sure, it's a fact that cramming old tests the night
before an exam is permissible—and extremely help
ful. Studying old multiple-choice questions is a
good way of checking your progress in that course.
Getting other slants by reading bluebook essays of
past years is good.
Hit and miss application of such a valid method
of study should not be the case. Why couldn't a sys
tem for studying old tests be standardized?
A regular file of old exams from every department
could be kept in a central library department. Fold
ers comprehensively covering a year's tests might be
filed in the reserve room, subject to the same regula
tions as cover books in that room. Ten copies of each
old test might be submitted by the professor giving the
exam, submitted probably in total at the end of each
quarter.
Costs of providing such a service would be rea
sonable compared to other library services. If the
library would not take up such a project, it might be
arranged through the A.S.S.LJ. or each University
department.
Beginning biology presents a list of a hundred or
so suggested questions. Many literature and history
courses offer a list of essay questions which might be
asked usually upon the urging of the students.
To get this file under way, students should give up
long-cherished old tests.
We'll like to hoar from the teaching staff about such
a project.
