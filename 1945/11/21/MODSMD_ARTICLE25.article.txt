# Typical Hollywood Style Featured in 'State Fair'
## 
### 
"State Fair," a dolled-up version of the Will Rogers starrer of a dec
ade ago, will satisfy those who expect the usual Hollywood convention
alities. There's a whole slug of pretty girls and singing, all ot which
comprises a rather undistinguished, but diverting, group of niceties.
Jeanne Crain, cast as the typical country lass, and Dana Andrews, as a

fast-talking newspaperman from the 4
"big city," carry on the principal I
romantic interest, and Dick Haymes
and Vivian ("Cherry Blonde")
Blaine also consume a good deal of
footage frothing at the mouth.
"Blue Boy"—Just a Dreamer
Charles Winninger appears in an

abbreviated ver
sion of the role
held by the late
Will Rogers. You
may dimly re
member the hog
"Blue Boy" that
gets sleepy at
the wrong time
but nevertheless
wins the grand
prize.

"State Fair" is so highly stylized
there's no use in hashing over the
plot. We'd just like to say that the
setting of the fair is as take as are
the mannerisms of most Stanford
women. And the "extras" shown
milling around the mid-way cer
tainly bear no resemblance to the
typical lowa rustic.
Music for the Mob
But there's plenty of Rodgers and
liammerstein music for the juke
box trade, the foremost tunes being
"That's for Me" and"It Might as
Well Be Spring." These are moaned
alternately by Haymes and Miss
Cherry Blonde, much to the delight
of the yokels present.
"State Fair," however, may give
you a charge if there's nothing do
ing this week-end. Otherwise, you
may be of the opinion that it's a
rather mediocre blend of singing and
sentiment.—Dick Bower
