TEHRAN, Nov. 20.—(UP)—Iran
ian troops marching to the relief of
besieged garrisons in revolt-torn
Azerbaijan Province in the Soviet
occupied zone of Iran have been
halted by the Russians and ordered
to return here, it was announced
today.
Reports circulated that the gov
ernment would send a "mission to
Moscow" to discuss the crisis.
The Russians, under the 1942
agreement whereby the Allies occu
pied parts of Iran to facilitate the
flow of lend-lease goods across the
Caucasus, have the power to pre
vent Iranian troops from entering
their zone. The Russians are to
evacuate Iran by March 2.
Delayed reports said that fierce
fighting was raging between Iran
ian garrison troops in (he town of
Mianeh, 2*i() miles northwest of
Tehran, and Democratic Party
forces, which the government has
charged include immigrants from
Soviet Armenia. The revolt broke
out last Friday with the rebels, ac
cording to the government spokes
man supplied arms distributed by
Russian trucks and identified as
weapons seized by the Russians
when they moved into the country.
Parliament meanwhile held an
other secret session and later the
deputies visited Premier Abrahim
Hakimi.
