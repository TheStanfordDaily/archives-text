# Farm Grad, Unusual Costumes To Highlight Opening of 'Sea Gull'
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
"The Sea Gull," which opens its
six-night run November 28, marks
the return of James Clancy, active
in Stanford plays a few years ago
and who now is taking advanced
training at the University this quar
ter. Mr. Clancy, who opens in the
leading role of Tregorin in Che
khov's play, is directing dramatics
at San Jose State College.
All the members of the cast are
experienced players of senior or
graduate standing. The part of Pre
plev, the young author in love with
Nina (Patricia Nielsen), is being
taken by another San Jose State
College man, William Melton. The
many inter-plots of this story are
further complicated by Masha,
played by Lorna Robertson, who is
in love with Preplev.
The role of Arcadina, which was
taken by Lynn Fontanne in the
Theater Guild's production, will be
played by Barbara Welch, who will
he remembered for her Gaieties role.
Tregorin was played by Alfred Lunt
in New York.
Arcadina's brother, Sorin, will be
played by Hal Campbell; Walter Pa
lance will be the country doctor,
Dorn; Roll in Buckman, the manager
of the estate; and Marjorie Walsh,
his wife. Janice Swan and Charles
Smurr have supporting roles.
Elaborate Costumes
Mrs. Muriel B. Lievsay, costume
director, and her department have
outdone themselves on costuming
the play. Many of the more ornate
dresses are gifts to the department
but they are hard to distinguish

from the ones made by the depart- 1
ment out of the materials at hand, j
The elaborate hand embroidery
work on many of the women's !
dresses is the personal work of Mrs. j
Lievsay and her staff.
The play, set in the 1890's in Rus- !
sia, calls for narrow lapels and trou- j
sers for the men's costumes. An- ]
other featur? of their attire will be I
their high collars tied by bows or !
strings. The vogue of balloon sleeves j
which made their debut in 1895 is j
apparent in the women's dresses.
One of the most striking costumes
in the play is a gold brocade dress
trimmed in black jet worn by Miss
Welch in the opening scene. White
is particularly stressed in the cos
tumes of Miss Nielson. A beautiful
white sequined robe, a gift to the
department, is worn by her during
her appearance in the play within
a play. As she matures during the
play her clothes become more re
strained.
Walsh Clothes Restrained
Marjorie Walsh, in her role ns the
wife of the steward, wears dresses
of a darker color tone than most of
the female characters. Though not
dressed as a servant, her clothes re
veal that she has not quite as much
money as the others. An authentic
purple dress of that time, made of
beautiful old material, is one of her
most outstanding costumes. A dark
[ somber note is indicated in the
| dresses of Lorna Robertson, who is
1 clothed in black throughout the en
[ tire play. Toward the end of the
last act, however, her costume is
| touched with a little color. All the
women's skirts show the straight line
I in the front and the fullness in the
1 back characteristic of that period.
Hal Campbell's costumes are pad
! ded during the first part of the play
to indicate the plumpness of Sorin,
but as the play progresses his loss
of weight and his round shoulders
become apparent through his cos
tuming. A striking black dress suit
is his formal attire.
Hats a la Mode
The women's hats have been fash
ioned from hats many years old or
have been revamped from modern
hats. A touch of feathers or an up
turned brim has changed these hats
into exact duplicates of those worn
during the '90's.
Shoes have been the biggest prob
lem for the costuming department.
The narrow, pointed shoes of that
period were not made for the broad
er feet of today. The women, how
ever, have undergone a little pain
in order to make even this small

detail of their costumes authentic.
F. Cowles Strickland, director, j
stated that this Chekhov tragedy
had been under production before
the war but because of the lack of
advanced students work had to be
abandoned until this quarter. The
usual five-day run of such a play
has been extended because of the
limited capacity of the Little Thea
ter, and an extra performance will
be given at 8:30 Tuesday night fol
lowing the Tuesday Evening Series.
