ther on the "Farm" or at home will

bers and old friends to commemo

slovakia, 200 student delegates from
United Nations and neutral coun
tries sit around a conference table
in commemoration of International

Q.A., the United States Student As
sembly, the American Youth for De
mocracy, American Unitarian Youth,
and the Southern Negro Youth Con
gress, are present at the conference
table.
International Student Federation
It is the hope of these 200 repre
sentatives attending the first post
war World Students' Congress from
November 17 to 23, to draft a con
stitution for a new International
Federation of Students. Dr. Eduard
Bones, President of the Czechoslo
vak Republic, Prime Minister Attlcc,
President Truman, and Marshal Sta
lin have addressed or broadcast mes
sages of encouragement to the con
ference.
The goals of the new world stu
dents' federation arc, in general:
1. To act as THE representative
international student organization.
2. To provide means of encour
aging co-operation between demo
cratic national organizations of
students.
To promote friendship be

tween students of different coun
tries.
4. To promote the well-being
and improve the educational
standards of all students in order
to enable them to play a full part
as democratic citizens.
Federation Proposal
To attain these goals, the new fed-

eration proposes to "represent stu
dent opinion as defined by the
I Council of tlv: Federation, organize
I international student conferences,
distribute information on student
! interests in all countries, organize
international student travel and
I promote international student ex
i change, and organize international
J student sport activities."

Thc.se objectives arc being consid
ered today at Prague. In addition
the representatives are discussing
the federation's relationship to oth
er groups with similar aims—par
ticularly to the Educational and
Cultural Organization of the United
Nations.
Federation'—Old Idea
The idea of an effective and active
world federation of students is not
new. In the early years of World
War 11, students and teachers sought
refuge in Great Britain. England
became "the clearing house of ideas"
from Europe's ocupied and fighting
countries.
According to information released
from the United Nations Informa
tion Office, an informal group of del
egates from national student organi
zations met in London in March
1945. Their purpose was to decide
whether to revive the dying Inter
national Students' Assembly, or to
create a new organization instead.
New Constitution
The group chose to work toward
a new International Federation of
Students. In August, 1945, a com
mittee of seven nationalities—Can
ada, China, France, Great. Britain,
Yugoslavia, Russia, and the United
States —drew up a constitution for
a new permanent organization.
The constitution was submitted to
a preliminary meeting in London,
November 10 to 11, and finally to
the World Students' Congress in
Prague. The present draft and in
corporated proposed amendments
will be circulated among national
student organizations following the
conference.
If the constitution is generally ap
proved, it will provide a working
basis for a future conference in the
summer of 1940. This time the dele
gates will have full authorization to
ratify the new charter—for an In
ternational Federation of Students
all over the world.

It is the hope of these 200 repre
sentatives attending the first post
war World Students' Congress from
November 17 to 23, to draft a con
stitution for a new International
Federation of Students. Dr. Eduard
Bones, President of the Czechoslo
vak Republic, Prime Minister Attlcc,
President Truman, and Marshal Sta
lin have addressed or broadcast mes
sages of encouragement to the con
ference.
The goals of the new world stu
dents' federation arc, in general:
1. To act as THE representative
international student organization.
2. To provide means of encour
aging co-operation between demo
cratic national organizations of
students.
To promote friendship be

tween students of different coun
tries.
4. To promote the well-being
and improve the educational
standards of all students in order
to enable them to play a full part
as democratic citizens.
Federation Proposal
To attain these goals, the new fed-

eration proposes to "represent stu
dent opinion as defined by the
I Council of tlv: Federation, organize
I international student conferences,
distribute information on student
! interests in all countries, organize
international student travel and
I promote international student ex
i change, and organize international

Thc.se objectives arc being consid
ered today at Prague. In addition
the representatives are discussing
the federation's relationship to oth
er groups with similar aims—par
ticularly to the Educational and
Cultural Organization of the United

Federation'—Old Idea
The idea of an effective and active
world federation of students is not
new. In the early years of World
War 11, students and teachers sought
refuge in Great Britain. England
became "the clearing house of ideas"
from Europe's ocupied and fighting
countries.
According to information released
from the United Nations Informa
tion Office, an informal group of del
egates from national student organi
zations met in London in March
1945. Their purpose was to decide
whether to revive the dying Inter
national Students' Assembly, or to
create a new organization instead.
New Constitution
The group chose to work toward
a new International Federation of
Students. In August, 1945, a com
mittee of seven nationalities—Can
ada, China, France, Great. Britain,
Yugoslavia, Russia, and the United
States —drew up a constitution for
a new permanent organization.
The constitution was submitted to
a preliminary meeting in London,
November 10 to 11, and finally to
the World Students' Congress in
Prague. The present draft and in
corporated proposed amendments
will be circulated among national
student organizations following the
conference.
If the constitution is generally ap
proved, it will provide a working
basis for a future conference in the
summer of 1940. This time the dele
gates will have full authorization to
ratify the new charter—for an In
ternational Federation of Students
all over the world.
