# Lemaitre Derives Art Interest From Trips to European Cities

Georges E. Lemaitre, professor of I
Romanic Languages, is giving a se
ries of lectures on Modernistic
Painters at the California School of
Fine Arts throughout November in ;
San Francisco.
It was in Paris as a student that
Mr. Lemaitre first became really 1
interested in art. By his weekly I
visits to the "Louvre," he began to !
understand and appreciate the great
painters of the day and of the past, j
Lemaitre Visits Spain
Spurred on by this interest, Mr.
Lemaitre visited Italy, Spain (par- i
ticularly the art centers of Madrid
and Seville) Holland, and the city
of Dusseldorf in Germany.
In Dusseldorf he became friendly
with a German painter, who intro
duced him to the "paint-box." This
was a building built by the system
atic Germans to group all the artists
in a particular city.
With the aid of this painter, Mr.
Lemaitre familiarized himself with
the style and technique of various
artists. There is a famous painting
in which St. Paul, a central figure, is
wearing a strikingly beautiful red
cloak. The reason for the radiance
of this color is that the artist ap
plied a basic coat of vivid green
I and then covered that with red.

Mr. Lemaitre stresses the point
that he is not an artist in the strict
sense of sitting down and being able
to paint a masterpiece—rather he is
a connoisseur and has kept the ap
preciation of art as his hobby.
Students were the means whereby
Mr. Lemaitre realized that his hobby
could be profitted by others. He be
gan to see that whereas he was
teaching literature and might be
dwelling on the appreciation of Ger
trude Stein, his students were more
interested in her counterpart in
painting.
Because Mr. Lemaitre has a great

understanding of art and knows lit
erature to a very great extent, he
began to dwell particularly, with the
philosophy and the psychology of an
artist.
Mr. Lemaitre says that there are
many people who are experts on the
period of Rennaissance Art, but that
the Modernists, of whom Cezanne
is the first, are too new for many to
completely know and understand
them. Mr. Lemaitre however is
among the few who know as much
as possible about the techniques,
the purposes, and the realizations of
the Cubists, the Futurists, the Sur
realists, the Dadaists, and the vari
ous other groups.
Modernists Growth
One is better able to understand
the Modernists than say the Ren
naissance artists, because, through
out their growth the former have
been closely associated with writ
ers. Through words the layman is
better able to understand why a
certain contemporary picture was
painted.
Although the Modernists are clas
sified in various groups, basically
they all work towards the expres
sion of a common thought, that of
breaking down the superficially of
the world and all its contents, and
the case of a person, the individual's
finding the essential element. In
real self is mainly cloaked by his
intelligence as put over by his brain
The smashing of this intelligence
and all other superficialities is the
concern of the Modernists.
How Do They Do It?
How do they go about it? There
are several groups already men
tioned, which vary in their tech
niques and in their approach to
their subjects. They do not regard
a book simply as a book in the ma
terial sense, but rather they use the
object, in this case a book, to ex
emplify their own emotions and
soul.
The "why's" and the "where
fores's" of the names of various
divisions are very interesting. Mr.
Lemaitre has some unusual infor
mation on "Dadaism," a division
which may be considered by the
layman as among the least known.
"On February i>, 1916. in the
course of a tumultous gathering
held at the 'Cafe Terrasse,' they
(Richard Huelsenbeck, a Geripan
poet in exile, Hans Arp, an Alsatian

woodcarver, Dr. Val Serner, fresh
from the University of Geneva, and
a young Russian named Tristan
Tzara) decided to adopt a name
which intended to show that they
had given up every hope for human
intelligence and were expecting still
worse inanity from the future.
"Tristan Tzara then plunged a
paper cutter at random into the
pages of "Dictionnaire Larouse,"
! opened the book, and read the word
thus indicated: "Dada."
' "Dada" Meaningless
" 'Dada' is a childish utterance
! which is supposed to satnd for the
difficult word 'cheval.' (trans, horse).
| n fact, more often than not, Dada'
| means nothing at all in the mind of
I an infant who prattles and babbles
i incoherently.

Mr. Lemaitre says that there are
many people who are experts on the
period of Rennaissance Art, but that
the Modernists, of whom Cezanne
is the first, are too new for many to
completely know and understand
them. Mr. Lemaitre however is
among the few who know as much
as possible about the techniques,
the purposes, and the realizations of
the Cubists, the Futurists, the Sur
realists, the Dadaists, and the vari
ous other groups.
Modernists Growth
One is better able to understand
the Modernists than say the Ren
naissance artists, because, through
out their growth the former have
been closely associated with writ
ers. Through words the layman is
better able to understand why a
certain contemporary picture was
painted.
Although the Modernists are clas
sified in various groups, basically
they all work towards the expres
sion of a common thought, that of
breaking down the superficially of
the world and all its contents, and
the case of a person, the individual's
finding the essential element. In
real self is mainly cloaked by his
intelligence as put over by his brain
The smashing of this intelligence
and all other superficialities is the
concern of the Modernists.
How Do They Do It?
How do they go about it? There
are several groups already men
tioned, which vary in their tech
niques and in their approach to
their subjects. They do not regard
a book simply as a book in the ma
terial sense, but rather they use the
object, in this case a book, to ex
emplify their own emotions and
soul.
The "why's" and the "where
fores's" of the names of various
divisions are very interesting. Mr.
Lemaitre has some unusual infor
mation on "Dadaism," a division
which may be considered by the
layman as among the least known.
"On February i>, 1916. in the
course of a tumultous gathering
held at the 'Cafe Terrasse,' they
(Richard Huelsenbeck, a Geripan
poet in exile, Hans Arp, an Alsatian

woodcarver, Dr. Val Serner, fresh
from the University of Geneva, and
a young Russian named Tristan
Tzara) decided to adopt a name
which intended to show that they
had given up every hope for human
intelligence and were expecting still
worse inanity from the future.
"Tristan Tzara then plunged a
paper cutter at random into the
pages of "Dictionnaire Larouse,"
! opened the book, and read the word
thus indicated: "Dada."

Painters at the California School of
Fine Arts throughout November in ;
San Francisco.

painters of the day and of the past, j
Lemaitre Visits Spain
Spurred on by this interest, Mr.
Lemaitre visited Italy, Spain (par- i
ticularly the art centers of Madrid
and Seville) Holland, and the city
of Dusseldorf in Germany.
In Dusseldorf he became friendly
with a German painter, who intro
duced him to the "paint-box." This
was a building built by the system
atic Germans to group all the artists
in a particular city.
With the aid of this painter, Mr.
Lemaitre familiarized himself with
the style and technique of various
artists. There is a famous painting
in which St. Paul, a central figure, is
wearing a strikingly beautiful red
cloak. The reason for the radiance
of this color is that the artist ap
plied a basic coat of vivid green
I and then covered that with red.
; llobhy Helps Others
Mr. Lemaitre stresses the point
that he is not an artist in the strict
sense of sitting down and being able
to paint a masterpiece—rather he is
a connoisseur and has kept the ap
preciation of art as his hobby.
Students were the means whereby
Mr. Lemaitre realized that his hobby
could be profitted by others. He be
gan to see that whereas he was
teaching literature and might be
dwelling on the appreciation of Ger
trude Stein, his students were more
interested in her counterpart in
painting.
Because Mr. Lemaitre has a great

understanding of art and knows lit
erature to a very great extent, he
began to dwell particularly, with the
philosophy and the psychology of an
artist.

Georges E. Lemaitre, professor of I
Romanic Languages, is giving a se
ries of lectures on Modernistic
Painters at the California School of
Fine Arts throughout November in ;
San Francisco.
It was in Paris as a student that
Mr. Lemaitre first became really 1
interested in art. By his weekly I
visits to the "Louvre," he began to !
understand and appreciate the great
painters of the day and of the past, j
Lemaitre Visits Spain
Spurred on by this interest, Mr.
Lemaitre visited Italy, Spain (par- i
ticularly the art centers of Madrid
and Seville) Holland, and the city
of Dusseldorf in Germany.
In Dusseldorf he became friendly
with a German painter, who intro
duced him to the "paint-box." This
was a building built by the system
atic Germans to group all the artists
in a particular city.
With the aid of this painter, Mr.
Lemaitre familiarized himself with
the style and technique of various
artists. There is a famous painting
in which St. Paul, a central figure, is
wearing a strikingly beautiful red
cloak. The reason for the radiance
of this color is that the artist ap
plied a basic coat of vivid green
I and then covered that with red.
; llobhy Helps Others
Mr. Lemaitre stresses the point
that he is not an artist in the strict
sense of sitting down and being able
to paint a masterpiece—rather he is
a connoisseur and has kept the ap
preciation of art as his hobby.
Students were the means whereby
Mr. Lemaitre realized that his hobby
could be profitted by others. He be
gan to see that whereas he was
teaching literature and might be
dwelling on the appreciation of Ger
trude Stein, his students were more
interested in her counterpart in
painting.
Because Mr. Lemaitre has a great

understanding of art and knows lit
erature to a very great extent, he
began to dwell particularly, with the
philosophy and the psychology of an
artist.
Mr. Lemaitre says that there are
many people who are experts on the
period of Rennaissance Art, but that
the Modernists, of whom Cezanne
is the first, are too new for many to
completely know and understand
them. Mr. Lemaitre however is
among the few who know as much
as possible about the techniques,
the purposes, and the realizations of
the Cubists, the Futurists, the Sur
realists, the Dadaists, and the vari
ous other groups.
Modernists Growth
One is better able to understand
the Modernists than say the Ren
naissance artists, because, through
out their growth the former have
been closely associated with writ
ers. Through words the layman is
better able to understand why a
certain contemporary picture was
painted.
Although the Modernists are clas
sified in various groups, basically
they all work towards the expres
sion of a common thought, that of
breaking down the superficially of
the world and all its contents, and
the case of a person, the individual's
finding the essential element. In
real self is mainly cloaked by his
intelligence as put over by his brain
The smashing of this intelligence
and all other superficialities is the
concern of the Modernists.
How Do They Do It?
How do they go about it? There
are several groups already men
tioned, which vary in their tech
niques and in their approach to
their subjects. They do not regard
a book simply as a book in the ma
terial sense, but rather they use the
object, in this case a book, to ex
emplify their own emotions and
soul.
The "why's" and the "where
fores's" of the names of various
divisions are very interesting. Mr.
Lemaitre has some unusual infor
mation on "Dadaism," a division
which may be considered by the
layman as among the least known.
"On February i>, 1916. in the
course of a tumultous gathering
held at the 'Cafe Terrasse,' they
(Richard Huelsenbeck, a Geripan
poet in exile, Hans Arp, an Alsatian
