# McElroy to Analyze Effect Of Narcotics Today at 4:15
## 
### 
"Effect of Narcotics on Enzyme Systems'' will l>e the topic of William I).
McElroy a research associate in Ihe biological science department, who
will speak at the department's weekly seminar at 4:15 p.m. today in room
430, Jordan Hall.
Dr. McElroy is a National Research Council Fellow at Stanford. He

received the B.A. from Stanford in
1939.
From a study of the effect, of vari
ous inhibitors, such as the barbitu
rates, sulfanilamide, and alcohols,
on various enzyme systems it has
become possible to designate a par
ticular mechanism by which these
compounds work. At normal tem

perature enzymes usually exist in
equilibrium between an active and
an inactive form.
Render Enzymes Inactive
From the present study it is
found that the various narcotics
influence this process in such a
way as to render particular en
zymes inactive. By studying their
mechanism of action and utilizing
various narcotics with different
chemical properties it has been pos
sible to demonstrate that the vari
ous theories of narcotics I'esolve into
one and the same theory.
An enzyme system which has been
particularly useful in analyzing the
mechanism of inhibitor action is the
one concerned with bioluminescence.
In this system the enzyme oxidizes
a particular compound with subse
quent light emission. The firefly
light is a familiar example of this.
Intensity of Light
The rate of this bioluminescent
reaction determines the intensity of
light. Factors which influence the
enzyme in this reaction such as tem
perature pr.essure, and inhibitors,
will alter the rate of reaction and
consequently the intensity of light.
Thus the effect of various narcot
ics can be studied on this system in
the living organism by merely meas
uring the intensity of light in their
presence.
The seminar will be preceded by a
tea at 4 p.m. Students, faculty, and
visitors are invited to attend.
