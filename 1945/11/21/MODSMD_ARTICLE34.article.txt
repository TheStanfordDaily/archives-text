# Modern Dormitories, Apartments Set for Fall; New Union Planned
## 
### MELLON SHELTON BETH MacVICAR 
Stanford of the future is now in
blueprint form and will definitely
begin to take shape by next fall,
according to Eldridge T. Spencer,
director of planning.
Occupying top priority on the list
of University plans is housing, plans
for which were approved at last
week's meeting of the Board of
Trustees. Drawings for one-story,
California-style houses, to hoUse
upper division and graduate stu
dents, are now posted on the walls
of Mr. Spencer's office in the basp
ment of the Business School.
Ultra-modern Units
Each of these units will be built
in ultra-modern style with full
length windows along the front, and
each will be subdivided into three
sections, each section housing ten
students. In each, the ten rooms
will surround a common living room
for that particular group.
As yet, said Mr. Spencer, eating
plans are still in the tentative stage.
The new living units have no dining
accommodations, and the 200 or 300
students who will live in these
houses will probably have a large
eating commons of their own, cen
trally located near the living groups,
Mr. Spencer said.
Apartments for married students,
separate living units of two apart
ments apiece, will be constructed in
the same style. Favored site for the
new housing project is the area by

Lake Lagunita, main advantages of
which are the centralization of all
University housing, and the sloped
terrain which gives the illusion of
space and privacy.
Departments Centralized
During the reconstruction of vari
ous areas around the Quad attempts
will be made to centralize depart
ments and groups which depend on
one another for communication and
which in themselves constitute au
tonomous units of administration.
Athletics will continue to be organ
ized around the stadium and the
8.A.C.; the corporation yard will be
moved to this area to leave room for
a block of student activities build
ings. All student body offices, a new
Union (dining and recreation facil
ities for the newly-constructed resi
dences), and a new building for the
University Press, which will house
all student publications, are included
in the plans for this block.
A tentative suggestion has been
made to tear down the post office
and rebuild it near the Press, to
facilitate mailing and to further cen
tralize student relations. The incon
gruity of locating the Press, a man
ufacturing plant, in the same area
with student administrative offices
would be offset by the advantage of
close contact with student activities,
a necessity for a representative Uni
versity Press, said Mr. Spencer.
Public assemblage areas are al
ready centrally organized—the Frost
Amphitheater and Memorial Audi

torium are located to the left and
front of Quad. The three libraries,
and art gallery form a separate "cul
tural" unit. Academic classrooms
and administration offices are lo
cated in the periphery of the Quad.
Planned for ndcpcndcnce
The proposed housing though it
attempts to centralize, is designed
for as much self-government as pos
sible for its residents. Present Uni
versity housing consists of the large
two-and-three story buildings like
Roble and Encina, and the detached
wood structures of the Row units;
design of the new houses was di
rected especially for older groups of
students who desire more independ
ence in their living.
Building by building, according to
Mr. Spencer, existent houses will be
inspected and brought up to uniform
standards. Sequoia will not be re
paired as the cost of doing so would
recommend building an entirely new
structure instead. Should other
houses be found in such disrepair,
they will be abandoned as Univer
sity residences.
Enrollment Increases
Housing has in the past been a
deterrent to enrollment, especially
for out-of-state students, according
to Mr. Spencer. As soon as proposed
living-groups are completed, and
other less difficult features brought
into alignment, the student body
.can, said Mr. Spencer, be expanded
to 5,000 or 6,000, or a 50 per cent

increase in enrollment.
Stanford's original planning has
allowed for convenient and practical
expansion aronud the perimeter of
Quad. Noted from the plans drawn
up before construction of the Uni
versity are two extra Quads, one on
either side of the present Quad. The
detail of the loop road at the end of
Palm Drive* was planned for horse
and-buggy days, acording to Mr.
Spencer.
Early Plan
Housing was originally intended
for the areas to the left and right of
the front of Quad, at either side of
the loop. Despite changes in these
plans, the nucleus of extant build
ings has never proved awkward in
further arrangement.
Studies are being made at present
for the maximum utilization of class
room space. Since Stanford is pri
marily a morning University, space
for lectures hns always been at a
premium; if Stanford operated on a
morning - afternoon - and - evening
schedule as does Cornell, three times
the number of class periods could
be held, or three times the number
of students be accommodated, ac
cording to Mr. Spencer.
The area near Toyon—the open
lots behind the libraries—has been
reserved for major developments,
developments not yet underway.
Although housing is the first on the
calendar of changes, others men
tioned will be effected as soon as
possible, according to Mr. Spencer.

Studies are being made at present
for the maximum utilization of class
room space. Since Stanford is pri
marily a morning University, space
for lectures hns always been at a
premium; if Stanford operated on a
morning - afternoon - and - evening
schedule as does Cornell, three times
the number of class periods could
be held, or three times the number
of students be accommodated, ac
cording to Mr. Spencer.
The area near Toyon—the open
lots behind the libraries—has been
reserved for major developments,
developments not yet underway.
Although housing is the first on the
calendar of changes, others men
tioned will be effected as soon as
possible, according to Mr. Spencer.
Stanford of the future is now in
blueprint form and will definitely
begin to take shape by next fall,
according to Eldridge T. Spencer,
director of planning.
Occupying top priority on the list
of University plans is housing, plans
for which were approved at last
week's meeting of the Board of
Trustees. Drawings for one-story,
California-style houses, to hoUse
upper division and graduate stu
dents, are now posted on the walls
of Mr. Spencer's office in the basp
ment of the Business School.
Ultra-modern Units
Each of these units will be built
in ultra-modern style with full
length windows along the front, and
each will be subdivided into three
sections, each section housing ten
students. In each, the ten rooms
will surround a common living room
for that particular group.
As yet, said Mr. Spencer, eating
plans are still in the tentative stage.
The new living units have no dining
accommodations, and the 200 or 300
students who will live in these
houses will probably have a large
eating commons of their own, cen
trally located near the living groups,
Mr. Spencer said.
Apartments for married students,
separate living units of two apart
ments apiece, will be constructed in
the same style. Favored site for the
new housing project is the area by

Lake Lagunita, main advantages of
which are the centralization of all
University housing, and the sloped
terrain which gives the illusion of
space and privacy.
Departments Centralized
During the reconstruction of vari
ous areas around the Quad attempts
will be made to centralize depart
ments and groups which depend on
one another for communication and
which in themselves constitute au
tonomous units of administration.
Athletics will continue to be organ
ized around the stadium and the
8.A.C.; the corporation yard will be
moved to this area to leave room for
a block of student activities build
ings. All student body offices, a new
Union (dining and recreation facil
ities for the newly-constructed resi
dences), and a new building for the
University Press, which will house
all student publications, are included
in the plans for this block.
A tentative suggestion has been
made to tear down the post office
and rebuild it near the Press, to
facilitate mailing and to further cen
tralize student relations. The incon
gruity of locating the Press, a man
ufacturing plant, in the same area
with student administrative offices
would be offset by the advantage of
close contact with student activities,
a necessity for a representative Uni
versity Press, said Mr. Spencer.
Public assemblage areas are al
ready centrally organized—the Frost
Amphitheater and Memorial Audi

torium are located to the left and
front of Quad. The three libraries,
and art gallery form a separate "cul
tural" unit. Academic classrooms
and administration offices are lo
cated in the periphery of the Quad.
Planned for ndcpcndcnce
The proposed housing though it
attempts to centralize, is designed
for as much self-government as pos
sible for its residents. Present Uni
versity housing consists of the large
two-and-three story buildings like
Roble and Encina, and the detached
wood structures of the Row units;
design of the new houses was di
rected especially for older groups of
students who desire more independ
ence in their living.
Building by building, according to
Mr. Spencer, existent houses will be
inspected and brought up to uniform
standards. Sequoia will not be re
paired as the cost of doing so would
recommend building an entirely new
structure instead. Should other
houses be found in such disrepair,
they will be abandoned as Univer
sity residences.
Enrollment Increases
Housing has in the past been a
deterrent to enrollment, especially
for out-of-state students, according
to Mr. Spencer. As soon as proposed
living-groups are completed, and
other less difficult features brought
into alignment, the student body
.can, said Mr. Spencer, be expanded
to 5,000 or 6,000, or a 50 per cent

increase in enrollment.
Stanford's original planning has
allowed for convenient and practical
expansion aronud the perimeter of
Quad. Noted from the plans drawn
up before construction of the Uni
versity are two extra Quads, one on
either side of the present Quad. The
detail of the loop road at the end of
Palm Drive* was planned for horse
and-buggy days, acording to Mr.
Spencer.
Early Plan
Housing was originally intended
for the areas to the left and right of
the front of Quad, at either side of
the loop. Despite changes in these
plans, the nucleus of extant build
ings has never proved awkward in
further arrangement.

allowed for convenient and practical
expansion aronud the perimeter of
Quad. Noted from the plans drawn
up before construction of the Uni
versity are two extra Quads, one on
either side of the present Quad. The
detail of the loop road at the end of
Palm Drive* was planned for horse
and-buggy days, acording to Mr.
Spencer.
Early Plan
Housing was originally intended
for the areas to the left and right of
the front of Quad, at either side of
the loop. Despite changes in these
plans, the nucleus of extant build
ings has never proved awkward in
further arrangement.
Studies are being made at present
for the maximum utilization of class
room space. Since Stanford is pri
marily a morning University, space
for lectures hns always been at a
premium; if Stanford operated on a
morning - afternoon - and - evening
schedule as does Cornell, three times
the number of class periods could
be held, or three times the number
of students be accommodated, ac
cording to Mr. Spencer.
The area near Toyon—the open
lots behind the libraries—has been
reserved for major developments,
developments not yet underway.
Although housing is the first on the
calendar of changes, others men
tioned will be effected as soon as
possible, according to Mr. Spencer.
Stanford of the future is now in
blueprint form and will definitely
begin to take shape by next fall,
according to Eldridge T. Spencer,
director of planning.
Occupying top priority on the list
of University plans is housing, plans
for which were approved at last
week's meeting of the Board of
Trustees. Drawings for one-story,
California-style houses, to hoUse
upper division and graduate stu
dents, are now posted on the walls
of Mr. Spencer's office in the basp
ment of the Business School.
Ultra-modern Units
Each of these units will be built
in ultra-modern style with full
length windows along the front, and
each will be subdivided into three
sections, each section housing ten
students. In each, the ten rooms
will surround a common living room
for that particular group.
As yet, said Mr. Spencer, eating
plans are still in the tentative stage.
The new living units have no dining
accommodations, and the 200 or 300
students who will live in these
houses will probably have a large
eating commons of their own, cen
trally located near the living groups,
Mr. Spencer said.
Apartments for married students,
separate living units of two apart
ments apiece, will be constructed in
the same style. Favored site for the
new housing project is the area by

Lake Lagunita, main advantages of
which are the centralization of all
University housing, and the sloped
terrain which gives the illusion of
space and privacy.
Departments Centralized
During the reconstruction of vari
ous areas around the Quad attempts
will be made to centralize depart
ments and groups which depend on
one another for communication and
which in themselves constitute au
tonomous units of administration.
Athletics will continue to be organ
ized around the stadium and the
8.A.C.; the corporation yard will be
moved to this area to leave room for
a block of student activities build
ings. All student body offices, a new
Union (dining and recreation facil
ities for the newly-constructed resi
dences), and a new building for the
University Press, which will house
all student publications, are included
in the plans for this block.
A tentative suggestion has been
made to tear down the post office
and rebuild it near the Press, to
facilitate mailing and to further cen
tralize student relations. The incon
gruity of locating the Press, a man
ufacturing plant, in the same area
with student administrative offices
would be offset by the advantage of
close contact with student activities,
a necessity for a representative Uni
versity Press, said Mr. Spencer.
Public assemblage areas are al
ready centrally organized—the Frost
Amphitheater and Memorial Audi

torium are located to the left and
front of Quad. The three libraries,
and art gallery form a separate "cul
tural" unit. Academic classrooms
and administration offices are lo
cated in the periphery of the Quad.
Planned for ndcpcndcnce
The proposed housing though it
attempts to centralize, is designed
for as much self-government as pos
sible for its residents. Present Uni
versity housing consists of the large
two-and-three story buildings like
Roble and Encina, and the detached
wood structures of the Row units;
design of the new houses was di
rected especially for older groups of
students who desire more independ
ence in their living.
Building by building, according to
Mr. Spencer, existent houses will be
inspected and brought up to uniform
standards. Sequoia will not be re
paired as the cost of doing so would
recommend building an entirely new
structure instead. Should other
houses be found in such disrepair,
they will be abandoned as Univer
sity residences.
Enrollment Increases
Housing has in the past been a
deterrent to enrollment, especially
for out-of-state students, according
to Mr. Spencer. As soon as proposed
living-groups are completed, and
other less difficult features brought
into alignment, the student body
.can, said Mr. Spencer, be expanded
to 5,000 or 6,000, or a 50 per cent

increase in enrollment.
