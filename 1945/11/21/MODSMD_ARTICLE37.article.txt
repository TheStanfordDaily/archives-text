## 
### 
Buchanan Hall urgently needs
six more full-time hoarders for
the rest of this quarter if they are
to continue operation of the dining
hall, Charlie Clark announced last
night.
Cost to full-time boarders is
approximately $40 for the rest of
the quarter.
Applications should be made
immediately to Clark, table man
ager at Buchanan.
