### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (UP).-A
stripped - down B-29 Superfortress
today established a new world's
non-stop distance record of 8,198
miles, flying from Guam to Wash
ington in 35 hours and five minutes
in an Army demonstration of this
country's vulnerability to "enemy
attacks from vast distances."
The sleek bomber averaged about
234 miles per hour in bettering by
1,040 miles the previous non-stop
distance record of 7,158 miles set by
British airmen in 1938 on a flight
from Egypt to Australia. It left
Guam at 2:30 a.m. (EST) Monday
and landed at National Airport at
1:35 p.m. (EST).
Crew Honored
The crew of 10, led by Col. Clar
ence S. Irvine of St. Paul, Neb., and
Lt. Col. George R. Stanley of West
Hartford, Conn., pilots, were award
ed the Distinguished Flying Cross by
Gen. H. H. Arnold, commander of
the Army Air Forces, immediately
after they alighted from the plane.
Arnold, warmly greeting the rec
ord-makers, told Irvine:
"That was a grand flightâ€”beating
the world record by over a thousand
miles. Did you have any trouble."
"No trouble at all," Irvine replied.
Proves Vulnerability
Their flight was the latest, in a

series designed, according to the
War Department, to demonstrate (1)
how easily U.S. long-range planes
could bomb great distances away
and (2) how vulnerable this country
could be to "enemy attacks from
vast distances."
The War Department said the
flight also showed "the fundamental
aeronautical smallness of the world''
and proves that "only through con
stant experiment and trial can wc
maintain dominant air power."
