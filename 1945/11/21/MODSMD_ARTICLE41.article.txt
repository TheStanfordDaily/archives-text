# Museum of Natural History's Display Shows Battle of Organism for Survival

Most Stanford students confuse
fie Natural History Museum with
t ie Liberal Arts Museum, accord

ing to Ira L. Wiggins, professor of
biology and Director of the Natural
History Museum. The Museum of
Natural History is not for the pur
pose of display but to help biology
students by showing them how an
organism fights the battle of sur
vival.
"In contrast to the laboratory
work done in Jordan Hall, where
living things are studied under rig
idly controlled conditions, we are
primarily interested in how animals
react to different environments.
There is still more to know about
how they get along with each other,
and why they don't," said Professor
Wiggins.

Dr. Wiggins first became interest
ed in the School of Biology after he
had dropped a geology class to en
roll in a course in botany because
"the woman of the moment" was
taking botany, not geology. He re
cenved the Bachelor of Arts degree
at Occidental, then came to Stanford
for his postgraduate work. He be
came a Ph.D. in 1929 after two years
of concentrated study. Dr. Wiggins
has been a member of the Stanford
faculty ever since then.
Quinine Research
Professor Wiggins spent seven
months in Ecuador doing field re
search on quinine for the Foreign
Economic Administration. World
War II cut off the United States'
supply of quinine from Java; there
fore, other sources must be made
available. It was found that in some
of the uncultivated soil of the South
American Andes, it could be grown
successfully. Quinine has also been
grown experimentally in North
America but it requires special cli
matic and soil conditions. Our frost
is too heavy and the water supply
is insufficient to be practical. Also,
the ideal water must have a low
lime content. The South American
output of quinine, however, in
creased our supply to a great extent,
said the professor of biology.
Side Show
Stanford's Natural History Mu
seum is not without a collection of
nature's phenomena. There is a
specimen of the Australian spoon

bill, egg-laying mammal, the Platy
pus. The museum also boasts a liz
ard that has three eyes, the third be
ing a "living fossil" in the middle
of the forehead; three of the Cali
fornia condor, considered to be an
almost extinct species. Lt. Telford
Work, a medical student here on
campus, was fortunate in getting
colored movies showing the devel
opment of a baby condor from the
egg and the period of five months
following, commented the Director
of the Museum.
Being chiefly interested in botany,
Professor Wiggins spent a summer
looking up types of plants, described
in 1844 by George Bentham, of new
species found on the West Coast of
America. To carry on this work, he
went to the Royal Botanical Gar
dens of Kew in England.
Bentham had described the speci
mens found by two English doctors,
Hinds, and Barclay, on a govern
ment assignment. They sailed south
from San Francisco on a cargo ship
carrying sulfur, and at every port
where the boat dropped anchor the
doctors added to their collection of
plant lil'e. The Stanford Museum
of Natural History also has a num
ber of type specimens from which
new species- have begun and from
which new species are described.
Natural History Originals
"Our collection is given unusually
good care, as they are to us what
the original manuscript of one of
Shakespeare's plays would be to the
literary critic. These specimens are
the documentary evidence on which
a name of a species is based," added
Dr. Wiggins.
The Museum here has an exten
sive collection of amphibians, a fair
aggregation of reptiles, an excellent
representation of marine and in
vertebrate life. Part of the latter
collection is still unworked because
the Museum staff hasn't had the time
required to investigate thoroughly
the specimens brought back by a
ten years' expedition in the waters
of the Pacific 40 years ago. "There
is a lot of work here for someone
with the training and the interest,"
stated Professor Wiggins.
