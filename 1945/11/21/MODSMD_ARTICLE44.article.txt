# Hopkins Set Up Marine Study For Benefit of Farm Students
## 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
The Hopkins Marine Station, lo
cated on Cabrillo Point, Pacific
Grove, was founded by Timothy
Hopkins in 1882. Hopkins was im
pressed by the Naples Laboratory
and the one at Woods Hole, Massa
chusetts, and decided that Stanford
should have one also.
David Starr Jordan, first president
of Stanford. Charles Henry Gilbert,
and Oliver P. Jenkins were also as

sociated with the founding. In 1936
Hopkins left his estate to support
the marine station.
Two Laboratories
The station has two laboratories,
the Alexander Agassiz Laboratory,
which houses the natural history
section; and the Jacques Loeb unit,
which was a gift of the Rockefeller
Foundation. This latter experimen
tal laboratory provides special re
search laboratories, aquaria, and a
library.
The fisheries research in the nat
ural history section is under the di
rection of Dr. Rolf Bolin. The Uni
ted States Bureau of Fisheries is
housed there also. The bureau
works with the sardine industry at
Monterey, which is one of the larg
est coast fishery centers. Recent rec
lamation begun on waste materials
from the sardine has not only made
one industry $80,000 in one year, but
also made the water less contami
nated and decreased the odors.
Dr. Tage Skogsberg, a marine
biologist, once did oceanographic
surveys at the station. Dr. Gilbert
M. Smith, world authority on Pa
cific Coast algae, has written a book,
â€¢'Algae of Monterey Bay," in which
he clarified the relationships be
tween algae. His book did much to
aid companies engaged in obtaining

algae for commercial purposes after
the rupture of trade with Japan be
cause of the war.
Blinks Directs Experiments
The experimental building is un
der the direction of Dr. Lawrence
Blinks, also director of the marine
station. Dr. Blinks, an authority on
bioelectric potentials, has worked on
photosynthesis in algae. He has
shown that the red pigment in red
algae participates in photosynthesis,
and that enables these plants to. live
at depths below those of other algae.
Dr. Blinks will speak at the Bio
logical Science Department's semi
nar on December 5 on "Rapid Re
cording of the Time Course in Pho
tosynthesis."
Dr. Cornelis van Niel, a world au
thority on sulfur bacteria, has stud
ied photosynthesis of purple and
green sulfur bacteria. He has shown
that these organisms give off oxi
dized sulfur compounds in place of
oxygen given off in ordinary photo
synthesis. This gives a different
prospective of photosynthesis im
possible when work was done only
on green plants.
Summer Classes
Classes are given at the station
every summer on micro-biology,
comparative physiology, experimen
tal embryology, ecology-field biol
ogy, algae, ichthyology, and marine
animals.
About 20 to 30 students go to the
station to study during the summer,
however, there have been as many
as 60 there at times. Graduate stu
dents work at the station through
out the year.
Visiting Scientists
During the summer a number of
other scientists come to do experi
mental work and give courses. The
scientists are mostly composed of
men from the University of Califor
nia and the Oregon universities;
however, some Easterners also come.
Ordinarily an outstanding biologist
is brought to give a scries of semi
nars to both staff and students.
Dr. Arthur C. Giese and Dr.
Douglas Whitaker of Stanford as
well as Dr. Smith go to the marine
station every summer; however, Dr.
Whitaker has been on leave for the
past few summers.
A University bulletin has been
published giving full details on the
marine station.
