# FDR, Hull Hoped to Bluff Japan – Adm. Richardson
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. -(UP)—The laie President Roosevelt and for
mer Secretary of State Cordell Hull apparently believed that by basing the
U.S. fleet in Hawaii in 1940 against the advice of naval commanders they
were arming themselves with such a strong diplomatic hand that Japan
overt act. Admiral J. C. Richardson would be bluffed out of committing an
said today.
Richardson also told the Congressional Pearl Harbor inquiry that in 1940

Mr. Stanley Hornbeck, state depart
ment adviser on Far Eastern Affairs,
apparently had more influence over
disposition of the fleet than he him
self did, although he was Com
mander-in-Chief at the time.
Hornbeck's Influence
"I got that impression about Dr.
Hornbeck" he testified. He added
that he wrote in his notebook after
a meeting with Hornbeck, "He
(Hornbeck) is Ihe strong man in the
Far East and the cause of our stay
ing in Hawaii and he will keep us
there as lopg as he can." He said
he also wrote at the time that Horn
beck "was unwilling to accept the
responsibility for retaining the fleet
in Hawaii.
He also testified that President
Roosevelt considered setting up a
Navy patrol in October, 1940, to
"shut off" shipping between Japan
and the Western Hemisphere. This
in effect would have been a block
ade.
Plan Revealed
He said the plan was revealed to
him by the then Secretary of the
Navy, Frank Knox. Richardson said
he protested vigorously that "in my
opinion it would mean war."
He said that Knox had reported
that he had talked with the Presi
dent and that Mr. Roosevelt "was
concerned about the Japanese re
action to the British re-opening of
the Burma Road."
Richardson's Reply
"In my opinion it would mean
war," Richai'dson said he told Knox.
"In my opinion we would lose ships.
In my opinion we can't stop trade
with Japan and South America with
out being in trouble with both of
them."
Richardson brought Hornbeck's
name into the inquiry when Senator
Owen Brewster, Rep., Maine, asked
him "where did you get the impres
sion that Japan could be bluffed?"
Previously the Admiral had testi
fied that he got the impression dur
ing a special trip to Washington to
ascertain this country's military in
tentions in the Pacific. He had flown

ominously in the Far East.
Call on Roosevelt
Richardson said he called on Mr.
Roosevelt at the White House July
8, 1940. He said he urged that the
fleet be brought to the U.S. West
Coast supplied for any eventuality
and that Navy personnel be in
creased.
But the President held to his be
lief that the fleet should be kept at
Hawaii, Richardson said, and he also
opposed the Admiral's suggestion
that more men be recruited. The
President argued that mechanics
could be inducted quickly if their
services were needed.

fied that he got the impression dur
ing a special trip to Washington to
ascertain this country's military in
tentions in the Pacific. He had flown

ominously in the Far East.
Call on Roosevelt
Richardson said he called on Mr.
Roosevelt at the White House July
8, 1940. He said he urged that the
fleet be brought to the U.S. West
Coast supplied for any eventuality
and that Navy personnel be in
creased.
But the President held to his be
lief that the fleet should be kept at
Hawaii, Richardson said, and he also
opposed the Admiral's suggestion
that more men be recruited. The
President argued that mechanics
could be inducted quickly if their
services were needed.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. -(UP)—The laie President Roosevelt and for
mer Secretary of State Cordell Hull apparently believed that by basing the
U.S. fleet in Hawaii in 1940 against the advice of naval commanders they
were arming themselves with such a strong diplomatic hand that Japan
overt act. Admiral J. C. Richardson would be bluffed out of committing an
said today.
Richardson also told the Congressional Pearl Harbor inquiry that in 1940

Mr. Stanley Hornbeck, state depart
ment adviser on Far Eastern Affairs,
apparently had more influence over
disposition of the fleet than he him
self did, although he was Com
mander-in-Chief at the time.
Hornbeck's Influence
"I got that impression about Dr.
Hornbeck" he testified. He added
that he wrote in his notebook after
a meeting with Hornbeck, "He
(Hornbeck) is Ihe strong man in the
Far East and the cause of our stay
ing in Hawaii and he will keep us
there as lopg as he can." He said
he also wrote at the time that Horn
beck "was unwilling to accept the
responsibility for retaining the fleet
in Hawaii.
He also testified that President
Roosevelt considered setting up a
Navy patrol in October, 1940, to
"shut off" shipping between Japan
and the Western Hemisphere. This
in effect would have been a block
ade.
Plan Revealed
He said the plan was revealed to
him by the then Secretary of the
Navy, Frank Knox. Richardson said
he protested vigorously that "in my
opinion it would mean war."
He said that Knox had reported
that he had talked with the Presi
dent and that Mr. Roosevelt "was
concerned about the Japanese re
action to the British re-opening of
the Burma Road."
Richardson's Reply
"In my opinion it would mean
war," Richai'dson said he told Knox.
"In my opinion we would lose ships.
In my opinion we can't stop trade
with Japan and South America with
out being in trouble with both of
them."
Richardson brought Hornbeck's
name into the inquiry when Senator
Owen Brewster, Rep., Maine, asked
him "where did you get the impres
sion that Japan could be bluffed?"

fied that he got the impression dur
