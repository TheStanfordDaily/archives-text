# Cap and Gown Announces Sale Of More Calendars, Monday
## 
### 
More Cap and Gown calendars
have arrived from the bindery and
will be sold Monday at the Cellar
all day and at the post office from 11
to 12 a.m. and from 1 to 2 p.m., an
nounced Barbara Lamb. The first
group proved such a success that
they were all sold by Monday.
The calendars are a new desk size
this year, and each page just cov
ers a week instead of a month as it
should make them handy for diaries
or engagement books, emphasized
Miss Lamb.
ilustrations
Fifty-two photographs of college
and the near-by scenes decorate the
calendars. The illustrations which
are done in sepia-tone are all in
one color, either in different tones
of blue, green or brown. Most of the
photography was done by Ed Mc-
Lellen.
The first calendars were sold in
1940 for the raising of a scholai-ship
fund. Before this the money for the
fund had come from benefit card
parties or food sales. Five hundred
were printed in this first group.
The idea was brought from Scripps
College by Miss Rosamond Clarke,

director of Roble Hall. For the first
calendars most of the pictures were
taken by Cap and Gown members.
Calendar Printing
This year 3,000 are being printed
by the University Press to be sold
nationally through bookstores and
alumni clubs. Cap and Gown will
receive a percentage of these profits
and with this extra help hopes to
finance two scholarship funds in
stead of the usual one.
One of the most interesting cal
endars published by the society was
in 1941 in commemoration of Stan
ford's fiftieth anniversary. The early
days of the University were pictured,
with prints of the steeple of the
Memorial Church and the Roble
bridge, points which are no longer
in existence. The steeple and parts
of the Church were destroyed in the
earthquake of 1906.
