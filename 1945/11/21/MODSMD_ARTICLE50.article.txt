### BOB PECK 
William Tucker, United Press sports writer, in a release yes
terday advanced a proposal for unbeaten Army to meet the
National Professional League champion on Christmas Day.
We're against such a proposal. For the first reason we think
; it unwise to mix college and professional football. Professional
football has already helped kill college football in some areas
and has announced its intentions, with the All-America League,
i to come back even stronger next year.
Secondly, amateur athletes lack the proper physical training
to compete with harder tackling professional outfits. Not that
Army would be at a disadvantage with any professional club,
but logically, if this game went through, other college outfits
might be pitted against professional teams in future years. Physi
cally, college squads are not organized to meet the rigid stand
j aids employed by the professionals.
Third, the college spirit, that for our part makes up college
football, is totally lacking in professional football. This kind of
football is strictly on a cash basis—there's no glory of dying for
old Siwash—it's played for the money that's in the pocket books
of the customers.
It would seem totally unwise to mix college football with
Ihat of professional. College football has maintained a fairly
clean record for itself throughout the years. Bribes and gambling
among the players is at a minimum. To mix college players with
professional players who are playing strictly for the money in
volved, would be to admit that college football is a failure.
If Army is restless around the first of the year, why don't they
accept the Rose Bowl bid to play U.C.L.A. or Southern Cali
! fornia?

Before St. Mary's got beaten by U.C..L.A. last Saturday, 3
U.S.C. sports writer asked in the "Daily Trojan" that St. Mary's
be invited to the Rose Bowl in place of U.S.C. Now we think
this is a very nice gesture. It's impossible to imagine many of
the other P.C.C. schools advocating that a non-conference mem
ber get invited to the Rose Bowl in their place.
Of course, now with the defeat of St. Mary's, such a proposal
is decadent. But it was a nice thought while it lasted. One of
1 the nicest we've heard from the Trojans in quite awhile.
Stanford will probably not play an Eastern opponent on the
gridiron next Fall. Instead Stanford will play six or seven con
ference opponents and a couple of Bay area schools. Santa
Clara will undoubtedly be on the schedule and U.S.F. is a dis
tinct possibility. As it looks now, the Big Game will be here at
Palo Alto and the U.S.C. game in Los Angeles. Of course when
the conference schedule is drawn up in December, the Stanford
grid plans may change.
★ 1e ★ ★
The basketball schedule for this winter has not yet been re
leased but will probably be published in the Daily next week.
Tenative plans have placed San Jose State, College of the Pa
j cific, Santa Clara, and U.S.F. on the Stanford schedule. During
| Christmas recess, the Indians will travel to Reno to dedicate a
, new auditorium there. Stanford will play games with Utah and
I Nevada while in Reno. California will also play the Rocky
Mountain schools durin gthe dedication ceremonies.
Stanford will play a full conference schedule starting in Jan
uary. They will play each of the Southern Division clubs four
times (California, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.). Two of each set of
j games will be played here at the Pavilion.

Before St. Mary's got beaten by U.C..L.A. last Saturday, 3
U.S.C. sports writer asked in the "Daily Trojan" that St. Mary's
be invited to the Rose Bowl in place of U.S.C. Now we think
this is a very nice gesture. It's impossible to imagine many of
the other P.C.C. schools advocating that a non-conference mem
ber get invited to the Rose Bowl in their place.
Of course, now with the defeat of St. Mary's, such a proposal
is decadent. But it was a nice thought while it lasted. One of
1 the nicest we've heard from the Trojans in quite awhile.
Stanford will probably not play an Eastern opponent on the
gridiron next Fall. Instead Stanford will play six or seven con
ference opponents and a couple of Bay area schools. Santa
Clara will undoubtedly be on the schedule and U.S.F. is a dis
tinct possibility. As it looks now, the Big Game will be here at
Palo Alto and the U.S.C. game in Los Angeles. Of course when
the conference schedule is drawn up in December, the Stanford
grid plans may change.
★ 1e ★ ★
The basketball schedule for this winter has not yet been re
leased but will probably be published in the Daily next week.
Tenative plans have placed San Jose State, College of the Pa
j cific, Santa Clara, and U.S.F. on the Stanford schedule. During
| Christmas recess, the Indians will travel to Reno to dedicate a
, new auditorium there. Stanford will play games with Utah and
I Nevada while in Reno. California will also play the Rocky
Mountain schools durin gthe dedication ceremonies.
Stanford will play a full conference schedule starting in Jan
uary. They will play each of the Southern Division clubs four
times (California, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.). Two of each set of
j games will be played here at the Pavilion.
William Tucker, United Press sports writer, in a release yes
terday advanced a proposal for unbeaten Army to meet the
National Professional League champion on Christmas Day.
We're against such a proposal. For the first reason we think
; it unwise to mix college and professional football. Professional
football has already helped kill college football in some areas
and has announced its intentions, with the All-America League,
i to come back even stronger next year.
Secondly, amateur athletes lack the proper physical training
to compete with harder tackling professional outfits. Not that
Army would be at a disadvantage with any professional club,
but logically, if this game went through, other college outfits
might be pitted against professional teams in future years. Physi
cally, college squads are not organized to meet the rigid stand
j aids employed by the professionals.
Third, the college spirit, that for our part makes up college
football, is totally lacking in professional football. This kind of
football is strictly on a cash basis—there's no glory of dying for
old Siwash—it's played for the money that's in the pocket books
of the customers.
It would seem totally unwise to mix college football with
Ihat of professional. College football has maintained a fairly
clean record for itself throughout the years. Bribes and gambling
among the players is at a minimum. To mix college players with
professional players who are playing strictly for the money in
volved, would be to admit that college football is a failure.
