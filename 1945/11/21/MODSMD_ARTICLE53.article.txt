### AL SCIARONI 
In its first demonstration before
| the student body in three years, the
Stanford varsity basketball squad
j Tuesday night showed great prom
! ise of being a contender in the Pa
cific Coast Conference this year.
In their defeat of the San Fran
cisco Marines, 37-28, the ball club
looked very smooth. Incidentally,
the Marines had been defeated in
their first game by California, 30-
21. This seems to show that the
| Indians are at least on an equal
with the boys from Berkeley.
The Daily sports staff would like
to apologize, to players and students
alike, because of the lack of pub
licity on the game. Our only excuse
I is that we were not notified of the
i contest. We shall see that it doesn't
I happen again. Sorry.
Football Squad Needs Fundamentals
Stanford's football squad, in the
j opinion of this writer, lost the game
j Saturday mainly because of one rea
j son. The lack of the fundamentals
j of football. Those fundamentals are
! blocking and tackling.
We are not blaming either the
coach or the players for not having
these fundamentals down pat. We
realize that the practice time was
short, and that they had to spend
the short practice period learning
the plays. Now that the plays have
; been mastered, the blocking, tack
; ling, and pass defense should be
; gotten down as pat as the plays. If
! ibis is done we can look forward to
j a victory on December 1.
Prestige Is Going Up
The prestige of the Pacific Coast
Conference was increased a hun
j dredfold last Saturday afternoon
I thanks to the Bruins of U.C.L.A.
The defeat of the much-vaunted
Gaels showed that the conference
teams were not as bad as they have
| been written up to be. U.C.L.A. has
| undoubtedly proved that it is now
| the top team on the Pacific Coast.
The Little Bears from Southern
| Cal come north this week to play
i their "big"' brothers from Berkeley.
| The Bruins are a lot more Golden
| than their brothers and should come
out on the top side of the score.
! The Bruins have improved tre
| mendously since the beginning of
j the season, and have lost only to
their next-door neighbors, the Tro
ians. December 1 will probably be
the day on which we know who is
going to represent the conference in
the Rose Bowl. On that day the
Bruins and the Trojans clash in the
Coliseum. Although the Bruins were
j defeated in their first contest with
U.S.C., we see no reason why the
I tables shouldn't be turned this time.
In fact we see no reason to make us
I think that the Trojans can win.
Coach Jimmy Phelan of St. Mary's
| has announced that the Gaels arc
| hanging up their suits for this year.
They have definitely turned down
I the Hawaiian offer, and they don't
j expect any bowl offer this season.
