# Scout Workshop Needs More Help
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that some
Stanford women arc supervising the
Girl Scout Christmas Workshop,
more are needed for the meetings on
Dec. 1 and 8 between 10 and 12
a.m., states Miss Marion Johnson,
field secretary for the Girl Scouts.
Anyone interested in participating
should call Miss Johnson at Falo
Alto 615)1 for further information.
Besides making Christmas pres
ents and cards for themselves, the
Scouts arp working to fill a quota
of tray favors and tree ornaments
for the patients at Dibble Hospital.
Jo Glasson, Nellie Phillips, Mari
lyn Sidwell, and Betty Wellington
arc now helping as supervisors.
