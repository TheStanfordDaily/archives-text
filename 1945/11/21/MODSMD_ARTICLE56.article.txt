# Basketball Squad to Lead Farm Conference Return
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Stanford will have an official Pacific Coast Conference basketball
schedule this season, it was announced by Al Masters yesterday.
Returning to league competition for the first time in three years, the
Indian hoop squad will face U.C., U.S.C., and U.C.L.A. during the months
of January and February after playing several tune-up games.
Coach Dean and Mr. Masters will attend a meeting of conference mem
bers this Saturday and will return with the official schedule. Non-confer
ence games have been scheduled as follows: MofTett Field, Nov. 29; San
Jose State, Dec. 1 and 18; and a double-header at Reno, Nevada, Dec. 28
and 29.
The appointment of Forest "Fordy" Anderson as assistant coach to
Dean has also been made oilicial.
Meanwhile, the '45-'46 version of the Big Rod Basketball Machine
shifted into high gear last Monday against the San Francisco Marines. The
locals might have surprised a number of fans with their smooth team play
and good shooting. It was good early-season form considering that Coach
Dean had no truly experienced men to send out on the floor.

The starting five of Cbillson,
Hill, King, Rodman and Christian
son worked well with each other
and soon piled up a big working
margin. The Marines were not
set-ups cither. They gave Cal a
fairly tough game, coming back
in the second half to give the
Bears a light. But the California
team coasted in bv nine points, the
same margin that the Indians took
to the showers with them. The
absence of the regulars during the
waning moments of the game no
doubt influenced the final score.
The effective medium long shots,
particularly by Chillson, who hit
beautifully from forty feet, had the
Marine defense befuddled for over
half the game. After taking a 15 to
1 lead, Stanford never had any wor
ry as to the outcome of the contest.
The last half did not go as smooth
ly as the first for the home team.
The fast break which is a major part
of the Dean system failed to function
in the quick, snappy way that is
necessary. Work on this phase of
the offense will take up a majority
of the time in practice sessions in
the future.
But the other departments were
all handled well. Particularly no
ticeable was the ability of the Cards
to control the backboard. The Ma
rines had three men over six feet
two inches in key positions, but the
aggressiveness and scrappiness of
such men as Christianson, King, O'-
Brien, and Rodman overcame what
should have been a definite Marine
advantage.
The general consensus of opin
ion was. that the team looked bet
ter than expected. It played an
effective and ellicient game. Ex
cept for some hot shooting bv Gil
bert who had an unstoppable hook
shot, the Indian defense stifled the
Marine offense all night. "Any
time another team is held under
thirty points, I'll be happy," said
Coach Dean.
As far as individual performances
qo, the top five and O'Brien all rate
praise. Chillson was good on shoot
ing and stole the ball many times
from careless Marines. Rodman,
who broke in after recovering from
an early-season ankle sprain, made
a nice start. He rang up 8 points to
lead the Indian scorers, most of them
on left-handed pushes, and cleared
the backboards nicely.
King and O'Brien, who arc still
fighting it out for the pivot post,
showed to advantage. King took
more than his share of rebounds and
passed accurately while O'Brien's
ball-handling shone.
Bill Christianson, who was cap
tain of the team for the night,
played a steady game throughout
and sparkled on defense. Hill was
a constant thorn in the Marine of
fensive pattern, breaking up many
plays.
The Junior Varsity in its win over
Dibble Hospital in the preliminary
game also showed definite improve
ment. The starting lineup of Fox,
Wood, Lefcourt, Lamb and Ehrlich
and Luke Pitts, who went in soon
after the opening whistle, functioned
nicely.
Pitts sank several shots from out
side to lead in the point column be
sides holding the J.V. defense to
gether. Ehrlich also displayed some
shooting ability.

necessary. Work on this phase of
the offense will take up a majority
of the time in practice sessions in
the future.
But the other departments were
all handled well. Particularly no
ticeable was the ability of the Cards
to control the backboard. The Ma
rines had three men over six feet
two inches in key positions, but the
aggressiveness and scrappiness of
such men as Christianson, King, O'-
Brien, and Rodman overcame what
should have been a definite Marine
advantage.
The general consensus of opin
ion was. that the team looked bet
ter than expected. It played an
effective and ellicient game. Ex
cept for some hot shooting bv Gil
bert who had an unstoppable hook
shot, the Indian defense stifled the
Marine offense all night. "Any
time another team is held under
thirty points, I'll be happy," said
Coach Dean.
As far as individual performances
qo, the top five and O'Brien all rate
praise. Chillson was good on shoot
ing and stole the ball many times
from careless Marines. Rodman,
who broke in after recovering from
an early-season ankle sprain, made
a nice start. He rang up 8 points to
lead the Indian scorers, most of them
on left-handed pushes, and cleared
the backboards nicely.
King and O'Brien, who arc still
fighting it out for the pivot post,
showed to advantage. King took
more than his share of rebounds and
passed accurately while O'Brien's
ball-handling shone.
Bill Christianson, who was cap
tain of the team for the night,
played a steady game throughout
and sparkled on defense. Hill was
a constant thorn in the Marine of
fensive pattern, breaking up many
plays.
The Junior Varsity in its win over
Dibble Hospital in the preliminary
game also showed definite improve
ment. The starting lineup of Fox,
Wood, Lefcourt, Lamb and Ehrlich
and Luke Pitts, who went in soon
after the opening whistle, functioned
nicely.
Pitts sank several shots from out
side to lead in the point column be
sides holding the J.V. defense to
gether. Ehrlich also displayed some
shooting ability.
Stanford will have an official Pacific Coast Conference basketball
schedule this season, it was announced by Al Masters yesterday.
Returning to league competition for the first time in three years, the
Indian hoop squad will face U.C., U.S.C., and U.C.L.A. during the months
of January and February after playing several tune-up games.
Coach Dean and Mr. Masters will attend a meeting of conference mem
bers this Saturday and will return with the official schedule. Non-confer
ence games have been scheduled as follows: MofTett Field, Nov. 29; San
Jose State, Dec. 1 and 18; and a double-header at Reno, Nevada, Dec. 28
and 29.
The appointment of Forest "Fordy" Anderson as assistant coach to
Dean has also been made oilicial.
Meanwhile, the '45-'46 version of the Big Rod Basketball Machine
shifted into high gear last Monday against the San Francisco Marines. The
locals might have surprised a number of fans with their smooth team play
and good shooting. It was good early-season form considering that Coach
Dean had no truly experienced men to send out on the floor.

The starting five of Cbillson,
Hill, King, Rodman and Christian
son worked well with each other
and soon piled up a big working
margin. The Marines were not
set-ups cither. They gave Cal a
fairly tough game, coming back
in the second half to give the
Bears a light. But the California
team coasted in bv nine points, the
same margin that the Indians took
to the showers with them. The
absence of the regulars during the
waning moments of the game no
doubt influenced the final score.
The effective medium long shots,
particularly by Chillson, who hit
beautifully from forty feet, had the
Marine defense befuddled for over
half the game. After taking a 15 to
1 lead, Stanford never had any wor
ry as to the outcome of the contest.
The last half did not go as smooth
ly as the first for the home team.
The fast break which is a major part
of the Dean system failed to function
in the quick, snappy way that is
necessary. Work on this phase of
the offense will take up a majority
of the time in practice sessions in
the future.
