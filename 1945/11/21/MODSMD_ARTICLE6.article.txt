# Farm Thanksgiving – Fun, Food—Study
## 
### 
As one professor remarked to a
class recently, "Thanksgiving is a
time for play—but don't forget to
catch up on your studies."
Stanford students, a majority of
whom will be making the trek home
for four days of vacation either to
day or tomorrow, can be counted on
to follow the professor's advice—in
one way or another.
Stay-At-Campus Group
Thanksgiving plans for the stay
at-campus group include large tur
key dinners at Encina and Ruble to
morrow afternoon at 2. Really lucky,
they will have a good chance to
spend leisure time roaming around
the campus and absorbing Stanford
atmosphere.
One note to these people—the
Women's Gym has announced that
there will be no gym classes after
noon today. All of which probably
means they have decided to cancel
classes for the rest of the week, too.
And now is their chance to make up
the gym class they cut those times
when a picnic in the hills looked
just too enticing.
"Kill ihe Turkey"
But while cries of "Kill the fatted
Turkey," are ringing out in not-too

distant homes, let's take a look at a
cross-section of Stanford student
hood, and see what activities will
fill up their time while spending
four blissful days away from school.
For those living around the Bay
area, there is the Cal-UCLA game
this Saturday, followed by Cal's
annual homecoming dance. Always
a big event, Cal might even pull
some ardent Stanfordites away from
home territory long enough to enjoy
the fun.
Holiday Football
Down in L.A., also in the line of
football, is the Oregon State-USC
game. And if that doesn't have
enough sparkle, there's always the
alternative of bringing along a port
able radio and tuning in on the
Ohio State-Michigan tilt.
But the average vacationer will
probably spend the time soaking up
California sunshine (?), eating quan
tities of roast turkey, cranberry
sauce, mashed potatoes, and gravy.
There will be much to be thankful
for this year, including a brief res
pite from pressure of studies.
And don't forget. Dead week starts
a week from Saturday. Have a good
vacation!
