# Who Will West Send to Bowl?

and they were still considered to be
the most potent of coast teams. They
got by defenseless C.O.P. without a
scratch, and then what happened?
They made a trip to Seattle, only to
be rudely welcomed with a defeat
from the previously obscure Huskies
of the University of Washington.
They came back to beat Cal. and
then lost to St. Mary's, an expected
defeat, but not by the score the game
ended, 26-0.
Washington had suddenly project
ed themselves into the leading spot
for the Rose Bowl nomination by
virtue of their beating U.S.C. But
in this year of multi-upsets, Wash
ington lost their second game, thus
knocking themselves out of the Rose
Bowl contention, and putting U.S.C.
back in the driver's seat.
That's the way matters stood till
last Saturday. St. Mary's made
their second jaunt to the Los An
geles Coliseum and much to ev
eryone's surprise, including their
own, they lost the game to the
well-coached team of Bert La
Brucheric at L'.C.L.A. The Bruin
status wasn't improved any as far
as the conference was concerned,
and that's what pays off in the
long run, but they emerged in
everybody's mind as the best foot
ball team on the coast, barring—
of course —several of the service
teams. And the funny thing is that
the Uclans weren't cxpected to be
worth a fraction of a mil after they
lost Cal Rossi, the sensational
ground-gainer, to the Navy. The
team, however, clicked beautifully
without Rossi in the baekficld,
and won the game from the
beardless lads of Moraga in the
last minute of play.

Who's going to play in the Rose Bowl this season? At the moment that
question has everyone from Puget Sound to San Diogo Bay stumped. At
the opening of the Rrid season, those who didn't pick U.S.C. to uo to the
Pasadena Tournament of Roses were shoved ofl to an asylum. That was
the team to beat. With veterans like Jim Callanan, Harry McKinney, Clark
Higgins, and Bobby Morris around the club, the Trojans were expected to
roll through the season in fine fettle, and end up in the Bowl, thus tying
Stanford's record of three consecutive junkets to the Southern California
stadium.
In their first game they dropped U.C.L.A., and later beat Cal, although
not looking very impressive in that win. In fact, they probably won from
the Golden Bear more because of the opponents' inability to score than
because of sheer offensive power on their side.
Then came a mild (and pleasant) surprise to this department. The San
Diego Naval Training Station drubbed the mighty Trojan 33-6. That whs
their first loss in two years, but still their Rose Bowl chances weren't
dimmed very much, because the Navy game was a non-conference contest,
and they were still considered to be
the most potent of coast teams. They

because of sheer offensive power on their side.
Then came a mild (and pleasant) surprise to this department. The San
Diego Naval Training Station drubbed the mighty Trojan 33-6. That whs
their first loss in two years, but still their Rose Bowl chances weren't
dimmed very much, because the Navy game was a non-conference contest,
and they were still considered to be
the most potent of coast teams. They
got by defenseless C.O.P. without a
scratch, and then what happened?
They made a trip to Seattle, only to
be rudely welcomed with a defeat
from the previously obscure Huskies
of the University of Washington.
They came back to beat Cal. and
then lost to St. Mary's, an expected
defeat, but not by the score the game
ended, 26-0.
Washington had suddenly project
ed themselves into the leading spot
for the Rose Bowl nomination by
virtue of their beating U.S.C. But
in this year of multi-upsets, Wash
ington lost their second game, thus
knocking themselves out of the Rose
Bowl contention, and putting U.S.C.
back in the driver's seat.
That's the way matters stood till
last Saturday. St. Mary's made
their second jaunt to the Los An
geles Coliseum and much to ev
eryone's surprise, including their
own, they lost the game to the
well-coached team of Bert La
Brucheric at L'.C.L.A. The Bruin
status wasn't improved any as far
as the conference was concerned,
and that's what pays off in the
long run, but they emerged in
everybody's mind as the best foot
ball team on the coast, barring—
of course —several of the service
teams. And the funny thing is that
the Uclans weren't cxpected to be
worth a fraction of a mil after they
lost Cal Rossi, the sensational
ground-gainer, to the Navy. The
team, however, clicked beautifully
without Rossi in the baekficld,
and won the game from the
beardless lads of Moraga in the
last minute of play.

Who's going to play in the Rose Bowl this season? At the moment that
question has everyone from Puget Sound to San Diogo Bay stumped. At
the opening of the Rrid season, those who didn't pick U.S.C. to uo to the
Pasadena Tournament of Roses were shoved ofl to an asylum. That was
the team to beat. With veterans like Jim Callanan, Harry McKinney, Clark
Higgins, and Bobby Morris around the club, the Trojans were expected to
roll through the season in fine fettle, and end up in the Bowl, thus tying
Stanford's record of three consecutive junkets to the Southern California
stadium.
In their first game they dropped U.C.L.A., and later beat Cal, although
not looking very impressive in that win. In fact, they probably won from
the Golden Bear more because of the opponents' inability to score than
because of sheer offensive power on their side.
