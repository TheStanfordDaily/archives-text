# Liberal Arts Plan Proposed
## 
### 
Members of the Academic Coun
cil of Stanford University have re
ceived from the Consulting Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies a
proposal for a revised liberal arts
program which the authors believe
"retains the benefits of the elective
system without allowing it to be
come anarchic."
This proposal, committee mem
bers said, also "retains for the
schools and departments their pres
ent freedom to determine what is
best for their majors" while at the
same time providing every Stanford
student with "an adequate liberal
education."
To Be Submitted
Authors of the proposal are Pro
fessors Philip VV. Buck, Raymond D.
Harriman, John L. Mothershead, Jr.,
and Willis Johnson, who served as
acting chairman. The proposal was
transmitted to the faculty "for dis
cussion and consideration" leading
to a final version to be submitted to
the Academic Council for legislative
action.
In a covering letter, President
Donald B. Trcsidder emphasized
that this is a preliminary report, and
stated that it had already been re
viewed by the Executive Commit
tee, the Advisory Board, and the
Deans, who had agreed upon a pro
cedure for consideration of the pro
posal.
('onsiilting Committee
This involves having the faculty
of each school meet with a member
of the Consulting Committee for dis
cussion of the recommendations. Af
ter all of thp meetings have been
held, the Consulting Committee will
revise the report, taking into con
sideration the suggestions made by
the faculty. In revised form the re
port will be submitted later to the
Executive Committee and the Aca
demic Council as a whole.
A similar review of graduate stud
ies will be made later, President
Tresidder said.
In their report members of the

Consulting Committee expressed
eoncedn that pre-professional train
ing during undergraduate years is
tending to take more and more of
tlie student's time, and "in some
cases this tendency has gone so far
that the purpose of undergraduate
study. has come to be regarded as
pre-professional training and not as
tho provision of a liberal education."
"The Committee feels strongly,"
the report states, "'that it is desir
able, wherever possible, for pie
professional students to obtain the
advantages of a liberal education."
The report adds that fortunately all
present requirements "can be met
within the framework of the pro
posed liberal arts program, with the
exception of those of the School of
Engineering."
No Re learning
It is believed, however, that re
quired liberal arts courses "should
never force a student to relearn ma
terial he already knows," the report
.states. The proposal would elimi
nate this possibility by establishing
"optional achievement tests which,
if passed, would release students
from the obligation of taking re
quired courses."
Every student who receives the
A.B. degree, according to the Com
mittee, "should demonstrate a cer
tain competence in the following: (1)
English, (2) Speech, (3) Mathemat
ics, (4) History, (5) Natural Sciences
(primary and secondary), (6) For
eign Language, (7) Social Sciences,
(8) a selected treatise intensively
studied, (9) Literature, (10) Fine
Arts, (11) Philosophy."
Outlined in Detail
Ways in which it is believed such
competence could be demonstrated
—or attained- are outlined in de
tail in the report.
Among other things, the Commit
tee proposes introductory courses
which would be designed both for
students who expected to continue
in that particular field and also those
who merely wanted a survey course.
Upper Division Requirements
Certain requirements would also i
be applied to Upper Division work.
In these cases there would be no
achievement tests, but there would
be sufficient alternatives "so that no
repetition of subject matter would
be involved."
The Committee also would require '
I physical training but docs not feel i
"competent to judge the extent and
character of this training." It is j
recommended, however, "that nei
ther academic units nor academic !
grades be given for this require-
ment."
Maximum Units !)!)
A bilingual freshman, if he pos- ,
i sessed all possible achievement tests j
upon entering the University, might
have as few as 27 required units un
der this proposal. On the other
hand, the maximum number of re- ]
quired units would lie 99. The Com
j mittcc believes, however, that most
; students would be subject to be
j tween 75 and 85 required units.

proposal for a revised liberal arts
program which the authors believe
"retains the benefits of the elective
system without allowing it to be
come anarchic."
This proposal, committee mem
bers said, also "retains for the
schools and departments their pres
ent freedom to determine what is
best for their majors" while at the
same time providing every Stanford
student with "an adequate liberal
education."
To Be Submitted
Authors of the proposal are Pro
fessors Philip VV. Buck, Raymond D.
Harriman, John L. Mothershead, Jr.,
and Willis Johnson, who served as
acting chairman. The proposal was
transmitted to the faculty "for dis
cussion and consideration" leading
to a final version to be submitted to
the Academic Council for legislative
action.
In a covering letter, President
Donald B. Trcsidder emphasized
that this is a preliminary report, and
stated that it had already been re
viewed by the Executive Commit
tee, the Advisory Board, and the
Deans, who had agreed upon a pro
cedure for consideration of the pro
posal.

This involves having the faculty
of each school meet with a member
of the Consulting Committee for dis
cussion of the recommendations. Af
ter all of thp meetings have been
held, the Consulting Committee will
revise the report, taking into con
sideration the suggestions made by
the faculty. In revised form the re
port will be submitted later to the
Executive Committee and the Aca
demic Council as a whole.
A similar review of graduate stud
ies will be made later, President
Tresidder said.
In their report members of the

Consulting Committee expressed
eoncedn that pre-professional train
ing during undergraduate years is
tending to take more and more of
tlie student's time, and "in some
cases this tendency has gone so far
that the purpose of undergraduate
study. has come to be regarded as
pre-professional training and not as
tho provision of a liberal education."
"The Committee feels strongly,"
the report states, "'that it is desir
able, wherever possible, for pie
professional students to obtain the
advantages of a liberal education."
The report adds that fortunately all
present requirements "can be met
within the framework of the pro
posed liberal arts program, with the
exception of those of the School of
Engineering."
No Re learning
It is believed, however, that re
quired liberal arts courses "should
never force a student to relearn ma
terial he already knows," the report
.states. The proposal would elimi
nate this possibility by establishing
"optional achievement tests which,
if passed, would release students
from the obligation of taking re
quired courses."
Every student who receives the
A.B. degree, according to the Com
mittee, "should demonstrate a cer
tain competence in the following: (1)
English, (2) Speech, (3) Mathemat
ics, (4) History, (5) Natural Sciences
(primary and secondary), (6) For
eign Language, (7) Social Sciences,
(8) a selected treatise intensively
studied, (9) Literature, (10) Fine
Arts, (11) Philosophy."
Outlined in Detail
Ways in which it is believed such
competence could be demonstrated
—or attained- are outlined in de
tail in the report.
Among other things, the Commit
tee proposes introductory courses
which would be designed both for
students who expected to continue
in that particular field and also those
who merely wanted a survey course.
Upper Division Requirements
Certain requirements would also i
be applied to Upper Division work.
In these cases there would be no
achievement tests, but there would
be sufficient alternatives "so that no
repetition of subject matter would
be involved."
The Committee also would require '
I physical training but docs not feel i
"competent to judge the extent and
character of this training." It is j
recommended, however, "that nei
ther academic units nor academic !
grades be given for this require-
ment."

A bilingual freshman, if he pos- ,
i sessed all possible achievement tests j
upon entering the University, might
have as few as 27 required units un
der this proposal. On the other
hand, the maximum number of re- ]
quired units would lie 99. The Com
j mittcc believes, however, that most
; students would be subject to be
j tween 75 and 85 required units.

come anarchic."
This proposal, committee mem
bers said, also "retains for the
schools and departments their pres
ent freedom to determine what is
best for their majors" while at the
same time providing every Stanford
student with "an adequate liberal
education."
To Be Submitted
Authors of the proposal are Pro
fessors Philip VV. Buck, Raymond D.
Harriman, John L. Mothershead, Jr.,
and Willis Johnson, who served as
acting chairman. The proposal was
transmitted to the faculty "for dis
cussion and consideration" leading
to a final version to be submitted to
the Academic Council for legislative
action.
In a covering letter, President
Donald B. Trcsidder emphasized
that this is a preliminary report, and
stated that it had already been re
viewed by the Executive Commit
tee, the Advisory Board, and the
Deans, who had agreed upon a pro
cedure for consideration of the pro
posal.
('onsiilting Committee
This involves having the faculty
of each school meet with a member
of the Consulting Committee for dis
cussion of the recommendations. Af
ter all of thp meetings have been
held, the Consulting Committee will
revise the report, taking into con
sideration the suggestions made by
the faculty. In revised form the re
port will be submitted later to the
Executive Committee and the Aca
demic Council as a whole.
A similar review of graduate stud
ies will be made later, President
Tresidder said.
In their report members of the

Consulting Committee expressed
eoncedn that pre-professional train
ing during undergraduate years is
tending to take more and more of
tlie student's time, and "in some
cases this tendency has gone so far
that the purpose of undergraduate
study. has come to be regarded as
pre-professional training and not as
tho provision of a liberal education."
"The Committee feels strongly,"
the report states, "'that it is desir
able, wherever possible, for pie
professional students to obtain the
advantages of a liberal education."
The report adds that fortunately all
present requirements "can be met
within the framework of the pro
posed liberal arts program, with the
exception of those of the School of
Engineering."
No Re learning
It is believed, however, that re
quired liberal arts courses "should
never force a student to relearn ma
terial he already knows," the report
.states. The proposal would elimi
nate this possibility by establishing
"optional achievement tests which,
if passed, would release students
from the obligation of taking re
quired courses."
Every student who receives the
A.B. degree, according to the Com
mittee, "should demonstrate a cer
tain competence in the following: (1)
English, (2) Speech, (3) Mathemat
ics, (4) History, (5) Natural Sciences
(primary and secondary), (6) For
eign Language, (7) Social Sciences,
(8) a selected treatise intensively
studied, (9) Literature, (10) Fine
Arts, (11) Philosophy."
Outlined in Detail
Ways in which it is believed such
competence could be demonstrated
—or attained- are outlined in de
tail in the report.
Among other things, the Commit
tee proposes introductory courses
which would be designed both for
students who expected to continue
in that particular field and also those
who merely wanted a survey course.
Upper Division Requirements
Certain requirements would also i
be applied to Upper Division work.
In these cases there would be no
achievement tests, but there would
be sufficient alternatives "so that no
repetition of subject matter would
be involved."
The Committee also would require '
I physical training but docs not feel i
"competent to judge the extent and
character of this training." It is j
recommended, however, "that nei
ther academic units nor academic !
grades be given for this require-
ment."
Maximum Units !)!)
A bilingual freshman, if he pos- ,
i sessed all possible achievement tests j
upon entering the University, might
have as few as 27 required units un
der this proposal. On the other
hand, the maximum number of re- ]
quired units would lie 99. The Com
j mittcc believes, however, that most
; students would be subject to be
j tween 75 and 85 required units.
