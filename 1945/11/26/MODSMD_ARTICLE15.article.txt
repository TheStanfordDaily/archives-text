# Holiday's Hangover --

Nyah — so you went home for
Thanksgiving! So you dropped ev
erything and ran home to turkeys
and cranberries and things and
things and things in the evenings?
Now you're back. Look at the
.spoils term papers and 1,000-page
textbooks, with just 800 more pages
to be read. And you're all shot for
this week. If you're lucky, you'll
spend your afternoons at the Health
Service. If not, you'll spend all day
at the Rest Home.
Have you had enough, or do you
still say thai you're glad you cut
classes loyally for four days? Well,
next week is dead week. And you'll
be so dead (hat you won't realize
that the following week will be
finals. Then you can go home for
a nice 1-o-o-o-ng vacation.
Was it worth it? Encina would
have served you on Thanksgiving
Day. Then you could have spent the
afternoon reading the libe's best.
They let books no out Wednesday
afternoon, and you didn't have to
them back until 0 o'clock Fri
day morning. Bargain day but you
wanted turkey.
So, all we'll do is chuckle, "Glad
you're back—tough you can't live
longer." (Was the dark meat Rood?)
