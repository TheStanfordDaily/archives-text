"THERE MUST BE A PLACE"
Stanford women have recently devoted much* of their con
versation-time to a problem common to every woman from the
top of the Row to the farthest casa in Lagunita: Can residences
be left open until lock-out time on Friday and Saturday nights,
and if not, is there another place on campus which would satis
fy the admitted need for "a place to go" after dances and shows
and the closing hour at Dinah's?
What seemed like the ideal solution and the best substitute
for "home" in the University environment was having indi
vidual halls slay open, so that women living in them could spend
the evening's last hour or two relaxing and talking with their
dates in the warmth and safety of residence living and social
rooms.
In answer to the enthusiastic approval of women who were
informed of this suggestion, three reasons were given why the
halls could not stay open. First, it would keep house mothers
up until 1:30 on Saturday nights, which is at present unnecessary
under the key system used by Row houses. Second, it would
keep resident assistants up, and third, women living in the
residences would be disturbed by the noise of the visitors. These
three reasons it would seem, constitute "infringement of the
rights of others."
Far from advocating such infringement, we nevertheless feel
that those persons concerned —the three categories named above
- should be acguainted with the relative advantages and incon
veniences of the plan. Week-end nights are rarely noted for
peace-and-quiet in any woman's residence anyway; the reac
tion of all women with whom we have talked has been enthusi
astically in the affirmative. In such halls as Lagunita, Roble,
Union, and Branner, night matrons are already up until midnight
and 1:30 with the duties imposed by the lock-out system. Per
haps the house mothers and R.A.'s of other residences would
be willing to stay up until 1:30 one night per week in the inter
ests of healthy and home-like social regulations.
The alternative to the houses staying open seems to resolve
itself into the Nitery. Through the combined efforts of a large
proportion of the women, the Nitery might be transformed from
its present barren and unattractive appearance into a place
v/here students would go of their own volition to spend the
tog-end of an evening. But there would always be the liability
of assigning hostesses from each living group to chaperone
and perhaps sell refreshments, plus the continuous expense of
upkeep and the necessary sales and bazaars to fulfill them.
Unless this alternative is acceptable, and women are willing
to try once more to hurdle the obstacle of a stubbornly unat
tractive Nitery, v/e hope further consideration can be given the
suggestion for later hours for the coed's "home-away-kom
homs."—B.M.V.
