You were probably too busy last Wednesday, packing and
catching trains, to pay much attention to that morning's Daily.
It'll be worth your time to dig that old paper up, and look for
an article on page three—'he article on Stanford's building plan.
The headline, all about new, modern living groups being
constructed for use in the fall, sounds good. The first part of
the article sounds good too —new living units for several hun
dred older students and similar apartments for married couples.
You're happy, because it sounds as though Stanford again is
settling down to its original status as a residence university, and
because the administration has finally made definite committ
ments. This means providing living space on campus for fresh
men and other students, who have been forced to live in private
homes and commute daily frcm Menlo Park, Redwood City, and
even as far as San Jose. Once more Stanford will be a small,
compact family-—but here a few questions arise.
You realize that you could be interpreting these plans en
tirely wrong, when you near the end of the article. You get a
sort of Cal-sick feeling when you read:
"As soon as proposed living-groups are completed, and other
less difficult features brought into alignment, the student body
can be expanded to 5,000 or 6,000, or a 50 percent increase in
enrollment."
So that's it! Are we running a race, using as our policy, "the
bigger the school, the better" Was that why Stanford had
its old-time quota system —just because it didn't have enough
Lousing space to accommodate anyone willing to pay the tui
tion fees? We always thought that something else was involved
- something about spirit, honor, and standards that may not
operate on too large a scale— but maybe we're just old fashioned
Or had the wrong idea.
What about scholastic standards? They certainly should be
of good, solid concern to the administration. Would the 50 per
cent increase in enrollment mean the lowering of scholastic
standards? Would this be a necessary step in order to enroll
C,OCJO students in normal times—unless, of course, the tuition
were cut drastically, which hardly seems possible, considering
the expense of the proposed building.
The fact that at the present time admission of freshman wom
en is being very greatly curtailed, because of a lack of housing
accommodations, is hardly a factor in this issue. This necessity
of turning away numerous women who would have been ac
cepted in pre-war years is the natural result of the University's
increasing of quotas for women during the war years. It's not
a normal situation, and permanent plans for a normal Stanford
should not be built around it. This condition will work itself
out with the graduation of the larger classes.
The main objection, though, is that this is Stanford—not
Cornell, Cal, nor any other large, impersonal university. And
furthermore, we'd like to see it stay Stanford.

"As soon as proposed living-groups are completed, and other
less difficult features brought into alignment, the student body
can be expanded to 5,000 or 6,000, or a 50 percent increase in
enrollment."
So that's it! Are we running a race, using as our policy, "the
bigger the school, the better" Was that why Stanford had
its old-time quota system —just because it didn't have enough
Lousing space to accommodate anyone willing to pay the tui
tion fees? We always thought that something else was involved
- something about spirit, honor, and standards that may not
operate on too large a scale— but maybe we're just old fashioned
Or had the wrong idea.
What about scholastic standards? They certainly should be
of good, solid concern to the administration. Would the 50 per
cent increase in enrollment mean the lowering of scholastic
standards? Would this be a necessary step in order to enroll
C,OCJO students in normal times—unless, of course, the tuition
were cut drastically, which hardly seems possible, considering
the expense of the proposed building.
The fact that at the present time admission of freshman wom
en is being very greatly curtailed, because of a lack of housing
accommodations, is hardly a factor in this issue. This necessity
of turning away numerous women who would have been ac
cepted in pre-war years is the natural result of the University's
increasing of quotas for women during the war years. It's not
a normal situation, and permanent plans for a normal Stanford
should not be built around it. This condition will work itself
out with the graduation of the larger classes.
The main objection, though, is that this is Stanford—not
Cornell, Cal, nor any other large, impersonal university. And
furthermore, we'd like to see it stay Stanford.
You were probably too busy last Wednesday, packing and
catching trains, to pay much attention to that morning's Daily.
It'll be worth your time to dig that old paper up, and look for
an article on page three—'he article on Stanford's building plan.
The headline, all about new, modern living groups being
constructed for use in the fall, sounds good. The first part of
the article sounds good too —new living units for several hun
dred older students and similar apartments for married couples.
You're happy, because it sounds as though Stanford again is
settling down to its original status as a residence university, and
because the administration has finally made definite committ
ments. This means providing living space on campus for fresh
men and other students, who have been forced to live in private
homes and commute daily frcm Menlo Park, Redwood City, and
even as far as San Jose. Once more Stanford will be a small,
compact family-—but here a few questions arise.
You realize that you could be interpreting these plans en
tirely wrong, when you near the end of the article. You get a
sort of Cal-sick feeling when you read:
