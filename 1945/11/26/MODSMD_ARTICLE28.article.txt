# On the Discs
## 
### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
This week there seems to be a
dearth of good music on record. The
only discs actually worth your at
tention and money are the five plat
ters released by Capitol in the third
volume of their History of Jazz al
bums. This album contains some of
the best music that these ears have
heard in quite a number of bars, and
yet more of "note" than the music is
the appearance of some of the great
est instrumentalists of our era. The
records are grouped under a title,
"Then Came Swing," and once again
produce more of the "real jazz" than
history, which so far has proved to
be all right with the public.
Rex Stewart and his Big Eight
kick the whole "bash" off with two
originals that contain great solo and
ensemble work by Lawrence Brown,
Harry Carney, A 1 Sears, Keg Bur
nell, and the "Begin the Beguine"
man, Eddie Heywood, performing
under a pseudonym "Eddie Wood."
A 1 Casey, Esquire Gold Award
winner, and Big Syd Catlett, also ac
corded the same honor, lead two of
the other combos through some scin
tillating sets. Featured on these
sides are most of the notable musi
cians who were in Los Angeles at
the time these cutting sessions took
place. There is some great work by
the Benny Carter sideman, Bumps
Myers, and by the Harry James alto
man, Willie Smith. In rifling support
one will find the trumpets of Joe
Guy, Billie Holiday's husband, and
Gerald Wilson, former lead trumpet
with Jimmy Lunceford, very much
in evidence.
We now arrive at the "meat" of
the entire album. The group is
named the International Jazzmen
and is so star-laden that it reads like
a Who's Who in Swingdom. Nat
"King" Cole, Bill Coleman, Oscar
More, John Kirby, Coleman Haw
kins, Benny Carter, Buster Bailey,
and Max Roach are the musicians
that back Kay Starr on a nice vocal,
although one chorus for her would
have been enough considering the
soloists on the date, and jump their
way through a rocking riff tune by
Mr. Carter. If this music is history,
then by all means let us turn the
clock back!
Sammy Saccharine
A new addition to the platter pa
rade is the Sammy Kaye disc, "It
Might as Well Be Spring" and "Give
Me the Simple Life." Billy Williams
takes the vocal spotlight on the first
side, and perhaps he should have
left it where it was. Although Wil
liams is making solo records now,
this effort is really an effort, and it
does not add anything to the fine
song that he is featured on. He has
a nice quality to his voice, but the
expression and feeling are lacking,
and you receive the impression that
he is singing in a monotone.
Also used or misused on this side
is a Hawaiian, steel guitar. Tricks
already! On the reverse, "Give Me
the Simple Life," the vocalist, as
Kaye breaks into the middle of the
record to tell you, is Betty Barclay,
"our little 8.8. girl." Somehow as
you listen to the record, you wish
someone would give it to her (the
simple life, we mean) and let it go
at that.
Mutton Happenings
When you hear the scream, the
time will probably be when Betty
Hutton's latest record is released.
Shouting and yelling her way
through two more sid'js, Miss Hut
ton's newest offerings are "Doctor,
Lawyer, Indian Chief" and "A
Square in the Social Circle." On
the first side the "blonde bombshell"
i.s accompanied by a "vocal quartet"
who contribute everything from
harmony to off-beat clapping to the
record, and Betty tops the whole af
fair off with a couple of war whoops.
The tune was written by Hoagy (I
sing through my nose, but I wrote
"Stardust") Carmichael, and it pro
gresses along very nicely imtil the
"incendiary peroxide" abandons her
voice for acrobatics.
Upon turning the record over we
find another typical Hutton noise
maker, "A Square in the Social Cir
cle," which is a very cleverly writ
ten ditty with little else to recom
mend it. It seems a shame that a
young lady with such talent should
literally burn herself out singing
these songs. She has a great voice,
as shown by the recording of "It
Had to Be You," and she should be
given more chance to demonstrate
her vocal ability and leave the
clowning to Cass Daley and Judy
Canova.
Digging Dorscv
Once again Tommy Dorsoy comes
through with a below-average disc.
The record this time consists of two
jump sides which are tight through
out, and in many ways fall way off
the old Dorsey standard. Although
far more listenable than any of his
recent performances, this platter,
"Chloe" and "At the Fat Man's," is
only more proof that when jazzmen
are not "at home" and relaxed, good
music is sacrificed. With Buddy
Rich very much in prominence, "The
Song of the Swamp" is simple brass
and sax unison with some Buddy De
Franco clarinet towards the end.
On whirling (he other side, we find
â™¦he former John Kirby sideman,
Charlie Shavers taking both Ihe vo
cal and trumpet spotlight. With an
awful strain on his larynx, Charlie
manages to get by the vocal chorus
and proceeds to the horn solo. This
solo is so reminiscent of the scream
ing Eldiidge style that it was only
the label that cleared up our dilem
ma. Even the Sy Oliver arrange
ment doesn't help the side even
though there is a nice brass figure
.11 the end of the last chorus.
