# Stuart to Go To Morocco
## 
### 
Graham Stuart, professor of po
litical science and expert on inter
national affairs, will leave December
8 for Tangier to serve as adviser to
U.S. Consul General Paul Ailing in
drafting the United States version
of a new international statute for
that Moroccan city.
Mr. Stuart wrote "The Interna
tional City of Tangier" about ten
years ago, the only book written in
English about Tangier. Pie plans to
be away from two to three months,
he will fly to Washington, D.C., and
then proceed via Army transport to
Tangier by way of the Azores and
Casablanca.
Although this country has never
officially recognized Tangier as an
international zone, it has supported
its consular officers in their efforts to
obtain international control of pub
lic health and quarantine measures

there. The U.S. consular and diplo
matic corps of Tangier served as
sanitary council for the city from
1840 to 1925 when the international
statute was initiated; after 1929 the
United States took over the sole re
maining functions of the council.
It is well known that with the es
tablishment of U.S. troops in Mo
rocco and Algeria as a result of the
French failure to protect her North
African possessions during the re
cent war, there is a strong possibility
that the United States will be asked
by the sultan of Morocco to take
over Tangier as a protectorate. This
wish was expressed by a Moroccan
sultan 74 years ago, as a safeguard
against the predatory methods of
certain European powers that were
watching Morocco, and particularly
Tangier, with covetous eyes.
Tangier was an international zone
until 1940 when Franco moved in
and removed all agencies except the
international court. Now that the
Spanish regime is out as a result
of the war, it is likely that Spain
and Italy, formerly prominent in the
international control of the city, will
be relegated to minor functions.
