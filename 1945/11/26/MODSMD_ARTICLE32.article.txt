# Lewis M. Terman Will Publish His Study of 1,400 Geniuses
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
Lewis M. Terman, professor of
psychology, emeritus, will publish
a book within the year giving the
account of a 25-year study of about
1400 gifted children between the
ages of 3 and 18 and their later de
velopment.
He began his study in 1921 and
1922. The greatest number of chil
dren were between the ages of 5
and 13, with the average, 10. The
majority of those over (5 were in
school and were at the top of their
grades.
High IQ's
All the children had intelligence
quotients obtained by fewer than
one in 100 persons. They were
picked from all types of home en
vironments, although their average
environment was better than the
average of the country.
Within a year of selecting the
children, Mr. Terman and his help
ers collected data on each child. The
data came from school achievement
tests, medical examinations, per
sonality tests, and 37 physical meas
urpments. Case history data were
also collected from parents and
school teachers, and the children
were given a battery of interest,
character, and personality tests.
Group Tested
The children were followed an
nually for a while by parent and
teacher report blanks. Then in 1927
and 1928, field workers retested
them. In 193(5 and 1937, 90 per cent
of the original group were located,
and in 1939 and 1940, 98 per cent.
Field workers gave intelligence
tests, social adjustment tests, the
Strong Vocational Interest test, and
marital happiness tests to those who
were married. In 1945, Mi - . Terman
and his staff kept in contact with
most of them by mail.
Average Age 35
"The total group is now at an av
erage age of 35, Mr. Terman said,
"although the age range is from
about 25 to 44. We have pretty
complete records on them, and have
found that the mortality rate of this
group is below normal and that the
health records are good and in many
cases superior."
Eighty per cent of the group are
married and have stayed married
better than the general population,
according to Mr. Terman. Their de
linquency rate and insanity rate are
low. The average income of the
group is two or three times that of
the average worker in the country.
Positions Now
Seventy per cent of the group
have been graduated from colleges,
and two-thirds of those have taken
one or more years of graduate work.
Seventy members of the group are
on college faculties, and the same
number are lawyers and doctors.
"Many of them have become na
tionally eminent — some have ex
celled in various sciences and fields
of art, and some are writers," Mr.
Terman continued. "The group as
a whole has published 25 books,
about 1,000 scientific articles, and
has taken out about 150 patents."
Not All Successful
"However, not all of the persons
in the group have been so success
ful," Mr. Terman stressed. "How
much they achieve depends partly
on their personality traits and luck.
The intelligence tests given them in
1940 show that their intelligence has
held up very well. The average
score was far higher than that of the

'average Stanford graduate."
Mr. Terman has already published
several books on his study. Vol
ume I. which was published by the
Stanford University Press in 1925,
is entitled "Mental and Physical
Traits of 1,000 Gifted Children."
Rook in 1928
He published Volume 111, "The
Promise of Youth," in 1928. This
book contains follow-up studies of
the 1,000 children. Volume II of the
series was a parallel study made by
one of his students, Catharine Cox
Miles, now a professor at Yale Uni-

I versity. It is called "Early Mental
Development of 300 Historical Gen
iuses." The purpose of this book was
to find out the correlation of the
geniuses and Mr. Terman's group,
and the correlation was found to be
very high. The geniuses chosen
were those that materialized—they
had high IQ's and more than ordi
nary zeal, Mr. Terman said.
Mr. Terman is going to continue
to follow up his cases. Already he
and his staff have tested 400 of the
second generation—there are 1300,

but not all of them are old enough t
to test. The IQ's of the second gen
eration are much higher than aver
age. but they are not all as high as |
their parents'. They have tended to
regress a little. The spouses of the
first generation averaged an intelli
gence as high as Stanford graduates,
and many of them were superior to
the original cases.

sonality tests, and 37 physical meas
urpments. Case history data were
also collected from parents and
school teachers, and the children
were given a battery of interest,
character, and personality tests.
Group Tested
The children were followed an
nually for a while by parent and
teacher report blanks. Then in 1927
and 1928, field workers retested
them. In 193(5 and 1937, 90 per cent
of the original group were located,
and in 1939 and 1940, 98 per cent.
Field workers gave intelligence
tests, social adjustment tests, the
Strong Vocational Interest test, and
marital happiness tests to those who
were married. In 1945, Mi - . Terman
and his staff kept in contact with
most of them by mail.
Average Age 35
"The total group is now at an av
erage age of 35, Mr. Terman said,
"although the age range is from
about 25 to 44. We have pretty
complete records on them, and have
found that the mortality rate of this
group is below normal and that the
health records are good and in many
cases superior."
Eighty per cent of the group are
married and have stayed married
better than the general population,
according to Mr. Terman. Their de
linquency rate and insanity rate are
low. The average income of the
group is two or three times that of
the average worker in the country.
Positions Now
Seventy per cent of the group
have been graduated from colleges,
and two-thirds of those have taken
one or more years of graduate work.
Seventy members of the group are
on college faculties, and the same
number are lawyers and doctors.
"Many of them have become na
tionally eminent — some have ex
celled in various sciences and fields
of art, and some are writers," Mr.
Terman continued. "The group as
a whole has published 25 books,
about 1,000 scientific articles, and
has taken out about 150 patents."
Not All Successful
"However, not all of the persons
in the group have been so success
ful," Mr. Terman stressed. "How
much they achieve depends partly
on their personality traits and luck.
The intelligence tests given them in
1940 show that their intelligence has
held up very well. The average
score was far higher than that of the

'average Stanford graduate."
Mr. Terman has already published
several books on his study. Vol
ume I. which was published by the
Stanford University Press in 1925,
is entitled "Mental and Physical
Traits of 1,000 Gifted Children."
Rook in 1928
He published Volume 111, "The
Promise of Youth," in 1928. This
book contains follow-up studies of
the 1,000 children. Volume II of the
series was a parallel study made by
one of his students, Catharine Cox
Miles, now a professor at Yale Uni-

I versity. It is called "Early Mental
Development of 300 Historical Gen
iuses." The purpose of this book was
to find out the correlation of the
geniuses and Mr. Terman's group,
and the correlation was found to be
very high. The geniuses chosen
were those that materialized—they
had high IQ's and more than ordi
nary zeal, Mr. Terman said.
Mr. Terman is going to continue
to follow up his cases. Already he
and his staff have tested 400 of the
second generation—there are 1300,

but not all of them are old enough t
to test. The IQ's of the second gen
eration are much higher than aver
age. but they are not all as high as |
their parents'. They have tended to
regress a little. The spouses of the
first generation averaged an intelli
gence as high as Stanford graduates,
and many of them were superior to
the original cases.

complete records on them, and have
found that the mortality rate of this
group is below normal and that the
health records are good and in many
cases superior."
Eighty per cent of the group are
married and have stayed married
better than the general population,
according to Mr. Terman. Their de
linquency rate and insanity rate are
low. The average income of the
group is two or three times that of
the average worker in the country.
Positions Now
Seventy per cent of the group
have been graduated from colleges,
and two-thirds of those have taken
one or more years of graduate work.
Seventy members of the group are
on college faculties, and the same
number are lawyers and doctors.
"Many of them have become na
tionally eminent — some have ex
celled in various sciences and fields
of art, and some are writers," Mr.
Terman continued. "The group as
a whole has published 25 books,
about 1,000 scientific articles, and
has taken out about 150 patents."
Not All Successful
"However, not all of the persons
in the group have been so success
ful," Mr. Terman stressed. "How
much they achieve depends partly
on their personality traits and luck.
The intelligence tests given them in
1940 show that their intelligence has
held up very well. The average
score was far higher than that of the

'average Stanford graduate."
Mr. Terman has already published
several books on his study. Vol
ume I. which was published by the
Stanford University Press in 1925,
is entitled "Mental and Physical
Traits of 1,000 Gifted Children."
Rook in 1928
He published Volume 111, "The
Promise of Youth," in 1928. This
book contains follow-up studies of
the 1,000 children. Volume II of the
series was a parallel study made by
one of his students, Catharine Cox
Miles, now a professor at Yale Uni-

I versity. It is called "Early Mental
Development of 300 Historical Gen
iuses." The purpose of this book was
to find out the correlation of the
geniuses and Mr. Terman's group,
and the correlation was found to be
very high. The geniuses chosen
were those that materialized—they
had high IQ's and more than ordi
nary zeal, Mr. Terman said.
Mr. Terman is going to continue
to follow up his cases. Already he
and his staff have tested 400 of the
second generation—there are 1300,

but not all of them are old enough t
to test. The IQ's of the second gen
eration are much higher than aver
age. but they are not all as high as |
their parents'. They have tended to
regress a little. The spouses of the
first generation averaged an intelli
gence as high as Stanford graduates,
and many of them were superior to
the original cases.

LEWIS M. TERMAN
Lewis M. Terman, professor of
psychology, emeritus, will publish
a book within the year giving the
account of a 25-year study of about
1400 gifted children between the
ages of 3 and 18 and their later de
velopment.
He began his study in 1921 and
1922. The greatest number of chil
dren were between the ages of 5
and 13, with the average, 10. The
majority of those over (5 were in
school and were at the top of their
grades.
High IQ's
All the children had intelligence
quotients obtained by fewer than
one in 100 persons. They were
picked from all types of home en
vironments, although their average
environment was better than the
average of the country.
Within a year of selecting the
children, Mr. Terman and his help
ers collected data on each child. The
data came from school achievement
tests, medical examinations, per
sonality tests, and 37 physical meas
urpments. Case history data were
also collected from parents and
school teachers, and the children
were given a battery of interest,
character, and personality tests.
Group Tested
The children were followed an
nually for a while by parent and
teacher report blanks. Then in 1927
and 1928, field workers retested
them. In 193(5 and 1937, 90 per cent
of the original group were located,
and in 1939 and 1940, 98 per cent.
Field workers gave intelligence
tests, social adjustment tests, the
Strong Vocational Interest test, and
marital happiness tests to those who
were married. In 1945, Mi - . Terman
and his staff kept in contact with
most of them by mail.
Average Age 35
"The total group is now at an av
erage age of 35, Mr. Terman said,
"although the age range is from
about 25 to 44. We have pretty
complete records on them, and have
found that the mortality rate of this
group is below normal and that the
health records are good and in many
cases superior."
Eighty per cent of the group are
married and have stayed married
better than the general population,
according to Mr. Terman. Their de
linquency rate and insanity rate are
low. The average income of the
group is two or three times that of
the average worker in the country.
Positions Now
Seventy per cent of the group
have been graduated from colleges,
and two-thirds of those have taken
one or more years of graduate work.
Seventy members of the group are
