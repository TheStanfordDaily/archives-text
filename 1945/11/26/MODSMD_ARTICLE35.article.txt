First matter to be taken care of j
is a correction. Last Monday — if
anybody cares to look—this writer
said that U.S.C. might beat Stan
ford's present record of making
three consecutive trips to the Rose
Bowl on the number one day of the
new year. The Vow Boys compiled
that enviable record in '34, "35, and j
'36.
The point to be corrected is that
U.S.C. will not beat Stanford's rec
ord, but will only tie it if they go
over to Pasadena to oppose Ala
bama. They played the 1943 game
against Washington, and in '44 op
posed Tennessee. We are still hop
ing that U.S.C. doesn't go to the
bowl for purely selfish reasons.
If the Trojans do go, which looks
rather likely now .that means that
Stanford will have to win the Pa
cific Coast Conference title four
years in a row to once again es
tablish themselves as the record
holders for consecutive trips to
the llose Bowl. We're all for that,
too, but we don't like this busi
ness of seeing U.S.C. crowding
Stanford for gridiron laurels.
Another interesting note regard
ing Stanford's invasion of the big >
bowl in Pasadena for three years is i
that our great tackle Bob "Horse" j
Reynolds played (>0 minutes in all
three games. That is one record that
can never be beaten. This last in- i
formation comes to us through the j
courtesy of Neal van Sooy, Stan- ,
I

ford Alumni Director, who also po
litely informed us that we were
wrong on the first point about con
secutive - trip honors to the Rose
Bowl.
The only thing certain about the
Rose Bowl game so far is that Ala
bama will be the Eastern represent
ative. Alter U.C.L.A. surprisingly
beat the Moraga boys of St. Mary's,
they were high-hurdled into the fa
vorite spot. Westwood was expected
to drub Cal. and then beat U.S.C.
next Saturday afternoon. But Cal
had the good fortune of pulling the
miracle play of the century when
Jack Lerond's bad punt was run
for a touchdown, and being able to
hold U.C.L.A. scoreless, they won
by virtue of that "gift" play.
The Bruins' spot on the gridiron
horizon promptly fell a few notches,
and now the consensus of opinion is
that U.S.C. will beat them in the big
cement saucer in Los Angeles next
Saturday. IF the Trojans win that
game, they will then move over to
Pasadena one month later for the
Rose Bowl game. But what if they
lose? Then Washington State will
be the leading team in the Confer
ence. Most people shudder at that
thought, and we can't say we're not
in that crowd, but we mustn't lose
sight of one sticky fact. Our record
of three trips to the bowl mentioned
in previous paragraphs will be kept
intact if the Phil Sorboe - coached
gang of Pullman make the trip to
Southern Call'ornia for the Tourna
ment of Roses.
And Washington State isn't too
bad. Saturday they whipped Wash
ington, a team that figured several
weeks back as the West Coast am
bassador of football.
By the exhibition of fotball U.C.-
L.A. gave Saturday, however, U.S.C.
should win the contest. The S.C.
Trojans have apparently returned to
life since their three losses, and
whpped Oregon State handily last
Saturday.
How the Trojans will fare against
the Harry Gilmer-led Alabamans is
another thing. But coast teams have
always surprised everyone.
