# Cal Bear Cridders Trip Bruin Rose Bowl Hopes
## 
### 
California "bad - punted" them
selves into a gridiron victory over
U.C.L.A. Saturday afternoon before
a "liquid sunshine-drenched" crowd
of 20,000.
In the third quarter Jack Lerond
shoved back from his regular end
spot to handle the punting chore.
He got a bad center, and the football
lopped off his kicking foot. Cal
rooters moaned, expecting to see a
Uclan down the pigskin deep in
Berkeley territory, but what hap
pens? Ed Welch, a Cal man, picks
up the football and starts running.
Weaving in and out, he gets to the
opposition 30-yard line and is about
to be spilled, but up comes Jack Le
rond, who was revitalized by the
runback after his poor kick, and
takes the ball on a lateral and skirts
his way around several other
would-be tacklers and then crosses
pay dirt, a distinction for Cal play
ers this season. The attempted con
version was blocked, and the Golden
Bear leads, 6-0. That score was also
present on the final tally sheet.
No Bowl for U.C.L.A.
That defeat brutally dampened all
glittering hopes the Westwood Bru
ins had of moving over to Pasadena
on New Year's Day to play in the
Rose Bowl tilt against Alabama. >
Early in the initial period U.C.L.A.
started to roll, but they got stalled
on the Cal four-yard striper. A
pass from Jackie Case to Skip Row
land put the pigskin inside the ten
yard line for U.C.L.A., but on four
attempted plays they couldn't put
the ball across the zero-yard line.
That early threat was also the last
one for the Bruins. In the first quar
ter they out-charged their senior
brothers of Cal, but they couldn't
capitalize on any gains. Ted Ken
field, the lad previously mixed in
the Axe-stealing incident, safely
booted his team out of dangerous
territory at various times.
First break for the Beai's came
when Latimer recovered a fumble
that Brooks Biddle made on a punt

return in the second quarter. With j
Irv Uteritz, the bantam-sized quar- j
terback son of Cal's second coach,
playing field general, the ball was ,
brought to the Uclan seven on a j
pass from Uteritz to Desmond, who
played frosh ball at Santa Clara. '
But the spark that brought them
from the 48 flickered out, and U.C.-
L.A. took over possession, ending
the threat of a Cal marker.
Bruins Outplayed
Aside from their sensational
touchdown scored in the third
quarter, Cal still outplayed the
Westwood invaders in the second
half. Several times they got deep
into Bruin territory, but were un
able to score. The same happened
in the fourth quarter. One Kenfield
kick landed dead on the two-yard
line, but on the exchange of punts,
U.C.L.A. managed to needle their
way out of the tight spot.
After - game grid tabulations
showed that Cal completely out
played their southern brethren in all
departments. The Bruins' much
vaunted pass attack bogged down
in the mud. but Cal—which had the
same rain falling on them—managed
to heave the ball around quite well,
despite the constant downpour.
Kenfield showed up particularly
well in the running department,
slogging through the mud like a
veteran. Of course, the players had
the advantage of sliding for five
yards in the mud whenever they
were tackled. Cal's Homecoming
game was most prosperous.—Levin
