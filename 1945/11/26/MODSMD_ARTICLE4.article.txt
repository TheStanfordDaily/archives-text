of costuming for the play, which is j
set in Russia in the 18!)0's. Balloon

as gifts to the department.
Campbell's costumes during the j
first part of the play are padded to
indicate the plumpness of Sorin, but
as the play progresses, he becomes !

ed shoes.

State College man.

Six-Day Run
This play was under production
before the war but due to a lack of
advanced students, it was abandoned
until this quarter. The usual five
day run of similar plays has been
extended because of the demand for
tickets and the limited capacity of
the Little Theater. A sixth perform
ance of the play will be given at
8:30 Tuesday, after the Tuesday
Evening Series.
