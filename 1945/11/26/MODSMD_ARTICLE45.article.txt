OAK RIDGE, Tenn., Nov. 25 (UP).
â€”Scientists who worked here on
production of the atomic bomb to
night condemned the destruction of
the Japanese cyclotron, announced
last week by American authorities,
as "wanton and stupid."
The Association of Oak Ridge Sci
entists, including some of the na
tion's pioneers in nuclear research,
likened the act to "the sacking of
the Louvain Library by the Ger
mans in 1914 and 1840," and said it
constituted "a crime against human
ity."
Wrecking of the Japanese cyclo
tron was announced Friday by Gen.
! Douglas Mac Arthur.
