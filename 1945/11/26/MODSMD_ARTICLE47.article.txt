# Calendar Sales Held At Cellar, Post Office
## 
### 
! Cap and Gown calendars will be
sold at the Cellar all day and at the
post office from 11 to 12 a.m. and
from 1 to 2 p.m.
Barbara Lamb, president of Cap
j and Gown, pointed out the handi- ]
j ness of this year's desk size. Each
! page just covers a week instead of
| a month and should make them con
; venient for diaries or engagement
j books.
Local Scenes
The fifty-two photographs by Ed |
McLellan are of the University and j
j near-by Peninsula scenes. These- j
j pia-tone 'lustrations are in solid |
! colors, in varying tones of blue, j
| green or brown.
The idea of selling calendars was |
! brought from Scripps College by ;
j Rosamond Clarke, director of Roble
Hall. They were first sold in 1940
j and the illustrations were photo
graphed mainly by Cap and Gown
members.
Money for Fund
The calendars were sold for the
raising of a scholarship fund, the
money for which had formerly come
from benefit card parties or food
sales.
The Unversity Press is printing
3,000 this year, which are going to
be sold through book stores and
alumni clubs all over the nation. A
percentage of the profits will be re
ceived by Cap and Gown, which I
hopes to finance two scholarship

funds instead of the usual one.
Among the best-remembered cal
endars was the one published in
1941 in commemoration of Stanford's
fiftieth anniversary.
The Unversity's early days were
pictured. Included were prints of
the steeple of the Memorial Church
and the Roble bridge. The steeple
and parts of the Church were de
stroyed in the earthquake of 1906.
