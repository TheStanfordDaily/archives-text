# Critic Calls 'Junior Miss' Amusing Frivolous Fluff
## 
### 
"Junior Miss," which opened at
the Varsity yesterday, is a bit of I
frivolous fluff that may amuse some
body but, for the most part, fails to '
entertain. Adapted from the Broad- j
way show, some of the sequences j
are youthfully amusing but for the
most part the scenes are disjointed
and short on anything but forced
humor.
Little Peggy Anrt Garner fails to
; shine as she did as Francie in "A
| Tree Grows in Brooklyn.' From
I past performances we Know this
little girl can act hut Twentieth
Century-Fox was unwise in wast- J
ing her talents in "Junior Miss." '
Some reports have stated that this
was originally scheduled as a "B" I
production but the Fox bosses liked
it so well they moved it into the
"A" class with a big cross-country
promotion build-up. Judging from j
the picture, Fox would have done j

well to leave it in the "B" class.
Here it would have been perfectly
satisfactory.
In comparison with Columbia's
likewise adolescent "Kiss and Tell."
"Junior Miss" falls far short. The
Shirley Temple picture is scream
ingly funny and presents all the sit
uations of the stage show uncen
sored.
Also on the Varsity bill is the
very good "Story of G.I. Joe." One
of the better pictures to come out of
Hollywoiod durng the war years,
Lester Cowan has done a fine job
with this memorial to Ernie Pyle.
