In addressing the women of Union
Unit last night, Philip Buck, pro
fessor of political science, said that
if the world didn't organiz.e inter
nationally the only way to live with
out horror of the atomic bomb
would be to move about 200 feet
underground.
Immediately after dinner, the Un
ion women assembled in the Wom
en's Clubhouse to hear Paul Kirk
patrick, professor of physics and
acting dean of the School of Physical
Sciences, and Mr. Buck speak on
atomic power.
Mr. Kirkpatrick reviewed the
structure of the atom with the use
of slides. He said that atomic en
ergy was more practical in larger
units. According to Mr. Kirk
patrick, it would take 100 million
atoms to make a string an inch
long.
Referring to the outlawing of
poison gas, Mr. Buck stated that the
reason that action was so easily
taken and upheld was that other
weapons proved more effective. The
atomic bomb is the greatest and
most dangerous discovery in sci
ence, and there is no defense against
it.
Mr. Buck suggested placing the
atomic weapon in the hands of
an international authority which
would be powerful because it pos
sessed the atomic bomb. Mr.
Kirkpatrick stated that he didn't
believe a world union would work.
In conclusion questions were
asked from the floor.
