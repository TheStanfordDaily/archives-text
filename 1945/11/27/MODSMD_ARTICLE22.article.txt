# Election Date Plans Tabled
## 
### 
After much discussion on whether
to have a uniform election date for
all women's living groups, members
of Women's Conference decided at
yesterday's meeting to refer the
question to the various unit excoms
and take up the issue next quarter.
Lagunita casas and Union Unit
houses now elect their offices in the
middle of wnter quarter to serve
the rest of the year, and at the end
of spring quarter to serve all of fall
quarter and part of winter. Row '
houses elect their officers once a
year, but there has been no uniform j
election date for the houses as a |
whole.
The queston of whether or not j
to have a uniform election date i
depends upon the preference for
having a complete turnover of
Conference members or a carry- j
over in Conference. It was I
thought that a better leadership
program could be given if there i
were a complete turnover in Con- j
fcrcncc. Others thought that a
carry-over would give Conference
more continuity.
The Scholarship Steering Com- !
mit tec will moot Wednesday at 4:30 j
p.m. at Lathrop to figure out. the l
basis for determining the scholar- !
ship award. The award will be given \
to the house will) the highest schol
arship at the end of each quarter, j
Any steering committee member I
who cannot attend the meeting
should notify Beaty O'Hair, chair
man.
The members arr> Betsy Wilson,
representing Lagunita; Mary Ellen
Booth, Union Unit; Merlon Albrecht, I
Row; Betty Davies, Ventura; Marie I
Wagner, Roblc; Audrey Call. Bran
t'Cr; and May Reams, Klahoya.
Mary lon McClurc, chairman of
Housing Committee, reported that
there are eight corridors of fresh
men and transfers who have not
been entertained under the in
formal entertainment program.
Houses should clear their enter
tainment dales through Social
Committee by calling Joan Bailey,
904,'1, or Shirley Marks, so
that all corridors will be enter
tained.
The Conference constitution was j
passed.
