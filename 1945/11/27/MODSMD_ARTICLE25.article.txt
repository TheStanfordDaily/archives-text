Liberal Arts Proposal
Eeiieving that the greatest value of a uni
versity lies in its ability to expose the student
to o wide variety of ideas, facts, and realistic
experiences and situations so that he may be
hot'", equipped to take an intelligent and con
structive role in post college society, we read
v. : ith interest the proposal for a revised liberal
ail;; program which the Consulting Committee
on IJ dergraduate Studies has submitted to
the: University Academic Council.
Th-' proposed plan would seem to go a long
way toward eliminating two educational "bug
aboos" (1) the tendency for undergraduate
study to become purely pre-professional, with
the consequent neglect of a broad, well-bal
anccd, liberal education; and (2) the forcing
of students to relearn material they already
know.
Th-. proposal includes plans for requiring
ov r y student who receives the A.B. degree to
"demonstrate a certain competence" in English,
Speech, Mathematics, History, Natural Sci
one s, Foreign Language, Social Sciences, Lit
erature, Fine Arts, Philosophy, and "a selected
treati'.e intensively studied." To eliminate the
rele. uiing of material, the plan would estab
lish "optional achievement tests which, if
passed, would release students from the obliga
tion of taking required courses."
Th .' plan, committee members state, still re
tains for the schools and departments their
pre ;-'.-it freedom to determine what is best for
their majors. They also say that the present re
quirements for most pre-professional students
"con be met within the framework of the pro
pose:! liberal arts program."
In yesterday's Daily will be found a full
explanation of the committee's proposal. It is
now under faculty scrutiny; its progress may
also bear careful student attention, for it is
being prepared for you—for all Stanford stu
dents interested in acquiring "an adequate
liberal education."
