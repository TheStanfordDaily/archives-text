### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The world's two most threatening trouble
spots are China and Iran. Both are the scenes
of violent conflicts. Both represent a deeper
underlying issue than appears at first glance,
namely, that of Soviet Russia's expansion.
Russia today is a highly organized bargain
ing agent. While our leaders are talking about
peace and a mystical god called "Big 3 Unity,"
the Russian leaders are preparing their con
stituents for the worst, so as to have them in
back of any new diplomatic moves, no matter
what the conseguences.
KALININ
Said Kalinin, the major menace, that of Nazi
Germany, is gone, but Russia still faces capi
talistic encirclement. Said Molotov, the rest of
the world is trying to form blocs against us.
Says the Russian radio, the present policies of
Britain and the United States can only lead to
a war.
It might possibly occur to these gentlemen
that oui sign of good faith was that we didn't
drop an atom bomb on Moscow the same day
we blasted Hiroshima. But they also realize
that nobody in the Western World is psycho
logically prepared for trouble, and if they can
get the Russians in that state, they can force
through a few Munichs in the name of "just
and lasting peace."
IRAN
The first visible step in this policy has been
the Iranian situation. In the late nineteenth

century, Britain and Russia divided the Middle
and Far East giving Britain a sphere of influ
ence over southern Iran, Afghanistan, Baluch
istan, and Tibet. Russia, who was then weak,
got only Northern Iran and the tribes she was
then conquering in central Asia.
In 1919, she gave up here sphere in north
ern Iran in order to create good will for the
Soviets in the Middle East. But she apparently
considers that its worth having now, so she
has organized one of the backward tribes of
the country, the Kurds, given thern machine
guns, and started a revolution. America is de
manding an explanation, and so is Iran, but
the negotiations are in a very difficult stage.
MANCHURIA
Chiang is doing well in his war with the Com
munists. Three Nationalist armies have pushed
the Eighth Route Army out of the Red coastal
anchor at Shan-hai-kwan, and now the Nation
alists #re trying to straddle the railway north
to Liaoyang and get a port, the latter so as to
nullify any Communist attempt to cut off their
bulge at the base.
The Russians have strengthened their Man
churian garrisons by twenty thousand men in
order to "preserve order." The Chinese Com
munists charge that the Russians are holding
them until the Nationalists take over, and the
Nationalists are replying that the Russians are
pricing this support higher than the infamous
Japanese "21 demands," which China described
as "written on war office stationery that was
watermarked with machine guns," valued Japa
nese nonintervention in China at the end of the
last war.
PICTURE
Also, there is a revolution going on in Chi
nese Turkestan, which is not being reported
because of bad communications.
The situation is that the oil in Turkestan and
the iron in Manchuria are the only hopes China
has for industrialization. Russia seems to be
trying to take them over, so as to prevent that
industrialization and lower the menace of a
growing China on her flank. She is willing to
sell out the local Communist party to do it, be
cause Russia's consistent policy since Stalin
has taken over has been aggrandizement rather
than Russian imperialism.
Since Iran is also a valuable prop, the pres
ent stage of Russian expansion seems to be to
strengthen the weak points in her frontiers.
Any reasonable and obective statesman could
see that the way to avoid war with America
would be simply to turn inwards and indus
trialize, rather than rob Russia's neighbors.
Therefore this must be the first step in a
planned Russian expansion.
SOLUTION
Armed force as a diplomatic tool has been
much maligned. Yet, by winning the numer
ous "border incidents" in Siberia, Russia taught
Japan that the wisest course of expansion was
not in that direction. By keeping a realistic
outlook and a reasonable state of armaments,
we might convince Russia that the wisest ex
pansion is not outward, at all.
