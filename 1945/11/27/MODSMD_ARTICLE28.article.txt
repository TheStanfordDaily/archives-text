The days following every vacation of any sort al
ways bring a certain number of stories concerning
amusing incidents during the recess. One which
reached my ears and traveled to my funnybone is
worth passing on, I think.
A certain Stanford co-ed (plus plenty in the
bawlout—l looked it lip) was Hying home for the
holidays and, true to her policy of hiding the hooks
at every opportunity, she carried her textbooks with
her on the flight. The afore-mentioned lass changed
planes down in the valley somewhere, and as the
plane began its taxi to the runway, our subject real
ized she had left her psych book on the first plane,
now standing idle near the hangar.
Screaming loudly and banging on the pilot's cabin
door, the study bug finally brought the plane to a halt
and explained her unbearable predicament. With tra
ditional chivalry and courtesy the pilot stopped the
plane and held up the flight for several minutes while
our girl scampered to her original plane and gathered
up her coveted book and returned ready for the take
off.
What price some people will pay to go plus! T also
understand that a certain air-line was thrown off
schedule last Wednesday and it took three days to
make it up. Now I know why trains are always late.
* * *
At least 50 persons approached me yesterday and
each one uttered the now-boring phrase, "And did you
have a nice Thanksgiving, hmmm?" I like the concern
of my friends, but in order not to complicate things
and make me hide around Quad corners when I see
anyone I know stepping my way, I will forward the
following: I had a wonderful vacation; Modesto won
all its football games; our town slogan still is "Water,
Wealth, Contentment, Health," and quit laughing; and
my tim? was spent consuming good food, good drink
and good sleep. That's all. Very simple. Thank you
very much. Hope you had the same!
* * *
We liked the Cap and Gown calendars this year.
The fifty-two photographs by Ed McLlellan of the
University and nearby Peninsula scenes are the best
yet. A picture album and a date book for only a
dollar. What a bargain!
* * *
Latest reports on the sale of tickets to the forth
coming Red and White Ball are that they are going
like next year's pajamas on bargain day. Skinnay En
nis at $5 a ducat is about as hard to take as a Tom and
Jerry on a winter day.
* * *
I'll take two to one that Tracy doesn't catch Itchy
within the next fifteen comic strips. This fellow
Gould must be having a miserable time thinking up
a character to replace The Itch. And the best thing
to help my breakfast digestion would be for Smilin'
Jerk to really lose his head and crash the 11-2JJ
tarrying the atom bomb. But he won't. He'll find a
way out; just wait and see.

now standing idle near the hangar.
Screaming loudly and banging on the pilot's cabin
door, the study bug finally brought the plane to a halt
and explained her unbearable predicament. With tra
ditional chivalry and courtesy the pilot stopped the
plane and held up the flight for several minutes while
our girl scampered to her original plane and gathered
up her coveted book and returned ready for the take
off.
What price some people will pay to go plus! T also
understand that a certain air-line was thrown off
schedule last Wednesday and it took three days to
make it up. Now I know why trains are always late.

At least 50 persons approached me yesterday and
each one uttered the now-boring phrase, "And did you
have a nice Thanksgiving, hmmm?" I like the concern
of my friends, but in order not to complicate things
and make me hide around Quad corners when I see
anyone I know stepping my way, I will forward the
following: I had a wonderful vacation; Modesto won
all its football games; our town slogan still is "Water,
Wealth, Contentment, Health," and quit laughing; and
my tim? was spent consuming good food, good drink
and good sleep. That's all. Very simple. Thank you
very much. Hope you had the same!

We liked the Cap and Gown calendars this year.
The fifty-two photographs by Ed McLlellan of the
University and nearby Peninsula scenes are the best
yet. A picture album and a date book for only a
dollar. What a bargain!

Latest reports on the sale of tickets to the forth
coming Red and White Ball are that they are going
like next year's pajamas on bargain day. Skinnay En
nis at $5 a ducat is about as hard to take as a Tom and
Jerry on a winter day.

I'll take two to one that Tracy doesn't catch Itchy
within the next fifteen comic strips. This fellow
Gould must be having a miserable time thinking up
a character to replace The Itch. And the best thing
to help my breakfast digestion would be for Smilin'
Jerk to really lose his head and crash the 11-2JJ
tarrying the atom bomb. But he won't. He'll find a
way out; just wait and see.
The days following every vacation of any sort al
ways bring a certain number of stories concerning
amusing incidents during the recess. One which
reached my ears and traveled to my funnybone is
worth passing on, I think.
A certain Stanford co-ed (plus plenty in the
bawlout—l looked it lip) was Hying home for the
holidays and, true to her policy of hiding the hooks
at every opportunity, she carried her textbooks with
her on the flight. The afore-mentioned lass changed
planes down in the valley somewhere, and as the
plane began its taxi to the runway, our subject real
ized she had left her psych book on the first plane,
now standing idle near the hangar.
Screaming loudly and banging on the pilot's cabin
door, the study bug finally brought the plane to a halt
and explained her unbearable predicament. With tra
