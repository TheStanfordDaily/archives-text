# Union Women Send Clothes To France
## 
### 
Everything from "woolens to
handkerchiefs" will be sent to
France by Union Unit in their cloth
ing drive which is being conducted
this week.
Miss Lucie Lataillade, director of
Lagunita, has been sending clothes
to friends and relatives in France
since April of this year. The resi
dents of Union Unit heard about her
efforts and offered to help her col
lect clothes.
Jane Vinson, chairman of the
drive at all the Union houses, has
announced that the collection will
be held all this week, and Miss La
has expressed her appreciation to
Union for their aid.
Need Desperate
According to Lagunita's director
the people of France are in desper
ate need of any type of food or
clothing. She has sent coffee, sugar,
and cocoa as well as articles Of
wearing apparel.
Miss La states that her friends
have made no designation as to the
type of clothes desired. She added,
however, that the young girls in
France wear the same kind of out
fits worn by Stanford girls, and that
the Union drive will probably sup
ply her younger friends.
Cities Starve
Even rags are acceptable dona
tions to the collection, Miss La an
nounced. The people of France are
in need of any kind of material. She
states that city people request food

while the rural inhabitants seek
clothing most anxiously.
Only recently have shoes been
lifted from a list restricting ar
ticles to be mailed overseas. As
soon as Miss La learns the correct
sizes, she will begin collecting them
for her friends.
Although the packages reach
France in the relatively short time
of two months, said Miss La. her
friends have reported that certain
articles have been missing from the
packages. They assume the food
and clothes-hungry inspectors re
move some of the items for them
selves.
