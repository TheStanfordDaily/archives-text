# Indian Basketballers Will Meet Moffett
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Stanford's post-war edition of
an Everett Dean basketball team
will play its second game of the
season this Thursday night against
a visiting Moffett Field quintet at
the Pavilion at X o'clock.
There will also be a junior var
sity contest at 6:30.
Sharing the spotlight with this
news is the announcement of the
Farm's '45-'4(i Pacific Coast Con
ference basketball schedule by AI
Masters. The list of 12 games for
each team was decided upon at a
meeting of officials of Southern
California, U.C.L.A., California,
and Stanford during Thanksgiving
vacation. Masters and Dean at
tended for Stanford.
The non conference schedule
which will fill the full month of
December and any open dates dur
ing the regular season is constantly
growing and should swell the total
game quota to around 20.
With this addition, the team has
been introduced to both of the best
known ways of playing basket
ball. The men have had work in
them both, but to say that they are
smooth in working them is an
other thing. For the most part
they are still green. But they are
improving fast and are mastering
many of (he techniques of college
basketball.
Yesterday's practice, the first
since Thanksgiving, was a good hard
one. Besides the work on offense
and defense, Dean spent a few min
utes with his centers. He gave them
several new pivot shots and helped
them with their finesse and faking.
He also showed the squad a few out

\ of-bounds pass plays.
The first string was composed,
temporarily, of Hill, C'hillson,
| King, Christianson, and I'itts.
Tom Rodman, who usually holds
down a guard spot, was not pres
ent.
"We worked off a lot of turkey
and mince pie," said Coach Dean
after practice. "I want to be sure
that we are in condition for that
Moffett Field game Thursday."
There was a smile on everyone's
face around the B.A.C. and the
gym yesterday when Masters offi
cially announced Stanford's con
ference schedule in basketball. It
was the first time in three years
that the Indians had been directly
connected with the conference ac
tivities.
As it stands now, Stanford's bas
ketball schedule includes 18 games.
This number will probably rise from
time to time as the free dates are
filled. Masters is looking into the
possibility of adding Santa Clara
[ and San Francisco U. somewhere
along the line. »

many of (he techniques of college
basketball.
Yesterday's practice, the first
since Thanksgiving, was a good hard
one. Besides the work on offense
and defense, Dean spent a few min
utes with his centers. He gave them
several new pivot shots and helped
them with their finesse and faking.
He also showed the squad a few out

\ of-bounds pass plays.
The first string was composed,
temporarily, of Hill, C'hillson,
| King, Christianson, and I'itts.
Tom Rodman, who usually holds
down a guard spot, was not pres
ent.
"We worked off a lot of turkey
and mince pie," said Coach Dean
after practice. "I want to be sure
that we are in condition for that
Moffett Field game Thursday."
There was a smile on everyone's
face around the B.A.C. and the
gym yesterday when Masters offi
cially announced Stanford's con
ference schedule in basketball. It
was the first time in three years
that the Indians had been directly
connected with the conference ac
tivities.
As it stands now, Stanford's bas
ketball schedule includes 18 games.
This number will probably rise from
time to time as the free dates are
filled. Masters is looking into the
possibility of adding Santa Clara
[ and San Francisco U. somewhere
along the line. »
Stanford's post-war edition of
an Everett Dean basketball team
will play its second game of the
season this Thursday night against
a visiting Moffett Field quintet at
the Pavilion at X o'clock.
There will also be a junior var
sity contest at 6:30.
Sharing the spotlight with this
news is the announcement of the
Farm's '45-'4(i Pacific Coast Con
ference basketball schedule by AI
Masters. The list of 12 games for
each team was decided upon at a
meeting of officials of Southern
California, U.C.L.A., California,
and Stanford during Thanksgiving
vacation. Masters and Dean at
tended for Stanford.
The non conference schedule
which will fill the full month of
December and any open dates dur
ing the regular season is constantly
growing and should swell the total
game quota to around 20.
With this addition, the team has
been introduced to both of the best
known ways of playing basket
ball. The men have had work in
them both, but to say that they are
smooth in working them is an
other thing. For the most part
they are still green. But they are
improving fast and are mastering
many of (he techniques of college
basketball.
