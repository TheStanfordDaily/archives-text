Wrestling class members are now petitioning for the privi
lege of sporting the famed circle "S" which is now earned by
athletes who have participated in a minor sport and won the
right to wear a letter. The basis for the petition circulated by
Coach Ted Mumby's proteges is well founded considering that
Eastern and Middle Western colleges offer wrestling as a major
activity. Wrestling as it is now considered does not offer much
incentive to prospective Indian grapplers who have to put in
just as much time and effort as the fellows who are training for
football or basketball.
MUMBY HAS COLORFUL HISTORY
Stanford has the nucleus of a championship sguad in Mel
Bruno, national intercollegiate wrestling champion, and Oscar
Thompson, a promising novice. Moreover they will have the
benefit of the experience of an excellent coach in Ted Mumby.
Mumby probably has one of the most colorful and least pub
licized backgrounds of any of the Cardinal coaching staff, and
was, incidentally, attending the University of Indiana at the
same time as Everett Dean, head basketball coach here.
During his collegiate days Mumby developed into a top-notch
165-pound wrestler at Indiana, and won many honors for his
school. He now weighs a hefty 200 of which every pound is
muscle. He was also first string guard at Indiana and captain
of the wrestling team during his senior year at lU. Mumby's
versatility was not limited to the mat, for while pouring over
some of Ted's scrap books we found that he was chosen as an
all-state guard too.
COACHED AT LCC
After leaving Indiana, Mumby accepted a position as ath
letic director at Lucknow Christian College in India, and believe
it or not he really looks snappy in a native turban. We saw
several photos of Ted with his Indian teams, and his well kept
memoirs seem to do away with the popular conception that the
United States is the only country where football and basketball
are played. It was rather interesting and amusing to see pic
tures of Mumby and his team with LCC across their jerseys.
WRESTLING A MINOR SPORT?
Ted stayed in India until 1941, and then from India he came
to the Indians; so it really seems plausible that Stanford could
put a winning team into the square circle. Tennis, golf, and
swimming are considered minor sports and there is no reason
why wrestling should not take its place along side the others.
Your representatives on Ex-Com will have to decide this issue;
so why not throw in a little public opinion along with the pe
titions and give Stanford a wrestling team that will further
Stanford's athletic reputation.

titions and give Stanford a wrestling team that will further
Stanford's athletic reputation.
Wrestling class members are now petitioning for the privi
lege of sporting the famed circle "S" which is now earned by
athletes who have participated in a minor sport and won the
right to wear a letter. The basis for the petition circulated by
Coach Ted Mumby's proteges is well founded considering that
Eastern and Middle Western colleges offer wrestling as a major
activity. Wrestling as it is now considered does not offer much
incentive to prospective Indian grapplers who have to put in
just as much time and effort as the fellows who are training for
football or basketball.
MUMBY HAS COLORFUL HISTORY
Stanford has the nucleus of a championship sguad in Mel
Bruno, national intercollegiate wrestling champion, and Oscar
Thompson, a promising novice. Moreover they will have the
benefit of the experience of an excellent coach in Ted Mumby.
Mumby probably has one of the most colorful and least pub
licized backgrounds of any of the Cardinal coaching staff, and
was, incidentally, attending the University of Indiana at the
same time as Everett Dean, head basketball coach here.
During his collegiate days Mumby developed into a top-notch
165-pound wrestler at Indiana, and won many honors for his
school. He now weighs a hefty 200 of which every pound is
muscle. He was also first string guard at Indiana and captain
of the wrestling team during his senior year at lU. Mumby's
versatility was not limited to the mat, for while pouring over
some of Ted's scrap books we found that he was chosen as an
all-state guard too.
COACHED AT LCC
After leaving Indiana, Mumby accepted a position as ath
letic director at Lucknow Christian College in India, and believe
it or not he really looks snappy in a native turban. We saw
several photos of Ted with his Indian teams, and his well kept
memoirs seem to do away with the popular conception that the
United States is the only country where football and basketball
are played. It was rather interesting and amusing to see pic
tures of Mumby and his team with LCC across their jerseys.
WRESTLING A MINOR SPORT?
Ted stayed in India until 1941, and then from India he came
to the Indians; so it really seems plausible that Stanford could
put a winning team into the square circle. Tennis, golf, and
swimming are considered minor sports and there is no reason
why wrestling should not take its place along side the others.
Your representatives on Ex-Com will have to decide this issue;
so why not throw in a little public opinion along with the pe
titions and give Stanford a wrestling team that will further
Stanford's athletic reputation.
