# Indians Tackle Cadet Eleven
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Biggest grid fray of the week—of
course—will be Stanford versus the
San Mateo Merchant Marine Acad
emy. San Mateo, coached by A 1 Fa
getti, has had a highly successful
grid season, losing only to San Jose I
and running up an impressive record
against other grid foes. Stanford, in
its initial start in three years, lost
the game to the Stockton Comman
dos led by ex-pro Bob Krieger.
Despite the Merchant Marine
Academy's good record, Farm par
tisanship makes us tab Stanford as
winners by a good margin.
California winds up its grid sea
son against St. Mary's Pre-Flight in
the big Berkeley bowl. Cal's record
till last Saturday was most dismal.
They had lost to U.S.C. twice, lost to
Oregon, lost to U.C.L.A., lost to St.
Mary's, tied Washington State, beat
en Nevada by a narrow margin, and
beaten the Huskies from the Uni
versity of Washington. But last Sat
urday was the day for their stars to
shine, despite the constant down
pour. The beat U.C.L.A., a heavy
pre-game favorite, and the odds-on
favorite to go Arroyo Seco way, as
Will Connolly, our estimable com
patriot of the fourth estate, would
say.
The Bears' sudden elevation to
gridiron glory rates their tussle with
Pre-Flight strictly a toss-up, with
the flyers probably close-in favor
ites. The Navy team has been los
ing players via the discharge route,
but theirs still is an assemblage of
gridiron greats to give any team a
good game. We take St. Mary's Pre-
Flight.
The West Coast's representative to
the Rose Bowl will be decided in
the big cement saucer in Los Ange
les. Jeff Cravath's Trojans of U.S.C.
play Bert Laßrucherie's Uclans from
Westwood. S.C. has been an "up

and down" team all year, but with
U.C.L.A. defeat at the hands of Cal,
El Trojan figures as the pre-game
favorite. The Bruins are completely
out of the running themselves for
Rose Bowl honors, but if they beat
U.S.C., that team will also be out of
the running for the bowl bid, and
our dear friends from Washington
State will oppose Alabama in the
Tournament of Roses festivity. And
that possibility is no distant and
vague possibility.
To our north Oregon State plays
its old rival Oregon. This is the first
year of grid competition for both
teams for three years, and they have
done surprisingly well. Oregon has
had the benefit of having the serv
ices of Jake Leieht, a triple-threat
backfield man if there ever was one.
And aiding him in the backfield
have been men of such caliber as
Walt Donovan, chosen on the ex
clusive Daily all-Coast team, and
Bobby Reynolds, sepian star de luxe.
O.S.C. has featured Don Gray and
Bob Stephens in the backfield, the
only two men on the team with any
college experience. Lon Stiner, Cor
vallis coach, has done very well in
moulding a team out of inexperi
enced men. Our choice for the fray,
however, is Oregon.
