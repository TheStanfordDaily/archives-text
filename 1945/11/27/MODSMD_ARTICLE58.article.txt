# Executives Agree Advancement Depends on Ability
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON GEORGE BRUNN 
A college diploma is no guaran
tee for a soft job, emphasized ex
ecutives of live West Coast com
panies interviewed yesterday in
San Francisco by two Daily re
porters during the first part of a
two-day tour sponsored by the
National Association of Manufac
turers to acquaint college students
with job opportunities.
The notion of entering a firm as
junior executive was discouraged by
top management officials of Califor
nia Packing Corporation, Crown
Zellerbach Corporation, the Matson
Steamship Lines, Pope and Talbot
Shipping and Lumber Company, and
Lilli-Ann Manufacturing Company,
in informal talks with representa
tives from Stanford, the University
of California, and San Jose State
College.
Executives interviewed were A.
D. Layton, Stanford '24, vice-pres
ident of Crown Zellerbach Cor
poration: A. W. Ford, director of
industrial relations at California
Packing Corporation; Hugh Gal
lagher, vice-president of Matson

Shipping Lines; Charles Wheeler,
vice-president of Pope and Tal
bot Shipping and Lumber Com
pany; and Adolpli A. Schumann,
president of Lilli-Ann Manufac
turing Company.
They seemed to agree that a col
lege-trained man has on the aver
age a better chance of rising to a
responsible position, but were care
ful to stress that advancement is
largely dependent on individual
ability.
Their opinions differed, however,
on the type of college education
most desirable. Mr. Layton, inter
viewed in his office in the Crown
Zellerbach Building, pointed out
that college education should train
a man or a woman to think. "Our
corporation is so large that we can
employ persons of almost any back
ground and interest. For instance,
at present we need engineers, chem
ists, accountants, public relations
men, statisticians, and skilled and
unskilled labor," Mr. Layton stated.
On the other hand, Mr. Gallagher
and Mr. Wheeler advised the stu
dent to know what he wants to do
and then to specialize in that field.
Mr. Wheeler said that, if, for in
stance, a young person wanted to
go into the rice business he should
study rice all through college, find
out all he could about rice and then
go into business for himself.
All five of the officials hold fast

to the "Horatio Alger" principle
of working your way up in busi
ness. The only way to know a
business is to learn it from the
bottom up, they said.
Mr. Layton himself, after having
majored in economics and minored
in history at Stanford, started his
career as a mill-hand in a North
west plant. Mr. Gallagher said that
his first position was as shoe clerk
for Matson Lines. Mr. Schumann,
energetic head of America's largest
ladies' suit manufacturing concern,
said that he got his start in business
after being kicked out of the Uni
versity of California.
All of the executives pointed out
that promotions arc generally
from the ranks of the companies.
Mr. Ford, for instance, explained
that at CalPak a new employee
first learns the various laboring
processes such as receiving, truck
ing. and cooking, and advances to
higher positions according to his
abilities and seniority. Even sales
men start as clerks to obtain the
operational picture of the estab
lishment.
Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Gallagher,
looking to the expanding markets of
the Pacific, said in effect, "Go West,
young man or woman!" They com
mented that there will be numerous
Army and Navy bases such as the
one on Guam, and new markets in
China, the Philippines and Hawaii.

In Hawaii, for instance, even the
most pessimistic estimates predict
a 25 per cent business expansion,
Mr. Gallagher said.
The United States, with its plants
undestroyed by war, and the West
Coast and the Northwest in particu
lar with their cheap power and plen
tiful raw materials, has an advan
tage over all other nations.
The 7500-ton Matson freighter
"Mahimahi," on which the report
ers had lunch with Capt. H. J.
Niclson, Mr. Wheeler and Mr.
Gallagher, illustrated shipping's
reconversion problem. Ack - ack
guns and gray war paint have dis
appeared and the vessel again is
carrying furniture and other civil
ian products for Islanders instead
of military supplies. Mr. Galla
gher estimated the cost of recon

verting one ship to be $3,600,000,
which the government pays.
Mr. Schumann, head of the Man
ufacturers' and Wholesalers' Asso
ciation, said that the garment indus
try was the only one at present in
which a person could "start his own
business with eight hundred bucks
and a prayer." He said that the
clothing industry is the only one
still uncontrolled by big business
and that "style," not capital, deter
mined the success or failure of a
concern.

stance, a young person wanted to
go into the rice business he should
study rice all through college, find
out all he could about rice and then
go into business for himself.
All five of the officials hold fast

to the "Horatio Alger" principle
of working your way up in busi
ness. The only way to know a
business is to learn it from the
bottom up, they said.
Mr. Layton himself, after having
majored in economics and minored
in history at Stanford, started his
career as a mill-hand in a North
west plant. Mr. Gallagher said that
his first position was as shoe clerk
for Matson Lines. Mr. Schumann,
energetic head of America's largest
ladies' suit manufacturing concern,
said that he got his start in business
after being kicked out of the Uni
versity of California.
All of the executives pointed out
that promotions arc generally
from the ranks of the companies.
Mr. Ford, for instance, explained
that at CalPak a new employee
first learns the various laboring
processes such as receiving, truck
ing. and cooking, and advances to
higher positions according to his
abilities and seniority. Even sales
men start as clerks to obtain the
operational picture of the estab
lishment.
Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Gallagher,
looking to the expanding markets of
the Pacific, said in effect, "Go West,
young man or woman!" They com
mented that there will be numerous
Army and Navy bases such as the
one on Guam, and new markets in
China, the Philippines and Hawaii.

In Hawaii, for instance, even the
most pessimistic estimates predict
a 25 per cent business expansion,
Mr. Gallagher said.
The United States, with its plants
undestroyed by war, and the West
Coast and the Northwest in particu
lar with their cheap power and plen
tiful raw materials, has an advan
tage over all other nations.

reconversion problem. Ack - ack
guns and gray war paint have dis

carrying furniture and other civil
ian products for Islanders instead

gher estimated the cost of recon

verting one ship to be $3,600,000,
which the government pays.
Mr. Schumann, head of the Man
ufacturers' and Wholesalers' Asso
ciation, said that the garment indus
try was the only one at present in
which a person could "start his own
business with eight hundred bucks
and a prayer." He said that the
clothing industry is the only one
still uncontrolled by big business
and that "style," not capital, deter
mined the success or failure of a
concern.

A college diploma is no guaran

ecutives of live West Coast com
panies interviewed yesterday in
San Francisco by two Daily re
porters during the first part of a
two-day tour sponsored by the
National Association of Manufac
turers to acquaint college students
with job opportunities.
The notion of entering a firm as
junior executive was discouraged by
top management officials of Califor
nia Packing Corporation, Crown
Zellerbach Corporation, the Matson
Steamship Lines, Pope and Talbot
Shipping and Lumber Company, and
Lilli-Ann Manufacturing Company,
in informal talks with representa
tives from Stanford, the University
of California, and San Jose State

Executives interviewed were A.
D. Layton, Stanford '24, vice-pres

Shipping Lines; Charles Wheeler,
vice-president of Pope and Tal

president of Lilli-Ann Manufac
turing Company.
They seemed to agree that a col
lege-trained man has on the aver
age a better chance of rising to a
responsible position, but were care
ful to stress that advancement is
largely dependent on individual
ability.
Their opinions differed, however,
on the type of college education
most desirable. Mr. Layton, inter
viewed in his office in the Crown
Zellerbach Building, pointed out
that college education should train
a man or a woman to think. "Our
corporation is so large that we can
employ persons of almost any back
ground and interest. For instance,
at present we need engineers, chem
ists, accountants, public relations
men, statisticians, and skilled and
unskilled labor," Mr. Layton stated.
On the other hand, Mr. Gallagher
and Mr. Wheeler advised the stu
dent to know what he wants to do
and then to specialize in that field.

A college diploma is no guaran
tee for a soft job, emphasized ex
ecutives of live West Coast com
panies interviewed yesterday in
San Francisco by two Daily re
porters during the first part of a
two-day tour sponsored by the
National Association of Manufac
turers to acquaint college students
with job opportunities.
The notion of entering a firm as
junior executive was discouraged by
top management officials of Califor
nia Packing Corporation, Crown
Zellerbach Corporation, the Matson
Steamship Lines, Pope and Talbot
Shipping and Lumber Company, and
Lilli-Ann Manufacturing Company,
in informal talks with representa
tives from Stanford, the University
of California, and San Jose State
College.
Executives interviewed were A.
D. Layton, Stanford '24, vice-pres
ident of Crown Zellerbach Cor
poration: A. W. Ford, director of
industrial relations at California
Packing Corporation; Hugh Gal
lagher, vice-president of Matson

Shipping Lines; Charles Wheeler,
vice-president of Pope and Tal
bot Shipping and Lumber Com
pany; and Adolpli A. Schumann,
president of Lilli-Ann Manufac
turing Company.
They seemed to agree that a col
lege-trained man has on the aver
age a better chance of rising to a
responsible position, but were care
ful to stress that advancement is
largely dependent on individual
ability.
Their opinions differed, however,
on the type of college education
most desirable. Mr. Layton, inter
viewed in his office in the Crown
Zellerbach Building, pointed out
that college education should train
a man or a woman to think. "Our
corporation is so large that we can
employ persons of almost any back
ground and interest. For instance,
at present we need engineers, chem
ists, accountants, public relations
men, statisticians, and skilled and
unskilled labor," Mr. Layton stated.
On the other hand, Mr. Gallagher
and Mr. Wheeler advised the stu
dent to know what he wants to do
and then to specialize in that field.
Mr. Wheeler said that, if, for in
stance, a young person wanted to
go into the rice business he should
study rice all through college, find
out all he could about rice and then
go into business for himself.
All five of the officials hold fast

to the "Horatio Alger" principle
of working your way up in busi
ness. The only way to know a
business is to learn it from the
bottom up, they said.
Mr. Layton himself, after having
majored in economics and minored
in history at Stanford, started his
career as a mill-hand in a North
west plant. Mr. Gallagher said that
his first position was as shoe clerk
for Matson Lines. Mr. Schumann,
energetic head of America's largest
ladies' suit manufacturing concern,
said that he got his start in business
after being kicked out of the Uni
versity of California.
All of the executives pointed out
that promotions arc generally
from the ranks of the companies.
Mr. Ford, for instance, explained
that at CalPak a new employee
first learns the various laboring
processes such as receiving, truck
ing. and cooking, and advances to
higher positions according to his
abilities and seniority. Even sales
men start as clerks to obtain the
operational picture of the estab
lishment.
Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Gallagher,
looking to the expanding markets of
the Pacific, said in effect, "Go West,
young man or woman!" They com
mented that there will be numerous
Army and Navy bases such as the
one on Guam, and new markets in
China, the Philippines and Hawaii.

In Hawaii, for instance, even the
most pessimistic estimates predict
a 25 per cent business expansion,
Mr. Gallagher said.
The United States, with its plants
undestroyed by war, and the West
Coast and the Northwest in particu
lar with their cheap power and plen
tiful raw materials, has an advan
tage over all other nations.
