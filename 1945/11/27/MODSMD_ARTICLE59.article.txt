# 'Magic Flute' Tryouts Begin
## 
### 
Tryouts for the opera production
of the winter quarter, "The Magic
Flute," by Mozart will begin today
in the music room of the Art Gal
lery according to Jan Popper, asso
ciate professor of music and direc
tor of the Opera Workshop.
Tryouts today will be held at 5
p.m. and tomorrow at this time also.
Thursday and Friday they will be
held at 1 p.m.
The Stanford music department
and the Stanford Players are pre
senting this, the only opera of the
year. "The Magic Flute" oilers 16
solo parts for singers. All students,
whether enrolled in any present mu
sic course or not, are urged to try
out for these parts or one of the 45
chorus parts in the production.
No knowledge of the music of
"The Magic Flute" is needed for a
person to try out for the opera, but
tryoutees are asked to bring their
own music.
The cast will be chosen and an
nounced before the holidays. Try
outs for the orchestra will be held
at a later date, although they will be
announced at the same time as the
cast.
One of the main advantages of
being in the opera, along with gain
ing valuable experience, is that the
members of the cast are eligible to
elect Opera Workshop next quarter,
according to Dr. Popper.
