# Juniper Lodge Must 'Shrink' This Quarter
## 
### 
Juniper women made plans to
move last night as Housing Com
mittee and University officials an
nounced their decision to "shrink"
the residence this quarter in prepa
ration for its eventual return to the
Delta Upsilon fraternity. In draw
ing for rooms in other women's res
idences Juniper women will be
eiven first choice in order of their
class.
Juniper is one of three men's
residences which were converted
for women's use in fall quarter,
1044. Of the other two, Redwoods,
the former Sigma Chi house, may
possibly be reconverted at the end
of winter quarter; the future of
Branncr is still indefinite.
When women were moved into
Juniper last year, because of the
large freshman class, the University
foresaw the problem of shrinkage
and eventual return of the house to
the men. The early close of the
war, however, brought an unex
pected influx of returning veterans
and made house reconversion an im
mediate problem. Unless we start
moving undergraduate women out
of men's houses now, Administration
officials stated, we would not be
able to take in any freshman class.
Decision to shrink Juniper was
agreed upon because it is one of the
smallest houses and because house
continuity would be broken this
quarter by the departure of its res
ident assistant.
Juniper women will be allowed to
draw for rooms in pairs, or by
groups of three or four if they
choose.
