### 
'"Respiration and Fermentation in
Mammalian Tissues" will be dis
cussed by John Field 11, professor of
physiology, at the Biological Science
Department's weekly seminar this
afternoon at 4:15 in room 430 in
Jordan Hall.
Dr. Field, an alumnus of Stanford,
has done a great deal of work on di
nitrophenol, and the way and man
ner in which it stimulates respira
tion. He is aljo interested in vari
ous respiratory inhibitors as well as
muscular metabolism.
He has made experiments on the
exposure of mammalian tissues to
very low temperatures. He and oth
ers have been working on war proj
ects in regard to effects of freezing
temperatures on tissues and recov
eries.
Dr. Field has also worked on var
ious body tissues. He has found that
there is no need to invoke any su
pernatural power to explain body
respiration.
