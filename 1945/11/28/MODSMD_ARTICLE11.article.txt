# Stanford Is Yellow; Sophs Smear Quad
## 
### 
Midnight! Seven figures lurked
through the gathering fog and
stealthily crept into (he inner cav
crns of History Corner. Armed
with streamers of that color never
mentioned at the Farm, the invad
j ers began chalking up the black
| boards of the classrooms.
Quietly, swiftly, the S f, ven did
their worst. Stanford's illustrious
Quad was getting a trimming. The
glorious Cardinal was smeared with
yellow!
No, Not Cal
In the morning a sleepy - eyed
gardener plowed his way through
the mist and began raking leaves in
front of the Cellar. Suddenly lie
wiped his eyes and stared—Cal had
done it again. Then he turned,
amazed. Out into the fog plowed a
band of girls! Surely they couldn't
be Stanford women. Buckets of that
dreaded yellow paint were pro
duced, and then the gardener re
laxed. The Sophomore Class was
on the prowl.
The hour of eight approached and
2,000 Indians, oblivious (at the mo
ment) of the class of '48, began wan
dering slowly toward the Quad. In
front of them, on all sides of them
were yellow streamers. Trees, poles,
the iron gates on Quad were cov
ered with the flying paper. The 2,000
Indians looked down. "Rate with

'48" hit them in the face.
It Was Sophs!
The late risers found their way
into the Cellar and there, brazenly
staring at them, were posters bear
ing the words "Seniors, seniors ev
erywhere and not a drop to drink."
Yellow sweaters began appearing as
the "mighty sophs" took hold, on
their day, and gaily greeted each
other, "Hi, Sop/i!"
Freshmen sat down to a Western
Civ section and stared — on the
blackboards were signs proclaim
ing the class of '48 the best of all.
In psych, ccon, and poly sci classes
the sophs, with a lot of show, doffed
their coats and formed a " '48" root
ing section.
Even a New Plaque
The mysterious Seven had done
their work well. In front of the Me
morial Church there was a new
plaque. Chalked but dignified, it
announced the merits of That Class.
By 11 a.m. the sophomores were
holding their heads high, with a
"Down with '46, '47, and '49" look
on their faces. This was their hour.
The streamers were bedraggled and
the paint was wearing off, but the
| sophs were just beginning. "Rate
j with "48" was the theme of the day!
