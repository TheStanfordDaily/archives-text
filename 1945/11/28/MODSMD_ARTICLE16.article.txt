# Freshmen to Give Slag Dance Friday
## 
### 
A "Let's Get Acquainted" dance
Friday night will usher in the first
freshman activity of the year. The
dance, to be held from 7:150 to 12
p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse, will
be a strictly freshman no-date affair.
Excom and the freshman officers
hope that the dance will further
serve to introduce the newcomers to
their classmates. Music will be fur
nished by a band from Encina.
