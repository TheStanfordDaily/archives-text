## Excom Decisions 
### 
E.:com will be faced with another war-to
peace decision tonight when it considers the
petition of Phi Delta Delta, women's national
honorary legal fraternity, for recognition un
der the A.S.S.U. constitution.
T1 e fraternity was active a number of years
before the war, and an attempt is now being
made to revive it. The organization's national
consii uuon and its local charter, however, is
still rjuhjoct to Excom approval and the custo
mary four-quarter trial period before coming
an A.S.S.U.-affiliated organization.
' Not questioning the value of a legal frater
nity as such, v/e nevertheless were disturbed
to note that its national constitution includes
the following clause:
"Article 111, Section 1. Qualifications. Mem
bers of the fraternity shall be white women of
Christian faith, good character, and scholastic
ability, who are students or graduates of law
schools, or are practicing attorneys. Women
who meet all other requirements but are not
of Christian faith may be admitted to mem
bership upon the unanimous consent of the
Executive Committee."
This insertion of a religious qualification for
membership in a recognized organization ap
pears to us to be well out of line with the
policies of a democratic and free-thinking uni
versity. Regardless of the fact that the frater
nity was in operation prior to the war (there
was obligation to the clause aj that time too),
we believe that Excom has a definite respon
sibility to the cause of tolerance and under
standing in the rejection of this clause in the
fraternity constitution.
