At least once every quarter we hear the same
old song frorr. the Cellar: more walk-outs, stu
dents leaving the Cellar without paying their
bills, more and more debts piling up . . . and
on and on . . . And at least once every quarter
our estimation of the responsibility of Stanford
students is shaken, and we find ourselves con
sidering ways and means of pounding into
people's heads, or at least calling attention to
facts such as: during the week November 12
to 17 walk-outs totaled $45.05; November 19
to 24, 521.52 (the difference, obviously, be
cause Stanfordites were eating at home for a
few days instead of in the Cellar).
The problem has been brought before Excom,
where it was agreed that the matter should be
well-publicized, although Excom as does the
Daily, dislikes the assumption of any "naughty
boy - if - you - don't - pay - your - Cellar - bill,
mama - will - spank" attitude.
The facts are obvious if persons persist in
walking out without paying Cellar checks, the
Cellar may have to cut down on the number of
hours it remains open. We leave the problem
with you.
