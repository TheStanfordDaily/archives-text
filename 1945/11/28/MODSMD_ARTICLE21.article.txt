lIAIL AND FAREWELL
To the Editor:
Thi is intended as a letter of thanks to all the
people h re at Stanford who have helped make our
:-t;.y a pleasant one. Of our class, eighteen have been
h' re a full year, while the rest have had a somewhat
: isorter but nevertheless enjoyable stay. For many it
w.'.s their first visit to California, but probably not their
last. Nearly a dozen have already made arrangements
Jor re-admittance to Stanford as soon as Uncle Sam
permits. The others will undoubtedly want to make
return trips to the West Coast and to this University.
At any rate, we all appreciate the courtesies that
have been extended us. and the way that all of you
here at the Farm have helped to make us feel at
home. We have also been very much impressed by
the scenery on this beautiful campus, especially
since Army camps are decidedly 11011 -coeducational.
Here let us offer our apologies to the Civil Engi
neering Department for all the grief we must have
caused the professors. Our apologies are given to Pro
fessor Wells, whose misfortune it has been to have
the responsibility of giving us four courses in three
terms, and to his companions in misery, Professors
Williams, Peck. Oglesby, Kocal, and Young. And, too,
this letter would not be complete without an expres
sion of gratitude for you, ' Pop" Reynolds, for the swell

way you have treated us. We would also like to thank
the faculty of the other departments of the University,
especially Professors Mason, Kindy, Mumby, and
Sprague.
Back at Encina, we all appreciate the fine service,
friendly smile, and "everything for the boys" attitude
of "Blackie," the proprietor of our P.X. Many thanks
go to the faithful hashers at the mess hall, especially
to Mom and Gwenn. (And to you to, J.D., although
we would still like to swipe two bottles of milk from
under your nose —and don't think we aren't.) We
would also like to thank the new chef who has im
proved the chow tremendously.
As to our extra-curricular activities, we all can't
forget "Pop" Rossotti, whose cold "beverages" and
salami sandwiches have been welcome on many a
cold night and "hot" one. too. Also we want to
thank whoever is responsible for the poor lighting
system on the Quad. It has been in very good
taste during the wartime rationing of gas and tires.
are many others that we would like to men
tion here for their friendship and help, but the Daily
would not have room to print the list. So it is with
sincere regret that we leave Stanford. Its fine spirit,
noble traditions, impressive formals, and cozy fire
sides have made this school a place we won't forget.
Thanks again, Indians; you have been swell, and here's
hoping that we see you and the Axe soon in the Cellar.

Back at Encina, we all appreciate the fine service,

to Mom and Gwenn. (And to you to, J.D., although
we would still like to swipe two bottles of milk from
under your nose —and don't think we aren't.) We
would also like to thank the new chef who has im
proved the chow tremendously.
As to our extra-curricular activities, we all can't
forget "Pop" Rossotti, whose cold "beverages" and
salami sandwiches have been welcome on many a
cold night and "hot" one. too. Also we want to
thank whoever is responsible for the poor lighting
system on the Quad. It has been in very good
taste during the wartime rationing of gas and tires.

sincere regret that we leave Stanford. Its fine spirit,
noble traditions, impressive formals, and cozy fire

Thanks again, Indians; you have been swell, and here's
hoping that we see you and the Axe soon in the Cellar.

lIAIL AND FAREWELL
To the Editor:
Thi is intended as a letter of thanks to all the
people h re at Stanford who have helped make our
:-t;.y a pleasant one. Of our class, eighteen have been
h' re a full year, while the rest have had a somewhat
: isorter but nevertheless enjoyable stay. For many it
w.'.s their first visit to California, but probably not their
last. Nearly a dozen have already made arrangements
Jor re-admittance to Stanford as soon as Uncle Sam
permits. The others will undoubtedly want to make
return trips to the West Coast and to this University.
At any rate, we all appreciate the courtesies that
have been extended us. and the way that all of you
here at the Farm have helped to make us feel at
home. We have also been very much impressed by
the scenery on this beautiful campus, especially
since Army camps are decidedly 11011 -coeducational.
Here let us offer our apologies to the Civil Engi
neering Department for all the grief we must have
caused the professors. Our apologies are given to Pro
fessor Wells, whose misfortune it has been to have
the responsibility of giving us four courses in three
terms, and to his companions in misery, Professors
Williams, Peck. Oglesby, Kocal, and Young. And, too,
this letter would not be complete without an expres
sion of gratitude for you, ' Pop" Reynolds, for the swell

way you have treated us. We would also like to thank
the faculty of the other departments of the University,
especially Professors Mason, Kindy, Mumby, and
