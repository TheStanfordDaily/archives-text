# "CALLING ALL CARS!"

To the Editor:
On page four, column six, of last Tuesday's Daily,
you printed the following:
"Florida is the only statÂ° in the Union without a
state highway patrol system."
I have been stopped by their cream and black Mer
curys to know that one does exist. It is a subdivision
of the Florida Slate Road Department.
