I think practically everyone who heard Don Tous
saint's outstanding piano performance in the Gaieties
would have liked hearing a great deal more. How
about someone arranging a campus recital and then
approaching Mr. Toussaint with the idea? I, for one,
would be glad for an opportunity to hear more of his
fine piano work.
