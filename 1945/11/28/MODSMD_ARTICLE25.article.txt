Quote from a wire service bulletin recently:
"Maj. Charles Boxer, British army officer and
father of authoress Emily Hahn's daughter, ar
rived here today from a Jap prison camp to
make an honest woman out of Emily and give
four-year-old Carole a last name." Like I al
ways say —every child should have a father
and a last name!

I seem to be on a newspaper quote jag today,
but here's another: In column three of yester
day's Daily the actress scheduled to appear at
the rally tomorrow evening was described as
a "stately blonde," while the singer in Skinnay
Ennis' band was identified in column seven as
being "a tall, stately blonde." Can't anyone
find me a short, unco-ordinated, and obnoxious
brunette?

Recent headlines: "New Violence In Pales
tine," "Riots in Calcutta," "Anti-Semitic Riots."
It's nice to live in a v/oild of peace, isn't it?
Did someone say something about a "white
Christmas"?

We read with interest yesterday that the U.S.
troopship, "Leland Stanford," was aground for
10 hours off the English Channel coast. There
could be an analogy to this, but I won't say a
word!!

If you wish to initiate some good construc
tive thinking on a world problem, applicable
to our present society, read the front page edi
torial in yesterday's San Francisco Chronicle.
It's a little gem which blasts with success the
present dominating colonial policy practiced
in Indonesia. Advocating freedom, to a greater
degree, for the native people of Indonesia, this
editorial carries a poignant message which may
serve us well to practice. The thing your writer
liked about the edit was the fact that the theory
was one which could be made applicable to
any region, or any people.
The day of dominance and autocratic rule is
gone. The day of full or partial self-determina
tion and rule is here. Too many persons have
fought tenaciously for too much, to have it for
gotten and revert to the archaic custom of com
plete subjugation.
It is a well-known fact that the physical and
mechanical sciences have passed far ahead of
the social sciences. We must no longer cling
to traditional, ineffective, and conservative prac
tices when dealing with human beings and
their lives. Our science of politics and socio
logical consideration must reach the same level
of development which is produced in the labo
ratory before we will experience freedom from
dominance and realize international affability.
