# Voltage Talk Given Tonight
## 
### 
"A Demonstration of High-Volt
age Phenomena" will be presented
by Dr. J. S. Carroll, professor of
electrical engineering and a special
ist in the field of high-voltage re
search, tonight at 7:30 in the Ryan
High-Voltage Laboratory.
Dr. Carroll, who is being presented
by the Stanford branch of the Amer
ican Institute of Electrical Engi
neers. will give a historical sketch
of the Ryan Laboratory and will
mention high-voltage problems
solved by research conducted at
the laboratory. The voltage used
in the demonstration will be 650,-
000 volts.
Engineering students and faculty
members are invited to attend this
meeting, which is the second one
this year. Dr. Carroll's demonstra
tion will be one of the few exhibi
tions to be performed this year at
the Ryan Laboratory, a high-voltage
laboratory which is recognized as
one of the outstanding in the United
States.
