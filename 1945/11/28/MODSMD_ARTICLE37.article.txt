AL SCIARONI
Once again, the biggest news for Stanford students is the
Card-San Mateo Merchant Marine game this Saturday at 2 p.m.
Cardinal rooters will once again have the opportunity to cheer
the big red machine on, and this time on to victory.
In the last game against the Stockton Commandos the Indians
showed plenty of offensive power in the first half when they
rolled to two touchdowns, and nearly to a third one in the clos- i
ing minutes of the second quarter. During the second half the
Indians weren't in a position to show what they could do on
offense. The Commandos had control of the pigskin during
nearly all of the last half due to the defensive inability of the
Cards to take it away from them, and when Stanford did have
the ball they were so deep in their own territory that they had to ;
kick out.
This Saturday the boys should go into the game much
stronger on pass defense and tackling, and will not find them
selves again in the position which they were in their first game.
We can look forward to a victory this time behind the coaching
of Marchie Schwartz and the playing of the "Dare" boys of 1945.
CARDS PLAY BASKETBALL THURSDAY
Another sports event on the campus this week is the basket
ball game Thursday evening between Stanford and Moffett
Field. The game will be played in the Pavilion following the '
"Big Bonfire Rally."
This will be the Indians second campus exhibition match of
the season. Last week the Indians defeated the San Francisco
j Marines 37-28. The quintet is not by any means the smoothest
team that has come to Stanford, but nevertheless is good. The
game Thursday night will be good, and shouldn't be missed.
The picking of St. Mary's and Oklahoma A&M to play in
the Sugar Bowl on January 1, will probably make New Orleans
the center of sports attraction on New Year's Day.
SUGAR BOWL TOPS
The Sugar Bowl, which rates second in the nation for Bowl
games, will feature a much better game than the Rose Bowl at
Pasadena. No matter whether the Trojans of U.S.C. or the Cou
gars of Washington State are the Pacific Coast Conference rep- j
resentatives at the Rose Bowl, it will probably be an overwhelm- '
ing victory for the Crimson Tide.
St. Mary's, undoubtedly the best team on the coast even |
though they lost to U.C.L.A., will play a team of even strength
and ability. Both St. Mary's and Oklahoma A&M are offensive
minded teams. The Aggies rolled through a schedule of eight
games undefeated in which they scored 252 points. The Gaels
galloped over the same amount of teams for 269 points.
