# Cards Prepare For Saturday
## 
### 
Varsity football practice went into
high gear in preparation for Satur
day's game with the San Mateo
Merchant Marine Academy. Par
ticularly noticeable in Stanford
weakness in their first game against
Stockton was pass defense, and that
is what was stressed yesterday.
Coach Schwartz had backfield
combinations running pass plays and
working on pass defense, when not
on the offense. The grid mentor
also introduced some new plays
which ought to baffle the merchant
marine opposition no end next Sat
urday.
Fans will see a lot more passes in
the next game. Curt Burks, Stan
ford's dapper little quarterback, can
throw the pigskin second to none,
but apparently he didn't have
enough confidence in his football
heaving plays, but all that will be
cured for this game.
The same backfield combination
that started against the Stockton
Commandos will start against our
competitors from San Mateo. At the
fullback post is Fred Willey, a
powerhouse player of the first or
der. He's a little slow,, but is still
the best man for the fullback post.
Over to Willey's right will be Gene
Martin, the hefty player that caught
everybody's eye in his gridiron
debut two Saturday's ago. A very
hard runner, and a good pass snag
ger, too, he has the makings of a
great football player. At the left
back spot will be speedy Don Li
pelt. Not as powerful as his com
patriots in the T formation, he
makes up in speed what he lacks
in power plunging tactics. The field
general of the day, at the quarter
back position is Curt Burks, whose
ball handling is improving with
every practice session.
On the line, at the fianker spots
will be Ric Supple, who was game
captain at the last grid fray, and
Dave DeSwarte, an all-star from
Evanston prep circles. Bob Abrams
does the centering, and he is sur
rounded by Harry Davison, Jim
Frye, Bill Lundquist, and Harvey
Dyer, all good linesmen.
