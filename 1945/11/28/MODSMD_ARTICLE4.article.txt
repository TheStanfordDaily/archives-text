# McClelland Reads Poetry; Series Has Creole Songs
## 
### 
John McClelland, associate professor of English,
showed the contemporary reaction to l!)th century
verse in reading the poetry of W. 11. Auden and
Louis Macncice yesterday at the last poetry reading
meeting of the quarter.

Before beginning the reading, Mr.
McClelland gave some background
to the work of the two poets. Since
the first world war there has been
a tendency to dispense with the
regularity of verse. Liberties are
taken with rimes, and lines don't ap
pear to scan. Macneice and Auden
have entended the poetic vocabu
lary, and practice the use of images.
Prefers Auden
Since both Auden and Macneice
were more interested in self-expres
sion than in communication, their
poems are difficult to comprehend
at times. Although Macneice is fa
vored by literary authorities, Mr.
McClelland prefers Auden, from
whom he read the most.
Mr. McClelland began with Mac
neice, who excells in description.
The reading included "Snow";
"Morning Sun"; "Taken For
Granted"; "Autobiography," a psy
chological poem; "Bagpipe Music,"
which illustrates Macneice's fond
ness for writing in the vernacular.
This last poem is long and very
amusing.
"Bobbets of Knowledge"
Audcn's writing is considered "un
digested bobbets of knowledge" by
one of his contemporary poets. Mr.
McClelland began the reading of
Auden with the poem, "Stop all the
clocks " which he wrote for
a nightclub singer to vocalize. The
reading continued with the "Un
known Citizen," which satirizes
mechanized society; and the sonnet,
"Nobody Understands Me," about a
drcanl that Mr. McClelland didn't
understand either.
Auden went to China with another
English writer, Christopher Ishwood,
who wrote "Journey to War." Au
den contributed some sonnets to the
book. Mr. McClelland read three
of these, "They arc and suffer ....,"
about a field hospital; a sonnet about
a dead Chinese soldier, and "Wan
dering lost . . . ."
Irregular Form
Auden writes sonnet of an irregu
lar form. Mr McClelland read "The
Way" which is really two seven line
couplets. After reading "The Lucky,"
Mr. McClelland concluded with "As
I walked out one evening ....,"
which has many of Audcn's striking
images.
After the reading, Mr. McClelland
announced a continuation of the
the reading meetings would be re
sumed next quarter, Jan. 14.—Betty
Barlow.

In the hoop-skirted gowns characteristic of planta
tions in Louisiana and the French quarter of New Or
leans. Camille Lucie Nickerson interpreted Creole and
' American Negro folk music at the Tuesday Evening
Scries last night in Memorial Hall.

The first groups of Creole songs,
particularly "Ai, Suzette" and "Mal
hereu," showed the French charac
teristic of laughing at their own
sadness. "Comme 'Tit Cochon Lem
me' la Bou" illustrated the frivolity
and gay spirit of the Creoles during
Mardi Gras, the big festival of the
year.
During this first group of songs
Miss Nickerson wore a peasant
type dress with a pink and blue
print hooped skirt and an ofi'-thc
shoulder blouse with a wide lace
ruffle..
An unusual group of street vender
cries was particularly effective with
her simple appearance in a plain
pink cotton dress and sunbonnet..
First, Miss Nickerson was selling
calas, a French pastry similar to a
doughnut except that it is made
with rice.
Then she became a Latanier
man, a vendor of scrub brushes,
imploring people "to keep nice
and clean so he could sell his
brushes." And the watermelon
man shouts, "Them that got mon-'
ey, come and buy; them that don't,
sit and cry!"
The next group were "counjailles,"
gay dance tunes planned for merry
making, which featured guitar ac
companiment instead of piano as in
the previous selections. The great
rejoicing of a slave who escaped
from his cruel owner was the story
back of "Charles Roussell Embark
er."
Miss Nickerson tried to show the
differences between American Ne
gro and Creole music with her
next selections, "I'm So Glad" and
"Mah Good Lawd."
A beautiful white satin dress
trimmed with rhincstones gave a
stunning setting for "Toucoutou," a
song of the suitor of a beautiful girl
who has refused his offer of mar
riage. "Fais Do .Do," a lullaby with
accompaniment by Herbert Jan
Popper, associate professor of mu
sic, gave a simple, dignified ending
to the collection of Creole songs,
all if which were sung in their na
tive language.—Schultz

Mardi Gras, the big festival of the
year.
During this first group of songs
Miss Nickerson wore a peasant
type dress with a pink and blue
print hooped skirt and an ofi'-thc
shoulder blouse with a wide lace
ruffle..
An unusual group of street vender
cries was particularly effective with
her simple appearance in a plain
pink cotton dress and sunbonnet..
First, Miss Nickerson was selling
calas, a French pastry similar to a
doughnut except that it is made
with rice.
Then she became a Latanier
man, a vendor of scrub brushes,
imploring people "to keep nice
and clean so he could sell his
brushes." And the watermelon
man shouts, "Them that got mon-'
ey, come and buy; them that don't,
sit and cry!"
The next group were "counjailles,"
gay dance tunes planned for merry
making, which featured guitar ac
companiment instead of piano as in
the previous selections. The great
rejoicing of a slave who escaped
from his cruel owner was the story
back of "Charles Roussell Embark
er."
Miss Nickerson tried to show the
differences between American Ne
gro and Creole music with her
next selections, "I'm So Glad" and
"Mah Good Lawd."
A beautiful white satin dress
trimmed with rhincstones gave a
stunning setting for "Toucoutou," a
song of the suitor of a beautiful girl
who has refused his offer of mar
riage. "Fais Do .Do," a lullaby with
accompaniment by Herbert Jan
Popper, associate professor of mu
sic, gave a simple, dignified ending
to the collection of Creole songs,
all if which were sung in their na
tive language.—Schultz
John McClelland, associate professor of English,
showed the contemporary reaction to l!)th century
verse in reading the poetry of W. 11. Auden and
Louis Macncice yesterday at the last poetry reading
meeting of the quarter.

Before beginning the reading, Mr.
McClelland gave some background
to the work of the two poets. Since
the first world war there has been
a tendency to dispense with the
regularity of verse. Liberties are
taken with rimes, and lines don't ap
pear to scan. Macneice and Auden
have entended the poetic vocabu
lary, and practice the use of images.
Prefers Auden
Since both Auden and Macneice
were more interested in self-expres
sion than in communication, their
poems are difficult to comprehend
at times. Although Macneice is fa
vored by literary authorities, Mr.
McClelland prefers Auden, from
whom he read the most.
Mr. McClelland began with Mac
neice, who excells in description.
The reading included "Snow";
"Morning Sun"; "Taken For
Granted"; "Autobiography," a psy
chological poem; "Bagpipe Music,"
which illustrates Macneice's fond
ness for writing in the vernacular.
This last poem is long and very
amusing.
"Bobbets of Knowledge"
Audcn's writing is considered "un
digested bobbets of knowledge" by
one of his contemporary poets. Mr.
McClelland began the reading of
Auden with the poem, "Stop all the
clocks " which he wrote for
a nightclub singer to vocalize. The
reading continued with the "Un
known Citizen," which satirizes
mechanized society; and the sonnet,
"Nobody Understands Me," about a
drcanl that Mr. McClelland didn't
understand either.
Auden went to China with another
English writer, Christopher Ishwood,
who wrote "Journey to War." Au
den contributed some sonnets to the
book. Mr. McClelland read three
of these, "They arc and suffer ....,"
about a field hospital; a sonnet about
a dead Chinese soldier, and "Wan
dering lost . . . ."
Irregular Form
Auden writes sonnet of an irregu
lar form. Mr McClelland read "The
Way" which is really two seven line
couplets. After reading "The Lucky,"
Mr. McClelland concluded with "As
I walked out one evening ....,"
which has many of Audcn's striking
images.
After the reading, Mr. McClelland
announced a continuation of the
the reading meetings would be re
sumed next quarter, Jan. 14.—Betty

one of his contemporary poets. Mr.
McClelland began the reading of
Auden with the poem, "Stop all the
clocks " which he wrote for
a nightclub singer to vocalize. The
reading continued with the "Un
known Citizen," which satirizes
mechanized society; and the sonnet,
"Nobody Understands Me," about a
drcanl that Mr. McClelland didn't
understand either.
Auden went to China with another
English writer, Christopher Ishwood,
who wrote "Journey to War." Au
den contributed some sonnets to the
book. Mr. McClelland read three
of these, "They arc and suffer ....,"
about a field hospital; a sonnet about
a dead Chinese soldier, and "Wan
dering lost . . . ."
Irregular Form
Auden writes sonnet of an irregu
lar form. Mr McClelland read "The
Way" which is really two seven line
couplets. After reading "The Lucky,"
Mr. McClelland concluded with "As
I walked out one evening ....,"
which has many of Audcn's striking
images.
After the reading, Mr. McClelland
announced a continuation of the
the reading meetings would be re
sumed next quarter, Jan. 14.—Betty

In the hoop-skirted gowns characteristic of planta

leans. Camille Lucie Nickerson interpreted Creole and
' American Negro folk music at the Tuesday Evening
Scries last night in Memorial Hall.

The first groups of Creole songs,
particularly "Ai, Suzette" and "Mal
hereu," showed the French charac
teristic of laughing at their own
sadness. "Comme 'Tit Cochon Lem
me' la Bou" illustrated the frivolity
and gay spirit of the Creoles during
Mardi Gras, the big festival of the
year.
During this first group of songs
Miss Nickerson wore a peasant
type dress with a pink and blue
print hooped skirt and an ofi'-thc
shoulder blouse with a wide lace
ruffle..
An unusual group of street vender
cries was particularly effective with
her simple appearance in a plain
pink cotton dress and sunbonnet..
First, Miss Nickerson was selling
calas, a French pastry similar to a
doughnut except that it is made
with rice.
Then she became a Latanier
man, a vendor of scrub brushes,
imploring people "to keep nice
and clean so he could sell his
brushes." And the watermelon
man shouts, "Them that got mon-'
ey, come and buy; them that don't,
sit and cry!"
The next group were "counjailles,"
gay dance tunes planned for merry
making, which featured guitar ac
companiment instead of piano as in
the previous selections. The great
rejoicing of a slave who escaped
from his cruel owner was the story
back of "Charles Roussell Embark
er."
Miss Nickerson tried to show the
differences between American Ne
gro and Creole music with her
next selections, "I'm So Glad" and
"Mah Good Lawd."
A beautiful white satin dress
trimmed with rhincstones gave a
stunning setting for "Toucoutou," a
song of the suitor of a beautiful girl
who has refused his offer of mar
riage. "Fais Do .Do," a lullaby with
accompaniment by Herbert Jan
Popper, associate professor of mu
sic, gave a simple, dignified ending
to the collection of Creole songs,
all if which were sung in their na
tive language.—Schultz
John McClelland, associate professor of English,
showed the contemporary reaction to l!)th century
verse in reading the poetry of W. 11. Auden and
Louis Macncice yesterday at the last poetry reading
meeting of the quarter.

Before beginning the reading, Mr.
McClelland gave some background
to the work of the two poets. Since
the first world war there has been
a tendency to dispense with the
regularity of verse. Liberties are
taken with rimes, and lines don't ap
pear to scan. Macneice and Auden
have entended the poetic vocabu
lary, and practice the use of images.
Prefers Auden
Since both Auden and Macneice
were more interested in self-expres
sion than in communication, their
poems are difficult to comprehend
at times. Although Macneice is fa
vored by literary authorities, Mr.
McClelland prefers Auden, from
whom he read the most.
Mr. McClelland began with Mac
neice, who excells in description.
The reading included "Snow";
"Morning Sun"; "Taken For
Granted"; "Autobiography," a psy
chological poem; "Bagpipe Music,"
which illustrates Macneice's fond
ness for writing in the vernacular.
This last poem is long and very
amusing.
