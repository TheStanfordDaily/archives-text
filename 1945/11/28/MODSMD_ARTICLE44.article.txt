### 
With the second game of the sea
son drawing nearer, Coach Everett
Dean's 1945-46 Indian basketball
team played host to the San Bruno
Navy outfit last night in a long j
scrimmage. The Stanford quintet
was on top after two hours of free
scoring.
The Navy aggregation was led by
John "Brooms" Abramovich, former
All - American basketballer from
West Virginia U. who broke Hank
Luisetti's scoring record a few years !
back. It was good practice for the
boys to play against such top flight
competition as this," stated Dean
Abramovich swished through 21
points for the visitors. Chilson
bucketed 17 to top the locals. Hood !
and Hill followed with 9 each.
Nothing has been heard from Mof
fett Field concerning its team yet,
but grapevine reports have it
stocked with some classy college
ball players. All indications point
toward a hot contest this Thursday
night at the Pavilion. Game time is
8 p.m.
Coach Dean announced yesterday
that the starting lineup for the game
will be Jim Hill and Paul Chilson
at forwards, Max King or Bill O'-
Brien at center, and Tom Rodman
and Bill Christianson at guards.
King and O'Brien are still fighting
it out for the pivot position and
Dean probably won't make his
choice until the last minute.
The junior varsity will also play
Thursday night against the Moffett
J.V.'s. Dean has been shuffling this
squad continuously and there is no
definite starting lineup. Ehrlich,
Lamb, Lefcourt, Fox, and Wood
started the last game, but some of
these boys may not be in at the
opening whistle which will be at
6:30 p.m.
