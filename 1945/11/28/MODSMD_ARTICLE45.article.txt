# Barker Reviews Causes Affecting Maladjustment
## 
### BETTY TALBOT 
"Physically disabled people are
often maladjusted in some way," said
Dr. Roger G. Barker, associate pro
fessor of psychology and education.
"They arc antagonized, and often iso
lated and ostracized because they are
unable to compete with able-bodied
people. This is particularly true in
vocational fields where employers
would rather hire men who can adapt
themselves to new jobs more quickly
than disabled men can."
Dr. Barker has been making a sur
vey of the literature about malad
justed cripples to find anything that
will aid in the rehabilitation of dis
abled veterans. "But there is prac
tically nothing written on veterans of
the first World War," he said, "and
that is what we are particularly in
terested in."
British Try Experiment
He added that physically disabled
people arc at a disadvantage because
they are not flexible in learning a
new job. If a blind man is trained to
do one particular job well, and
through advances in machinery, it
becomes no longer necessary for him
to do that job, it is very difficult for

him to learn to do something else.
When Dr. Barker was asked what
could be done for these people to
better fit them for competing with
others, he replied that the British
are trying an interesting experiment
by requiring employers to keep a
certain percentage of disabled work
ers on thir payrolls, thus cutting
down the competition between dis
abled and able people. As this has
been in practice only a few months,
it is not clear how it will work out,
but it will be interesting to keep
track of it.
Not All Maladjusted
In this country there has been
some action to include cripples in
the Fair Employment Practices bill
before Congress. Specialized train
ing is an important part of the pro
gram of rehabilitation for disabled
people. "The State Board of Re
habilitation," Dr. Barker added, "is
doing a good job of counseling and
training cripples. It helps anyone
over 1(5 who is physically disabled.
There are 150 students at the Uni
versity of California whose expenses
are paid by the board."
Dr. Barker made it clear that not
all physically disabled people arc
maladjusted. There are many that
arc well-adjusted socially and vo
cationally, but there is a general
tendency for them to have certain
difficulties. He explained that this
was often caused by over-protec
tion or rejection in childhood. Vet
erans will eventually be "in the same
boat as those crippled from child
hood."
Dr. Barker is leaving Stanford
soon to teach and continue his re
search at Clark University in Mas
sachusetts. He received the Ph.D.
degree here in 1934, and has been
teaching here since 1942.

Not All Maladjusted
In this country there has been
some action to include cripples in
the Fair Employment Practices bill
before Congress. Specialized train
ing is an important part of the pro
gram of rehabilitation for disabled
people. "The State Board of Re
habilitation," Dr. Barker added, "is
doing a good job of counseling and
training cripples. It helps anyone
over 1(5 who is physically disabled.
There are 150 students at the Uni
versity of California whose expenses
are paid by the board."
Dr. Barker made it clear that not
all physically disabled people arc
maladjusted. There are many that
arc well-adjusted socially and vo
cationally, but there is a general
tendency for them to have certain
difficulties. He explained that this
was often caused by over-protec
tion or rejection in childhood. Vet
erans will eventually be "in the same
boat as those crippled from child
hood."
Dr. Barker is leaving Stanford
soon to teach and continue his re
search at Clark University in Mas
sachusetts. He received the Ph.D.
degree here in 1934, and has been
teaching here since 1942.
"Physically disabled people are
often maladjusted in some way," said
Dr. Roger G. Barker, associate pro
fessor of psychology and education.
"They arc antagonized, and often iso
lated and ostracized because they are
unable to compete with able-bodied
people. This is particularly true in
vocational fields where employers
would rather hire men who can adapt
themselves to new jobs more quickly
than disabled men can."
Dr. Barker has been making a sur
vey of the literature about malad
justed cripples to find anything that
will aid in the rehabilitation of dis
abled veterans. "But there is prac
tically nothing written on veterans of
the first World War," he said, "and
that is what we are particularly in
terested in."
British Try Experiment
He added that physically disabled
people arc at a disadvantage because
they are not flexible in learning a
new job. If a blind man is trained to
do one particular job well, and
through advances in machinery, it
becomes no longer necessary for him
to do that job, it is very difficult for

him to learn to do something else.
When Dr. Barker was asked what
could be done for these people to
better fit them for competing with
others, he replied that the British
are trying an interesting experiment
by requiring employers to keep a
certain percentage of disabled work
ers on thir payrolls, thus cutting
down the competition between dis
abled and able people. As this has
been in practice only a few months,
it is not clear how it will work out,
but it will be interesting to keep
track of it.
