# 'Rounded Education' Favored
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON GEORGE BRUNN 
A "well - rounded education"
rather than specialized training
was advocated as preparation for
a career in most businesses by top
management officials of five East
Bay concerns interviewed by two
Daily reporters in the second day
of a tour sponsored by the Nation
al Association of Manufacturers.
An exception mentioned was tech
nical industry which demands
trained chcmists and physicists.
Included in the tour conducted
under the supervision of Daniel T.
Cavanagh, assistant to N.A.M.'s West
Coast manager, were the General
Electric apparatus plant in Oakland,
the California Container Corpora
tion in Emeryvilc, the 11. C. Capwell
Company department storo in Oak
land, and tlie Standard Oil of Cali
fornia refinery and Research Corpo
ration in Richmond.
Liberal Arts
A liberal arts education—similar
to the program recently proposed
by Stanford authorities—was rec
ommended b,v It. 11. Biggs, vice
president of Emporium - Capwell
and manager of 11. C. Capwell de
partment store, as desirable train
ing for success in merchandising
and management careers. Mr.
Biggs, with whom the reporters
from Stanford, California and San
Jose State lunched in the tearoom
of 11. C. Capwell, mentioned (he
value of English, public speaking
and general language training for
positions in advertising, selling
and buying.
Even the companies which re
quire high skill for research—such
as that at General Electric and Cali
fornia Research—commented on the
necessity of effective speech and
good English usage.
Personality Stressed
Will Evans, vice-president and
general manager of California Con
tainer Corporation, and his assistant
D. B. Pooley remarked especially
upon the desirability of outside ac
tivities such as committee work, stu
dent publications, and athletics in
building character traits essential to
executive positions. Mr. Evans em
phasized concentration on the fun
damentals of learning. He stated
that many college graduate women
who applied to him for secretarial
positions did not know even the
simplest fractional arithmetic.
Although granting that a college
degree was an asset, all admitted
that personality was a more im
portant factor in getting and hold
ing a job. Commenting on the
frequent confusion of college stu
dents about their future careers,
both Mr. Biggs and Mr. Evans ad
vised them to select an objective
early— k 'the earlier, the better."
Early Objectives i.elp
In this way they can acquire prac
tice during vacations and direct
their studies and extra-curricular
activities toward their main inter
est while keeping them sufficiently
broad for a liberal education.
General Electric, which hires
graduates at both the B.S. (or A.8.)
and Ph.D. levels, is opposed to over
specialization. Robert O. Brosemer,
assistant district engineer and in
charge of college hiring, said that
the company did not want engineer
ing students to narrow their fields to
mechanical, electrical, or chemical
engineering. Similarly, students in
terested in managerial or sales work
should not specialize too much. "We
prefer to train men and women in

our own schools," he said.
Optimistic Views
A. L. Lyman, director of Califor
nia Research Corporation, a sub
sidiary of Standard Oil of California,
recommended a combination of bus
iness and science courses as prepa
ration for administrative work.
The officials, leading business
men of northern California, ap
peared to take a cautiously opti
mistic attitude in their predictions
and plans for the future. Al
though companies in the paper in
dustry, such as Crown Zellerbach
Corporation, interviewed Monday,
and California Container Coi posi
tion, today, expect the paper
shortage to restrict their output
for as much as two years, present
plans of almost all concerns call
for considerable expansion both in
production and personnel.
G.E. Plans
Raymond M. Alvord, commercial
vice-president of General Electric,
explained that by the middle of 1946
G.E. intends to increase its present
employment of 2000 in California by
20 to 25 per cent. "This does not in
clude the increase which will result
from the new plants at San Jose
and Anaheim, plans for which arc
now being completed," he said.
'"The G.E. Oakland Lamp Works
alone will require 40 per- cent more
employees when it has changed avev
to full civilian production."
Mr. Brosemer mentioned that the
total industry demand for small ru
ral transformers which the student
reporters saw being manufactured
in the Oakland plant will be more
than twice as high as the peacetime
average of 1939.
Expansion Programs
While touring the modern labora
tories of California Research Cor
poration, the reporters heard of
Standard Oil of California's plans to
spend $37,000,000 for new const ruc

tion in California and $13,000,000 for
five new tankers.
Adolph A. Schumann, president
of Lilli-Ann Manufacturing Coiji
pany, explained that the clothing
industries of San Francisco will
center their production activities
i in the "Apparel City" now under
construction on the Bayshorc
Highway, seven minutes from the
city. This will help, he said, to
make San Francisco the third
largest clothing city in the United
States, outranking Chicago and
behind only New York and Los
Angeles.
And More Expansion
Oakland's H. C. Capwell depart
ment store plans to add 80.000 feet
of floor space. R. H. Biggs, manager,
explained that the store was built
I in 1929 witli an expected business
lof $10,000,000 annually. It is now
doing twice that much. According to
Mr. Biggs' estimates, the annual vol
ume is not likely to fall below $15.-
000,000, necessitating the expansion,
j Hugh Gallagher, vice-president of
Matson Shipping Lines, and Charles
I Wheeler, vice-president of Pope and
Talbot Shipping and Lumber Com
pany, pointed to opportunities in the
Pacific with its permanent military
bases, and 'new markets in Hawaii,
the Philippines, and China.
But . . .
These relatively rosy visions

were somewhat jarred by Cali
fornia Container Corporation's
Will Kvans who declared that "if
lahor would see the handwriting
on the wall, and work instead of
strike, prosperity in this country
would he greater than ever he
fore."
"However, if labor pursues its
present short-sighted policy, they
may well bring about a recession,"
he said.
California Container Corporation
is now engaged in union negotia
tions.

five new tankers.
Adolph A. Schumann, president
of Lilli-Ann Manufacturing Coiji
pany, explained that the clothing
industries of San Francisco will
center their production activities
i in the "Apparel City" now under
construction on the Bayshorc
Highway, seven minutes from the
city. This will help, he said, to
make San Francisco the third
largest clothing city in the United
States, outranking Chicago and
behind only New York and Los
Angeles.
And More Expansion
Oakland's H. C. Capwell depart
ment store plans to add 80.000 feet
of floor space. R. H. Biggs, manager,
explained that the store was built
I in 1929 witli an expected business
lof $10,000,000 annually. It is now
doing twice that much. According to
Mr. Biggs' estimates, the annual vol
ume is not likely to fall below $15.-
000,000, necessitating the expansion,
j Hugh Gallagher, vice-president of
Matson Shipping Lines, and Charles
I Wheeler, vice-president of Pope and
Talbot Shipping and Lumber Com
pany, pointed to opportunities in the
Pacific with its permanent military
bases, and 'new markets in Hawaii,
the Philippines, and China.
But . . .
These relatively rosy visions

were somewhat jarred by Cali
fornia Container Corporation's
Will Kvans who declared that "if
lahor would see the handwriting
on the wall, and work instead of
strike, prosperity in this country
would he greater than ever he
fore."
"However, if labor pursues its
present short-sighted policy, they
may well bring about a recession,"
he said.
California Container Corporation
is now engaged in union negotia
tions.
A "well - rounded education"
rather than specialized training
was advocated as preparation for
a career in most businesses by top
management officials of five East
Bay concerns interviewed by two
Daily reporters in the second day
of a tour sponsored by the Nation
al Association of Manufacturers.
An exception mentioned was tech
nical industry which demands
trained chcmists and physicists.
Included in the tour conducted
under the supervision of Daniel T.
Cavanagh, assistant to N.A.M.'s West
Coast manager, were the General
Electric apparatus plant in Oakland,
the California Container Corpora
tion in Emeryvilc, the 11. C. Capwell
Company department storo in Oak
land, and tlie Standard Oil of Cali
fornia refinery and Research Corpo
ration in Richmond.
Liberal Arts
A liberal arts education—similar
to the program recently proposed
by Stanford authorities—was rec
ommended b,v It. 11. Biggs, vice
president of Emporium - Capwell
and manager of 11. C. Capwell de
partment store, as desirable train
ing for success in merchandising
and management careers. Mr.
Biggs, with whom the reporters
from Stanford, California and San
Jose State lunched in the tearoom
of 11. C. Capwell, mentioned (he
value of English, public speaking
and general language training for
positions in advertising, selling
and buying.
Even the companies which re
quire high skill for research—such
as that at General Electric and Cali
fornia Research—commented on the
necessity of effective speech and
good English usage.
Personality Stressed
Will Evans, vice-president and
general manager of California Con
tainer Corporation, and his assistant
D. B. Pooley remarked especially
upon the desirability of outside ac
tivities such as committee work, stu
dent publications, and athletics in
building character traits essential to
executive positions. Mr. Evans em
phasized concentration on the fun
damentals of learning. He stated
that many college graduate women
who applied to him for secretarial
positions did not know even the
simplest fractional arithmetic.
Although granting that a college
degree was an asset, all admitted
that personality was a more im
portant factor in getting and hold
ing a job. Commenting on the
frequent confusion of college stu
dents about their future careers,
both Mr. Biggs and Mr. Evans ad
vised them to select an objective
early— k 'the earlier, the better."
Early Objectives i.elp
In this way they can acquire prac
tice during vacations and direct
their studies and extra-curricular
activities toward their main inter
est while keeping them sufficiently
broad for a liberal education.
General Electric, which hires
graduates at both the B.S. (or A.8.)
and Ph.D. levels, is opposed to over
specialization. Robert O. Brosemer,
assistant district engineer and in
charge of college hiring, said that
the company did not want engineer
ing students to narrow their fields to
mechanical, electrical, or chemical
engineering. Similarly, students in
terested in managerial or sales work
should not specialize too much. "We
prefer to train men and women in

our own schools," he said.
Optimistic Views
A. L. Lyman, director of Califor
nia Research Corporation, a sub
sidiary of Standard Oil of California,
recommended a combination of bus
iness and science courses as prepa
ration for administrative work.
The officials, leading business
men of northern California, ap
peared to take a cautiously opti
mistic attitude in their predictions
and plans for the future. Al
though companies in the paper in
dustry, such as Crown Zellerbach
Corporation, interviewed Monday,
and California Container Coi posi
tion, today, expect the paper
shortage to restrict their output
for as much as two years, present
plans of almost all concerns call
for considerable expansion both in
production and personnel.
G.E. Plans
Raymond M. Alvord, commercial
vice-president of General Electric,
explained that by the middle of 1946
G.E. intends to increase its present
employment of 2000 in California by
20 to 25 per cent. "This does not in
clude the increase which will result
from the new plants at San Jose
and Anaheim, plans for which arc
now being completed," he said.
'"The G.E. Oakland Lamp Works
alone will require 40 per- cent more
employees when it has changed avev
to full civilian production."
Mr. Brosemer mentioned that the
total industry demand for small ru
ral transformers which the student
reporters saw being manufactured
in the Oakland plant will be more
than twice as high as the peacetime
average of 1939.

mechanical, electrical, or chemical
engineering. Similarly, students in
terested in managerial or sales work
should not specialize too much. "We
prefer to train men and women in

our own schools," he said.
Optimistic Views
A. L. Lyman, director of Califor
nia Research Corporation, a sub
sidiary of Standard Oil of California,
recommended a combination of bus
iness and science courses as prepa
ration for administrative work.
The officials, leading business
men of northern California, ap
peared to take a cautiously opti
mistic attitude in their predictions
and plans for the future. Al
though companies in the paper in
dustry, such as Crown Zellerbach
Corporation, interviewed Monday,
and California Container Coi posi
tion, today, expect the paper
shortage to restrict their output
for as much as two years, present
plans of almost all concerns call
for considerable expansion both in
production and personnel.
G.E. Plans
Raymond M. Alvord, commercial
vice-president of General Electric,
explained that by the middle of 1946
G.E. intends to increase its present
employment of 2000 in California by
20 to 25 per cent. "This does not in
clude the increase which will result
from the new plants at San Jose
and Anaheim, plans for which arc
now being completed," he said.
'"The G.E. Oakland Lamp Works
alone will require 40 per- cent more
employees when it has changed avev
to full civilian production."
Mr. Brosemer mentioned that the
total industry demand for small ru
ral transformers which the student
reporters saw being manufactured
in the Oakland plant will be more
than twice as high as the peacetime
average of 1939.
Expansion Programs
While touring the modern labora
tories of California Research Cor
poration, the reporters heard of
Standard Oil of California's plans to
spend $37,000,000 for new const ruc

tion in California and $13,000,000 for
five new tankers.
Adolph A. Schumann, president
of Lilli-Ann Manufacturing Coiji
pany, explained that the clothing
industries of San Francisco will
center their production activities
i in the "Apparel City" now under
construction on the Bayshorc
Highway, seven minutes from the
city. This will help, he said, to
make San Francisco the third
largest clothing city in the United
States, outranking Chicago and
behind only New York and Los
Angeles.
And More Expansion
Oakland's H. C. Capwell depart
ment store plans to add 80.000 feet
of floor space. R. H. Biggs, manager,
explained that the store was built
I in 1929 witli an expected business
lof $10,000,000 annually. It is now
doing twice that much. According to
Mr. Biggs' estimates, the annual vol
ume is not likely to fall below $15.-
000,000, necessitating the expansion,
j Hugh Gallagher, vice-president of
Matson Shipping Lines, and Charles
I Wheeler, vice-president of Pope and
Talbot Shipping and Lumber Com
pany, pointed to opportunities in the
Pacific with its permanent military
bases, and 'new markets in Hawaii,
the Philippines, and China.
But . . .
These relatively rosy visions

were somewhat jarred by Cali
fornia Container Corporation's
Will Kvans who declared that "if
lahor would see the handwriting
on the wall, and work instead of
strike, prosperity in this country
would he greater than ever he
fore."
"However, if labor pursues its
present short-sighted policy, they
may well bring about a recession,"
he said.
California Container Corporation
is now engaged in union negotia
tions.
A "well - rounded education"
rather than specialized training
was advocated as preparation for
a career in most businesses by top
management officials of five East
Bay concerns interviewed by two
Daily reporters in the second day
of a tour sponsored by the Nation
al Association of Manufacturers.
An exception mentioned was tech
nical industry which demands
trained chcmists and physicists.
Included in the tour conducted
under the supervision of Daniel T.
Cavanagh, assistant to N.A.M.'s West
Coast manager, were the General
Electric apparatus plant in Oakland,
the California Container Corpora
tion in Emeryvilc, the 11. C. Capwell
Company department storo in Oak
land, and tlie Standard Oil of Cali
fornia refinery and Research Corpo
ration in Richmond.
Liberal Arts
A liberal arts education—similar
to the program recently proposed
by Stanford authorities—was rec
ommended b,v It. 11. Biggs, vice
president of Emporium - Capwell
and manager of 11. C. Capwell de
partment store, as desirable train
ing for success in merchandising
and management careers. Mr.
Biggs, with whom the reporters
from Stanford, California and San
Jose State lunched in the tearoom
of 11. C. Capwell, mentioned (he
value of English, public speaking
and general language training for
positions in advertising, selling
and buying.
Even the companies which re
quire high skill for research—such
as that at General Electric and Cali
fornia Research—commented on the
necessity of effective speech and
good English usage.
Personality Stressed
Will Evans, vice-president and
general manager of California Con
tainer Corporation, and his assistant
D. B. Pooley remarked especially
upon the desirability of outside ac
tivities such as committee work, stu
dent publications, and athletics in
building character traits essential to
executive positions. Mr. Evans em
phasized concentration on the fun
damentals of learning. He stated
that many college graduate women
who applied to him for secretarial
positions did not know even the
simplest fractional arithmetic.
Although granting that a college
degree was an asset, all admitted
that personality was a more im
portant factor in getting and hold
ing a job. Commenting on the
frequent confusion of college stu
dents about their future careers,
both Mr. Biggs and Mr. Evans ad
vised them to select an objective
early— k 'the earlier, the better."
Early Objectives i.elp
In this way they can acquire prac
tice during vacations and direct
their studies and extra-curricular
activities toward their main inter
est while keeping them sufficiently
broad for a liberal education.
General Electric, which hires
graduates at both the B.S. (or A.8.)
and Ph.D. levels, is opposed to over
specialization. Robert O. Brosemer,
assistant district engineer and in
charge of college hiring, said that
the company did not want engineer

and management careers. Mr.
Biggs, with whom the reporters
from Stanford, California and San
Jose State lunched in the tearoom
of 11. C. Capwell, mentioned (he
value of English, public speaking
and general language training for
positions in advertising, selling
and buying.
Even the companies which re
quire high skill for research—such
as that at General Electric and Cali
fornia Research—commented on the
necessity of effective speech and
good English usage.
Personality Stressed
Will Evans, vice-president and
general manager of California Con
tainer Corporation, and his assistant
D. B. Pooley remarked especially
upon the desirability of outside ac
tivities such as committee work, stu
dent publications, and athletics in
building character traits essential to
executive positions. Mr. Evans em
phasized concentration on the fun
damentals of learning. He stated
that many college graduate women
who applied to him for secretarial
positions did not know even the
simplest fractional arithmetic.
Although granting that a college
degree was an asset, all admitted
that personality was a more im
portant factor in getting and hold
ing a job. Commenting on the
frequent confusion of college stu
dents about their future careers,
both Mr. Biggs and Mr. Evans ad
vised them to select an objective
early— k 'the earlier, the better."
Early Objectives i.elp
In this way they can acquire prac
tice during vacations and direct
their studies and extra-curricular
activities toward their main inter
est while keeping them sufficiently
broad for a liberal education.
General Electric, which hires
graduates at both the B.S. (or A.8.)
and Ph.D. levels, is opposed to over
specialization. Robert O. Brosemer,
assistant district engineer and in
charge of college hiring, said that
the company did not want engineer
ing students to narrow their fields to
mechanical, electrical, or chemical
engineering. Similarly, students in
terested in managerial or sales work
should not specialize too much. "We
prefer to train men and women in

our own schools," he said.
Optimistic Views
A. L. Lyman, director of Califor
nia Research Corporation, a sub
sidiary of Standard Oil of California,
recommended a combination of bus
iness and science courses as prepa
ration for administrative work.
The officials, leading business
men of northern California, ap
peared to take a cautiously opti
mistic attitude in their predictions
and plans for the future. Al
though companies in the paper in
dustry, such as Crown Zellerbach
Corporation, interviewed Monday,
and California Container Coi posi
tion, today, expect the paper
shortage to restrict their output
for as much as two years, present
plans of almost all concerns call
for considerable expansion both in
production and personnel.
G.E. Plans
Raymond M. Alvord, commercial
vice-president of General Electric,
explained that by the middle of 1946
G.E. intends to increase its present
employment of 2000 in California by
20 to 25 per cent. "This does not in
clude the increase which will result
from the new plants at San Jose
and Anaheim, plans for which arc
now being completed," he said.
'"The G.E. Oakland Lamp Works
alone will require 40 per- cent more
employees when it has changed avev
to full civilian production."
Mr. Brosemer mentioned that the
total industry demand for small ru
ral transformers which the student
reporters saw being manufactured
in the Oakland plant will be more
than twice as high as the peacetime
average of 1939.
Expansion Programs
While touring the modern labora
tories of California Research Cor
poration, the reporters heard of
Standard Oil of California's plans to
spend $37,000,000 for new const ruc

tion in California and $13,000,000 for
five new tankers.
Adolph A. Schumann, president
of Lilli-Ann Manufacturing Coiji
pany, explained that the clothing
industries of San Francisco will
center their production activities
i in the "Apparel City" now under
construction on the Bayshorc
Highway, seven minutes from the
city. This will help, he said, to
make San Francisco the third
largest clothing city in the United
States, outranking Chicago and
behind only New York and Los
Angeles.
And More Expansion
Oakland's H. C. Capwell depart
ment store plans to add 80.000 feet
of floor space. R. H. Biggs, manager,
explained that the store was built
I in 1929 witli an expected business
lof $10,000,000 annually. It is now
doing twice that much. According to
Mr. Biggs' estimates, the annual vol
ume is not likely to fall below $15.-
000,000, necessitating the expansion,
j Hugh Gallagher, vice-president of
Matson Shipping Lines, and Charles
I Wheeler, vice-president of Pope and
Talbot Shipping and Lumber Com
pany, pointed to opportunities in the
Pacific with its permanent military
bases, and 'new markets in Hawaii,
the Philippines, and China.
But . . .
These relatively rosy visions

were somewhat jarred by Cali
fornia Container Corporation's
Will Kvans who declared that "if
lahor would see the handwriting
on the wall, and work instead of
strike, prosperity in this country
would he greater than ever he
fore."
"However, if labor pursues its
present short-sighted policy, they
may well bring about a recession,"
he said.
California Container Corporation
is now engaged in union negotia
tions.
