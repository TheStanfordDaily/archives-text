# Russ Drama Opening Set For Tonight
## Period Costumes Highlight Moods Of 'The Sea Gull' 
### 
The great Russian tragedy "The
Sea Gull," by Peter Chekhov, will
begin its six-day run tonight with
a performance at 8:15 in the Little
Theater. All tickets were sold out
weeks before opening night, and
even the extra performance sched
uled for Tuesday night failed to ac
commodate the great demand for
tickets, according to F. Cowles
Strickland, director.
James Clancy, an advanced stu
dent in drama and director of dra
matics at San Jose State College,
will star in the leading role of
Tregorin with Barbara Welch as
Arcadina. These roles were taken
by Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fon
tannc in the Theater Guild's pro
duction of the play.
All the members of the cast are
experienced players of senior or
graduate standing, Mr. Strickland
said. Another San Jose State Col
lege man, William Melton, plays the
young author Preplev, in love with
Nina (Patricia Nielsen). Lorna Rob
ertson as Masha, who is in love with
Preplev, further complicates the
many interplots of the story.
Hal Campbell plays Arcadina's
brother Sorin, with Walter Palance
as the country doctor, Dorin. Rol
lin Buckman will portray the man
ager of the estate, with Marjorie
Walsh as his wife. In the support
ing cast are Wendell Cole, Janice
Swan, and Charles Smurr.
Unusual costuming will he one
of the highlights of the play. Mrs.
Muriel B. Lievsay, costume direc
tor, and her staff have outdone
themselves in making costumes
authentic for the period of (he
18f)0's. The dresses stress the bal
loon sleeves typical of that pe
riod. while the suits of the men
show the narrow lapels and trou
sers then fashionable. Many of
the more ornate costumes are gifts
to the drama department, but
much of the elaborate hand em
broidery work is the personal ac
complishment of Mrs. Lievsay's
staff.
The dresses vary in richness and
mood from the strikingly beautiful
dresses of Miss Welch and Miss
Nielsen to the dark, sober costumes
of Miss Robertson. The women's
skirts show the straight line in the
front and the fullness in the back
characteristic of that period.
Hats for "The Sea Gull" have
been fashioned from modern as
well as old-fashioned hats. Even
the shoes with their narrow,
pointed toes are authentic in ev
ery detail.
