# Frosh to Give Dance Friday
## 
### 
It's on the house, frosh!
The first all-freshman activity of
the year, a "Let's Get Acquainted"
dance to be held from 8 to 11:30 p.m.
tomorrow in the Women's Club
house, is a no-datc, no-admission
get-together.
If you've been dying to meet that
cute blonde in your Civ class, or
that frosh football star has captured
your fancy, Friday night will be
your big opportunity to get ac
quainted.
Tom Elke, freshman president,
working with Excom on the plans
for the dancc, said that because the
freshmen are spread out all over the
campus and because of the addition
of the Navy unit, ExCom felt that
there was a great need for the
frosh to meet their classmates.
The class of '49 is promised some
thing a little special in entertain
ment, according to Elke. Unusual
stunts will vary the program
throughout the evening. Frosh
couples will sway to the sweet
music of a juke box. and for those
whose interests lie in the refresh
ment table, the food committee will
provide plenty of edibles.
Alice Coutch heads the food com
mittee; George Eckstein has charge
of the music. The decorations are
being handled by Glen Fishback and
Alex Chapel, while Herb Harband,
Bob Beard, and A 1 Green are in
charge of the entertainment. Green
is also doubling as master of cere
monies for the evening.
