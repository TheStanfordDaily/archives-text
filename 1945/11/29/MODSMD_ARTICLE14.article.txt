# A-Bomb Discussion Held at Open Forum; Bailey Speaks on Danger of Armament Race
## 
### 
Dr. Thomas Bailey, at last night's
open forum on the atom bomb, said
that atomic power may either prove
man's greatest blessing or his great
est curse, depending entirely on the
course taken to control it. Unless
something is done immediately, he
said, the world will enter an arma
ment race in atomic weapons, the
beginnings of which are already in
sight. This statement was echoed by
the other speakers, Philip Buck of
the political science department, and
physicists Paul Kirkpatrick and Se
ville Chapman, in the meeting held
at Cubberley Auditorium.
Physics Lesson
Kirkpatrick, the first speaker, de
scribed the atomic principles on
which the bomb is constructed, al
luding to the movement in the solar
system and the similar movement of
electrons around the atomic nucleus.
Dr. Kirkpatrick went on to stress
that the secret of the atom is an open
book. All nations could soon have
the secret.
The atomic bomb may be as big
as a basketball, weighing a few
pounds and easily carried by one or

a few persons. All citizens should
worrk about the use of the atomic
bomb but worrk alone won't rectify
the situation. Action must come
about and come about soon, if we
are to stop civilization from heading
to its downfall.
Dr. Chapman stressed the urgency
of having an international control
of the bomb, saying that a single
bombload of ten bombs could easily
demolish San Francisco.
Seven Suggestions
Seven measures were suggested to
counteract the imminent danger of
the momb: (1) Outlaw the bomb.
This is unreasonable for one cannot
rely on the government officials of
the future to carry on the next war
in a "gentlemanly fashion." (2)
Strengthen the Army and the Navy.
These would be relatively useless
against the bomb and against sabo
teurs.
(3) The United States could set
out to conquer the world. This idea
is discarded at once. (4) Disperse all
cities and move them underground.
The economic corollary of this would
ruin civilization as we know it. (5)

Place military research on an un
limited budget. This is unfavorable.
(6) Promote international goodwill.
This has not proved dependable in
the past.
The seventh and last solution
would be international control of the
bomb. A'n inspection force would be
set up to make sure that no one
manufactured the bombs.
Security Council Control
The international control would
undoubtedly be an outgrowth of the
international security council, he
said. It would have sole charge of
all the atomic bombs, as well as the
right, to use them if necessary.
The record of international organ-
I izations in the past is a discouraging
i one, according to Mr. Duck. At
' present there exists a definite suspi
i cion between national communities.
It is important to note that Russia
I was not represented at the recent
{ meeting of Truman, Attlee, and
King, he said.
Another difficulty is that the
world's "big shots'' fall in groups
of three, five, and eight—groups that
■ would have to get along together.
