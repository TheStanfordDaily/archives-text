## Death in Dead Week 
### 
The question of whether or not professors
are supposed to give exams during dead week
ha"> long been a subject for confusion among
Stanford students. And now that dead week is
fast approaching, we'd like to bring that sub
ject up again to see if it can't be settled once
and for all.
As entering freshmen, we are told (very
serio. ly) by our sponsors that a professor
doe;, net give a test during dead week. It is an
unwritten rule, so they say; and they add par
enthetically that if this rule is ever broken, the
student has a legitimate right to refuse to take
the test.
As to this last statement, we have no proof
that such action has ever been carried out. But
v/e do know that in the past it has been the pol
icy of some departments and some professors
not to spring exams during dead week. This
practice has grown over the years to such an
extent that it is now almost universal.
But because there is no University ruling on
the subject, some professors feel they can, and
do, spring all-important midterms on their
classes in the week preceding finals. Whether
they do this out of forgetfulness, lack of or
ganization of the course, or simply non-famil
iarily with the unwritten pact between teacher
and student, we do not know.
We feel, however, that this practice, no mat
ter how occasional, is an unfair one. Dead
week is supposed to be a week of concen
trated study. All extra-curricular activities
must be dropped the minute dead week starts,
and enforcement of this ruling is carried out
to the letter.
It would seem, therefore, that the same prin
ciple would apply to giving tests in dead week.
For many students, particularly those carrying
heavy courses, the pressure of studying for
an important midterm during dead week can
be demoralizing enough to affect the work they
do on every final.
To a faculty member this reasoning may
seem trivial. To the average student it is of
utmost importance. Besieged on all sides as
he is by a demand for participation in extra
curricular activities during the quarter, it is
difficult for him (especially if he is new and
unacquainted with college life) to organize his
time without relying heavily on dead week
for studying.
Another cause of annoyance is the occasional
professor who forgets to give a midterm until
the v/eek before dead week. Then he appears
in class to announce an exam (counting half
the quarter's grade) for the next day. And when
the class pleads for time he says, "Well, would
you rather take it next week?" "Next week"
being dead week, the class has little alterna
tive it's either the frying pan or the fire. And
with the onslaught of end-quarter activities
(take this coming week-end for example), it's
often a wonder that some of the students come
through alive.
The professor depicted above is not typical;
and the number of students affected by such
actions are very few. But such scenes occur
just often enough to warrant this strong plea
to make the no-tests-in-dead-week practice uni
versal. —M. S. -
