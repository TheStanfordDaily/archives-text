# Bull Session
## 
### STANLEY WILSON 
You know, it kind of makes me sad when I
realise that this will be my last Bull Session of
fall quarter. But you people have been so nice
I have decided to dedicate my last column to
you. I'd like to do more for you, but 3,500
Christmas presents would not quite figure in
my current budget.
I hope the following, written for you, will
express my genuine thankfulness and appre
ciation to you, my readers. It's been a great

quarter, and I'll see you at that January 3rd
orgy in the Ad Building.
My little effort below is entitled, "My Christ
mas Story," or "How Santa Developed That
Big Red Nose."
Santa Claus means lots to me,
But still I think of this:
With every ornamented tree,
A fifth of Scotch is bliss.
The first time that I saw St. Nick,
His nose was big and red.
He said right then (and very quick),
"Without this fifth I would be dead."
You see, our friend of joy and fun,
Of whom we think a lot,
Could never ever get 'hings done.
Without his double shot.
It keeps him warm and makes him merry,
And though he does abide;
He does his job and doesn't tarry,
And never once gets fried.
Now you might think there's never time,
When St. Nick does his tricks,
To stop at that chalet of mine
And drink up five or six.
But every year since I was four
He's come to visit me,
And we have toasted by the score;
How happy then are we!!
This rendezvous is fun for all,
And Mamma doesn't mind,
He brings free booze on every call;
Don't you think that's kind?
This sort of Christmas, some may cry,
For kids it's not to do.
But Christmas Eve without a fry,
And old St. Nick is through.
He likes his kids, he likes his wife.
He likes to up and cheer it.
But Christmas Eve just has no life,
Without his fifth of spirit.
You know, it kind of makes me sad when I
