### ELLIOT EPSTEEN HURLEY RESIGNATION 
Ambassador Hurley resigned from his China
post. He found the State Department rather un
disciplined, and was mad about it. He had
good reason to be.
He was a major general, and major generals
are used to thinking in terms of taking orders
from lieutenant generals and giving them to
brigadiers. He expected the state department
to work that way, and it didn't. He had good
reason to be disgusted.
STATE DEPT.
Quite often, somebody in Washington issues
a statement about reforming the State Depart
ment. They're a dime a dozen, but nothing is
ever done about them.
People will enter a foreign service career for
money or for honor. All over the world the pay
is low, and in America, the highest posts go to
people who have swung the proper number
of votes at the last election. Thus a talented
young man with an ability for languages and
learning customs of foreign lands is tempted
to go into international business circles or jour
nalism rather than the foreign service. The
unfortunate results of our spoils system has
put a premium on good talent in professional
government service, because it has forced so
much of it into private enterprise.
By infecting the higher ranks of the State
Department with patrons of the party in power,
or their proteges, we have given our presidents
diplomats with levers of control over their
theoretical chiefs, Thus, is it any wonder that
the good talent we have would not be dis
couraged, and a lot of the bad talent given a
free hand?
FUNCTION
The function of a state department is to
carry out a nation's foreign policy, not to
work it out. The function of the foreign serv
ice officer should be similar to that of the army
officer; he should follow orders of his supe
riors and of his commander-in-chief.
Yet, in China, a high ranking diplomat with
an excellent army record for maintaining dis
cipline and leading men, found himself in
capable of controlling squabbling cliques of
subordinates who were theoretically under him.
MANIFESTATIONS
This has been just the most publicized out
cropping of a phenomenon quite discernable
to anybody who reads the newspapers; namely,
our State Department is so thoroughly split that
it is almost ineffectual. This was evident at
London, Iran, in Turkey, in our policies towards
Russia and Franco Spain.
Certainly everybody realizes that we need a
state department that is more than a political
football; and this unfortunately means an en
tire new structure of foreign service. One of
the necessities of it is discipline, and it seems
doubtful that it can be instilled under the pres
ent system.

capable of controlling squabbling cliques of
subordinates who were theoretically under him.
MANIFESTATIONS
This has been just the most publicized out
cropping of a phenomenon quite discernable
to anybody who reads the newspapers; namely,
our State Department is so thoroughly split that
it is almost ineffectual. This was evident at
London, Iran, in Turkey, in our policies towards
Russia and Franco Spain.
Certainly everybody realizes that we need a
state department that is more than a political
football; and this unfortunately means an en
tire new structure of foreign service. One of
the necessities of it is discipline, and it seems
doubtful that it can be instilled under the pres
ent system.
Ambassador Hurley resigned from his China
post. He found the State Department rather un
disciplined, and was mad about it. He had
good reason to be.
He was a major general, and major generals
are used to thinking in terms of taking orders
from lieutenant generals and giving them to
brigadiers. He expected the state department
to work that way, and it didn't. He had good
reason to be disgusted.
STATE DEPT.
Quite often, somebody in Washington issues
a statement about reforming the State Depart
ment. They're a dime a dozen, but nothing is
ever done about them.
People will enter a foreign service career for
money or for honor. All over the world the pay
is low, and in America, the highest posts go to
people who have swung the proper number
of votes at the last election. Thus a talented
young man with an ability for languages and
learning customs of foreign lands is tempted
to go into international business circles or jour
nalism rather than the foreign service. The
unfortunate results of our spoils system has
put a premium on good talent in professional
government service, because it has forced so
much of it into private enterprise.
By infecting the higher ranks of the State
Department with patrons of the party in power,
or their proteges, we have given our presidents
diplomats with levers of control over their
theoretical chiefs, Thus, is it any wonder that
the good talent we have would not be dis
couraged, and a lot of the bad talent given a
free hand?
FUNCTION
The function of a state department is to
carry out a nation's foreign policy, not to
work it out. The function of the foreign serv
ice officer should be similar to that of the army
officer; he should follow orders of his supe
riors and of his commander-in-chief.
Yet, in China, a high ranking diplomat with
an excellent army record for maintaining dis
cipline and leading men, found himself in
capable of controlling squabbling cliques of
subordinates who were theoretically under him.
