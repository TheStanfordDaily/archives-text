# Stanford Gridders Prepare For Merchant Marine Tilt
## 
### 
! Stanford's varsity football squad
! "puddled" their way through a foot
j ball session yesterday afternoon,
j Despite the constant down-pour,
| Coach Marchie Schwartz put his
| grid proteges through their paces.
Practice, however, was limited
to punting and signal practice.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford grid great
! of another era, turned out for the
football festivities, and helped
Curt Burks, Kit - Supple, and Bill
Larson with their punting.
One of the unfortunate things
about football practice this fall has
been tlie lack of individual atten
j tion given to players. This, how
ever, has been unavoidable. Coach
Schwartz's return to Stanford was
j strictly of a short-run variety. His
assistants are in the armed serv
ices, and one, Vic Lindskog, has
been playing professional football
this fall. Fred Scribner, who
played for Stanford a dozen years
ago, and Fritz Wilcox. Creighton
scatbaek of a few years back, did
i step in and have helped out won
derfully.
Curt Burks will .start at the quar
terback post, and Fred Willey will
j do the plunging from fullback. On
Willey's right side will be Gene
j Martin, an all-state prep player from
| lowa, and to Willey's left will be
i stationed Don Lipelt.
Stanford's gridiron opposition, the
! San Mateo Merchant Marine Acad
j emy, is an unknown quantity, ex
; cept that their team is good. In less
than a half-dozen games, they have
run up over 100 points, and have
j lost only one game and that to San
Jose State.
Offensively, the Merchant Ma
riners use the T formation and the
! single wing. According to Dick
Wortman, sports editor of "The
Bearings," school publication, a
band and a rooting section will he
brought along for the Saturday af
-1 ternoon game.â€”Levinson
