### BILL ADAMS, S 2/c 
It's still the same old Farm—who'd have thought it? After
an absence of nearly six months, the latter part of which was
spent being pushed around by every barnacled boatswain's
mate in Uncle Sam's Navy, yours sincerely returns to his favor
ite haunts to find that it still rains at Stanford, that the old gang
have not all flunked out after all, and even that the Daily is as
much of a mess as ever.
We do, however, observe one great change, and it's one we
prayed for and even tried to work tor, though not very success
lully, in all the time we were here. Stanford is again represented
on the athletic fields ot the Pacilic Coast.
Our university has a heritage in football history surpassed
by very few colleges in the United States. For of the four great
coaches who have had more influence on the game perhaps
than all others put together, three coached Cardinal teams.
Walter Camp, credited with the invention of modern football,
was coaching Stanford teams at the turn of the century. The
great Cardinal teams coached by Pop Warner, developer of
the wingback formations, will never be forgotten. And Clark
Shaughnessy, with his undefeated model T in 1940, has made
for himself and for Stanford a permanent place in football an
nals. The immortal Rockne, greatest of them all, of course never
coached a Farm team; but many would have done credit to him.
These men represent the finest element in football. They
never gave up when the going got tough. And yet when the
war came on we betrayed the heritage which they left us by
abandoning athletics. That is over now. We are attempting
to redeem ourselves now by returning to participation. It may
take a while, £>ut we can do it. Remember that that heritage is
maintained, not by always producing a championship team, but
by fielding a team that has the guts to stay with it, win, lose,
or draw. You and I would be in a hell of a spot if the United
States had given up in 1942 because were were losing the war.
The team which will represent us Saturday may not be com
parable to the aggregations of Camp, Warner, and Shaughnessy,
but it is redeeming our honor and paving the way for greater
things to come. It should rank as one of the historic Stanford
teams of all time.

than all others put together, three coached Cardinal teams.
Walter Camp, credited with the invention of modern football,
was coaching Stanford teams at the turn of the century. The
great Cardinal teams coached by Pop Warner, developer of
the wingback formations, will never be forgotten. And Clark
Shaughnessy, with his undefeated model T in 1940, has made
for himself and for Stanford a permanent place in football an
nals. The immortal Rockne, greatest of them all, of course never
coached a Farm team; but many would have done credit to him.
These men represent the finest element in football. They
never gave up when the going got tough. And yet when the
war came on we betrayed the heritage which they left us by
abandoning athletics. That is over now. We are attempting
to redeem ourselves now by returning to participation. It may
take a while, £>ut we can do it. Remember that that heritage is
maintained, not by always producing a championship team, but
by fielding a team that has the guts to stay with it, win, lose,
or draw. You and I would be in a hell of a spot if the United
States had given up in 1942 because were were losing the war.
The team which will represent us Saturday may not be com
parable to the aggregations of Camp, Warner, and Shaughnessy,
but it is redeeming our honor and paving the way for greater
things to come. It should rank as one of the historic Stanford
teams of all time.
