# Bunn Reports Army Sports

### 
An unstable staff and the lack of
facilities are two acute problems
facing the United States in launch
ing a winter sports program in Eu
rope. According to a letter received
by Dr. O. N. Andersen from John
Bunn, Dean of Men, a consultant
in this sports program, a great num
ber of qualified men in physical ed
ucation are needed to stabilize the
staff, which is now under the direc
tion of Col. Kenneth Fields. These
men should have a civilian status
and should be free to work in Eu
rope for an indefinite time.
The huge recreational program
will serve 400,0(10 men who will
make up the permanent Army of
Occupation. This mass program
lias made a good start with bas
ketball and similar plans are be
ing made to include other athlet
ics. Each company will have one
team.
At the present time, the companies
have as few as 40 or 50 men, which
means that about 25 per cent will
engage in basketball alone. A com
pany also may have more than one
team and ii courts are lound adja
cent to company quarters, any num
ber may participate in informal play.
Competition will be encouraged.
Teams will be organized within
leagues, within regiments, and with
in divisions, Mr. Bunn said. Play
offs will progress until the final the
ater tournament for the champion
ship. In addition, division teams will
have their own league.
The lack of sufficient facilities
is a tremendous problem, he said.
The Germans have not partici
pated in the same winter sports as
<he United States; consequently
gymnasia are not the proper size,
particularly for basketball. A suit
able building must, therefore, be
found, and then converted into a
gymnasium with all the required
equipment. As a result of the ex
tensive bombing and shelling in
large centers, there are very few
buildings that are not destroyed.
Many other departments besides
file* sports office require quarters
too, Mr. Bunn continued. Thus
tlie problem is made more acute.
The practice of good principles
along the line of public health in
Germany is practically absent. Peo
ple live with the pigs, cesspool,
manure pile, and the kitchen all
opening into the same small court.
Mr. Bunn said that there was not
much evidence of the practice of
good personal hygiene, and moral
standards are non-existent.
