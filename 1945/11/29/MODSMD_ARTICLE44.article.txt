# Saito Questions Freedom of Konoye

### 
TOKYO. Nov. 28 (UP).â€”A veteran Progressive party member touched
off a tumultuous demonstration on the floor of the Japanese House of Rep
resentatives today when he demanded to know why Prince Fumimariro
Konoye, former Premier, had not been arrested as a war criminal.
Takao Saito, 75, Yale graduate, told the House that "The Japanese people
have the greatest grudge against General (Hideki) Tojo and Prince Ko
noye. To jo has been arrested as a war criminal but not Konoye. How s
that?"
Saito's remarks were made as an interpolation after Premier Baron
Kijuro Shidchara repeated to the House of Representatives a speech he
had made earlier to the House of Peers outlining the government's aims and
policies. Shidehara spoke on the second day of the extraordinary session of
the Diet which was opened yesterday by Emperor Hirohito.
