### 
WASHINGTON, Nbv. 28 (UP).â€”Rep. Frank B. Kcefe, Wis., a Republi
can member of the Pearl Harbor investigating committee, made formal
demand today for all communications between the late President Roosevelt
and former Prime Minister Winston Churchill which might throw light on
the Dec. 7, 1941, disaster.
Without revealing specifically what he hoped to learn, he asked com
mittee counsel William D. Mitchell to obtain all such correspondence ex
changed in the period from Nov. 24 to Dec. 7.
He wants to know, He said, what Churchill and Roosevelt had to say
about the United States' final peace offer to Japan, made on Nov. 26. 1941,
and what reply, if any, the war President made to Churchill's suggestion
Nov. 30 that a warning be sent to Japan.
