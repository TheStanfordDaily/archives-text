Beginning classes at Stanford win
ter quarter for men without pre
vious military training will be a
streamlined part of the recently an
nounced new interim R.O.T.C. pro
gram, Col. John R. Eden, professor
of military science and tactics, stated
today.
Colonel Eden explained that in
struction in the basic course, open
to beginners, has been reduced
from a former five-hour weekly
requirement to three hours. These
three hours, he explained, may be
taken successively any afternoon
or staggered in one-hour periods
over several afternoons.
One of the three hours may be
used as part of the three-hour phys
ical education requirement of lower
division students, since the Physical
Education Department is offering a
special two-hour course (PE-5) for
military students that makes this
feature possible.
Colonel Eden suggested that those
lower division students who arc
physically fit for induction under
Selective Service give serious con
sideration to the possible values reg
istration in this course will have for
them. Many inducted after taking
R.O.T.C. have found the training has
helped them in the Army's basic
training centers, he commented.
"For those takiijg it who arc
not inducted it may serve as a
preparation for the officer can
didate training of the advanced
R.O.T.C. course," Col. Eden said.
At Stanford those students who
have had two years in a high school
R.O.T.C. program are exempted
from the beginning basic course.
They may register winter quarter in
a second-year course, he explained.
Men will be chosen for the ad
vanced R.O.T.C. program, suspended
