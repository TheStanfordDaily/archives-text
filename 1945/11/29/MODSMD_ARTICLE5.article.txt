# 'Magic Flute' Tryouts End
## 
### 
J
Last chance for tryouts for the
winter quarter opera, "The Magic
Flute, will be tomorrow afternoon
at 5 in the music room of the Art
Gallery, according to Jan Popper,
director of the Opera Workshop.
Tryoutees do not necessarily have
to know the music of the opera, but
are requested to bring their own
music for the tryouts. There are 16
solo parts available, and 45 chorus
parts. Since most of the chorus parts
are for male voices, says Dr. Popper,
it is hoped that a number of the
veterans at Stanford will turn out
for the production.
"The Magic Flute," one of Mo
zart's best-known operas, has not
been presented on the coast for quite
some time. It was originally written
in German, but Stanford has an ex
cellent English translation, the same
one used by the Metropolitan Opera
Company, according to Dr. Popper.
