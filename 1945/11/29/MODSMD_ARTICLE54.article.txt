# Speech on Genes Heard by Seminar
## 
### 
George Wells Beadle, professor of |
biology, addressed the Chemistry |
I Seminar last week on the subject of
I "Chemical Genetics." Prof. Beadle,
J who has made many advancements
in uncovering some of the proper-
I ties of genes through experimenta
j tion with mold, revealed some of his
findings to his audience.
In his last address before leaving
Stanford for th" California Institute
of Technology, Dr. Beadle discussed
how defective genes operate to block
the synthesis of various chemical
substances. Relatively, a great deal
is still unknown about the factor of j
genes. What is a gene? The best !
definition might be that it is a unit
of inheritance and that it is prob
ably a nucleo-protein complex, said
Prof. Beadle.
