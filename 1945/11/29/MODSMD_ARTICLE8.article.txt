### 
'"Nix with '46, but to heaven with
'47" is the cry of the junior class
as they prepare to meet the senior
class tomorrow night from 8 to 11
in the May field Theater for the no
date Junior-Senior Party.
For the first time since the war,
upper-classmen will meet to com
pete for top honors in impromptu
skits, games, gags, and various kinds
of stunts. Cokes, popcorn, and suck
ers will be sold up and down the
aisles during the evening.
Dick Tracy? Tommy?
The highlight of the program will
be a "surprise" movie serial, which
will be presented in all four install
ments in one evening especially for
the two classes. Between install
ments the seniors and juniors will
put on their skits. Don Bechter will
be master of ceremonies for the
evening.
Tickets for the affair may still be
bought for GO cents at the Cellar,
the Post OfTice, and on Quad. Sales
will be open today and tomorrow to
soohomores and freshmen.
