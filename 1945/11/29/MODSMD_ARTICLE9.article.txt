# Vets Request Harmonicas
## 
### 
Harmonicas arc urgently needed
i by the veterans at the Veterans'
Hospital to promote a cheerful spirit
I as the holiday season rolls around,
according to the Palo Alto Red Cross
Public Relations Committee.
When the war came, harmonicas
! went, and their production has since
not been resumed. The Red Cross
i Camp and Hospital unit, whose job
i it is to get soldiers in hospitals what
they want and need, have been un
able to find any, and hope that any
one not using theirs will turn it in
l for this purpose.
i Anyone willing and able to pro

vide these instruments for the vet
erans is asked to call Mrs. Betty
Cook. Jones of the Red Cross at
2-3459, who will call to pick it up,
or notify the Red Cross headquar
ters at 2-2144.
