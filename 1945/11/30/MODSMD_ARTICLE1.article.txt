# RED-WHITE BALL. GRID TILT TOMORROW
## First Post-War Christmas Recalls Former Holidays 
### 
For many Farm students this first
peacetime Christmas in four years
also marks several other firsts,
among them Stanford's return to its
usual Christmas vacation length.
The short vacation was a war in
novation, instituted in 1943 to co
ordinate Stanford's civilian academic
program with that of the ASTP,
which at that time outnumbered
non-military students on campus.
Ileal Christmas
The year 1943 saw what was prob

ably the first real Christmas the
Farm ever had. The three-day va
cation extended from Dec. 24 to 26
with finals starting immediately
afterward; and kept the majority of
students on the campus celebrating
j the brief holiday in their own living
groups.
A gala round of open houses,
caroling by various groups, and a
midnight Christmas service in the
Chapel were among the many ac
tivities that made Christmas on the
Farm that year almost good enough
I to keep localites away from home.
Perhaps Stanford's last really nor
j mal Christmas season was in 1940,
! a year of overwhelming success for
j the Farm's football squad. Charged
with such football greats as Frankie
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, and Norm
Standlec, the Vow Boys of 1940
swept over all opponents to chalk
up an unbeaten-untied record. This
record was kept in the Rose Bowl
I when Clark Shaughnessy's men went
| out to defeat Nebraska to the tune
j of 21-13.
1 Spirits High
Farm students weren't exactly
! unhappy in 1941 when around the
beginning of December they retired
to their books to bone for coming
finals. Even though the team had
taken a beating from Cal in the Big
Game, and the Axe was gone for a
year, there was the usual round of
end-quarter activities to keep spir
its high through dead week.
Events of a week changed all this.
Like no San Francisco earthquake
could ever do, the Jap attack on
Pearl Harbor shook a carefree Stan
ford out of its peacetime lethargy
and left it stunned by the event of
a second World War.
A Daily extra, published in the
midst of finals week that year, re
flected Farm reaction to the news.
At a student assembly President
Ray Lyman Wilbur yvarned the
school that "we're right up against
the guns."
Blackout Instructions
The extra gave detailed blackout
instructions published messages
from Dr. Wilbur and Dean Mary
Yost, offered suggestions for stu
dent contributions to the war ef-
I fort, and printed a list of campus
men who had been called up or
were enlisting immediately in the
armed services.
Christmas will be gayer this year.
There will be more food, more ski
ing (and more reservations), and no
world war. But as Stanford students
trek homeward to celebrate the holi
days, they will realize that not all
national and international problems
are gone. The atom bomb, labor
troubles, famine, and civil wars arc
ill important problems, the out
come of which may well determine
the kind of Christmas seasons fu
ture Stanford students will have.

with finals starting immediately
afterward; and kept the majority of
students on the campus celebrating
j the brief holiday in their own living
groups.
A gala round of open houses,
caroling by various groups, and a
midnight Christmas service in the
Chapel were among the many ac
tivities that made Christmas on the
Farm that year almost good enough
I to keep localites away from home.
Perhaps Stanford's last really nor
j mal Christmas season was in 1940,
! a year of overwhelming success for
j the Farm's football squad. Charged
with such football greats as Frankie
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, and Norm
Standlec, the Vow Boys of 1940
swept over all opponents to chalk
up an unbeaten-untied record. This
record was kept in the Rose Bowl
I when Clark Shaughnessy's men went
| out to defeat Nebraska to the tune
j of 21-13.
1 Spirits High
Farm students weren't exactly
! unhappy in 1941 when around the
beginning of December they retired
to their books to bone for coming
finals. Even though the team had
taken a beating from Cal in the Big
Game, and the Axe was gone for a
year, there was the usual round of
end-quarter activities to keep spir
its high through dead week.
Events of a week changed all this.
Like no San Francisco earthquake
could ever do, the Jap attack on
Pearl Harbor shook a carefree Stan
ford out of its peacetime lethargy
and left it stunned by the event of
a second World War.
A Daily extra, published in the
midst of finals week that year, re
flected Farm reaction to the news.
At a student assembly President
Ray Lyman Wilbur yvarned the
school that "we're right up against
the guns."
Blackout Instructions
The extra gave detailed blackout
instructions published messages
from Dr. Wilbur and Dean Mary
Yost, offered suggestions for stu
dent contributions to the war ef-
I fort, and printed a list of campus
men who had been called up or
were enlisting immediately in the
armed services.
Christmas will be gayer this year.
There will be more food, more ski
ing (and more reservations), and no
world war. But as Stanford students
trek homeward to celebrate the holi
days, they will realize that not all
national and international problems
are gone. The atom bomb, labor
troubles, famine, and civil wars arc
ill important problems, the out
come of which may well determine
the kind of Christmas seasons fu
ture Stanford students will have.

For many Farm students this first
peacetime Christmas in four years
also marks several other firsts,
among them Stanford's return to its
usual Christmas vacation length.
The short vacation was a war in
novation, instituted in 1943 to co
ordinate Stanford's civilian academic
program with that of the ASTP,
which at that time outnumbered
non-military students on campus.
Ileal Christmas
The year 1943 saw what was prob

ably the first real Christmas the
Farm ever had. The three-day va
cation extended from Dec. 24 to 26
with finals starting immediately
afterward; and kept the majority of
students on the campus celebrating
