♦ Marehie Schwartz has been put
ting his uricl charges through a
heavy schedule this week, empha
sizing pass defense, and passing of
fensively. These two gridiron de
fects probably caused Stanford's
defeat against the Stockton Com
mandos.
The playcr-in-charge of pass
in;; is Curt Burks, a fast little
quarterback, lie has always been
talented with pigskin heaving, but
in his first game two weeks ago, ho
lacked the confidence to call more
pjiss plays, bill that ill has been
i solved, and fans can expect to irco
a wide-open football panie.
Starting at the right half spot is
Gene Martin, who has received
unanimous acclaim as being one of
the best men on the squad. A hefty
player—he tips the scales at close
to 200 pounds—he, nevertheless, is
very fast, and plunges through the
opposition with a terrifis force.
Over at the left halfback position
is Don Lipelt, a speedy freshman
from Lodi. He is a shifty little run
ner, and any time he totes the pig
skin, look for distance gained. Li
pelt wasn't familiar with Stockton's
passing attack in the last game, but
good drill on pass defense has put
him in top shape for this content,
against the merchant mariners of
San Mateo.
The middleman of the T forma
tion is Fred Willey, who per
formed during his prep days for
the classy Piedmont squad. Smce
then be has served in the Air
Corps, and is fast returning to top
football shape. His plunging from
the fullback position is reminis
cent of the way Norm Standlee
used to reel oIT gains for the im
mortal Model T of '40.
The same line that started in the
j first game will hear the opening
whistle from the playing field this
Saturday. Ric Supple will handle
one of the end posts and at the other
flanker spot will be stationed Dave
DeSwarte, who caught a touchdown
j pass in the first game.
Harry Davison, big 200-poundor,
and Bill Lundquist will take care of
the tackle positions. Both men are
big and powerful, and any running
attempts by the merchant marine
school should be stopped co4d by
these two men.
At the guard posts are Harvey
Dyer and Jim Fryc. Both men
showed well in their last game,
and Coach Schwartz expects them
to play stellar roles in the Satur
day fray. Centering the football
j will be Bob Ahrams, who is im
proving everyday.
There will be no admission ehargc
| for the game.
