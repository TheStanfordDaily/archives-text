# Accident Rate Rises Alarmingly; Take Care
## 
### 
(Editorial Note)
Time out from plans for one of
the biggest "pie-dead-week" week
ends since 1941 for a word to all
automobile drivers. With the end
of gas rationing and the poor
condition of many cars and itres,
the accident rate has risen ap
pallingly, and has not excepted
Stanford students. Perhaps it IS
always "the other fellow"; that's
further reason to drive sanely,
drive carefully.
