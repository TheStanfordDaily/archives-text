Though the Daily stops publishing today for
the remainder of the quarter, news and public
affairs go on. We stop publishing at a difficult
time because we want to say more about one
item in particular—that is this Atomic Bomb
Control business, which was brilliantly brought
to our attention again Wednesday night by a
forum of Stanford professors.
Though poorly attended, this meeting re
ceived more response than the usual student
attended lectures by those students who did
brave the rain to go.
Several students have come to the Daily with
comments about this urgent problem. Most re
gretably, we simply do not have the room in
this ad-filled final paper, to give this question all
the space we know it deserves.
It should be noticed however that they em
phasized their belief in the necessity for an
international organization as the only means to
control the use of this bomb—one that would
seek to get at the root of the trouble—war.
Have we realized for instance, that while the
other most powerful country in the world, Rus
sia, grows more distrustful of our intentions day
by day, and other nations come closer to arriv
ing at a production process of their own—all
scientists say this is inevitable. The only exist
ing apparatus for action, the United Nations
Organization, is without its temporary members
of the security council, and it will not get to
gether to discuss the atom bomb question until
January.
Students, rising to their feet, to ask what could
be done, were told that the only responsibility
we have is what we choose to assume, it might
be to make these facts known among our fellow
students, to try to secure Stanford support for
the course we think is the one step left. In its
present state, it is not a consideration for op
timism..
These things seem to go without saying—and
yet can we even satisfy our own conscience
about playing well the small part asked of us?
