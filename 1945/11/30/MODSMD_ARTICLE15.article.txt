# “30” For a Quarter
## 
### 
Holidays and final schedules being what they
are this quarter, we find ourselves about to wish
you a merry Christmas before thoughts of our
Thanksgiving dinner have left us; but dead week
approaches and this is the last edition of the
Daily for autumn quarter, 1945, which is always
an occasion to look back over the events of the
last three months, and to look ahead to what is
to come.
This quarter saw Stanford in a war-to-peace
transition stage; and, as with many individuals
and institutions, unexpected peace made solu
tion of problems that had seemed far-distant an
Immediate necessity. Throughout the quarter
the question of how to cope with an increasing
enrollment, particularly of men now returning
to college, has been the subject of University
thought, planning, and action. Further plans
and policies will undoubtedly be forthcoming
in succeeding quarters, but some things are
certain by now: the greater demand and the
need for a university education in today's so
ciety; the fact that a larger number of students
are enrolling in universities today because of
that need and because they are better equipped
financially to do so; and the fact that a great
many students who are enrolled in Stanford to
day and who will enroll in future quarters do
so because they know by personal experience,
or they have "heard," that Stanford in the past
has tried to maintain a high scholastic stand
ard, a renowned faculty, and a tradition of
pleasant living and free thinking and study.
Expansion of a university to meet new situa
tions, retaining, where possible, those attitudes
and traditions that are of worth is a basis of fu
ture activity.
With the "war to peace" reconversion has
come a reorganization of activities on a peace
time basis. White-sweatered Rally Com mem
bers have again made an appearance at rallies
and football games, "big name bands" are back,
the Daily, through the work of staff members
new and old, has appeared with large format
each morning at living unit breakfast tables;
and a university is again back at its rightful job
of training students for peace instead of war.
At the beginning of the quarter, however, we
said that we hoped Stanford students would
remember some of their experiences during
years '41 to '45, and that the v/artime influence
which led to more serious thought on national
and international issues, or to the ability of the
individual or the group to face immediate prob

lems and solve them, v/ould not be lost now.
Stanford, we pointed out, could never go
"back to normal," but would have to move for
ward in a world where a revolution in Indonesia,
labor-management trouble at home, above all,
the solution of the atomic bomb problem through
the establishment of a world organization, will
have a vital effect on whether or not college life
as we know it will continue at all.
Believing that only by working toward the
perfection of relationships between individuals
and small groups can national and international
harmony be approached, the Daily also con
cerned itself with problems purely local in
character. Among these were the new A.S.S.U.
Constitution, with its area representation plan,
which is on trial basis before the final election
next spring. Another is the women's housing
plan, currently having "growing pains" as steps
taken in wartime come up for reckoning in
peace. The plan, based on the contention that
the sole criteria for the selection of one's house
mates is their willingness to accept the respon
sibilities concurrent with that living unit, is a
new experiment for many. The attempt, how
ever, to develop the concept of "group con
geniality" through a program imposed from
ine outside to "unify all Stanford womanhood"
is, to our minds, distasteful, and actually dan
gerous to the rights of minorities.
Men's housing, too, has come up during the
quarter, particularly in regard to potential re
turn and reopening of the fraternities. Rushing
is now-being conducted among various frater
nity groups, though, it appears, with little or
ganization. Inter-Fraternity Board will have
much to consider in future quarters.
. . . .Autumn quarter, meanwhile, is com
ing to an end; and, this year as Stanford stu
dents decorate Christmas trees or sing carols,
"Peace on earth; good will toward men" has
a little more meaning.

have a vital effect on whether or not college life
as we know it will continue at all.
Believing that only by working toward the
perfection of relationships between individuals
and small groups can national and international
harmony be approached, the Daily also con
cerned itself with problems purely local in
character. Among these were the new A.S.S.U.
Constitution, with its area representation plan,
which is on trial basis before the final election
next spring. Another is the women's housing
plan, currently having "growing pains" as steps
taken in wartime come up for reckoning in
peace. The plan, based on the contention that
the sole criteria for the selection of one's house
mates is their willingness to accept the respon
sibilities concurrent with that living unit, is a
new experiment for many. The attempt, how
ever, to develop the concept of "group con
geniality" through a program imposed from
ine outside to "unify all Stanford womanhood"
is, to our minds, distasteful, and actually dan
gerous to the rights of minorities.
Men's housing, too, has come up during the
quarter, particularly in regard to potential re
turn and reopening of the fraternities. Rushing
is now-being conducted among various frater
nity groups, though, it appears, with little or
ganization. Inter-Fraternity Board will have
much to consider in future quarters.
. . . .Autumn quarter, meanwhile, is com
ing to an end; and, this year as Stanford stu

"Peace on earth; good will toward men" has
a little more meaning.
Holidays and final schedules being what they
are this quarter, we find ourselves about to wish
you a merry Christmas before thoughts of our
Thanksgiving dinner have left us; but dead week
approaches and this is the last edition of the
Daily for autumn quarter, 1945, which is always
an occasion to look back over the events of the
last three months, and to look ahead to what is
to come.
This quarter saw Stanford in a war-to-peace
transition stage; and, as with many individuals
and institutions, unexpected peace made solu
tion of problems that had seemed far-distant an
Immediate necessity. Throughout the quarter
the question of how to cope with an increasing
enrollment, particularly of men now returning
to college, has been the subject of University
thought, planning, and action. Further plans
and policies will undoubtedly be forthcoming
in succeeding quarters, but some things are
certain by now: the greater demand and the
need for a university education in today's so
ciety; the fact that a larger number of students
are enrolling in universities today because of
that need and because they are better equipped
financially to do so; and the fact that a great
many students who are enrolled in Stanford to
day and who will enroll in future quarters do
so because they know by personal experience,
or they have "heard," that Stanford in the past
has tried to maintain a high scholastic stand
ard, a renowned faculty, and a tradition of
pleasant living and free thinking and study.
Expansion of a university to meet new situa
tions, retaining, where possible, those attitudes
and traditions that are of worth is a basis of fu
ture activity.
With the "war to peace" reconversion has
come a reorganization of activities on a peace
time basis. White-sweatered Rally Com mem
bers have again made an appearance at rallies
and football games, "big name bands" are back,
the Daily, through the work of staff members
new and old, has appeared with large format
each morning at living unit breakfast tables;
and a university is again back at its rightful job
of training students for peace instead of war.
At the beginning of the quarter, however, we
said that we hoped Stanford students would
remember some of their experiences during
years '41 to '45, and that the v/artime influence
which led to more serious thought on national
and international issues, or to the ability of the
individual or the group to face immediate prob

lems and solve them, v/ould not be lost now.
Stanford, we pointed out, could never go
"back to normal," but would have to move for
ward in a world where a revolution in Indonesia,
labor-management trouble at home, above all,
the solution of the atomic bomb problem through
the establishment of a world organization, will
have a vital effect on whether or not college life
as we know it will continue at all.

perfection of relationships between individuals
and small groups can national and international
