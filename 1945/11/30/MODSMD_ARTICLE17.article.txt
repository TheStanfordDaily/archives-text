IS STANFORD OUR MISTAKE?
To the Editor:
According to the interpretation of Stanford's Social
philosophy by student leaders"and others, we can only
assume that we have made a mistake in coming to
Stanford. They have shown us that Social education at
Stanford is destined to play a larger part in our lives
than we care to have it play.
For example, all girls living in Lagunita were re
quired to be members of Social committees for the
formal Lagunita tea, whether or not they chose to
participate in that kind of activity.
Since this requirement did not allow individuals
to act according to their own convictions about such
matters, we have wondered what rights are left to
the minority whose convictions seem to differ with
the majority opinion in such a case.
This measure seems to violate the rights of the mi
nority, in an intelligent community, who have no wish
to obstruct, But merely do not wish to participate in
activities which they do not approve for themselves.
Group activities in a dormitory cannot be planned
on a scale larger than can be supported by the ma
jority which approves. Activities requiring unani
mous participation, where there is not unanimous
support, can only be carried out by compulsory meas
ures, compulsory measures, we feel, do not take into
consideration the fact that many students prefer non
social student activities which command their loyal
ties and time even to the point of infringing upon
their studies.
There is evidence of a tendency toward coercion in
the proposal to have compulsory attendance at Lagu
nita house meetings which appear to be essentially
instruments of social programs. Thus we are told
that in coming to Stanford we have agreed to partici
pate in and support Stanford's social activities to an
extent that, we feel, encroaches upon our right to
choose our own activities.
Such coercion seems to us to entail a lack of respect
for individual responsibility.
The only reason we speak at all in admitting our
error in coming here is that at times we have thought
that Stanford, with its unusually friendly and social
atmosphere, with its many unusual opportunities for
training of a worthwhile nature in student organiza
tions and government, and with its fair share of in
spiring teachers and individuals, could have a place
for many kinds of people to exchange ideas and bene
fit from differences of opinion. VVe have been taught
that we might make a greater contribution to our
education and to others if we concentrated upon out
individual roles in society and gained at Stanford
the means to play thein well.
Instead, it appears that we are aiming for a "type"
of Social animal by the increasing efforts to decide
what the activities of an individual "should" be, rather
than allowing her to choose for herself. This Iype is
to be The Stanford Woman.
We hardly think that this letter will change any
thing. After several years here we realize that So
cial pressure is a deepseated and growing thing, and
that only radical changes through the efforts of many
individuals can change it.
