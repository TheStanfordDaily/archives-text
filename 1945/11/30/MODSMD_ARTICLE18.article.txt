CONGRESS
Congress is very alarmed over the mounting troubles
on the labor scene. It seems to be blaming it on labor,
and is passing a lot of strong legislation. One good
thing coming up is a measure to make labor unions
responsible for their contracts. Under the old system,
a labor union was not a definite legal entity, and
couldn't be pinned down if it threw out the whole
contract agreement.
The gist of the legislation is that a union violat
ing a "no-strike" clause will run into trouble. Labor
rlailns it is a union-busting bit of legislation de
signed to ruin collective bargaining by saddling
labor leaders with law suit after law suit.
Actually the legislation will be very ineffective.
