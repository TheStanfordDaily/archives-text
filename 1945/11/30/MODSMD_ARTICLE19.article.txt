# CAMPUS OPINION

(The following lyrics wyre prompted l>y the decision of Housing Com
mittee and University officials, announced Tuesday, to "shrink" Juniper
Lodge, in preparation for its return to Delta Upsilon fraternity. Accord
ing to its author, the words were designed to fit "My Name Is Yankee
Doodle.)
THE FALL OF JUNIPER
We could move to Atignugal where the food they say is swell,
But what Juniper Maid in her right mind would move to that
hotel?
They tell us it's the "smartest" dorm in all of California,
But it's just a big impersonal barn, of that fact we will warn ya!
Who are we sir? We're Juniper girls true blue.
You can shrink us down and split us up,
But we will all pull through.
We could even move to Dogwood Dorm, but we'd take our spirit
with us
And when their average started down, they'd raise one helluva
fuss!
You could put us in Horse-Chestnut Hut, their reps are the worst
on the Farm,
We'd either build their morals up, or do 'em a lot of harm!
Who are we sir? We're personification of spirit.
And no matter where you bury us,
From us you'll always hear it.
We could move to charming Pinkham Place, where the social
debs all dwell,
But I'd sooner hang my shingle out in that friendly place called
Hell!
We've been offered Jefferson's basement, but there's only room
for a few,
So the question still confronts us, JUST WHAT ARE WE TO
DO???

Any resemblance to any houses on campus is purely! In a
moment of frustration, having been evicted without the usual 90
days' notice, this song was produced by some Juniper Girls. If
you're still wondering "Who's Movin'?" .... WE ARE!
COME TO OUR HOUSECOOLING AFTER THE
GAME SATURDAY!
