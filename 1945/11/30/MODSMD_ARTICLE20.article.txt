### CATHRYN OWEN 
Along about next week, you're going to realize that
this is the time of the year when your poor oF mother
is out chopping down sticky green trees and selling
them on the street corners. Tests and term papers by
any other name still smell even though the name is
Christmas.
The main problem will be shopping, not only be
cause all roads from the campus will have been
blocked, but because the bank account will definitely
lack that certain little something.
Here are some hints for making personalized gifts
right in your own room. All necessary materials may
be found in any normal house or dorm.
First there's the problem of mother. She'll probably
appreciate some little thing to brighten up the house
in the evenings when she comes in from a hard day
in the woods. The only materials needed for this are
a phonograph record and an old civ book. A record
ing of Guy Lombardo or Sammy Kaye would probably
add a wholesome touch. Place the civ book on a well
heated radiator and then lay the record on the book.
A few minutes of heating, the record begins to sag
and take the shape of the book, and voila—mama has
a new flower pot.
Now something for the father. Why not make
something nice and masculine and mechanical look

ing? The main material is one, rather loosely spi
raletl bed spring. Tear from the front portion of
your roommate's bet!—il isn't good for her head to
bounce around anyway. Next, a radio tube. Stick
the tube into one end of the spring, and there you
have a darned good-looking monster. Useful, too, as
a toothbrush rack. You might stick the roommate's
toothbrush through the springs, just so there won't
be a chance of confusion on the part of the receiver.
You'll want something bright and gay for that serv
iceman overseas —something like a necklace maybe.
You might start down the hall with a chisel, stopping
at each room with different colored walls, and chipping
a small square of that plaster off. Then you bore holes
through the squares with some little device from the
kitchenette and string them on strips of those attrac
tive glass curtains. Servicemen can exchange these
necklaces for just all kinds of things with the natives.
If you have a girl friend with sort of hlondish
brownish-greyish hair making an attractive gift
should be no problem at all. Down the hall behind
u "Student Cleaning Equipment" sign you'll find a
blondish-brownish-greyish mop. Clip several thick
strands and braid, and there you have a set of arti
ficial pigtails, or an artificial coronet. For a fluffy,
well-washed look, the mop should be damp during
the braiding process.
Of course, this home-made gift idea becomes a prob
lem if you have too many friends. To simplify mat
ters, you might just send them all souvenir plates from
the dining room.
See ya next year.

ing? The main material is one, rather loosely spi
raletl bed spring. Tear from the front portion of
your roommate's bet!—il isn't good for her head to
bounce around anyway. Next, a radio tube. Stick
the tube into one end of the spring, and there you
have a darned good-looking monster. Useful, too, as
a toothbrush rack. You might stick the roommate's
toothbrush through the springs, just so there won't
be a chance of confusion on the part of the receiver.
You'll want something bright and gay for that serv
iceman overseas —something like a necklace maybe.
You might start down the hall with a chisel, stopping
at each room with different colored walls, and chipping
a small square of that plaster off. Then you bore holes
through the squares with some little device from the
kitchenette and string them on strips of those attrac
tive glass curtains. Servicemen can exchange these
necklaces for just all kinds of things with the natives.
If you have a girl friend with sort of hlondish
brownish-greyish hair making an attractive gift
should be no problem at all. Down the hall behind
u "Student Cleaning Equipment" sign you'll find a
blondish-brownish-greyish mop. Clip several thick
strands and braid, and there you have a set of arti
ficial pigtails, or an artificial coronet. For a fluffy,
well-washed look, the mop should be damp during
the braiding process.
Of course, this home-made gift idea becomes a prob
lem if you have too many friends. To simplify mat
ters, you might just send them all souvenir plates from
the dining room.
See ya next year.
Along about next week, you're going to realize that
this is the time of the year when your poor oF mother
is out chopping down sticky green trees and selling
them on the street corners. Tests and term papers by
any other name still smell even though the name is
Christmas.
The main problem will be shopping, not only be
cause all roads from the campus will have been
blocked, but because the bank account will definitely
lack that certain little something.
Here are some hints for making personalized gifts
right in your own room. All necessary materials may
be found in any normal house or dorm.
First there's the problem of mother. She'll probably
appreciate some little thing to brighten up the house
in the evenings when she comes in from a hard day
in the woods. The only materials needed for this are
a phonograph record and an old civ book. A record
ing of Guy Lombardo or Sammy Kaye would probably
add a wholesome touch. Place the civ book on a well
heated radiator and then lay the record on the book.
A few minutes of heating, the record begins to sag
and take the shape of the book, and voila—mama has
a new flower pot.
Now something for the father. Why not make
something nice and masculine and mechanical look
