## Daily Staff Selects Mural Grid Squads 
### BOB GILKEY 
Like the month of March, the intramural football program at Stanford
this fall "came in like a lion and went out like a lamb." Starting off in
grand style wit!) three lull leagues composed of seven teams apiece, the
program soon found itself in competition with varsity athletics, and interest
slacked oil' to such a point that the playoffs between the champions of
each of the three circuits were not even completed.
To the Kappa-Dee Gee Mashers, Encina 11, and Medics 111 go the
laurels for emerging on lop in the three leagues. Of this trio of winners,
however, only the Kappa-Dee Gees ranked far above the rest of (he field.
In League 11, ho(h Encina II and (lie HilKoppers came down the home
stretch unbeaten, while in League 111, Medics 111 and Army both ap-

" proached the final afternoon of
play with a clean slate. The
League II title til( found (he En
cinans upsetting (he favored Hill
toppers by a 20-13 count, and in
League 111 (he underdog again
triumphed when (he Medics hand
ed Stanford's G.l.'s a 13-6 pasting.
The playoffs were supposed to be
conducted on a round-robin basis,
but only one game, between the
Kappa-Dee Gees and Encina 11, was
ever played. In this contest, the
powerful hasher outfit rolled to a
26-6 victory to establish itself as
favorites for the mural champion
ship.
Outstanding players were nuiner
out in mural play this season, and
the selection of all-league honors
was no easy proposition. Several
strong contenders for all - league
honors turned out for varsity sports
midway through the season, and
several other stars did not begin to
compete until the program was well
under way, so in selecting our all
star aggregation, we were obliged to
take these factors into consideration.
Here are the top-ranking players
from whom we made our final se
lection:
League I—Joe Sher, Willie Davies,
Ed Luce, Rie Supple, Denny Fox,
and John Hanlon of the Kappa-Dee
Gees; Doc Mason of Medics I; Jack
Woods, Pete Brown, and Bernie
Campbell of the 8.8.C. Fills; and
Don Lipelt of Encina 111.
League II — Bill Lundquist, Ed
Lefcourt, Ray Winterhalter, and A 1
Rau of Encina II; Ernie Webb, Bob
Slobe, A 1 Holubar, Dick Jones, Doug
Snell, and Milt Levy of the Hill
toppers; Francis Ganahl of Jeffer
son; and Chuck Magnuson of En
cina I.
League lll—Joe Ignatius and Dick
Vanderhoof of Medics III; Dick
Thies and Bob Davis of Army; Nick
Golubin and Johnny Ehrlich of Bu
chanan; and Bill Ebersold and Harry
Borchers of Taft.

Thanks to Coach Bugge
To Coach Elwyn Bugge, director
of the intramural football program,
should go a vote of thanks for his
able efforts in organizing and man
aging the program. It was certainly
unfortunate that, through adverse
circumstances and lack of interest,
the murals had to fold so completely
at the end.
