### BOB SLOBE, Daily Sports Editor 
Well, the Daily Sports Staff and yours truly are closing out the books
for fall quarter 1945—G0d, what a quarter! As Stanford goes so goes the
Daily, and it seems both have weathered the storm caused by the war;
Sports writing is impossible to do if there are no sports to write about, and
all the sports staff could do was cover intramurals
The most notable advance during the last few months is the return
of the Indian to the athletic warpath, and had it not been for the fact
that fall quarter started in September, Farm rooters might have seen a
cardinal-clad team out on the gridiron fighting Cal for the famed Axe.
In about five weeks they will definitely have a chance to cheer the first
Stanford team to be in the Coast Conference since 1942. Coaches Everett
Dean and Marchie Schwartz have really done a fine job in developing the
material at hand, but their sights are not leveled entirely on victories
this year; they are looking ahead to the future in the hopes that a few
years might make it as great as the past. It is difficult to push aside (he
fact that Stanford lias been dormant athletically for three years, whereas
other schools, aided by Navy and Marine training programs, have been
able to continue fielding half-way decent" teams in all sports. They will
have the edge for a while—but just wail!
Even more encouraging is the fact that three years of inactivity haven't
harmed the Stanford spirit. Coach Schwartz hit the nail on the head when
he said, "If I had known that our football was going to get such support,
there might have been a Big Game this year." Such enthusiasm on the part
of Stanford students at the last rally has convinced me that it will not be
long before the "Big Red Machine" is again leading the conference in all
sports.
You know, it's a funny thing, but Stanford tradition seems (o have
something magic and more or less binding about it. I have talked to
many students who have gone to other schools during the war, and to a
man they seem to find it impossible to absorb the traditions of these
other schools. The Axe, no smoking on Quad, class rivalry, the Law
School steps, and, yes, even the Stanford woman are something that no
Stanfordite ever forgets; they are things that make the traditions of other
schools seem hollow. Students who have been away for a long time are
more than ever convinced that there is no place like the "Farm."
Last but not least, I would like to thank my sports staff of Art Levin
son, Bob Gilkey, A 1 Sciaroni, Jim Welter, and Stu Millar for the help they
have given me in turning out sports copy with an understaffed sports
department, for alas, the Daily was not able to meet the sports boom at
Stanford with a fully prepared staff.
Now for the All-American football team chosen by the Daily staff for
the 1945 season.
