# Dean, Anderson, Farm Basketball Heads, Sport Sucessful Careers

### STU MILLAR 
As far as qualified critics are con
cerned, there is no heed to look be
yond Everett Dean to find one of
the outstanding basketball coaches
in the nation.
After graduating from Indiana,
where he made the All-American
team in his junior and senior years,
Dean immediately found a coaching
job and started turning out good
teams.
Dean Successful from Start
He received A.B. and A.M. de
grees at Indiana University and
found his first coaching job at Carle
ton College. He won 49 out of 52
games in three years. Dean then
graduated to the big time by going
to his alma mater as head basketball
and baseball coach. He remained at
the Hoosier school until 1938 when
he came to Stanford. He took three
Big Ten titles in each of the sports
he coached, and his cage teams had
a composite league standing of sec
ond place for his entire tenure.
When last tabulated, the number
of games Dean had won totaled 321
against 124 losses, an average of .724.
While Dean was at Indiana he
developed many of America's' lead
ing mentors. Big-time teams that
now play in Madison Square Gar
den are tutored by coaches who
learned their basketball 2-plus-2's
from Dean.
Fast Break Featured
He has developed one of the most
elastic offensive and defensive sys
tems used on the courts today. Stan
ford's coach molds the plays and
patterns to fit the type of material
on hand and the type of opposition
that must be faced. Only static part
of the Dean system is the fast break.
His teams, starting back in 1922,
have used the fast break without
exception, and it has proved the de
ciding factor in more than one game.
One of the unusual features of
the Dean method is the fall practice
of the squad. Most coaches issue
calls for cagers some time in No
vember or early December, but
Dean has his men report in Septem
ber so that they can get in some
pre-schedule conditioning.
Run Laps for Stamina
The prospects run laps, play vol
leyball and softball, and become fa
miliar with each other's habits and
moves. This results in increased
stamina and wind, so necessary to
the fast break, and better team

work when the actual scrimmaging
starts.
Dean has been at Stanford for
eight years and has won for the
Farm more than one Southern Divi
sion championship. In the '41-'42
season, his Card team went on to
win the Pacific Coast and National
Collegiate titles after romping
through its own league schedule.
In his first four years here, Dean
chalked up 7S out of 105 games in
the win column.
Anderson on Way Up
Assistant Coach Forrest "Fordy"
Anderson is also on his way to a
successful coaching career. A top
flight high school player in the Mid
west, he broke a long-standing scor
ing record at Modesto J.C. -Coming
to Stanford, he played two years
under Dean, and was picked on the
All-Conference, Southern Division,
team along with his four mates in
the Stanford starting line-up.
He still has a year's eligibility left,
but he won't use it this season. He
can be of more use by helping Dean
weld the green material into a
smooth-working combination.
Won Coach-of-Year Award
After entering the Navy, Anderson
played for the Great Lakes team that
was rated number one in the nation.

Following a year's sea duly, Fordy
went back to the same team and
coached it to the top spot. For this
he received the "coach of the year"
award from the Chicago Basketball
Writers' Association.
Both of these coaches, progressive
and modern in their outlook and
methods, are well liked and respect
ed by their players. They are not
content to outline plays and defenses
to their charges with chalk, but ac
tively demonstrate their principles
on the floor.
