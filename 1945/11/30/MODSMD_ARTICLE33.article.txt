# ‘Remember, It’s We Who Die ..’

### 
Growing student interest in the
control of atomic energy came to a
head last night, as 17 vitally inter
ested students met in room 372 of
the Physics Building for the organi
zation of the Student Atomic Con
trol Alliance, Stanford Chapter.
At this meeting, which lasted for
more than three hours, Charles
Clark was elected chairman, and a
resolution was adopted by the group.
The resolution read as follows:
"We, the undersigned, realizing
the grave significance of the atom
ic bomb and recognizing the im
perative need for prompt, con
certed action for controlling atom
ic energy, do hereby establish a
group to be known as 'The Stu
dent Atomic Control Alliance,
Stanford Chapter.'
"We nereby resolve that we
shall help to speed the organiza
tion of an international atomic
power control in every possible
way, especially by mobilizing pub

lie- action.
"It is our firm conviction that
the most effective means for con
trolling atomic energy is through
the establishment of an interna
tional commission entrusted with
the control of atomic weapons and
their manufacture, with the power
to carry out whatever investiga
tions arc necessary to regulate the
use of atomic energy, and with the
power and means to take any ac
tion in order to preserve peace."
Clark said that it is the hope of
the organization that all students at
Stanford will join "The Student
Atomic Control Alliance, Stanford
Chapter." Vassar College has the
only other existing group of this
type and has been contacted by
Nancy Hand, newly elected inter
school co-ordinator, concerning pos
sibilities of national organization of
student groups.
Definite aims of the group in ad
dition to national organization of
student groups arc as follows:
(1) To sponsor all - student as
semblies at Stanford for free dis
cussion of atomic energy; and
(2) To endeavor to send out
speakers from the Alliance under
auspices of the Stanford Students'
Speakeis' Bureau to nearby commu
nities.
As Seville Chapman, professor of
physics, state, "Remember, it's we
who die."
