# ‘Sea Gull’ Given Fine Production
## 
### 
Even Anton Chekhov would have
given a nod of approval Wednesday
night to the production of his Rus
sian tragedy, "The Sea Gull." The
opening night audience saw an obvi
ously experienced cast of senior and
graduate students give a fine inter
pretation of the intriguing but de
pressing play of the great Russian
dramatist.
Involved love affairs and unre
quited love ran rampant throughout
the play. Only the servants of the
country estate, the setting for the
play, seemed untouched by the se
ries of infatuations.
Barbara Welch deserves high
praise for her ability in handling
her role as Madame Arcadina, a
bewitching actress of 43, whose
constantly changing moods carry
her suddenly from anger to love.
James Clancy as her lover Trigo
rin, the worldly, blase author, did
not have the meaty role his talents
deserved, although his acting abil
ity was given an opportunity to
when he expressed to the young
girl Nina the unsatisfaction his
success had brought him.
The love of Madame Arcadina's
son, TreplefT, as portrayed by Wil
liam Melton, for Nina (Patricia
Nielsen) overshadowed that of his
mother for Trigorin. Both Melton
and Miss Nielsen handled their roles
with depth and sincerity. Melton's
facial expressions were excellent,
but his gestures could have been
more polished. Miss Nielsen made a
very appealing young girl whose ill
fated love for Trigorin brought her
nothing but misery. Although the
Russions are considered to be an
emotional people, both Melton and
Miss Nielsen over-acted somewhat
at times. Their skill, however, in
handling the difficult roles over
shadowed any minor flaws.
One of the most outstanding ac
tors of the play was Walter Pa
lance in his supporting role of Dr.
Dorn. He portrayed one of the few
stable characters in a group of
excitable, emotional Russians. Pa
lance's complete naturalness on
the stage was impressive, to say
the least. His interpretation of the
part was not only excellent, but
his appearance, as well, exactly
Fitted his role as a once-dashing,
strikingly handsome man in his
middle fifties.
Howard Campbell deserves spe
cial mention for his portrayal of the
lovable old brother of Madame Ar
cadina, reminiscent of Alexander
Woolcott.
' Stage settings for the first act,

representing the grounds of So
rin's country estate, were carefully
designed to fit the small stage of
the Little Theater, and yet con
veyed naturalness. The interior
of the house, shown in acts three
and four, was a detailed replica
of a Russian home of the 1890's.
The lighting as the hour changed
from sunset to evening and when
a light was brought into the dim
interior of the house was particu
larly effective.
Surely Director F. Cowles
Strickland and the Stanford Play
ers' staff deserve much of the
credit for the fine performance of
the cast. "The Sea Gull" showed a
smoothness and artistry usually
not found in a college production.

fated love for Trigorin brought her
nothing but misery. Although the
Russions are considered to be an
emotional people, both Melton and
Miss Nielsen over-acted somewhat
at times. Their skill, however, in
handling the difficult roles over
shadowed any minor flaws.
One of the most outstanding ac
tors of the play was Walter Pa
lance in his supporting role of Dr.
Dorn. He portrayed one of the few
stable characters in a group of
excitable, emotional Russians. Pa
lance's complete naturalness on
the stage was impressive, to say
the least. His interpretation of the
part was not only excellent, but
his appearance, as well, exactly
Fitted his role as a once-dashing,
strikingly handsome man in his
middle fifties.
Howard Campbell deserves spe
cial mention for his portrayal of the
lovable old brother of Madame Ar
cadina, reminiscent of Alexander
Woolcott.
' Stage settings for the first act,

representing the grounds of So
rin's country estate, were carefully
designed to fit the small stage of
the Little Theater, and yet con
veyed naturalness. The interior
of the house, shown in acts three
and four, was a detailed replica
of a Russian home of the 1890's.
The lighting as the hour changed
from sunset to evening and when
a light was brought into the dim
interior of the house was particu
larly effective.
Surely Director F. Cowles
Strickland and the Stanford Play
ers' staff deserve much of the
credit for the fine performance of
the cast. "The Sea Gull" showed a
smoothness and artistry usually
not found in a college production.

Even Anton Chekhov would have
given a nod of approval Wednesday
night to the production of his Rus
sian tragedy, "The Sea Gull." The
opening night audience saw an obvi
ously experienced cast of senior and
graduate students give a fine inter
pretation of the intriguing but de
pressing play of the great Russian
dramatist.
Involved love affairs and unre
quited love ran rampant throughout
the play. Only the servants of the
country estate, the setting for the
play, seemed untouched by the se
ries of infatuations.
Barbara Welch deserves high
praise for her ability in handling
her role as Madame Arcadina, a
bewitching actress of 43, whose
constantly changing moods carry
her suddenly from anger to love.
James Clancy as her lover Trigo
rin, the worldly, blase author, did
not have the meaty role his talents
deserved, although his acting abil
ity was given an opportunity to
when he expressed to the young
girl Nina the unsatisfaction his
success had brought him.
The love of Madame Arcadina's
son, TreplefT, as portrayed by Wil
liam Melton, for Nina (Patricia
Nielsen) overshadowed that of his
mother for Trigorin. Both Melton
and Miss Nielsen handled their roles
with depth and sincerity. Melton's
facial expressions were excellent,
but his gestures could have been
more polished. Miss Nielsen made a
very appealing young girl whose ill
fated love for Trigorin brought her
nothing but misery. Although the
Russions are considered to be an
emotional people, both Melton and
Miss Nielsen over-acted somewhat
at times. Their skill, however, in
