# Stuart Officially Named Special Envoy To Tangier
## 
### MARY ANN McCOMB 
Graham Stuart, professor of po- |
j litical science, yesterday received j
I his official designation as a special J
assistant to the diplomatic agent at I
Tangier, from James Byrnes, Secre
tary of State. Mr. Stuart will make
a study of the status of Tangier
which will aid in drafting a new
international statute for that city.
Mr. Stuart will first go to Wash
ington where he will spend several
days consulting with Mr. J. Reeves
Childs, who has just returned from
Tangier. He will then fly to Morocco
in an Army transport, going by way
of the Azores and Casablanca.
Modern City
According to Mr. Stuart, Tangier
I is a very attractive city in peace
time. It has a climate like Califor
nia's, and excellent hotels, beaches,
golf course and a casino that in
normal times would bw attractive to
tourists. The health conditions are
good, due mainly to the fact that
foreign representatives have been in
charge of the street sanitation, sew
' erage, market supply, and other such
: public utilities.
Although the United States has
never recognized the Tangier zone
as a special entity, we have played
a leading role in bringing about its
internationalization. For over a cen
tury the United States has taken the
lead in controlling the Sanitary
Council.
International Lighthouse
Similarly, the Uniled States joined
with nine other powers to adminis
ter the lighthouse at Cape Spartel
through an international commis
sion. Each year for three-quarters
of a century the Congress of the
United States has appropriated
money for its maintenance.
The Sultan of Morocco expressed
a desire to turn over his entire em- j
pire as a protectorate to the United
States 74 years ago. We, however, ,
refused to accept this transatlantic
responsibility. Mr. Stuart states
that the internationalization of Tan
gier came about as the result of two
factors: the rivalries of European
powers, particularly France, Spain,
j and Great Britain, and the special
status of the city due to the sub
stantial control of its institutions
exercised by the diplomatic corps.
! Spain Withdraws
Last August the Conference of
I Experts on Tangier, representing
i the United States, the United King
; doin, France, and the U.S.S.R., met
I in Paris and adopted a number of
[ resolutions looking toward the re
establishment of the international i
regime in Tangier. As a result of a '
communication sent to Spain by j

v m
1 these countries, the Spanish govern
i ment withdrew from unilateral oc- I
j cupation of Tangier and turned over '
j the administration of the Interna- ]
tional Zone to the Committee of j
Control. The Spanish government,
however, also made known its ad
herence and will participate in the
provisional regime as established by
the Conference at Paris.
The United States is represented
on the Committee of Control by Mr.
Paul H. Ailing, American diplomatic
agent and consul general at Tan
gier. The Committee of Control has
elected a Portuguese national as ad
ministrator of the zone, and a Bel
gum national as assistant adminis
trator for finance.
International Area
Tliis is the first time that the
United States and Russia have col
laborated officially in the governing
of Tangier. Mr. Stuart believes that
Tangier will remain an international
area, probably outside the United
Nations Organization at least tem
porarily. From observing this area
we should be able to see how an in
ternational organization has worked

I
in the past and how it can work in
| the future.
j Mr. Stuart wrote "The Interna
j tional City of Tangier," the only
! book written in English about Tan
gier. This book was put out by the
Stanford Press which has also is
sued "The Shanghai Problem" by
William Johnstone, a Stanford grad
uate. The Stanford Press is now in
the process of putting out "Danzig
Dilemma" by John Brown Mason,
j who replaced Mr. Stuart last year.
It is interesting to note that with
the publishing of the last buok, the
Stanford Press will have issued the
only English volumes on the three
international cities of the world.
