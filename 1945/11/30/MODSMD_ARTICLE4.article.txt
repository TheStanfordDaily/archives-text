I quainted" dancc at the Women's
I Clubhouse. Dates arc superfluous
I for the affair is a no-date, no-ad
mission dancc.
"The time has come," said Excom
last week, "for the spread-out fresh
men class to really get to know one
another." Without further discus
sion Excom and Tom Elke, fresh
men president, put their heads to
| gether to plan a big get-to-gether.
It's to be no ordinary dance even
if the couples do have to dancc to a
juke box, because Elke promises
something unusual in stunts.
And for the freshmen who would
j rather cat than dance, the refresh
ment table will be placed in an ac
i eessible corner.
Al Green will serve at master of
ceremonies for the evening. The re
freshment committee is headed by
Alice Coutch; the music department
is being handled by George Eck
stein. Glen Fishback and Alex
Chappie will supervise the decora
tions; Bob Beard, Herb Harband,
and Al Green, the entertainment.
