## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
Fall onarler l!) 45 will be re
membered as the quarter when
tin' ratio changed, when the N.R.
O.T.C. came to the Farm and the
A.S.T.P. left, when football, bas
ketball, and the old Indian spirit,
which had lain dormant during
the war years, returned with re
newed strength.
Welcoming Marchie Schwartz, the
football coach, and Everett Dean,
basketball coach, back to the Farm,
Stanford held the first big Indian
rally since the war ended. Indians

and papooses whooped it up. sang
the old fight songs, and joined in the
yells under the leadership of Ric
Supple, master of ceremonies, and
Newt Arnold, head yell leader.
Another rally and torchlight pa
rade down the Row sent the Car
dinals onto the gridiron to give
the veteran Stockton Commandos
a hard battle.
Brainier Hall made history with
its "Peppermint Ball" formal.
Bubbling brews, witches on
broomsticks, goblins, and black
cats fulfilled the ' Black Magic"
theme of the Lagunita-Union for
mal. Roble's "Forty-Niner" Ball
took freshmen back to the days of
doors and murals of can-can girls.
The Navy unit on campus was en
tertained by an open house at Ven
tura and dances at Branner and Un
ion. The N.R.O.'s in return took the
campus on deck for its "Bell-Bot 7
torn Ball.''
The A.S.T.P. ceme through with
its Friday night dances at the Pavil
ion and two firesides at Eneina. Ri
valry between the two service units;
finally culminated in a six-man
touch pigskin tussle with the Navy

winning by a very close margin.
Using the theme "A Girl in Ev
ery Port," the traditional Farm
Gaieties, directed by Mary Lou
Patton, took Stanford students on
an imaginary trip through Alaska,
Russia, Venice, France, Cuba, and
back home again to Pier No. 44 on
Lake Lagunita.
The sophomores had their day.
Juniors and seniors have yet to set
tle their differences at the Junior-
Senior Party tonight. Tomorrow the
Red Machine will roll again for the
last time this year with the aid of
Stanford rooters. Finally the Red
and White Ball, sponsored by Car
| dinals, will climax the social activi
ties of fall quarter 1945.
Now the leaves on the Row and
in front of Lagunita are turning red,
brown, and rust. Stanford students
are getting in those last precious
minutes of study before finals.
Christmas holidays, a new year, and
a new quarter lie ahead.
