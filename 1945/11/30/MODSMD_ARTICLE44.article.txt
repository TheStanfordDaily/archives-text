# Jukebox in Cellar May Go if Not Used
## 
### 
If the Cellar ilike box is not
played more often, it will have to
lie removed, Student Manager B.
J. Calfee revealed yesterday. At
present, Miss Calfee said, the juke
box is not even paying for itself.
Funds from the juke box go to
ward paying the boathouse debt.
Students may play it during all
Cellar hours except mealtimes,
Miss Calfee said.
