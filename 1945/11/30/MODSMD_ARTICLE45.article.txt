# Scientists in Demand, Top Officials Reveal
## 
### GEORGE BRUNN HELEN PINKERTON 
Scientists — chemists, physicists
and engineers — s?em to have the
best opportunities for immediate
employment, a tour of leading Bay
Area industries this week revealed.
Reporters from the San Jose Spar
tan, Daily Californian and the Stan
ford Daily interviewed leading ex
ecutives of nine concerns on specific
employment problems and openings
in a two-day tour sponsored by the
National Association of Manufactur
ers.
General Electric, which hires 155 ft
technically trained men and wom
en. such as chemists, engineers,
metallurgists, and physicists, as
well as 10ft business graduates,
from 130 accredited colleges an
nually, has the most detailed
training program of any concern
visited.
According to Robert O. Brosemer,
assistant district engineer in charge
of college hiring, scientsts are given
practical experience testing a large
variety of products, including mo
tors, gunfire control, and radio
transmitters. At the same time they
are given opportunity to continue
their classroom work, which, how
ever, cannot be used toward an ad
vanced degree.
Scientists receiving this training
receive a starting wage of $1.00 an
hour if they are '44 or '45 graduates.
A 1940 graduate who has not worked

for G.E. previously starts at $G0 a
,veek.
Newly hired men and women usu
ally spend about three years in
Schenectady before going out into
the branch plants.
During the war this program has
been discontinued and 30ft men
were "frozen" on testing, one
phase of the program, and in order
to move them on to design engi
neering that many new men must
be taken on. Mr. Brosemer said
the hiring will be of returning
veterans and recent college grad
uates.
The company has recently insti
tuted a research training program
consisting of rotating assignments
for a period of IS to 24 months to
provide the research workers with
a complete picture of the concern.
He added that G.E. prefers gradu
ates who have not over-specialized.
Eight to ten men are hired annu
ally by G.E. from Stanford and
about the same number from Cali
fornia. Hiring is based on charac
ter, scholastic and activity record
•2nd a personal interview.
The company also has a three
year business training course con
ducted in co-operation with the
Havard Business School. Both
men and women are eligible for
this course, which is divided be
tween practical work and night
classes. However, he pointed out
that most women hired for this
course are from Eastern universi
ties.
General Electric has recently ac
quired 57 acres in San Jose for a
new manufacturing plant and is also
planning to bui'd a plant at Ana
heim. At the same time, Mr. Brose
mer announced the formation of a
new advertising and publicity de
partment which will provide train
ing opportunities.
A minimum of twenty college
graduates a year are hired by Cali
fornia Research Corporation, a sub
sidiary of Standard Oil of Califor
nia, according to its director, A. L.
Lyman. He listed as positions at the
Richmond laboratory those of chem
ist, physical chemist, mechanical en
gineer, electrical engineer, civil en
gineer, metallurgist, physicist, libra
rian and translator.
Starling salary in the lab is S'Mft
a month for chemists and engi
neers. Further opportunities in
personnel, secretarial and mana
gerial work are offered by the
j.arcnt company, Standard Oil of
California.
Other firms which offer employ
ment in scientific fields are Califor
nia Packing Corporation, in its

plants for chemists, and Crown Zel
lerbach for chemists, m»n and wom
en trained in mechanical and chem
ical engineering.
Crown Zellerbach, its Vice-Presi
den A. D. Lay ton, Stanford '24, said,
also conducts a paper-making school
with diplomas accredited by the
University of Washington.
In seeking employment with a
large corporation such as Crown
Zellerbach, Mr. Layton advised
that the young person be pre
pared to go anywhere the work
calls him and to start with an un
spectacular position.
R. H. Biggs, manager of Oakland's
R. C. Capwell department store, em
phasized the advisability of trying
to obtain a position as salesman or
buyer rather than as an executive.
"We can have only one or two head
men," he said, "but we employ
around 250 buyers and even moro
sales personnel."
"The clothing business is for peo
ple who value independence over
security and routine," commented
Aclolph A. Schumann, president of
Lilli - Ann Manufacturing Company
in San Francisco, pointing to the
large salaries for designers, mod
els, salesmen, and an enterpriser
can still start with "800 bucks and
a prayer."
