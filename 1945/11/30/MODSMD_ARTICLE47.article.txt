To interi ret the spirit of America
to the people of Germany and to
work seriously at the job of build
ing bridges of understanding will be
the new work of Dr. D. Elton True
blood, chaplain oi Stanford Univer
sity, when lie leaves at the end of |
this quarter to travel abroad.
Dr. Trueblood came to Stanford |
in June 193(5, and has been chaplain
here for over nine years. "These
have been wonderful years of our
lives. We shall be grateful to Stan- ,
ford and to Stanford men and
women as long as we live, he said.
To Indiana l it st
On completing his last day as
chaplain on Dec. 14. Dr. Trueblood]
will travel to Indiana to make prep
arations for his overseas trip. He
will tour England, France, Switzer- i
land, and travel extensively in Ger
many, delivering addresses and in- i
tei preting, as occasion permits, the j
spirit of America.
While in Germany, he expects to
come in contact with many anti- j
Nazi persons who defied Hitler's rule j
throughout the war period. Among
those he will visit will be Pastor
Martin NiemoeJler, the famous i
preacher who was imprisoned for
tight years bccau.se he would not |
comply with the Fuehrer's edicts.
Dr. Trueblood stated that he has

dreamed of doing such work since
the war began, because he believes
I that those who care about peace
must work at the job. "Peace does
i not maintain itself, but must be
built," he asserted.
"Immediately after my resignu-
I tion from Stanford I volunteered for
I foreign service in the American
| Friends Service Committee, and my
offer was accepted in September by
j the Board of Directors," he said.
With Friends Service Committee
Members of the American Friends
Service Committee are men and
women who are selected to do such
work as feeding and clothing the
j needy in war-torn lands, and help
j 'ng to rehabilitate the lives of the
inhabitants. This year, Dr. True
blood will be in Germany to plan for
I the introduction of this relief in so
! far as the American Service Com-
S mittee is able to do this work.
; Next Post: Earlham College
Upon his return from Europe next
! lutumn, Dr. Trueblood will take
j over the position of professor of phi
losophy at Earlham College in Rich
! mond, Indiana. Dr. Trueblood will
| be given a "roving professorship"
j which will permit, him to time to
: write, travel, and accept speaking
I engagements half of each year.
A natural connection is provided
for Dr. Trueblood at Earlham Col
j lege, as some member of his family
has been on the faculty staff since
its founding 98 years ago.

cr, "The Predicament of Modern [
] Man." He has written a sequel to
