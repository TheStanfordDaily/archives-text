# Stanford Men Aid Radar Development
## 
### 
Stanford faculty members and |
graduates took a leading, part in j
the development of radar counter- ;
measures during the war, it was dis- j
closed this week when the super- |
secret scientific project at Radio !
Research Institute at Harvard Uni- j
versity was made public.
Frederick E. rurman. Dean of the
i
j School of Engineering, headed a staff
j 'if 270 technicians, engineers and
i scientists including five Stanford j
' faculty men and 36 graduatesâ€”more j
| than from any other university in
the country.
From the Department of Electrical I
Engineering were Dr. Tcrman; Karl j
i Spangenberg, head of a group re- ,
j sponsible for research and develop- j
! mcnt of micro-wave oscillators and j
| filters; S. W. Athcy, head of the mo- ;
! tion picture group, which made
i training films; O. G. Villard, Jr.,
member of the liaison division at the j
i laboratory and in the ETO with the j
; U.S. strategic air forces.
From the Physics Department i
were Dr. Felix Bloch, associate ,
| group leader of the theoretical di- J
vision, and Morton Hamermesh, in-
I structor in physics.
One of the Stanford graduates, W.
i B. Caulfield, '41, was killed in ac
j tion while working with the Ninth
Air Force.
Francis C. Cabi 11 and Joseph M.
Pettit, both division heads at the
laboratory, also served as associate
technical directors in the branch
laboratory which was set up in
| England. Other division leaders
j were George E. Hulstcde, Richard S.
! O'Brien and Edwin A. Yunker.
Other Stanford graduates, some'
1 of whom have already returned to
the campus, included:
Robert B. Barnes, Lt. J. B. Bisby, I
Robert R. Buss, Harold F. Elliott, i
Charles F. Hadley, Robert H. Ham- i
mett, Peter Harbury, Walter Far- |
rail, Lt. E. M. Fryer, Milton D. Hare,
, R. M. Hcintz, Price M. Keclcr, Rob- j

MacQuivay, Laurence A. Manning, .
Charles F. Otis. Horace Ovcrackcr. .

nolds, William R. Rambo, P. Paul
Robbiano, Robert A. Sodcrman. J
John G. Stephenson, Roljcrt Wein- i

stock, William B. Wholey, France. 1
Wrightson, and John Wcddel.
Counter - measures developed at
RCM were of two general types:
aluminum foil, called "window," and
electronic detectors and jammers.
Allied use of window became pub
lic knowledge during the war, but
the recent announcement revealed
on what a vast scale it was used.
The most spectacular demonstra
tion of RCM was on D-Day when a
huge anti - radar jamming and
bombing blitz smashed German ra
dar along the coast of France.
