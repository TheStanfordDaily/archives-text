! under the recommendations of the
I committee. Two students will also
be appointed to the committee.
The committee has already out
! lined the intramural activities for
i the winter quarter. First on the
list will he basketball, which will
start about the second week of
the quarter. Preceding the open
ing of the league there will he a
basketball "clinic" under the di
rection of Coach Dean. The pur
pose of the clinic will be to
instruct prospective intramural
players in some of the tricks of the
game, and also instruct those who
plan to officiate at the games so
that there will be a maximum of '
efficiency in refereeing the con
-1 tests.
Besides the intramural activities,
the committee has also set forth
! plans for interclass competition. In-
I eluded in the interclass events will
be swimming, wrestling, golf, gym
nastics. and topping the program off
will be a huge interclass "Sports
: Day." â– 
Biggest of the events of "Sports
j Day" will be a revival of the "Irish
i Marathon." This is an event which
has not been known at Stanford for
I the past few years, but in its day
i was a big event on campus. The
marathon is made up of 20 to 25
men from each class. Each man runs
a quarter of a mile. Some of the
other events of the day will be
j wheelbarrow, potato, and three-leg
j ged :'aces.
For both interclass and intra
i mural contests at least one mem- j
her of the committee will be pros- |
j ent. It has also been announced
that the pay of student officials at
the games will be increased, and
that a fund is being set up to ob
tain an adequate number of suit- i
able trophies for the winners of
the different contests.
At the start of next quarter the
I committee is going to arrange to
meet the men in each of the living |
j groups at smokers or some other
suitable function at the halls. They
will explain the details of the pro
j gram in order to get every student I
I interested in the program, and also
| to take any suggestions from the
I students which might improve it.
