# Army in Hawaii ‘Least Prepared’
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (UP).—
The Army submitted reports to the
Pearl Harbor inquiry today indicat
ing that of all its commands, the
Hawaiian Department was the least
prepared for a Japanese sneak at
tack on Dec. 7, 1941.
The reports were presented to the
i joint congressional committee when
I its counsel called Maj. Gen. Sherman
Miles to testify. Miles, chief of G-2
I (Army Intelligence) between May.
| 1940, and January, 1942, was sum
' moned to tell what his department
j did to warn commanders in the Pa
cific and elsewhere of the increas
ing dangers of a Japanese attack.
The records showed that the War
Department on Nov. 27, 1941 - ten
! days before the attack—had warned
i field commanders in the Panama Ca
nal Zone, th«' Philippines, the West
Coast and Hawaii that "hostile ac
tion is possible at any moment."
Tie warning came from Gen.
George C. Marshall, then chief oi
I staff, who will be a witness before
J he leaves shortly for China as Presi
| lent Truman's personal ambassador.
Marshall's urgent, confidential mes
sage advised that while we wanted
Japan to commit the first overt act,
! all defensive measures should be
i taken without alarming the civilian
j populations.
j Replies from all commands except
Hawaii reported extensive defensive
measures. But that from Maj. Gen.
Walter C. Short, Army commander
1 at Pearl Harbor, reported that his
command had been alerted only
against sabotage.
Miles, tall and bespectacled, testi
fied in a deep, booming voice. He
was called after the committee com

pleted its questioning of Joseph
Grew, last ambassador to Tokyo.
Grew said that although he did not
receive a Dec. 5 message from
Washington ordering the destruc
tion of the embassy's secret codes, he
had destroyed them before Pearl
Harbor day on his own initiative.
Some of the codes he had ordered
destroyed, he said, when it becamc
certain that U.S.-Japanese
were almost at the breaking point.
