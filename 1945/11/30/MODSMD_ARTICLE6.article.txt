# Stan Kenton To Play for Reg Dance; New Plans Made for Registration
## 
### 
A dance January 5 featuring Stan
Kenton's orchestra in the Basketball
Pavilion will replace the traditional
Reg Dance and will be the climax of
the new registration plan for winter
quarter, Cardinals announced. Other
changes in the program deal with
registration procedure.
According to the new plan regis
tration books will be available at
8 a.m. for the following groups:
1. All Lower Division students.
2. All students registering for the
first time at Stanford.
3. All students who have been
registered previously at Stanford,
but were not registered autumn

quarter.
Registration books will be avail
able beginning at 1 p.m. for all
other students (Upper Division and
graduate students who were regis
tered at Stanford autumn quarter,
1945).
The photographer will be on duty
in Room 122 throughout the day
(only those who have not had pho
tographs taken need be photo
graphed).
Before the war, the traditional Reg
Dance took place the evening of
Registration Day, and was a no
date "jolly-up." During the war this
was replaced by a dance on the

Saturday after registration, held in
the Women's Gym to the strains of
"canned music." The addition of a
big-name Dand is another of the
improvements brought about by
Stanford's return to normalcy.
Lyle Davis and Frank de Lisle
have been appointed co-chairmen in
charge of the opening dance. They
have announced that the Pavilion
will not be decorated and the only
theme of the dance will be "Cardi
nals Present Stan Kenton." Bar
bara Emmons has been appointed
chairman of the committee for pat
rons and patronesses.
