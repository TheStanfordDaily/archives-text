Stanford's abbreviated football schedule comes to a climax
this Saturday when the Farm eleven runs up against the in
vading Merchant Marine Academy team from San Mateo at
2 p.m. in the Stadium. The contest is rated strictly a toss-up, but
collegiate partisanship forces us to pick Stanford as the winner.

Drive, the arches of Inner Quad, and
red and white streamers will gleam
to remind everyone of the finals
soon to be taken in the classrooms
of the Farm.
The theme for the Red and
White Ball will be carried out in
red and white refreshments, deco
rations, and spirit, according to
the chairmen.
Skinnay Ennis and his 17-piece
orchestra will provide the music.
Ennis, formerly vocalist with Hal
Kemp's orchestra, has played for the
Bob Hope show for the past five
years. ( Vocalist with Ennis is Car
men, a songstress formerly on the
radio and vocalist with Henry King's
orchestra.
