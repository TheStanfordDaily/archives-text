### 
MofTett Field's mighty skymastcrs
pushed the Stanford basketball team
from basket to basket last night in
the Pavilion as they won a free
scoring contest by a score of to
46. The experience of the visitors
was too much, and they capitalized
on every Indian error to run up the
score.
Don Williams, former Stanford
cage star, paced the visitors offen
sively and defensively, scoring 17
points and holding the whole team
together. Dean Chapman, towering
cx-Caltech ace, was tough under
the bucket as he rang up 11 mark

''MofTett Field played a fine game
and easily deserved to win," said
Coach Everett Dean after the wal
loping. "Donnie Williams and too
much experience made the differ
ence."
For the Cardinal aggregation, Jim
Hill, who swished through 12 points,
was the stand-out. King and O'Bri
en, who played against the rugged
Chapman, also did well, according
to Coach Dean.
Stanford's next encounter is with
San Jose State at the Pavilion, De
