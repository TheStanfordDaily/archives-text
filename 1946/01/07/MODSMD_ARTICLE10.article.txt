Displaying a keen offense, S C. j
piled up a heavy score in the first
tussle. Bobby Kloppcnburg, a sen
sational product from Marshall High

teammates to a victory over the j
Stanford five. High point man for j

Stanford's diminutive forward, who :
amassed 17 points.

hoop for 16 points, Tom Shanley—a i
veteran S.C. basketeer —made tre- j
mendous lone shots throughout the
game at Shrine Auditorium. Several j
times Stanford came through with 1
short rallies, but always Shanley
would come through with "hot
shots" to keep his team clearly

neither team accumulated any large
score. Jack Nichols, veteran U.S.C.
