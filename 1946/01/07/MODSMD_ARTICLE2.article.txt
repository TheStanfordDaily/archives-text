# Life Shows Ski Photos
## 
### 
Pictures and an article on Stan
ford's dry-skiing class of last quar
ter appeared in Life Magazine, De
cember 24. The pictures showed the
girls doing exercises to limber up
skiing muscles on straw rather than
snow.
One picture demonstrates an cx
crcise on how to get up after falling
and another shows the girls in the
class lifting their legs to improve
their balance and strengthen mus
cles in their logs and ankles.
Lois Williams is shown doing a
jump exercise and jump turn, and
Ruth Nyswander is pictured at
tempting a kick turn that fails and
results in a fall.
