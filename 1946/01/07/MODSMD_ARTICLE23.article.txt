## A
						NEW TIME 
### 
"When the men come back . . For four years we have
tacked ihat phrase before our plans for the postwar future of the
Farm, and on Reg Day it suddenly became outdated—we stood in
the old familiar lines with tweeds and cords predominating, two
to one. They're back, and "What a deal!"
Along with our welcome, we want to put a guestion to vet
erans, those who were here before the war, and those new to
Stanford. We know that you have something special to contribute
to the university, in the way of experience, appreciation of the
opportunities for social and intellectual growth, and primarily, a
more mature set of values. Will you use them?
The good-old-days which have been praised, damned and
verbally kicked around won't automatically reappear; because
it's a different world, and a different Stanford. But in the new
year, you're the men we want to see interested in your classes,
in campus activities, and in world-wide events, interested enough
to bury the last crumbling block of that unfortunate vestigial
remain, the Ivory Tower of apathy.
This faith in you is our welcome, and the best way we can
tell you how very good it is to have you with us again.—N.S.
