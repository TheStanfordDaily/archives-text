# Dr. Grayson Kefauver

### 
To estimate the loss to a nation or a university of such a man
as Grayson Kefauver, one could well count in terms of those per
sonally deprived at his death. In this case the persons are many,
and the sum of regret is high.
Men and women who knew him during his days of teaching
in Stanford classrooms have lost except in memory his progres
sive and energetic spirit; our faculty has lost a Dean who was
especially well-liked for his assignment to each man the work
he could do best; the profession has lost an energetic leader who
wanted his theories to stand the test of present-day life needs.
All those who will derive benefit from an educational, scientific
and cultural organization for the United Nations —an organization
to promote international understanding —have lost the man who
originated it, and perhaps worked hardest of all in its behalf.
All Stanford sincerely regrets the death of so well-liked and
distinguished a member of its Family,—bmv
