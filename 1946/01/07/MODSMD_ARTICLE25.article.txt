Several hundred students, graduates and married couples, are
eligible at the moment for the uncherished title of "victims of the
housing shortage," and we look hopefully to Palo Alto citizens to
deprive them of their eligibility by opening extra rooms to stu
dent boarders.
The Palo Alto Times and civic clubs have cooperated by bring
ing the problem to the public's attention; we would like to re
emphasize the immediate need for accommodations, and to thank
those Palo Altans who have already offered spare rooms for rent
to stranded students.
Arrangements may be made through the office of the Dean of
Students, P. A. 9411.—N.5.
