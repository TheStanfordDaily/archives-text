# BULL SESSION

### CATHRYN OWEN 
Turn off your radiators, chums, spring is here. The snow on
the foothills has melted and has routed little downward streams
for the irrigation of Roble's backyard. The various mud puddles
on campus have reached the proper consistency for making mud
pies. And you still haven't written those handkerchief, necktie,
and sox thank-you notes
Which, of course, brings us to the subject of various forms of
white Christmas, or three weeks in the outer world. According to
the Chronicle, Stanford gathered at Yosemite to "soak up the hot
sun, watch the parade of the latest colorful fashions and listen to
the schottisches and polkas played from the balcony." Well, let
California be California, and let the Chronicle sit this libel suit out.
There were, however, those people who headed North and did
a bit of literal soaking. Christmas cruises were featured in Ore
gon. You know, the type v/here you use a spruce tree as a mast,
< nd paddle up to the nearest power line to plug the tree lights
in. They hit a slight snag when it came to producing a Santa
Claus of the chimney type. They tried and tried—you know, tell
ing the visiting Stanfordites that this Claus man was a little too
heavy for water skiing, or that rowboats just weren't wired for
fireplaces but the incident created just a little bit of doubt and
disbelief.
After all this, we come back to find that Hinks have replaced
the Santa Claus who was afflicted with fits in their window before
Christmas, with a display of bathing suits.
Not to be forgotten, yet not to be discussed too thoroughly, is
New Year's Eve. Of course you've heard of the naive French
instructor whose first assignment for the quarter was to have each
of his elementary students describe in French the way in which
he or she celebrated New Year's Eve.
We don't quite know what registration has to do with vaca
tions or spring, but it certainly was, wasn't it? There were t,hose
old students registering who discounted the whole speedy situa
tion as a wild rumor, and insisted on serving their customary
< ight hours in the Ad Building. There were those women regis
tering, who took one look at the situpation, and ran out to find a
chaperone.
All in all, everyone was happy with the revised registration—
except the buildingful of returning students, nearly all of them
veterans, who spent the entire day standing in lines.

except the buildingful of returning students, nearly all of them
veterans, who spent the entire day standing in lines.
Turn off your radiators, chums, spring is here. The snow on
the foothills has melted and has routed little downward streams
for the irrigation of Roble's backyard. The various mud puddles
on campus have reached the proper consistency for making mud
pies. And you still haven't written those handkerchief, necktie,
and sox thank-you notes
Which, of course, brings us to the subject of various forms of
white Christmas, or three weeks in the outer world. According to
the Chronicle, Stanford gathered at Yosemite to "soak up the hot
sun, watch the parade of the latest colorful fashions and listen to
the schottisches and polkas played from the balcony." Well, let
California be California, and let the Chronicle sit this libel suit out.
There were, however, those people who headed North and did
a bit of literal soaking. Christmas cruises were featured in Ore
gon. You know, the type v/here you use a spruce tree as a mast,
< nd paddle up to the nearest power line to plug the tree lights
in. They hit a slight snag when it came to producing a Santa
Claus of the chimney type. They tried and tried—you know, tell
ing the visiting Stanfordites that this Claus man was a little too
heavy for water skiing, or that rowboats just weren't wired for
fireplaces but the incident created just a little bit of doubt and
disbelief.
After all this, we come back to find that Hinks have replaced
the Santa Claus who was afflicted with fits in their window before
Christmas, with a display of bathing suits.
Not to be forgotten, yet not to be discussed too thoroughly, is
New Year's Eve. Of course you've heard of the naive French
instructor whose first assignment for the quarter was to have each
of his elementary students describe in French the way in which
he or she celebrated New Year's Eve.
We don't quite know what registration has to do with vaca
tions or spring, but it certainly was, wasn't it? There were t,hose
old students registering who discounted the whole speedy situa
tion as a wild rumor, and insisted on serving their customary
< ight hours in the Ad Building. There were those women regis
tering, who took one look at the situpation, and ran out to find a
chaperone.
All in all, everyone was happy with the revised registration—
except the buildingful of returning students, nearly all of them
veterans, who spent the entire day standing in lines.
