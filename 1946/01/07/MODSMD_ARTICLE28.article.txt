# ON THE DISCS
## 
### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
This past month has been marked
by many newsworthy items in the
field of popular music. One of these
is the addition to the maestro class
of former TD drummer Buddy Rich.
Rich's venture is aided by the funds
of old-time pal Frank Sinatra to the
tune of $25,000. The band, which is
now engaged in Newark, has been
making a quite frantic attempt to
produce some good music.
On the air shows which we have
caught, the balancing of the mikes
has been atrocious and the over
powering effect of Buddy's tuba is
too much for even his most avid
fans. There are no soloists of note
although we would be tempted to
say Rich stole Charlie Shavers from
his old boss by the way his scream
ing trumpet man solos.
Sometimes above average, rarely
exciting, and with too much accen
tuation of the positive, this band has
to be given credit for attempting to
play some music of worth. If Buddy
will profit by Gene Krupa's experi
ence and learn to settle back and
use his skins for what they were
built instead of taking every solo
and break, then this group has a
good chance to make something of
itself in
GOO!) ENOUGH TO KEEP
Sunset Recording Company, the
small Los Angeles firm that has been
making so much progress in the field
of jazz has come up with the piano
"man" who we think will drag down
the new-star honors for his instru
ment during the coming year. He is
16-year-old Andre Previn whose
new disc with Dave Barbour and
John Simmons has been causing no
end of comment in the City of th«
Angels.
The tunes which were waxed were
two standards, "Blue Skies" and
"Good Enough to Keep," and al
though the former is the better of
the two, both give young Previn a
chance to demonstrate his fabulous
technique and his fine jazz concep
tion. If Andre doesn't disappear into
a music conservatory in February
when he graduates from high school,
then look for big things from him in
the "kingdom of swing." Dave Bar
bour. former big-band guitarist, now
residing in Los Angeles, takes plenty
of his wonderful single-string solo
stuff, and the depth that John Sim
mon's bass adds to the whole session
makes the record even more en
ioyable.
MUSICAL NOTES
Another dispatch from the jazz
front brings us the welcome news
that Red Norvo is joining the thun-

Id( ring herd of Woody Herman. Re
| placing Marjorie Hyams on vibes,
| Red will also front a small group
| taken from the band which jumps
i under the name of Red Norvo and
J 'lis Woodchopptrs.
Rumor has it that Kay Starr will
become the new Harry James vocal
ist replacing Anita Boyer who re
placed Kitty Kit lien. If this is true,
it will prove a great boost to the
sagging James aggregation, as Miss
Starr, formerly with Charlie Bar
net, is one of our better thrushes.
Also featured on one of the Horn's
recent waxings is vocalist Ruth
Haag. In case the name strikes an
unfamiliar note, she is also known
as Legs, Miss Pin-Up, and Mrs. Har
ry James.
Rex Stewart, long-time Ellington
standby, is reported to be leaving
the Duke's organization. The famous
cornet star has gone out on his own
and is leading a small combo in
New York. * * * The music world
was saddened last month by the
death of trombonist Jack Jenney.
Jenney, famous for his work with
Artie Shaw, was considered by many
to have been the greatest sliphorn
artist of them all.
STAN'S STANFORD STAND
Blasting the roof off our basket
ball pavilion last Saturday night
was Stan Kenton and his Artistry in
j Rhythm. Stan the Man, who has
i finally returned to his original style
| of music after a dismal attempt at
| commercialism, is a very good ex
j ample of the modern trend that has
been sweeping the country. Just
j behind Woody Herman, just ahead
| of Les Brown, this highly progres
sive band, with its tremendous brass
section anchored with a bass trom
bone, is gaining more popularity
with each successive stand.
The rhythm section, composed of
Ed Safranski on bass, Bub Ahern on
guitar, Ralph Collier on drums, and
Stan on piano, backs such soloists
as Vido Musso on tenor, Ray Whet
sel on trumpet, and Boots Mussillo
on alto with tremendous drive.
The\scoring for the brass often
gives one the impression that the
musicians are just trying their best
to make noise, but on closer inspec
tion one finds that a superlative ef
fect is desired and achieved. Stan,
with the help of Gene Howard,*does
the arrangements and the vocal
chores are very capably handled by
June Cristy, Ray Whetsel, and Mr.
Howard.
If this band continues reaching
i the heights is did here on the Farm,
j and Capitol keeps recording the
Kenton Krew the way it has in the
past, then they surely are the band
! we picks for '46.

GOO!) ENOUGH TO KEEP
Sunset Recording Company, the
small Los Angeles firm that has been
making so much progress in the field
of jazz has come up with the piano
"man" who we think will drag down
the new-star honors for his instru
ment during the coming year. He is
16-year-old Andre Previn whose
new disc with Dave Barbour and
John Simmons has been causing no
end of comment in the City of th«
Angels.
The tunes which were waxed were
two standards, "Blue Skies" and
"Good Enough to Keep," and al
though the former is the better of
the two, both give young Previn a
chance to demonstrate his fabulous
technique and his fine jazz concep
tion. If Andre doesn't disappear into
a music conservatory in February
when he graduates from high school,
then look for big things from him in
the "kingdom of swing." Dave Bar
bour. former big-band guitarist, now
residing in Los Angeles, takes plenty
of his wonderful single-string solo
stuff, and the depth that John Sim
mon's bass adds to the whole session
makes the record even more en
ioyable.
MUSICAL NOTES
Another dispatch from the jazz
front brings us the welcome news
that Red Norvo is joining the thun-

Id( ring herd of Woody Herman. Re
| placing Marjorie Hyams on vibes,
| Red will also front a small group
| taken from the band which jumps
i under the name of Red Norvo and
J 'lis Woodchopptrs.
Rumor has it that Kay Starr will
become the new Harry James vocal
ist replacing Anita Boyer who re
placed Kitty Kit lien. If this is true,
it will prove a great boost to the
sagging James aggregation, as Miss
Starr, formerly with Charlie Bar
net, is one of our better thrushes.
Also featured on one of the Horn's
recent waxings is vocalist Ruth
Haag. In case the name strikes an
unfamiliar note, she is also known
as Legs, Miss Pin-Up, and Mrs. Har
ry James.
Rex Stewart, long-time Ellington
standby, is reported to be leaving
the Duke's organization. The famous
cornet star has gone out on his own
and is leading a small combo in
New York. * * * The music world
was saddened last month by the
death of trombonist Jack Jenney.
Jenney, famous for his work with
Artie Shaw, was considered by many
to have been the greatest sliphorn
artist of them all.
STAN'S STANFORD STAND
Blasting the roof off our basket
ball pavilion last Saturday night
was Stan Kenton and his Artistry in
j Rhythm. Stan the Man, who has
i finally returned to his original style
| of music after a dismal attempt at
| commercialism, is a very good ex
j ample of the modern trend that has
been sweeping the country. Just
j behind Woody Herman, just ahead
| of Les Brown, this highly progres
sive band, with its tremendous brass
section anchored with a bass trom
bone, is gaining more popularity
with each successive stand.
The rhythm section, composed of
Ed Safranski on bass, Bub Ahern on
guitar, Ralph Collier on drums, and
Stan on piano, backs such soloists
as Vido Musso on tenor, Ray Whet
sel on trumpet, and Boots Mussillo
on alto with tremendous drive.
The\scoring for the brass often
gives one the impression that the
musicians are just trying their best
to make noise, but on closer inspec
tion one finds that a superlative ef
fect is desired and achieved. Stan,
with the help of Gene Howard,*does
the arrangements and the vocal
chores are very capably handled by
June Cristy, Ray Whetsel, and Mr.
Howard.
If this band continues reaching
i the heights is did here on the Farm,
j and Capitol keeps recording the
Kenton Krew the way it has in the
past, then they surely are the band
! we picks for '46.
This past month has been marked
by many newsworthy items in the
field of popular music. One of these
is the addition to the maestro class
of former TD drummer Buddy Rich.
Rich's venture is aided by the funds
of old-time pal Frank Sinatra to the
tune of $25,000. The band, which is
now engaged in Newark, has been
making a quite frantic attempt to
produce some good music.
On the air shows which we have
caught, the balancing of the mikes
has been atrocious and the over
powering effect of Buddy's tuba is
too much for even his most avid
fans. There are no soloists of note
although we would be tempted to
say Rich stole Charlie Shavers from
his old boss by the way his scream
ing trumpet man solos.
Sometimes above average, rarely
exciting, and with too much accen
tuation of the positive, this band has
to be given credit for attempting to
play some music of worth. If Buddy
will profit by Gene Krupa's experi
ence and learn to settle back and
use his skins for what they were
built instead of taking every solo
and break, then this group has a
good chance to make something of

MUSICAL NOTES
Another dispatch from the jazz
front brings us the welcome news
that Red Norvo is joining the thun-

Id( ring herd of Woody Herman. Re
| placing Marjorie Hyams on vibes,
| Red will also front a small group
| taken from the band which jumps
i under the name of Red Norvo and
J 'lis Woodchopptrs.
Rumor has it that Kay Starr will
become the new Harry James vocal
ist replacing Anita Boyer who re
placed Kitty Kit lien. If this is true,
it will prove a great boost to the
sagging James aggregation, as Miss
Starr, formerly with Charlie Bar
net, is one of our better thrushes.
Also featured on one of the Horn's
recent waxings is vocalist Ruth
Haag. In case the name strikes an
unfamiliar note, she is also known
as Legs, Miss Pin-Up, and Mrs. Har
ry James.
Rex Stewart, long-time Ellington
standby, is reported to be leaving
the Duke's organization. The famous
cornet star has gone out on his own
and is leading a small combo in
New York. * * * The music world
was saddened last month by the
death of trombonist Jack Jenney.
Jenney, famous for his work with
Artie Shaw, was considered by many
to have been the greatest sliphorn
artist of them all.
STAN'S STANFORD STAND
Blasting the roof off our basket
ball pavilion last Saturday night
was Stan Kenton and his Artistry in
j Rhythm. Stan the Man, who has
i finally returned to his original style
| of music after a dismal attempt at
| commercialism, is a very good ex
j ample of the modern trend that has
been sweeping the country. Just
j behind Woody Herman, just ahead
| of Les Brown, this highly progres
sive band, with its tremendous brass
section anchored with a bass trom
bone, is gaining more popularity
with each successive stand.
The rhythm section, composed of
Ed Safranski on bass, Bub Ahern on
guitar, Ralph Collier on drums, and
Stan on piano, backs such soloists
as Vido Musso on tenor, Ray Whet
sel on trumpet, and Boots Mussillo
on alto with tremendous drive.
The\scoring for the brass often
gives one the impression that the
musicians are just trying their best
to make noise, but on closer inspec
tion one finds that a superlative ef
fect is desired and achieved. Stan,
with the help of Gene Howard,*does
the arrangements and the vocal
chores are very capably handled by
June Cristy, Ray Whetsel, and Mr.
Howard.
If this band continues reaching
i the heights is did here on the Farm,
j and Capitol keeps recording the
Kenton Krew the way it has in the
past, then they surely are the band
! we picks for '46.
This past month has been marked
by many newsworthy items in the
field of popular music. One of these
is the addition to the maestro class
of former TD drummer Buddy Rich.
Rich's venture is aided by the funds
of old-time pal Frank Sinatra to the
tune of $25,000. The band, which is
now engaged in Newark, has been
making a quite frantic attempt to
produce some good music.
On the air shows which we have
caught, the balancing of the mikes
has been atrocious and the over
powering effect of Buddy's tuba is
too much for even his most avid
fans. There are no soloists of note
although we would be tempted to
say Rich stole Charlie Shavers from
his old boss by the way his scream
ing trumpet man solos.
Sometimes above average, rarely
exciting, and with too much accen
tuation of the positive, this band has
to be given credit for attempting to
play some music of worth. If Buddy
will profit by Gene Krupa's experi
ence and learn to settle back and
use his skins for what they were
built instead of taking every solo
and break, then this group has a
good chance to make something of
itself in
GOO!) ENOUGH TO KEEP
Sunset Recording Company, the
small Los Angeles firm that has been
making so much progress in the field
of jazz has come up with the piano
"man" who we think will drag down
the new-star honors for his instru
ment during the coming year. He is
16-year-old Andre Previn whose
new disc with Dave Barbour and
John Simmons has been causing no
end of comment in the City of th«
Angels.
The tunes which were waxed were
two standards, "Blue Skies" and
"Good Enough to Keep," and al
though the former is the better of
the two, both give young Previn a
chance to demonstrate his fabulous
technique and his fine jazz concep
tion. If Andre doesn't disappear into
a music conservatory in February
when he graduates from high school,
then look for big things from him in
the "kingdom of swing." Dave Bar
bour. former big-band guitarist, now
residing in Los Angeles, takes plenty
of his wonderful single-string solo
stuff, and the depth that John Sim
mon's bass adds to the whole session
makes the record even more en
ioyable.
