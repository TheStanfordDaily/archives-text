# Reopening Fraternities Face Financial Problems
## 
### 
The biggest problem facing the ■
return of fraternities to the Stan- j
ford campus is the financial one.
For 10 years or more every fra
ternity on campus has ended up in
the black. When fraternities were I
discontinued in 1943, all of the chap
ters had some money on hand as a
possible basis for starting up again.
As far as house mortgages go,
some of the chapters have sizable |
debts while others are absolutely
clear. Housing corporations own j
most of ihe houses.
Loans Problem
Whether the University will loan
the fraternities money or whether
the loans will have to come from the
national organizations to put the
houses back in shape, is one of the
difficult problems facing both the
University and the fraternities.
In the past the University has
loaned some houses up to $5,000.
Another source of income to the
fraternities will be the rent collected
from the University during the years
the fraternities were not in opera
tion. This rent will be dealt out
proportionately. There was a clause
in the original rental document that
said the University would be re
sponsible for any damages to the
house beyond the "usual wear and |
tear."
Houses Self-Supporting
The fraternities do not cost the
University a cent for housing. The
fraternities have always taken care
of themselves and expect to do so in
ihe future.
In the past the fraternity man has
paid for rebuilding and all other ex
penses. The average fraternity
man's expenses have usually run
higher than those of a person living
in a University residence. This is
partly because of the expense to the

fraternity of keeping up its own
house independently.
Open .loitly
Fraternities at Stanford do not ex
pect to open until the University
returns all houses. If chapters have
the opportunity to op?n and do not
take advantage of the opportunity
for various reasons, the other houses
will probably go ahead and open.
Of course a majority of the frater
nities have to be on an operating
basis before the houses can possibly
open.
A new interfraternity rule that
has been passed says that all chap
ter advisers must be local. Other
suggestions that the board will have
to consider are the idea of house
fathers or house mothers and more
supervision of academic and social
standards.
The fraternities have expressed
confidence that they will be able to
come back and master the financial
questions that face them. The ques
tions ai'e serious ones—both to the
University and to the chapters—
and will have to be worked out with
close co-ordination between thr ad
ministration, fraternity members,
and alumni.

ford campus is the financial one.
For 10 years or more every fra
ternity on campus has ended up in
the black. When fraternities were I
discontinued in 1943, all of the chap
ters had some money on hand as a
possible basis for starting up again.
As far as house mortgages go,
some of the chapters have sizable |
debts while others are absolutely
clear. Housing corporations own j
most of ihe houses.
Loans Problem
Whether the University will loan
the fraternities money or whether
the loans will have to come from the
national organizations to put the
houses back in shape, is one of the
difficult problems facing both the
University and the fraternities.
In the past the University has
loaned some houses up to $5,000.
Another source of income to the
fraternities will be the rent collected
from the University during the years
the fraternities were not in opera
tion. This rent will be dealt out
proportionately. There was a clause
in the original rental document that
said the University would be re
sponsible for any damages to the
house beyond the "usual wear and |
tear."
Houses Self-Supporting
The fraternities do not cost the
University a cent for housing. The
fraternities have always taken care
of themselves and expect to do so in
ihe future.
In the past the fraternity man has
paid for rebuilding and all other ex
penses. The average fraternity
man's expenses have usually run
higher than those of a person living
in a University residence. This is
partly because of the expense to the

fraternity of keeping up its own
house independently.
Open .loitly
Fraternities at Stanford do not ex
pect to open until the University
returns all houses. If chapters have
the opportunity to op?n and do not
take advantage of the opportunity
for various reasons, the other houses
will probably go ahead and open.
Of course a majority of the frater
nities have to be on an operating
basis before the houses can possibly
open.
A new interfraternity rule that
has been passed says that all chap
ter advisers must be local. Other
suggestions that the board will have
to consider are the idea of house
fathers or house mothers and more
supervision of academic and social
standards.
The fraternities have expressed
confidence that they will be able to
come back and master the financial
questions that face them. The ques
tions ai'e serious ones—both to the
University and to the chapters—
and will have to be worked out with
close co-ordination between thr ad
ministration, fraternity members,
and alumni.
