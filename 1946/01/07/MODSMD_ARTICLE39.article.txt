NEW YORK, Jan. G UP).â€”Col
legiate basketball teams were ready
to settle down to the grind of con
ference play this week, but sectional
leaders generally were established
already,on the basis of comprehen
sive warm-up schedules.
The past week marked the down
iall of one unbeaten contender for
national honors and the rise of an
other. Kentucky's Wildcats, hailed
by many court experts as the best
team in the country, went down be
fore a tricky Temple squad at Phila
delphia, after eight straight wins.
At the same time, Wyoming's Cow
boys made a successful swing
through the East and Midwest and
ran their winning streak to nine
games with three victories. The
Cowboys, 194.J national collegiate
champions, have a nucleus of their
title team back from military serv
ice and are gaining support as pos
sible repeaters.
There still were top flight un
beaten teams in every section of
the country bust the list was dwin
dling. Some major schools have yet
to begin their schedules. Navy's
Midshipmen, considered one of the
potentially powerful eastern teams,
nas won both of the games it has
jlayed and Army hasn't started yet.
The Cadets also are considered very
Dowerful.
