### BOB SLOBE 
The beginning of the New Year also marks the inauguration
of a complete sports program at Stanford. The Indians after a
brief return to the gridiron have entered into PCC competition in
basketball in what you might call low gear, but last weekend's
games at USC seem to say that our cagers are thinking seriously
of shifting into second—high is a long way off.
CARDS DRUBBED
In the Nevada Invitational Tourney the Cardinals were
soundly drubbed by a superior Utah guintet by a decisive score
of 53-15. We scored only two elds all night with the remainder of
the digits coming from free throws. On the second night of play,
Nevada, who had lost to Cal the preceding evening also topped
the game, but outclassed Cards.
- Then it seems that Coach Everett Dean went to work, for the
team did not do badly in last week's games against the Tro
jans—that is "Highly Favored" Trojans. On Friday, January 4,
the men from down south—south, that is—completely dominated
the floor play to win 62-49 with Stanford's only consolation being
that forward Jim Hill led the whole conference in scoring when
he tossed in six field goals and five foul shots for 17 points. Sat
urday night, Troy overcame an early 7-4 lead to cop the second
game of the series, by a score of 43-32. t
BEARS NEXT
Next week Stanford meets the mighty Bears from Berkeley,
who have just succeeded in downing UCLA twice in their open
ing series. Judging by comparative scores, the Indians haven't
got a chance to beat Cal, who boasts of Andy Wolfe, the fourth
highest scorer in national basketball circles. Some of the Cal stal
warts, interested in perpetuating school spirit, took the liberty
of wishing their rivals down on the Farm a Happy New Year by
painting same all over the Boathouse. They obviously didn't read
the sign that says, "Boathouse For Exclusive Use of Stanford
Students".
The Bears will find that Stanford is no pushover, for the new
guarter has already brought some promising new faces into the
Indian lineup, the most notable being (?) Murphy—first name not
available—who scored four points in a brief appearance against
USC. Recently discharged from the service, Murphy is about 6'
5" and has had plenty of experience. We saw him play his first
game in two years a few Saturday's ago, when he was performing
with the Palo Alto Elks, and he looked like he might be a future
headache for some aspirant to the conference championship.
CAL WILL TOP PCC
Looking over pre-season records, I would say that the con
ference will wind up with California, USC, and USCL9 in the first
three spots with Stanford gracing the cellar. I could be wrong—l
hope I am.
In the Northern Division of the PCC, Washington State has a
top-notch team that will be hard to beat. As for the Nationals, I
would say that it would be wise to keep your eye on the "Fight
ing Irish" of Notre Dame, who toppled mighty De Paul Saturday
night 43-42.

USC. Recently discharged from the service, Murphy is about 6'
5" and has had plenty of experience. We saw him play his first
game in two years a few Saturday's ago, when he was performing
with the Palo Alto Elks, and he looked like he might be a future
headache for some aspirant to the conference championship.
CAL WILL TOP PCC
Looking over pre-season records, I would say that the con
ference will wind up with California, USC, and USCL9 in the first
three spots with Stanford gracing the cellar. I could be wrong—l
hope I am.
In the Northern Division of the PCC, Washington State has a
top-notch team that will be hard to beat. As for the Nationals, I
would say that it would be wise to keep your eye on the "Fight
ing Irish" of Notre Dame, who toppled mighty De Paul Saturday
night 43-42.
The beginning of the New Year also marks the inauguration
of a complete sports program at Stanford. The Indians after a
brief return to the gridiron have entered into PCC competition in
basketball in what you might call low gear, but last weekend's
games at USC seem to say that our cagers are thinking seriously
of shifting into second—high is a long way off.
CARDS DRUBBED
In the Nevada Invitational Tourney the Cardinals were
soundly drubbed by a superior Utah guintet by a decisive score
of 53-15. We scored only two elds all night with the remainder of
the digits coming from free throws. On the second night of play,
Nevada, who had lost to Cal the preceding evening also topped
the game, but outclassed Cards.
- Then it seems that Coach Everett Dean went to work, for the
team did not do badly in last week's games against the Tro
jans—that is "Highly Favored" Trojans. On Friday, January 4,
the men from down south—south, that is—completely dominated
the floor play to win 62-49 with Stanford's only consolation being
that forward Jim Hill led the whole conference in scoring when
he tossed in six field goals and five foul shots for 17 points. Sat
urday night, Troy overcame an early 7-4 lead to cop the second
game of the series, by a score of 43-32. t
BEARS NEXT
Next week Stanford meets the mighty Bears from Berkeley,
who have just succeeded in downing UCLA twice in their open
ing series. Judging by comparative scores, the Indians haven't
got a chance to beat Cal, who boasts of Andy Wolfe, the fourth
highest scorer in national basketball circles. Some of the Cal stal
warts, interested in perpetuating school spirit, took the liberty
of wishing their rivals down on the Farm a Happy New Year by
painting same all over the Boathouse. They obviously didn't read
the sign that says, "Boathouse For Exclusive Use of Stanford
Students".
The Bears will find that Stanford is no pushover, for the new
guarter has already brought some promising new faces into the
Indian lineup, the most notable being (?) Murphy—first name not
available—who scored four points in a brief appearance against
USC. Recently discharged from the service, Murphy is about 6'
5" and has had plenty of experience. We saw him play his first
game in two years a few Saturday's ago, when he was performing
with the Palo Alto Elks, and he looked like he might be a future
