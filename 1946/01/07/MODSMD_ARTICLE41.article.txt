# Farm Basketballers Aim For More Improvement
## 
### STU MILLAR 
â–  S.C. won and handily, but Coach
Everett Dean's basketball team dis
played vast improvement over early
season practice contests.
Stanford's cagers suffered blow
after blow not only from opposing
teams but from injuries and ineligi
bility. Rodman, who will be out at
least another week, Christiansen,
Chillson, and O'Brfen, all first-string
men, have been out of action at one
time or another during the last few
weeks. A new man, Murphy, en
tered ihe starting line-up with the
benefit of two practices. The ineli
gibility of Paul Chilson and the re
fused admittance to another ball
player whom the team was counting
on heavily only heaped more woes
on the back of Coach Dean.
But several Stanford players
turned in more than creditable per
formances. Jim Hill shot and
guarded brilliantly in the first con
test and continued his fine work in
the second contest. He definitely
fits with Coach Dean's future plans
because of his work this week-end.
Gene Martin, who was playing out
of position in the patched-up Stan
ford line-up, found his stride and
was excellent, particularly in the
second game. He scored 20 points
in the series, second to Hill's 26
markers.
Bill O'Brien and Max King, In
dian centers, divided playing time

equally, but they had to devote most
of the time to stopping the all-coast
center Nichols, whose dead eye and
backboard strength was probably
the biggest difference between the
two teams. Other players to see ac
tion were Tom Hood, Ed Lefcourt
and Pat Taylor, who relieved Chris
tiansen for most of the second game.
Chris, former Stanford frosh
hoopman before entering the serv
ice, has been plagued by injuries in
every game this year. His four dif
ferent injuries have made him yearn
for his combat missions over Ger
many in which he came through
unscathed. He performed brilliantly
in the first S.C. game but was in
jured in the opening seconds of the
second. He will be out for some
lime.
About the S.C. series, Coach Ev
erett Dean said, "I was proud of the
boys in the second game because
they outfought the Trojans in their
own little cracker-box gym and
forced them to play 39 of the 40
minutes without a substitution. And
then they won only by sensational
shooting."
"But we believe that we will win
a fair percentage of the remaining
games," he concluded.
