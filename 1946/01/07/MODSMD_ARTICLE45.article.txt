tating while the rest of the cast
hollers unmercifully at her. It's a
question of everybody wanting to
get into the act, with Lauren not
knowing how to get in.
That great continental lover,
Charles Boyer, is cast opposite Miss
Dncall as a frustrated Spaniard out
to get some Fascists who have evi
dently killed his wife, burned his

home, et al. Charlie, however, talks
more like a Greek than a Spaniard
which proved to be a little discon-

The companion feature on the
Stanford bill is a Republic produc-1
lion bearing the non-committal title,
"Love, Honor, and Goodbye." Shows
are continuous all day so you can

And now a plug for a forthcoming
picture, "The Lost Weekend," which
you probably know already is a
study in dipsomania. It opens Thurs
day at the Fox Theatre in San
Francisco and is guaranteed to cure
you of that uncontrollable craving
; for your favorite alcoholic bever
age. Or so the press notices say.
If anybody has read this far in

I hat the review department could

j sober reviewers. The only qualifica

tempt for 90 per cent of the Holly
wood output. If you'd like to try
i your luck, stumble on over to the
Daily Shack.—Dick Bower.
