# American UNO Delegates Split On Atom Bomb Control Policy
## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. Ii (UP). —The
American delegation to the United
Nations Congress is split as to
whether to support the Moscow
resolution on atomic energy, au
thoritative informants said tonight.
Opponents may force revision
of the resolution to further safe
guard the secret of the atom bomb,
according to these sources. They
also seek stronger guarantees of
reciprocity in exchange for scien
tific information.
So strong is the opposition, infor
mants said, that congressional ap
proval of the resolution would be
jeopardized unless objections were
met.
The whole question is to be ironed
out when Secretary of State James
F. Byrnes arrives for the World As
sembly starting Thursday.
Opposition was calculated to
cause some embarrassment to the
United States government. As
chief delegate to the Conference of
Foreign Ministers to Moscow,
Byrnes took part in approval of
the resolution. Hence, he has
committed the government to sup
port it. Rut he faces the possibil
ity that his own delegates to Lon
don will compel him to seek
amendments to it.
It was recalled that Sen. Arthur H.
Vandenberg, R., Mich., one of the
delegates, was exceedingly critical of
the Moscow atomic energy resolu
tion immediately, upon its publica
tion.
Other delegates are Edward R.
Stettinius, Jr., chief delegate; Sen.
Torn Connally, D., Tex., and Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt.
After a talk with President Tru
man, Vanclenberg said he was satis
fied with informal assurances the
President gave him that no Ameri
can atomic energy secrets would be
disclosed until a system of inspec
tion and control was made effective.
Major criticism of the resolution
was aimed at alleged vagueness of
phrasing. The written objections

now before the delegation say that
the present phrasing might permit
the disclosure of vital atomic se
crets without adequate inspection
or control and could he used to
make the United States automati
cally transfer to the United Na
tions all authority to deal with
atomic energy.
Opponents were said to be seek- I
ing to get an interpretation of the j
resolution by President Truman at- I
tached to the resolution as a safe- j
| guard.
The written statement says that j
(he resolution is unlikely to win
congressional approval and that the
result might be long delay in inter
nationalizing the atomic problme.
United Nations success, the state
ment says, depends on clear under- I
standings and would be endangered ;
by vague undertakings.

LONDON, Jan. Ii (UP). —The
American delegation to the United
Nations Congress is split as to
whether to support the Moscow
resolution on atomic energy, au
thoritative informants said tonight.
Opponents may force revision
of the resolution to further safe
guard the secret of the atom bomb,
according to these sources. They
also seek stronger guarantees of
reciprocity in exchange for scien
tific information.
So strong is the opposition, infor
mants said, that congressional ap
proval of the resolution would be
jeopardized unless objections were
met.
The whole question is to be ironed
out when Secretary of State James
F. Byrnes arrives for the World As
sembly starting Thursday.
Opposition was calculated to
cause some embarrassment to the
United States government. As
chief delegate to the Conference of
Foreign Ministers to Moscow,
Byrnes took part in approval of
the resolution. Hence, he has
committed the government to sup
port it. Rut he faces the possibil
ity that his own delegates to Lon
don will compel him to seek
amendments to it.
It was recalled that Sen. Arthur H.
Vandenberg, R., Mich., one of the
delegates, was exceedingly critical of
the Moscow atomic energy resolu
tion immediately, upon its publica
tion.
Other delegates are Edward R.
Stettinius, Jr., chief delegate; Sen.
Torn Connally, D., Tex., and Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt.
After a talk with President Tru
man, Vanclenberg said he was satis
fied with informal assurances the
President gave him that no Ameri
can atomic energy secrets would be
disclosed until a system of inspec
tion and control was made effective.
Major criticism of the resolution
was aimed at alleged vagueness of
phrasing. The written objections

now before the delegation say that
the present phrasing might permit
the disclosure of vital atomic se
crets without adequate inspection
or control and could he used to
make the United States automati
cally transfer to the United Na
tions all authority to deal with
atomic energy.
