## 
### 
Stanford debaters will work in
four main fields this quarter, ac
cording to the tentative plans of Le
land T. Chapin, debate coach.
Looking forward to a busy win
ter, Debate Society members will
meet at 4 p.m. tomorrow in room
200T of the History Building to out
line their progratn.
Mr. Chapin invites all old mem
bers of Debate Society who have
returned to campus, as well as all
others who like to talk, to attend â– 
tomorrow's meeting.
Program Outlined
The quarter's schedule will in
clude discussions of the problem
solving type before service clubs,
training for the JofTre Debate, prep
aration for a number of tourneys to
be held early spring quarter, and in
tercollegiate contests throughout the
winter.
Problem-solving debates will be
stressed because of (he great de
mand from service clubs for this
kind of discussion.
JofTre Training
Three society members, who have
not been selected, will start training
for the 52nd JofTre Debate. This
contest is held annually between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia on a question of French for
eign policy. Cal has a narrow 26-25
lead at present, after breaking the
tie last year.
Preparation for coast contests is
important on the agenda of society
members. Stanford intends to par
ticipate in the three tourneys that
are scheduled for April. The An
nual Meeting of the Pacific Fo
rensic League in Stockton, April
1-.'}, will be highlighted by ex
temporaneous speaking and ora
tory contests, as well as discussion
forums.
It will be followed by the College
of the Pacific Tournament on April
4, 5 and 6.
Western Tourney
The contests will be climaxed by
the Western Association tournament
scheduled to be held in Los Angeles
around April 20.
Arrangements for intercollegiate
debates during the winter are in
the hands of Pat Ulair, debate
manager. The first concrete news
along this line states that while
U.C. refuses to engage in decision
debating they have invited Stan
ford for a non-decision meeting
on the problems of the atomic
bomb.
Mr. Chapin summed up the plans
for the quarter by saying that "true
to Stanford debate tradition we are
interested in developing problem
solving discussions as well as foren
sic debating, depending on the needs
and desires of the individual stu
dent."
