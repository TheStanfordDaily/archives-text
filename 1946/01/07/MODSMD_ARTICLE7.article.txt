# REGISTRATION SETS RECORD
## Off-Campus Housing Problem Acute 
### 
With the rise of Stanford's registration to an expected 4,200 by 5 p.m.
today, approximately 1,500 students will of necessity be living in off-cam
pus residences during winter quarter.
Despite the fact that a number of the:;e are med students in San Fran
cisco or students living at home, that some have housing secured in past

quarters, and others have been for
tunate enough to find newly uncov
ered living-space, a sizeable chunk
of the 1.500, most of them married,
are figuratively if not literally "out
in the cold."
"It's a mystcrv to me where they
are all living.'" said Dean of Stu
dents John Stalnaker in a state
ment to the Palo Alto Times Fri
day. "They must have made pro
visions ahead of registration day."
He said, however, that he had
heard few complaints on rcg day.
"Even if we had housing for from
200 to 300 married students," he con
tinued, "we would have three or
four applications for each unit."
All single undergraduate students
who were accepted to the University
this quarter and who applied for
housing have been accommodated in
campus living-groups, according to
Gene Gear, assistant to the Director
of Information.
"Apparently hundreds of students
are going to take their chances for
one quarter and see what can be
worked out," he said. Many of the
married students have taken bache
lor accommodations on the campus
in hopes of finding homes for their
families during the quarter.
Possibilities of accommodations
for graduate and married students
at Candlestick Cove and Hunter's
Point near San Francisco were in
vestigated by Stanford with the
plan of operating bus transporta
tion to and from the Quad for
students thus housed.
Although no large amount of
housing has been found available
in these war worker projects, mar
ried students are being referred in
dividually to Candlestick Cove and
in some instances are securing ac
commodations there.
Letters were sent from the oflicc
of A.S.S.U. President Bob Ken
nedy to civic clubs of Palo Alto
urging that the Dean of Students'
office be informed 24 hours in ad
vance of notification to other pos
sible customers, of any available
housing in the community. The
Palo Alto Times joined in the plea
for student housing with an edi
torial and illustrative articles.
Adams, Taylor, and Roosevelt
Halls have been added to the list of
men's dormitories. Adams, housing
13 men, is the former A.K.L. house;
Roosevelt ,accommodating 36, the
former Zeta Psi house, and Taylor,
with 27 men, was the K.A. house.
According to Dean Stanley
Sharp, director of men's residence,
the capacity in men's housing, as
it existed before the war. has been
reached, with the University now
operating 22 of the 24 fraternities
as men's residences, and women
occupying the other two.
Juniper Lodge, which was
"shrunk" last quarter (the under
graduate women living there moved
into other residences), is now oc
cupied by 32 graduate women.
Encina Hall is now occupied en
tirely by civilian men, 529 of them,
who are taking over the rooms oc
cupied until this quarter by students
in the Army Specialized Training
Program. Dormitory accotnmoda-

Stanford's rcgistraton totals took another upswing Friday, bringing
overall totals for Thursday and Friday to 3,928, an increase of 1,455 over
second-day registration totals for winter quarter 11)45.
Figures of Saturday's registration were not available, but it was be
lieved by Dean of Students John M. Stalnaker that the total of registered

students would reach the 4,200 fig
ure by 5 p.m. today. This would
mean an all-time high in peace
time reg totals.
Reg figures broken down show
that 2,437 men had registered by
Friday, with 1.491 women and 1 (>C)
N.R.O.T.C.'s helping to fill the Ad
Building on Thursday and Friday.
Last year showed 854 civilian men
to 1619 women registered by the sec
ond day of winter quarter.
Thursday's total was 3,752, with
2,.'534 of these men, a sharp rise over
last year's first-day total of 827 men.
In spite of the large number regis
tering for v/inter quarter, Reg Day
went smoothly, according to Dean
Stalnaker, who gave main credit for
easier reging to the fact that facili
ties for paying tuition were removed
from the Ad Building, thereby les
sening crowds and lines.
He pointed out that by 3:30 Thurs
day afternoon there were no lines in
the Ad Building, and, due to a new
makeup of Reg books, there was not
the customary litter of discarded
Reg books on the Ad Building floor.
Only bottleneck for incoming stu
dents was the veterans' registration
procedure which had been adapted
to serve a much smaller number of
veterans than were present. Mr.
Stalnaker reported that 1,260 vet
erans had registered by Saturday,
many more than were expected, be
said.
Reason for this, he said, was thai
there is no method of determining
the number of returning Stanford
students, veterans, who need only
appear on Reg Day to re-enter the
school.
Advisory procedures were revised
to take care of the many returning
servicemen, however, and by Sat
urday most vet registration head
aches were gone, Mr. Stalnaker said.

Stanford's rcgistraton totals took another upswing Friday, bringing
overall totals for Thursday and Friday to 3,928, an increase of 1,455 over
second-day registration totals for winter quarter 11)45.
Figures of Saturday's registration were not available, but it was be
lieved by Dean of Students John M. Stalnaker that the total of registered

students would reach the 4,200 fig
ure by 5 p.m. today. This would
mean an all-time high in peace
time reg totals.
Reg figures broken down show
that 2,437 men had registered by
Friday, with 1.491 women and 1 (>C)
N.R.O.T.C.'s helping to fill the Ad
Building on Thursday and Friday.
Last year showed 854 civilian men
to 1619 women registered by the sec
ond day of winter quarter.
Thursday's total was 3,752, with
2,.'534 of these men, a sharp rise over
last year's first-day total of 827 men.
In spite of the large number regis
tering for v/inter quarter, Reg Day
went smoothly, according to Dean
Stalnaker, who gave main credit for
easier reging to the fact that facili
ties for paying tuition were removed
from the Ad Building, thereby les
sening crowds and lines.
He pointed out that by 3:30 Thurs
day afternoon there were no lines in
the Ad Building, and, due to a new
makeup of Reg books, there was not
the customary litter of discarded
Reg books on the Ad Building floor.
Only bottleneck for incoming stu
dents was the veterans' registration
procedure which had been adapted
to serve a much smaller number of
veterans than were present. Mr.
Stalnaker reported that 1,260 vet
erans had registered by Saturday,
many more than were expected, be
said.
Reason for this, he said, was thai
there is no method of determining
the number of returning Stanford
students, veterans, who need only
appear on Reg Day to re-enter the
school.
Advisory procedures were revised
to take care of the many returning
servicemen, however, and by Sat
urday most vet registration head
aches were gone, Mr. Stalnaker said.

Congress' recent appropriation of
$192,000,000 for schools and commu

for veterans and their families ap

ever, the significance of this pro
gram for Stanford is not yet known.
Eldridge T. Spcnccr, director of
planning, is proceeding with plans
for additional permanent housing
for both graduate and undergrad
uate students, which it is hoped
will be opened in the fall. These
facilities were authorized hy the
Board of Trustees at a recent
meeting.
For ..many months Stanford has
been in touch with the Federal
Housing Authority in San Francisco
and has been working closely with
the Army's Ninth Service Command
and the Twelfth Naval District,
checking on all types of surplus
housing on the entire Pacific Coast
Because no mint of housing has
been uncovered, it has been the
University policy to discourage mar
ried students who are seeking hous
ing from registering.
The use of government trailers
and Quonset huts has been studied
and found to be too expensive to
purchase and install considering
their necessary temporariness.
With the rise of Stanford's registration to an expected 4,200 by 5 p.m.
today, approximately 1,500 students will of necessity be living in off-cam
pus residences during winter quarter.
Despite the fact that a number of the:;e are med students in San Fran
cisco or students living at home, that some have housing secured in past

quarters, and others have been for
tunate enough to find newly uncov
ered living-space, a sizeable chunk
of the 1.500, most of them married,
are figuratively if not literally "out
in the cold."
"It's a mystcrv to me where they
are all living.'" said Dean of Stu
dents John Stalnaker in a state
ment to the Palo Alto Times Fri
day. "They must have made pro
visions ahead of registration day."
He said, however, that he had
heard few complaints on rcg day.
"Even if we had housing for from
200 to 300 married students," he con
tinued, "we would have three or
four applications for each unit."
All single undergraduate students
who were accepted to the University
this quarter and who applied for
housing have been accommodated in
campus living-groups, according to
Gene Gear, assistant to the Director
of Information.
"Apparently hundreds of students
are going to take their chances for
one quarter and see what can be
worked out," he said. Many of the
married students have taken bache
lor accommodations on the campus
in hopes of finding homes for their
families during the quarter.
Possibilities of accommodations
for graduate and married students
at Candlestick Cove and Hunter's
Point near San Francisco were in
vestigated by Stanford with the
plan of operating bus transporta
tion to and from the Quad for
students thus housed.
Although no large amount of
housing has been found available
in these war worker projects, mar
ried students are being referred in
dividually to Candlestick Cove and
in some instances are securing ac
commodations there.

Eldridge T. Spcnccr, director of

for additional permanent housing
for both graduate and undergrad

will be opened in the fall. These
facilities were authorized hy the
Board of Trustees at a recent
meeting.
For ..many months Stanford has
been in touch with the Federal
Housing Authority in San Francisco
and has been working closely with
the Army's Ninth Service Command
and the Twelfth Naval District,
checking on all types of surplus
housing on the entire Pacific Coast
Because no mint of housing has
been uncovered, it has been the
University policy to discourage mar
ried students who are seeking hous
ing from registering.
The use of government trailers
and Quonset huts has been studied
and found to be too expensive to
purchase and install considering
their necessary temporariness.
With the rise of Stanford's registration to an expected 4,200 by 5 p.m.
today, approximately 1,500 students will of necessity be living in off-cam
pus residences during winter quarter.
Despite the fact that a number of the:;e are med students in San Fran
cisco or students living at home, that some have housing secured in past

quarters, and others have been for
tunate enough to find newly uncov
ered living-space, a sizeable chunk
of the 1.500, most of them married,
are figuratively if not literally "out
in the cold."
"It's a mystcrv to me where they
are all living.'" said Dean of Stu
dents John Stalnaker in a state
ment to the Palo Alto Times Fri
day. "They must have made pro
visions ahead of registration day."
He said, however, that he had
heard few complaints on rcg day.
"Even if we had housing for from
200 to 300 married students," he con
tinued, "we would have three or
four applications for each unit."
All single undergraduate students
who were accepted to the University
this quarter and who applied for
housing have been accommodated in
campus living-groups, according to
Gene Gear, assistant to the Director
of Information.
"Apparently hundreds of students
are going to take their chances for
one quarter and see what can be
worked out," he said. Many of the
married students have taken bache
lor accommodations on the campus
in hopes of finding homes for their
families during the quarter.
Possibilities of accommodations
for graduate and married students
at Candlestick Cove and Hunter's
Point near San Francisco were in
vestigated by Stanford with the
plan of operating bus transporta
tion to and from the Quad for
students thus housed.
Although no large amount of
housing has been found available
in these war worker projects, mar
ried students are being referred in
dividually to Candlestick Cove and
in some instances are securing ac
commodations there.
Letters were sent from the oflicc

housing in the community. The
Palo Alto Times joined in the plea
for student housing with an edi

13 men, is the former A.K.L. house;
Roosevelt ,accommodating 36, the

with 27 men, was the K.A. house.
According to Dean Stanley
Sharp, director of men's residence,
the capacity in men's housing, as
it existed before the war. has been
reached, with the University now
operating 22 of the 24 fraternities
as men's residences, and women
occupying the other two.

Stanford's rcgistraton totals took another upswing Friday, bringing
overall totals for Thursday and Friday to 3,928, an increase of 1,455 over
second-day registration totals for winter quarter 11)45.
Figures of Saturday's registration were not available, but it was be
lieved by Dean of Students John M. Stalnaker that the total of registered

students would reach the 4,200 fig
ure by 5 p.m. today. This would
mean an all-time high in peace
time reg totals.
Reg figures broken down show
that 2,437 men had registered by
Friday, with 1.491 women and 1 (>C)
N.R.O.T.C.'s helping to fill the Ad
Building on Thursday and Friday.
Last year showed 854 civilian men
to 1619 women registered by the sec
ond day of winter quarter.
Thursday's total was 3,752, with
2,.'534 of these men, a sharp rise over
last year's first-day total of 827 men.
In spite of the large number regis
tering for v/inter quarter, Reg Day
went smoothly, according to Dean
Stalnaker, who gave main credit for
easier reging to the fact that facili
ties for paying tuition were removed
from the Ad Building, thereby les
sening crowds and lines.
He pointed out that by 3:30 Thurs
day afternoon there were no lines in
the Ad Building, and, due to a new
makeup of Reg books, there was not
the customary litter of discarded
Reg books on the Ad Building floor.
Only bottleneck for incoming stu
dents was the veterans' registration
procedure which had been adapted
to serve a much smaller number of
veterans than were present. Mr.
Stalnaker reported that 1,260 vet
erans had registered by Saturday,
many more than were expected, be
said.
Reason for this, he said, was thai
there is no method of determining
the number of returning Stanford
students, veterans, who need only
appear on Reg Day to re-enter the
school.
Advisory procedures were revised
to take care of the many returning
servicemen, however, and by Sat
urday most vet registration head
aches were gone, Mr. Stalnaker said.

Stanford's rcgistraton totals took another upswing Friday, bringing
overall totals for Thursday and Friday to 3,928, an increase of 1,455 over
second-day registration totals for winter quarter 11)45.
Figures of Saturday's registration were not available, but it was be
lieved by Dean of Students John M. Stalnaker that the total of registered

students would reach the 4,200 fig
ure by 5 p.m. today. This would
mean an all-time high in peace
time reg totals.
Reg figures broken down show
that 2,437 men had registered by
Friday, with 1.491 women and 1 (>C)
N.R.O.T.C.'s helping to fill the Ad
Building on Thursday and Friday.
Last year showed 854 civilian men
to 1619 women registered by the sec
ond day of winter quarter.
Thursday's total was 3,752, with
2,.'534 of these men, a sharp rise over
last year's first-day total of 827 men.
In spite of the large number regis
tering for v/inter quarter, Reg Day
went smoothly, according to Dean
Stalnaker, who gave main credit for
easier reging to the fact that facili
ties for paying tuition were removed
from the Ad Building, thereby les
sening crowds and lines.
He pointed out that by 3:30 Thurs
day afternoon there were no lines in
the Ad Building, and, due to a new
makeup of Reg books, there was not
the customary litter of discarded
Reg books on the Ad Building floor.
Only bottleneck for incoming stu
dents was the veterans' registration
procedure which had been adapted
to serve a much smaller number of
veterans than were present. Mr.
Stalnaker reported that 1,260 vet
erans had registered by Saturday,
many more than were expected, be
said.
Reason for this, he said, was thai
there is no method of determining
the number of returning Stanford
students, veterans, who need only
appear on Reg Day to re-enter the
school.
Advisory procedures were revised
to take care of the many returning
servicemen, however, and by Sat
urday most vet registration head
aches were gone, Mr. Stalnaker said.


808 KENNEDY, A.S.S.U. president for '45-'IG, officially welcomes
new students and veterans returning to the Farm who registered for
winter quarter.
tions arc filled for 1,280 women, 1,225
civilian men and 180 members of
the Naval Reserve Officers' Train
ing Corps.
Congress' recent appropriation of
$192,000,000 for schools and commu
nities to provide temporary housing
for veterans and their families ap
peared as a ray of hope to Stan
ford's residence committees. How
ever, the significance of this pro
gram for Stanford is not yet known.
Eldridge T. Spcnccr, director of
planning, is proceeding with plans
for additional permanent housing
for both graduate and undergrad
uate students, which it is hoped
will be opened in the fall. These
facilities were authorized hy the
Board of Trustees at a recent
meeting.
For ..many months Stanford has
been in touch with the Federal
Housing Authority in San Francisco
and has been working closely with
the Army's Ninth Service Command
and the Twelfth Naval District,
checking on all types of surplus
housing on the entire Pacific Coast
Because no mint of housing has
been uncovered, it has been the
University policy to discourage mar
ried students who are seeking hous
ing from registering.
The use of government trailers
and Quonset huts has been studied
and found to be too expensive to
purchase and install considering
their necessary temporariness.

With the rise of Stanford's registration to an expected 4,200 by 5 p.m.
today, approximately 1,500 students will of necessity be living in off-cam
pus residences during winter quarter.
Despite the fact that a number of the:;e are med students in San Fran
cisco or students living at home, that some have housing secured in past

quarters, and others have been for
tunate enough to find newly uncov
ered living-space, a sizeable chunk
of the 1.500, most of them married,
are figuratively if not literally "out
in the cold."
"It's a mystcrv to me where they
are all living.'" said Dean of Stu
dents John Stalnaker in a state
ment to the Palo Alto Times Fri
day. "They must have made pro
visions ahead of registration day."
He said, however, that he had
heard few complaints on rcg day.
"Even if we had housing for from
200 to 300 married students," he con
tinued, "we would have three or
four applications for each unit."
All single undergraduate students
who were accepted to the University
this quarter and who applied for
housing have been accommodated in
campus living-groups, according to
Gene Gear, assistant to the Director
of Information.
"Apparently hundreds of students
are going to take their chances for
one quarter and see what can be
worked out," he said. Many of the
married students have taken bache
lor accommodations on the campus
in hopes of finding homes for their
families during the quarter.
Possibilities of accommodations
for graduate and married students
at Candlestick Cove and Hunter's
Point near San Francisco were in
vestigated by Stanford with the
plan of operating bus transporta
tion to and from the Quad for
students thus housed.
Although no large amount of
housing has been found available
in these war worker projects, mar
ried students are being referred in
dividually to Candlestick Cove and
in some instances are securing ac
commodations there.
Letters were sent from the oflicc
of A.S.S.U. President Bob Ken
nedy to civic clubs of Palo Alto
urging that the Dean of Students'
office be informed 24 hours in ad
vance of notification to other pos
sible customers, of any available
housing in the community. The
Palo Alto Times joined in the plea
for student housing with an edi
torial and illustrative articles.
Adams, Taylor, and Roosevelt
Halls have been added to the list of
men's dormitories. Adams, housing
13 men, is the former A.K.L. house;
Roosevelt ,accommodating 36, the
former Zeta Psi house, and Taylor,
with 27 men, was the K.A. house.
According to Dean Stanley
Sharp, director of men's residence,
the capacity in men's housing, as
it existed before the war. has been
reached, with the University now
operating 22 of the 24 fraternities
as men's residences, and women
occupying the other two.
Juniper Lodge, which was
"shrunk" last quarter (the under
graduate women living there moved
into other residences), is now oc
