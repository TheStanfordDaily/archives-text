I lie meeting
Begun in lil l.'!
The A.V.C. was started in 1943 by
an AAF corporal when he and a
'(roup of friends began to exchange
ideas on how veterans themselves
can work for peace and help pro
vide the jobs, homes and freedom
for which they fought. Membership
is limited to veterans and service
men and women of World War 11,
Burdick said, but otherwise there
arc no restrictions on membership.
A.V.C. has grown rapidly since its
inauguration, and now has some
i 3,000 members in California alone.
It was the only veterans' group of
World War II to be invited to the
United Nations Conference in San
! Francisco last spring. Three of its
! proposals to liberalize the G.I. Bill
j of Flights have already been passed
j by Congress.
A.V.C. Aims Told
National president of the organi
: zation is Charles Boltc, who wrote
an article for a recent issue of Life
magazine explaining the organiza
tion and its purposes. According to
Burdick, the aims of A.V.C. are
mainly to act as a powerful, liberal
working force for democracy, pros
perity, and security in America.
Burdick was graduated from
Stanford in 1941; and, following
three and a half years of service
with the Navy, has returned to do
graduate work here. Any service
men or veterans wishing to contact
him concerning A.V.C. may reach
him by phoning P.A. 6541.
Palo Alto's Community Center is
at 1305 Middleficld Road, and served
as headquarters, during the war, of
the Palo Alto Red Cross. The Palo
Alto-Stanford bus stops at the cor
ner opposite the Center.
