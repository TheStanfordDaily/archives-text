# U.S. Faces Labor Crisis
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP).â€”
Government labor sources said to
night that the nation faces its most
critical industrial crisis in the next
six days and speculated seriously
that the steel industry would offer
a $l-a-day wage increase, at least,
to avert the strike called for next
Monday.
The steel dispute overshadowed
Labor Department consideration
of further steps to avert a nation
wide telephone strike and new
conferences by high economic and
labor officials to work out a form
ula to prevent the meat packing
workers' walkout set for Jan. Hi.
Officials said they based their ex
pectation of a steel wage offer on
several things:
1. The industry cannot let a strike
occur without making a counter
offer to the union's demand for a
$2 a day wage increase, even though
the offer is conditioned on Office of
Price Administration approval.
2. The offer must be so good that
the union cannot turn it down
easily.
General Electric Corp. has al
ready offered an estimated 8X cents
a day pay hike and General Mo
tors Corp. a $1.08 increase to CIO
unions. lioth offers were rejected.
A $1 offer by steel would he about
in the same relation as present
wage scales in the three indus
tries, it was said.
4. The Oil Workers (CIO) set
tled their 30 per cent wage demand
for 18 per cent with approval of
top CIO leaders. This 18 per cent is
about the equivalent of $1.20 a day
for the steelworkcrs. An offer of $1
a day would be close to what the
steelworkcrs could accept, officials
said.
5. Official quarters believe the
steel industry and union were ar
ranging collective bargaining ses
sions for later this week at which
time a counter offer to the union
would he presented.
Another conference on a possible
wage price formula to avert the
meat strike was held by Reconver
sion Director John W. Snyder. Sta
bilization Administrator John C.
Collett, Secretary of Labor Lewis B.
Schwellenbach, Price Administrator
Chester Bowles and Secretary of
Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson.
