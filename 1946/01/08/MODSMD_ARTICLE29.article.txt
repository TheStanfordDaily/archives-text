Judging from the composition on the mass of
humanity around the Ad Builcimg on Reg Day,
and also by the inevitable breakdown in regis
tration figures, "the Stanford Rough is here to
stay' which brings up an interesting point. If
the Daily during the past few years has been
overbalanced in its emphasis on the feminine
side of the Stanford life; if editorials have ap
pearc i to be more heavily weighted toward
such matters as the women's housing problem,
or women's Row Excom, that's because a war
time staff composed predominantly of women
has found it difficult to maintain adeguate infor
mation on all men's events. Frojn now on, how
ever, we hope the situation will improve as re
turning Daily staff members drop in to look over
the old Shack and stay to help once more in the
production of "The Peninsula's Only Morning
Newspaper."
