TOKYO, J;in. 7 (UP).—Premier Baron Ki.juro Shidehara may seek a
personal interview with Gen. Douglas MaeArthur on suggestions on how to
carry out political purge directives because his cabinet has split on its im
mediate future course, sources closc to the cabinet said today.
Allied officials feel that it is up to the Japanese themselves to settle

► the problem of compliance and to
j change or dispose of their cabinet.
MaeArthur has given the cabinet
no suggestions, and Allied quar
ters said that up to now the Japa
nese have not tried to discuss the
subject with MaeArthur.
Shidehara's cabinet talked over
j the directives yesterday and then
J sent a messenger to Shidehara's
| bedside to tell him what went on.
i The 73-year-old premier, criticized
] by the Japanese press and public
; for the cabinet's inaction, is ill with
j a heart ailment.
Japanese sources said the cabinet
j was divided three ways.
One group believed that Shide-
I hara should dismiss members who
| are disqualified for public office by
j Mac Arthur's directives and replace
j them with individuals who could
i carry on a stop-gap government un
j til general elections.
A second group felt that the
' cabinet membership did not come
! under the MaeArthur directives.
Resignation of the entire cabinet
was favored by a third faction
which felt the government would
be taking only a half-way meas
ure if it attempted a reorganiza
tion now.
I Most government members ap
j peared to favor the first course. They
i pointed out that it would be difficult
| to form an entire cabinet of fresh
| men now, because the "new blood"
' in Japanese political circles would
( want to wait until elections were
I held. Chief duty of the Shidehara
| government is to arrange and carry
| out honest elections, Japanese poli
ticians said, and it will fall automat
ically after the ballots are counted.
