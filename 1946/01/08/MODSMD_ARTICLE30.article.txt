### STANLEY WILSON 
For my initial effort of the current quarter, this
department would like to hang out a large Wel
come sign to returning students and you mis
informed friends who struggled through last
quarter with me.
It must have been a great vacation for all,
judfjing from the increase in the size of all bags
under the individual students' eyes on Reg Day.
That, plus an abundance of blood shot eyes
cinched the deal.
Bui things go on much the same even with the
shange of quarters. Terry still doesn't know the
v/ar is over, Smilin' Jack is still coming to the
rescue of buxom young things, and Tracy sur
vived another gruesome torture and is ready
for another. Personally, if the latter had not sur
vived the starve treatment I would enjoy my
breakfasts appreciably more.
It is great to see so many of the older men re
turning to campus, but hardly gratifying to see
the disillusionment that came to them when
they were thrown into the rigors of registering
and finding a place to lay their heads and hang
their clothes.
Naturally we are sorry that the situation ex
ists, but perhaps a little more thought on the
subject of returning Stanford to pre-war stand
ards will instigate a movement which, will ac
complish just that.
This will be a great year of reconversion and
reconstruction the world over. We might well
apply that movement right here. What with a
maximum enrollment this quarter, sports com
ing back on a full time scale, and a probability
that the fraternities will be returned by next
Fall, it is time we did some extensive construc
tive thinking and acting.
Naturally enough many changes had to be
enacted on campus during the war to meet the
existing crises as they presented themselves.
But that is over, we are back together as a col
lege unit, and our responsibility is to insure the
possibility of returning Stanford to the standards
evident in the pre-wa/ years.
No longer are our minds in fields of war, nor
are our efforts to be conducted along short term
considerations. This is a new year, a new quar
ter, and the beginning of a new Stanford. It is
time that the students of the University once
more take the reins and plan for a year of re

construction. It will not be accomplished with
out an organized effort and expression of opin
ion—not by a few individuals, but by the bloc
of us students. Enuf said.

Between Tom and Jerries this vacation I did
have time to whip through a book worth men
tioning. White Tower, by James Ullman, brings
together the usual suspense and co'nguest
routine, but this time it takes place on the side
of a wind and snow swept mountain. I've had
frost bite on my fingers ever since reading the
little document, and it's well worth while. Give
it a try between classes.
What with all the big talk going on about the
movie, Lost Weekend, I'd like to pass on a little
experience I had with just such a situation over
the holidays.
I chanced to meet one of these alcoholics in
one of the local home-town pubs, and alv/ays
one to hi*ar something interesting, I began talk
ing with the dried up gent. (You realize of
course that it was a purely sociological experi
ment, and I took no part in the proceedings.) At
any rate, after much interesting discussion on
the benefits of 18-hour-a-day drinking, I came to
the pay-off guestion. I asked my newly-found
friend how his health was. The reply was some
thing like this: "Well, right now I feel fine, and
I'll go to bed feeling just wonderful. The only
time I don't feel so good is that ten minutes in
the morning before I get drunk again." Maybe
the guy has something at that!!

Between Tom and Jerries this vacation I did
have time to whip through a book worth men
tioning. White Tower, by James Ullman, brings
together the usual suspense and co'nguest
routine, but this time it takes place on the side
of a wind and snow swept mountain. I've had
frost bite on my fingers ever since reading the
little document, and it's well worth while. Give
it a try between classes.
What with all the big talk going on about the
movie, Lost Weekend, I'd like to pass on a little
experience I had with just such a situation over
the holidays.
I chanced to meet one of these alcoholics in
one of the local home-town pubs, and alv/ays
one to hi*ar something interesting, I began talk
ing with the dried up gent. (You realize of
course that it was a purely sociological experi
ment, and I took no part in the proceedings.) At
any rate, after much interesting discussion on
the benefits of 18-hour-a-day drinking, I came to
the pay-off guestion. I asked my newly-found
friend how his health was. The reply was some
thing like this: "Well, right now I feel fine, and
I'll go to bed feeling just wonderful. The only
time I don't feel so good is that ten minutes in
the morning before I get drunk again." Maybe
the guy has something at that!!
For my initial effort of the current quarter, this
department would like to hang out a large Wel
come sign to returning students and you mis
informed friends who struggled through last
quarter with me.
It must have been a great vacation for all,
judfjing from the increase in the size of all bags
under the individual students' eyes on Reg Day.
That, plus an abundance of blood shot eyes
cinched the deal.
Bui things go on much the same even with the
shange of quarters. Terry still doesn't know the
v/ar is over, Smilin' Jack is still coming to the
rescue of buxom young things, and Tracy sur
vived another gruesome torture and is ready
for another. Personally, if the latter had not sur
vived the starve treatment I would enjoy my
breakfasts appreciably more.
It is great to see so many of the older men re
turning to campus, but hardly gratifying to see
the disillusionment that came to them when
they were thrown into the rigors of registering
and finding a place to lay their heads and hang
their clothes.
Naturally we are sorry that the situation ex
ists, but perhaps a little more thought on the
subject of returning Stanford to pre-war stand
ards will instigate a movement which, will ac
complish just that.
This will be a great year of reconversion and
reconstruction the world over. We might well
apply that movement right here. What with a
maximum enrollment this quarter, sports com
ing back on a full time scale, and a probability
that the fraternities will be returned by next
Fall, it is time we did some extensive construc
tive thinking and acting.
Naturally enough many changes had to be
enacted on campus during the war to meet the
existing crises as they presented themselves.
But that is over, we are back together as a col
lege unit, and our responsibility is to insure the
possibility of returning Stanford to the standards
evident in the pre-wa/ years.
No longer are our minds in fields of war, nor
are our efforts to be conducted along short term
considerations. This is a new year, a new quar
ter, and the beginning of a new Stanford. It is
time that the students of the University once
more take the reins and plan for a year of re

construction. It will not be accomplished with
out an organized effort and expression of opin
ion—not by a few individuals, but by the bloc
of us students. Enuf said.
