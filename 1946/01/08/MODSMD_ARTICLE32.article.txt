### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
TRUMAN AND LABOR
The recent heavy rains brought one promi
nent casualty, the powder in the giant fire
cracker that President Truman tossed at Con
gress. He waited until the congressmen were
among their constituents before he threw it,
waited until he thought it would hurt. The fuse
sputtered to its end over the airwaves, and the
result was a fizzling pop. The deluge of tele
grams, letters and protests that he had expected
would swamp Congress turned out to be a light,
almost imperceptible drizzle.
Congressional comment came quickly. Sena
tor Robert Taft took the microphone and pro
claimed that Congress should get credit instead
of rebuke for thinking twice about "Marxian leg
islation costing billions of dollars." After the
smoke of his invective cleared, the sound of a
chorus was heard chanting "The Democrats are
split, The Democrats have failed."
However, when it was just sinking in, an
other Republican came up with an answer to
Senator Taft. He branded Taft a reactionary, and
said that it was people like him who kept the
country from looking to the Republican party.
This little speech showed that it was more than
the Democrats who were divided over present
issues.
UNEMPLOYMENT
The president seemed to have three beefs
v/ith his Congress. The first was about the un
employment bill, which the House passed as he
wanted, but which the Senate cut up. The sec
ond was about the congressional idea to return
the Federal Employment Agency to the states.
The third was over pigeon-holing the famous
fact-finding legislation.
It seems that Congress is wise in holding up
passage of unemployment relief measures until
the situation clarifies. When the legislation was
introduced, prophets of woe on loan from Fed
eral Agencies predicted a dark situation. In
stead, unemployment is falling, instead of ris
ing, and too many people have the idea of start
ing off with federal aid instead of necessary, but
low-paid, jobs, and this is causing a shortage in
some sections of the labor force.
As for the Federal Employment Agency, its
reputation is old and well-established in Wash
ington. President Roosevelt used it as a pigeon
hole for shelving advisers who were a little too
far left of him, so the result has been a bunch of
bureaucrats discussing dialectic materialism
and the nation's employers looking elsewhere
for workers. It has not been run efficiently, and
a return to the state could not be any worse.
LABOR RELATIONS
The hesitation of Congress to do anything pos
itive about labor relations is not a good state of
affairs. The strikes are mounting, and they are
coming in key industries which control the na
tional economy. Fact-finding legislation might
not be much of a solution. A business expense
sheet is so complex that government "fact-find
ers" could come up with almost any solution
they wanted to. The Union is not bound to ac
cept the solution, and strikes would only be
postponed. Clearing the air with facts and fig
ures might help a little, but it would only do
that.
However, the unfortunate thing is that the
Congress doesn't have anything better to offer.
It isn't helping either the congressmen or the
nation. It would seem that labor arbitration, or
mediation, or what-have-you, is "must" legisla
tion, and the sooner and the more objectively it
is discussed, the better.

that.
However, the unfortunate thing is that the
Congress doesn't have anything better to offer.
It isn't helping either the congressmen or the
nation. It would seem that labor arbitration, or
mediation, or what-have-you, is "must" legisla
tion, and the sooner and the more objectively it
is discussed, the better.
TRUMAN AND LABOR
The recent heavy rains brought one promi
nent casualty, the powder in the giant fire
cracker that President Truman tossed at Con
gress. He waited until the congressmen were
among their constituents before he threw it,
waited until he thought it would hurt. The fuse
sputtered to its end over the airwaves, and the
result was a fizzling pop. The deluge of tele
grams, letters and protests that he had expected
would swamp Congress turned out to be a light,
almost imperceptible drizzle.
Congressional comment came quickly. Sena
tor Robert Taft took the microphone and pro
claimed that Congress should get credit instead
of rebuke for thinking twice about "Marxian leg
islation costing billions of dollars." After the
smoke of his invective cleared, the sound of a
chorus was heard chanting "The Democrats are
split, The Democrats have failed."
However, when it was just sinking in, an
other Republican came up with an answer to
Senator Taft. He branded Taft a reactionary, and
said that it was people like him who kept the
country from looking to the Republican party.
This little speech showed that it was more than
the Democrats who were divided over present
issues.
UNEMPLOYMENT
The president seemed to have three beefs
v/ith his Congress. The first was about the un
employment bill, which the House passed as he
wanted, but which the Senate cut up. The sec
ond was about the congressional idea to return
the Federal Employment Agency to the states.
The third was over pigeon-holing the famous
fact-finding legislation.
It seems that Congress is wise in holding up
passage of unemployment relief measures until
the situation clarifies. When the legislation was
introduced, prophets of woe on loan from Fed
eral Agencies predicted a dark situation. In
stead, unemployment is falling, instead of ris
ing, and too many people have the idea of start
ing off with federal aid instead of necessary, but
low-paid, jobs, and this is causing a shortage in
some sections of the labor force.
As for the Federal Employment Agency, its
reputation is old and well-established in Wash
ington. President Roosevelt used it as a pigeon
hole for shelving advisers who were a little too
far left of him, so the result has been a bunch of
bureaucrats discussing dialectic materialism
and the nation's employers looking elsewhere
for workers. It has not been run efficiently, and
a return to the state could not be any worse.
LABOR RELATIONS
The hesitation of Congress to do anything pos
itive about labor relations is not a good state of
affairs. The strikes are mounting, and they are
coming in key industries which control the na
tional economy. Fact-finding legislation might
not be much of a solution. A business expense
sheet is so complex that government "fact-find
ers" could come up with almost any solution
they wanted to. The Union is not bound to ac
cept the solution, and strikes would only be
postponed. Clearing the air with facts and fig
ures might help a little, but it would only do
that.
