# Ancient 'Arrowsmith' Show With Dated Technique
## 
### 
ARROWSMITII — Now playing at
the Varsity Theater
"Arrowsmith," Sinclair Lewis's
plodding, episodic novel of a young
doctor, was evidently tailored by
Sam Goldwyn to suit the matinee
audiences of 1931. Because when

viewed today, 15
years later, it
certainly seems
hopeless. Both
acting and pro
duction tech
niques are about
as dated as my
ancient grand
mother's two
step. Possibly
"Arrowsmith" at
tracted rave no-

tices at its date of conception, but
today the best one can do is laugh
politely and feel sorry for the mo
tion picture audiences of a genera
tion ago.
Ronald Colman, he of the manner
blithe and debonair, is cast as Mar
tin Arrowsmith, a person who seems
both ambitious and frustrated at the
same time. His early college years,
his country practice in a small South
Dakota hamlet, and his experiences
in a high-pressured research insti
tute, which played such a major role
in the book, are brushed aside light
ly in the cineversion and as a result
the early stages of the film appear
jerky and ill-constructcd.
West Indian Plague
Most of the picture is instead ded
icated to his escapades in combating
a West Indian plague that kills his
wife (Helen Hayes). From there the
action transfers back to the research
laboratory, where Martin finally de
cides to devote his life to experi
mentation.
The picture is overacted through
out and assumes almost farcical pro
portions at times. Of interest, how
ever, is the bit l'ole played by Myr
na Loy, who says but two lines even
though she receives feature billing
on the marquee outside. Times have
changed. Luckily Miss Loy has done
ihe fame.
You'll laugh at "Arrowsmith." But
please don't do so in the presence of

your elders. It will make them feel
awfully old.
Second Feature
The second feature on the Var
sity doubleheader is "The Crystal
Ball," a rather ribald comedy that
reveals moments of illumination.
Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard
are at home in their respective roles
of lawyer and fortune-teller, while
Bill Bendix is seen in another of his
stooge parts. The only painful lines
of "The Crystal Ball" are those that
refer to the wartime difficulties of
the recent years.—Dick Bower

ancient grand
mother's two
step. Possibly
"Arrowsmith" at
tracted rave no-

tices at its date of conception, but
today the best one can do is laugh
politely and feel sorry for the mo
tion picture audiences of a genera
tion ago.
Ronald Colman, he of the manner
blithe and debonair, is cast as Mar
tin Arrowsmith, a person who seems
both ambitious and frustrated at the
same time. His early college years,
his country practice in a small South
Dakota hamlet, and his experiences
in a high-pressured research insti
tute, which played such a major role
in the book, are brushed aside light
ly in the cineversion and as a result
the early stages of the film appear
jerky and ill-constructcd.
West Indian Plague
Most of the picture is instead ded
icated to his escapades in combating
a West Indian plague that kills his
wife (Helen Hayes). From there the
action transfers back to the research
laboratory, where Martin finally de
cides to devote his life to experi
mentation.
The picture is overacted through
out and assumes almost farcical pro
portions at times. Of interest, how
ever, is the bit l'ole played by Myr
na Loy, who says but two lines even
though she receives feature billing
on the marquee outside. Times have
changed. Luckily Miss Loy has done
ihe fame.
You'll laugh at "Arrowsmith." But
please don't do so in the presence of

your elders. It will make them feel
awfully old.
Second Feature
The second feature on the Var
sity doubleheader is "The Crystal
Ball," a rather ribald comedy that
reveals moments of illumination.
Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard
are at home in their respective roles
of lawyer and fortune-teller, while
Bill Bendix is seen in another of his
stooge parts. The only painful lines
of "The Crystal Ball" are those that
refer to the wartime difficulties of
the recent years.—Dick Bower

ARROWSMITII — Now playing at
the Varsity Theater
"Arrowsmith," Sinclair Lewis's
plodding, episodic novel of a young
doctor, was evidently tailored by
Sam Goldwyn to suit the matinee
audiences of 1931. Because when

viewed today, 15
years later, it
certainly seems
hopeless. Both
acting and pro
duction tech
niques are about
as dated as my
ancient grand
mother's two
step. Possibly

tices at its date of conception, but
