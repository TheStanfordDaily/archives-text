### ART LEVINSON 
Another quarter has rolled in. Coming in this quarter is inter
collegiate basketball, abandoned for two seasons during the war.
Stanford producer of some of the greatest names in basketball
history- r is resuming its niche on the sports horizon. Like other
post-war projects, the road is not easy, and is not paved with vic
tories along the line. Our mediocre start in basketball will prove
that point. But the main thing is that the Stanford Indian is on the
loose again. Other schools beware! The Indian is on a scalping
mission!
Coach Everett Dean has been plagued with hard luck the
whole season. Tom Rodman and Bill Christiansen, two stellar
guards are out with injuries. Rod Lamb has been drafted. Paul
Chilson has been declared ineligible. Several boys that were
counted on to help the team didn't enroll this quarter.
BRIGHT SIDE
But there is a bright side, too. Tom Murphy has transferred
from the University of Michigan, and helped out the squad im
measurably in the Trojan series last week-end down south. An
other late edition to the squad is Gene Martin, who played a
bang-up game at halfback for the football squad during our brief
gridiron season.
We are informed that there are a few tickets left for the bas
ketball game Friday night in the Pavilion, and those that are
planning on going—and who isn't? should trot over to the B.A.C.
pronto to get a ticket for the game. The admission is four-bits.
Imagine!
NO MORE SURF BOARDS
By the way, if there are any stout-hearted students who have
actions of the beloved Sports staff in past quarters for wandering
off Stanford sports, we can now slate good news. With plenty ot
sports activities aroun' the Farm, it won't be necessary to go into
such subjects as surf board riding at San Onofre, boxing at Alviso
and Lompoc, and wrestling in San Diego. Those days are gone
forever. A new era has begun. The Daily sports staff —though
still undermanned —will be poking their noses into things around
the campus, and anything important, and things not so important,
too, will reel off the Remington.
By the way, if there are any stou-hearted students who have
that journalistic urge, and feel that they are another Damon Run
yon, or Bill Corum, hobble over to the Daily Shack. We need you!
