## Alabamans Electrify Crowds—Baffle S.C. 
### ART LEVINSON 
Another Rose Bowl classic has gone into the record books. This writer
—who had the extremely good fortune of obtaining ducats for the gridiron
festivity—only wishes to add a few post-mortem comments about the
Arroyo Seco affair in Pasadena.
The invading Crimson Tide from Alabama electrified a jam-packed
crowd of 93,000 spectators with a i

dazzling game of football, and com
pletely befuddled their hosts for the
game, the Trojans of U.S.C. From
the time Bobby Morris fumbled the
pigskin in the early moments of the
encounter to the waning moments in
the game, the Alabamans displayed
a classy, pre-war brand of football.
Leading this sharp attack was Harry
Gilmer, who lived up to every inch
of press clippings claiming his great
football prowess.
In direct contrast to the wide
awake sharpness of the Dixieland
boys, the Trojans looked miserably
slow. Their tackling was sloppy.
Their blocking was poor. Their of
fense—what little there was of it—
was dull and lacked precision.
Miscellaneous Notes
The advertising aerial display
overhead provided more amusement
to some than did the one-sided pig
skin game on {he field. What was
particularly amusing was when a
plane, pulling along an ad for a
certain 3.2 beverage, and another
plane hauling an ad for a "morning
after" remedy nearly collided.
A sight that set everybody into a
complete drool was when Admiral
"Bull" Halsey was driven into the
Pasadena football saucer in a new
Ford convertible two-door sedan
station wagon. Everybody agreed
that the naval man was much bet
ter off in that blessed piece of auto
motive ingeniousness than riding
around on some nag, as he previous
ly proclaimed he would like to do.
No Majorettes
Frank Bull, the Associated foot
ball caster, sat next to me, and he
remarked that the only reason that
he ever brought binoculars to a
football game was to look to the
drum majorettes, and he was dis
appointed to see that both of the
bands at the game were led by mas
culine manipulators of the baton.
Perhaps in fairness to U.S.C.,
nothing great should have been ex
pected of them. Their team had only
mediocre success this season losing
three games. West Coast football
dropped a few notches in stature
with the poor showing of the Tro
jans in the game.« Let us hope that
Stanford will drive up that barome
ter next season. Maybe we'll even
play in the Rose Bowl.

A sight that set everybody into a
complete drool was when Admiral
"Bull" Halsey was driven into the
Pasadena football saucer in a new
Ford convertible two-door sedan
station wagon. Everybody agreed
that the naval man was much bet
ter off in that blessed piece of auto
motive ingeniousness than riding
around on some nag, as he previous
ly proclaimed he would like to do.
No Majorettes
Frank Bull, the Associated foot
ball caster, sat next to me, and he
remarked that the only reason that
he ever brought binoculars to a
football game was to look to the
drum majorettes, and he was dis
appointed to see that both of the
bands at the game were led by mas
culine manipulators of the baton.
Perhaps in fairness to U.S.C.,
nothing great should have been ex
pected of them. Their team had only
mediocre success this season losing
three games. West Coast football
dropped a few notches in stature
with the poor showing of the Tro
jans in the game.« Let us hope that
Stanford will drive up that barome
ter next season. Maybe we'll even
play in the Rose Bowl.


EVERETT DEAN
His squad meets Cal this week
Another Rose Bowl classic has gone into the record books. This writer
—who had the extremely good fortune of obtaining ducats for the gridiron
festivity—only wishes to add a few post-mortem comments about the
Arroyo Seco affair in Pasadena.
The invading Crimson Tide from Alabama electrified a jam-packed
crowd of 93,000 spectators with a i

dazzling game of football, and com
pletely befuddled their hosts for the
game, the Trojans of U.S.C. From
the time Bobby Morris fumbled the
pigskin in the early moments of the
encounter to the waning moments in
the game, the Alabamans displayed
a classy, pre-war brand of football.
Leading this sharp attack was Harry
Gilmer, who lived up to every inch
of press clippings claiming his great
football prowess.
In direct contrast to the wide
awake sharpness of the Dixieland
boys, the Trojans looked miserably
slow. Their tackling was sloppy.
Their blocking was poor. Their of
fense—what little there was of it—
was dull and lacked precision.
Miscellaneous Notes
The advertising aerial display
overhead provided more amusement
to some than did the one-sided pig
skin game on {he field. What was
particularly amusing was when a
plane, pulling along an ad for a
certain 3.2 beverage, and another
plane hauling an ad for a "morning
after" remedy nearly collided.
