# Cards Face Cal Friday
## 
### 
With not much more than a wing
and a prayer, the hardwood Indians
of the Farm bump noggins with a
red-hot hoop troupe from Cal Fri
day night at the basketball pavilion.
With 15 wins in 17 starts behind
them, Cal, a rangy, fast sharp-shoot
ing outfit, is currently riding the
crest as favorite to tuck away the
P.C.C.'s southern division bunting.
Of Stanford, alas. It's been a long
time since the Big Reds have been
such an out-and-out underdog. Even
Coach Everett Dean has little more
than hope, although, as the jolly
mentor says, "Basketball is a funny
game."
Foremost on the agenda for the
Cards is the securing of a number
of replacements for their riddled
ranks. A stellar guard, Chris Chris
tianson, was removed early in the
second S.C. tilt with an injured foot
and is indefinitely unavailable. Tom
Rodman, another guard, wound up
Friday's game with an injured knee,
and is on the injured and unavail
able list.
A third of Dean's four guards,
Rodney Lamb, has been lost to the
Armed Forces, via the draft. Yes,
it's still with us. Only replacement
for the back court spots so far is
Gene Martin, a fast-developing for
ward who was moved up to starting
g.uard.
Couple that to Cal's twin victories
over defending champion U.C.L.A.,
and the statement that the Indians
have a prayer sounds optimistic. A
mob of seasoned veterans, includ
ing scoring leader Andy Wolfe
(fourth in the U.S.) and the Bears
seem set for a runaway.
But—Stanford's playing at home
before a home crowd Friday, at
least, and the intangible little some
thing called spirit can produce No. 1
of the season's upsets. (I'll pick Cal
—let's hope I'm wrong.)—Farkas
