BERLIN, Jan. 7 (UP).â€”Two thou
sand Jewish refugees from Poland,
whom the Russians planned to evac
uate from their sector of Berlin to a
camp north of the city, "disap
peared" during the night and were
expected to filter into the crowded
American and British zones.
The French, learning that the ref
ugees were at large, at once closed
j their sector to further arrivals.
