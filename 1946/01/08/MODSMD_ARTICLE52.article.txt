# Track Team Holds Initial Workout
## 
### 
Stanford's Varsity track team had
their first workout this afternoon
under the direction of Coach Jack
Weirshauser. The team has some
fair middle distance runners, but is
pretty weak in the rest of the spots.
Coach Weirshauser stressed the j
need of more material and urged
that any man interested in track,
whether he has had any experience
or not, to come out for track. There
are plenty of openings on the team.
Stanford in the past has been noted
for a strong track team. It boasts of
two winners in the Olympic games,
one in 1928 and another in 1932.
Stanford has also held 14 world rec
ords.
As stated above, experience is not
a prerequisite for the track team.
Any one who is interested is desired
and needed for the team. Students j
now more than ever have a better !
chance to make the team. Freshman
and sophomores should be especial
ly interested in this fact. It takes
more than a year to train a good
track man, and by the time you
present sophomore are upperclass
men you will be top track men.
