Finding the right gi'l fÂ°'' the right job has established the reputation of ,
the Stanford Y.W.C.A. eommunity service committee as liaison between
campus women and worth-while community projects.
Women Assist Scouts
"We've had a great deal of co-operation both from Stanford women and

I\ilo Alto civic leaders," said Mar- *
jorie Ambler, explaining the success
of the committee she heads.
Approximately 20 girls are now
assisting or leading Girl Scout troops |
in Palo Alto and on the campus. |
"Many of the nirls who go out to i
help with Girl Scout work contrib- l
ute some specific skill, said Miss J
Ambler, ;is she explained that some i
move from troop to troop assisting i
in singing or in crafts. Patsy Bell
heads the Girl Scout committee un
der Miss Ambler.
Once a week during the quarter,
Stanford women have gone to the
Redwood City Juvenile Delinquent
Home to entertain the 14- and 16-
yeai-old girls held there for trial.
The committee hopes to expand the
program to daily work, said Miss
Ambler, explaining the committee
has plans to purchase records and
sheet music for the Home.
'Y' Entertains Veterans
Paula Wilbur headed the com
munity service committee that pre
pared Thanksgiving posters for Dib
ble Hospital at the request of the
Red Cross. Cornucopia posters were
painted in the "Y" lounge to blight
en the hospital wards.
Twenty-five girls have gone once
a month to the Veterans Hospital to
entertain psycho-neurotic patients.
"We hope to be able to go twice a
month next quarter," said Miss Am
bler. The girls, under the chairman
ship of Nancv Banning, dance and

talk to the veterans in the hospital
j recreation hall.
