# California 'On Own'--Warren
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO', Jan. 7 (UP).—
Gov. Earl Warren told the state leg
islature today that California must
now start solving its own postwar
problems without relying on outside
help, as a joint meeting of senate
and assembly members listened to
his opening address at the special
"reconversion" session.
The governor spoke to the legisla
tors shortly after noon, devoting half
an hour to detailing his plans for
meeting problems of housing vet
erans, racial relations, public health,
public works and others.
Warren said that during the war
most of the direction came from
the federal government but that
"now we are largely on our own
again," and as many of the prob
lems "have their roots in the state,
their solution can start at the same
source."
He declared the state should pro
mote the use of idle war housing as
an aid to veterans because "the men
who fought in the foxholes have re
turned to find less of a home here
than they had over there." Also, he
said, a state housing agency should
be established to determine "what
the housing situation is at all times."
