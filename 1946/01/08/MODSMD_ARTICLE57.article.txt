# 110 Foreign Students Aided By Committee
## 
### MARY ANN McCOMB 
The function of the Foreign Stu- j
dents' Committee, according to Dr. :
H. Donald Winbiglpr, registrar and j
head of the committee, is to study
the problems of the foreign students
on campus and make recommenda
tions to the regular University agen
cies on ways and means of making
experiences at Stanford more effec- i
tive to these students.
At present there are 110 foreign ;
students registered at Stanford, said
Dr. Winbigler. They come from
China, Canada, England, Turkey,
South America, Central America,
Iran, Mexico, Philippine Islands,
West Indies, Greece, Switzerland.
Newfoundland, Alaska, and Hawaii.
Dr. Winbigler stated that he hesi
tates to include the students from
Hawaii and Alaska in the classifi
cation of foreign students, because
they don't consider themselves any
more foreign than do the students
from Texas. Additional applications
for admission are on file from Pales
tine, India, Egypt, and Iceland.
In some cases a group from one
country has come to Stanford for
the same purpose. For example,
there arc a number of Turkish
! students who were sent here spe
j cifically to do engineering work.
Many Chinese students are doing
work in education. The School
i of Medicine is receiving an in
creasing number of requests from
Oriental and South and Central
' American countries. There arc
not enough students from most
of the countries to generalize in
this way, however.
In many instances Stanford has
been recommcndcd by Americans
who have taught in foreign univer
sities or by students who have taken
work here or who have known
members of the Stanford faculty
! and recommend that they work with
I them, Dr. Winbigler pointed out.
Usually the foreign student comes
to Stanford for some specific pro

fessional or occupational work.
The chances arc that Stanford
will he receiving increased num
bers of students at the graduate
level from the Orient, according
to Dr. Winhigler. China, in par
ticular, is encouraging its students
to patronize home institutions at
the undergraduate level, and then
qualify for graduate training
abroad.
Stanford has also had guest pro
fessors from foreign countries. Dur
ing spring quarter Dr. A. Pen-Tung
Sah, who was in this country as a
guest of the State Department, was
a visiting professor of electrical en
gineering here. He took his degree
at Stanford in 1924 and is now presi
dent of the University of Amoy.
Most of the last year, the For
eign Students' Committee has de
voted to the problems of the for
eign student in the English lan
guage. M-any of these students
have learned English in much the
same way as we learn French,
German, or Italian at secondary
or collegiate levels. They are at
a considerable disadvantage in
I competing in classes with native
American students. Very often,
! before they can carry university
work effectively, they need ex
tensive work in idiomatic Amer
j ican English.
To take care of this need, Stan
: ford offers special courses in writ
j ten and oral English especially
I planned for them. They are: Eng
lish F, English for Foreign Students
and Speech and Drama 48 and 49

and Spoken English for Foreign Stu
dents. The Foreign Students' Com
mittee recommends that each for
eign student avail himself of these
courses his first quarter here.
This year the committee is mov
ing to other problematic areas, to
make other recommendations re
garding the life of foreign stu
dents on the campus. Their ob
jective is to help these students
to become a regular part of the
Stanford student body, to enable
them to take full advantage of
the educational opportunities, to
see that they are set apart in no
way except what is absolutely
necessary in helping them to meet
their special problems, and to help
them become acclimated to life
in this country.
Dr. Winbigler states that all over
the world renewed interest in
American education is noticeable.
Stanford, along with other univer
sities, is getling its share as increas
ing numbers of students from for
eign countries are thinking of doing
work here, he concluded.
