# Farm's 'Red Barn' Reopens In Sprint
## 
### LYNN COX 
Stanford's "Red Barn," the former
stables for Leland Stanford's fa
mous horses, is on its way to a glori
ous return to activity with a new
coat of red paint, many internal im
provements, and a complete stock of
riding horses, according to Dr. Don
ald B. Tresidder, president of Stan
ford University.
Although the lack of workmen
has delayed the completion of the
work on the barn, it ought to begin
| operation for pleasure riding some-
I time this quarter, and a regular
schedule of operation set up by
I spring quarter. Dr. Tresidder out
lined the plan under which the barn
will be operated, and stated that its
main use will be for the students.
Training Classes
The foremost function of the sta
bles will be the keeping of a stock
of riding horses for training classes
for men and women. Under the di
rection of a competent staff of in
structors, riding will be offered as
one of the regular gym courses. For
a flat fee, lessons in all phases of
horsemanship will be given.
Mr. Alfred R. Masters, Director
of Athletics and Physical Training,
is now in charge of the arrange
ments for the administration of the
barn.
Secondly, students of the Uni
j versity will he allowed to rent
| horses from the stables by the
hour or half-day for their own
riding enjoyment. Horses will also
he available for the faculty and
members of the administrative
i stall, to the extent that they are
! not in use by classes or individual
j students.
In addition, the barn has been en
larged so that it is hoped students
who wish may board their own
horses for their own use here at
Stanford, the number and rates to
be announced later.
Riding Events Planned
With the return of the equestrian
I art to Stanford, many riding events
| such as week-end horseback break
fasts, moonlight rides, and club af
fairs will be planned.
The "Red Barn," located at the
j end of Governor's Lane, has a brilâ€”
I liant yet rather sentimental history
i behind it, as it is one of the oldest
buildings on the campus. Leland

Stanford had a very keen interest in
horses, especially for speed. In 187G
he began the acquisition of the Palo
Alto Farm land for the purpose of
breeding and training fast horses.
Stanford's Palo Alto Stock Farm was
well under way before the city of
Palo Alto came into being.
Through the merits of such fa
mous horses as Hindu Rose, Wild
llowcr, Manzanita, Sunol, and Palo
Alto, Stanford became known in
the horseman's world for his line
breeding of fast horses. He de
veloped breeding to the point of a
science, doing much research with
the aid of photography, and writ
ing numerous articles on his find
ings.
On the original Stanford ranch,
the present "Red Barn" was one of
two stables. Only trotting horses
were kept and trained here. An
other barn, out toward Mayfield, was
for the keeping of thoroughbreds.
Since cars were non-existent at that
date, Governor's Lane was a busy
bridle path and riding of all kinds
was the sport for men. In his youth,
Leland Stanford, Junior, spent many
happy days riding on the many vast
acres of the Stanford ranch.
Organizations Contribute
Dr. Tresidder again called atten
tion to the fact that the work on the
barn at present, the painting, re
modeling so as to double the capaci
ty, and the securing of horses, is all
being made possible by contribu
tions of various groups of students
and student organizations who arc
eager to revive the institution of
ihe barn.
With the renewing of the barn it
self will come many improvements
of the surrounding territory, espe
cially in the planning of bridle paths.
One five-mile path would cover
Governor's Lane, going in a circle
winding up at the barn again. Also

a training ring, troughs, and pas
tures will be instituted in order to
complete the stable setup.
The last riding establishment for
Stanford students was under the
sponsorship of the K.O.T.C. Sta
bles and a polo field were located
near the stadium. This plan was
dropped, however, at the coining
of the war.
Stanford is one of the few large
schools able to develop a program
of horseback riding because of its
excellent country setting and many
open spaces. The rolling hills, the
woods, and the beautiful surround
ings ofTer enticements to horseback
riding seldom equaled so close to
such a large university.

MANILA, Monday, Jan. 7 (UP).
A new mass meeting of demonstrat
ing soldiers began to form before
Army headquarters in City Hall
early today after military police
were called out yesterday to control
parades by 2,000 homesick Gl's.
The capital was tense and all mil
itary police battalions were alerted
for emergency duty as the soldiers
began their second day of demon
strations against War Department
orders slowing down the redeploy
ment rate for troops overseas.
