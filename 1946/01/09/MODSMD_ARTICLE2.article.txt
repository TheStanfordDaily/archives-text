## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP).â€”
President Truman said today the
United States has no reason to be
lieve that Russia possesses an atom
ic bomb, and he heartily endorsed
Secretary of State James F. Byrnes'
stand on . the international atomic
issue.
In a statement Monday before
leaving for London, Byrnes assured
the nation that its atomic interests
are fully protected an that it will
not be forced to give up any bomb
secret as a result of the recent Mos
cow agreements.
Mr. Truman told his news con
ference that Byrnes' statement
should satisfy anyone who had
doubts about international con
trol. Sen. Arthur 11. Vandenberg,
11.. Mich., had expressed fears that
a proposed commission to estab
lish control over atomic energy*
might he mended when Byrnes
meets with the delegation in Lon
don tomorrow prior to the open
ing meeting of the UNO assem
bly.
The President's view that Russia
does not possess an atomic bomb
was prompted by a story from Lon
donderry, northern Ireland, that
Russia has developed a bomb which
makes the Anglo-American weapon
obsolete.
