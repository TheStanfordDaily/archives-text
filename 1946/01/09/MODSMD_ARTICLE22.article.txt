A certain news commentator, purring bliss
fully . ong, gave us a sudden jolt the other af
tcrnc ,n as he came forth with his contention
th.it v. hat the American public needed to soothe
its 1; nbled post-war spirits was to engage in a
seri. ;; of fads similar to the Ouiji board and mah
jong crazes after World War I! American peo
ple are uneasy, he said; strikes, the atomic
bomb, UNRRA all those things worry them;
they ] an outlet! Well, on that one we left
fj i• nd news commentator with his head in the
Sun-.], but with the reflection that however you
looked at it the American people probably
Wo iid qo overboard for a dozen new fads in the
near future.
They have them in college too, right in the
mid.ji of all the "internationally-minded," only
the names of the fads may be slightly different
- perhaps more sophisticated, such as "Occupa
tion -Jth obtaining a date for Saturday night,"
112 tc. fut maybe—just maybe —there aren't quite
so m my people in universities who are so will
ing to drown their troubles in a post-war fad.
Mn ybc: the years '41 to '45 taught a few people a
little . out the importance of thinking and dis
cu .-si j and, perhaps, doing something about
world and national affairs. There have been
signs of such a movement here: the student
atonic bomb committee hastily organized at
the id of last quarter; the American Veterans'
rnlttee, now in formation stage in these
parts, which has published commendable
idc il . Similar organizations, or just the exist
ence among students of a desire to concern
themselves with community and world affairs
may make it just a little more difficult for the
Ouiji board addict to make headway. We're
.hopeful, anyway.
