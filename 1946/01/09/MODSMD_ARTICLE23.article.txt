Perhaps this is a little late to be writing c.
memorial for one who passed away during the
Christmas vacation, but for one who contributed
so much to our daily lives, our joys and our
coiv.iant conversations, it would be a crime to
let him pass on without mention.
'his man made his appearance during the
FalJ quarter, and although he was only with us
a short time, he will live in our memories for
ever. (lis witty sayings, his unorthodox actions,
and his ingenious ways of doing things were a

Obnoxious Dick.
Yes, Itchy, you were a humanitarian, and the
people's choice. We loved you and even suf
