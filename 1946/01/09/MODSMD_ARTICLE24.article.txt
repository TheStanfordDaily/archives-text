Tracy and we are glach Now the question is,
who will do the job? Will it be 8.0. Plenty?
Will it be Diet Smith, or will it be Milkshake
Meanie? Now there's a possibility. He's a dark
horse. Even Gould hasn't heard of him. At any
rate, a new era began with your appearance, j
We will carry on in the reflected light of your
glory and sacrifice.
And so now 1 would like to submit just one
suggestion regarding the inscription on your
tombstone. I would like it to be simple and to
the point. I would like it to read: Scratch One
Itchy.
