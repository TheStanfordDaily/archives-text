â€”Elliot Epsteen
Mr. Byrnes has been much praised and much
blamed for his work at the Moscow conference
Some claim that he brought Russia back into
the framework of international organization.
Others assert that he gave way on every major
point.
True, he did drop his protests over the infa
mous Balkan situation after getting very slight
improvements. He did give Russia a say in the
handling of Japan. But the main criticism should
be that he did not discuss the important ele
ments of friction in the present international
conflict.
IMPORTANT POINTS
The Jugoslavian Army, which, instead of de
mobilizing, is calling up new cadres, is poised
on the Macedonian border, probably waiting for
the British to evacuate Greece. Jugoslavia's new
president, Marshal Tito, has been speaking
about Macedonia belonging to Jugoslavia. If
Russia's puppet state controlled this Greek
province, the British bases in the Aegean sea
would be encircled by a ring of possibly hostile
airpower, and units of the Royal Navy would be
cut off from the Dardenelles. There was no re
quest for Tito to demobilize, nor any statement
of policy about this situation.
Azerbaijan was sidestepped neatly by Molo
tov. He claimed that the revolution in that
Iranian province was spontaneous. Byrnes said,
"Then why not withdraw and let affairs settle
themselves." Molotov refused to do this.
Azerbaijan, however, has a reputation as be
ing the most Chauvanistic of the Iranian prov
inces. Without Russian aid, the new govern
ment there might collapse. This is why Moscow
might not have wanted to withdraw.
LEBANON
To make matters worse, Russia is now sup
porting Lebanon which has been somewhat hos
tile to the British and French, and a significant
sentence in the Moscow note to that country
stated that Russia had no objections to that
country's territorial claims. This should have
some repercussions in diplomatic circles.
The control of Japan by five powers instead
of one might be very cumbersome. However
national pride figured into the decision. Secre
tary Byrnes tried as hard as he could to estab
lish a system of interim directives to cut down
red tape, and something was done. The com
promise made was not too injurious to our in
terests, but we should have made more of a
bargain for it.
KOREA
Korea, however, might represent a problem.
It has been put under joint American and Rus
sian trusteeship for the next five years. At the
end of that time, it will be an independent
state.
However Russia controls northern Korea, and
has a veto power in general Korean affairs. The
northern half of the country is the industrial
part. By vetoing imports of machinery produced
in the north from abroad, and by charging
high prices for the goods made up there, Russia
might try to start another separatist movement
as she did in Iran. A Soviet-controlled govern
ment could say, "Look at the higher prices you
can get if you stay independent and under us."
Such a move could prejudice the independ
ence of all of Korea as well as impose a threat
to Chinese retention of Manchuria, and should
be guarded against. However, this is a bridge
we have yet to come to.
ATOMS
Under the Moscow agreement, America, Brit
ain, and Canada will make suggestions on atom
ic control to the Big Five. Any one of these
powers can veto them, and all of them are just
recommendations to the nations of the world.
This seems more of a political step than an
actual way of solving a problem. The organ
ization is too reminiscent of that of the various
League of Nations disarmament fiarcos.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
When Byrnes went to Moscow, he called the
conference. Its success or failure was on his
shoulders, and, if it failed, he might join Stet
tinius in near retirement. Thus a smewd bat
gainer, and Molotov is that, could make him
give up the most. What he seems to have done
was to sidestep major issues and give in on
minor ones after trying to get something done in
the former category. The Moscow conference,
then, seemed more of an effort to show the vot
ers that this administration was upholding Big
Throe unity than to really accomplish anything
