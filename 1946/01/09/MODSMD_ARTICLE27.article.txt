# Legrand--Opera To French Class
## 
### 
By CAMILLA RYALL
Felix Legi'and, instructor of Ro- |
manic languages, is not only inter
ested in teaching French but is also j
a connoisseur of music.
Born in Po. France, Mr. Legrand
came to the United States some 15
years ago, on the invitation of his
aunt. Landing in New York, he
went straight to San Francisco. From )
there he went to Oregon, where he I
taught at the University.
Next Stop, Illinois
The University of Illinois was the
next stop for him and, while there,
he interested himself and others in
singing. Continuing with teaching j
French conversation and literature, I
Mr. Legrand went further north to j
.he Chicago area, where he lectured
on French folklore, music, and lit
erature.
All the while Mr. Legrand's in- !
terest in music continued, and while j
he lectured at Northwestern Uni- ;
versity he gained recognition as a
tenor.
Chicago Opera Singer
Mr, Legrand recalls with pleasure
;he days of singing with the Chi
cago Opera Company. Recalling the
story of a bombastic singer who,
raged her way through a Wagnerian 1
role because of a mishap on the side
wings particularly evokes a soft
laugh from Mr. Legrand.
Together with his accompanist. :
Mr. Legrand learned 150 folk songs
by heart. As well as knowing the
songs proper, they learned all the i
background material. The songs fell
into four categories: 1) songs of the
plow and land, 2) marriage, .')) chil
dren, and 4) love.
Music Colonics
Working with Louis Rousseau, a

member of the opera company, Mr.
Legrand and other musicians estab
lished music colonies in various
parts of Wisconsin.
Chicago soon became a familiar
.and welcome territory to Mr. Le
grand. He sang for all the important
clubs, including L'Alliance Fran
caise.
Closely Related
In comparing present-day music
with modern art, Mr. Legrand says
that they are very much tied up to
gether. It is almost impossible to
enter any of the arts singly without
at least touching some of them, he
said.
One docs not have to be extremely
emotional and overbearing to prove
that one is a musician. There are
certain fundamentals, such as the
use of harmonies, chords, and scales,
that need to be known, but the true
artist is able to continue and de
velop on his own. Debussy is an
example of this, in that he did not
finish a great many chords. In his
Cathedralc Engloufie, the listener is
expected to (ill in some of the sug
gested places.
Translated Broadcasts
During the war, Mr. Legi'and was
attached for some time to the Office
of War Information in San Fran
cisco. In that capacity he was a
translator of radio broadcasts in
tended for Frenchmen.
Mr. Legrand also was responsible
for the teaching of French to many
soldiers destined to land on his na
tive soil on D-Day. He says that
the main key to the course was the
fact that he used phonetics in teach
ing pronunciation.
