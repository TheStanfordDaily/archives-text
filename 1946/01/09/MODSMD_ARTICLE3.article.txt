# Dr. Willis Discusses ’Quakes
## 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis docs not wish it
to be assumed that he or any other
geologist can predict the occurrence
of an earthquake, he told a capacity
Tuesday Evening Series audience
last night, but he said that he should
not be surprised if this (California)
area experienced within the next
three or four years a shock similar
to that of 15)00.
Accidental Prediction
Dr. Willis recalled that in 1025 it
was rumored that he had predicted
an earthquake and one did occur
while he was in Santa Barbara,
causing him much discomfiture; but
he wished to discount the notion that
earth movements can be predicted
with any accuracy.
Stanford would not suffer greatly
if this happened. Dr. Willis com
mented, because of the foresight of
its builders. Lagunita, for instance,
is one of the safest structures in the
world, he said.
Layered Earth
In discussing his theory of the ori
gin of earthquakes and volcanoes,
Dr. Willis, professor of geology
emeritus, described the formation of
the earth's various layers. First, he
believes, there is a hard core of
molten metal at the center, then a
layer of crystalline rock, 1800 miles
thick, and on the surface the crust
which we know, comparable in
thickness to the skin on an apple.
The Stanford geologist, one of the
nation's most distinguished, de
scribed the expanding processes of
the molten core which he believes
give rise to the mountain ranges on
the earth's surface, such as the Sier
ra Nevada. The extremely dense
molten metal penetrates the crystal
line layer and emerges as granite
blocks which are our mountain
ranges, and basalt which forms the
ocean floor. A balance is achieved
between the two; otherwise the
earth's surface would be a universal
ocean and we should all be swim
ming about in it, Dr. Willis re
marked.
Earth Is Young
Dr. Willis maintained that the
earth is a comparatively young
body, not likely to exhaust its inner
energy for some millions of years.
Its movements are problems not
only for the geologist, but for the
chemist, physicist, mathematician
and astronomer.
In discussing the origins of volca
noes, Dr. Willis advanced the idea
that there are openings, similar to
tubes, leading from the center of
the earth, through which gases rise
and emerge in explosions which we
call volcanoes.
Local Movement
Of special interest to the audience
was Dr. Willis' explanation of the
earth movements in this area. Fa
miliar to Physical Science and Geol
ogy I students was his description of
the action which takes place along
the San Andreas fault when tre
mendous forces have accumulated.
Dr. Willis compared the vibrations
from the slip to those of a tuning
fork which has been struck.
Dr. Willis' interests have taken
him to many countries, continents,
and islands in the years since he
was graduated from the Columbia
School of Mines in 1878. The prob
lems concerning the earth are nu
merous and complex and man is be
coming more and more aware of his
own ignorance, he said, in advising
young people not to think that there
is nothing more to be discovered.
Dr. Willis concluded with a de
scription of his impression upon see
ing the Himalayas in India, visible
evidence of the youth of the earth.
Geology Leader
A. Irving Levorsen, head of the
Geology Department, introduced Dr.
Willis as one who has maintained
leadership for fd'ty years in his
profession and as one of Stanford':,
most distinguished faculty members.
Next week's Tuesday Evening Se
ries will be a lecture on architec
ture to be given in Cubberley Au
ditorium of the Education Building.

In discussing the origins of volca
noes, Dr. Willis advanced the idea
that there are openings, similar to
tubes, leading from the center of
the earth, through which gases rise
and emerge in explosions which we
call volcanoes.
Local Movement
Of special interest to the audience
was Dr. Willis' explanation of the
earth movements in this area. Fa
miliar to Physical Science and Geol
ogy I students was his description of
the action which takes place along
the San Andreas fault when tre
mendous forces have accumulated.
Dr. Willis compared the vibrations
from the slip to those of a tuning
fork which has been struck.
Dr. Willis' interests have taken
him to many countries, continents,
and islands in the years since he
was graduated from the Columbia
School of Mines in 1878. The prob
lems concerning the earth are nu
merous and complex and man is be
coming more and more aware of his
own ignorance, he said, in advising
young people not to think that there
is nothing more to be discovered.
Dr. Willis concluded with a de
scription of his impression upon see
ing the Himalayas in India, visible
evidence of the youth of the earth.

Willis as one who has maintained
leadership for fd'ty years in his
profession and as one of Stanford':,

Dr. Bailey Willis docs not wish it
to be assumed that he or any other
geologist can predict the occurrence
of an earthquake, he told a capacity
Tuesday Evening Series audience
last night, but he said that he should
not be surprised if this (California)
area experienced within the next
three or four years a shock similar
to that of 15)00.
Accidental Prediction
Dr. Willis recalled that in 1025 it
was rumored that he had predicted
an earthquake and one did occur
while he was in Santa Barbara,
causing him much discomfiture; but
he wished to discount the notion that
earth movements can be predicted
with any accuracy.
Stanford would not suffer greatly
if this happened. Dr. Willis com
mented, because of the foresight of
its builders. Lagunita, for instance,
is one of the safest structures in the
world, he said.
Layered Earth
In discussing his theory of the ori
gin of earthquakes and volcanoes,
Dr. Willis, professor of geology
emeritus, described the formation of
the earth's various layers. First, he
believes, there is a hard core of
molten metal at the center, then a
layer of crystalline rock, 1800 miles
thick, and on the surface the crust
which we know, comparable in
thickness to the skin on an apple.
The Stanford geologist, one of the
nation's most distinguished, de
scribed the expanding processes of
the molten core which he believes
give rise to the mountain ranges on
the earth's surface, such as the Sier
ra Nevada. The extremely dense
molten metal penetrates the crystal
line layer and emerges as granite
blocks which are our mountain
ranges, and basalt which forms the
ocean floor. A balance is achieved
between the two; otherwise the
earth's surface would be a universal
ocean and we should all be swim
ming about in it, Dr. Willis re
marked.
Earth Is Young
Dr. Willis maintained that the
earth is a comparatively young
body, not likely to exhaust its inner
energy for some millions of years.
Its movements are problems not
only for the geologist, but for the
chemist, physicist, mathematician
and astronomer.
