WASHINGTON. Jan. 8 (UP).
The White House was reported to
night to have asked Price Adminis
! trator Chester Bowles to have pre-
I liminary reviews of ceiling prices for
I steel and meat products available by
| Lhis week-end.
President Truman, who predicted
j a slight increase in steel prices, is
said to have suggested that some
definite report by OPA would help
! clarify the wage-price position of
the two industries and perhaps help
avert strikes called for next week.
OPA has begun regular reviews to
determine permissible increases in
producer prices under existing laws.
The complete studies are due by
Feb. 1 but Administration leaders
feel that a definite preliminary
statement would be important now.
Bowles, who visited the White
House yesterday, canceled a news
conference scheduled for tomorrow.
Neither Mr. Truman nor industry
j sources would say that the coming
, steel price rise would avert the
j strike by 700,000 members of the
United Steelworkers (CIO) called
for Monday.
The Labor Department was mak
ing eleventh-hour efforts to head off
j a nation-wide telephone strike ex
j pected to follow the strike of the
j American Communications Equip
ment Woikers (Ind.) scheduled for
11 a.m. tomorrow.
