After a few days of absolute confusion and pandemonium,
affairs at the Daily Shack are settling down to customary hum
drum of screaming and typewriter pounding. As usual, the Daily
Sports staff started off greatly under-staffed. Hatchetman Slobe,
former sports editor, wasn't around, and neither was Bob Gilkey,
dependable intra-mural man from guarters past.
El senor Slobe's sudden departure from active participation
on the time-honored Fourth Estate suddenly elevated this writer
to the top slot. We will do our best to call the Stanford sports
shots as best we can.
NEW ADDITION
Handling the assistant sports editor's chores is A 1 Sciaroni.
A 1 is a member of the committee which is reorganizing the intra
mural set-up at Stanford, so he is in a favorable spot to report "on
the-scenes" news.
. A welcome face to the little green office in the Daily Shack
was H. D. Thoreau. To Stanford students of two or three years
ago, H.D. needs no introduction. He was a high mogul on the
Chappie, and is also an ex-sports editor. He wrote a snappy Bull
Session, to add to his list of journalistic achievements on the
farm. H.D. will handle the basketball game write-ups, and will
report the track team news, too.
OTHERS NAMED
Another welcome face was that of Erwin Farkas. A newcomer
to the Stanford writing circle, but no novice in the journalism
game is Erwin. He worked on the Sporting Green section of the
San Francisco Chronicle, and is the Stanford correspondent for
the aforementioned paper.
A hold-over from last guarter is Slu Millar. Filling out the
rest of the staff is John Sabin, Phil Steinmetz, Jerry Evans, Ken
Rotenburg, and Ray Pasko. Quite a staff, eh? Once again mas
culinity is becoming to make its appearance around the Daily
Shack. Good!
SCHEDULE DRAWN UP
Now that the introductions and toasts are over, we would
like to mention the future sports this year at Stanford. Basketball
has already made the post-war jump. Baseball is on the hazy side
of the picture. A schedule has been drawn up with Cal, USC, and
UCLA.
The other two teams of the C.l.B.A.—California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association—St. Mary's and Santa Clara, haven't indi
cated their choice as to whether or not they will field baseball
nines this season. If they don't, we'll have to scurry around here
in an effort to line up games with other teams.
Minor sports like tennis, golf, and swimming are still in the
indefinite stage. Stanford plans on fielding teams in these sports
this year, but the actions the other schools will take is not known
yet. . . . That's all for today.

this year, but the actions the other schools will take is not known
yet. . . . That's all for today.
After a few days of absolute confusion and pandemonium,
affairs at the Daily Shack are settling down to customary hum
drum of screaming and typewriter pounding. As usual, the Daily
Sports staff started off greatly under-staffed. Hatchetman Slobe,
former sports editor, wasn't around, and neither was Bob Gilkey,
dependable intra-mural man from guarters past.
El senor Slobe's sudden departure from active participation
on the time-honored Fourth Estate suddenly elevated this writer
to the top slot. We will do our best to call the Stanford sports
shots as best we can.
NEW ADDITION
Handling the assistant sports editor's chores is A 1 Sciaroni.
A 1 is a member of the committee which is reorganizing the intra
mural set-up at Stanford, so he is in a favorable spot to report "on
the-scenes" news.
. A welcome face to the little green office in the Daily Shack
was H. D. Thoreau. To Stanford students of two or three years
ago, H.D. needs no introduction. He was a high mogul on the
Chappie, and is also an ex-sports editor. He wrote a snappy Bull
Session, to add to his list of journalistic achievements on the
farm. H.D. will handle the basketball game write-ups, and will
report the track team news, too.
OTHERS NAMED
Another welcome face was that of Erwin Farkas. A newcomer
to the Stanford writing circle, but no novice in the journalism
game is Erwin. He worked on the Sporting Green section of the
San Francisco Chronicle, and is the Stanford correspondent for
the aforementioned paper.
A hold-over from last guarter is Slu Millar. Filling out the
rest of the staff is John Sabin, Phil Steinmetz, Jerry Evans, Ken
Rotenburg, and Ray Pasko. Quite a staff, eh? Once again mas
culinity is becoming to make its appearance around the Daily
Shack. Good!
SCHEDULE DRAWN UP
Now that the introductions and toasts are over, we would
like to mention the future sports this year at Stanford. Basketball
has already made the post-war jump. Baseball is on the hazy side
of the picture. A schedule has been drawn up with Cal, USC, and
UCLA.
The other two teams of the C.l.B.A.—California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association—St. Mary's and Santa Clara, haven't indi
cated their choice as to whether or not they will field baseball
nines this season. If they don't, we'll have to scurry around here
in an effort to line up games with other teams.
Minor sports like tennis, golf, and swimming are still in the
indefinite stage. Stanford plans on fielding teams in these sports
this year, but the actions the other schools will take is not known
yet. . . . That's all for today.
