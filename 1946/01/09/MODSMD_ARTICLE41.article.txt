# Reds to Face Bears With Cards Down
## 
### 
From where we sit, about the only
thing that won't (or shouldn't) hap
pen to the Big Reds Friday night
(here) and Saturday night (at Ber
keley) is that the roof will fall on
them. In all probability, by the
time they leave the floor on the lat
ter night, they'll feel as though it
did.
Frankly, (his is (he Blue and
Gold's year on (lie court. In 17
games so far (his season they've
garnered 15 triumphs — against
some of the best cagers in (lie area.
The Cards have a slightly more
besplattered record, two wins in
eight starts. However, the locals
have not yet been., able to start any
two games with the same lineup.
So severe is the personal situation
on the Farm's Five, that Don Lie
bendorfer, B.A.C. publicity manager,
has shied away from issuing a team
roster to any of the local papers.
Wouldn't do any good, what with
men falling out for one reason or
another, and all newcomers still in
the category of the question mark.
One thing is certain for Friday
night, anyway. The Injuns are as
sured of a packed house, all tick
ets for the game here going before
5 o'clock last night. And they may
lie cheered on wi(h something
more than an occasional rooter
Saturday, if (he way the tickets
arc going is an indication of root
er strength.
A former Pre-Flight and Pacific
star, eagle-eyed Andy Wolfe, will
pace the Bears to what (th?y hope)
should be their third and fourth
conference wins. This boy Wolfe is
good. So good that Coach Everett
Dean may be forced to put two men
on him both nights.
Wolfe, who has played in all of
Cal's 15 victories, and was out when
it lost to Treasure Island's Armed
Guard and Utah, has flicked 207
points through the mesh, 23 of them
in last week's doubleheader with
U.C.L.A., to hold down fourth place
among the nation's scorers.
Putting two men on him may
dampen his scoring ardor, but that
always leaves another Bear on the
loose. And any one of the other in
vaders—Merv LaFaille, a returned
veteran and Wolfe's partner at for-

ward, center Jim Smith or guards
Bob Hogeboom or Jim Wray—on the
loose would run the Reds dizzy. It's
not easy, no matter how you look
at it.
The Bruins tried something of
the sort in their second game at
Berkeley, and seemed well 011
their way to victory until they fell
apart in the closing seconds of the
brawl. Actually, it was the final
20 seconds of the tilt, when sul>
Boh Anderson drove down the slot
for a layup, that gave Cal its 157-155
win.
If Stanford does as well Friday or
Saturday, you can count on the
Farm's season improving with age.—

eight starts. However, the locals
have not yet been., able to start any
two games with the same lineup.
So severe is the personal situation
on the Farm's Five, that Don Lie
bendorfer, B.A.C. publicity manager,
has shied away from issuing a team
roster to any of the local papers.
Wouldn't do any good, what with
men falling out for one reason or
another, and all newcomers still in
the category of the question mark.
One thing is certain for Friday
night, anyway. The Injuns are as
sured of a packed house, all tick
ets for the game here going before
5 o'clock last night. And they may
lie cheered on wi(h something
more than an occasional rooter
Saturday, if (he way the tickets
arc going is an indication of root
er strength.
A former Pre-Flight and Pacific
star, eagle-eyed Andy Wolfe, will
pace the Bears to what (th?y hope)
should be their third and fourth
conference wins. This boy Wolfe is
good. So good that Coach Everett
Dean may be forced to put two men
on him both nights.
Wolfe, who has played in all of
Cal's 15 victories, and was out when
it lost to Treasure Island's Armed
Guard and Utah, has flicked 207
points through the mesh, 23 of them
in last week's doubleheader with
U.C.L.A., to hold down fourth place
among the nation's scorers.
Putting two men on him may
dampen his scoring ardor, but that
always leaves another Bear on the
loose. And any one of the other in
vaders—Merv LaFaille, a returned
veteran and Wolfe's partner at for-

ward, center Jim Smith or guards
Bob Hogeboom or Jim Wray—on the
loose would run the Reds dizzy. It's
not easy, no matter how you look
at it.
The Bruins tried something of
the sort in their second game at
Berkeley, and seemed well 011
their way to victory until they fell
apart in the closing seconds of the
brawl. Actually, it was the final
20 seconds of the tilt, when sul>
Boh Anderson drove down the slot
for a layup, that gave Cal its 157-155
win.
If Stanford does as well Friday or
Saturday, you can count on the
Farm's season improving with age.—
Erwin Fackas.
From where we sit, about the only
thing that won't (or shouldn't) hap
pen to the Big Reds Friday night
(here) and Saturday night (at Ber
keley) is that the roof will fall on
them. In all probability, by the
time they leave the floor on the lat
ter night, they'll feel as though it
did.
Frankly, (his is (he Blue and
Gold's year on (lie court. In 17
games so far (his season they've
garnered 15 triumphs — against
some of the best cagers in (lie area.
The Cards have a slightly more
besplattered record, two wins in
eight starts. However, the locals
have not yet been., able to start any
two games with the same lineup.
