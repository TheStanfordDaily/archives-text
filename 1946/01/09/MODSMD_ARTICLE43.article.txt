to the National Collegiate Athletic-
Association convention tonight that

riod of their history because of "fi

Compton. leading those forces op
posing recruiting and employment
of athletes by colleges, was the prin
cipal speaker at the N.C.A.A. Coun

"This financial pressure to win
games has many a coach and college
executive straining his conscience in
employing athletes and urging stu
dents to devote to the game their
time and their primary interest that
should have been reserved for their
studies," he said.
"If the heavy demand for intercol
legiate games as sports spectacles in

are in earnest about education will
be compelled to stop the intercolle
giate games."
Compton said h" felt that such a
