NEW YORK, Jan. 8 (UP).—Tele
phone installation workers in 10
telephone exchanges, including Chi
cago, San Francisco, St. Louis,
Cleveland and Detroit, were called
on strike tomorrow morning by their
union president, Ernest Weaver, of
the Association of Communication
Equipment Workers.
Weaver said the strike had been
ordered in a conference telephone
call to union leaders tonight alter a
Western Electric Company contract
offer today was deemed unaccept
able.
He said, however, that he would
request management to continue ne
gotiations.
"If no agreement is reached in 24
hours—by Wednesday at 9:30 p.m.—
the union will refuse to compromise
further an original wage increase
demand of $6 weekly," he said.
He said New York workers would
not go out with the others at the
zero hour of 11 a.m. but "might go
out during the day."
He said Minneapolis also would go
out but declined to name the other
four cities included.
He said picket lines would not be
formed until Friday. The ACW's
parent body, the National Federation
of Telephone Workers, had pledged
itself not to cross any picket lines
established by the union.
