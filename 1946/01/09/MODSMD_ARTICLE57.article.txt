## 
### 
NUERNBERG, Jan. 8 (UP).—
Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering
was pictured to the international
military tribunal today as possibly
the real evil genius of Germany,
who carried out Adolf Hitler's
grandiose plans with smooth, ruth
less efficiency.
"In some respects," American
Prosecutor Ralph G. Albrecht,
New York and Washington law
yer, told the court, "Goering was
more dangerous than the fuehrer
himself."
Albrecht painted Goering as a
man whose fat, grinning face masked
a cruel, keen mind, ready at any
time to murder an enemy, tell a ri
bald joke or take Germany on an
other step toward war.
On the basis of official documents,
Albrecht charged that Goering es
tablished the dread Gestapo, set up
concentration camps, carried out
the 1934 blood purge, organized po
groms, took a leading part in the
seizure of Austria and Czechoslo
vakia and as economic dictator built
the war machine which all but con
quered the world.
After Albrecht completed the
case against Goering, British Pros
ecutor David Maxwell Fyfe start
ed outlining charges against For
eign Minister Joachim von Ilib
bentrop, citing how he as front
man in relations with other coun
tries schemed and deceived and
cheated even Germany's allies.
Unlike most Nazis Albrecht said,
Goering came of a good family and
had an ingratiating manner which
"all but concealed his steel vindict
iveness, cruelty and lust for self
glorification and power."
He told how, when Hitler at
tained power, Goering as Prussian
premier and interior minister used
the regular police to suppress anti-
Nazis. As president of the Reich
stag, he said, Goering forced through
measures which gave Hitler total
power. Goering, he said, established
the Gestapo in April, 1933, and then
set up the first concentration camps.
