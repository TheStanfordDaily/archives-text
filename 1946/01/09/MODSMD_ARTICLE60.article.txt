# Stanford Military Life Returns To Peace Basis; Resume ROTC
## 
### VIRGINIA SHULTZ 
A four - year Reserve Officers'
Training Corps program will be re
sumed at Stanford this quarter as
part of the new '"interim" military
training which will continue until a
permanent postwar program has
been planned by Congress, stated
Col. John R. Eden, professor of mili
tary science and tactics.
The training is divided into two
phases, a beginning course which is
similar to the basic training given to
soldiers, and an advanced part which
corresponds to the officer candidate
school which was started as part of
the war mobilization program.
The completion of the course
leads to an appointment as second
lieutenant in the Officers' Reserve
Corps. Through this program the
Army plans to expand the organi
zation and produce college-trained
junior reserve officers.
The basic phase of the program,
which has been offered during the
war, will continue as a Branch Im
material course. It meets three hours
weekly and carries two units of
credit. The object of the course is
to familiarize the student with the
fundamentals of military science
with an introduction to training
methods and leadership.
The three hours may be taken
successively in one afternoon or
staggered through several claj-s.
Some of the subjects include forma
tion?, dismounted and extended or
der crills, ceremonies, organization
of tne Army, map and graph read
ing, and rifle (mecnanical training).
AI Stanford the advanced course
comprises training in Field Artil
lery, Ordnance, and Quartermas
ter Corps units. The first year of
fers subjects common to all fields
while the final year offers special
ization in the chosen field. It car
ries three units of credit per quar
ter.
Military law and unit administra
tion are the main subjects taught in
two one-hour morning periods and
training management and command
and leadership are studied in three
one-hour afternoon sessions. Upon
graduation the student receives his
commission.
Colonel Eden emphasized that
all lower division students who
are physically qualified and with
out military service arc eligible
for the first year of the basic
course. It will be especially help
ful after induction during the
training in Army basic centers, he
commented.
Any student having two years of
hit;h school R.O.T.C. work or a vet
eran of six months' service may reg
ister for the second-year course.
To enroll in the advanced course
members must be between the ages

of 1C and 26, meet the physic.il
standards, obtain a minimum seme
of 110 on the Army General Classi
fication Test, and require at> leas;
two academic years to complete
graduation requirements. Veterans
with one year of service are also
eligible.
Only engineering students are eli
gible for the Ordnance unit, with
priorities given to those in Mechani -
cal Engineering. For the Quarter
master Corps men in the Graduate
Si.hool of Business are given prefer
ence, but the Field Artillery divi
sion is open to all students.
Advanced coursc enrollees will
receive approximately $370 during
the two-year course and between
$70 and $75 while attending a re
quired six-week summer camp
which normally falls between the
first and second year. At the camp
the program will center around
theoretical and practical instruc
tion in technique, tactics and lead
ership.
At Stanford the whole program is
elective, although at many state uni
versities the basic course is required.
The advanced phase will require
special equipment, such as a battery
of field artillery and guns and mo
tors which the Farm had in pre-wai
years, but at the beginning those
will not be needed, added Colonel
Eden.
The War Department has given
Stanford a tentative quota of 54 for
the advanced group, although this
may be increased or decreased do
pending upon the demand. Colonel
Eden expects the group to be rela
tively small at the beginning since
only veterans will be dble to meet
the requirements.
Formerly most of the enrollees
were selected from the basic
course, but since the Selective
Service has been inducting all 18-
vear-olds, war veterans will he the
only ones able to meet the re
quirements at the beginning. Also
over (10 per cent of the veterans on
campus have been commissioned
officers, but some may want to ob
tain a reserve commission in some
other unit than the one they have.
Consequently only about 10 per
cent will be eligible lor advanced
training, either because they already
are in the reserve or because they
are physically disabled, announced
Colonel Eden.
The R.O.T.C. program has been
set up under the National Defense
Act which was passed at the end

of the last war. Under legislation
last summer the special provisions
enabling veterans to receive com
missions in the reserve were en
acted.
Colonel Eden will be professor in
charge of the program. His assist
ants will be Maj. Eric E. Duckstad,
Capt. Robert Isaac, and Capt. Jack
C. Eisenschmidt.
Colonel Garrccht will replace
Colonel Eden as professor of mil
itary science and tactics when the
Infantry officer is transferred. Col
onel Eden, who has been com
mandant since the start of the
ASTP program in 1!)43, expects to
retire from the Army this year.
Since the first Army men stepped
on the Stanford campus in April
1943 for specialized training, the
University has had 11,928 military
students, Colonel Eden reported.
Height of the war-time program was
reached in autumn quarter, 1943,
with 2800 soldiers enrolled in ASTP,
in addition to officers enrolled in
the Civil Affairs Training School and
WACs studying in the Physical
Therapy School.
