WITH CHINESE TROOPS IN
MANCHURIA, Jan. 6 (Correct)
(UP). â€”The "Saar of Manchuria,"
rich coal belt lying between the Je
hol province cities of Pehpiao and
Fusin, has fallen to Gen. Tu Li-
Ming's Chinese Nationalist armies
in the past 48 hours, and the occu
pation of eastern Jehol province was
proceeding at a good pace today
despite bitter cold.
Chinese Communists, who spread
over Jehol alter the withdrawal of
the Soviet army which drove out the
Japanese, are falling back before
Gen. Tu's advance. More than 200
miles southwest of this sector,
Chengtch, the capital of Jehol, is
being squeezed by the advance of
Chungking's columns.
Possession of the rich, Japa
nese-developed coal belt was
clinched without a fight by the
occupation of Pehpiao, 20 miles
west of the Jehol-Liaoning bor
der, and Chaoyang, railway town
about 25 miles southwest of Peh
piao. Earlier in the week Gen.
Tu's forces took Fusin, some 50
miles northeast of Pchpaio.
Only an occasional potshot was
taken as the Nationalists entered
Fusin, villagers said through inter
preters.
Experts of the Chungking Cen
tral Government charged after in
spection that the Soviet armies re
moved most of the heavy equipment
and smaller items were carried of!
by the Chinese Communists.
General direction of Gen. Tu's
13th army advance into Jehol is
southward and westward. Far to
the southwest, the Chinese !)2nd
army from the Peiping area forms
the other arm of the pincers clos
ing on Changteh, Jehol province
capital.
Gen. Tu entered Fusin on his spe
cial train carrying a guard of sev
eral hundred soldiers and preceded
by an armored car. We passed over
two temporary bridges built hastily
alongside the regular rail bridges
which Communists reportedly de
stroyed. Tu's train carried mine
experts to examine the Fusin-Peh
piao area.
