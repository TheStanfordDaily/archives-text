the Philippines behind their aims.
Sgt. Harold SchifYrin, Itochcslcr,
N.Y., chairman of a giant soldier
protest rally here Monday night
and chairman of a five-man com
mittee representing more than
20,000 soldiers in the Philippines,
said his committee was scheduled

At that time, he said, they hope to

plans for future action.
"We are gratified by the immedi
ate response of our Congressmen to
our protest against confused demo
bilization policies," said SchifTrin.
Monday night's rally gave the
committee the go-ahead on three
topics, he explained.
First was to send cablegrams to
Congressmen; second, to invite
Secretary of War Robert Patterson
and members of a Congressional
subcommittee of the War Investi
gating Committee to meet with
soldiers' representatives at Manila,
and third, to form a committee
representing as many Army out
fits in the Philippines as possible.

1 WASHINGTON, Jan. b (UP), in
an implied rebuke to servicemen
demonstrating against slow demo
i bilization, President Truman assert
, ed today that the Army and Navy
I are releasing men as speedily as
j possible in the face of critical ovcr-
I seas needo.
He strongly defended the demo
j bilization program in a 500 - word
statement which reminded impatient
I G.l.'s, sailors and Marines that this
j nation must do its part in maintain
ing world peace. Consequently,
j thousands of them must continue to
i serve in armies of occupation and
perform other indispensable duties
until replacements are available.
"To satisfy myself that demobili
zation is being carried out with all
possible speed," Mr. Truman said, "I
have reviewed once more the Army
and Navy procedures. 1 am con
i vinced, as every other American
who examines the record must be,
I that the services are carrying out
j demobilization with commendable
: efficiency and with justice to all con
cerned."
He gave two reasons why every
I member of the armed forces cannot
be discharged promptly:
1. The enormous size of the task
involved.
2. The fact thai "our nation
, must assume its full share of re
! sponsihility for keeping the peace
! and destroying the war-making
potential of the hostile nations that
were bent on keeping the world in
a state of warfare."
