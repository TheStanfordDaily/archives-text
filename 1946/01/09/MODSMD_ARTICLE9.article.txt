Stanford veterans — attended last
night's meeting of the American
Veterans' Committee at the Palo
Alio Community Center, according
(o chairman pro tempore Eugene

veterans' bonuses, parades and spe
cial treatment were brushed aside
by speakers at the meeting who pro
fessed a genuine desire 1o join the
Palo Alto chapter and operate a
committee of genuine service to the
nat ion.
Burdick, reappointed as pro
tempore chairman, explained the
A.V.C.'s objectives and organization
at the meeting, after which ques
tions were asked and speakers rose
from the audience to express their
support.
"The feeling- an active, enthusi
astic one seemed to be that we are
citizens first, and veterans secondly.
Everyone wanted to have a hand in
making America more prosperous,
more democratic, and more secure.
They felt," he continued, "that by
improving conditions for all Ameri
cans. the veteran will automatically
receive benefit from his efforts."
A second meeting of the Commit
tee will bi held Wednesday, January
23. The place will be announced
later, since the Community Center
would be too small for the indicated
mem bership.
