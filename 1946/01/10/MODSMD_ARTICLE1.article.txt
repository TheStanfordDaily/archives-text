Cal-Farm Debate
Nine society members have start
ed training for the JofTre Debate,
held annually in May between the
University of California and Stan
ford.
This contest has been held yearly
since 1895 on a question of French
politics. In spite of its rather tech
nical subject, the JofTre has devel
oped into one of the outstanding
debates in the country, performed
every year before a large audience.
Aims for High Level
The JofTre aims for a high level of
speaking by discouraging memoriz
ing and "canned debates." Partici
pants are not given the specific
question until an hour before the
contest.
They do, however, know the
general field from which the ques
tion is drawn some months in ad
vance. Tryoutees spend winter and
spring quarters studying every
phase of French life. The three best
are selected for the actual debate.
Nine in Training
Society members training now are
Carol Newton, Don Germain, Wynn
Dahlgren, Rod Rogaway, Jim Kess
lei, Art JafTe, Bob Vallier, Ward
Hower, and Frank Creede.
Kessler and Vallier are veteran
Stanford debaters, returning this
quarter after a war-time absence.
Miss Newton and Germain are old
Society members.
