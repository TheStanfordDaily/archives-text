Howard. Encina sponsor, and j
administrator of the Spring Sings,
was appointed in his status as a
veteran who formerly attended
Stanford, and will begin,an ex
tensive program of education on
Honor Code principles for new
students, the bulk of whom are
veterans. Miss Irwin served as i
chairman autumn and winter
quarters last year.
Jane Sontheimer is a new mem- j
ber of Women's Council, according j
to Excom's vote, replacing Joan
Fullinwider who graduated autumn
quarter. Miss Sontheimer was se
lected in part as a representative of
Row units, an area until now not ;
represented on Council.
The "Scalp Song," written by
ASCAP song-writer Irving Babo
especially for Stanford, was heard
by Excm on a recording, and ap
proved for publication. Half the
publishing price and all the roy
alties go to the A.S.S.U., accord
ing to the agreement advocated
by Mr: Babo.
Tickets to Bob Hope's broadcast
Tuesday will go primarily to vet

erans and in-service students, at
the request of Hope, who tradition
ally performs for service audiences.
Speech and drama majors may re
ceive any extra tickets, according
to Kennedy, but other civilian stu
dents will be excluded.
Election for Women's Council
members, head yell leader, and
vice-chairman of Women's Con
ference to serve spring quarter
will be held during the third week
of February, at which time the
A.S.S.U. constitution, now oper
ating on a trial basis, will be vot
ed upon. The simultaneous elec
tion is to insure a representative
vote on the latter question.
Salaries of the Concert Series
manager and her assistants were
raised from $50 and $10 respective
ly to $75 and $20 respectively for
each concert.
A student-faculty committee ap
pointed last quarter, to assist in the
administration of funds collected in
Dimes for Diplomas drives for
scholarships to returning Stanford
veterans, was abolished. It was
found that the University Scholar
ship Committee had adequate fa
cilities for distributing this money
to veterans who applied.
An all-new students assembly
to acquaint them with Stanford
history and traditions was sug
gested and will l>e referred to the
Committee on Public Exercises.
