unable to attend. Kennedy stressed
that the auditorium will be well po
liced, and crashing will be impos
sible. Said Kennedy, '"It's a big
| thing for Stanford to have Bob
| Hope, so we have to do it as he

j and listen to their radiosâ€”that's
j what Mr. Hope has requested."

an opportunity of observing the
production and broadcasting of a
