# Excom OK's Atomic Group
## 
### 
The Student Association for Atomic Control was unanimously rccog
j nized by Executive Committee last night as an independent, unchartered
j organization.
The aims of the organization arc stated in the preamble to its consti
; tution:
"We, the members of the 'Student Association for Atomic Control,'

" realizing the grave significance of
the atomic bomb and recognizing
the imperative need for prompt,
concerted action for control of
atomic energy, do hereby resolve
to speed the organization of an
international atomic control com
mission in every possible way, es
pecially by mobilizing public ac
tion.
"It is our firm conviction that thi
most effective means for controlling
atomic energy is through the estab
lishment of an international com
mission entrusted with the control
of atomic weapons and their manu
facture, with the authority to carry
out whatever inspections are neces
sary to regulate the use of atomic
energy, and with the powers and
means to take any action to pre
serve the peace."
The group will meet at 7:.'!<) p.m.
today in room E-7 of the Ed
ucation Building to outline its
work for the quarter and to elect
officers. All students interested in
the problems of atomic control are
invited to attend, according to
Charles Clark, provisional presi
dent.
S.A.A.C. was informally organ
ized last November following an
all-campus forum on the atomic
bomb. After the forum, twelve stu
dents met to formulate the funda
mentals of the association.
In ensuing weeks the group
grew rapidly, although it was not
able to hold public meetings,
pending Excom approval. An in
formal meeting shortly before the
close of winter quarter was at
tended by forty students.
The association's constitution, ap
proved by Excom yesterday, was
drafted by a committee of five stu
dents who remained on campus
during Christmas vacation, and was
unanimously upheld by the group
Monday.
Included in the Constitutional
Committee were, besides Clark,
Louise Patterson, graduate phys
ics student, Camilla Ryall, Vir
ginia Voegcli, and George Brunn.
Throughout the formation of the
organization Seville Chapman, pro
fessor of physics, was consulted.
Immediate plans of the associa
tion include the organizaiton of
campus debates and forums and
of a speakers' service—in co-op
eration with the Stanford Speak
ers' Bureau—whose members will
discuss the aspects of atomic con
trol before Bay Area civic groups.
The association will co-ordinate
its work with groups in other col
leges pursuing similar aims.
