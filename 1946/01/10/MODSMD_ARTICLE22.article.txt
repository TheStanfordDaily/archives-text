# Come Join the Band
## 
### 
Want a free trip to Pasadena along toward
Jan. 1, 1947? Would you like to toot a trumpet
and march in the parade for the i'ournament of
RqsGo? If so, join the Stanford Band NOW!
Seriously, though, we're quite sure that by
the time Stanford gets that Rose Bowl bid, there
V/ill be instrument players aplenty who will be
eager to get in on the Southern California
New Year's Day fun. But it's a little musical
support for Stanford's basketball bouts with Cal
thii; weekend that we're worried about.
According to University Organist Warren D.
Allen, only nine (9) students out of 4,391 now
registered for winter quarter have signed up
for Music 4 (Band, to you). At least 18 more are
needed to keep the class going and, inciden
tally, to field a band.
We owe to our late-departed ASTP men
thanks for keeping the band from doing a com
plete disappearing act during the war. So now
that we're flooded with more civilian men (and
women) than Stanford has seen in many a long
day, we really ought to be able to produce a
band that's at least as good as our war-time
version.
And speaking from the rooter's standpoint, we
do like a little music to drown out our raucous
voice'; as we join in for the Farm fight songs.
So you can play a musical instrument, sign
up fc; Band now. We need you. â€”M.S.
