### STANLEY WILSON 
Soma people call them Buzz Boys. Some peo
ple call them Airedales. And other people call
them olh&r things. But no matter what you call
them, or if they don't wear flight jackets or
miniature wings under their discharge buttons,
you will always be able to recognize one of
those boys from the Wild-you-know-what.
Just take notice while walking down Quad
some day and it won't take long to spot one.
You'll see one of these former poor man's Hot
Hiot Charlie's flying low with his girlfriend act
ing as his co-pilot. One of his hands will be fol
lowing the other simulating power dives, snap
rolls, slow rolls, easy rolls, hard rolls and once
over-easies. Then you'll know he's the garden
variety of a Hot Rock, right off the flight line.
On a 35 cent personally conducted tour of
Dinah's the other evening I spotted not one,
two, or three of these Hell-for-Cockpit boys, but
a whole formation. All were grouped around a
guy whom I suppose was their flight command
er. And they were using their beer bottles as
a thing referred to as the "stick." I didn't ex
actly understand what was going on, but I sup
pose they were being "briefed." This comes
before the attack they told me. But as yet I
don't know what they were going to attack, but
I have my ideas.
Here are some snatches of the conversation
which I overheard: "I came in at 20,000 feet,
rolled over on my back and kicked it into a 85
degree dive" . . . "How was I to know I had
run out of gas twenty miles from my nest?"
. . . "We went in about 10 feet off the ground
and each plane was about three feet in back of
the other" . . . And then a former Army boy

said: "I don't know why the Navy insisted on
flying Hellcats when there were plenty of P-51's
hanging around." I don't know why, but this
last statement caused a good deal of argument
and soon the "sticks" looked more like clubs
and the former flyers looked more like Japa
nese Judo instructors. At any rate, Mac tells me
that Dinah's will be open for sure by Friday
night.
Now this is all fine and good, but I wonder
what chance a poor infantry man has to show
his girlfriend how he won the war. He couldn't
very well take her out behind the campus, get
up to his knees in thick mud and demonstrate
the art of self-defense in a fox-hole. I don't
think she would think it very romantic.
And then there is always the former Navy
group. But their day will come in Spring quar
ter. Then they will be able to move to Lake
Lagunita, launch a task force of canoes, throw
up a mud-ball pre-invasion bombardment, and
show us all how they landed on Whatchama
calla Island. That will be the day.
But I definitely have decided that next time
it's the air corps for me. At present I feel like
an introvertâ€”-a social outcast. I don't know a
thing about revving up a motor, the intricacies
of the oil pressure or manifold gauges. I just
can't talk with the fellas anymore. I guess the
best thing for me to do is to learn how to make
with the hands like they do and learn hand
flying. Then I too can do power dives, slow
rolls, snap rolls, hard rolls and with enough
practice, perhaps, once-over-easies.
