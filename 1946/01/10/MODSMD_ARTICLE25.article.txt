### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Today's news is built around strikes. The
hopes of rapid reconversion, of industrial peace,
and of smooth economic sailing are at least tot
tering due to contemporary troubles.
Automobiles, housing, steel, and other vital
commodities are stopped at industrial concep
tion. Now, telephone and telegraph service at
important exchanges is threatened. Everybody
is suffering.
Industrial disputes must today be settled not
only fairly but peacefully. Yet, despite what is
said, the major remedy in most industries is
the strike. This is as efficient and eguitable as a
gun would be in deciding a law suit.
STRIKES
A strike can paralyze a whole industry over a
dispute involving a small part of it. A number
of strikes can set back a whole country.
Yet, in spite of these facts, industry demands
the "sovereign prerogatives of free enterprise,"
and labor calls for "the right to strike." But, on
the streets, the people say that "If this govern
ment doesn't do something about the situation,
we'll elect one that will."
ARBITRATION
It is not the job of Congress to consider class
interests or group interests, but the needs of the
people as a whole. One of those needs is in
creased production, and strikes are a curb to
it. Something much more satisfactory to labor,
to industry, and to everybody else is needed.
With the strike picture darkening, that must be
some sort of fair arbitration that can serve as a
substitute for strikes.
Most arbitration plans call for the government
to appoint either all or â€”else one of the arbi
ters. This is a proposition with serious draw
backs," which all sides are rightly objecting to.
It means that the government can control the
distribution of wages and profits. It is state en
croachment, which the founders of the Republic
did everything to guard against.
A better and more useful method exists in
many labor contracts today. It is that labor and
industry appoint an arbiter each, and the two
select a third arbiter, who is controlling.
If legislation were to be passed simply forc
ing all industrial disputes to be settled in this
way, two problems might be encountered,
though first of all, the first two could deadlock
on the third arbiter, and, secondly, with no
strike possible, industry could forestall discus
sions forever, thus gaining its point by filibuster.
But clauses in the legisiation might avert
these pitfalls. If, after thirty days, no arbiter
was appointed, the government could appoint
all three. These arbiters would have the duty
to publish all union records and business re
ports. Considering the furor now about fact
finding panels with these powers, all sides
might fall over backwards to get the third ar
biter guickly.
These boards, meeting secretly if privately
controlled, should have the right to subpoena
anything on the reguest of one of the three
members. That way all facts would be brought
up, but nothing too delicate to be published
would be released. At the end of sixty days
any one arbiter could force a vote on the deci
sion of the panel with two out of three con
trolling. The arbiters in fairness would not do
this unless there was a sign that industry was
purposely stalling. The decision, of course,
would bind everybody with civil and or crim
inal action applicable to any persisting dis
senter.
As a solution, this might have objectionable
points, but it is at least bettor than nothing.
