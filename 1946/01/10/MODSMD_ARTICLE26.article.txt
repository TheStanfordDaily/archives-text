## 
### JOANNE O'BRIEN 
The first of four visiting chap
lains that Stanf^'-' 1 TT,,i i«
to have between Jan. 3 and May 15
is Obert C. Tanner, who will re
main here from Jan. 3 to Jan. 16.
Mr. Tanner and Stanford Univer
sity are not strangers. He has had
many and varied contacts with the
University—as a graduate student,
as an instructor in religion, and as
former acting chaplain.
Mr. Tanner did his undergraduate
work at the University of Utah. He
was ordained to the ministry at the
age of 19. After three years abroad
as a missionary, he spent several
years teaching and writing on Bible
literature. He has written two texts
on the New Testament, one, "The
New Testament Speaks," a popular
textbook used in many high schools
and junior colleges, and the other,
"New Testament Studies," a New
Testament commentary.
Character Texts
Mr. Tanner has also written two
texts in the field of character edu
cation. His "Problems of Youth"
and "Looking in on Greatness" pio
neered with Dr. Bower of the Uni
versity of Chicago the use of the
case method in character education,
now adopted in the public schools
of several states.
He studied with Dr. Goodspeed
and other members on the stafi' of
the University of Chicago Divinity
School. As a side interest, he com
pleted a law course, and, after tak
ing his LL.B. at the University of
Utah, he came to Stanford to study
philosophy, taking his M.A. here in
1936. The following year he studied
philosophy at Harvard and returned
to Stanford for an additional year
of work.
Acting Chaplain
He joined the staff here as an in
structor in religion, and served as
acting chaplain last winter quarter.
Mr. Tanner says his hobby is
travel and he has visited many for
eign countries, spending some time
in those lands connected with Bible
history. On second thought he added
that his hobby was probably not

travel but four red-headed chil
dren. whose ages are as neat as the
first page in an arithmetic book—
3, 5, 7, and 9.
Interest in Chapel
Mr. Tanner's special interest in
the Memorial Church at Stanford
has been to find the common ele
ments in religion on which the stu
dents with all shades of religious
belief could agree and feel equally
at home.
The topic for his sermon next
Sunday is "The Motives That Guide
Us."
On completing his short stay here
he will travel to Harvard to con
tinue his studies on philosophy.

main here from Jan. 3 to Jan. 16.
Mr. Tanner and Stanford Univer
sity are not strangers. He has had
many and varied contacts with the
University—as a graduate student,
as an instructor in religion, and as
former acting chaplain.
Mr. Tanner did his undergraduate
work at the University of Utah. He
was ordained to the ministry at the
age of 19. After three years abroad
as a missionary, he spent several
years teaching and writing on Bible
literature. He has written two texts
on the New Testament, one, "The
New Testament Speaks," a popular
textbook used in many high schools
and junior colleges, and the other,
"New Testament Studies," a New
Testament commentary.
Character Texts
Mr. Tanner has also written two
texts in the field of character edu
cation. His "Problems of Youth"
and "Looking in on Greatness" pio
neered with Dr. Bower of the Uni
versity of Chicago the use of the
case method in character education,
now adopted in the public schools
of several states.
He studied with Dr. Goodspeed
and other members on the stafi' of
the University of Chicago Divinity
School. As a side interest, he com
pleted a law course, and, after tak
ing his LL.B. at the University of
Utah, he came to Stanford to study
philosophy, taking his M.A. here in
1936. The following year he studied
philosophy at Harvard and returned
to Stanford for an additional year
of work.
Acting Chaplain
He joined the staff here as an in
structor in religion, and served as
acting chaplain last winter quarter.
Mr. Tanner says his hobby is
travel and he has visited many for
eign countries, spending some time
in those lands connected with Bible
history. On second thought he added
that his hobby was probably not

travel but four red-headed chil
dren. whose ages are as neat as the
first page in an arithmetic book—
3, 5, 7, and 9.
Interest in Chapel
Mr. Tanner's special interest in
the Memorial Church at Stanford
has been to find the common ele
ments in religion on which the stu
dents with all shades of religious
belief could agree and feel equally
at home.
The topic for his sermon next
Sunday is "The Motives That Guide
Us."
On completing his short stay here
he will travel to Harvard to con
tinue his studies on philosophy.

lains that Stanf^'-' 1 TT,,i i«
