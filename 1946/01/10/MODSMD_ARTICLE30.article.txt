Anyone interested in submitting
original one-act plays to Rani's
Head for the dramatic society's an
nual production of, One-Acts is
urged to do so, according to Murray
Stirton, one of the directors.
Noon on January 16 has been set
as the deadline for turning in these
plays to Carl Data at the Dramatic
Manager's office in the Student Un
ion. The three best plays submit
ted will be presented at Ram's Head
One-Acts, to be given on February
15 and 16 in the Little Theater.
Anyone interested in trying out
for technical work in make-up, cos
tumes, set construction, or lights
should see Marie Jo McGervey,
technical director of the produc
tion. Points toward membership in
Ram's Head will be given for tech
nical work, and those doing this
type of work will receive more
points than those who act in the
productions.
