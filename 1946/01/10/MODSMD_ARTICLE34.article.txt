For the benefit of those who were
not around the campus last quarter,
and also for the benefit of those that
have short memories, I'd like to
peek on the Underwood for a little
while on the rampagings of the
gridiron squad that was turned out
by Marchie Schwartz during the
fall quarter.
First things first. That's our slo
gan. So here's a chronological de
velopment of the Big Red Machine.
Spring quarter: Campaign by Daily
to resume intercollegiate football in
(he fall. Committee of students and
faculty gave thumbs down sign on
proposal.
Summer term: Marchie Schwartz
signed contract to return to Stan
ford when football was resumed.
War ended. (Incidental informa
tion. Barney Gugel pitched a no
hit softball game against a Toyon
team.)
Coach Schwartz Returns
Autumn quarter: Daily campaign
to have some sort of grid squad,
even if there would only be a
few informal scrimmages. Marchie
Schwartz treks west from his Mid-
Western oil company position. Foot
ball practice was announced. Coach
Schwartz, grid great at Notre Dame
a dozen years ago, was greeted by
more than 100 grid aspirants.
There were no experienced col
legiate players in the crowd, but op
timism drowned out (he predomi
nant greenness of the squad, and
more exuberant members of the
Farm family wanted the team to
hook up with California in a Big
Game. More sober thought pre
vailed among the B.A.C. hierarchy
and two engagements were lined
up. One against the Stockton Com
mandos, and another against the

San Mateo Merchant Marine Acad- :
emy.
Oiilicuit Conditions
Coach Schwartz operated under j
ihe most difficult coaching condi- 1
tions. First, he didn't have his reg- 1
ular coaching staff to help him. j
Second, practice was limited to an j
hour a day on account of labs. I
Third, he wasn't acquainted with !
any of the players. But despite
these "annoyances," Coach Marchie !
Schwartz whipped a team into play
ing condition in three weeks, and
we played host to Ihe potent sol
diers from the Stockton Army Air
Base. Led by Bob Krieger, former ;
collegiate star at Dartmouth, and j
later a pro with Philadelphia
Eagles, the boys on the Farm went
down to defeat.
Showing up well for Stanford in j
this initial football tilt in three j
years were Curt Burks at the quar- j
terback post, Fred Willey at lull- j
back, Gene Martin at right half, Bob I
Abrams at center, and Ric Supple
at end, who also served as team j
captain for the game.
Wins !!nd 'lilt
Taking a couple of days off to fill \
up on turkey over the Thanksgiv- j
ing vacation, the boys came back j
two weeks later to take on the Em- i
ory S. Land sponsored Merchant
Marine crew from San Mateo. We
fared much better in this contest, J
and by the time the final gun j
sounded, Stanford was ahead. That
game closed our brief gridiron es- j
capades. Everybody was happy, j
Students saw some football games !
in the football saucer on the cam- J
pus. Marchie Schwartz was able to j
look over his gridiron charges, and
saw what prospects he had for next ,
season.
Next fall we will return to a full
schedule in the Pacific Coast Con
ference. The round-robin schedule
was dropped, and we will not play j
Oregon and Montana. We will run
into all other teams, though, and
that includes Idaho, Washington,
W.S.C.. 0.5.C., Cal, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A.
Besides those conference games,
we will also play the University of
San Francisco, which is embarking
on a bigtime grid career. They have
hired "Clipper" Smith to handle j
their team. We also play Santa
Clara, long rivals on our list. That
team will be coached by Larry
"Moon" Mullins, who was a team
mate with Marchie Schwartz at No- i
tre Dame in the infant '30's.â€”Adios.
