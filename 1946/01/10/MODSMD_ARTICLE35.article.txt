# Museum Director To Speak on Art
## 
### 
Dr. Grace L. McCann Morley, di
rector of the San Francisco Museum
of Art, will lecture on Latin-Ameri
can art tonight at 7:30 in Cubberley
Auditorium. The lecture is being
given in conjunction with the ex
hibit of Latin-American art now on
display at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Most of the pictures in the ex
hibit were loaned by the San Fran
cisco Museum of Art. The material
was selected by Dr. Morley, who has
acquired a valuable collection of
Latin-American paintings for that
museum.
Dr. Morley has traveled widely in
Mexico, Central and South Amer
ica, and Europe, and contemporary
Latin-American art is one of her
specialties. She has done research
in archaeology and contemporary
art of these countries.
