# Phone Lines Paralyzed
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. !) (UP).—Al
most 8,000 indispensable technical
workers abandoned their jobs in
775 telephone exchanges from coast
to coast today and placed the nation
on the brink of a telephone commu
nications paralysis affecting every
city and town in 44 of the 48 states.
The deadline was 7 a.m. (local
time) Friday. Unless their wage
demands against Western Electric
Company, manufacturing and tech
nical affiliate of American Tele
phone and Telegraph, are met by
then they were pledged to picket
the exchanges in the key cities and
towns of the national telephone sys
tem.
Beginning at 8 a.m. (local time)
today, the obscure indispensables
of whom the public never hears,
walked out of the exchanges—a
score or more from big city ex
changes and so on down to the ex
changes so small they need only
one. By 2 p.m., all 6,000 were on
strike, awaiting word from their
union negotiators who were locked
in conference with company officials
here. Neither side expressed op
timism in regard to a settlement be
fore Friday that would avert the
vie-up.
The company said cables from
American soldiers abroad to their
families in the United States were
piling up in its cable office because
non-striking members of the strik
ing union, the American Communi
cations Association, CIO, had bro
ken their pledge to move them.
