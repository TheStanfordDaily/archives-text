WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP).—
Hopes of averting a nationwide steel
strike Monday were revived today
when the United Steel Workers
(CIO) and the U. S. Steel Corpora
tion agreed to resume collective bar
gaining negotiations at 2 p.m., EST.,
tomorrow.
The decision was announced by
Chairman Nathan P. Feinsinger of
President Truman's steel fact-find
ing panel. He released a statement,
saying the board is "ready to do ev
erything possible to facilitate the
final settlement of this dispute
through collective bargaining."
Factors behind the agreement were
not immedately revealed but it has
been reported the government will
grant the corporation a steel price
ceiling increase of $4 to $5 a ton.
This presumably would cover part
of the union's $2 a day wage increase
demand.
