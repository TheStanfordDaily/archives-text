# Cards Face 'Hot' Bears
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean's basketball
hopefuls are preparing themselves
for the invasion of California on
Friday night. The following night
the Farm easaba boys take to the
road, and hop over to Berkeley to
engage the Golden Bears on their
basketball court.
Never have the fortunes of the
Cardinal hoopsters been so low as
this season. Utah downed the nov
ice Stanford squad, 53-15, in one
of the worst shellackings an L.S.-
•J.U squad has ever taken. The
next night in the Reno open tour
nament — strictly basketball — the
University of Nevada dumped our
| squad to the tune of 47-30.
Defeated by U.S.C.
Last week-end in Los Angeles the
i L'.S.C. basketeers handed our men
I a set of defeats, but even in loss, the
Cards didn't look too bad. In fact,
| most people were surprised by their
j pood showing, especially Saturday
j bight.
I Not possessing one highly sea
soned member of the basketball
team, Coach Dean has had to start
from scratch. Not that lack of ex
perience wasn't bad enough, but
several of the key men have had to
j stand on the sidelines on account
|of injuries. First man to go under
was Tod Rodman, who reinjured his
j leg. Another starter has fallen by
the wayside via the injury route.
! He is "Chris" Christianson, clever
i guard of the Big Red basketball
quintet. Still another previous
I starter went out because of seho
| lastic difficulties.
No starting lineup has been an
nounced by Coach Dean, so a little
j speculation is forthcoming on our
part. Jim Hill, second in the con
i fcrence in scoring, will undoubtedly
' get the starting nod.
