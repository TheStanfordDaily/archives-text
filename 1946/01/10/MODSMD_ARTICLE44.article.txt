By KEN ROTENBERC,
We have just waded through a
stack of records so that we could
refresh your memories of Stanford
basketball, '42 style. You won't be
too surprised, we hope, to learn
that the hardwood and hoop boys
of that ancient era breezed through
the N.C.A.A. tournament to beat
Dartmouth in the finals, thereby
becoming the National Collegiate
champions. The flashy Jimmy Pol
lard scored a neat 26 points in that
"chips-down" game and Howie
Delmar, hands down, won most val
uable man honors on his team. How
did the Indians come to play in this
tournament? It was this way.
The squad got ofT to a fast start,
whipping U.S.C., California, and

U.C.L.A. They scored 103 points in
the last two of these contests. Then
on a "cold" night they dropped one
to U.S.C. 43-30. They hung onto the
P.C.C. lead by winning a couple of
more rounds. On? of these was a
thrilling double overtime affair with
the California Bears. Score: Stan
ford 43, Cal 39.
The Injuns then broke camp and
went down L.A. way. Hunting was
a bit easier. They collected two
wins in succession, dumping U.C.-
L.A. 42-30 and then 36-28. In the
stretch, with only four games left
to play, our boys had a rather tight
stranglehold on the Pacific Coast
Conference title, and were so
pleased with this situation they
never did let go.
Won P.C.C. Flag
The whirlwind five won the next
few —the victory over U.S.C. clinch
ing the southern division flag, and
taking Oregon's scalp made them
tops to the north tip of Alaska, I
ljuess.
In the N.C.A.A. battle. Stanford
took on and set down fine teams
from Rice and Colorado, before giv
ing Dartmouth their lesson.
Howie Delmar, who was known
back in them thar days as the "new
Hank," was high scorer for the
I team, and was picked along with
j Cowden for the All-Tournament

t<?am. Co-captain Don Burness was
the defensive rock who spent his
time glueing himself to opposing
stars, never letting them turn on the
razzle-dazzle. He was also the vet
eran and chief steadying influence
on his more inexperienced team
mates. and was known as Ma to the
boys for these "good guy" activities.
"Tip-in" Man
Last, but not the dimmest light
of the '42 gang, is Ed Voss. He was
the inevitable six and one-hall' foot
er and made the tip-ins like mad.
Well, that's the way it was in the
i pre-war era. We're all hoping that
our current crop of athletes produce
j some of the thrills these fellows did.
