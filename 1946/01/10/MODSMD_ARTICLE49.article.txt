# Demobilizing to Speed Up
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP).â€”
The War Department revealed to
night that it is reviewing the entire
I demobilization situation and that
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, chief of
j staff, again has ordered all unneeded
, men returned to the United States
without delay.
It said its detailed future demo
, fcilization program will be forthcom
| ing shortly.
The disclosure came as GI demon
j strations against demobilization de
lays spread around the world. There
j also were new demands for a con
j gressional investigation.
The announcement, apparently de
signed to meet GI protests and quiet
j criticism, came a few hours after
Eisenhower told President Truman
J that the Army must not be permit
j ted to demobilize at a rate that would
j cut its strength below minimum
needs.
Eisenhower, in his order to all ma
| jor overseas commanders, instructed
! them anew to cut their manpower
requirements to the minimum.
