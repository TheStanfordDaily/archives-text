CHUNGKING, Jan. 9 (UP). -
Gen. George C. Marshall's peace
commission failed to reach agree
ment as expected today on cease
fire orders for China's civil war and
there were reports that the govern
ment's swift campaign to overtake
Jehol province in the north was the
main stumbling block.
ll appeared that the People's Con
sultative Council will open tomor
row with the unsettled civil war
hanging over the heads of the dele
gates and clouding efforts to reach
agreement on the unification and
reconstruction of China.
Marshall and his two conferees,
government representative Chang
Chun and Communist representa
tive General Chou En-lai, closed
their fourth meeting without hope
of issuing an immediate cease-fire
order. Chang told the press that

"prospects were not bad but difii
cult."
Th«? well - informed newspaper
Sinminpao said the main problem
at the fourth meeting was govern
ment insistence on pressing the Je
hol province campaign until Na
tionalist troops occupy both the
provincial capital of Changtch and
the second city of Chihfeng. Com
munists insist that Nationalist
troops halt where they are when
the cease-fire order is issued.
Two columns of General Tu Li
ming's troops are driving for the
cities, according to the latest re
ports from the front, and now are
about 60 miles from each with pros
pects of reaching them wiihin the
next few days.
