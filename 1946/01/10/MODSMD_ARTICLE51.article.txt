"REACH RED" by Peter Bowman;
Random House; $2.50
After World War I, attempts to
picture war in words became fash
ionable. The "lost generation" tried
to tell what it had been through,
what it thought of the present and
hoped for the future.
War and Peace
The attempt failed. That is, it
could not transmit the reality ' of
front-line existence to civilians; or,
at any rate, not to enough of them
to matter.
Nevertheless, some outstanding
writing was produced. "Three Sol
diers" and "All Quiet on the West
ern Front" are already classics of
modern literature. They are art in
'.hat they abstract the essence from
reality and do this in a way that is
warm and human, not coldly ana
lytical.
No Lost Generation
As yet World War II has not
brought about a lost generation. At
least not in America. This is un
loubtedly largely due to the fact
that the American soldier of 1941
had far fewer illusions and hopes
than the doughfeet of 1917. "Fight
ing to get home" has replaced
"fighting to make the world safe
lor democracy."
Again there are men, men with
watchful eyes, observant minds,
and aching hearts who desire to
clarify, to explain, to bridge with
words the gap between two
worlds. Hill Mauldin, in his car
toons and writing, is the most out
standing and successful example
of this.
A rt i filial
Peter Bowman is another. Many
are yet to come. If I may look at
his "Beach Red"' for a moment not
"3s a literary critic but as an ex
infantryman, I would .say that it
doesn't ring true.
Bowman expands an hour in the
life and death of a soldier—he calls
him "you"—who participates in an
amphibious landing, goes out on pa
trol, and gets killed, into two hours
of reading. He arranges his work
as blank verse, but states specifi
cally that it is intended as prose.
The result is a confusing mixture
of both.
Lyricism and the GI
"Howitzer projectiles arch grace
fully like a chorus girl's eilded

, heel." "The engines roar in the
I opening bars of a symphony and a
scream of trumpets leaps from the
feverish hull."
No GI lias the time or mood to
make these poetic (?) observa
tions. lie is concerned with far
more elementary things. He is
likely not (o think at all. In a
foxhole you don't analyze; you
live on instinct.
Poetry in Foxholes?
In a foxhole there is no time for
j cute ideas like "Patriotism means
| allowing the other fellow to die for
his country" or ' Battle doesn't de
j termine.who is right. Only who is
j left."
No soldier a few yards away from
| a Jap thinks as Bowman would have
|us believe: "Little brown brother,
we are about to separate you from
i your place in the sun. The spirit of
Bushido has been spoken of from
)lden times in these words: 'Among
I flowers the cherry, among men the
| warrior.' We do not suppose that
i death will change your point of
| view, but it will efficiently end it.
j. . .
j Correspondent or Soldier?
j A war correspondent, comfor
i tably settled and far from the hat
tie, might think like that; his
thought might even he inter
spersed with Bible quotations like
Bowman's, but to a guy lying in
the bushes on patrol, with Japs all
around him, Bible quotes and the
theory of Bushido are about the
last things that would enter his
mind.
, As a result you get an imagina
j 'ive correspondent's story, accurate
| in the externals, and full of inter
! osting vocabulary and clever re
marks. But if you are trying to un
derstand the feelings and thoughts
?nd experiences of a soldier in bat
ik;, "Beach Red" is not the book for
I you.—George Brunn
