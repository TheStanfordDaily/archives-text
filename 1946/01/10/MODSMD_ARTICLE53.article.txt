### GEORGE ECKSTEIN LARRY FRANKLEY 
MUSICAL NOTES
Duke Ellington landed in the mu
sical spotlight this week as he led
off the swing year with his annual
concert at Carnegie Hall last Fri
day night. Fourth in the series, the
Ellington program was very well
received by Ellington fans, jazz lov
ers, and by the curiosity seekers
who came to see this jazz musician
and his orchestra perform in the
great Carnegie Hall. The Duke had
to do without the services of one of
his key men as trombonist Joe
"Tricky Sam" Nanton is seriously
ill in Chicago and had to miss the
concert. Featured in the concert
was Ellington's own "Black, Brown,
and Beige Suite," which is soon to
be released as an album under the
Victor label.
This fall wiil see in the bookstores
"Duke Ellington" by Bary Ulanov,
editor of Metronome magazine. The
book is a biography of America's
world-famous jazz personality and
is being eagerly awaited by Elling
ton fans the nation over.
Two of the biggest names in mu
sic have decided that the past year
has been too much for th'eni and
are taking vacations effective now.
Harry James takes a six-week holi
day preceding his Mcadowbrook
stand in Los Angeles, and Louis
Armstrong is off on a brief rest, his
first in over two years. * * * Buddy
Stewart has taken the cue from
Anita O'Day and is leaving the
Gene Krupa outfit. Stewart, croon
er for that "drummin' man," would
rather stay in Hollywood with his
family and make records than go
on the road with the band. This
leaves Krupa up the proverbial
creek as far as vocalists are con
cerned. * * * Herbie Fields, sensa
tional altoman, clarinetist, and vo
calist with Lionel Hampton, will
leave "Pops" soon to form a band
of his own.
Lionel Leaps In
Months have passed and Decca
Recording Co. finally has issued a
jazz record. This is Lionel Hamp
ton's sequel to his best-selling hit
"Hamp's Boogie," and is titled
"Beulah's Boogie." The similarity
is quite understandable as "Pop's"
first eight-to-the-bar effort still
rates high among juke-box favor
ites; yet the resemblance doesn't
guarantee exciting music for the
listener. With Milt Buckner and
Hamp handling the piano chores,
the band rocks through some old
familiar riffs and accomplishes ab
solutely nothing. On the whole, this
side is a disappointment after the
rave notices the band has been pull
ing down throughout the nation.
On the reverse, we find an item
of worth as Hampton gives us his
version of "Million Dollar Smile."
Featuring the work of the leader on
vibes, the side affords Lionel the
opportunity to exhibit the fact that
he can play music in a subtle mood
as well as the frantic things that,
have been making him such a com
mercial success of late. Reminiscent
of his style when he performed with
the Goodman Quartet, Hampton
easily makes this the better side of
the two.
Mercer Melodies
Johnny Mercer comes through
once again with a novelty number
that is destined to be a juke-box
favorite. The tune is "Personality"
and contains plenty of that same
thing by Mr. Mercer. Accompany
ing Mercer are the Pied Pipers and
Paul Weston's orchestra. Both
these groups are very pleasing and
add to the general enjoyment of
the side.
The other side is a tunc entitled
"If I Knew Then" featuring the
same artists as "Personality." The
song is very run-of-the-mill, and
it seems a shame that such a vocal
ist as Mercer has to be saddled with
such mediocre material. Even with
this handicap, Mercer & Co. make
the disc fairly pleasant listening.
It seems that just like "Old Man
River," Johnny Mercer keeps rolling
along.
Count's Crew Capers
Count Basie's recent release is
another pair of riff tunes on Colum
bia label. The first side, "Queer
Street," is easily the most worthy
side and features a number of en
semble choruses in the typical Basic
tradition. Harry Edison plays his
fine trumpet, and, of course, the
Count and Rodney Richardson, the
bassist, carry on the usual piano
doghouse routine that seems to grace
every Basie disc.
The other side is a vocal treat-

ment of "Jivin" Joe Jackson" with
Ann Moore, the Count's new vocal
ist, in the spotlight. The tune is
without merit, and therefore any
comments would be wasted. Miss
Moore's efforts are quite average
and it is our opinion that Basie
would fare far better on wax if he
would allot more notes to such in
strumentalists as Illinois Jacquet,
who recently joined the band, and
Dickie Wells.

he can play music in a subtle mood
as well as the frantic things that,
have been making him such a com
mercial success of late. Reminiscent
of his style when he performed with
the Goodman Quartet, Hampton
easily makes this the better side of
the two.
Mercer Melodies
Johnny Mercer comes through
once again with a novelty number
that is destined to be a juke-box
favorite. The tune is "Personality"
and contains plenty of that same
thing by Mr. Mercer. Accompany
ing Mercer are the Pied Pipers and
Paul Weston's orchestra. Both
these groups are very pleasing and
add to the general enjoyment of
the side.
The other side is a tunc entitled
"If I Knew Then" featuring the
same artists as "Personality." The
song is very run-of-the-mill, and
it seems a shame that such a vocal
ist as Mercer has to be saddled with
such mediocre material. Even with
this handicap, Mercer & Co. make
the disc fairly pleasant listening.
It seems that just like "Old Man
River," Johnny Mercer keeps rolling
along.
Count's Crew Capers
Count Basie's recent release is
another pair of riff tunes on Colum
bia label. The first side, "Queer
Street," is easily the most worthy
side and features a number of en
semble choruses in the typical Basic
tradition. Harry Edison plays his
fine trumpet, and, of course, the
Count and Rodney Richardson, the
bassist, carry on the usual piano
doghouse routine that seems to grace
every Basie disc.
The other side is a vocal treat-

ment of "Jivin" Joe Jackson" with
Ann Moore, the Count's new vocal
ist, in the spotlight. The tune is
without merit, and therefore any
comments would be wasted. Miss
Moore's efforts are quite average
and it is our opinion that Basie
would fare far better on wax if he
would allot more notes to such in
strumentalists as Illinois Jacquet,
who recently joined the band, and
Dickie Wells.
MUSICAL NOTES
Duke Ellington landed in the mu
sical spotlight this week as he led
off the swing year with his annual
concert at Carnegie Hall last Fri
day night. Fourth in the series, the
Ellington program was very well
received by Ellington fans, jazz lov
ers, and by the curiosity seekers
who came to see this jazz musician
and his orchestra perform in the
great Carnegie Hall. The Duke had
to do without the services of one of
his key men as trombonist Joe
"Tricky Sam" Nanton is seriously
ill in Chicago and had to miss the
concert. Featured in the concert
was Ellington's own "Black, Brown,
and Beige Suite," which is soon to
be released as an album under the
Victor label.
This fall wiil see in the bookstores
"Duke Ellington" by Bary Ulanov,
editor of Metronome magazine. The
book is a biography of America's
world-famous jazz personality and
is being eagerly awaited by Elling
ton fans the nation over.
Two of the biggest names in mu
sic have decided that the past year
has been too much for th'eni and
are taking vacations effective now.
Harry James takes a six-week holi
day preceding his Mcadowbrook
stand in Los Angeles, and Louis
Armstrong is off on a brief rest, his
first in over two years. * * * Buddy
Stewart has taken the cue from
Anita O'Day and is leaving the
Gene Krupa outfit. Stewart, croon
er for that "drummin' man," would
rather stay in Hollywood with his
family and make records than go
on the road with the band. This
leaves Krupa up the proverbial
creek as far as vocalists are con
cerned. * * * Herbie Fields, sensa
tional altoman, clarinetist, and vo
calist with Lionel Hampton, will
leave "Pops" soon to form a band
of his own.
Lionel Leaps In
Months have passed and Decca
Recording Co. finally has issued a
jazz record. This is Lionel Hamp
ton's sequel to his best-selling hit
"Hamp's Boogie," and is titled
"Beulah's Boogie." The similarity
is quite understandable as "Pop's"
first eight-to-the-bar effort still
rates high among juke-box favor
ites; yet the resemblance doesn't
guarantee exciting music for the
listener. With Milt Buckner and
Hamp handling the piano chores,
the band rocks through some old
familiar riffs and accomplishes ab
solutely nothing. On the whole, this
side is a disappointment after the
rave notices the band has been pull
ing down throughout the nation.
On the reverse, we find an item
of worth as Hampton gives us his
version of "Million Dollar Smile."

"Duke Ellington" by Bary Ulanov,
editor of Metronome magazine. The
book is a biography of America's
world-famous jazz personality and
is being eagerly awaited by Elling
ton fans the nation over.
Two of the biggest names in mu
sic have decided that the past year
has been too much for th'eni and
are taking vacations effective now.
Harry James takes a six-week holi
day preceding his Mcadowbrook
stand in Los Angeles, and Louis
Armstrong is off on a brief rest, his
first in over two years. * * * Buddy
Stewart has taken the cue from
Anita O'Day and is leaving the
Gene Krupa outfit. Stewart, croon
er for that "drummin' man," would
rather stay in Hollywood with his
family and make records than go
on the road with the band. This
leaves Krupa up the proverbial
creek as far as vocalists are con
cerned. * * * Herbie Fields, sensa
tional altoman, clarinetist, and vo
calist with Lionel Hampton, will
leave "Pops" soon to form a band
of his own.
Lionel Leaps In
Months have passed and Decca
Recording Co. finally has issued a
jazz record. This is Lionel Hamp
ton's sequel to his best-selling hit
"Hamp's Boogie," and is titled
"Beulah's Boogie." The similarity
is quite understandable as "Pop's"
first eight-to-the-bar effort still
rates high among juke-box favor
ites; yet the resemblance doesn't
guarantee exciting music for the
listener. With Milt Buckner and
Hamp handling the piano chores,
the band rocks through some old
familiar riffs and accomplishes ab
solutely nothing. On the whole, this
side is a disappointment after the
rave notices the band has been pull
ing down throughout the nation.
On the reverse, we find an item
of worth as Hampton gives us his
version of "Million Dollar Smile."
Featuring the work of the leader on
vibes, the side affords Lionel the
opportunity to exhibit the fact that
he can play music in a subtle mood
as well as the frantic things that,
have been making him such a com
mercial success of late. Reminiscent
of his style when he performed with
the Goodman Quartet, Hampton
easily makes this the better side of
the two.
Mercer Melodies
Johnny Mercer comes through
once again with a novelty number
that is destined to be a juke-box
favorite. The tune is "Personality"
and contains plenty of that same
thing by Mr. Mercer. Accompany
ing Mercer are the Pied Pipers and
Paul Weston's orchestra. Both
these groups are very pleasing and
add to the general enjoyment of
the side.
The other side is a tunc entitled
"If I Knew Then" featuring the
same artists as "Personality." The
song is very run-of-the-mill, and
it seems a shame that such a vocal
ist as Mercer has to be saddled with
such mediocre material. Even with
this handicap, Mercer & Co. make
the disc fairly pleasant listening.
It seems that just like "Old Man
River," Johnny Mercer keeps rolling
along.
Count's Crew Capers
Count Basie's recent release is
another pair of riff tunes on Colum
bia label. The first side, "Queer
Street," is easily the most worthy
side and features a number of en
semble choruses in the typical Basic
tradition. Harry Edison plays his
fine trumpet, and, of course, the
Count and Rodney Richardson, the
bassist, carry on the usual piano
doghouse routine that seems to grace
every Basie disc.
The other side is a vocal treat-

ment of "Jivin" Joe Jackson" with
Ann Moore, the Count's new vocal
ist, in the spotlight. The tune is
without merit, and therefore any
comments would be wasted. Miss
Moore's efforts are quite average
and it is our opinion that Basie
would fare far better on wax if he
would allot more notes to such in
strumentalists as Illinois Jacquet,
who recently joined the band, and
Dickie Wells.
MUSICAL NOTES
Duke Ellington landed in the mu
sical spotlight this week as he led
off the swing year with his annual
concert at Carnegie Hall last Fri
day night. Fourth in the series, the
Ellington program was very well
received by Ellington fans, jazz lov
ers, and by the curiosity seekers
who came to see this jazz musician
and his orchestra perform in the
great Carnegie Hall. The Duke had
to do without the services of one of
his key men as trombonist Joe
"Tricky Sam" Nanton is seriously
ill in Chicago and had to miss the
concert. Featured in the concert
was Ellington's own "Black, Brown,
and Beige Suite," which is soon to
be released as an album under the
Victor label.
