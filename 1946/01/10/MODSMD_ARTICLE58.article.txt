# Suspects Fill 'Fallen Angel'

### 
"Fallen Angel" Now IMaying
At the Stanford Theatre
Fallen Angel, which is as good a
name for a movie as any other, is in
the tough guy or Double Indemnity
tradition of film making. Its char
acters are really rough. Dana An
drews, a newcomer, has the role of
a fast talking ne'er-do-well who is
nothing but trouble for our heroine.
Alice Faye, who is the recipient
of the aforementioned hard times, is
the only person in the movie with
characteristics resembling people
you and I might know. She portrays
an intelligent, sweet young thing
and is not bad considering that this
must be quite a task for Miss Faye.
Plot Unfolds
The plot goes something like this:
Dana Andrews lands pennyless in
some jerkwater town. It is not long
before he shows all the symptoms
for Linda Darnell. Their affair hits
a stone wall when she holds out for
evidences of his bank account.
This hamburger joint waitress has
relusions of grandeur and considers

no offers from suitors who can't
show 10,000 greenies. Dana Andrews
handles this situation rather well by
fast talking himself into marriage
with Alice Faye, from whom he in
tends to sponge the required amount.
Murder
After this is accomplished Linda
Darnell turns up murdered which is
what usually happens to people in
movies, who keep bad company.
From here on in we have a "who
done it?" 1 wouldn't think of telling
anything except that Charles Bick
ford, and Bruce Cabot arc among
the suspects. As for a verdict I
should say that you will at least be
kept interested and probably find
yourself enjoying the thing. You've
seen worse.
The less said about the second fea
ture the better. There is always the
news reel though.—Rotenberg.
