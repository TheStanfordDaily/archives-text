# Orchestra Needs Vacancies Filled
## 
### 
Vacancies in the base, bassoon,
trumpet, and French horn sections
of the orchestra appeared in the first
meeting of the group this quarter,
reported Howard Martin, orchestra
manager.
The string and woodwind sections
seem to be adequate.
Anyone interested in joining the
group and particularly those play
ing any of the above instruments
are urged to come out to the weekly
meeting next Monday night at 7.
Tryouts will not be necessary.
