# Conference Game, Dances Fill Farm Schedule for Friday Night
## Experts May Be Wrong Once, Indians Might Upset Bears 
### STU MILLAR 
Out to break into the Pacific Coast win column for the first time in
three years, Stanford's varsity basketball team will trot out onto (lie
Pavilion floor to meet California's rampaging Bears as distinct underdoes
tonight.
Stanford Coach Everett Doan has named a tentative starting lineup

that includes Tom Murphy, trans
fer from the University of Rich
mond, Virginia, and Jim Hill, sec
ond high scorer in the southern di
vision of the conference, at for
wards; Bill O'Brien, (> ft. 6 in. vet
eran, at center; Gene Martin and
either Sloat or Pat Taylor at guards.
Nib Price, California mentor, will
counter with La Faille and Wolfe
at forwards, Smith at center, and
Hoyeboom and Wray at guards.
This California five has been
working together since the begin
ning of the season and has proved
successful. Winning all its prac
tice contests except a few against
some tough teams from the city,
the Bear quintet entered confer
ence competition as co-favorite
with Southern California for the
title.
Opening at its own court against
U.C.L.A. last week-end, the Bear
was forced to pull both games out
of the fire in the closing moments.
The score of the second game was
.'l7 to Adding this to the fact that
the Bruins were playing with three
first string men out of the lineup—
Miller, Sawyer, and Michaels—it is
easy to see that Cal is far from in
vincible.
Nevertheless, it is a tough, sharp
team. It should be rebounding from
last week-end's scare. Led lpy the
high - scoring Wolfe, the Bears
would pose a definite threat to any
team in the nation. Wolfe, who spe
cializes in jump shots after cutting
across court from his forward posi
tion, is almost unstoppable when
hot. Hogeboom and Wray are both
solid guards, hard men to get
around. And big Smith isn't classed
as the easiest man in the world to
outjump in backboard competition.
On the other hand. Dean has
been continually changing bis
lineup and not because he has
found better men. Injuries have
continually hampered bis efforts
to produce a consistent team. Bill
Christiansen is scheduled to sec
limited action at best and Tom
Rodman will not even suit up for
the game. Offensively, the Cards
will be satisfied if they do as well
as they did in the first S.C. game
when they racked up 41) points.
And better things can he expected
now that Murphy, who was upped
to the first string after only two
workouts with the team, has had
more time to fit in smoothly.
It is defensively that the Reds
must improve. They are on the up
grade in this department, cutting 19
points off the U.S.C. total during
the second game of that series. But
they must keep up the good work.
But the locals have refused to let
newspaper clippings ruin their spir
it. They are ambitious to knock Cal
off its pedestal. They are going into
the game with but one thought.
Cal can be beaten.
Whether they can do it is the
question that the packed pavilion
will have answered for them to
night.
A preliminary game is sched
uled for (>:!»0. Forest Anderson.
Coach Dean's assistant, will start
Roschill, Wood, Arms, Shoupc
and Hughes.

team. It should be rebounding from
last week-end's scare. Led lpy the
high - scoring Wolfe, the Bears
would pose a definite threat to any
team in the nation. Wolfe, who spe
cializes in jump shots after cutting
across court from his forward posi
tion, is almost unstoppable when
hot. Hogeboom and Wray are both
solid guards, hard men to get
around. And big Smith isn't classed
as the easiest man in the world to
outjump in backboard competition.
On the other hand. Dean has
been continually changing bis
lineup and not because he has
found better men. Injuries have
continually hampered bis efforts
to produce a consistent team. Bill
Christiansen is scheduled to sec
limited action at best and Tom
Rodman will not even suit up for
the game. Offensively, the Cards
will be satisfied if they do as well
as they did in the first S.C. game
when they racked up 41) points.
And better things can he expected
now that Murphy, who was upped
to the first string after only two
workouts with the team, has had
more time to fit in smoothly.
It is defensively that the Reds
must improve. They are on the up
grade in this department, cutting 19
points off the U.S.C. total during
the second game of that series. But
they must keep up the good work.
But the locals have refused to let
newspaper clippings ruin their spir

off its pedestal. They are going into
the game with but one thought.
Cal can be beaten.

Stanford Coach Everett Doan has named a tentative starting lineup

Nib Price, California mentor, will

This California five has been
working together since the begin

successful. Winning all its prac
tice contests except a few against
some tough teams from the city,
the Bear quintet entered confer
ence competition as co-favorite
with Southern California for the
title.
Opening at its own court against
U.C.L.A. last week-end, the Bear
was forced to pull both games out
of the fire in the closing moments.
The score of the second game was
.'l7 to Adding this to the fact that
the Bruins were playing with three
first string men out of the lineup—
Miller, Sawyer, and Michaels—it is
easy to see that Cal is far from in
