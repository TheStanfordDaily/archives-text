Upperclass women's living units v/ill shake
out their welcome mats this Sunday and make
ready for the first in a series of open houses
designed to introduce freshman and new wom
en to other women on campus and to show
them the types of living groups before they
draw spring quarter for next year's room.
Whether they know it or not, freshman wom
en who sign up to visit houses and casas this
weekend will be the first to participate in a
normal working out of a women's housing pro
gram that was perfected and approved last
year and hastily put into effect during spring
quarier, '45. Faced with a new situation, in
volving, for some houses at least, a new type
of designation of living unit members by lot
system only, Stanford women last spring had
to crowd the acquaintance period and the room
drawing period all into the same quarter. Con
fusion was inevitable, and added to by the un
usually large numbers of women who were
moving into upperclass residences. This year,
with a smaller freshman class, we hope these
chaotic conditions can be avoided and more
women be given their first choice in room and
house assignment.
We also hope that freshman women under
stand the ideals and conditions for which the
persons who drew up the housing plan worked.
The setting up of a social program to acquaint
new and old women was based on a number
of simple, but essential contentions:
(1) that a fairly congenial group is usually
necessary for pleasant living; (2) that Stanford
women need no basis for selection of living
group members other than their willingness to
accept the responsibilities connected with the
living group; (3) that Stanford women if they
are given opportunity to become acquainted
with each other, will, through mutual under
standing, select intelligently the group with
which they will be most congenial.
Such a program won't be perfected over
night. No one should expect it to; its develop
ment will require effort and understanding from
everyone; the results, we feel, should be
worth it.
