Modern art is important as an ex
pression of our time, explained Dr.
Grace L. McCann Morley in her
lecture on Latin-American art last
night in Cubberley Auditorium.
The lecture, which was under the
direction of the School of Humani
ties, was presented in connection
with the current exhibit of Latin-
American paintings now showing at
the Stanford Art Gallery.
Not every modern painting is a
masterpiece, by any means, Dr.
Morley admitted, but the art of our
time is a part of ourselves. Con
temporary art shows not only a
greater variety and range of expres
sion than art has in the past, but
also a greater specialization of in
dividuals.
She said that although the schools
in the various countries differ
greatly, they all have one thing in
common—they are new. They all
face the problem of adapting im
ported styles to their own particular
localities.
The artists, she explained, arc
catching ideas from every source.
In Mexico and Peru, in particular,
ari lists are being stimulated by an
cient Indian traditions in art.
Of the pictures which were shown
on slides to illustrate the lecture,
Dr. Morley said. "Each shows crea
tive power and illustrates an im
portant development or trend.
The first pictures shown were
those by Mexicans, who originated
the first art movement in the West
ern Hemisphere.
After the lecture Dr. Morley an
swered questions presented by the
audience. She was introduced by
