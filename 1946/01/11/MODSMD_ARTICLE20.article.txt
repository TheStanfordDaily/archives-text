# "A Long, Long Time ..."
## 
### 
Tonight is Farm opening night—as far as the
majority of the Stanford student body is con
cerned, anyway—for Stanford's return to Pa
cific Coast intercollegiate sports circles; and,
as the sports staff informed us, tonight is the
first time Stanford has engaged in official sports
competition with the Bears from across the bay
since a baseball game of May 15, 1943!
So now it's basketball, and, as in previous
games this year, Coach Everett Dean's boys will
be handicapped by inexperience and injuries
when they meet the highly-touted Cal five.
The spirit's there, though, and Stanford rooters
—new and old students, men who have just
returned, and alumni—have a "Big Game,"
their first in almost three years, to yell about.
