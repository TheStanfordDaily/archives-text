Dear Coach Dean:
All kinds of nasty things are being said about
your basketball team —things about the team
not having a chance against Cal, just because
Cal refuses to play the game in one of the wards
at the Paly hospital.
Now this idea of winning a game without a
regular team doesn't take much figuring out.
Of course, there's the obvious way of winning
arming your men with black jacks. It's a
sure-fire method, but referees are so petty about
things like that.
No, Mr. Dean, you've got to be subtle about
this thing. For instance, it would be guite sim
ple to trick Cal's key man into being dispensed

with. You'll have to wait until half-time to take
action, though.
Then send one of your more attractive en
voys down to the Cal dressing room, asking
this key player to help in the half-time enter
tainment. It'll take little flattery for the envoy
to get the player completely in her clutches —
this Cal man who is used to nothing but fog and
rowdyism.
Once the player is out on the floor, Mr. Dean,
you can chuckle and take off your mourning
clothes. The game will be cinched by then.
You should have the rooting section coached,
so that when the player comes out onto the
floor, the rooters will scream and stomp for him.
It'll make him feel that he's wanted, y' know.
After this Cal man has finished bowing and
shaking his clasped hands over his head, your
envoy should explain that they would like to
have him participate in a little Axe routine.
Throw in a few words about the Stanford-Cal
good neighbor policy, and all that.
Then the rooters should go into the Axe rou
tine, only scalp the Cal man at some appro
priate point in the routine. That's all there is
to it—simple, good clean fun, and all under the
heading of "half-time entertainment."
This whole plot is based on the assumption
that you are willing to dawdle along, playing
Cal until half-time. Here's a plan for taking
over the game immediately after the first time
out period.
Simply give the Cal water-boy a pass to the
Bob Hope show (o, 10, how easily are these
faint hearts bribed), and fill the Cal drinking
jars with something nice and white —like tur
pentine or sloe gin.
Then the first time the Cal boys get thirsty,
the game is yours. Send a representative from
Excom out to sniff faintly around the prostrate
forms of the Cal team, have them disqualified
by a referee or someone, and then have the
floor cleared, free of charge, by the Paly police
force.
Take your pick, Mr. Dean, or ask us for more
suggestions, if you think that these methods
are too subtle to be effective.
Happy scalping.

tainment. It'll take little flattery for the envoy
to get the player completely in her clutches —
this Cal man who is used to nothing but fog and
rowdyism.
Once the player is out on the floor, Mr. Dean,
you can chuckle and take off your mourning
clothes. The game will be cinched by then.
You should have the rooting section coached,
so that when the player comes out onto the
floor, the rooters will scream and stomp for him.
It'll make him feel that he's wanted, y' know.
After this Cal man has finished bowing and
shaking his clasped hands over his head, your
envoy should explain that they would like to
have him participate in a little Axe routine.
Throw in a few words about the Stanford-Cal
good neighbor policy, and all that.
Then the rooters should go into the Axe rou
tine, only scalp the Cal man at some appro
priate point in the routine. That's all there is
to it—simple, good clean fun, and all under the
heading of "half-time entertainment."
This whole plot is based on the assumption
that you are willing to dawdle along, playing
Cal until half-time. Here's a plan for taking
over the game immediately after the first time
out period.
Simply give the Cal water-boy a pass to the
Bob Hope show (o, 10, how easily are these
faint hearts bribed), and fill the Cal drinking
jars with something nice and white —like tur
pentine or sloe gin.
Then the first time the Cal boys get thirsty,
the game is yours. Send a representative from
Excom out to sniff faintly around the prostrate
forms of the Cal team, have them disqualified
by a referee or someone, and then have the
floor cleared, free of charge, by the Paly police
force.
Take your pick, Mr. Dean, or ask us for more
suggestions, if you think that these methods
are too subtle to be effective.
Happy scalping.
Dear Coach Dean:
All kinds of nasty things are being said about
your basketball team —things about the team
not having a chance against Cal, just because
Cal refuses to play the game in one of the wards
at the Paly hospital.
Now this idea of winning a game without a
regular team doesn't take much figuring out.
Of course, there's the obvious way of winning
arming your men with black jacks. It's a
sure-fire method, but referees are so petty about
things like that.
No, Mr. Dean, you've got to be subtle about
this thing. For instance, it would be guite sim
ple to trick Cal's key man into being dispensed

with. You'll have to wait until half-time to take
action, though.
Then send one of your more attractive en
voys down to the Cal dressing room, asking
this key player to help in the half-time enter
tainment. It'll take little flattery for the envoy
to get the player completely in her clutches —
this Cal man who is used to nothing but fog and
rowdyism.
