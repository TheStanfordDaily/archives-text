Was the world divided into three spheres of
influence? It might very well have been. Re
cent events seem to prove it, and more.
If this was done, how was it accomplished?
The early Big Three meetings when that group
had Roosevelt and Churchill in it could have
done it. The medium might have been tacit
agreement.
PROOF
But what proof was there that this was done?
When the Italian campaign developed beyond
the capture of Foggia airdrome and the port
facilities at Bari, we had enough to make that
country a jumping off point for a leap across
the Adriatic. Beyond lay the lugoslavian coast.
Much of it was controlled by friendly partisan
groups. Such a move might not have been too
difficult.
Then, the need of the war was diverting
German reserves. If the country behind the
Nazi lines was bare, a breakthrough any place
meant disaster. The Italian campaign was de
scribed as a diversion, meaning it was designed
to draw off enemy forces from northern Eu
rope. Yet, it could only siphon in enough
forces to protect the industries north of the Po.
A Balkan campaign at that time could have
poised a threat to the plains of Hungary and an
easy road into Berlin. That would draw off
much more than the Italian campaign would.
And, if the Nazis concentrated against such a
drive - with too much force, we could fall back
into any of the large mountain ranges in the
area and make a stand.
Yet, no Anglo-American Balkan campaign
was attempted.
RUSS BALKAN DRIVE
When the Russians reached the Balkans, the
situation had changed. The Red Army was
also near enough to Germany proper to reach
it with one strike. Such a blow would have
ended the war then. The conflict was in its
last stages, and a final push, not a diversionary
thrust, was in order.
Yet, the Russians took time out of steam
rolling through the Balkans. Why? The oil re
serves in Roumania were not needed by them
or the Nazis, who were operating on synthetic
gasoline. The threat to the Russian flank v/as
negligible, because, if it developed, the Rus
sians had the air strength to discover it and the
interior lines to use to meet it.
The only alternative was that Russia had
been promised the majority of the Balkans,
and moved in to stake her claim. We did not
do so, even though it was militarily advisable,
because we had promised not to.
Still, Britain moved into Greece, and diverted
troops from our pet Italian campaign. It is
likely that the recognition of her interests along
the Mediterranean coast was compensation for
the Russian expansion.

rope. Yet, it could only siphon in enough
forces to protect the industries north of the Po.
A Balkan campaign at that time could have
poised a threat to the plains of Hungary and an
easy road into Berlin. That would draw off
much more than the Italian campaign would.
And, if the Nazis concentrated against such a
drive - with too much force, we could fall back
into any of the large mountain ranges in the
area and make a stand.
Yet, no Anglo-American Balkan campaign
was attempted.
RUSS BALKAN DRIVE
When the Russians reached the Balkans, the
situation had changed. The Red Army was
also near enough to Germany proper to reach
it with one strike. Such a blow would have
ended the war then. The conflict was in its
last stages, and a final push, not a diversionary
thrust, was in order.
Yet, the Russians took time out of steam
rolling through the Balkans. Why? The oil re
serves in Roumania were not needed by them
or the Nazis, who were operating on synthetic
gasoline. The threat to the Russian flank v/as
negligible, because, if it developed, the Rus
sians had the air strength to discover it and the
interior lines to use to meet it.
The only alternative was that Russia had
been promised the majority of the Balkans,
and moved in to stake her claim. We did not
do so, even though it was militarily advisable,
because we had promised not to.
Still, Britain moved into Greece, and diverted
troops from our pet Italian campaign. It is
likely that the recognition of her interests along
the Mediterranean coast was compensation for
the Russian expansion.

Was the world divided into three spheres of
influence? It might very well have been. Re
cent events seem to prove it, and more.
If this was done, how was it accomplished?
The early Big Three meetings when that group
had Roosevelt and Churchill in it could have
done it. The medium might have been tacit
agreement.
PROOF
But what proof was there that this was done?
When the Italian campaign developed beyond
the capture of Foggia airdrome and the port
facilities at Bari, we had enough to make that
country a jumping off point for a leap across
the Adriatic. Beyond lay the lugoslavian coast.
Much of it was controlled by friendly partisan
groups. Such a move might not have been too
difficult.
Then, the need of the war was diverting
German reserves. If the country behind the
Nazi lines was bare, a breakthrough any place
meant disaster. The Italian campaign was de
scribed as a diversion, meaning it was designed
to draw off enemy forces from northern Eu
rope. Yet, it could only siphon in enough
forces to protect the industries north of the Po.
