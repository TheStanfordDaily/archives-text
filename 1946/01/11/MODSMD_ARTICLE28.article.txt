# Dr. Greene States Objectives, Importance of Liberal Education
## 
### 
"The Place of Science in Liberal |
Arts Curriculum" was the topic of
the speech by Dr. Theodore M. j
Greene, visiting professor of hu
manities at Stanford this year from
Princeton University, at the Bio
logical Science Department's week
ly seminar yesterday afternoon.
According to Dr. Greene, the tour
objectives of a liberal education are
linguistic, factual, evaluative, and
perspective. Under linguistic, man's
ability to understand and use lan
guages not only correctly but also j
felicitously is important.
Importance of Facts
Young people should learn im
portant and necessary facts and be
able to recognize a fact when they
see one. They should be made more
realistic with respect to facts.
People should be more sensitive
and informed in religious, moral,
and esthetic values and in these
controversial subjects, liberal edu
cation should cultivate more sensi
tive feelings.
Man is tar too provincial and is
thus fenced in and necessarily dog
matic. He shows no imagination of
other points of view and it is the
job of liberal education to raise
horizons. Man should become less

provincial and see more in great i
perspective.
Science Contributions
Science contributes more to the j
factual of these points of view than j
any other discipline. It trains pre- j
?ise and controlled observation in i
laboratory experiments. Science is I
the perfect training ground for a '
realistic attitude.
The mathematical and scientific '
language is used quite explicitly;
however, plain ordinary English |
used in science does not have such
a high standard.
Natural Piety
Science should induce a certain
natural piety and this perspective
should increase students' sense of
human finitude and also their hu
mility and tolerance.
Many students oppose taking sci
ence and when focced to take it by
lower division requirements and do
good work in it, say that they never
get much from the course.
Attitudes of Students
Three explanations of this atti
tude have been advanced. For one
thing, students believe that labora
tory experiments are too matter-of
fact rather than being explorative.
In historical science, old theories are

i qiven that have been improved j
i upon and their defects are sluffed !
over. Scientists think that ele- j
! mentary science is the first rung in
| the ladder to the Ph.D. in that sci
| once alone.
Science majors have no perspec- |
i tive in their science and its signili- (
I cance. They should see the major

| issue more in perspective.
Scientific Evaluation
The scientific mind has something
I to contribute in evaluation; how
| 2ver, intrinsic values cannot be
j translated into science. Science can
j tell you all man can know in facts,
I but it can never settle questions
of value.
