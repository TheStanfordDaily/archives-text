## Cards Prepare to Upset Bears in Week-end Tilts 
### SMILEY FARKAS BOB FECK 
The Bears come back to the Farm
j tonight and all of us who shelled
| out our 50 cents will get a glimpse
| or two at their particular brand of
basketball. Tomorrow night, on the
often described attractive Cal cam
pus, they will again perform.
Now while almost all of the ex
perts figure that the Bears ought
to trample the Indian defenders,
there are others who say the Stan
ford team will give them a good
; rassle for top spot.
If the Indians are able to pull the
j trick, it will be a major upset in the
[ basketball picture. Cal is riding on
the crest of fifteen victories out of
seventeen attempts and the Indians
have lost four out of six.
Let's put it like this: Stanford had
two bad beatings administered to it
at Reno. Cal won one game there
and lost another. The Cardinals saw

the Bears perform and thought they
were good. The Bears saw the Cards
perform and thought they were
strictly from the bushes. They prob
ably still think the same.
On the basis of that, it looks like
a tough row for the Indians to hoe.
It seems that almost a superhuman
effort would be required to upset
the dipe. Can they do it? Well , . .
The Cal team figures that they're
a lead pipe cinch. Our contention
is that the Bears may be ripe for a
plucking, and can you name a bet
ter team to do the plucking than
our bowed but not bent boys?
We think the boys can do it. True,
they're a little weak at center and
at one of the guards, but if the men
in those positions can hold their
own, the rest of the club may carry
them through. All this, of course, is
in the realm of conjecture.
But the point we're trying to raise
is that the Cards do have a chance,
and that anyone who sells them
short does so at his (or her) own
risk. For example, Stanford has
three men among the top ten scor
ers in the P.C.C.'s Dixie Division.
Jim Hill netted 26 points, Gene
Martin plunked in 20, and Tom
Murphy scored 15. Cal's Andy
Wolfe tallied 23â€”and he's Price's
only man in the Big Ten.
j Another thing is that Cal has none
of Troy's classy ball-handling, pre
ferring a more sober type of play
that may or may not make for bet
ter basketball, but is certainly much
duller. And yet the kids, against a
U.S.C. offense that made duck soup
of their defense (another weak spot
that plagues the locals), gave Troy's
Sam Barry the beginnings of more
than one gray hair.
A little thing like spirit has often
worked wonders against a crowd
that was blatantly cocksure (Cal).
Playing on their home court adds
another mite to Stanford's side of
the scales, and still another iota
may be squeezed out of the specta
tors (if they are partisan enough).
That they'll be partisan enough
tonight there is no doubt. But to
morrow night at Berkeley the shoe
changes feet. Anyway, two good
games are on tap for the fans. Come
and bring a friend; bring both your
friends.
