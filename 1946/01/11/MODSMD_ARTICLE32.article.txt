### ART LEVINSON 
If at 4;30 on Thursday afternoon,
students of the campus were dis
turbed from their usual mid-after
noon study period by loud and hys
terical screams, they can throw
their invectives toward the direc
tion of the Daily Shack, for therein
arose the great conflict.
And what was the confusion
over? Whether women are capable
sports writers or not. In pre-war
days, never such an argument
would have taken place, for the
Daily was strictly run by the mas
culine department of the Stanford
student body, and those women who
dared enter the sanctified Shack
wouldn't have dared to speak their
mind; but the war has changed the
situation.
The disappearance of the male
put the women in charge of the
Daily, and they haven't retired from
the scene yet. The situation, how
ever, is improving, for no longer is
the appearance of a male the cause
for amazement and awe.
Our basketball man, Smiley Far
kas, was busily writing an article
when some feminine member of the
paper began shouting at him the
greatness of women sports writers.
Jumping to his guard, Smiley—sci
entifically and coolly—refuted every
wild boast made by one of the more
hysterical staff members. The ar
gument awoke this writer from his
pleasant sleep, and he \fcas drawn
into the near-riot that shortly fol
lowed. Others were drawn into the
violent fray, and then the remark
that the Cal daily employed women
sports writers was made. We were
deeply shocked over this invasion
into the honored sports ranks by
Nina Westigard and Cynthia Brown,
but after further descriptions, we
began to think that maybe a few
similar women working on the
Stanford Sports Staff would be a
good idea. The idea becomes more
enticing all the time.
Brushing aside the ridiculous, ex
citement is reaching a high peak for
tonight's basketball encounter with
California. Though rated under
dogs, this writer predicts a Stan
ford victory. This pessimism has
gone too far. Our team isn't that

bad, and Cal isn't near the team
they have beeen described as in
certain' campus circles. Cal's over
confidence, plus playing on our
home court, makes us believe a
Stanford victory is very likely.
To confirm my suspicions of a
Cardinal victory, Bob Peck said:
"They (Cal) undoubtedly have a
better and more experienced team
than we do. Andy Wolfe is one of
the really great players in the na
tion. But Stanford has been wait
ing to get a crack at California for
the last two years. I've seen many
underdog Indian squads in the past
fight their way to victory over high
ly favored teams. I won't concede
the Bears a thing. Score? Stanford
by three points."
Now that we're through quoting
Bob Peck's noble words, we would
only like to add that the team de
serves the rooting of every Stanford
student. What if you do get hoarse?
The profs won't miss your voice.
See ya tonight.

deeply shocked over this invasion
into the honored sports ranks by
Nina Westigard and Cynthia Brown,
but after further descriptions, we
began to think that maybe a few
similar women working on the
Stanford Sports Staff would be a
good idea. The idea becomes more
enticing all the time.
Brushing aside the ridiculous, ex
citement is reaching a high peak for
tonight's basketball encounter with
California. Though rated under
dogs, this writer predicts a Stan
ford victory. This pessimism has
gone too far. Our team isn't that

bad, and Cal isn't near the team
they have beeen described as in
certain' campus circles. Cal's over
confidence, plus playing on our
home court, makes us believe a
Stanford victory is very likely.
To confirm my suspicions of a
Cardinal victory, Bob Peck said:
"They (Cal) undoubtedly have a
better and more experienced team
than we do. Andy Wolfe is one of
the really great players in the na
tion. But Stanford has been wait
ing to get a crack at California for
the last two years. I've seen many
underdog Indian squads in the past
fight their way to victory over high
ly favored teams. I won't concede
the Bears a thing. Score? Stanford
by three points."
Now that we're through quoting
Bob Peck's noble words, we would
only like to add that the team de
serves the rooting of every Stanford
student. What if you do get hoarse?
The profs won't miss your voice.
See ya tonight.
If at 4;30 on Thursday afternoon,
students of the campus were dis
turbed from their usual mid-after
noon study period by loud and hys
terical screams, they can throw
their invectives toward the direc
tion of the Daily Shack, for therein
arose the great conflict.
And what was the confusion
over? Whether women are capable
sports writers or not. In pre-war
days, never such an argument
would have taken place, for the
Daily was strictly run by the mas
culine department of the Stanford
student body, and those women who
dared enter the sanctified Shack
wouldn't have dared to speak their
mind; but the war has changed the
situation.
The disappearance of the male
put the women in charge of the
Daily, and they haven't retired from
the scene yet. The situation, how
ever, is improving, for no longer is
the appearance of a male the cause
for amazement and awe.
Our basketball man, Smiley Far
kas, was busily writing an article
when some feminine member of the
paper began shouting at him the
greatness of women sports writers.
Jumping to his guard, Smiley—sci
entifically and coolly—refuted every
wild boast made by one of the more
hysterical staff members. The ar
gument awoke this writer from his
pleasant sleep, and he \fcas drawn
into the near-riot that shortly fol
lowed. Others were drawn into the
violent fray, and then the remark
that the Cal daily employed women
sports writers was made. We were
