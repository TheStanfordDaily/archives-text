# Dr. Gardner, 'The Padre,' Reviews Chapel's History
## 
### MARY KENNEDY 
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, known to
generations of Stanford students as
"the padre," was chaplain of the
Memorial Church from 1902 to 1936.
After addressing the graduation
class of 1936, he retired. Dr. Gard
ner spoke with feeling about the
founding of the Stanford Chapel and
of the ideals that were the basis
for its foundation. Mrs. Stanford
had said that although her heart
was in the University, her soul was
in the church. The church had its
first baccalaureate service in 1903.
Sorrow came to the beautiful
church for the first time when
members of the graduating class of
1903 died from typhoid fever during
the month of their graduation.
Services Non-Sectarian
"The Stanford Chapel was dedi
cated as a memorial to Leland Stan
ford, Sr. From the very beginning
the idea was to keep the service
strictly on a non - partisan and
non-sectarian basis," said Dr. Gard
ner. Tht' church was never to be
used as an instrument of a political
party or group. Distinguished cler
gy have come from every spot in
the world to give sermons in the
Chapel.
In ICO6 the earthquake greatly
damaged the church. By 1916 the
mosaics had been restored, but the
Apostles, sculptured in Italian Car
rara marble, and the Rose window
were never replaced. This terrible
disaster fortunately happened after
Mrs. Stanford's death. In order that
such a disaster would not be re
peated, the Chapel was rebuilt on
a firmer foundation.
Open All Day
"The position of the church to the
University, to me," said Dr. Gard
ner, "is a place of prayer, where
troubled students may go." In keep
ing with this idea, the Chapel is
open all day. As Mrs. Stanford had
said, went on Dr. Gardner, that
without teaching a belief in God
and His beloved Son and life be
yond this earth, the University fails
in its most vital importance.
Religion in Common Life
The Stanford Memorial Church is
a symbol of the spiritual life of the
Stanford academic community. The

University is seeking to present re- !
ligion as something that is involved
in common life. It is said that noth
ing can take the place of decency,
and this idea is what the church is
trying to implant in the lives of the
students. President Wilson once
said that the Memorial Church had |
a profound effect upon the spiritual
and moral development of the en- I
tire Stanford community.
Chaplains like Dr. Gardner have J
made the Memorial Chapel an out- i
standing example of an institution J
which promotes the ideals and prin- |
ciples that founded Stanford Uni- ;
versity.
