CHUNGKING, Jan. 10 (UP).—
j Generalissimo Chiang Kai - slick
opened the People's Consultative
Council today by announcing the
| end of the Chinese civil war and a
government amnesty for all politi-
I cal prisoners.
To guarantee the peace, in addi
| tion to the amnesty, he also pro
claimed full civil liberties for the
j Chinese people and equalization of
! the Communist party with the gov
| ernment Kuomintang party,
j A special three-man commission
headed by American Charge d'Af
faires Martin Robertson was created
to set up headquarters in Peiping
and order an immediate official halt
to the bloody fighting that has
wracked China for more than 18
| years.
The agreement, reached in a
special early morning meeting of
Gen. George C. Marshall's peacc
commission, called for immediate
cessation of troop movements
from the Yangtze River north to
the Manchurian border and, ac
cording to a reliable government
source, including Jchol province
of Manchuria.
The orders will reach field head
| quarters of main units of both
| armies before Saturday, a reliable
i government source said. Col. Henry
;A. Byronde, military attache of the
U.S. embassy, will fly to Peiping
within the next 24 hours to help set
up peace headquarters.
Railway, highway and postal
service was ordered resumed and
all communication road blocks
j removed immediately in a huge
area of North China rougly 800
miles deep and 1,000 miles wide.
The inclusion of Jehol province in
i the area where troop movements
j must hal was looked upon as a ma
jor Nationalist concession. Com
j munist leaders previously had de
| clared that peace could not be called
while Nationalist troops were driv
ing unchecked on the Jehol prov
ince capital of Changteh and the
second city of Chihfeng.
The cease-fire order leaves the
Communist party in control of all
areas they now hold, including a
major portion of Jehol and 12
provinces between the Yangtze
and the Manchurian border, until
a final political settlement is made
by the Consultative Council.
The agreement was reached at a
special meeting of Marshall's three
man peace commission called for 8
a.m., two hours before the Consul
tative Council opened.

LONDON, Jan. 1(1 (UP).—Dele
gates of 51 nations met today in a
momentous first Assembly of the
United Nations Organization to try
to lead the world toward permanent
peace as the alternative to contin
ued national rivalries which would
lead to the chaos of a third World
War, fought with atomic weapons.
The 2,000 delegates, alternates and
spectators crowded into Westmin
ster Central Hall, near ancient
Westminster Abbey and the bomb
damaged Houses of Parliament, on
the 26th anniversary of the official
birth of the League of Nations. The
fact seemed clear in delegates'
minds that the tragic failure of the
League was a warning that this
time peace-loving nations must not
"ail.
In the opening speech Prime
Minister Clement R. Attlee, wel
coming the delegates to London,
said that the UNO must become
the overriding factor in the for
eign policy of world nations.
A third World War, Attlee told
the delegates, might halt the prog
ress of civilization for generations.
Calling for the same sense of ur
gency and self-sacrifice in creating
permanent peace conditions as was
shown in fighting the war, Attlee
recalled how the purposes of the
League of Nations were defeated by
continuance of individual ambitions
and power politics.
"The United Nations Organiza
tion must become the overriding
factor in foreign policy," he said.
". . . The development of power
ful weapons of destruction, oper
ating from distant bases, has de
stroyed the illusion of isolation
ism.
"The coming of the atomic bomb
was only the last of a series of
warnings to mankind that unless
the powers of destruction could be
controlled immense ruin and al
most annihilation would be the lot
of the most highly civilized portions
of mankind."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UP).—
Undersecretary of War Kenneth C.
Royall, who is slated to appear be
fore a Senate subcommittee next
week to explain the Army's demo
bilization policy, charged tonight
that nationwide "hysteria to get the
boys* back home" is endangering
American occupation policy.
In a speech prepared for delivery
before the Roanoke, Va., Rotary
Club, he said that the public clamor
for faster demobilization "will en
danger the victory so recently won"
if it continues. In addition, he
charged that it added to the nation's
financial burden by leaving insuf
ficient men at home and abroad to
take care of vast excess property.
Royall and Gen. Dwight D. Ei
senhower, chief of staff, have been
asked to appear before a specially
ci'eated Senate subcommittee at
their earliest convenience. The Sen
ate created the subcommittee today
under the chairmanship of Sen. Ed
win C. Johnson, D., Colo., in an ef
fort to unscramble the muddle over
demobilization policy.
Royall said that an urge "to put
the war behind us and demobilize
quickly is threatening to impair the
necessary services which must be
rendered overseas."
He asked leaders in American
communities to assume the respon
sibility of ending "this hysteria"
since it is not a job for military or
congressional leaders.
