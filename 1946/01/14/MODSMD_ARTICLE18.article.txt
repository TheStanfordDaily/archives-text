# Indians Bow To California
## Novice Cards Outplayed 47-36,47-28; Christiansen Paces Farm Hoopsters 
### 
In the first renewal of "Big Game" contests with State U. at
Berkeley since spring of '43, Stanford's basketball team came
out second best 47-36 and 47-28, but showed promise of giving
the Bears and other conference opponents definite competition
from now on.
At the end of the first 15 minutes of play in Friday night's game in the
loeal Pavilion it was doubtful whether or not the Indians would even get
second place, the score being: Smith 12, Lafaille 5, Stanford 2. However,
the Red five managed to bring the score up to 26-12 at half-time, and even
outscored the visiting bears, 21-24, during the second period.
The Saturday evening game at Berkeley was a complete reversal in
the manner in which the play started. For five minutes the two teams
were even, both in play and on the scoreboard, but from then on Cali
fornia's five began hitting their long shots and moved out into a comfor
table lead which Stanford was never able to close.
High scorer for the series was Andy Wolfe, Cal's tattooed forward, with
27 points. In order to ring up his points, however, he was forced to take
more shots than any two other men on the court.
No Stanford man stood out over his teammates, although Capt. Bill
Christiansen, as a steadying influence and all-around player, is probably
the teams most valuable member. Bill O Bricn's defensive work during
the first game, and Jim Hill's ability to control the ball in the midst of
taller men under the Bear basket, were also noteworthy.
Coach Everett Dean tried a new man Friday night in Jack Meredith.
Scoring seven points and playing a strong game under the baskets, Mere
dith was impressive enough to win a starting assignment for the second
game.
In the renewal of another aspect of the Indian-Bear rivalry, the stu
dent body from Strawberry Canyon outstripped the Farm undergrads
in both organized and unorganized cheering, yelling, clapping, and gen
eral spirit. Perhaps this can be attributed to the A.S.S.U.'s lack of "know
bow" after more than two years with no intercollegiate competition, but
this excuse will not be valid for many more week-ends.
Overflow crowds both nights were held spellbound in their seats during
the half-time recesses by exhibitions of breath-taking tumbling, parallel
bar, and judo feats by the resin and canvas boys.
At the end of two weeks of play in the Pacific Coast Conference's South
ern Division basketball chase, Stanford stands in a tie for third place. The
U.C.L.A. Bruins, our co-cellar dwellers, will come up to the Farm this
coming week-end for games in the Pavilion Friday and Saturday evenings.
