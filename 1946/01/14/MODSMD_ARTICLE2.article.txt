# Congress Opens Today, Faces Critical Problems

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (UP). â€”The second session of the 79th Con
gress convenes tomorrow facing a sharp challenge from President Tru
man to act immediately on legislation vital to administration reconversion
policies.
The session may be one of the stormiest in years. Many members of
both parties still are smarting from the spanking Mr. Truman administered
in his last radio address to the nation. He charged then that Congress had
needlessly delayed consideration of urgent, measures.
High on the second session's agenda is the President's request for es
tablishment of the controversial fact-finding boards in labor disputes. Mr.
Truman has emphasized that such boards must have legal backing if they
are to prove effective.
The first order of business, however, will be an investigation of de
mobilization. This is considered a particularly explosive political issue in
this, an election year.
