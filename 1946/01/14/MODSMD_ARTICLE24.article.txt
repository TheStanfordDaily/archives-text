With a quarter of a million telephone work
ers read/ to strike, paralyzing the nation's en
tire telephone system, with walkouts in the
steel and meat-packing industries threatening
in rhort, with nearly half a million U.S. work
ers idle because of labor-management difficul
ties, we're wondering just how long, or just
what i. takes for the American people to'decide
they're lired of being pushed around, of being
inconvenienced, or of having their entire econ
omy threatened through government ineffec
tiveness and industrial chaos.
A raise in the economic status of labor is
nec-.ssary and laudable, we think. We also can
see a basis for management's objections to
certain proposals, such as opening its books to
fact 'hiding boards composed of members ar
bitrarily selected and actually having no clear
ly defined Federal duties, as do tax inspectors,
etc. The facts remain, however, that White
House action immediately after V J Day could
have saved the United States much of the pres
ent trouble.
Both labor and management, accustomed dur
ing the war to arbitration, the WLB, and a strong
national policy, were fearful of post-war indus
trial chaos and probably would have responded
willingly to intelligent governmental policy.
The White House, however, stripping the WLB
of its powers and then neglecting to formulate
anything to take its place, left management and
labor attempting to outmaneuver each other
before the official Labor-Management Confer
ence scheduled, belatedly, for November. Ma
neuver themselves they did, right into the pres
ent mess. Public opinion was not strong enough
at the crucial period this summer and fall; but
again the time has come for a demand for
peaceful arbitration and conciliation that is so
loud that neither labor, management, the White
House, nor Congress can ignore it.
