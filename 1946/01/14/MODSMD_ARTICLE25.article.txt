Note: This is a continuation of Friday's edi
torial concerning the growth of three spheres
of influence in the world.
ASIA
The greatest of enemies were Chiang and
Stalin. Chiang, by conquering the warlords
and unifying China, had grabbed the revolu
tion there right out of his hands. The two had
noi been on good terms since. When President
Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met
Chiang at Cairo, they had to go to Teheran to
meet Stalin. Apparently Chiang and Joe con
sidered it was better to keep hundred of miles
of desert, a river and a canal between them.
Yet, after the war, Russia signed a convention
with Nationist China. We have been dominat
ing the politics of the latter country, and it
seems that, although Russia was compensated,
a formula was worked out by which the pre
dominance of American interests was recog
nied in Asia.
THE MIDDLE EAST
The Teheran communique held an article re
specting the territorial integrity of Iran. The
rest of the Middle East was away from Russia's
borders and, in practice, controlled by British
interests and the British sponsored Arab
League. It seems England was given the pre
dominance of interest here.
Italy went under Anglo American control.
The occupation of Germany was split three
ways, and Poland is dominated by Russia. Thus
the picture of the partitioning of the world into
three spheres of influence is drawn.
It must be remembered that Roosevelt,
Churchill, and Stalin had an insight into the
workings of practical politics. That was and is
their greatest accomplishment. They had indi
vidual .difference, and it seems that the three
settled them by a practical, even classical, po
litical mechanism. It proved that there is noth
ing new in writing a peace, and also that such
arrangements, if drawn hastily, can lead to
trouble.
