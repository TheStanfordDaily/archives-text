So Bob Hope's coming. So what. If the Paly-
Sea Scouts aren't even being admitted, how
can the wimming on campus possibly expect

to get close enough to the Med Aud to get a
glimpse of the armed guards?
I've been saving my old Pepsodent tubes
for the past two years, just waiting for some
thing like this to come along. Now they tell
me that irium doesn't mean "have a ticket."
Someone even discouraged me from trying to
get a ticket with grandpap's old discharge pa
pers. (He had reached the rank of major, before
the Salvation Army finally discovered that he
had been embezzling funds.)
Since it would be impossible to get the en
tire studenfc body in the Med Aud—curses be
to the architect who planned the place minus
chandeliers —the least that Hope could do is
spread out the several celebrities in his show.
Frances Langford could take care of the Mem
Aud crowd, Jerry Colonna could lecture to the
campus janitor association, and Hope could ra
diate in the chintzy room of the Women's Club
house.
Or even better, why not let the Tuesday Se
ries lecturer have the stage, and move the en
tire Hope show up to the boat house. The deck
would make a good stage, and the place is
equipped with a spot light. The audience could
float in the lake bed on little clumps of sea
weed, and thus the crowd would be narrowed
down to those with a sincere 'interest in the
show.
Since the boat house season hasn't officially
opened, though, we'd better go back to the
main issue. The Bob Hope show is being held
in the Mem Aud, before an audience of Navy
men and veterans.
Considering what Stanford and the Red and
White Ball did in the way of starting Skinnay
Ennis out on his career, you'd think that he'd
make some sort of arrangement for getting the
remainder of the student body into the show.
They should be able to use something in the
way of a stage crew, a couple of people to pull
the curtains for station identification, and a few
props for the little boxes on either side of the
auditorium. Then there should be a flock of
concessioners going up and down the aisle,
whipping up plate lunches.
I know darned well that if this show were
being put on by some true gentleman like Mr.
Flynn, distribution of tickets would be different.
It's really not that we're bitter about the
whole thing, it's just that the tubes in our ra
dios are burned out.
