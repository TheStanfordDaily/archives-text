# Campus Opinion
## SHOT IN THE ARM 
### 
Dear Editor:
Although the spirit was willing at the Cal
game Friday night, the songs and cheers were
decidedly weak. The cheer leaders did the
best they could with the little material at hand,
but the cheers were hackneyed and very high
schoolish. Our supply of songs and yells is
threadbare, not to say moth-eaten.
The Farm needs a shot in the arm! We pro
pose an all-campus cheer and song contest with
a suitable reward for the best. This is the cue
for all loyal Stanford students to put some
punch into our team support.
Let's see some action!
Sincenerly,
B.S. V.H.

BOLLIKAWOLLIKA!
Dear Editor:
Please, kind editor, reveal to us poor defense
less knowledge seekers the name of the "orig
inality kid" who coined the horrible phrase,
and we quote, "Bollikawollika the Bears," so
that we might contribute our tidbit to humanity
by ridding our "beloved campus" of this
scourge.
We humbly confess that we have no inkling
of what the word (?) "bollikawollika" means,
and doubt that many of our fellow students do
either. Nevertheless we are of the opinion that
this term is slightly off the beam and a dese
cration of the famous Stanford publicity. Terms
like bash, bop, bump, or boot, we think, would
be much more fitting to the occasion than bolli
kawollika.
All we ask is his name so that we and he may
rest in peace.
Bollikawollika yours,
Ray Pascoe

(Editor's note: After a little snooping around,
we discovered that "Bollikawollika the Bears"
was cooked up by Rally Com to arouse spirit
for Stanford's basketball contest with Cal. and
the word "bollikawollika" comes from the song
"Chickery Chick" and appears in the little jum
ble of double talk featured in that song. In past
years similar phrases have appeared before ath
letic contests such as "Booger the Cougar,"
"Conko the Bronco," and "Ruin the Bruin." Main
purpose they are expected to serve, according
to Rally Com Women's Head Patty Whittemore,
is to get a laugh from puzzled Stanford students
trying to figure out just what the words mean.
And frankly, we like the idea. Wc laughed.)
