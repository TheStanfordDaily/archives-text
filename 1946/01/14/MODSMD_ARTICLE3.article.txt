refusing to cross picket lines of striking Western Electric employees.

Arthur Hall, ÜBTW secretary
treasurer reiterated the union's in
tention to knock out city dial ex
changes "in five or 10 minutes" by
putting 250 union members to work
jamming the exchanges with an ov
erload of calls. The threat depended
upon whether or not the union voted
to take formal strike action of their
own.
ÜBTW members now are respect
ing picket lines of the Association of
Communications Equipment Work

vote taken Friday and Saturday to
determine if they will join the
ACEW.
A spokesman for the Pacific Tele

out with overload calls but said the
exchanges would return to normal
just, as soon as the overload was
stopped. Hall declared, however,
