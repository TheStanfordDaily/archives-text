ALL-STAR STANDINGS
Several months ago, this column
printed its all-star band. Since
then, the three major music mag
azines have come out with the
results of their polls. The results
were very gratifying except for
j a few instances, and in the case of
Downbeat, band leaders were de
clared ineligible. Therefore, such
instrumentalists as Coleman Haw
kins. Gene Krupa- and Benny
: Goodman were not named as
