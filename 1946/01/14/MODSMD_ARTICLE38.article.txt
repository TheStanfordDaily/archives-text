A few days back there appeared a
schedule of the Stanford basketball
team for this season. As sometimes
happens on even the best of news
papers, there appeared an error.
According to the Daily, Coach Ev
erett Dean's basketball hoopsters
were hooked up to engage both the
U.C.LA. Bruins and their cross
town rivals, U.S.C., on the same
night. Now that is all wrong. Fol
lowing is the correct schedule of the
Cardinal basketball team for the
rest of the season:
Jan. IS and 19—U.C.L.A. (here)
Jan. 25 and 2(i—l T .S.C. (here).
Feb. 1 — College of the Pacific
(here)
Feb. 2—University of San Fran
cisco (here)
Feb. X and !)—U.C.L.A. (in Los
Angeles
Feb. 15—California (Berkeley)
Feb. I<»—California (here)
Feb. 22—Santa Clara
Feb. 27 —University of San Fran
cisco (Civic Auditorium)
Intramurals Start
This week the intramural pro
gram gets under way on the cam
pus. A serious effort has been made
to improve the caliber of intramu
ral play with the introduction of the
basketball "clinic"' "doctored" by
Coach Dean, varsity basketball
coach. Another weak point in the
past set-up of the intramural has
been the mediocre officiating. This

will also be corrected, as prospective
officials will also be instructed at
the basketball "clinic."
Last quarter the gridiron intro
mural schedule started off with a
tremendous amount of enthusiasm,
but when Marchie Schwartz issued
the call for varsity fqotball a good
number of intramural teams had to
default because of lack pf players,
who donned varsity togs.
This quarter intercollegiate
sports shouldn't interfere with the
intramural program. The number
of male students has greatly in
creased (jump in glee, you girls)
this quarter, and there are enough
students to have a good casaba
league. The various teams are fe
verishly preparing for the hot
league race that will ensue, and
from inside reports we understand
that Harrison Hall will really field
an excellent team. Nothing short
of sensational, the boys say.
Student interest, or rather, stu
dent turnouts, for past games have
been low, and it is time that more
students support the intramural
teams around the campus.
Mentioning basketball officiating a
few paragraphs back reminds us of
the refereeing during our series
with California this week-end. Both
upholders of the rule book, Bob
Britt and Lloyd Leith, to our way
of thinking were just too darned
sticky with technicalities. Particu
larly the first half of the Friday
game, when a Stanford man was
called for charging when another
player accidentally pushed him into
the Cal man.
Officials can steal the show
without being so technical. A
good example of this is John Olds,
basketball referee in Los Ange
les. who is also a sports writer for
the Los Angeles Herald and Ex
press. Every time Olds calls a
foul, he goes through a ''song and
dance" act that no professional
thespian could beat, but he sure
is a hell-of-a-lot better officiator
than anyone in the Bay area.
