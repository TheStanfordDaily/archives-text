## Head Boxing Coach Now Back on Farm 
### STU MILLAR 
Vic Lindskog is back on the Farm. 1
After playing football for a sea
son with the Philadelphia Eagles j
professional outfit, Stanford's all
coast center and near All-Ameri
can has come West to the head box
ing coach's desk. He will also as
sist Marchie Schwartz prepare the
Card conference football team next !
fail.
A pretty fair exponent of the fis
tic art himself, Vic is more than
equipped to bring along the boxing I
team. Although he was never al
lowed to take part in intercollegiate
tussles because of an obscure con- !
ference ruling, Vic fought as an \
amateur frequently and with great !
i success.
I'm not sure what arrangements '
will be made for Stanford's return
to competition in this particular
sport," Lindskog said. "I haven't |
seen more than a few experienced
boxers on the campus since I ar
rived here, but it's a hard pull back i
for any team that has been defunct !
for so long a time."
Boxing Tourney
In an effort to bring out any hid
den talent that might be unnoticed. !
the athletic department will spon- [
sor an all-University tourney in
February. Due to this, an invita- !
tion by California for the 15th of
February has been turned down.
As assistant coach of the gridders,
Vic will help bring aolng the for
wards on Stanford's full-fledged
conference grid team next fall. He
hasn't seen much of the material
with which he will work except
through viewing the movies of last
fall's two contests.
"I know a few of the fellows—

! Supple. Tyler, and Altus—but I'm in
| no position to make predictions as
j to how we'll do. Right now our big
j ge.st trouble is finding good players
with good grades," said the rugged
j 205-pounder.
Talking about his experiences
during the last few months, Vic
; said, "The records might show that
we only finished second in our
| part of the league, but as far as I'm
| concerned we wore the best team
in the whole nation."
Eagles Lost to Giants
And that remark isn't all team
spirit. The records also show that
Vic and his fellow Eagles twice
I humbled the Cleveland Rams, the
team that ultimately won the nJf-
I tional title. The demise of the Ea
j gles was a definite one. It can be
j traced to the fourth quarter of the
New York Giant game when, with
the Eagles ahead by the comfortable
score of 21 to 0. the New Yorkers
threw four straight touchdown
! passes over Steve Van Buren.
The Eagle name is practically a
! misnomer. Playing alongside Lind
! skog were Fred Myers and Bruno
Banducci of the now fabulous Stan
! ford '41 Rose Bowl footballers. And
| if- he goes to the pro wars—some
■ thing Vic isn't sure about yet—he
j might find another ex-teammate in
Eagle uniform, for Pete Kmetovic
i has been drafted by that team.
All-League Honors
Although comparatively new at
I the play-for-pay game, Vic more
than held his own back East. He
recenved all-league honorable men
tion honors as did Banducci, who
Vic claims v/as by far the outstand
ing lineman in the circuit.
Inevitably the question about Bob
; Waterfield and A 1 Benton, the ter-
I rifle scoring combination of the
Rams, came up. And Vic goes right
along with the crowd. "They're
good," he said. "This Benton is
really a great pass receiver. He
compares favorably with Don Hut
son. Although he doesn't have the
fakes and tricks of Hutson, he sure
catches the ball when it's near him.
Lindskog isn't exactly a novice at
j coaching either. During last autumn
he coached a Philadelphia prep
school with more than a fair amount
of success. His charges would have
copped the championship except for
I one of those ever-present flukes
1 that lose ball games for teams that
; deserve io win.
