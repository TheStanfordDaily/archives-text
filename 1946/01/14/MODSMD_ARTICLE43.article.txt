Showing outstanding improve
ment over a period of 24 hours,
Stanford's junior varsity basket
ball team almost topped the Cali
fornia Blues in the second of their
two encounters last week-end.
Led by their tall, high-sprinaing
forward, Walker, the Blues walked
away from the local hoopsters on
Friday night. The visitors piled up
an early lead and coasted to a 39
to 18 win against disorganized Card
quintet.
But nothing much better could
have been expected from the Stan
ford team. It was the first time
that over half of the whole squad
had ever donned the red. Arms,
Hughes, and Loomis of the first
string and Shoup, who started on
Saturday night, had just entered
school and were playing together
for the first time.
Therefore it was a real surprise
when on Saturday night tliey re
bounded to lead for most of the
contest only to lose in the last
three minutes because of some
sensational shooting by Nugent
and Walker of the Blues.
Most of the credit for this per
formance can go to Coach For
est "Fordy" Anderson, who, by
changing the Farm -team's offen
sive style and by tipping his play
ers to Cal weaknesses, greatly
increased the effectiveness of most
of the Cards.
The second night saw Jack Wood,
most experienced member of the
junior squad, shift from guard to
center where he became an im
portant cog in the offensive strategy
and gave the team much-needed
backboard strength.
But the easily outstanding man on
the floor both nights was Walker of
Cal. He made a cohesive unit of the
team in addition to tipping in a good
percentage of his team's rebounds.
Of the Stanford team. Wood,
Arms, and Rosehill all looked
good in the second game. "Itosie"
sank several shots in key mo
ments to quell Cal rallies. Arms
, did yeoman backboard service
besides dropping four nice shots
in the first half. Shoup played the
best defensive game on the team.
