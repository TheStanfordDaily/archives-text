# Cal On Top, Price Loses
## 
### 
| California won the Indian - Bear 1
I basketball game Friday night but
j the Cal coach, Nibs Price, lost his
I own individual skirmish.
The Price episode occurred in the
second half, when Cal had already
[ taken a long lead over the Indian,
j Up to that point the Stanford root
! ing section had been very irritated
| by the officiating from the floor.
After decision after decision had
■ been called against Stanford, the
Indian rioting section responded
i with a yell for the black and white.
Soon after that, during play under
the California basket, Price became
disturbed from the bench by some
thing that had happened on the
j floor.
In his own remarkable vocabu
i lary, Price yelled something to the
| referee, Lloyd Leith, that Leith
■ didn't appreciate. Leith called a
technical foul on the Bears to which
I Price responded with some more
| of his wide choice of words. Leith
then called a second technical foul
j on the Bears.
The Indian rooters rose in a mass
to boo Price sitting on the bench.
Captain Bill Christiansen of the
Indians calmly walked up to the
free throw line and sank both of
his shots to the delight of the Stan
ford fans.
