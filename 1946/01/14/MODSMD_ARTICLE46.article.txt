(This is the second in a series

basketball teams.—Editor's note)
The year 1931 was a last-place
year for the Curd cage squad, but
(hiit year also witnessed the begin
ning of a long string of teams which
were to put Stanford in the national
spotlight. The Farm had not had a
successful basketball team in nine
years, and the campus looked to its
new coach, John Bunn, to get them
out of a serious rut. Bunn, who had
come to Stanford from the Uni
versity of Kansas, introduced a new
style of play which was to carry fu
ture Stanford teams, paced by Hank
Luisetti, to cage supremacy.
The Indians dropped their first
two games to U.C.L.A. and their
third to U.S.C., but came back to
defeat Sam Barry's Trojans, 28-21,
for their first conference win.
Beat the Bears Is Motto
Stanford's goal for the year was to
win the Cal series. The Cardinals
had not won a series from the Bears
since 92, and had not threatened
them in any tilt for five years. In
a hair - raising, over - time game,
Stanford defeated the highly touted
Blue and Gold, 157-32. Captain Mike
Reynolds, at center, and guard
Vance Fawcett paced the victors in
a game which saw Stanford trail
ing, 20-16, at half-time.
The following week Coach Bunn's
squad took a last-minute, 29-28 vic
tor y over the Bruins of U.C.L.A. to
place them in a tie for second place
and leave them still a title con
vender.
A defeat from S.C. dropped the
Indians from the title race, but left
them hopeful of taking the Cal se
ries. Coach Nibs Price's Cal five
stopped these hopes with two lop
sided victories that ended the sea
son. The Cards dropped the first
game 37-14 and wound up the sea
son the following night with a 40-32
victory. The victories gave Cal the
Southern Division championship
and the right to meet the Wash
ington Huskies for the coast title.
Team Gains Respect
For the season, Stanford won
three and lost six Conference
games. Despite this record, the
Farm had finally produced a team
which had the respect of the rest
of the Southern Division, and in two
more years Coach Bunn's new cage
tactics were to pay off with the most
feared teams on the West Coast.
High point man for 1931 was for
ward Phil Moffat; other standouts:
captain and center Mike Reynolds
and speedy guard Vance Fawcett.

A defeat from S.C. dropped the
Indians from the title race, but left
them hopeful of taking the Cal se
ries. Coach Nibs Price's Cal five
stopped these hopes with two lop
sided victories that ended the sea
son. The Cards dropped the first
game 37-14 and wound up the sea
son the following night with a 40-32
victory. The victories gave Cal the
Southern Division championship
and the right to meet the Wash
ington Huskies for the coast title.
Team Gains Respect
For the season, Stanford won
three and lost six Conference
games. Despite this record, the
Farm had finally produced a team
which had the respect of the rest
of the Southern Division, and in two
more years Coach Bunn's new cage
tactics were to pay off with the most
feared teams on the West Coast.
High point man for 1931 was for
ward Phil Moffat; other standouts:

The year 1931 was a last-place
year for the Curd cage squad, but
(hiit year also witnessed the begin
ning of a long string of teams which
were to put Stanford in the national
spotlight. The Farm had not had a
successful basketball team in nine
years, and the campus looked to its
new coach, John Bunn, to get them
out of a serious rut. Bunn, who had
come to Stanford from the Uni
versity of Kansas, introduced a new
style of play which was to carry fu
ture Stanford teams, paced by Hank
Luisetti, to cage supremacy.
The Indians dropped their first
two games to U.C.L.A. and their
third to U.S.C., but came back to
defeat Sam Barry's Trojans, 28-21,
for their first conference win.
Beat the Bears Is Motto
Stanford's goal for the year was to
win the Cal series. The Cardinals
had not won a series from the Bears
since 92, and had not threatened
them in any tilt for five years. In
a hair - raising, over - time game,
Stanford defeated the highly touted
Blue and Gold, 157-32. Captain Mike
Reynolds, at center, and guard
Vance Fawcett paced the victors in
a game which saw Stanford trail
ing, 20-16, at half-time.
The following week Coach Bunn's
squad took a last-minute, 29-28 vic
tor y over the Bruins of U.C.L.A. to
place them in a tie for second place
and leave them still a title con
