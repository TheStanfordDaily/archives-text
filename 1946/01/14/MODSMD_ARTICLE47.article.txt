# Baseball Practice Starts; Over Forty Men Report
## 
### 
At the first meeting of the Stan
ford l>ascl>all team last Monday,
Coach Harry Wolter was greeted
by over forty face*, all but three
of which were new to him. Since
the Indians have not participated
in intercollegiate baseball since
19415, Wolter is faced with a prob
lem that confronts 110 other coach
in the league.
Wolter has as assistant this year
the top man on his 1942 team, Ray
Hammett. Ray was the top first
sacker in the league that year as he
his a lusty .400, and fielded bril
liantly around' the initial sack. Be
sides baseball he played quarter
back on the football team.
It is way too early to get a line
on the team. The boys have been
out only a week, and have spent
that time merely running around
the field to get into condition. Wed
nesday the first batting practice was
held, but no great hitting has taken
place as yet. Second base is the
most popular position with ten boys
out for the keystone bag. Most of
the forty men are civilians, but
there are seven from the Navy R. 0.-
T.C., and about ten veterans. Coach
Wolter says that his battery is in
the best shape at the moment. He
has four pitchers, two of whom have
had varsity experience, and three
catchers out for practice.
Of the three lettermen, Carl
Kellenberger seems to bo the
shining star. He was the regular
centerfielder four years ago, and
turned in many great plays. The
other two are both right-handed

pitchers. They are Phil Wolfe and
Dick Flatland. The rest of the
squad is inexperienced, and only
time will tell whether they will
be up to pre-war caliber.
St. Mary's and Santa Clara, two
of the pre-war conference members,
have not signified whether they will
return to the diamond sport this
year or not. Regardless of whether
they return or not, however, they
will not be in the conference. Prac
tice games will be arranged with
them if they do return.
The regular schedule was worked
out at a meeting held last Decem
ber 11, and will include the same
four teams as the basketball sched
ule does. Four games will be played
against all three schools for a grand
total of twelve. The conference race
does not get under way until next
quarter. By that time there might
be some more returned lettermen
to bolster the squad. This is what
we are all hoping for!—Steinmetz

T.C., and about ten veterans. Coach
Wolter says that his battery is in
the best shape at the moment. He
has four pitchers, two of whom have
had varsity experience, and three
catchers out for practice.
Of the three lettermen, Carl
Kellenberger seems to bo the
shining star. He was the regular
centerfielder four years ago, and
turned in many great plays. The
other two are both right-handed

pitchers. They are Phil Wolfe and
Dick Flatland. The rest of the
squad is inexperienced, and only
time will tell whether they will
be up to pre-war caliber.
St. Mary's and Santa Clara, two
of the pre-war conference members,
have not signified whether they will
return to the diamond sport this
year or not. Regardless of whether
they return or not, however, they
will not be in the conference. Prac
tice games will be arranged with
them if they do return.
The regular schedule was worked
out at a meeting held last Decem
ber 11, and will include the same
four teams as the basketball sched
ule does. Four games will be played
against all three schools for a grand
total of twelve. The conference race
does not get under way until next
quarter. By that time there might
be some more returned lettermen
to bolster the squad. This is what
we are all hoping for!—Steinmetz
At the first meeting of the Stan
ford l>ascl>all team last Monday,
Coach Harry Wolter was greeted
by over forty face*, all but three
of which were new to him. Since
the Indians have not participated
in intercollegiate baseball since
19415, Wolter is faced with a prob
lem that confronts 110 other coach
in the league.
Wolter has as assistant this year
the top man on his 1942 team, Ray
Hammett. Ray was the top first
sacker in the league that year as he
his a lusty .400, and fielded bril
liantly around' the initial sack. Be
sides baseball he played quarter
back on the football team.
It is way too early to get a line
on the team. The boys have been
out only a week, and have spent
that time merely running around
the field to get into condition. Wed
nesday the first batting practice was
held, but no great hitting has taken
place as yet. Second base is the
most popular position with ten boys
out for the keystone bag. Most of
the forty men are civilians, but
there are seven from the Navy R. 0.-
T.C., and about ten veterans. Coach
