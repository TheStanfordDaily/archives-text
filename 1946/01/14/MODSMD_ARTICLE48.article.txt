# Art Exhibition Reveals South American Trends
## 
### 
The exhibit of Latin - American
au t now on view at the Stanford Art
Gallery shows the dominant trends
and tendencies found to the south
ward. Although there has been a
growing interest in Latin America
during the past few years, its art is
still very little known, explained
Grace L. MeCann Morley, director
of the San Francisco Museum of
Art, who arranged this exhibit.
There are twenty-nine paintings,
representing the work of artists of
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Guate
mala, Mexico, and Peru. They show
various mediums, including water
color, oil, duco, dry point wood cut,
gouache, and lithograph. There arc
also eight mounts which contain re
productions of representative pic
tures and explanation of back
ground and outstanding personali
ties in the art movements of the
various countries.
Mexico Best Known
"Mexico alone among the Latin
American republics is somewhat
known by its art in this country,"
Dr. Morley said. "This has some
times served as a barrier to under
standing art of the other countries.

Many, expecting it to fit the famil
iar Mexican pattern, have been baf
fled by the differences and variety."
Dr. Morley added that the exhibit
shows not a unity in Latin-Ameri
can art, but a rich diversity. Mexi
can and Peruvian artists have been
greatly influenced by the great In
dian civilizations which flourished
in their regions before the coming
of the Spaniards. In the more tem
perate countries such as Chile, Ar
gentina, and Uruguay, art follows
more closely the prevailing art
trends of Europe. Cuba and Brazil
have some African influence al
though it is less pervasive than in
their music.
French Influence
The Latin - American artist is
really an amateur, Dr. Morley said,
because there is almost no market
for paintings in South America.
Because there are no good school or
museums in their own countries,
most of them go abroad for their
education, consequently their work
is greatly influenced by French art.
The best - known artist whose
work is included in the show is
Diego Rivera, the Mexican fresco
painter. Jose Clemente Orozco and
David Siqueiros, also leaders in the
Mexican movement, which was the
first to take shape in the Western
Hemisphere, also have work shown.
The exhibition will be on view
until Jan. 20. The gallery is open
week days except Monday from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays from
1 to 5 p.m.
