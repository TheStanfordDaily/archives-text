# Auto Workers OK Board Proposals
## 
### 
DETROIT. Jan. 13 (UP).—Lead
ers of 175,000 ClO-United Auto
Workers on strike against General
Motors, today voted to accept Presi
dent Truman's fact-finding board's
proposal to end the walkout with
19.5 cents an hour increase in wages.
However, the 200 representatives
attending a national conference of
striking locals said that their offer
to settle for a raise of 19.5 cents an
hour must be accepted by General
Motors by Jan. 21 or the union would
revert back to its original demands
of a 30 per cent increase.
Walter P. Reuther, UAW vice
president and director of the union's
General Motors division, said, "We
are not asking General Motors to
bargain on the basis of the 19.5 cents
an hour pay increase proposal. It is
now up to President Truman to sell
his panel's report to General Mo
tors."
The conference announced its
proposal, which would end the 54-
day-old walkout against the coun
try's largest industrial empire, after
three and one-half hours of delib
eration.
General Motors President C. E.
Wilson flatly rejected the fact-find
ing board's suggestion, which is six
cents above the auto company's last
proposal of a 13.5 cents an hour in
crease.
Company spokesman said there
probably would be no statement
forthcoming immediately concerning
the union's new stand.
It was the first time since negotia
tions started that the UAW has
shown any inclination to reduce its
wage demands.
