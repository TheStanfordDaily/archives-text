BUFFALO, N.Y., Jan. 13 (UP).—
Payment of unemployment benefits
to veterans in struck plants was de
manded here by a picket line of
veterans which paraded for two and
a half hours before the New York
State unemployment insurance of
fices yesterday.
The pickets, who were members
of the CIO Veterans' Committee,
termed present conditions "a rank
piece of discrimination" and called
upon Gov. Thomas E. Dewey "to
set aside part of the $400,000,000
postwar reconstruction funds for
veterans in struck plants."
"Under the GI Bill of Rights, the
payment of adjustment allowances
to veterans unemployed because of
a strike or labor dispute is barred,"
George W. Poole, a former Air
Corps corporal and head of the
picket line, explained. "We con
sider this a rank piece of discrimi
nation that should be amended at
once by Congress. If this is what
' we fought for we don't like it."
