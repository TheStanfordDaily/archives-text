# Moscow Conference Shows Power Politics Trend--Buck
## 
### MARY ANN McCOMB 
The most obvious result of the
Moscow Conference, according to
Philip W. Buck, professor of politi
cal science, is the substantial gain
in the recognition of the differences
of opinion and purposes of the Big
Three nations.
In all probability more arrange
ments were made at the conference
than have been made public. Ofli
cial releases imply more than they
actually contain, but even the in
formation for the public indicates
this recognition of differences.
CONCESSIONS MADE
An example of this is the con
cession to the Russian insistence
that their attitudes to the Central
European states be recognized more
fully. Mr. Buck states that frhis con
cession was made because Russia's
attitude does not appear as dan
gerous now as it did a short while
ago. The other powers were will
ing to recognize it as a result of
what has been happening recently
in those Central European states.
In Austria a conservative party
won an election, and in Rumania
there was a similar occurrence. This
looked at first like a repudiation of
Russia. But actually it seems to
indicate that Russia didn't have
these countries completely under
their control, and didn't intend to
do so. The elections demonstrate
that Russia was not pressing exces
sively in maintaining influence in
these Central European states.
ATOM CONTROL
Another aspect of the Moscow
Conference was the indication of
the fairly united effort of the Big
Three to keep the atom bomb under
control. At least they agreed on
the procedure to be followed. The
recommendation called for a com
mission in relation to the assembly.
This satisfies the "Big Powers" be
cause it guai'antees them positions

on it. This step may not. prove suf- |
ficient for satisfactory handling of i
the atom bomb problem, but it is at j
least a beginning.
There was also a large psycho- j
logical gain as a result of the con- j
ference. The participants were
more friendly. Subjects upon which j
no agreement could be reached be- ;
fore were considered more coolly at !
this meeting.
POWER POLITICS DANGER
in one respect this conference was
disturbing, according to Mr. Buck.
This fault lies in the fact that meet
ings of this kind perpetuate the
idea of, a few big powers which are j
making decisions that affect the â– 
whole world. The ideal would be a j
general international organization
set up as soon as possible and put
to work as fast as possible. This
would get us away from the idea of
a"Big Three" or a "Big Five" in
charge of the affairs of the world.
If a United Nations Organization is
put in charge, the more powerful
nations may still be running the
affairs of the world, but at least it
won't be qui,te so evident.
The longer the big nations take
upon themselves the responsibility
of settling difficulties, the less
chance there will be. for a world
organization to succeed. While the
big powers are doing the job, the
need for a world organization won't
be felt. But when the big powers j

become comparatively less power
ful, as they undoubtedly will, the
other nations won't be satisfied with
their dominance, according to Mr.
Buck.
UNO REPRESSED
The situation is such that the Big
Three may be said to be in compe
tition with a United Nations Or
ganization. The League of Nations
failed because the big powers ef
fected special arrangements in set
tling disputes between nations in
stead of working through the
League. The less active the League
became, the less important a general
organization of the world seemed.
The Big Three concept also is an
invitation to the "balance of power"
idea. In that sense the Moscow
Conference had a bad effect. How
ever, according to Mr. Buck, a
United Nations Organization, or
ganized and put into effect soon
enough, would be at least a partial
corrective.
