## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13 (UP).—
The Congress of Industrial Organi
zations charged tonight that the
congressional Pearl Harbor inquiry
is Republican campaign strategy
aimed at "confusing the voters"and
an attempt to smear the name of the
late President Roosevelt.
In a letter to committee chairman
Sen. Alben W. Bark ley, CIO legis
lative director Nathan Cowen de
manded that the investigation be
dropped so that the five Senators on
the 10-man committee can do "their
duty to the people who elect them."
On Tuesday the committee will
hear the testimony of Adm. Hus
band E. Kimmel, who lost his job
as naval commander and much of
his fleet as a result of the Dec. 7,
1941, tragedy. He will be given his
first chance in more than four years i
to state his side of the case.
Blamed by Navy Department offi
cials here for negligence in perfor
mance of his duties, he is expected
to testify that Washington did not
keep him advised of the mounting
strain in U.S. - Japanese relations
just before the war.
The CIO letter charged that the
inquiry was preventing the Senate
from "carrying on its constitutional j
function of legislating for the gov
ernment of this nation."
