# 2 Orchestras Open Places To Students
## 
### 
Two orchestras, under the direc
tion of Jan Popper, associate pro
fessor of music, are open to Stan
ford students this quarter. The first,
or general orchestra, is a seminar
for the study of symphonic master
works, and is open to all students
with no trvouts required.
The second orchestra is a per
forming group, and consists of
picked members who have passed a
severe tryout. At present it is com
plete except for one French horn
and one trumpet player.
The general orchestra, which
meets Mondays at 7:15 p.m. in the
Art Gallery, is now studying
Haydn's "Clock Symphony," and
will learn Gershwin's "Rhapsody in
Blue" and several other classical
and modern works before the end
of the quarter. This group has sev
eral openings for trumpets, trom
bones, and French horns, and also
has one bassoon with no one to
play it.
The performing orchestra, which
meets Thursdays at 7:15 in the Art
Gallery, is learning the score to the
Mozart opera "The Magic Flute,"
which will be given here the first
week of March.
