WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (UP).—The State De
partment announced tonight that an inter-Allied
reparations agency has been established in
Brussels and in February will begin dividing
German reparations among 18 nations, exclu
sive of Russia and Poland.
The latter nations already have taken over
German capital and industrial assets as their
share.
The announcement coincided with publica
tion of the full text of the Paris reparations
agreement signed last Dec. 21. It also was re
vealed that the victorious powers still are un
able to make an estimate of Germany's dis
tributable wealth.
Total claims against Germany range from j

$750 billion to $1 trillion. For that reason, rep
arations are to be distributed on a pro-rata basis
rather than on a global value basis.
United States claims total $200 billion based
on "budgetary" expenses. These include ship
ping losses and such imponderables as loss of
life and wated national effort. This nation is to
draw 28 per cent of Germany's assets abroad
and 11.8 per cent of German shipping and mov
able industrial capital equipment.
Unofficially, it is estimated that the United
States will actually receive only a fraction of 1
per cent of her total claims. Later, the United
States, France and Britain will have to pay the
reparations claims of Brazil and other Latin
American states from their share of German
assets.
