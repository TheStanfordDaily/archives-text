# No Triviality

Periodically we all get tied up over some
thing or other. The typewriters in the Daily
Shad: practically write the stories themselves;
a lot of little people make little speeches that
have been made before; and the sponsors over
in Encina and Roble disperse the word as they
see ii.
Tin., time we're not talking about a make
shift, tiadi'ion-for-tradition's-sake, or a triviality.
We're talking about the Honor Code, best
known Stanford tradition. Believing that this
year, with its influx of new students and its
proportionately large numbers of students living
off campus, is crucial to the future of the Honor
Code, we want to ensure that all Stanford men
and women understand how important this
phase of campus life has become to us since it
was established in 1921. Almost 25 years ago a
Daily editor, plugging the Honor Code's adop
tion, wrote that it mean that "every Stanford
graduate would be a better Stanford man, for a
four years' college course under a real honor
system, with actual student responsibility, is
conducive to the development of the character
of the man Stanford aims to graduate. It goes
without saying that men who work on their own
responsibility here, will be better able to work
on their own responsibility elsewhere."
But sometimes that point doesn't go without
saying. You have to say it loud, because it's
one definite long-range reason why we support
such a code. The short-term view is in terms of
the personal integrity, mutual and self-respect
which are the natural outcome of working under
such a system day by day.
The Honor Code is now considered an appli
cation of the Fundamental Standard to academic
work; it is defined in article X of the A.S.S.U.
Constitution as an undertaking of the students
indivdually and collectively pledging:
1. That they will not give or receive aid in
examinations; that they will not give or receive
unpermitted aid in class work, in the prepara
tion of reports, or in any other work that may
be used by the instructor as the basis of
grading.
2. That they will do their share and take an
active part, in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves obey the spirit and the letter of the
Honor Code.
Organized primarily to perpetuate the system
and to keep it under continual study for im
provement, the Honor Code Standing Commit
tee is now under the joint chairmanship of Jane
Irwin and Tom Howard. Their program in
cludes plans to make the code understood and
accepted whole-heartedly by all new members
of the A.S.S.U., as well as those who have al
most forgotten how long ago they first signed
the bluebook pledge which meant that they
shared in keeping a tradition that's actually
more than worth the speeches, the printed
words, and our real concern.—N.S.

of the man Stanford aims to graduate. It goes
without saying that men who work on their own
responsibility here, will be better able to work
on their own responsibility elsewhere."
But sometimes that point doesn't go without
saying. You have to say it loud, because it's
one definite long-range reason why we support
such a code. The short-term view is in terms of
the personal integrity, mutual and self-respect
which are the natural outcome of working under
such a system day by day.
The Honor Code is now considered an appli
cation of the Fundamental Standard to academic
work; it is defined in article X of the A.S.S.U.
Constitution as an undertaking of the students
indivdually and collectively pledging:
1. That they will not give or receive aid in
examinations; that they will not give or receive
unpermitted aid in class work, in the prepara
tion of reports, or in any other work that may
be used by the instructor as the basis of
grading.
2. That they will do their share and take an
active part, in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves obey the spirit and the letter of the
Honor Code.
Organized primarily to perpetuate the system
and to keep it under continual study for im
provement, the Honor Code Standing Commit
tee is now under the joint chairmanship of Jane
Irwin and Tom Howard. Their program in
cludes plans to make the code understood and
accepted whole-heartedly by all new members
of the A.S.S.U., as well as those who have al
most forgotten how long ago they first signed
the bluebook pledge which meant that they
shared in keeping a tradition that's actually
more than worth the speeches, the printed
words, and our real concern.—N.S.
Periodically we all get tied up over some
thing or other. The typewriters in the Daily
Shad: practically write the stories themselves;
a lot of little people make little speeches that
have been made before; and the sponsors over
in Encina and Roble disperse the word as they
see ii.
Tin., time we're not talking about a make
shift, tiadi'ion-for-tradition's-sake, or a triviality.
We're talking about the Honor Code, best
known Stanford tradition. Believing that this
year, with its influx of new students and its
proportionately large numbers of students living
off campus, is crucial to the future of the Honor
Code, we want to ensure that all Stanford men
and women understand how important this
phase of campus life has become to us since it
was established in 1921. Almost 25 years ago a
Daily editor, plugging the Honor Code's adop
tion, wrote that it mean that "every Stanford
graduate would be a better Stanford man, for a
four years' college course under a real honor
system, with actual student responsibility, is
conducive to the development of the character
of the man Stanford aims to graduate. It goes
without saying that men who work on their own
responsibility here, will be better able to work
on their own responsibility elsewhere."
