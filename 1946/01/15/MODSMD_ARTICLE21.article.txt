### STANLEY WILSON 
One of the better gags concerning the beard
less youth of Stanford came to us recently by
way of a returning veteran who had spent sev
eral ragged years at the Farm before his tour of
duty in the service.
It seems my friend was busy unpacking his
belongings the first night of the guarter, and he
overheard some of his neighbors talking down
the hall. As far as he could figure out the fellas
were discussing the point system. Since my
friend had just been discharged via this route,
he decided to introduce himself to the group,
compare sea stories and find out just what
theater of war the boys had been in.
After the introductory remarks, my friend
asked the young looking group how many
points they had. All of them varied around 10
and 12. Amazed, my friend who had racked up
quite a score for himself, decided to get to the
bottom of it and find out just what senators the
boys knew.
After much talking and misunderstanding,
my friend realized that the youngsters weren't
talking about discharge points at all. They ex
plained their point system as one which worked
over the Christmas holiday season, in which
they each received one point for every girl they
had kissed. . . . Shades of the Stanford rough!!!!
My next little fable of the week concerns the

open house and tea thrown by the Row women
for Roble last Sunday. The idea of the whole
thing was to acquaint the frosh women wiih the
small living groups so they could make an in
telligent choice come next Spring.
As far as we know it all went well with the
exception of one house. Three Roble neophytes
entered one of the houses, took one look
around, and without further ado, asked if the
house had a sun porch. The answer was "no,"
and without hesitation the Roble belles replied,
"sorry" and headed out of the house. The last
we heard they were scampering down the Row
while the house women vainly tried to call to
them that the Lake was only two blocks away.
My sympathy goes out to you, girls. After all,
a house without a sun porch is almost as frus
trating as a bar that's run out of beer. But I
might add that on the fifth floor of Encina there
are some vacant rooms, and the western expos
ure . . .

A little sophomore girl who furnished me
with a nice bit a news last quarter has come
through again. This time the pretty little lass is
in love. Yep, it's the real thing. The man of
her heart is in the navy, and in order to keep
things squared away here at home while he's
away, the guy hung his pin on our subject.
Lacking an anchor to hang around the gal's
neck, he sent along his high school Hi-Y pin.
But, realizing Stanford tradition, this campus
queen knew that high school pins on Quad
were frowned upon. So, not to let her boyfriend
down, and to cooperate with the edicts set down
in the Frosh Bible, she found a way to handle
the whole situation.
Just about bedtime most every night you can
see our girl toddling off to bed with a tremen
dous Hi-Y pin hung on her bathrobe. Of course
I can't say for sure about this, but it comes from
a reliable source. But I'll see what I can do to
verify it.

neck, he sent along his high school Hi-Y pin.
But, realizing Stanford tradition, this campus
queen knew that high school pins on Quad
were frowned upon. So, not to let her boyfriend
down, and to cooperate with the edicts set down
in the Frosh Bible, she found a way to handle
the whole situation.
Just about bedtime most every night you can
see our girl toddling off to bed with a tremen
dous Hi-Y pin hung on her bathrobe. Of course
I can't say for sure about this, but it comes from
a reliable source. But I'll see what I can do to
verify it.
One of the better gags concerning the beard
less youth of Stanford came to us recently by
way of a returning veteran who had spent sev
eral ragged years at the Farm before his tour of
duty in the service.
It seems my friend was busy unpacking his
belongings the first night of the guarter, and he
overheard some of his neighbors talking down
the hall. As far as he could figure out the fellas
were discussing the point system. Since my
friend had just been discharged via this route,
he decided to introduce himself to the group,
compare sea stories and find out just what
theater of war the boys had been in.
After the introductory remarks, my friend
asked the young looking group how many
points they had. All of them varied around 10
and 12. Amazed, my friend who had racked up
quite a score for himself, decided to get to the
bottom of it and find out just what senators the
boys knew.
After much talking and misunderstanding,
my friend realized that the youngsters weren't
talking about discharge points at all. They ex
plained their point system as one which worked
over the Christmas holiday season, in which
they each received one point for every girl they
had kissed. . . . Shades of the Stanford rough!!!!
My next little fable of the week concerns the

open house and tea thrown by the Row women
for Roble last Sunday. The idea of the whole
thing was to acquaint the frosh women wiih the
small living groups so they could make an in
telligent choice come next Spring.
As far as we know it all went well with the
exception of one house. Three Roble neophytes
entered one of the houses, took one look
around, and without further ado, asked if the
house had a sun porch. The answer was "no,"
and without hesitation the Roble belles replied,
"sorry" and headed out of the house. The last
we heard they were scampering down the Row
while the house women vainly tried to call to
them that the Lake was only two blocks away.
My sympathy goes out to you, girls. After all,
a house without a sun porch is almost as frus
trating as a bar that's run out of beer. But I
might add that on the fifth floor of Encina there
are some vacant rooms, and the western expos
ure . . .

A little sophomore girl who furnished me
with a nice bit a news last quarter has come
through again. This time the pretty little lass is
in love. Yep, it's the real thing. The man of
her heart is in the navy, and in order to keep
things squared away here at home while he's
away, the guy hung his pin on our subject.
Lacking an anchor to hang around the gal's
neck, he sent along his high school Hi-Y pin.
