# HISTORY -1946

### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
It seemed momentarily that the nation's labor
troubles could end where they began, in the
General Motors dispute. The presidential fact
finding board recommended a 17 Vz per cent
wage increase. The union accepted it. The
company, however, turned it down.
TURNDOWN
But why did the company turn down the rec
ommended increase? It couldn't argue that th«
fact-finding board which recommended it was
unfair. The panel was appointed by Jesse Jones,
one of the more conservative leaders in Wash
ington. If anything, his men would favor the
company.
Also, General Motors couldn't say that the
percentage arrived at was unreasonable. The
management had previously offered its work
ers 10 per cent, while the union held out for 30.
Thus the employers were asked to give only
IVz per cent, while the union had to come down
12'/ 2 .
STATEMENTS
Further in regard to the recommendation be
ing unreasonable, the fact-finding board that
made it worked from GM financial statements.
If the company argues that the increase is too
much, it will have to admit cheating its own
stockholders, in which case it deserves much
more.
What seems to be going on is a war to the
finish. Under the present corporate tax laws,
GM makes money by not producing anything
during the 1945 period of the strike. Further, if
the trouble continues through 1946, GM can
apply for a rebate on its last taxes egual to a
normal year's profit.
Nevertheless, it would be cheaper in the
long run for the company to keep operating.
The organization would be kept intact, and the
machinery would be kept up and kept in use.
However, if the union treasury can be shat
tered by prolonging the strike, and the work
ers have to take whatever the company decides
to give them, the money going to GM directors
and not to automotive workers might be worth
the price of prolonged idleness.
WORKER'S RIGHTS
Despite the fact that GM keeps many men
employed supplying raw materials to the com
pany and goods and services to the workers,
despite the fact that it is a key to the industrial
economy, a strike is going on that is paralyzing
it. The basis of our thought is and should be
that the workers in an industry deserve the
highest wage compatible with that industry's
intake and expenses. That wage has been de
termined impartially, and the company has re
fused to pay it. This is one time when the "Sov
ereign prerogatives" of free enterprise, which
were supposed to work to the benefit of the
whole community, are only working to the
benefit of a few. If this keops up in other in
dustries, capitalism and the country are in
danger, and, so long as they cannot prove that
turned-down wage increases are unfair, it will
be, paradoxically enough, because of the capi
ta list«.

Thus the employers were asked to give only
IVz per cent, while the union had to come down
12'/ 2 .
STATEMENTS
Further in regard to the recommendation be
ing unreasonable, the fact-finding board that
made it worked from GM financial statements.
If the company argues that the increase is too
much, it will have to admit cheating its own
stockholders, in which case it deserves much
more.
What seems to be going on is a war to the
finish. Under the present corporate tax laws,
GM makes money by not producing anything
during the 1945 period of the strike. Further, if
the trouble continues through 1946, GM can
apply for a rebate on its last taxes egual to a
normal year's profit.
Nevertheless, it would be cheaper in the
long run for the company to keep operating.
The organization would be kept intact, and the
machinery would be kept up and kept in use.
However, if the union treasury can be shat
tered by prolonging the strike, and the work
ers have to take whatever the company decides
to give them, the money going to GM directors
and not to automotive workers might be worth
the price of prolonged idleness.
WORKER'S RIGHTS
Despite the fact that GM keeps many men
employed supplying raw materials to the com
pany and goods and services to the workers,
despite the fact that it is a key to the industrial
economy, a strike is going on that is paralyzing
it. The basis of our thought is and should be
that the workers in an industry deserve the
highest wage compatible with that industry's
intake and expenses. That wage has been de
termined impartially, and the company has re
fused to pay it. This is one time when the "Sov
ereign prerogatives" of free enterprise, which
were supposed to work to the benefit of the
whole community, are only working to the
benefit of a few. If this keops up in other in
dustries, capitalism and the country are in
danger, and, so long as they cannot prove that
turned-down wage increases are unfair, it will
be, paradoxically enough, because of the capi
ta list«.
It seemed momentarily that the nation's labor
troubles could end where they began, in the
General Motors dispute. The presidential fact
finding board recommended a 17 Vz per cent
wage increase. The union accepted it. The
company, however, turned it down.
TURNDOWN
But why did the company turn down the rec
ommended increase? It couldn't argue that th«
fact-finding board which recommended it was
unfair. The panel was appointed by Jesse Jones,
one of the more conservative leaders in Wash
ington. If anything, his men would favor the
company.
Also, General Motors couldn't say that the
percentage arrived at was unreasonable. The
management had previously offered its work
ers 10 per cent, while the union held out for 30.
Thus the employers were asked to give only
IVz per cent, while the union had to come down
12'/ 2 .
