# Crosby Stars In Revival
## 
### 
SING YOU SINNERSâ€”Now play
ing at the Stanford Theater
Bob Hope's companion in flip
pancy, Bing Crosby, has a story that
his lazy, easy-

going nature in
Paramount's re
lease li Sing You
sinners," a film
of 1938 vintage
that stacks up
surprisingly well
with modern
day fare.
Bing has one
grand time in
Sing You Sin-

ners." He takes out his brother's
best girl and gets fried, refuses to
work, goes to Santa Anita and
cleans up, opons a swap shop, trades
it for a race horse, and makes a
bucketful of money when his horse
breezes home a winner.
Mingled with the above fluff, Bing
manages to sing some socko tunes,
among them "Small Fry" and "Got
the Moon in My Packet." Also
present in the affable cast are Fred
Mac Murray as Eing's serious broth
er and Donald O'Connor, in his first
role, as a tough little jockey.
Even the most severe cinceynic
should be pleased by "Sing You
Sinners." It's as engaging a picture
as you could expect to see and
shows Bing Crosby back in the days
before he became the big star he is
today.
The second picture, "The Adven
tures of Marco Polo," finds Gary
Cooper stranded in China in the
days of Kubla Khan, not knowing
what to do wiih his role of the
adventurous Mr. Polo. Unfortu
nately he acts like a country yokel
lost in a dime-a-dance joint on
Mission Street.
Alan Hale, is terribly miscast as
a guerilla chieftain and Basil Rath
bone scores the only effective per
formance as a blackguard who
keeps a den of leopards under a
trap door in his living room. It's
a shame most of the cast didn't dis
appear via ihis route.
Lana Turner appears in a bit role
that made the boys in the front row
sit up and take notice. Sec if you
can spot her.- Dick Bower
