TOKYO, Jan. 14 (UP).â€”Chief Cabinet Secre
tary Wataru Narahashi called upon all Japanese
political parties today to make a vigorous con
test of the forthcoming national elections for
the house of representatives in order that bal
loting will reflect fully the public will.
Narahashi asserted that the outstanding task
of Premier Baron Kijuro Shidehara's reorganized
cabinet will be to prepare for fair elections.
"I am saying to Progressive, Liberal, Social

ist, Communist and other political parties to
fight hard and try to obtain a majority in the
forthcoming elections because, if the winners
are really representative of the people's will,
government control will be given to them,"
Narahashi said.
Shidehara's cabinet was reorganized during
the weekend as a result of Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur's recent directives purging imperialist
figures from public life. Five cabinet members
and a deputy cabinet secretary were droppd.
