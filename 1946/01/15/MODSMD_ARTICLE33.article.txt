# 'Y' to Resume Open Houses
## 
### 
Everyone is invited — both men
and women — to the traditional
Y.W.C.A. open houses to be held
again this quarter every Wednes
day afternoon from 3 to 5 in the
"Y" social rooms upstairs in the
Women's Clubhouse.
These open houses were a well
known tradition ;it Stanford before
the war, and were revived last
quarter. According to Betty Wel
lington and Betsy Wilson, co-chair
men of the social committee in
charge, everyone who came enjoyed
himself, and the informal atmos
phere provided a good opportunity
for students to get acquainted.
