Stanford's new Intramural Athletic Program had its official
debut last night when Coach Everett Dean held his basketball
"clinic" in the Pavilion.
This "cilinic" opened a new era in the campus intramural
sports program which its sponsors hope will be the best yet at
Stanford, and one that will be a lasting and improving one.
Many intramural activities which were dropped at the begin
ning of the war, and many that were traditions at Stanford years
ago are being embodied in this new program. Not only basket
ball is on the intramural schedule this uarter but also track and
field meet between houses and other organizations. There are
also going to be a number of interclass events including an Irish
Marathon, swimming, golf, wrestling, gymnastics and topping
of the program will be the All-University Boxing Championships.
The sponsors of this program, A 1 Masters, Husky Hunt, Ever
ett Dean, Marchie Schwartz, Jack Weirshauser, Harry Wolter,
Elwyn Bugge, and Gene Coldiron, hope that this program will
provide competitive athletic recreation for every student who
vanst it*. In their program they have realized that many students
would like to participate in the varsity sports but for some reason
canno.
All the program now needs is the support of the students. The
committee is doing everything in its power to make this program
a success, so let us give them our support and make the program
a success.
SUPPORT THE BASKETBALL TEAM
Stanford's basketball team, like the football team, will not be
back to its pre-war power for another year or two. Many students
in the light of this will fail to support our athletic teams properly.
When a team is riding high it doesn't need the students' sup
port as much as a team that is having a tough uphill climb. It is
the duty of every Stanford student to support the basketball team
to the fullest. Don't let the team down. They are doing their
best to hold up the honor of the Farm. Everyone will follow a
winning Indian team, but only the loyal Stanford men and women
v/ill stick to a losing team. Let's see a lot of students at every
basketball game throughout the season.
