# Swim Team Looks Good
## 
### 
Now that Clinton Eastman and
Rey Rule, aces of the '42 varsity
team, are back on the campus,
Coach Ernie Brandsten is going
ahead with plans to definitely field
a swimming team this quarter.

Several newcomers have also
pleased Coach Brandsten and his
associates, Tom Haynie and My
ron Sprague. And although he
isn't doing any title talking, it is
obvious that Brandsten is more
than contented with his material.
Bob Anderson, who holds inter
scholastic titles in the 40- and 100-
yard freestyle races, has already
turned in some brilliant times in
practice, a 52.6 s. century included.
Don Hester and Frank Goulette,
breaststrokers, are among the out
standing prospects.
Others who will be in competition
for varsity berths are Warren Arm
strong, John Semer, Doug Goulden,
Bob Eschweiler, Fred Rodenbaugh
and Harry Borchers.
