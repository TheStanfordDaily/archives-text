# Red Men Get Ready For UCLA
## 
### 
Rocked back on their heels and
reeling from the 1-2 punch two
week-ends in a row, the Injuns an
swer the bell for round three Friday
and Saturday playing host to the
U.C.L.A.'s winless wonders both
nights at the basketball pavilion.
Lineup Not Set
Still juggling the lineup in hopes
of coming up with a winning com
bination, Coach Everett Dean had
less reason to hang crepe as a re
sult of Cal's working over of "our
boys," largely because no losses in
personnel occurred.
Brightest note in the overall pic
ture —U.C.L.A. has lost its four con
ference contests to the same guys
that beat Stanford and invades the
Farm with the express purpose of
prolonging the local win famine—
is the return of Bill Christiansen to
the lineup.
Dean inserted "Chris" in the
game Friday night as a measure of
desperation after the Cards had
gone scoreless for 12 minutes and
trailed ignominiously by 19-2.
"Chris" and Meredith put the Farm
back in the game and made up the
difference between a team and five
guys named "Joe."

Shifts in Lineup
For the ensuing contests, Mur
phy may be shifted to center, re
placing O'Brien and King, both of
whom are willing, but need more
seasoning. At least, the Indians
seemed to function . more smoothly
when they had Martin and Chris
tiansen at guards. Murphy at cen
ter, and Meredith and Hill at the
forwards.
The Bruin has been bucking some
of the same kind of luck that has
plagued Stanford. Defending cham
pions of the Conference, they have
taken it on the button four times in
a row. The personnel problems of
Mentor Wilbur Johns paralleled
j those of Coach Dean, both teams
I having the permanency of familiar
faces on a Market Street tram at
5 p.m.
' Good Chance of Victory
If (he Bruins get hot, look out. So
far they have clicked only once
this season and were well on their
way to dumping Cal only to lose out
in the last minute. The Big Red has
not done as well, but the desire for
a victory is so great on both sides
that all pre-game calculations are
best left alone.

way to dumping Cal only to lose out
in the last minute. The Big Red has
not done as well, but the desire for
a victory is so great on both sides
that all pre-game calculations are
best left alone.
Rocked back on their heels and
reeling from the 1-2 punch two
week-ends in a row, the Injuns an
swer the bell for round three Friday
and Saturday playing host to the
U.C.L.A.'s winless wonders both
nights at the basketball pavilion.
Lineup Not Set
Still juggling the lineup in hopes
of coming up with a winning com
bination, Coach Everett Dean had
less reason to hang crepe as a re
sult of Cal's working over of "our
boys," largely because no losses in
personnel occurred.
Brightest note in the overall pic
ture —U.C.L.A. has lost its four con
ference contests to the same guys
that beat Stanford and invades the
Farm with the express purpose of
prolonging the local win famine—
is the return of Bill Christiansen to
the lineup.
Dean inserted "Chris" in the
game Friday night as a measure of
desperation after the Cards had
gone scoreless for 12 minutes and
trailed ignominiously by 19-2.
"Chris" and Meredith put the Farm
back in the game and made up the
difference between a team and five
guys named "Joe."

Shifts in Lineup
For the ensuing contests, Mur
phy may be shifted to center, re
placing O'Brien and King, both of
whom are willing, but need more
seasoning. At least, the Indians
seemed to function . more smoothly
when they had Martin and Chris
tiansen at guards. Murphy at cen
ter, and Meredith and Hill at the
forwards.
The Bruin has been bucking some
of the same kind of luck that has
plagued Stanford. Defending cham
pions of the Conference, they have
taken it on the button four times in
a row. The personnel problems of
Mentor Wilbur Johns paralleled
j those of Coach Dean, both teams
I having the permanency of familiar
faces on a Market Street tram at
5 p.m.
' Good Chance of Victory
If (he Bruins get hot, look out. So
far they have clicked only once
this season and were well on their
way to dumping Cal only to lose out
in the last minute. The Big Red has
not done as well, but the desire for
a victory is so great on both sides
that all pre-game calculations are
best left alone.
