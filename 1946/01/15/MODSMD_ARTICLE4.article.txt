# Warren Fights for Construction Budget
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 14 (UP). â€” Gov. Earl
Warren and a strong legislative bloc backed by
cities and counties groups were running a dead
heat tonight in the race for distribution of the :
state's postwar construction funds.
The assembly ways and means committee
at a highly controversial meeting voted unani- !

mously to recommend passage of the adminis
tration-sponsored $154,000,000 reguest after de
leting a provision that 534,000,000 of the sum
should come from a disputed $90,000,000 sur
plus. But this action came only after the com
mittee had voted 15 to 5 to report favorably the
eld bill which divides the. $9,000,000 egually
between cities and counties.
