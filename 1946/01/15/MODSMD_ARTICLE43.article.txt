### 
SEATTLE, Jan. 4 (UP).-A strike
of 1,100 Seattle bus drivers which
had forced 250.000 city residents to
walk, hitch-hike or stay home from
work since Friday, ended tonight
after a union membership vote.
All but 26 of the bus drivers
voted to resume service of city
transit lines by 5:30 a.m. (PST) to
morrow.
