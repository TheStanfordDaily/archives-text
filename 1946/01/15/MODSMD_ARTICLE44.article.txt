SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 14 (UP).
—The San Francisco Clippers of
the Pacific Coast Professional Foot- •
ball League will be the next coast j
team to gain a National League
franchise, it was disclosed here to- !
'lay.
Frank Ciraolo, owner of the
Clippers, wired his San Francisco
associates that the club lias signed
a working agreement with the
New York Giants of the National
League for 1940 and had sched
uled a game for the J !J47 season —
indicating that the local entry will
not gain admittance until that

The announcement from Chaolo
followed on the heels of the moving
of the Cleveland entry in the Na- [
tional League to Los Angeles, where j
it will compete for patronage j
against the new All - American
League entry in that city.
The San Francisco Clippers, like
nearly every other club in the Pa- |
cific Coast League, has lost money, j
since the start of the organization I
six years ago, up to 1945. This year, J
for the first time, most of the league j
members were able to come out on :
i the black side of the ledger.
If the Clippers gain admittance
to the National League in 1!!47, as
indicated, they will be faced by
! competition from the San Fran
cisco '4!)-ers (if the All-American
Conference, which swings into
i operation this coming fall.
Ciraolo's team will hold the key
i dates at Kezar Stadium (seating ca
capacity, 60,000) on a seniority ba
sis. The Clippers and their fore-
I runners, the Packers, have been
I playing pro ball there since 1939.

Ciraolo's telegram indicated that
the National League will not move
a team to San Francisco, as was the
case of the Cleveland shift to Los
Angeles. Rather, the Clippers
would take over th» franchise and
just move from the coast loop to
