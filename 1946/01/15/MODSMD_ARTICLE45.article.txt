# Net Squad Begins Drill
## 
### 
I Though still in the elementary
stage, Coach Bugge is gradually
i forming the nucleus of a tennis
| squad. Absent from the wars for
: some three years and without the !
I services of any returning letterjnen,
! Coach Bugge is faced with the task !
of fashioning a potent group of rac- ;
queteers to once' again enter into !
collegiate competition.
At present the aspirants for the ;
net squad are engaged in practicing [
fundamentals and developing their !
own net games. Challenging is the
fashion of the day with everybody
getting a crack at each other. Also
double combinations are being tried
i and tested.
Heisser Top Man
On top of the roost is Arnold
B .'isser, former College of Pacific j
| star, who shows nice form in work
! outs. Filling (he second slot is Gro
! ver Miller, recent participant in the
mixed doubles tourney. Filling up
the rest of the ladder are Dave Ba
sham, Gene Corman, Frank Dilling,
Jim Kopp, Tom Scofield, Ted Tay
lor, Rod White, and Frank Walker.
This ladder is subject to immediate
j change and may undergo drastic re
-1 vision before competition is actually
i.tarted.
Other contenders for the top spots
are John Frost and Bill Rutledge.
Frost is a •former P.A.L. doubles
champion, while Rutledge attended
Stanford in 1942 before being called
Ito the armed forces. Basketman
Jackson Woods, who hails from
i Oregon U., also will be a contestant
after the finale of the casaba season.
League Tournaments Uncertain
As yet no practice tussles have
been scheduled but Coach Bugge
plans to vie with the Palo Alto ten
nis squad in several scrimmages.
Boasting of several talented racket
men, the local townsmen will offer
' ample competition for the Indians.
Though no advanced- "info" has
reached us about the other confer
ence teams. Southern California and
U.C.L.A. with the cream of the crop
down south would do well in any
i body's league. Of course our cross
town Bear friends will also be there
to prevent any championship aspi
rations we might cherish. But after
some needed practice the Indian
, squad should be able to uphold
! their own on the courts. •

i forming the nucleus of a tennis
| squad. Absent from the wars for
: some three years and without the !
I services of any returning letterjnen,
! Coach Bugge is faced with the task !
of fashioning a potent group of rac- ;
queteers to once' again enter into !
collegiate competition.
At present the aspirants for the ;
net squad are engaged in practicing [
fundamentals and developing their !
own net games. Challenging is the
fashion of the day with everybody
getting a crack at each other. Also
double combinations are being tried
i and tested.
Heisser Top Man
On top of the roost is Arnold
B .'isser, former College of Pacific j
| star, who shows nice form in work
! outs. Filling (he second slot is Gro
! ver Miller, recent participant in the
mixed doubles tourney. Filling up
the rest of the ladder are Dave Ba
sham, Gene Corman, Frank Dilling,
Jim Kopp, Tom Scofield, Ted Tay
lor, Rod White, and Frank Walker.
This ladder is subject to immediate
j change and may undergo drastic re
-1 vision before competition is actually
i.tarted.
Other contenders for the top spots
are John Frost and Bill Rutledge.
Frost is a •former P.A.L. doubles
champion, while Rutledge attended
Stanford in 1942 before being called
Ito the armed forces. Basketman
Jackson Woods, who hails from
i Oregon U., also will be a contestant
after the finale of the casaba season.
League Tournaments Uncertain
As yet no practice tussles have
been scheduled but Coach Bugge
plans to vie with the Palo Alto ten
nis squad in several scrimmages.
Boasting of several talented racket
men, the local townsmen will offer
' ample competition for the Indians.
Though no advanced- "info" has
reached us about the other confer
ence teams. Southern California and
U.C.L.A. with the cream of the crop
down south would do well in any
i body's league. Of course our cross
town Bear friends will also be there
to prevent any championship aspi
rations we might cherish. But after
some needed practice the Indian
, squad should be able to uphold
! their own on the courts. •
