# Track Squad Short On Materialâ€” Weiershauser
## 
### 
If you are able to tell tin* (lif- |
ference between a track shoe and
a cross bar it's high time you j
stopped hiding your rare gift be
hind a bottle of beer. Whether
you know it or not, there is a
man on this campus who is ex
tremely interested in making your
acquaintance, lie is Coach Jack j
Weiershauser of track fame.
Quoth he, "If there is a man
around who can, or thinks he can,
do the 100-yard dash in under 10:2
or throw the javelin 1(10 feet or i
run the high hurdles in 1G flat, I
j hope he turns out."
These pages have been express
ing hopes, and plenty of them, re* |
j cently for a quick conversion of
j Stanford athletics to our pre-war
high standards. We hoped for the
j basketball squad to produce some
of the thrills of the '42 gang. We
J hoped for some of the old letter men
j to come back and bolster the inex
! perienced baseball team. And now

we're hoping again. This time it's
for a real track turn-out.
Two oidtimers who ran as frosh
back in '41 are out giving their all.
Their names are Bob Millington
and George Grimes and their are
holding up the weights and 880
events respectively. All other
events are wide open. So fellas,
come on and do your duty while
earning yourself a credit in P.E.
The official Pacific Coat I Confer
ence meet will not be held this year
although there probably will be
some sort of southern division com
petition arranged. Coach Weiers
hauser has announced that the
schedule will run something like
this: Fresno State, San Jose, Olym
pic Club, U.C.L.A., U.S.C., Califor
nia, West Coast Relays and a few
other dat'?s if thev can be had.
