# Post Office Facts Told By Supt. John Calahan
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
The most popular spot on campus
docs not offer comfortable seats,
soft lights, good food, or sweet mu
sic. In fact, the atmosphere is rather
dull, the decorating drab and mo
notonous, and the spot is under strict
government control. Yet more stu
dents visit the United States Post
Office, Stanford branch, each day
than the combined total of both Cel
lar and Western Civ library patrons.
Through the post office portals pass
the better part of the Stanford stu
dent body.
In 1900, Stanford post office be
came a branch, independent of the
Pulo Alto Post Office. However,
after forty-six years, many students
do not realize this fact. The main
complaint of the department is that
students neglect to inform their cor
respondents that they do not live in
the city of Palo Alto but at Stan
ford Universty. This oversight ac
tually delays mail as all mail ad
dressed to Palo Alto is first routed
to that town.
Approximately 8,000 letters arc
dispatchcd each day. while the in
coming mail also totals about
8,(100. This means that on the
average, each Slanlord student
should receive two letters per day.
The post office, however, disre
gards the quota system.
John Calahan, the present super
intendent, has his pet story about

his office. A few years ago a Stan
ford student had a pigeon which he
carried around on his shoulder. One
afternoon, the student, deciding to
partake of refreshments at the
Union, left his pet in his post office
box. There is a rule in the depart
ment that anything left in the box
must have sufficient postage at
tached. When the student returned
to reclaim his pigeon, he found his
pigeon on the scale, a clerk trying
vainly to attack postage stamps to
the poor bird's feathers.
The old timers in the post office
contend that it is a simple matter
to tell a novice in the department.
A new clerk, they say, will stack
mail by correctly holding the mail
in the palms of their hands the
thumbs over the top. However,
just as the clerk is assured that
he has mastered the feat, the let
ters inevitably cave in at the cen
ter.
The post office has requested that
all students who expect magazines
through the mail should fill out
Form 228. This form notifies pub
lishers of the subscriber's complete
address, and would be of immeas
urable aid in sorting the mail.
Letters are dispatched and re
ceived eight times a day by ten
clerks, some of whom are returned
veterans. Calahan stresses that 5:30
p.m. is the most advantageous time
to call for mail, for by that time all
mail deliveries have been made.

to reclaim his pigeon, he found his
pigeon on the scale, a clerk trying

the poor bird's feathers.
The old timers in the post office
contend that it is a simple matter
to tell a novice in the department.
A new clerk, they say, will stack
mail by correctly holding the mail
in the palms of their hands the
thumbs over the top. However,
just as the clerk is assured that
he has mastered the feat, the let

The post office has requested that
all students who expect magazines
through the mail should fill out

urable aid in sorting the mail.

In 1900, Stanford post office be
came a branch, independent of the
Pulo Alto Post Office. However,
after forty-six years, many students
do not realize this fact. The main
complaint of the department is that
students neglect to inform their cor
respondents that they do not live in
the city of Palo Alto but at Stan
ford Universty. This oversight ac
tually delays mail as all mail ad
dressed to Palo Alto is first routed
to that town.
Approximately 8,000 letters arc
dispatchcd each day. while the in
coming mail also totals about

John Calahan, the present super
intendent, has his pet story about

his office. A few years ago a Stan
ford student had a pigeon which he
carried around on his shoulder. One
afternoon, the student, deciding to
partake of refreshments at the
Union, left his pet in his post office
box. There is a rule in the depart

must have sufficient postage at
