bv Conference.
Miss Mary Yost, Dean ol Women,
awarded the Women's Conference
scholarship cup to Casa Ventura, the
living group with the highest schol
arship average for Autumn quarter.
Storey came second in the listing;
Adelfa, third; Eucalypto, fourth; and
Roble, Naranja, and Union Resi
dence tied for ffth place.
Conference voted last quarter to

have a scholarship cup which would
be awarded to the living group with
the highest average at the end of
each quarter. The name of Casa
Ventura will be the first on the cup.
Averages Computed
The Scholarship Steering Commit
tee and the Scholarship chairman in
each house computed the grade av
erages of each house by dividing
the units of work taken by the girls
in the house collectively by the col
lective grade points.
Miss Yost emphasized the impor
tance of good scholarship as a rec
ord of outstanding work which is

good for mental health. Intellectual
forces in life give stabilization to life,
and an intellectual chase never
stops being exciting. "From it we
we are able to tftll the difference be
tween the trivial and the transi
tory," she said.
She announced that 104 women in
lower division went on probation at
the end of Autumn quarter, and two
were disqualified. There arc 10'!
women that are between -1 and -6;
a total of 207 women have an aver
age below C. Forty-nine upper di
vision women went -1 or more at
the end of last quarter.
"The causes of these records is
primarily lack of motivation and
lack of backbone," Miss Yost said.
Many of these women have been on
probation for several quarters. "A
chronic probationist is not a happy
person. She doesn't like what she is
doing and is frustrated."
However, Miss Yost reported that
102 women received straight A's or
all A's and one B last quarter. These
women have learned the values and
interest in intellectual pursuits and
know why they arc going to Stan
ford, she said.
Conference members voted to
sponsor an informal jolly-up after
the basketball game with USC Fri
day, Jan. 25. The party will be no
date and open to the whole campus.
Refreshments will be sold, and the
money from these sales will go to
ward renewing the Women's Confer
ence scholarship.
Conference will sponsor another
jolly-up later on in the quarter with
games, dancing, and food. All money
from this party will also go for the
scholarship. No date has been set
for it yet.
There will be no house meetings
next Monday night because of the
Women's Voeom program at 7:15 in
the Cubberley Auditorium.
