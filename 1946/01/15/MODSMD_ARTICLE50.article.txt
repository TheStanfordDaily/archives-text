As major hostilities have ceased
in China, Chinese students are look
ing forward to closer cooperation be
tween their country and the United
States in exchanging both student
personnel and professors, according
to Dr. Shau Wing Chan, associate
professor of Chinese and Humani
ties.
"As soon as normal communica
tions between China and the Unit
ed States are restored," Mr. Chan
stated, "we may look forward to
Chinese students, especially, com
ing over to this country to work
for higher degrees here."
Mr. Chan pointed out that at the
present time the Chinese govern
ment is arranging for and setting up
scholarships in seven major Ameri
can universities to allow Chinese
students to study in the United
States. â€¢
"Stanford is one of these," Mr.
Chan said. The other six universi
ties include the University of Cali
fornia, Yale, Harvard, Columbia, the
University of Chicago, and the Uni
versity of Michigan. Five scholar
ships of $1,500 each are being offered
at these universities.
Mr. Chan urged any students in
terested in this exchange program
between the two nations to see
Professor A. E. Sokol, associate
director of the Pacific-Asiatic-
Russian program in the school of
Humanities.
In discussing the return of Chi
nese students to their own universi
ties which they were forced to evac
uate as the Japanese invaded then
country, Mr. Chan stated, "the major
universities are moving back to their
original campuses. This is the gen
eral tendency, and there is consid
erable planning to this end."
"Most of the students arc ex
pecting to get back to their old
campuses and universities in time

for the beginning of studies next
fall," Mr, Chan added.
Mr. Chan pointed out that some
of the universities are almost intact
while others have suffered destruc
tion during the war years. These
are in need of repairs and more
equipment.
''The National University of Pe
king in Peiping is definitely intact,
so far as I know," Mr. Chan declared.
Yenching University also in Peiping,
and Nankai University in Tientsien
are planning to open in the fall too.
Mr. Chan added that there are 133
"institutions of higher learning" in
China of which 39 are national uni
versities, 47 are independent colleges,
and 47 are technical colleges.
Concerning study conditons dur
ing the war Mr. Chan emphasized
the physical, mental, and intellec
tual privations and hardships
which Chinese students suffered.
"Lack of textbooks, lack of appa
ratus, and proper study environment
prevented the students from carry
ing on a normal study program," Mr.
Chan stated. "But the war years
matured them," he added. Mr. Chan
stated that the students in China
did everything to contribute to then
country "in effort though they could
not do much in the way of mate
rials."
In comparing the differences in
curriculum between Chinese and
American universities, Mr. Chan
declared that Chinese students did
not have so much time for extra
curricular activities as the aver
age American students have, and
that the academic work was hcav

ier. At the same lime the stu
dents take (lie same kinds of
courses in history, mathematics,
science, and languages.
''But the main thing now in the
minds of the Chinese students is to
get back to their old campuses and
their studies now that peace has re
turned," Mr. Chan said.
