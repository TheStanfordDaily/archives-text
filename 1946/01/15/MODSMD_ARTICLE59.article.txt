# Physics Exhibit On Display Today
## 
### 
An exhibit demonstrating Ber
noulli's Principle is now on display
in the Physics Building. Bernoulli's
Principle is: "In. regions where (he
velocity of flow is increased, the
hydrostatic pressure of the fluid is
less than in the surrounding fluid."
This explains the action of 'lift"
on an airplane wing, the "curve" on
a baseball, a carburetor, an air
speed indicator, a watermeter, 'an
"aspirator," an atomizer, and other
related phenomena.
