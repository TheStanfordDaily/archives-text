# Bob Hope Salaams Student Audience As 2,000 Roar Over Pepsodent Show
## 
### BETH MACVICAR MELLON SHELTON 
At Bob Hope's request to "break
this joint downâ€”you've had it long
enough," Stanford students respond
ed to the performance of the Pepso
dent. radio show in Memorial Hall
last night with roars of laughter (no
whistling allowed), and concerted
sighs from men and women respec
tively when Frances Langford and
Walter Pidgeon read their lines. So
enthusiastic was their response, in
fact, that Hope salaamed to his au
dience, waltzed about the stage, and
fervently kissed his script.
The entire show, including a plug
for Pepsodent, was directed at the
Stanford audience, who gullibly
agreed to "laugh at the jokes during
the broadcast, and figure them out
afterward." It takes Jive years to
graduate from Stanford, Hope said,
because with so huge a campus stu
dents waste one year walking across
the Quad.
Announcer Wendell Niles, Trudy
Irwin and "her sons" the Ilium
brothers, Skinnay Ennis and his or
chestra, globe-eyed Jerry Colonna,
and a sound-effects man that even
tually threw everything in sight
filled out the show's cast. The laughs
weren't all in the audience: Hope's
ad-lib choruses with Irium songs,
his ecstatic kicks, and his heckling
of Announcer Niles called forth grins
of bewilderment from the cast mem
bers.
The hair cut of one rough, sitting
in the orchestra pit with the Hope
labeled "stockholders," alarmed the
star. "Looks like it was cut on the
inside," he remarked, When a stu

dent in the front row started to
leave, Hope ushered him firmly back
to his seat. At his protest that, he
"had to go," Hope invited him up
onto the stage to amplify his state
ment. The man declined, however,
and remained seated. One coed, who
rose to leave when the broadcast
ended, was greeted by Hope holding
out a dollar bill pulled from a wad
in his pocket.
Following the broadcast proper,

! Trudy Irwin sang "More Than You
| Know." Colonna startled the stu
j dents and himself with a smooth
| chorus of "Time on My Hands" on
the trombone, and one loud chorus
| of "Road to Mandalay" and the fa-
I mous "Caroline."
He and Hope did a series of im-
I pressions: two fishermen, two farm
ers, two second lieutenants (who
j blew on each other's bars and pol
ished them as they passed each oth-
J er), and two Cola company presi
j dents who identified themselves with
lengthy belches into the microphone.
One impression of "two long-lost
brothers who haven't seen caeh oth
er for 20 years" ("Sad!" remarked
| Colonna) got off to three false starts
| and had the two comedians laughing
j so hard they almost didn't finish the
I stunt.
The auditorium was filled com
pletely except for the top row of
balcony seats. At 6:35, the double
line waiting to get inside stretchcd
from the door, around the oak-tree
hus stop, around the corner and
| down to the end of the block.
"It's good to see G. I. Joe wearing
corduroy pants and a pork-pie hat,"
j said Hope, " digging jive now and
| then instead of a foxhole, with his
| arm around a blonde once in a while
i instead of a Browning." His show
[ was dedicated to the veterans on
campus, in keeping with his wartime
| entertainment of servicemen in
| camps at home and bases overseas.
Hope and his cast did a show at
| Dibble Hospital yesterday afternoon
j before coming down to Stanford for
| the broadcast. They left within fif
teen minutes after the show, many
of them to return south overnight.
