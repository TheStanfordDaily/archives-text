(The following is a letter from
Mr. Walker to (He Stanford stu
dent l>ody.)
Mr. Robert C. Kennedy
Miss Charmian Kolar
Miss Betty Jean Calfee
Associated Students, Stanford Uni
versity
Dear Bob, Charmian, and Betty
.Jean:
Nothing could have pleased me
more than your letter which ap
pealed in the Stanford Daily yes
terday. Your kind .statement that I
have been of some assistance to the
student body affords me great hap
piness, and abundantly compensates
for the many difficult problems
which confronted Stanford and its
officials during the war years.
To have served the University
and to have known so many of
the students has been a rare priv
ilege, and I shall ever recall the
experience with keen pleasure.
I have long felt a warm affection
for Stanford students and the A.S.-
S.U. You may not know it but it
was my good fortune to serve as a
member of the Ex Committee dur
ing my sophomore and junior years
at Stanford and to be student body
president-elect in 1917, which office
I was unable to fill due to my en
listment in the Navy in World War
I. I felt grateful then for the confi
dence reposed in me by my college
mates, and do now for your cordial
commendation.
One of the finest things in Stan
ford history is the remarkable rec
ord achieved by the A.S.S.U. offi
cials in the matter of conducting
student affairs on such a dignified
yet pleasantly normal basis, and in
maintaining business and financial
soundness. This record of success
can be viewed with pride by all
Stanford men and women, past and
present, and from my own contacts
with you I know that the present
administration is worthy of its her
itage. As an alumnus I contemplate
Stanford's future with great confi
dence.
It has been a source of pleasure
to work with you and while my
official duties are about to ceasc I
want you to know that I will al
ways he at the disposal of the
A.S.S.U. whenever I can he of
help.
I send you and all Stanford stu
dents my fond regards and best
wishes for happiness in your Stan
ford days, and thereafter.
Sincerely yours,
Frank F. Walker
