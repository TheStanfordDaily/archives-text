Stanford women at 4:30 Thursday

Elizabeth Silen, Shirley Silen,
Coleen Marshall and Jackie Flan

Japanese prisoners in the Philip
pines for approximately thirty
seven months. The four women,
now registered as Farm freshmen,
will speak informally and answer
questions from the audience.
All four speakers graduated from
high school in Manila. Elizabeth
Silen completed high school the first
year of the war, while Shirley Silen,
Miss Marshall and Miss Flannery
finished three years of high school
in prison camp.
"All of our credits were burned
when the Japanese destroyed Ma
nila," explained Elizabeth Silen.
The families of all four girls,
also interned by the Japanese, are
now in the United States. The
Silcns returned from the Philip
pines, where Mr. Silen operated a
radio station in Manila May 15 of
last year. They now make their
home in Palo Alto.
The World Affairs committee of
the Y.W.C.A., under the chairman
