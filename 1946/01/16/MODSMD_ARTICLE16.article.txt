# Architect Gives Talk
## 
### 
A new concept of the house as a
fluid unit, designed from the cabin
up instead of from the mansion
down, was suggested by William
Wurster, architect, speaker at the
Tuesday Evening Series last night
in Cubberley Auditorium.
Mr. Wurster, dean of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
School of Architecture, in his talk,
'Your House," suggested a re-eval

of a house in which the season's
changes could be enjoyed by the
family while in the house. A glass
wall of the living room gave on an
other "room" which was open to the
sky.
Mr. Wurster showed slides of Cali
fornia houses which were designed
to give a maximum of sunshine and
enjoyment of the natural surround
ings.
Heating Methods
Another point emphasized by the
speaker was the great advance which
has been made in heating methods
and the importance of material in
heating is obvious. Radiant heating
which is done by heating the walls
and floor, is governed by the mate
rials used in the construction. He
said that, for instance, a five- or six
