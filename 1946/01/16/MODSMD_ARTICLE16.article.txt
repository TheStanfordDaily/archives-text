# Architect Gives Talk
## 
### 
A new concept of the house as a
fluid unit, designed from the cabin
up instead of from the mansion
down, was suggested by William
Wurster, architect, speaker at the
Tuesday Evening Series last night
in Cubberley Auditorium.
Mr. Wurster, dean of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
School of Architecture, in his talk,
'Your House," suggested a re-eval
uation of the house by going back
to a time before it became overlaid
with custom. A house then, he said,
was only something between man
and the weather.
Too Many Gadgets
Since then there has been an accu
mulation of detail and specialization
in the construction of houses, until,
today, many are absurd in the num
ber of gadgets they utilize.
War and economic conditions have
brought about a change and among
the new concepts of the various units
of the house which Mr. Wurster pro
posed were these: food preparation
as an integral function of the home;
24-hour use of the bedroom; porches
and balconies and glass walls for
more enjoyment of the outdoors.
Cheaper Houses
In discussing pre-fabricated houses
Mr. Wurster, who has supervised
the construction of a group of pre
fabricated homes at M.1.T., said he
hoped, and believed that the time
would comc when houses would cost,
not $5,000. but $3,000 to build.
Among slides, shown by the speak
er to illustrate his talk, were those
of a house in which the season's
changes could be enjoyed by the
family while in the house. A glass
wall of the living room gave on an
other "room" which was open to the
sky.
Mr. Wurster showed slides of Cali
fornia houses which were designed
to give a maximum of sunshine and
enjoyment of the natural surround
ings.
Heating Methods
Another point emphasized by the
speaker was the great advance which
has been made in heating methods
and the importance of material in
heating is obvious. Radiant heating
which is done by heating the walls
and floor, is governed by the mate
rials used in the construction. He
said that, for instance, a five- or six
foot-thick floor will hold heat much
longer than a thinner floor of a dif
ferent material, hence is more suit
able for climates which do not have
rapid changes of temperature.
Mr. Wurster expressed a prefer
ence for the one-floor plan of a
house, because of the many accidents
of which stairs are the cause.
Odd House
One slide shown by Mr. Wurster
as a diversion was a design of a
three-walled house. A fire place, an
ice-box, drawers, a sink, and even a
folding bed were built into a three
walled block to make a really "func
tional" house.
In answer to a question from the
audience following his lecture Mr.
Wurster said he believed that many
of the "archaic" laws governing
house construction could be dis
pensed with and building left much
more to the discretion of the archi
tect.
Introduction
Mr. Wurster was introduced by
Edward M. Farmer, associate pro
fessor of graphic arts and acting ex
ecutive head of the Department of
Graphic Arts.
Mr. Farmer announced that next
week's Tuesday Series lecture will
be on management and labor and
will be held in Memorial Hall.

changes could be enjoyed by the
family while in the house. A glass
wall of the living room gave on an
other "room" which was open to the
sky.
Mr. Wurster showed slides of Cali
fornia houses which were designed
to give a maximum of sunshine and
enjoyment of the natural surround
ings.
Heating Methods
Another point emphasized by the
speaker was the great advance which
has been made in heating methods
and the importance of material in
heating is obvious. Radiant heating
which is done by heating the walls
and floor, is governed by the mate
rials used in the construction. He
said that, for instance, a five- or six
foot-thick floor will hold heat much
longer than a thinner floor of a dif
ferent material, hence is more suit
able for climates which do not have
rapid changes of temperature.
Mr. Wurster expressed a prefer
ence for the one-floor plan of a
house, because of the many accidents
of which stairs are the cause.
Odd House
One slide shown by Mr. Wurster
as a diversion was a design of a
three-walled house. A fire place, an
ice-box, drawers, a sink, and even a
folding bed were built into a three
walled block to make a really "func
tional" house.
In answer to a question from the
audience following his lecture Mr.
Wurster said he believed that many
of the "archaic" laws governing
house construction could be dis
pensed with and building left much
more to the discretion of the archi
tect.
Introduction
Mr. Wurster was introduced by
Edward M. Farmer, associate pro
fessor of graphic arts and acting ex
ecutive head of the Department of
Graphic Arts.
Mr. Farmer announced that next
week's Tuesday Series lecture will
be on management and labor and
will be held in Memorial Hall.

A new concept of the house as a
fluid unit, designed from the cabin
up instead of from the mansion
down, was suggested by William
Wurster, architect, speaker at the
Tuesday Evening Series last night
in Cubberley Auditorium.
Mr. Wurster, dean of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
School of Architecture, in his talk,
'Your House," suggested a re-eval
uation of the house by going back
to a time before it became overlaid
with custom. A house then, he said,
was only something between man
and the weather.
Too Many Gadgets
Since then there has been an accu
mulation of detail and specialization
in the construction of houses, until,
today, many are absurd in the num
ber of gadgets they utilize.
War and economic conditions have
brought about a change and among
the new concepts of the various units
of the house which Mr. Wurster pro
posed were these: food preparation
as an integral function of the home;
24-hour use of the bedroom; porches
and balconies and glass walls for
more enjoyment of the outdoors.
Cheaper Houses
In discussing pre-fabricated houses
Mr. Wurster, who has supervised
the construction of a group of pre
fabricated homes at M.1.T., said he
hoped, and believed that the time
would comc when houses would cost,
not $5,000. but $3,000 to build.
Among slides, shown by the speak
er to illustrate his talk, were those
of a house in which the season's
changes could be enjoyed by the
family while in the house. A glass
wall of the living room gave on an
other "room" which was open to the
sky.
