### 
Recently enacted amendments to
the G.I. Bill of Rights and the Vo
cational Rehabiiltation Act pro
vide that "any person while on ter
minal leave, or while hospitalized
ponding final discharge, may he af
forded" the educational benefits of
the two laws "subject to all con
ditions in those laws except actual
discharge," Dean John M. Stalnaker
announced.
The amendments further provide,
however, "that no subsistence al
lowance shall be paid in such cases"

such men would still be receiving

ices.

sary for (he veteran to receive his
final discharge before beginning

Room 172, Ad Building.
