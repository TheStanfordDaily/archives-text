## The
						Fourth Freedom 
### 
A campus opinion letter addressed to the
Daily, and the subsequent comments of some
students who felt they were "in the know,"
have? shown us here at the Shack that there is
now some confusion as to whether or not free
dom of religion truly exists at Stanford, and if
so, to what degree.
"It has just been brought to my attention,"
I 1 is Jc: 1;r said, "that the informal meetings of
the Jewish, Catholic and Christian Science
groups are to be prohibited on the Stanford
campus. ... I am wondering if the "winds of
freedom," which have always been the life of
Stanford, have ceased to blow." In answer, we
testify that no such restriction has been made.
The sole restriction placed on religious
groups at Stanford is that none shall be given
to proselyting: that no advertising be shown or
pj -sure exerted upon the individual student to
joinr c group or attend a meeting. Consequent
rulings upholding this restriction are designed
to pr-vent absolutely competition for member
shin in religious sects through speeches, liter
ary campaigns or any non-religious allure
ments.
Members of any denomination may meet on
the- campus at any time provided their meet
ings are addressed to them personally; ar
rangement may be made with Mr. Tanner for
use c£ the Vestry for such meetings. No club
hou. , no favors will be granted by the Uni
versity to one group above another.
In giving the Memorial Church to the Univer
sity, Jane Lathrop Stanford wrote:
"The University must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basir. It must never become an instrument in
the hands of any political party or any religious
soct or organization. I believe that the moral
and religious development of the University
Will, be better accomplished if entirely free
from all denominational alliances however
slicj 1 t the bond may be."
Memorial Church offers religious worship
for all denominations without requiring profes
sion of faith or argument of theological ques
tions upon which sects may differ. If any re
striction on personal worship exists at Stanford
it is incompatible with the ruling of the found
ing grant, and will automatically, or by the
backing of the Board of Trustees, be abolished.
