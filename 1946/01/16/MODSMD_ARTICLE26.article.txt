"Yas, but
"What can we do?" The real question is not
what can you do, but what do you want to do?
Indifference is our big enemy. Banish indif
ference, experience shows, and we get insight.
Nothing is found without seeking.
That is where the mass of Stanford's students
stand in relation to the Atomic Bomb. The will
to respond to the new situation appears to be
missing.
So is not the case, however, v/ith. one group
of students. Having learned from life's expe
riences that they can do something they have
begun action upon the problem.
To thought such as this many students will
say, "Malarkey." Still others honestly will say
to themselves, "I want to do something all right,
but what is there to do?" . . . But are you able
eo say that to someone besides yourself- If
you can, and do, you have done something.
At that point you have begun to change, and
change being the essence of life, to live. In
fact, if you dare, you might even say how you
feel to this group of students. That would make
a big difference both to yourself and to them.
All of us want-to be somebody, don't we?
Yet the biggest thing you and I can ever be is
ourselves. Not another person is so well
equipped forf hat as you and I. And by our
failing to be that, the world is losing something
is might have had.
