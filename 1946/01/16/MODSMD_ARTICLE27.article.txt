Naturally I was plenty excited when I learned I
was to have an interview with Bob Hope. Who
wouldn't be? I understood that I was to meet him in
his dressing room after the show and walk with him
lip the Row where an open house was being held for
him and his cast.
I was a bit tied up during the half-hour show,

because I knew thai in a few minutes I would meet
the world's most brilliant comic. What would I say
to him? What would he say to me? Would I get a
glimpse of Frances Langford? All these thoughts
pounded in my mind like a trip-hammer. I hardly
remember now what went on during the broadcast.
Finally the show was over and I started toward
Hope's dressing room in the rear of the Memorial Hall.
I had a little- trouble getting in. True to the publicity
sent out by the Stanford Office of Information, there
was a ring of student police surrounding the Hope
sanctuary. After showing my I.D, card, my student
body card, my letter "S" sweater, and proof that I
voted the Republican ticket in the last election, the
gendarmes admitted me.
I had a tough time finding Hope's room, though.
I didn't know which one it would be. Finally I found
it. But I was bewildered. You see, the movie industry
has a habit of putting stars on the big name dressing
rooms. Well, the Memorial Hall dressing rooms are no
exception—at least now they aren't. My first glimpse
of Hope came when I saw him sneaking over to Walter
Pidgeon's dressing room, and erase the three stars on
the door. In a moment Walter appeared, put up four
on his door, and took off the six that Hope had hastily
put on his own. This went on for a moment or two,
when Hope said something about "professional jeal
ousy!!!" and disappeared in his room.
I cautiously knocked on his door, and I heard a
muffled sound. I presumed it meant for me to come
in. I might say my first view of Rob wasn't too im
pressive. He was leaning out the window passing
out autographed tubes of Pepsodent toothpaste, and
charging 1(1 cents over the ceiling price for each one.
Rut I excused him. 1 had heard of the poor theatri
cal people and their struggle to get ahead.
My first question was asked in order to see how
he enjoyed playing his show at Stanford. Hope re
plied: "I'm really not impressed with the crowd I drew.
I'm really not impressed with playing at a great Uni
versity such as this. The thing that makes me feel
humble and yet triumphant is the fact that I com
pletely loused up the Tuesday Evening Series sched
ule!!" . . . Your writer agreed with him.
But Bob was hurt about one thing. He had heard
that the tickets to his show had been thrown open to
the general student body yesterday morning and that
most of the ducats had been snatched up by Pidgeon
hungry coeds. He askqd something about "What does
Pidgeon have that I don't?" That's when all the
trouble started. Skinnay Ennis, who had wandered
into the room, answered him, and right now I can
tell you where you can g ( ,*t a swell dance band for the
next fireside for a very nominal fee. '
We walked up the Row together and had a very
nice chat. But I didn't think it very dignified of Bob
to keep whistling at all the girls riding by on bicycles.
As we approached the girls' house giving the recep
tion, Walter Pidgeon was just going in. At first we
only heard a wild series of screams, "Oh, Walter!!!"
and then all I remember is the beginning of a stam
pede. After Bob and I regained our feet, nursed our
bruises and dusted off our clothes, we rang the door
bell and asked us if we could come in too. Reluctantly
the house president admitted us, but it turned out to
be a one-man show. One might say a Pidgeon show.
My interview ended, I said "so long" to Bob and
took my leave. But I'll always feel sorry for him.
As I left I glanced back and there Bob sat—dejected,
forlorn, without a friend save the doting house
mother and a cup of tea balanced on his knee. I
could see a hurt, grim look on his face as he eyed
Pidgeon and bis coed harem. I'll always feel sorry
for Bob, because I know just how he feels.
