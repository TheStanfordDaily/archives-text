# HISTORY – 1946
## 
### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
Demobilization is so snarled up that it is ap
proaching a scandal. There are plenty of boats
overseas, and they are coming back half-filled.
Thousands of men are surplus. Nobody knows why.
Secretary of War Robert Patterson made a speech
to soldiers explaining things, and he didn't even know
how the point system worked. The War Department
first blamed it on ships, then on strikes, and now on
"a changing international situation."
ARMY MORALE
Army morale is justifiably low. It is impossible
to gauge the strain of one day under fire or the long
months of grueling training that prepared the soldier
for it. The point system deals with relatives. The
absolutes were the greatest of possible nervous strains,
and the men who endured them want to come home.
They were sensible enough to take everything the
Army had to offer when it was war. Everything had
a purpose, which was victory and salvation. Now,
those who are surplus, and for whom there is no use,
want to get out of the Army.
GRIPES SPREADING
These men are disgruntled about their unjust treat
ment. Their protests are hurting the spirit of those
troops who saw no action, and who were necessary.
The whole Army right now is suffering from ineffi
ciency because of the inexpert handling of demobiliza
tion.
A few men handling AMG, disposal of surplus
property, and intelligence are vitally necessary, and
it must be impressed upon them that they are until
they can be replaced.
It should seem that all combat veterans who want
to be should be discharged as soon as possible. Three
hundred thousand men. v/ith spirit and morale high,
looked over their life in the Army, decided that they
liked it, and re-enlisted. From this group could be
drawn the nucleus of a new Army.
REMOBILIZATION
The immobilization of these men would have to be
a factor. If more War Department time was spent on
this problem instead of on slupid excuses for why
thousands overseas are surplus, it could be solved eas
ily. Y< t the only potential enemy is the Russian, and
his taste for Army life is generally as low as ours right
now. True, he may be being propagandized to prepare
for war with the capitalistic states, but it may take
years to prepare him for it, and to get an atomic bomb
to counter ours with.
THE OCCUPATION
The occupation 'should be carried on by those who
have not served in war. It should be impressed upon
them that they did not see action, and that they are
needed now. If the whole conscripted pari of the
Army was of this type, it would bo better than having
combat veterans who deserve and demand to go horn".
SEECKT'S EXAMPLE
During the turbulent days of German politics in
the 1920'5, Von Seeckt, commander of the Reichswehr,
kept older in the country with 100,000 men and not a
single lank or airplane. We have plenty of these now,
and the men who would have to us? them wouldn't
need all the refinements necessary to fight an enemy
army.
With mechanization, occupation might indeed be
made an easier task. It could make demobilization
more complete. The Army as it stands now is in no
condition to police a country prnperlv, (hanks (o the
bungling stemming from the War Department. A
new, smaller Army with a new morale is needed,

tasks of 194<»,

THE OCCUPATION
The occupation 'should be carried on by those who
have not served in war. It should be impressed upon
them that they did not see action, and that they are
needed now. If the whole conscripted pari of the
Army was of this type, it would bo better than having
combat veterans who deserve and demand to go horn".
SEECKT'S EXAMPLE
During the turbulent days of German politics in
the 1920'5, Von Seeckt, commander of the Reichswehr,
kept older in the country with 100,000 men and not a
single lank or airplane. We have plenty of these now,
and the men who would have to us? them wouldn't
need all the refinements necessary to fight an enemy
army.
With mechanization, occupation might indeed be
made an easier task. It could make demobilization
more complete. The Army as it stands now is in no

Demobilization is so snarled up that it is ap
proaching a scandal. There are plenty of boats
overseas, and they are coming back half-filled.
Thousands of men are surplus. Nobody knows why.
Secretary of War Robert Patterson made a speech
to soldiers explaining things, and he didn't even know
how the point system worked. The War Department
first blamed it on ships, then on strikes, and now on
"a changing international situation."
ARMY MORALE
Army morale is justifiably low. It is impossible
to gauge the strain of one day under fire or the long
months of grueling training that prepared the soldier
for it. The point system deals with relatives. The
absolutes were the greatest of possible nervous strains,
and the men who endured them want to come home.
They were sensible enough to take everything the
Army had to offer when it was war. Everything had
a purpose, which was victory and salvation. Now,
those who are surplus, and for whom there is no use,
want to get out of the Army.
GRIPES SPREADING
These men are disgruntled about their unjust treat

troops who saw no action, and who were necessary.
The whole Army right now is suffering from ineffi

A few men handling AMG, disposal of surplus
property, and intelligence are vitally necessary, and
