# Dorm Saga Told; Ratio 527 to 244

### GEORGE ECKSTEIN LARRY FRANKLEY 
Encina Hull, constructed in 1895
and designed by an architect named
Hodges, has served as a Farm land
mark since the founding of the Uni
versity. Shaped in the form of a
"W," the edifice consists of two ma
jor parts, the inside and the out
side. Neither of these is encourag
ing to the Stanford neophyte, but
to the returning student it isn't very
encouraging either.
For the past two and one-half
years, Encina Hall has ejysted "half
slave and half free." That is to say,
the ASTP and ASTRP units occu
pied the west wing, one-half of the
entire structure, from May, 1943,
until the end of last quarter. Now
that the Army has retreated, all of
Encina is civilian, and Stanford
knows that the war is over.
It's Big, Too
The building consists of 244 rooms
and it now contains 527 men. This
is an average of two and 39/244 men
per room. As it is quite difficult to
fit two and 39/244 men in a room,
the residents are divided one, two,
and three to a room. Reaching a
height of five stories and a depth of
one basement, is the largest
of the living quarters on campus.
Originally meant for all men on
campus, Encina grew into a fresh
man dormitory with the enlarge
ment of the school. In 1917, as an
emergency measure, three men
were placed in each room, and it
seems that the emergency has ex
isted over the last 28 years as the

majority of the rooms still contain
three individuals.
In the old-fashioned days the En
cina men had lockouts, and this is
the reason for the never-used door
bell on the always-open door. May
be Roble's day will come, too.
From Soup to Nuts
The Encina Commons dining hall,
favorite eating place of food con
noisseurs the world over, was con
structed in 1923, replacing the old
dining hall that is now the Encina
Lounge. The Lounge, the most
modern of Encina's facilities, was
redecorated in 1942.
Chief adviser to the Encina men
is Dean of Men's Residences Stan
ley L. Sharp, whose office is located
on the first floor. He is assisted by
the Encina Council, which consists
of the resident assistant from each
floor. Luke Pitts, second-floor R.A.,
is acting chairman of this group.
Other organizations include Encina
Excom and a social committee.
Modern Conveniences
Rolling in the lap of modern con
veniences, Encina now has within
its confines a barber shop, a laun
dry, a drug store, a fountain, and a
game room. Telephone service is
adequate as compared to the ''good
old days" when there was only one
telephone in the entire hall. Most
of the rooms are a bit primitive in
regard to heat and electricity, but
the rooms are slowly being redone.
Under the suggestions and guid
ance of Frank Fish Walker, 27 of
the rooms have already been reno
vated, and plans are laid for the
remainder.
Familiar faces around the hall in
clude "Pete," the genial custodian;
Miss Inez Stevens, Dean Sharp's ef
ficient and likeable secretary; and
the all-seeing night watchman.
Be It Ever So Humble
Encina Hall will remain the place
on campus where old grads will
come after 25 years of absence, will
scratch their heads and say, "Well,
I'll be darned. It looks just the same
as when I was living here."

who tortured inmates of the noto
rious Belsen concentration camp.
Encina Hull, constructed in 1895
and designed by an architect named
Hodges, has served as a Farm land
mark since the founding of the Uni
versity. Shaped in the form of a
"W," the edifice consists of two ma
jor parts, the inside and the out
side. Neither of these is encourag
ing to the Stanford neophyte, but
to the returning student it isn't very
encouraging either.
For the past two and one-half
years, Encina Hall has ejysted "half
slave and half free." That is to say,
the ASTP and ASTRP units occu
pied the west wing, one-half of the
entire structure, from May, 1943,
until the end of last quarter. Now
that the Army has retreated, all of
Encina is civilian, and Stanford
knows that the war is over.
It's Big, Too
The building consists of 244 rooms
and it now contains 527 men. This
is an average of two and 39/244 men
per room. As it is quite difficult to
fit two and 39/244 men in a room,
the residents are divided one, two,
and three to a room. Reaching a
height of five stories and a depth of
one basement, is the largest
of the living quarters on campus.
Originally meant for all men on
campus, Encina grew into a fresh
man dormitory with the enlarge
ment of the school. In 1917, as an
emergency measure, three men
were placed in each room, and it
seems that the emergency has ex
isted over the last 28 years as the

majority of the rooms still contain
three individuals.
In the old-fashioned days the En
cina men had lockouts, and this is
the reason for the never-used door
bell on the always-open door. May
be Roble's day will come, too.
From Soup to Nuts
The Encina Commons dining hall,
favorite eating place of food con
noisseurs the world over, was con
structed in 1923, replacing the old
dining hall that is now the Encina
Lounge. The Lounge, the most
modern of Encina's facilities, was
redecorated in 1942.
Chief adviser to the Encina men
is Dean of Men's Residences Stan
ley L. Sharp, whose office is located
on the first floor. He is assisted by
the Encina Council, which consists
of the resident assistant from each
floor. Luke Pitts, second-floor R.A.,
is acting chairman of this group.
Other organizations include Encina
Excom and a social committee.
Modern Conveniences
Rolling in the lap of modern con
veniences, Encina now has within
its confines a barber shop, a laun
dry, a drug store, a fountain, and a
game room. Telephone service is
adequate as compared to the ''good
old days" when there was only one
telephone in the entire hall. Most
of the rooms are a bit primitive in
regard to heat and electricity, but
the rooms are slowly being redone.
Under the suggestions and guid
ance of Frank Fish Walker, 27 of
the rooms have already been reno
vated, and plans are laid for the
remainder.
Familiar faces around the hall in

Be It Ever So Humble
Encina Hall will remain the place
on campus where old grads will
come after 25 years of absence, will
scratch their heads and say, "Well,
I'll be darned. It looks just the same
as when I was living here."
