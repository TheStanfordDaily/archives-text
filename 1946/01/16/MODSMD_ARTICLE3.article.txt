## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP).—
President Truman revealed today
that the United States will ask the
United Nations Organization to
grant it sole trusteeship over Japa
nese-mandated islands needed by
this country.
He told a press conference the
islands he has in mind would be
kept under exclusive U.S. trustee
ship so long as they are needed.
He did not identify them but pre
sumably he referred to the Mar
shalls, Carolines and Marianas —
former German possessions man
dated to Japan by the League of
Nations after World War I.
This was the first official disclo
sure that the United States would
seek such a trusteeship. It grew out
of a press conference question about
an apparent division of opinion
among U.S. delegates to the UNO
conference in London over the
problem of Japanese mandates.
The President said that Japanese
islands not ( required would be
placed under UNO trusteeship, most
of them on a collective basis —oper-
ated by several nations. He pointed
out that all trusteeships would be
UNO Security Council.

SEOUL, Korea, Jan. 14 (UP).
—Secretary of War Robert Pat
terson said today that half of
the 807,000 U.S. troops in the
Pacific on Jan. 1 would be at
home or homeward bound by
May.
He told a press conference that
the overall demobilization policy
had not changed since Japan's sur
render and that he "docs not favor"
G.I. protest demonstrations in for
eign countries. He said soldiers
should pass their complaints
through the usual channels.
A committee of G.l.'s, represent
ing occupation troops in Korea, con
ferred with the Secretary and later
stated they were satisfied he had
been as specific as possible, under
the circumstances. They were par
ticularly pleased to learn that a
long-range plan is being formulated
in Washington so that each soldier
and officer would know how long
he is to remain overseas and in the
Army.
The four-man committee collect
ed $1,200 for an advertisement in
the Washington Post, protesting the
slow-up and stating they favored a
long-range demobilization plan and
continuation of the draft until ro
tation of all Army personnel is as
sured.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP).—
President Truman revealed today
that the United States will ask the
United Nations Organization to
grant it sole trusteeship over Japa
nese-mandated islands needed by
this country.
He told a press conference the
islands he has in mind would be
kept under exclusive U.S. trustee
ship so long as they are needed.
He did not identify them but pre
sumably he referred to the Mar
shalls, Carolines and Marianas —
former German possessions man
dated to Japan by the League of
Nations after World War I.
This was the first official disclo
sure that the United States would
seek such a trusteeship. It grew out
of a press conference question about
an apparent division of opinion
among U.S. delegates to the UNO
conference in London over the
problem of Japanese mandates.
The President said that Japanese
islands not ( required would be
placed under UNO trusteeship, most
of them on a collective basis —oper-
ated by several nations. He pointed
out that all trusteeships would be
UNO Security Council.

ing occupation troops in Korea, con
ferred with the Secretary and later

in Washington so that each soldier
and officer would know how long
he is to remain overseas and in the
