"No hooks, no speakers, no or- |
ganized gamesâ€”just a place to re- \
lax. drink a cup of tea and meet
your friends," said Betsy Wilson,
describing the weekly 3 to 5 "par
ty time" Wednesday afternoons in
the "Y" lounge.
Miss Wilson, with Betty Wellng
ton, heads the Y.W.C.A. social com- i
mittee that plans the weekly relaxa- !
tion lime.
"The 'Y' open house is the place i
for both Stanford men and women
to meet old friends or make new j
ones," continued Miss Wilson, as
she thumbed through a collection of
records available to students Wed
nesday afternoon.
"We usually find some students |
playing bridge in one corner, a i
couple just talking in another, a few |
students reading magazines, and j
others just eating," added Miss Wei- j
lington.
The Y.W.C.A. "party time" is a
weekly custom. The "Y" lounge,
on the third floor of the Women's
Clubhouse, is open to all who
care to relax from Wednesday
classes.
