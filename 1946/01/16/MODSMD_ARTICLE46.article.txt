A curre it fight that threatens to
reach th» proportions of armed
warfare i:, the current controversy
in the professional big top football
league. I l lt . National League, which
finally en tie p 0 } ler i itself solidly in
the cold Northeastern part of the
United 'st; t >s, has been watching
with av- e , nc j great sorrow, too —
the el borate preparations being
madt by the embryo All-American
Leagiie, which will field teams
touching the Atlantic and Pacific
Tnis new circuit has been laying
groundwork for their league
c,u .ring the war years, and plans to
HUrn out teams next fall. One of
Stanford's grid greats of a few years
■back figures in the San Francisco
entry in the infant grid league. He
is "Bones" Hamilton, who will serve
in an assistant coach's capacity.
Signed to play actively are Frankie
Albert, Hank Norberg, and Norm
Standlee, none of whom need any
introduction on this campus.
Plenty in (he Bank
The most necessary item—a bank
account—has not been lacking by
the backers of any of the new teams.
Money is being spent freely for
star players, and the National
League has claimed that some of
their players have been lured away
into the new circuit because of high
salaries offered. And you can't
blame any of the players. Football
playing foots the milk bill for the

kiddies, and—an Econ 1 maxim—
the fatter the check, the more milk
to gulp for Junior.
It is now evident, though, that the
senior circuit might snap out of its
lethargic condition and quit watch
ing its competitors grab all their
players, and all the headlines, too.
Elmer Layden has been dropped as
head mogul of the National League,
and in his place was elected Bert
Bell, live-wire owner of the Pitts
burgh football crew.
Another move the N.L. made was
influencing the Cleveland Rams to
move their franchise from the Ohio
city to Los Angeles. They will com
pete directly with Don Amache's
entry in the opposite circuit. There,
of course, is still another fool ball
team in the Southland area, the Los
Angeles Bulldogs, but an agreement
has been worked out between the
latter team and the newly trans
ferred Rams not to compete with
each other in clicking the turnstile, j
Coliseum Fight in L.A.
An interesting sidelight in the Los
Angeles scramble is the stadium
which will be used by the teams.
Neither of the major league teams
has definitely secured a spot where
the fans can watch their teams per
form, and the Bulldogs have been
using Gilmore Stadium in Holly
wood.
Both top-flight teams are in a
scramble to secure the big Coliseum
in*the City of the Angels. But U.C.-
L.A. and U.S.C., who now have ex
clusive contracts to fill the gridiron
saucer, are waging a strenuous fight |
to keep out professional competi
tors. The City Fathers are supposed j
to decide this week who gets to use ;
the Coliseum next fall.
But don't put all your chips on
the colleges winning out. The pros
are determined to crack the pre- i
viously exclusive hunting grounds
of the Trojans and the Bruins. If J
they aren't able to get the Coliseum. I
they might even erect bleachers on |
the beach of Santa Monica, and j
have their teams rollick around on
the sand. . . . Au revoir.
