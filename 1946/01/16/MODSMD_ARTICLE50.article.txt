# 1932 Squad Met Defeat
## 
### 
The record that I have to reveal
today is a painful one. But that will
not deter this department from its
sworn duty. We have promised to
give you Stanford's basketball his
tory and that's what we mean to do.
The fact that we'll run onto some
years such as '32 will not stop us.
You have got to learn to take "the
bitter with the better," so get hold
on something solid, here goes.
In 1932, it says here, the Indians
won two games and lost nine. Yes,
friends, it's hard to believp but we
must face the facts, unpleasant as
they may be.
Music Review
For the stronger characters among
you, we have listed the game-by
game results. The more sensitive
ones are invited to turn to the music
review at this point.
The team didn't do badly in the
practice schedule, managing to win
more contests than they lost. In fact
they won the last three games of the
practice tilts and the first two of
the regular season. They whipped
U.C.L.A. 35 to 22 and si to 26.
Gruesome
Now for the gruesome aspects.
The Cards were licked by Southern
California 35 to 28 and 28 to 24.
They then met the University of
California and were drubbed 25 to
19.
U.C.L.A. then played us in their
own home yard and scored 35 points
while we made 27 and the follow
ing night repeated the win, this
time 25 to 19.
Consistent
To be consistent our boys ended
the season by losing two more
games to the University of Califor
nia: 33 to 16 and 29 to 18.
Wei. there you have it. The red
skins found themselves in the cel
lar that year, having won only two
games. Tslc tsk!â€”Rotenberug
