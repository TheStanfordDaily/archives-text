HAMILTON. Bermuda, Jan. 15
(UP). — American commercial use
of war-built military airfields on
British lend-lease island bases in
the Western Atlantic was raised to
day as a major post-war problem
in the first session of the Anglo-
American civil aviation conference.
After this morning's meeting,
which lasted only 15 minutes,
American and British delegates ad
mittedly were "far apart" on the
lend-lease airports and other issues.
Freedom of the skies—the right
of commercial airlines to land in
other countries and pick up pas
sengers of any nationality—also is a
heated problem. The Americans
want a free-for-all scramble for
worldwide business, while the Brit
ish, with comparatively few planes
and far behind in commercial de
velopments, seek a prohibition or
limitation of "promiscuous landing."
Both Americans and British feel
strongly about the lend-lease bases.
The Americans assert their money
and labor built the fields and it
would be unfair if they were denied
use of them. The British reply that
the leases were for military pur
poses only, and that their use now
would give American lines a distinct
advantage.
