# Eucalypto Plans Gay Nineties Pete
## 
### 
Alleging that the Gay Nineties
were never as gay as they will be
Friday night, co-chairmen Candy
Keating and Fran Goodrich yester
day added Harrison and Encina Halls
to the list of invited guests for Casa
Eucalypto's party.
A bar serving appropriate refresh
ments will be tended by a bartender
and costumed bar-maids. A floor
show including a take-off of a Bea
trice Kaye song and dance, gay nine
ties songs and a skit burlesquing the
era will be given midway in the eve
ning.
Decollations chairmen Marion
Heinicke and Belh Van Hoesen are
planning signs, murals, and swinging
doors. Fillmore. Arthur, and Adams
Halls have accepted invitations to
the dance, to be held in the casa
social room.
Half the married people in the
United States are women.
