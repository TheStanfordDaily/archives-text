# Intramural Games Open
## 
### 
The new intramural basketball
program got off to a fast start here
tonight as the Legal Eagles defeated
Johnson Hall and Enclna 1 took a
pasting from Fillmore in the open
ers.
For the first few minutes of the
Johnson - Legal Eagles game, the
outcome seemed doubtful, but, with
the score tied at four all, the law
yers suddenly broke loose and fin
ished the first half with a comfor
table 15-8 lead. The Legal Eagles
had no trouble in the second half,
finishing the game with an easy 22-
10 victory. A tight Legal Eagle de
fense was too much for the John
sonites who scored only one goal
during the entire second half.
Johnson Lacks Co-ordination
The Johnson quintet had trouble
<vith their defensive, shifting from
a zone to a man-to-man with little
effect. Their main trouble seemed
to be a lack of team co-ordination,
probably owing to insufficient prac
tice. The faster, taller Legal Eagle
outfit was often able to get in be
hind the Johnson defense where
they scored on a surprisingly large
percentage of their shots.
Standout of the game was Ric
Supple of the Legal Eagles, who
led both teams with eight points.
For the Johnson team, Miller and
Whitley each sank two field goals.
Fillmore Downs Encina I
Over in the Pavilion, a superior
Fillmore squad had no trouble
swamping a team from Encina I by
the lopsided score of 35-14. Milton
and Sturgeon led the Fillmore
squad with eight and seven points,
respectively, and Dietrich paced the
losers with five.
In the second game at the Gym,
the Phi Psi's took a thriller from
Jefferson. 19-17, in the third of the
League I tilts. Luke Pitts of the
victors was high point man, with
nine.â€”Sabin
