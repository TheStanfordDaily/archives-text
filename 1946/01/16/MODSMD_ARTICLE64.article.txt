# Card Cagers Prepare For U.C.L.A. Series
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
The news keeps getting better and
better. It's gotten so good in fact,
that even Coach Everett Dean thinks
that the Farm cagers could whip
UCLA this weekend without such an
event being classified as an out and
out upset.
However, let's not ring the tocsin
yet. There are a few minor items
still kicking aroundâ€”like playing
the games. Just thought you'd like
to know that the Injuns are round
ing into shape, while the Bruin is
still navigating under a hex sign.
Good News
On the credit side, is the news
that Tom Rodman has turned out
for practice again, after a couple of
weeks on the sidelines due to an in
jured knee, courtesy of Utah. Ef
fectiveness of Rodman, one of the
better baekcourt men until the Utes
hacked him, is still an unknown
quantity, but his presence will bol
ster the guards.
More good news! Bill Christian -
son. he who played almost all of-two
games on one leg, is none the worse
for his ordeal and coming along
very nicely, thank you. Chris is
definitely the Farm's key man on
the court, for without him the Big
Red seems to lack in purpose and
destination.
Only gray spot bothering the
team are the frozen feet of Bill
O'Brien. The lanky center suffered
trenchfoot in Germany and the re
sultant' poor circulation quenches
his effectiveness after about 10 or 15
minutes on the court.
Star Player Leaves
From ASUCLA's Vic Kelley comes
an epistle in red ink, letting us
know that Ensign Bob Arnold has
been transferred to Norfolk. Va., anil
hence unavailable to Coach Wilbur
Johns. Arnold is a holdover from
last year's pennant-winners, All-
Coast man, and one of the best
guards in the business today, accord
ing to Coach Dean. Oh well, one
man's meat, etc.
UCLA is a good team, notwith
standing its 13 losses in 15 starts.
The Bruins seem to have a penchant
lor losing the close ones; e.g., its 37-
35 thriller to Cal, and its 45-40 heart
breaker to USC. If you see any

i cage-minded citizens running around
with wrinkled brows, they're prob
ably trying to figure out why so
good a team has had so much trou
ble catching on this season.
Shoo-in Game
All of which adds up to this: If
Stanford plays the kind of ball it
showed it was capable of in the sec
! ond half of Friday's game, then you
can peg the Farm for a shoo-in.
With Christianson and Rodman
back and increasing in ability and
effectiveness; with Murphy display
ing his offensive capabilities at cen
ter; with Martin learning more and
more about the baekcourt technique;
and with the timing and coordination
of the squad as a whole slowly but
surely becoming more efficient, it
seems that the big Red is bound to
; ring the bell sooner or later.
And ring and well they can.
UCLA's record is even worse than
that of Stanford's in a good many re
spects. For one thing, the Cards
: haven't played 15 games. For an
other, jinxed as the Bruin is, it
hasn't sustained the losses that the
j Ilndian has. And, of course, the
; Uclans haven't had to start from
scratch as was the case of Coaches
Dean and Fordy Anderson.
