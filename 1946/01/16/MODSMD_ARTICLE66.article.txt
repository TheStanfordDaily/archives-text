# Truman Hopes For Mediation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP).—
In a review of the tense labor situ
ation, president Truman today
voiced renewed hope for averting a
steel strike, again criticized Con
gress for not passing fact-finding
legislation, and said the government

i does not plan seizure of strike
| threatened meat plants.
He discussed the unsettled labor
front at his press conference as the
Congress of Industrial Organiza
tions prepared for intensive strike
action if the U.S. Steel Corporation
fails to satisfy the 19 J /2 cents an
hour wage increase demanded by
the United Steel Workers (CIO).
The meeting will be the second at
the White House since last Satur
day. This time both Mr. Truman
and Reconversion Director John W.
Snyder will sit in.
The President and government
officials generally are said to feel
that if this dispute can be settled
amicably, most of the other major
industrial disputes can be ironed
| out.
U.S. Steel is the bellwether of
j that far-flung industry. Other ma
j jor industries usually follow its
I lead. A final settlement with USW
is believed to hinge on the govern-
I merit's approval of an increase in
I steel priecs. It is understood that
an increase of $3 to $5 a ton will be
granted if the industry agrees to in
crease wages substantially.


CHATS — President Truman
speaking from White House as
he delivered his message to the
American people. He lambasted
Congress for the "needless delay"
on proposals to settle labor-man
agement disputes and asked pub
lic to aid his program.
