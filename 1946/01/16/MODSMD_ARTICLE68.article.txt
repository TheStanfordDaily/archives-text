CHICAGO, Wednesday, Jan. I<>
(UP). — More than 3()().()()() CIO
and AFL packinghouse workers
started a nationwide walkout
early today after conciliation ef
forts failed to find a compromise
that would avert the strike ex
pected to cut off meat supplies in
a week.
Although the strike, first na
tionwide walkout in the industry's
history, began officially at 12:01
a.m. local time, full impact would
not be felt until workers were to
begin appearing for day shifts.
Only maintenance men were in
the plants as the deadline passed.

George A. Eastwood, Armour
president, revealed that the con
ciliators had offered to seek an OPA
increase in the price of dressed meat
if the packing house had agreed to
the wage boost of 17'/•> cents an
hour demanded by the CIO. It was
the first time in three days that the
results of the discussions between
conciliators, union leaders and
packers had been officially made
public.
Eastwood revealed the concilia
tors had offered to seek a boost in
the ceiling price of 10 to 12[■> cents
per hundredweight for civilian pur
chases. The conciliators also had
suggested that the government
would pay 30 to 35 cents more per
hundredweight on its purchases of
dressed meat.
