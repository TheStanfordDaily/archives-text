# Sandburg's Poems Read Yesterday
## 
### 
Before reading of poetry of Carl
Sandburg, Riehard F. Jones, head of
the English department, read some
of Sandburg's definitions of poetry
that are shown in his writing at the
poetry reading given yesterday.
Sandburg has a "stop, look, and
listen style" aecording to Professor
Jones. Sandburg considers poetry a
"project across silence to break si
lence and echo." The mystery of the
universe appealed to Sandburg and
much of his work shows this mystery
aspect.
Subject Interest
Of the nationalistic school, Sand
burg writes particularly of his con
temporary scene, and was more in
terested in subject than in technique
and impression.
Professor Jones said he would omit
the sociological side of Sandburg be
cause he felt it showed a lack of
poetic feeling and diction.
Power of Imagery
The reading began with "Lost,"
which depicts Sandburg's great pow
er of imagery; "A Fence," which
shows ceaseless change with the
passage of time (this is the theme of
many of Sandburg's poems); "Un
der"; "At a Window"; "Under the
Harvest Moon"; "Monotone," a de
scription of the feeling of tenderness
toward things of nature.
"Nocturne in a Deserted Brick
yard"; "Dreams in the Dusk" which
shows the hopes of humanity; "From
the Shore," which has an undertone
of melody even though in free verse;
"The Mist," which figures much in
his poetry; "The Junk Man," on
death; "Death Snips Proud Men," on
the strength of death; "Sandpip
ers"; "Three Pictures"; "Autumn
Movement," on the theme of change;
"Impenetrable Misery;" "When
Abraham Is Called to the Cool
Tombs," "Grass," which shows
Sandburg's eternal hunger; and
"Wilderness," on the animal instincts
of man.
Human Element
The human element stands out
strikingly in the last four poems—
"A 1 1 Day Long"; "The Harbor";
"They Will Say"; and a poem in nar
rative rather than lyric form.
Death was a favorite theme of
Sandburg. He liked to take old
themes and give them new expres
sion.—Barlow.
