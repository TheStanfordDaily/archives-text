LONDON. Jan. 15 (UP). —Iranian
Chief Delegate Seyed Hassan Ta
quizadeh threatened today to appeal
to the United Nations World As
sembly for protection of his coun
try's rights unless the Iranian dis
pute with Russia was settled soon.
Taquizadeh did not mention Rus
sia specifically in a speech to the
Assembly in which he said that
"certain great difficulties" in Iran
were of a nature which threatened
world relations. He reserved the
right, he said, to bring the problem
before the Assembly formally.
Press.for Solution
Before the meeting, however, Ta
quizadeh told the United Press that
Iran would press for a solution of
the controversy with Russia before
the end of this Assembly session. A
solution, he said, should include
withdrawal of all foreign troops and
complete freedom of action for the
Iranian government. Russia has re
fused to move her troops before the
previously planned date of March 1.
The Iranian delegate's speech
raised before the UNO Assembly
the first urgent world political con
troversy of the present general de
bate.
"Induce" Quiet
Despite his threat to press the
matter formally, United States and
British delegates indicated that they
were confident they could induce
him not to do so on the grounds that
to force consideration of such a
problem now might plunge the As
sembly into a violent partisan de
bate at the outset.
