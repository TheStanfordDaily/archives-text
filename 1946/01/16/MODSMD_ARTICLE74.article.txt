# Stars of Hope Show Tell Smiles, Trials At Farm
## 
### MELLON SHELTON BETH MacVICAR 
Even Walter Pidgeon lias had Cel
lar trouble! In a short, after-the-
Bob-Hope-show interview back
stage last night, Pidgeon was be
moaning the fact that he and the cast
had had no dinner—and all because
he took too long learning his "oper
atic number" (Chiekery Chick) dur
ing rehearsals in Memorial Hall yes
terday afternoon.
It was rumored that the cast was
to eat at Toyon with the NROTC
unit there, but they had to give up
dinner plans "because I held up re
hearsals," Pidgeon said. "So I or
dered a large chocolate milkshake

from someplace here on campus," he
continued.
Missed Food
"The Cellar?" asked an eager au
tograph hunter. "Yes, that was it,"
Pidgeon declared. The milkshake
arrived intact," he added, "and he
actually saw it on his way to the
dressing room and intended to come
right back and drink it down.
"But someone else had the same
idea," he said, "and beat me to it.
By the time I got back, no shake.
No dinner."
Memorial Hall Filled
Pidgeon appeared on the Hope ra
dio program as guest star when it
was broadcast on a coast-to-coast
network from Memorial Hall last
night. Nearly 2,000 Stanford stu
dents filled the auditorium to over
flowing, "and," declared Pidgeon,
"it was one of the best audiences
I've ever seen."
The interview with the stars of
the program was gleaned between
requests for autographs and the
flashing of light bulbs, as photog
raphers caught the stars in formal
and informal poses foßowing the
show.
Stanford "Really Responded"
In spite of heavy police guard sur
rounding the auditorium, approxi
mately 100 persons managed to get
back stage after the show for the
usual autograph seeking. In between
flashing Pepsodent toothpaste smiles
for cameramen, and cracking jokes
for onlookers, Hope agreed with
Pidgeon that the student audience
was "among the best I've ever seen.
They really responded in a big way,"
he said. "We had a lot of fun doing
our show here."
Next Show in Palm Springs
Hope said he was planning to re
turn to Los Angeles last night, "if
the planes get off the ground." The
cast has been staying at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco, but Hope
came up from Los Angeles yesterday
afternoon in time }o do his show at
Dibble Hospital just before coming
to Ihe Farm.
Hope is now staying in Palm
Springs, and "we will do our show
there next week."
When the Daily reporters trekked
over to the Memorial Hall at 4 yes
terday afternoon in an ill-fated at r
tempt to arrange a before-the
show interview, the front entrance
was supporting about three hands of
bridge. Early-c?>mers forgot dinner
and waited at the door to assure
themselves of front row seats.
Bobby-Soxers Besiege Pidgeon
Back stage saw half a dozen Paly
High bobby soxers waiting for a
glimpse of Pidgeon. The cast was
about fifteen minutes late in arriv
ing and managed to sneak in a side
entrance without being discovered.
Later, however, someone left the
dressing room door open, revealing
Hope, Pidgeon. Jerry Colonna, Fran
ces Langford, various script writers
and other members of the cast going
over the script.

The bobby-soxers did a double
take and literally fell on Pidgeon as
he left the dressing room to rehearse
his "operatic number" with the or
chestra. He willingly signed auto
graph books while the girls alter
nately trembled and squealed.
As he handed one book back to its
owner, she sighed, "Hold me up. I'm
weak."
That Cellar Again
He asked them where he might
get some food, and they suggested
the Cellar. "Is it on campus?" he
asked. "Y-e-es!" they sighed in uni
son.
One of the girls then tapped him
on the arm. "Lot us take you there,
Mr. Pidgeon," she begged. "Well,
much as I'd like to see this lovely
campus with these beauties (squeal),
I have work to do." (Disappointed
sigh.) He grinned and walked to
the stage as the girls backed away
reverently.
"After all, we couldn't expect too
much of him," one of them re
marked as they left the building.
Old Farm Hand
Back stage after the show Mr.
Pidgeon brought exclamations from
admiring Stanford women when he
declared that he has visited Stanford
often. "I used to come up for all the
football games," he said.
Photographers—from Paramount,
the Quad, and the Daily—snapped
Hope with students and Palo Alto
residents who wanted him shown
reading a copy of "Peninsula Life."
In a shot that "resembled something
cooked up by Paramount," Hope
pecked around an ancient backstage
"tree" at Barbara Lee Cooper and a
willing student veteran.
About the Script
Colonna, of the fantastic mustache,
obliged Daily reporters asking for an
interview with an explosive, "I cer
tainly will." He explained the tech
nical preparation of the script, most
of which came from research in Hol
lywood and calls to campus offices.
At 5 p.m. script writers who had ar
rived in advance of the cast, were
still on the lookout for material, still
exchanging long distance phone calls
for script changes.
Skinnay Ennis' second visit to
Stanford in as many months called
forth smiles of appreciation from
him. "Wish we could get over to the
Cellar," he said, "but the show is
leaving the city right away. We're
all pretty tired after two shows."
All in all, Paly High outstripped
Ihe Stanford students in aggressive
ness; reports backstage told of four
girls whose ladder to the second
floor of the Hall landed them in a
faculty member's office. "We couldn't
get tickets." they were said to have
explained, "but we sure wanted to
see the show."

was broadcast on a coast-to-coast
network from Memorial Hall last
night. Nearly 2,000 Stanford stu
dents filled the auditorium to over
flowing, "and," declared Pidgeon,
"it was one of the best audiences
I've ever seen."
The interview with the stars of
the program was gleaned between
requests for autographs and the
flashing of light bulbs, as photog
raphers caught the stars in formal
and informal poses foßowing the
show.
Stanford "Really Responded"
In spite of heavy police guard sur
rounding the auditorium, approxi
mately 100 persons managed to get
back stage after the show for the
usual autograph seeking. In between
flashing Pepsodent toothpaste smiles
for cameramen, and cracking jokes
for onlookers, Hope agreed with
Pidgeon that the student audience
was "among the best I've ever seen.
They really responded in a big way,"
he said. "We had a lot of fun doing
our show here."
Next Show in Palm Springs
Hope said he was planning to re
turn to Los Angeles last night, "if
the planes get off the ground." The
cast has been staying at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco, but Hope
came up from Los Angeles yesterday
afternoon in time }o do his show at
Dibble Hospital just before coming
to Ihe Farm.
Hope is now staying in Palm
Springs, and "we will do our show
there next week."
When the Daily reporters trekked
over to the Memorial Hall at 4 yes
terday afternoon in an ill-fated at r
tempt to arrange a before-the
show interview, the front entrance
was supporting about three hands of
bridge. Early-c?>mers forgot dinner
and waited at the door to assure
themselves of front row seats.
Bobby-Soxers Besiege Pidgeon
Back stage saw half a dozen Paly
High bobby soxers waiting for a
glimpse of Pidgeon. The cast was
about fifteen minutes late in arriv
ing and managed to sneak in a side
entrance without being discovered.
Later, however, someone left the
dressing room door open, revealing
Hope, Pidgeon. Jerry Colonna, Fran
ces Langford, various script writers
and other members of the cast going
over the script.

The bobby-soxers did a double
take and literally fell on Pidgeon as
he left the dressing room to rehearse
his "operatic number" with the or
chestra. He willingly signed auto
graph books while the girls alter
nately trembled and squealed.
As he handed one book back to its
owner, she sighed, "Hold me up. I'm
weak."
That Cellar Again
He asked them where he might
get some food, and they suggested
the Cellar. "Is it on campus?" he
asked. "Y-e-es!" they sighed in uni
son.
One of the girls then tapped him
on the arm. "Lot us take you there,
Mr. Pidgeon," she begged. "Well,
much as I'd like to see this lovely
campus with these beauties (squeal),
I have work to do." (Disappointed
sigh.) He grinned and walked to
the stage as the girls backed away
reverently.
"After all, we couldn't expect too
much of him," one of them re
marked as they left the building.
Old Farm Hand
Back stage after the show Mr.
Pidgeon brought exclamations from
admiring Stanford women when he
declared that he has visited Stanford
often. "I used to come up for all the
football games," he said.
Photographers—from Paramount,
the Quad, and the Daily—snapped
Hope with students and Palo Alto
residents who wanted him shown
reading a copy of "Peninsula Life."
In a shot that "resembled something
cooked up by Paramount," Hope
pecked around an ancient backstage
"tree" at Barbara Lee Cooper and a
willing student veteran.
About the Script
Colonna, of the fantastic mustache,
obliged Daily reporters asking for an
interview with an explosive, "I cer
tainly will." He explained the tech
nical preparation of the script, most
of which came from research in Hol
lywood and calls to campus offices.
At 5 p.m. script writers who had ar
rived in advance of the cast, were
still on the lookout for material, still
exchanging long distance phone calls
for script changes.
Skinnay Ennis' second visit to
Stanford in as many months called
forth smiles of appreciation from
him. "Wish we could get over to the
Cellar," he said, "but the show is
leaving the city right away. We're
all pretty tired after two shows."
All in all, Paly High outstripped
Ihe Stanford students in aggressive
ness; reports backstage told of four
girls whose ladder to the second
floor of the Hall landed them in a
faculty member's office. "We couldn't
get tickets." they were said to have
explained, "but we sure wanted to
see the show."
Even Walter Pidgeon lias had Cel
lar trouble! In a short, after-the-
Bob-Hope-show interview back
stage last night, Pidgeon was be
moaning the fact that he and the cast
had had no dinner—and all because
he took too long learning his "oper
atic number" (Chiekery Chick) dur
ing rehearsals in Memorial Hall yes
terday afternoon.
It was rumored that the cast was
to eat at Toyon with the NROTC
unit there, but they had to give up
dinner plans "because I held up re
hearsals," Pidgeon said. "So I or
dered a large chocolate milkshake

from someplace here on campus," he
continued.
Missed Food
"The Cellar?" asked an eager au
tograph hunter. "Yes, that was it,"
Pidgeon declared. The milkshake
arrived intact," he added, "and he
actually saw it on his way to the
dressing room and intended to come
right back and drink it down.
"But someone else had the same
idea," he said, "and beat me to it.
By the time I got back, no shake.
No dinner."

Dibble Hospital just before coming
to Ihe Farm.
Hope is now staying in Palm
Springs, and "we will do our show
there next week."
When the Daily reporters trekked
over to the Memorial Hall at 4 yes
terday afternoon in an ill-fated at r
tempt to arrange a before-the
show interview, the front entrance
was supporting about three hands of
bridge. Early-c?>mers forgot dinner
and waited at the door to assure
themselves of front row seats.
Bobby-Soxers Besiege Pidgeon
Back stage saw half a dozen Paly
High bobby soxers waiting for a
glimpse of Pidgeon. The cast was
about fifteen minutes late in arriv
ing and managed to sneak in a side
entrance without being discovered.
Later, however, someone left the
dressing room door open, revealing
Hope, Pidgeon. Jerry Colonna, Fran
ces Langford, various script writers
and other members of the cast going
over the script.

The bobby-soxers did a double
take and literally fell on Pidgeon as
he left the dressing room to rehearse
his "operatic number" with the or
chestra. He willingly signed auto
graph books while the girls alter
nately trembled and squealed.
As he handed one book back to its
owner, she sighed, "Hold me up. I'm
weak."
That Cellar Again
He asked them where he might
get some food, and they suggested
the Cellar. "Is it on campus?" he
asked. "Y-e-es!" they sighed in uni
son.
One of the girls then tapped him
on the arm. "Lot us take you there,
Mr. Pidgeon," she begged. "Well,
much as I'd like to see this lovely
campus with these beauties (squeal),
I have work to do." (Disappointed
sigh.) He grinned and walked to
the stage as the girls backed away
reverently.
"After all, we couldn't expect too
much of him," one of them re
marked as they left the building.
Old Farm Hand
Back stage after the show Mr.
Pidgeon brought exclamations from
admiring Stanford women when he
declared that he has visited Stanford
often. "I used to come up for all the
football games," he said.
Photographers—from Paramount,
the Quad, and the Daily—snapped
Hope with students and Palo Alto
residents who wanted him shown
reading a copy of "Peninsula Life."
In a shot that "resembled something
cooked up by Paramount," Hope
pecked around an ancient backstage
"tree" at Barbara Lee Cooper and a
willing student veteran.
About the Script
Colonna, of the fantastic mustache,
obliged Daily reporters asking for an
interview with an explosive, "I cer
tainly will." He explained the tech
nical preparation of the script, most
of which came from research in Hol
lywood and calls to campus offices.
At 5 p.m. script writers who had ar
rived in advance of the cast, were
still on the lookout for material, still
exchanging long distance phone calls
for script changes.
Skinnay Ennis' second visit to
Stanford in as many months called
forth smiles of appreciation from
him. "Wish we could get over to the
Cellar," he said, "but the show is
leaving the city right away. We're
all pretty tired after two shows."
All in all, Paly High outstripped
Ihe Stanford students in aggressive
ness; reports backstage told of four
girls whose ladder to the second
floor of the Hall landed them in a
faculty member's office. "We couldn't
get tickets." they were said to have
explained, "but we sure wanted to
see the show."
Even Walter Pidgeon lias had Cel
lar trouble! In a short, after-the-
Bob-Hope-show interview back
stage last night, Pidgeon was be
moaning the fact that he and the cast
had had no dinner—and all because
he took too long learning his "oper
atic number" (Chiekery Chick) dur
ing rehearsals in Memorial Hall yes
terday afternoon.
It was rumored that the cast was
to eat at Toyon with the NROTC
unit there, but they had to give up
dinner plans "because I held up re
hearsals," Pidgeon said. "So I or
dered a large chocolate milkshake

from someplace here on campus," he
continued.
Missed Food
"The Cellar?" asked an eager au
tograph hunter. "Yes, that was it,"
Pidgeon declared. The milkshake
arrived intact," he added, "and he
actually saw it on his way to the
dressing room and intended to come
right back and drink it down.
"But someone else had the same
idea," he said, "and beat me to it.
By the time I got back, no shake.
No dinner."
Memorial Hall Filled
Pidgeon appeared on the Hope ra
dio program as guest star when it
was broadcast on a coast-to-coast
network from Memorial Hall last
night. Nearly 2,000 Stanford stu
dents filled the auditorium to over
flowing, "and," declared Pidgeon,
"it was one of the best audiences
I've ever seen."
The interview with the stars of
the program was gleaned between
requests for autographs and the
flashing of light bulbs, as photog
raphers caught the stars in formal
and informal poses foßowing the
show.
Stanford "Really Responded"
In spite of heavy police guard sur
rounding the auditorium, approxi
mately 100 persons managed to get
back stage after the show for the
usual autograph seeking. In between
flashing Pepsodent toothpaste smiles
for cameramen, and cracking jokes
for onlookers, Hope agreed with
Pidgeon that the student audience
was "among the best I've ever seen.
They really responded in a big way,"
he said. "We had a lot of fun doing
our show here."
Next Show in Palm Springs
Hope said he was planning to re
turn to Los Angeles last night, "if
the planes get off the ground." The
cast has been staying at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco, but Hope
came up from Los Angeles yesterday
afternoon in time }o do his show at
Dibble Hospital just before coming
to Ihe Farm.
Hope is now staying in Palm
