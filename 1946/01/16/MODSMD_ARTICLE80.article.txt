# Traveller Tells European Need
## 
### 
Rev. Sidney Lovett, chaplain of
Yale, interviewed students particu
larly interested in the World Stu
dent Service Fund, of which he is
chairman, yesterday afternoon dur
ing a short visit to Stanford.
After traveling through the liber
i ated countries in Europe, Dr. Lov
| ett will tour "American universities
and student centers where money
contributed by students is being
translated into terms of food, shel
ter and hospitalization of distressed
European students."
Million-Dollar Goal
The Fund has been aiding stu
dents in Europe and China for the
last five years, although it originally
began as a small contribution to
China. Between 700 and 800 schools
are now on the list of contributors.
The nation-wide goal for this year
has been set at $1,000,000 or ap
proximately SI per student.
Dr. Lovett told Stanford students
where the money goes in Europe
und China. In his travels through
England, Switzerland, France, Hol
land, and Belgium he noticed that
the situation was very restricted in
regard to food. The housing prob
lem is also quite acute due to .the
extensive bombings throughout the
liberated countries.
Transportation Bad
Economically all the countries are
badly dislocated, commented Dr.
Lovett, and transportation difficul
ties tend to emphasize this even
more. The food shortage is a direct
| result of this lack of distribution
! facilities.
However, the overall picture is
much improved over conditions of
last year. Nothing like the disaster
of last year in Holland, when 60,000

people died of starvatio n > will re
occur.
Little Heal This Winter
Fuel is also lacking, and r - Lov
ett predicted there would little
heat in European homes thi. s win
ter. In France the ration
something like 300 pounds o' coa '
for a family to use during the entire
ueason.
Dr. Lovett thanked Stanford f° r
including the Fund in its amt ua '
?hest and reported that the moi ie y
has been a great benefit to EurP"
pean students. He returned late iP
the afternoon to Berkeley which hi?
has used as the focal point for his
visits throughout the San Francisco
area. Later on in the week he will
go to Los Angeles to complete an
other series of visits.

Dr. Lovett thanked Stanford f° r

Rev. Sidney Lovett, chaplain of
Yale, interviewed students particu
larly interested in the World Stu
dent Service Fund, of which he is
chairman, yesterday afternoon dur
ing a short visit to Stanford.
After traveling through the liber
i ated countries in Europe, Dr. Lov
| ett will tour "American universities
and student centers where money
contributed by students is being
translated into terms of food, shel
ter and hospitalization of distressed
European students."
Million-Dollar Goal
The Fund has been aiding stu
dents in Europe and China for the
last five years, although it originally
began as a small contribution to
China. Between 700 and 800 schools
are now on the list of contributors.
The nation-wide goal for this year
has been set at $1,000,000 or ap
proximately SI per student.
Dr. Lovett told Stanford students
where the money goes in Europe
und China. In his travels through
England, Switzerland, France, Hol
land, and Belgium he noticed that
the situation was very restricted in
regard to food. The housing prob
lem is also quite acute due to .the
extensive bombings throughout the
liberated countries.
Transportation Bad
Economically all the countries are
badly dislocated, commented Dr.
Lovett, and transportation difficul
ties tend to emphasize this even
more. The food shortage is a direct
| result of this lack of distribution
! facilities.
However, the overall picture is
much improved over conditions of
last year. Nothing like the disaster
of last year in Holland, when 60,000

people died of starvatio n > will re
occur.
