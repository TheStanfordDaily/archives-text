## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. Mi (UP). —President Truman will offer his own
formula for settlement of the steel wage dispute if the management-labor
deadlock is not broken tomorrow, the White House announced tonight.
Benjamin F. Fairloss, president of the U.S. Steel Corporation, and
Philin Murray. CIO president and head of the United Steel Workers' Un-

ion, held two White House sessions <
during the day under pressure from j
Mr. Truman, who asked them to
reach an agreement in the interests |
of the nation. A general steel strike !
is scheduled for 12:01 a.m. Monday. I
Mr. Truman personally ap
pealed to their* a( the start of the
afternoon session to reach an
agreement in the interests of the j
nation's welfare. But that session,
lasting more than four hours, j
failed to achieve results.
Government labor officials believe t
a settlement of the steel dispute will j
pave the way for breaking the log- j
jam of other serious labor troubles, j
The union originally demanded a j
25 cents an hour increase. It has j
lowered this to 19' ■> cents — the j
amount recommended by the Presi- {
dent's fact-finding board in the |
General Motors dispute. The un
ion's demand was described as its I
last word, and it was prepared to
enforce that demand with a nation
wide strike beginning at 12:01 a.m.
Monday.
The U.S. Steel Corporation has j
offered a 15-cent increase. There i
were indications that il would
counter the union's revised de- j
mand with a proposal somewhere j
between the 15 cents and
cents.
DETROIT, Jan. it; (UP). The'
CIO Auto Workers' Union offered
tonight to accept a presidential pan
el wage formula as the basis for a
general compromise of its 30 per j
ccnt pay hike demands on the auto- |
motive industry.
The backdown from a rigid in
sistence on a 30 per cent minimum
developed swiftly from a specific
compromise ofier to strike-bound
General Motors and a similar offer
to Ford Motor Company.
