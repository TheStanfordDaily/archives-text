# Nanking Dean Of Women Speaks Here
## 
### 
Dr. Mei-Yun Li, who is to re
turn to her native China as Dean
of Women of the University of Nan
king, suggested an interchange of
ideas and friendship between the
Y.W.C.A. of China and the Stanford
Y.W.C.A. at the "Y" cabinet meet
ing yesterday afternoon.
"The 'Y' of China has more op
portunities for work than the Y.W.-
C.A. of America," said the vivacious
Chinese educator. "We consider
Y.W.C.A. work second only to the
work of schools."
Dr. Li added that at Girding Col
lege, where she was formerly Dean
of Women, the chairman of the
Y.W.C.A. committee was seeond
only to the president, of the student
body in importance. She explained
the "Y" held its prominent posi
tion through the work it did in oc
cupational training, adult education,
and general relief work.
"The Y.W.C.A. establishes camps
throughout China, not for the pur
pose of leisure, but to train people
to read and write and earn their
living." said Dr. Li. "The General
Secretary of the 'Y' in China exerts
a vital influence."
