# Committee To Consider Strike Bills
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1(> (UP).—
Amid new Republican charges that
the Administration is stalling on re
conversion strikes, the House Mili
tary Affairs Committee today de
cided to tackle the problem itself
within a few days.
Chairman Andrew J. May, D.,
K.v., said members agreed at a
closed session to delay action on
proposed strike remedies to give the
Labor Committee "a reasonable
time—a few days" to come up with
a solution of its own.
One step contemplated is to
press for House approval of the
May committee's hill to impose
heavy penalties on unions which
violate contracts by striking. It
was reported to the floor last year
hut House members refused to
consider it.
Republican whip Leslie Arends,
HI., co-author of the bill, has threat
ened even more drastic legislation
to halt industrial strife.
May said his committee deferred
immediate action to give the labor
group time to "do something about
the serious situation." President
Truman's fact-finding proposal to
open corporation books to govern
ment wage fixers and to enforce a
30-day pre-strike cooling-off period
is pending before the Labor Com
mittee.
"Wr don't want to be put in the
position of coercing or attempting
to coerce another committee into
action," May explained.
House Republicans leveled a new
barrage of oratory against the Ad
ministration's labor policies, with
Rep. Chester Gross, Pa., protesting
that the Administration itself "is on
strike."
Apparently referring to Mr. Trif
man's decision to postpone his state
of-the-union message until Mon
day, Gross complained that "the
Administration doesn't bring any
legislation in here. They don't give
us anything to do."
Rep. Clarence Brown, R., 0.,
charged that the blame for delay
in reconversion legislation "rests
squarely on the While House."
Rep. Adolph J. Sabath, D., 111.,
dean of the House, came to Mr.
Truman's defense. He said the
President was "doing a splendid job
in trying to bring peace and har
mony to America"and doubtless
delayed his message until lie was
"able to say that he has adjusted all
pending strikes."
Hie President told a news confer
ence Tuesday that he is still bank
ing on his fact-finding proposal to
resolve disputes; that the General
Motors dispute would have been
settled by now if Congress had
adopted it before the 2.'5-day Christ
ina* recess as he recommended.
