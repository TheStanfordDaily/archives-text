# Demobilization Data
## 
### 
Combatting the evasiveness of Congress, the
ma;,n demonstrations of Gl's still,overseas, and
the loud voiced sympathy of the home front,
w) : h in compound are laying the way to na
tion . ide hysteria, Army officials last week re
tract i their ill-advised promise that all two
yea. man will be home by March, and have or
ders : 1 over-all slowdown in demobilization.
Th; s decision, though affording no solution to
the basic threat, was motivated by statistical
knowledge that if continued, their rapid, un
compensated discharge of trained men would
eventually not only destroy the effective fight
ing force it took five years to build, but would
alio leave the United States far short of the
men needed for its minimum commitments in
overseas occupation.
That the Army's belated decision caused an
almost hopeless bottleneck at processing sta
tion.; and an enforced idleness among units ov
ersea;. is undeniably due to the Army's short
sighted, fluctuating policy. Demonstrations now
are directed at alleviating conditions already ar
rived at, and the harried War Department is
having difficulty in arguing for its new-found
policy which emerged from an observance of
the following statistics:
The Army is now committed to a force of
1,500,030 men—for occupation in Europe, the
Pacific, and other areas overseas; for manning
inst Rations at home and a part of the whole to
be in training or in transit. However if the
present discharge rate (1,000,000 in December)
were maintained, the force at hand by July of
this year would already fall far short of that
number.
Since V-J day the Army has unconscionably
directed its efforts to getting our men home and
out of uniform; today, it realizes that the na
tional security and enforcement of the peace
are issues far outweighing in importance the
immediate demand of these men to come home
now that the war proper is over.
The block to discharge of men long in serv
ice will bo removed as soon as the Army is
insured a compensating fund of manpower—
through renewal of the Selective Service Act,
and an increased monthly of enlistment.
Up till now the expected supplementary force
of trainees and men who re-enlisted has not and
apparently will not take care of the differen
tial unless the Army policy toward men in
service is rapidly and extensively revised.
Only 400,000 have enlisted or re-enlisted, many
of these for short terms. Selective Service quo
tas which were slashed from 800,000 to 500,000
immediately following V-J Day fell short 60,000
in the first four months.
Perhaps draft boards have been too lenient.
Probably the Army has not outlined a suffi
ciently alluring or effective program to attract
re-enlistments, or to keep satisfied the men who
now are marking time at overseas bases, hoping
the Army will make up its mind.
Presumably the 1 500,000 men are needed for
jobs vital to the national and international se
curity. If this is so, no soldier who has fought
in a four-year war will object to doing his part
if his particular part is an irreplaceable one.
To convince those men who now seem to be
getting the raw end of an official deal, however,
the Army must see to it that their efforts are
directed along lines of maximum efficiency and
effectiveness, and to keep them operating thus,
give attention to GI gripes, and an open book
on the wherefores of individual discharges.
All the Army's efforts to maintain her forces
intact, however, can be destroyed by the dick
erings of a Congress which so far has avoided
c decision on conscription and has been split
on the issue of demobilization. The Selective
Service Act expires May 15; unless it is re
newed by congressmen who are timidly aware
that this is an election year, the Army's plight
will be worse than at present.
Underlying military and congressional trou
ble 3 is a public opinion which is apparently
too quick to forget the pledges of wartime. The
demobilization slow-down is disheartening in
its immediate aspects to be sure, but must be
fearlessly upheld in the interests of peace.
