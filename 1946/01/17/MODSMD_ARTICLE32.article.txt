"Stanford is certainly fouled up!" . . . ''Is this what
we were so anxious to come back to?" . . .
These statements, and other similar ones, have come

to my attention much too often during the past two
weeks to let them go unmentioned.
Il is agreed by most all concerned that tilings here
at Stanford aren't just what they were a few years
ago, and that something must be done in the way of
improvement. But who is responsible? What can
be done?
Let us examine some of the accusations made by re
turning students, as well as those of the student body
who were here during the war years.
In the first place some citizens of Stanford do not
like the idea of admitting so many students when there
is no provision made for them after they arrive. This
includes living facilities and classroom space. They also
do not like so many off-campus students. The true
spirit of Stanford is lost when everyone does not live
together in one area.
Many of the courses offered to returning students
do not seem to fill the bill. They are either too ju
venile; or they include seemingly useless require
ments which prolong graduation and getting a job.
Too much "control from the top" has been a criti
cism. The role of the hasher is not what it used to be.
He is too much of a servant rather than a member of
the group as has been the tradition. Certain social
dogmas bring raised eyebrows and rebelling attitudes.
This is not intended to be a gripe column. I am not
criticizing any one individual or any one organization
for the change that has occurred here. It is my opinion
that this thing can and must be cleared up for the fu
ture of Stanford. Farm men in the service during the
past few years actually lived until the day they could
return to their alma mater. Now that they are here
some are disappointed in what they find. They declare
with emphasis that it certainly isn't what they left.
Most of us accept with understanding the changes
that occurred during the war years. They were nec
essary. They performed their task, and Stanford
made it through the war with the minimum of grief.
That is commendable.
But what is the trouble now? Everyone gripes but
no one seems to be able to put his finger on the actual
problem, much less the solution.
We may lay the blame on some offices of adminis
tration. We may lay the blame on a weak-kneed Ex
ecutive Committee. We may lay the blame on an infe
rior brand of Stanford students who possess no spirit
or foresight. This is no accusation against any of the
above. It is only a mention of the possibilities of where
the trouble originated. Perhaps it is a combination
of all
Rut the fact remains that things here, as in a num
ber of other universities, seem to be "fouled up." II
is our responsibility to untangle the situation here.
If this is not accomplished, it may result in a serious
downhill trend for the University which will be hard
to check.
The Administration cannot clear up all the prob
lems; nor can the student Executive Committee. It is
a physical impossibility. The students must not only
talk among themselves, but must voice their sentiments
in the circles where action will be taken. Talking with
out resulting action has never accomplished a lot. And
it won't here.
In my first Bull Session of the quarter I mentioned
something which I will repeat here. It is time the
students took the reins once more, organized together
in a united effort to better the conditions about Stan-
Hud, and express their opinions openly and positively
to the individuals who are capable of carrying out
the wishes of the greatest number.
Only then will Stanford retain its greatness, and only
then will the spirit of Stanford progress and bring sat
isfaction to us.

a physical impossibility. The students must not only
talk among themselves, but must voice their sentiments
in the circles where action will be taken. Talking with
out resulting action has never accomplished a lot. And
it won't here.
In my first Bull Session of the quarter I mentioned
something which I will repeat here. It is time the
students took the reins once more, organized together
in a united effort to better the conditions about Stan-
Hud, and express their opinions openly and positively
to the individuals who are capable of carrying out
the wishes of the greatest number.
Only then will Stanford retain its greatness, and only
then will the spirit of Stanford progress and bring sat
isfaction to us.
"Stanford is certainly fouled up!" . . . ''Is this what
we were so anxious to come back to?" . . .
These statements, and other similar ones, have come

to my attention much too often during the past two
weeks to let them go unmentioned.
Il is agreed by most all concerned that tilings here
at Stanford aren't just what they were a few years
ago, and that something must be done in the way of
improvement. But who is responsible? What can
be done?
Let us examine some of the accusations made by re
turning students, as well as those of the student body
who were here during the war years.
In the first place some citizens of Stanford do not
like the idea of admitting so many students when there
is no provision made for them after they arrive. This
includes living facilities and classroom space. They also
do not like so many off-campus students. The true
spirit of Stanford is lost when everyone does not live
together in one area.
Many of the courses offered to returning students
do not seem to fill the bill. They are either too ju
venile; or they include seemingly useless require
ments which prolong graduation and getting a job.
Too much "control from the top" has been a criti
cism. The role of the hasher is not what it used to be.
He is too much of a servant rather than a member of
the group as has been the tradition. Certain social
dogmas bring raised eyebrows and rebelling attitudes.
This is not intended to be a gripe column. I am not
criticizing any one individual or any one organization
for the change that has occurred here. It is my opinion
that this thing can and must be cleared up for the fu
ture of Stanford. Farm men in the service during the
past few years actually lived until the day they could
return to their alma mater. Now that they are here
some are disappointed in what they find. They declare
with emphasis that it certainly isn't what they left.
Most of us accept with understanding the changes
that occurred during the war years. They were nec
essary. They performed their task, and Stanford
made it through the war with the minimum of grief.
That is commendable.
But what is the trouble now? Everyone gripes but
no one seems to be able to put his finger on the actual
problem, much less the solution.
We may lay the blame on some offices of adminis
tration. We may lay the blame on a weak-kneed Ex
ecutive Committee. We may lay the blame on an infe
rior brand of Stanford students who possess no spirit
or foresight. This is no accusation against any of the
above. It is only a mention of the possibilities of where
the trouble originated. Perhaps it is a combination
of all
Rut the fact remains that things here, as in a num
ber of other universities, seem to be "fouled up." II
is our responsibility to untangle the situation here.
If this is not accomplished, it may result in a serious
downhill trend for the University which will be hard
to check.
The Administration cannot clear up all the prob
lems; nor can the student Executive Committee. It is
a physical impossibility. The students must not only
talk among themselves, but must voice their sentiments
in the circles where action will be taken. Talking with
out resulting action has never accomplished a lot. And
