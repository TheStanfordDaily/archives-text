### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
When the present questions of labor and demobiliza
tion are cleared up, Congress will have to think in
terms of a national defense policy. One of the impor
tant elements in it would have to be air.
Airpower is a force for peace. In the nineteenth cen
tury, the Navy was predominant, and England held the
largest naval establishment in the world. She had the
advantage in personnel, production facilities, and tradi
tion. She also had a peaceful policy.
Naval Peace
The combination kept Europe at peace for a century.
True, some wars were fought, but they were always
very limited in scope. The aggressor with unlimited
appetite knew th; 4 if he satisfied his urge for power,
he would have to face the Royal Navy, which he could
not do and survive.
In the twentieth century, naval predominance has
given way to aerial predominance. We are the na
tion that has it now, and we can keep it. The last
war has given us the full-blown tradition built upon
the men who flew the rickety spads in 191 Sand
in light metals, and. with our acquisition of Green
in light metals, and, with our acquisition of Green
land, we hold the world's major source of cryolite,
indispensable in extracting aluminum.
If we were to utilize these things to have a peace
time airforce twice as large as any other nation, and we
were willing to use it when the next aggressor stuck
his head up, we might make the remaining years of the
twentieth century peaceful ones.
Air Pressure
Diplomatic pressure involving an airforce has been
used before. In the 1920'5, France dominated the skies.
When she marched into the Ruhr, Britain, who had dis
banded her squadrons or dispersed them throughout
her empire, protested. France concentrated her air
arm on the channel coast, and left the English note
unanswered.
Germany had the material superiority in the air in
the 1930'5. The Maginot Line-minded diplomats and
soldiers were confident that her Wehrmacht could be
held, but they were frightened into appeasement after
appeasement by her air force.
Munich
Befyre England went to Munich, Liddell-Hart sent
Chamberlain a memo on British military unprepared
ness, in which the main point stressed was the Reich's
air superiority and England's inadequate air defense.
A large American land army might be discarded
in future diplomatic calculations. An aggressor could
reason that, with war becoming faster all the time,
he could deal with his European foes before our in
fantry had time to intervene. But our air force
would be in the fight on the first day of hostilities,
and it could determine it, one way or the other, then.
Congress does not seem inclined to give the military
a free hand. That might be wise, considering the over
whelming national debt. But we are the only nation
that can really insure the peace, and we must be strong
to do it. The minimum amount of power we should
have is overwhelming air superiority. It has worked
for aggression before, but we must realize that it can
work for peace in the future.
