## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 16 (UP). —Iranian
delegates to the United Nations
World Assembly received instruc
tions from their government today
to put Iran's dispute with Russia
before the UNO. The delegates met
at once to consider whether to raise
the delicate problem, first major
diplomatic issue to confront the in
fant UNO, before the Assembly it
self or before the Security Council.
Seyed Hassan Taquizadeh, chief
Iranian delegate, said in an As
sembly speech yesterday that he
reserved the right to raise the is
sue unless the big powers suc
ceeded in solving it. Now, how
ever, his orders were to force con
sideration by the UNO.
The dispute concerns largely the
revolt in Iranian Azerbaijan, occu
pied by Soviet troops, which Iran
! alleges was instigated by Russia.
Taquizadeh told the United Press
| that his orders permitted him to
, choose whether to raise the issue
in the World Assembly or in the
Security Council of 11 nations in
; eluding the Big Five. Either body
j could refuse to consider the dispute
; but there is nothing to prevent Iran
1 raising it, unless the Big Three used
i their persuasive powers success
i fully.
(The situation may. however,
change because of a cabinet crisis
in Tehran. A United Press Teh
ran dispatch said that the Iranian
parliament sent a written request
Wednesday to Premier Ibrahim
Ilakimi to resign and that Hakimi
was expected to comply. Ilakimi
has been under attack.)
London newspapers reported that
! the Council decided today to invite
Iranian delegates to attend a meet
i ing tomorrow and present their
! complaint. Actually members met
I informally to discuss tomorrow's
meeting at which the Council will
!be formally organized. Those pres
' ent said Iran was not discussed.
