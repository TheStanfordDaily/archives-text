An interesting topic for loose verbiage is the reason—or rea
sons—UCLA never produces topflight athletic teams. Every year
their publicity department raises a lot of "hoopla" on the wonder
ful teams that the Westwood collegiate will field, but by the end
of the season, if athletic troupes have only more than mediocre
success, the whole school madly celebrates at the UCLA coun
terpart of Hank's, or Rossotti's.
To be specific, their football aggregations have never been
anything particular to brag about. UCLA, which started out in the
academic business in the late '20's, was excused for mediocrity
the first few years because of their newness in the athletic game,
but nobody anymore looks with sorrow at the Bruins for turning
out dismal teams. The school's closest approach to gridiron fame
was in the last decade when Kenny Washington and Jackie Rob
inson romped around to their heart's content. Even then they
didn't cop the Pacific Coast Conference, for—as usual—USC was
a little stronger. (Stanford in those years wasn't at their peak.)
EVEN THE NAVY DOESN'T HELP
During the war everybody expected the West Los Angeles
university to flourish with the naval unit encamped on the
grounds, but subsequent record books prove otherwise. This sea
son with a brand new coach and a star player, Cal Rossi, loyal
Bruin fans had visions of making the journey out to Arroyo Seco
on January 1, to see their favorite boys toss the pigskin around,
but 'lo and behold, guess who did play ambassador for the West
in the Rose Bowl.
The same goes for their basketball team. UCLA have been
tossed around like a bunch of hapless misfits by all other teams.
Last year UCLA grabbed the southern division basketball crown,
but no right-minded sports fan would call last year a normal sea
son, with General Lewis B. Hershey pointing that accusing finger
at every available chunk of manpower.
REDS SHOULD TAKE UCLANS
, This season Wilbur John's casaba charges have dropped 13
out of 15 contests. No team can be much good with that many
losses, which brings up the point of why so many San Francisco
sports scribes point out that UCLA will win hands down. We dis
agree. Casting aside Farm partisanship —and looking at the sit
uation scientifically and coolly—all points to a Stanford victory.
The Los Angeles extension of U. of C. has lost its stellar player,
Don Arnold, to the Navy, and should be completely disorganized
for their two-night stand at the Pavilion.
ANOTHER LEVINSON BUTCH
Correction department. Another error slipped by on us. Yes
terday's Slants carried the information, or more correctly, misin
formation, that "Bones" Hamilton was signed up to mentor the San
Francisco entry in the new All-American football league. The
name should have read Jim Lav/son. Apologies to everybody. No
excuse offered. Hope to improve in the future.
It seems to this writer that if some of those fellows who did all
that elbowing and shoving in the Bob Hope line the other night
would save their physical exuberance for football practice, every
body would be much more happy. Next quarter Marchie Schwartz
will put on a full dress rehearsal in anticipation of next fall's foot
ball season. In case anyone didn't know, or has forgotten, the
Stanford Indians resume full competition next fall. Our first game
will be against the Idaho Vandals. . . . Buenos dias.
