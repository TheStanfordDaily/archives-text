# Hitler's Citizenship, Austrian Occupation Reviewed at Trials
## 
### 
NUERNBERG, Jan. 16 (UP).—A
former German lawyer and concen
tration camp victim, appearing for
the prosecution at the war crimes
trial, today charged Nazi Interior
Minister Wilhelm Frick with being
the man who gave Adolf Hitler fake
German citizenship and thus paved
his road to power.

Dr. Robert M. W. Kimpner, one
time assistant German state's at
torney in Berlin but now an Amer
ican citizen living at Lansdowne,
Pa., was the lawyer. Today he was
a prosecution attorney, handling the
case against Frick as other Ameri
can prosecutors, military and ci
vilian, had done against other de
fendants.
Kempner while in Berlin sought
to force the dissolution of the Nazi
party before it attained power. Af
ter Hitler became chancellor Kemp
ner was sent to concentration camp.

! Frick personally deprived him of
' German citizenship in 1935. He es-
I caped Germany and last year be
came an American citizen.
| Speaking with a thick German
i accent, Kempner painted Frick as
| one of the three key men—the oth
\ ers were Hitler and Reichsmarshal
Herman Goering — who prepared
| Germany for war. It was when
J Frick, a veteran Nazi party mem
j ber, was Minister of Interior to
Thuringia that he used his position
I to obtain Austrian Hitler German
citizenship, Kempner charged.
NUERNBERG, Jan. 16 (UP).—
Admiral Nicholas Horthy, former
regent of Axis Hungary, today said
he had never made an agreement
with Adolf Hitler to permit German
troops to enter his country, and
that he tried to surrender Hungary
to the Allies.
Horthy, in an interview with the
United Press, said he rejected Hit
ler's demands to permit German
troops to enter Hungary, and that
his family was kidnaped by the
Germans when he tried to surren
der Hungary to the Allies.
"Foreign Minister Joachim von
bentrop asked me to issue a com
munique saying that the entry of
the Germans was being made by
agreement between me and Hitler,"
Horthy said. "Naturally I refused."
Ribbentrop asked me to issue a com
j issue the communique. I told him
that would be a rank lie.
"'Of course,' Ribbentrop said,
'sometimes one must lie or there
will be greater difficulties.' "
Looking fit after seven months'
imprisonment by the Germans and
seven months by the Allies in the
witness wing of Nuernberg prison,
Horthy admitted "dreadful and
shocking" things happened when
Hungarian troops invaded Yugo
slavia, but he said he had caused
I those responsible to be punished.
