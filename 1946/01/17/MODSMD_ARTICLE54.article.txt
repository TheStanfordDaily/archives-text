After a thoroughly disgusting '32
i season the Stanford cagers came
! back in '33 to have another disgust
| ing season. This time though they
did manage to escape the haunts of
I the cellar by nosing out a weak
| Bruin team.
"Vow Boy" Keith Topping led the
j parade of stars of the Stanford
| quintet. From his forward slot, Mr.
! Topping not only led the basket
makers but also was a smoothie in
| ball handling. Pairing with him in
i the front were Captain Tom
J Cordy, a fighting decisive mite at
ihe other forward spot, and Hal
Edelen, beanpole pivot man. At the
guard positions were John Hancock
; (no connection with the earlier
one), a long shot artist, and Jay
Tod, unheralded defensive stalwart.
Midwest Trip Dismal
The boys began their play with
j a little Midwestern jaunt to find
j out how the boys back there played.
They found out all right. The In
l dians did manage to salvage 2 scalps
j from 13 intended victims. Undaunt-
I ed, the boys took on the Bay Area
i boys and managed to break fairly
! even.
The opening games with the Tro
! Jans resulted in two victories for
the U.S.C. boys but gave hope to
! the losers, for the Trojans eked out
; wins only to the tune of 38-36 and
! 30-25. Next on the agenda were
the mighty California Bears and
' they were mighty. Stanford met
| some Bear guy named Eifert and
Eifert won by scoring 17 points and
leading the Cal team on to a 37-22
' victory.
Cordy Sparks Defense
Next game the Bruins and a ti
, tanic struggle for the cellar posi
tion. Nothing was solved though for
j the teams split the series, Stanford
j taking the second tiff 44-36 after
j the Uclans had garnered the initial
contest 41 to 38. Topping once again
was the big gun for the Reds by
sinking 14 pointers. Cordy also con
tinued to spark defensive play.
Eifert came to town again and
j the Indians went down to another
| defeat to the pestiferous Boars. No
match for the Bears and playing a
j stale game, the Stanford quintet
i took a 28-18 drubbing.
Next the Indians went down to
j tussle with the Conference leaders

I and eventual winners, ihe terrific
Trojans. Once again the cards were
1 stacked against the Cards and they'
! suffered two setbacks, 36-28 and
j 34-13. Topping was making points
i but not enough of them.
j Cards Edge Bruins
Lastly the important encounters
! came with the U.C.L.A. Bruins,
j Here was the settling fight for the
cellar. This time the Indians came
j through. Fighting to the last whistle
j the Stanford quintet managed to
ooze through to 40-38 and 41-3(5.
. The cellar spot's sole claimant were
the Bruins. The last game found the
Bears tacking on another defeat,
| 41-23.
Final score: Won 3, lost 8. (Wait
! till we get to Luisetti.)

"Vow Boy" Keith Topping led the
j parade of stars of the Stanford
| quintet. From his forward slot, Mr.
! Topping not only led the basket
makers but also was a smoothie in
| ball handling. Pairing with him in
i the front were Captain Tom
J Cordy, a fighting decisive mite at
ihe other forward spot, and Hal
Edelen, beanpole pivot man. At the
guard positions were John Hancock
; (no connection with the earlier
one), a long shot artist, and Jay
Tod, unheralded defensive stalwart.
Midwest Trip Dismal
The boys began their play with
j a little Midwestern jaunt to find
j out how the boys back there played.
They found out all right. The In
l dians did manage to salvage 2 scalps
j from 13 intended victims. Undaunt-
I ed, the boys took on the Bay Area
i boys and managed to break fairly
! even.
The opening games with the Tro
! Jans resulted in two victories for
the U.S.C. boys but gave hope to
! the losers, for the Trojans eked out
; wins only to the tune of 38-36 and
! 30-25. Next on the agenda were
the mighty California Bears and
' they were mighty. Stanford met
| some Bear guy named Eifert and
Eifert won by scoring 17 points and
leading the Cal team on to a 37-22
' victory.
Cordy Sparks Defense
Next game the Bruins and a ti
, tanic struggle for the cellar posi
tion. Nothing was solved though for
j the teams split the series, Stanford
j taking the second tiff 44-36 after
j the Uclans had garnered the initial
contest 41 to 38. Topping once again
was the big gun for the Reds by
sinking 14 pointers. Cordy also con
tinued to spark defensive play.
Eifert came to town again and
j the Indians went down to another
| defeat to the pestiferous Boars. No
match for the Bears and playing a
j stale game, the Stanford quintet
i took a 28-18 drubbing.
Next the Indians went down to
j tussle with the Conference leaders

I and eventual winners, ihe terrific
Trojans. Once again the cards were
1 stacked against the Cards and they'
! suffered two setbacks, 36-28 and
j 34-13. Topping was making points
i but not enough of them.
j Cards Edge Bruins
Lastly the important encounters
! came with the U.C.L.A. Bruins,
j Here was the settling fight for the
cellar. This time the Indians came
j through. Fighting to the last whistle
j the Stanford quintet managed to
ooze through to 40-38 and 41-3(5.
. The cellar spot's sole claimant were
the Bruins. The last game found the
Bears tacking on another defeat,
| 41-23.
Final score: Won 3, lost 8. (Wait
