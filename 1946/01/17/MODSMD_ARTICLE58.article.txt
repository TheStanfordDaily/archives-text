# Indian Cagers Meet Bruins in Key Series
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Prediction: By Saturday night
the famine of victories for either
Stanford or U.C.L.A. should come to
an end. For this week-end's cage
game at the Pavilion between the
Farm and invading Californians (yo'
all branch) has all the earmarks of
two separate and distinct dogfights.
True, there is none of the "Big
Game" atmosphere that always pre
vails when the Injuns play Berkeley
Normal; nevertheless the winless
drought is enough to make both
squads turn in performances that
are over their heads.
Murphy's Condition Uncertain
The news from this end continues
to be good, with only the slightest
w

of pessimistic overtones. In the pal
est of pink inks we write that Tom
Murphy has come up with a slight
ly sprained ankle. Nothing* serious,
though; we hope, we hope, we hope.
For tonight, Coaches Everett Dean
and Fordy Anderson have carded a
slight workout for the team, a ta
pering off from last night's snappy
scrimmage.
U.C.L.A. Here Tomorrow
The Bruins will show up hei'e
tomorrow morning, Coach Wilbur
Johns and staff, 13 players, and bas
ketball pump. The starting lineup
tentatively includes Owen Stewart
and Chuck Cluska (keep your eye
on this guy) at forwards, Dick

Hough at center, and George Eng
lund (who tries his hand at filling
all-coaster Bub Arnold's shoes) and
ex-Farmhand Chuck Stewart at
guard.
The Cards will counter with (also
tentatively) Jim Hill and Jack Mer
edith at forwards, either Murphy or
Bill O'Brien at the pivot, and Bill
Christiansen and Gene Martin cov
ering the backeourt.
Bruins Miss Arnold *
The loss of Bob Arnold has not
caused any untold grief in the Uc
lan camp. While the Bruin would
rather have him in there Friday
and Saturday nights, the team may
take it upon themselves to make up
for his loss. If that happens, the
Farm will have its hands full, and
it may be just what the visitors
need to start them clicking.
The JayVees try again in the pre
lims both nights, taking on Menlo
J.C. Friday and Palo Alto High
Saturday.

Bill O'Brien at the pivot, and Bill

Bruins Miss Arnold *
The loss of Bob Arnold has not
caused any untold grief in the Uc
lan camp. While the Bruin would
rather have him in there Friday
and Saturday nights, the team may
take it upon themselves to make up
for his loss. If that happens, the
Farm will have its hands full, and
it may be just what the visitors
need to start them clicking.
The JayVees try again in the pre
lims both nights, taking on Menlo
J.C. Friday and Palo Alto High
Saturday.

Prediction: By Saturday night
the famine of victories for either
Stanford or U.C.L.A. should come to
an end. For this week-end's cage
game at the Pavilion between the
Farm and invading Californians (yo'
all branch) has all the earmarks of
two separate and distinct dogfights.
True, there is none of the "Big
Game" atmosphere that always pre
vails when the Injuns play Berkeley
Normal; nevertheless the winless
drought is enough to make both
squads turn in performances that
are over their heads.
Murphy's Condition Uncertain
The news from this end continues
to be good, with only the slightest
w

of pessimistic overtones. In the pal
est of pink inks we write that Tom
Murphy has come up with a slight
ly sprained ankle. Nothing* serious,
though; we hope, we hope, we hope.
For tonight, Coaches Everett Dean
and Fordy Anderson have carded a
slight workout for the team, a ta
pering off from last night's snappy
scrimmage.
U.C.L.A. Here Tomorrow
The Bruins will show up hei'e
tomorrow morning, Coach Wilbur
Johns and staff, 13 players, and bas
ketball pump. The starting lineup
tentatively includes Owen Stewart
and Chuck Cluska (keep your eye
on this guy) at forwards, Dick

Hough at center, and George Eng
lund (who tries his hand at filling
all-coaster Bub Arnold's shoes) and
ex-Farmhand Chuck Stewart at
guard.
The Cards will counter with (also
tentatively) Jim Hill and Jack Mer
edith at forwards, either Murphy or
Bill O'Brien at the pivot, and Bill
Christiansen and Gene Martin cov
ering the backeourt.
