# Frankel Publishes Book On Life of Roman Poet
## 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
In his latest book, "Ovid: A Poet
Between Two Worlds," Hermann
Frankel, professor of classics, de
scribes the life of Ovid, the Latin
poet who wrote classic myths of
man's transformation into animals
and taught Roman people the art of
love.
By tracing the changes from the
early idealism in Ovid's love po
ems to his brilliant masterpiece
of ancient mythology, "Metamor
phoses," and finally to his lonely
frettings after his exile from
Home, Mr. Frankel attempts to
clear up the ideas which arc gen
erally current about the poet. Mr.
Frankel sets out to re-establish
the prestige and popularity of the
Roman who in the thirteenth ccn
turv was rated as high as Vergil
and Horace.
Against the background of the
rapidly degenerating Roman empire
Ovid writes "at the turn of the
ages, between the wonderful self
contained world of Antiquity and
that newer one which was to bring
Christianity and a different civili
zation, but began with empty disil
lusion and dumb, hopeless confu
sion." His writings reflect the su
perstitions and forces of the old
along with the emerging elements
of the new world.
A Roman knight by right of
birth, Ovid refuted his early rhct

oric training for a life devoted to
the Muse. Ilis first book. "Amo
res," contained a poem which has
served as an inspiration down
through the centuries. In it Ovid
contrasts love under the stars
with endless labor under the mer
ciless light of day by Interweaving
the mythical legend of Aurora
with realistic comparisons of night
and day.
His masterpiece, "Metamorpho
ses," was a departure from his usual
field of exaggerated emotions and
sentiments to a narrative style with
definite portrayals and plots. It is
in these traditional stories of trans
formations that, acccording to Mr.
Frankel, Ovid "gave ancient myth
ology its unexcelled, final compre
hensive expression.
"There is no literary work in
which the modern reader can find
the pantheon of antiquity repre
sented with equal fidelity or com
pleteness, or with a comparable
charm and briskness."
When "Metamorphoses" was
nearly completed, a decree by
Augustus banishing Ovid forever
from his beloved Rome for under
mining public morality with his
"The Art of Love" sentenced him
to nine years of loneliness and
unhappiness at Tomis, a port on
the Black Sea. Most of his poetry
at this time was an expression of
protest and contempt for his place
of exile, such as in the nine vol
umes of "Epistles of Gloom" and
"Epistles from the Rlack Sea
Shore." His works show a definite
decline in his last years, although
some of his elegies did display a
wisdom which only bitter experi
ence could mature.
Mr. Frankel has not attempted to
make Ovid another Vergil. He quite
clearly brings out the poet's defi
ciencies. But he does explain with
great accuracy the relationship be
tween Ovid's writings and life, and
the reader need not be a student of
the classics to understand the dis
;ussion.
