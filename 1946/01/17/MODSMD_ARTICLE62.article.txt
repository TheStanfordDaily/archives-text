# Visiting Chinese Teacher Plans To Aid Learning in Her Land
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
After fourteen months of exten
sive study of the educational facili
ties of the United States, Dr. Mei-
Yun Li, one of China's foremost
women educators, is visiting Stan
ford preparatory to her return to her
native country where she will as
sume the position of Dean of Women
in the University of Nanking. Her
knowledge will be employed toward
aiding the rebirth of her country as
a great cultural power.
Since Dr. Li's work in China will
be primarily administrative, she is
preparing herself in all fields of
learning, giving special attention to
rural education and home econom
ics. Under the supervision of gov
ernmental and educational agencies
in Washington, she is touring select
ed states to observe education at
work.
The highest scholastic degrees in
both China and this country have
been earned by Dr. Li. She received
the A.B. and M.A. from institutions
in her native country. During the
conflict in China she served as prin
cipal of three secondary schools. Af
ter coming to the United States in
1940 she earned the second M.A. at
the University of Rochester, N.Y.,
and in the spring of last year Miss
Li received her Ph.D. in education
at Cornell University.
"My chief interest on my return
to China will be to help initiate plans
to make more universities and ju
nior colleges available for all Chi
nese students," explained Dr. Li.
'Education in China, up to this time,
has always been too expensive for
the majority to benefit from it.
This Chinese scholar stated, how
ever, that vocational schools where
board and room, tuition, clothes,
books and even a small allowance

are provided by the government have
been established since China has
awakened to her need for mass edu
cation. Although there are compul
sory education laws in China, a stu
dent may leave school after only six
years of schooling.
Dr. Li believes that the main dif
ference between the Chinese and
American student is that the Chinese
student is prone to take his studies
more seriously. "A Chinese student
will study diligently seven days a
week, while an American student
gets more enjoyment out of life by
resting on the weekend," commented
Dr. Li. "I think the ideal situation
would be to get the Chinese student
to relax a little more, and the Amer
ican student to work a little harder."
In China a student, whether man
or woman, places the preparation for
a future career foremost. Dr. Li stat
ed that any plans for marriage or a
family are subordinated by the Chi
nese student to his main goal.
In her travels across the country,
Dr. Li has asked for unwanted text
books. "You have no idea," she
said, "how completely destitute Chi
nese schools are. They have noth
ing!" Universities were moved to
Free China when the Japanese ap
peared in their locality, and many
times were forced to move again
with a new Japanese thrust. Al

though high schools were not moved
to new locations as were the uni
versities, these lower schools sprung
up wherever the need for them was
felt.
One is impressed immediately that
China's lady of letters enjoys life
as much as she does seeking knowl
edge. She possesses an engaging per
sonality and a sparkling sense of
humor.
Dr. Li has never forsaken her na
tive dress throughout her five years'
stay in this country. When unable
to find a new dress in the Chinese
pattern, Dr. Li makes her own.
"Fashions change in China just as
in America," Mei-Yun Li said. "In
our estimation, a Chinese girl is at
her loveliest in a gown of beautiful
cloth, a jade piece around her neck,
and when she carries herself with
grace. This is beauty as we see it
in our country."

the majority to benefit from it.
This Chinese scholar stated, how
ever, that vocational schools where
board and room, tuition, clothes,
books and even a small allowance

are provided by the government have
been established since China has
awakened to her need for mass edu

sory education laws in China, a stu
dent may leave school after only six
years of schooling.
Dr. Li believes that the main dif
ference between the Chinese and
American student is that the Chinese
student is prone to take his studies
more seriously. "A Chinese student
will study diligently seven days a
week, while an American student
gets more enjoyment out of life by
resting on the weekend," commented
Dr. Li. "I think the ideal situation
would be to get the Chinese student
to relax a little more, and the Amer
ican student to work a little harder."
In China a student, whether man
or woman, places the preparation for
a future career foremost. Dr. Li stat
ed that any plans for marriage or a
family are subordinated by the Chi
nese student to his main goal.
In her travels across the country,
Dr. Li has asked for unwanted text
books. "You have no idea," she
said, "how completely destitute Chi
nese schools are. They have noth
ing!" Universities were moved to
Free China when the Japanese ap
peared in their locality, and many
times were forced to move again
with a new Japanese thrust. Al

though high schools were not moved
to new locations as were the uni
versities, these lower schools sprung
up wherever the need for them was
felt.
One is impressed immediately that
China's lady of letters enjoys life
as much as she does seeking knowl
edge. She possesses an engaging per
sonality and a sparkling sense of
humor.
Dr. Li has never forsaken her na
tive dress throughout her five years'
stay in this country. When unable
to find a new dress in the Chinese
pattern, Dr. Li makes her own.
"Fashions change in China just as
in America," Mei-Yun Li said. "In
our estimation, a Chinese girl is at
her loveliest in a gown of beautiful
cloth, a jade piece around her neck,
and when she carries herself with
grace. This is beauty as we see it
in our country."
After fourteen months of exten
sive study of the educational facili
ties of the United States, Dr. Mei-
Yun Li, one of China's foremost
women educators, is visiting Stan
ford preparatory to her return to her
native country where she will as
sume the position of Dean of Women
in the University of Nanking. Her
knowledge will be employed toward
aiding the rebirth of her country as
a great cultural power.
Since Dr. Li's work in China will
be primarily administrative, she is
preparing herself in all fields of
learning, giving special attention to
rural education and home econom
ics. Under the supervision of gov
ernmental and educational agencies
in Washington, she is touring select
ed states to observe education at
work.
The highest scholastic degrees in
both China and this country have
been earned by Dr. Li. She received
the A.B. and M.A. from institutions
in her native country. During the
conflict in China she served as prin
cipal of three secondary schools. Af
ter coming to the United States in
1940 she earned the second M.A. at
the University of Rochester, N.Y.,
and in the spring of last year Miss
Li received her Ph.D. in education
at Cornell University.
"My chief interest on my return
to China will be to help initiate plans
to make more universities and ju
