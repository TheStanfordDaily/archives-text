(UP). —American and British air
lines have reached "agreement in
principle" on the future use of lend
lease bases in the North Atlantic, it
was announced tonight at the Ber
muda Civil Aviation Conference.
Delegates said, however, that
there were many details to be
worked out concerning individual
bases and many technical prob
lems to be solved.

would be no closure of any bases to

After agreeing on the broad pol
icy, the conferees began discuss
ing lite individual fields; Kindlcy
field, Bermuda; Atkinson field,
British Guiana; Bean field, Santa
Lucia; Vernon and Palisadocs
fields, Jamaica; Coolidge field,
Antigua; Waller, Planco and Carl
son fields, Trinidad, and MacKcn
zie field, British Guiana.
A high-ranking military adviser to
the American delegation said the
United States intends to see that ci
vilian use docs not nullify the value
of the bases as military outposts.
Vice Adm. Forrest P. Sherman,
naval adviser to the American del
egates. said he was confident a set
tlement would be reached permit
ting airlines of both the United
States and Great Britain to use
the great Atlantic fields which
proved so valuable during the war
in the anti-submarine campaign.
Military problems probably will
be less difficult, than those of air
line rates and frequency of flights.
At this morning's sessions one Amer
ican delegate said the British are
"unrealistic" and are thinking in
terms of >a few ocean flights per
week, whereas the Americans are
eager to begin 18 or more flights
weekly and at a cost far below the
British rates.
