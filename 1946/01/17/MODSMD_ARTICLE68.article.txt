# Cellar Serves Over 1,150 At Lunch, Dinner Daily
## 
### 
Next time a Nixie whistles im
| ploringly in your ear and hints it
J would be a good idea to go to the
J Cellar for lunch or dinner instead
J of going home to your living group,
i tell him to wait a sec while you re
i call a few statistics.
Remind your friend Nixie that
there are about 1500 or more peo
ple on campus who live in Palo
Alto or elsewhere, and who con
sequently must eat at the Cellar.
Then continue by remembering
that the Cellar kitchen, which is
very, very small, feeds on an av-
I erage of (it! 7 people at lunch every
day, around 500 for hot dinners
every night, not counting the
sandwich snacks.
The first ten days of this quarter
the Cellar served over 10,000 peo
ple, and during 31 1 hours the Un
ion altogether has served 3,318 peo
| pie.
The Cellar makes GO gallons of
j coffee every day, serves about 1200
1 cups of coffee; uses 30 gallons of
| ice cream every day, serves about
j )60 dishes.
Miss Christine Rickcr, director
j of University dining halls and of
the Union, believes it's a miracle
and a real tribute to the director
and the 75 student employees of
! the Cellar that the number of
people served have been as suc
cessfully and promptly waited on
as they have been, especially

when machine (rouble develops,
as it sometimes does, and the dish
washing machine breaks down in
the midst of a crowded lunch
hour.
Also, Miss Kicker mentioned, it is
always amazing how everyone, has
9, 10, and 11 a.m. classes whenever
♦he Cellar needs hashers, but still
the Cellar is always full at these
hours.
After all these statistics, however,
the Nixie will still have a point no
one can deny. The Cellar provides
the atmosphere of college life, the
focal point for meeting friends, the
relaxation needed after a hard day
at a lab, the libe, or asleep.
The familiar breakfast lines af
ter each class, the 4 p.m. rush, the
p.m. cup of coffee, the iuke box
you can't hear, the snatches of
conversation heard while stand
ing at the counter—these are as
much a part of Stanford as the
Reg Dance or the Reserve Book
Room.
Mr. Strauss, the night manager of
the Cellar, has been known to Stan
ford students for over 15 years.
The comparatively new dining
hall director of the Cellar, Mrs.
Anna Reed, came to the campus in
November, after having been asso
ciated with the Yale Faculty Club
and serving as a WAVE Lt. (j.g.)
during the war.

I erage of (it! 7 people at lunch every
day, around 500 for hot dinners
every night, not counting the
sandwich snacks.
The first ten days of this quarter
the Cellar served over 10,000 peo
ple, and during 31 1 hours the Un
ion altogether has served 3,318 peo

The Cellar makes GO gallons of
j coffee every day, serves about 1200
1 cups of coffee; uses 30 gallons of

j )60 dishes.
Miss Christine Rickcr, director
j of University dining halls and of
the Union, believes it's a miracle
and a real tribute to the director
and the 75 student employees of
! the Cellar that the number of
people served have been as suc
cessfully and promptly waited on
as they have been, especially

when machine (rouble develops,
as it sometimes does, and the dish
washing machine breaks down in
the midst of a crowded lunch
hour.
Also, Miss Kicker mentioned, it is
always amazing how everyone, has
9, 10, and 11 a.m. classes whenever
♦he Cellar needs hashers, but still
the Cellar is always full at these
hours.
After all these statistics, however,
the Nixie will still have a point no
one can deny. The Cellar provides
the atmosphere of college life, the
focal point for meeting friends, the
relaxation needed after a hard day
at a lab, the libe, or asleep.
The familiar breakfast lines af
ter each class, the 4 p.m. rush, the
p.m. cup of coffee, the iuke box
you can't hear, the snatches of
conversation heard while stand
ing at the counter—these are as
much a part of Stanford as the
Reg Dance or the Reserve Book
Room.
Mr. Strauss, the night manager of
the Cellar, has been known to Stan
ford students for over 15 years.
The comparatively new dining
hall director of the Cellar, Mrs.
Anna Reed, came to the campus in
November, after having been asso
ciated with the Yale Faculty Club
and serving as a WAVE Lt. (j.g.)
during the war.

Remind your friend Nixie that
there are about 1500 or more peo
