# Acute Meat Shortage Hits U.S.; Packers Strike Across Nation
## 
### 
CHICAGO. Jan. 17 (UP). —The
first pinch of the packinghouse
strikes was felt by Americans to
night as a wave of meat purchases
emptied many warehouses and live
stock shipments were curtailed.
Restaurant operators throughout
the country drew lines through most
meat entrees on their menus. About
the only meat item on menus were
oxtails, spare ribs and sausage for
the average diner-out—and pheas
ant, Scotch grouse and caviar for
the more wealthy eater.
No Relief in Sight
The gloomy prospect o! no meat
at all by the week-end appeared in
many cities. The shortages were
getting more acute daily in all sec
tions of the country.
There appeared to be no immedi
ate relief in sight for the housewife
and her meat-hungry family. John
Holmes, president of Swift Co.,
revealed that the CIO packinghouse
workers had gone down on their
original pay increase demands, but
he indicated bis company would re
ject the new demand.
Holmes said the CIO union had
dropped its demands from 25 cents
more per hour to 20 cents, of
which 17 1 2 cents would be granted
now and the other three cents ne
gotiated when the national wage
picture became clearer. The Swift
president said even this reduced
demand would cost the company
twice its average net annual earn
ings over the past 10 years.
Riots in Picket Line
Meanwhile, some fighting broke
out when police drove through a

CIO picket line at the Swift plant
in Kansas City to let 50 members
of the Independent Packinghouse
Workers' Union go to work.
More than 40 Kansas City police
men drove a flying wedge into the
picket line and escorted the inde- |
pendent workers, who had voted
two to one against joining the na
tionwide walkout of the CIO Pack
inghouse Union and the AFL Meat
Cutters' Union.
Ten CIO pickets were arrested at
the Chicago stockyards for allegedly
violating the Illinois picketing law
by keeping workers away from
their jobs. There was no violence.
Cleveland Rations
Some areas reported plenty of
meat on hand! In Dallas, Tex., bus
iness was reported to be normal.
There was no rush on meat markets
and no lines had formed. On the
other hand, in Connecticut butch
ers reported a meat-buying panic.
They said if the rush continued,
they would have to start a volun
tary rationing program.
In Cleveland, meat sellers already
had started a rationing program.
One of the hardest hit cities was
Boston, where most retailers were
sold out and meat items were erased
from restaurant menus-

ant, Scotch grouse and caviar for
the more wealthy eater.
No Relief in Sight
The gloomy prospect o! no meat
at all by the week-end appeared in
many cities. The shortages were
getting more acute daily in all sec
tions of the country.
There appeared to be no immedi
ate relief in sight for the housewife
and her meat-hungry family. John
Holmes, president of Swift Co.,
revealed that the CIO packinghouse
workers had gone down on their
original pay increase demands, but
he indicated bis company would re
ject the new demand.
Holmes said the CIO union had
dropped its demands from 25 cents
more per hour to 20 cents, of
which 17 1 2 cents would be granted
now and the other three cents ne
gotiated when the national wage
picture became clearer. The Swift
president said even this reduced
demand would cost the company
twice its average net annual earn
ings over the past 10 years.
Riots in Picket Line
Meanwhile, some fighting broke
out when police drove through a

CIO picket line at the Swift plant
in Kansas City to let 50 members
of the Independent Packinghouse
Workers' Union go to work.
More than 40 Kansas City police
men drove a flying wedge into the
picket line and escorted the inde- |
pendent workers, who had voted
two to one against joining the na
tionwide walkout of the CIO Pack
inghouse Union and the AFL Meat
Cutters' Union.
Ten CIO pickets were arrested at
the Chicago stockyards for allegedly
violating the Illinois picketing law
by keeping workers away from
their jobs. There was no violence.
Cleveland Rations
Some areas reported plenty of
meat on hand! In Dallas, Tex., bus
iness was reported to be normal.
There was no rush on meat markets
and no lines had formed. On the
other hand, in Connecticut butch
ers reported a meat-buying panic.
They said if the rush continued,
they would have to start a volun
tary rationing program.
In Cleveland, meat sellers already
had started a rationing program.
One of the hardest hit cities was
Boston, where most retailers were
sold out and meat items were erased
from restaurant menus-
CHICAGO. Jan. 17 (UP). —The
first pinch of the packinghouse
strikes was felt by Americans to
night as a wave of meat purchases
emptied many warehouses and live
stock shipments were curtailed.
Restaurant operators throughout
the country drew lines through most
meat entrees on their menus. About
the only meat item on menus were
oxtails, spare ribs and sausage for
the average diner-out—and pheas
ant, Scotch grouse and caviar for
the more wealthy eater.
