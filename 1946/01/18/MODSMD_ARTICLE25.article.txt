Coupled with Clustka at the other
forward spot is Owen Stewart. Piv
otman for the Wilbur Johns quintet
is two-time letterman 6-foot-2 Dick
Hough. The backcourt men arc
Chuck Stewart (who was at the
Farm a couple of seasons back and
rat»d as very good by Stanford
Coach Everett Dean) and George
Englund, upped from the JV's to
replace crackerjack Bob Stewart,
an All-Coast guard last year, who
was transferred to Norfolk by the
Navy Wednesday.
The U.C.L.A. squad arrived at.
Paly on the Lark this morning and
includes Coach Johns, four mem
bers of his staff, and players Owen
Stewart, Ralph Witt, Mel Stoner,
Chuck Clustka, Chuck Stewart, Ben
Lewis, Don Miller, Dick Hough,
Glen Grant, George Englund, Hal
Michaels, Ralph Joeckel and Alan
Sawyer.
Plague of Injuries
Stanford, still trying to evade the
plague of injuries that put two
strikes on its inexperienced team
before the conference even got un
der way, will open with what, when
compared to the Uclan stalwarts,
amounts to but a thin red line.
Coach Everett Dean has nomi
nated for starting positoins Jim Hill
and Jack Meredith at forwards, ei
ther cx-Uclan Bill O'Brien or Max
King at center, and Bill Christian
sen and Gene Martin at the guards.
Key Vlan
Christiansen, the Farm's key man,
is still bothered by a bad foot, but
will definitely start against the visi
tors. Inserted in last week's opening
game strictly as a measure of des
peration, Christiansen rallied the
Farmhands to drive within striking
distance of Cal. Although no com
plications have resulted from his
playing, Christiansen is still a long
way from his peak performance.
Tom Rodman, another of th®
Farm's injured, showed well enough
in practice sessions this week to
rate some playing time, although he
will not start in his usual guard
spot. Tom Murphy, yeoman of the
squad at either forward or center,
is still bothered by a sprained ankle
and may be sidelined for most of
the games. Bill O'Brien, 6-foot-G of
solid center, still has circulation
trouble in his frozen feet and is
as yet a long way from being in top
shape.
Definite Improvement
The squad as a whole, however,
has shown a definite improvement
in its last two games, and the in
centive of an underdog may more
than overcome whatever pre-game
advantages the opposition seems to
have been blessed with.
Fordy Anderson's B squad takes
to the court at 6:15 on both nights,
tangling with the Menlo J.C. team
tonight, and with Palo Alto High
School tomorrow.
Admission to the games for stu
dents v/ill be free both nights. All
that the B.A.C. asks is that they

is two-time letterman 6-foot-2 Dick

Farm a couple of seasons back and
rat»d as very good by Stanford
Coach Everett Dean) and George
Englund, upped from the JV's to
replace crackerjack Bob Stewart,
an All-Coast guard last year, who
was transferred to Norfolk by the
Navy Wednesday.
The U.C.L.A. squad arrived at.

includes Coach Johns, four mem
bers of his staff, and players Owen
Stewart, Ralph Witt, Mel Stoner,
Chuck Clustka, Chuck Stewart, Ben
Lewis, Don Miller, Dick Hough,
Glen Grant, George Englund, Hal
Michaels, Ralph Joeckel and Alan
Sawyer.
Plague of Injuries
Stanford, still trying to evade the
plague of injuries that put two
strikes on its inexperienced team
before the conference even got un
der way, will open with what, when
compared to the Uclan stalwarts,
amounts to but a thin red line.
Coach Everett Dean has nomi
nated for starting positoins Jim Hill
and Jack Meredith at forwards, ei
ther cx-Uclan Bill O'Brien or Max
King at center, and Bill Christian
sen and Gene Martin at the guards.
Key Vlan
Christiansen, the Farm's key man,
is still bothered by a bad foot, but
will definitely start against the visi
tors. Inserted in last week's opening
game strictly as a measure of des
peration, Christiansen rallied the
Farmhands to drive within striking
distance of Cal. Although no com
plications have resulted from his
playing, Christiansen is still a long
way from his peak performance.
Tom Rodman, another of th®
Farm's injured, showed well enough
in practice sessions this week to
rate some playing time, although he
will not start in his usual guard
spot. Tom Murphy, yeoman of the
squad at either forward or center,
is still bothered by a sprained ankle
and may be sidelined for most of
the games. Bill O'Brien, 6-foot-G of
solid center, still has circulation
trouble in his frozen feet and is
as yet a long way from being in top
shape.
Definite Improvement
The squad as a whole, however,
has shown a definite improvement
in its last two games, and the in
centive of an underdog may more
than overcome whatever pre-game
advantages the opposition seems to
have been blessed with.
Fordy Anderson's B squad takes
to the court at 6:15 on both nights,
tangling with the Menlo J.C. team
tonight, and with Palo Alto High

who has racked up 99 points in 13
in the Southern Division, and is
rated by many Uclan partisans as a
great Bobby Kloppenberg, largely
U.C.L.A. Squad
Coupled with Clustka at the other
forward spot is Owen Stewart. Piv
otman for the Wilbur Johns quintet
is two-time letterman 6-foot-2 Dick
Hough. The backcourt men arc
Chuck Stewart (who was at the
Farm a couple of seasons back and
rat»d as very good by Stanford
Coach Everett Dean) and George
Englund, upped from the JV's to
replace crackerjack Bob Stewart,
an All-Coast guard last year, who
was transferred to Norfolk by the
Navy Wednesday.
The U.C.L.A. squad arrived at.
Paly on the Lark this morning and
includes Coach Johns, four mem
bers of his staff, and players Owen
Stewart, Ralph Witt, Mel Stoner,
Chuck Clustka, Chuck Stewart, Ben
Lewis, Don Miller, Dick Hough,
Glen Grant, George Englund, Hal
Michaels, Ralph Joeckel and Alan
Sawyer.
Plague of Injuries
Stanford, still trying to evade the
plague of injuries that put two
strikes on its inexperienced team
before the conference even got un
der way, will open with what, when
compared to the Uclan stalwarts,
amounts to but a thin red line.
Coach Everett Dean has nomi
nated for starting positoins Jim Hill
and Jack Meredith at forwards, ei
ther cx-Uclan Bill O'Brien or Max
King at center, and Bill Christian
sen and Gene Martin at the guards.
Key Vlan
Christiansen, the Farm's key man,
is still bothered by a bad foot, but
will definitely start against the visi
tors. Inserted in last week's opening
game strictly as a measure of des
peration, Christiansen rallied the
Farmhands to drive within striking
distance of Cal. Although no com
plications have resulted from his
playing, Christiansen is still a long
way from his peak performance.
Tom Rodman, another of th®
Farm's injured, showed well enough
in practice sessions this week to
rate some playing time, although he
will not start in his usual guard
spot. Tom Murphy, yeoman of the
squad at either forward or center,
is still bothered by a sprained ankle
and may be sidelined for most of
the games. Bill O'Brien, 6-foot-G of
solid center, still has circulation
trouble in his frozen feet and is
as yet a long way from being in top
shape.
Definite Improvement
The squad as a whole, however,
has shown a definite improvement
in its last two games, and the in
centive of an underdog may more
than overcome whatever pre-game
advantages the opposition seems to
have been blessed with.
Fordy Anderson's B squad takes
to the court at 6:15 on both nights,
tangling with the Menlo J.C. team
tonight, and with Palo Alto High
School tomorrow.
Admission to the games for stu
dents v/ill be free both nights. All
that the B.A.C. asks is that they
bring their student body cards with
Ihetji.
