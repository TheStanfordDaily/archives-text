# "Education-As-Usual"?

### 
The Campus Opinion letter printed below,
pits o her rather vague, but disquieting rumors
thr. Ie drifted toward the Shack lately, led
to c bit of Daily research on just what steps
St. J ;rd University has taken to satisfy the
nee ; and requirements of the student who
has returned to the campus to resume his war
inter! tod education.
\V< lou.'.Ld, in the first place, that the over
c: 11 policy has always been the consideration of
the veteran as a real and integral member of the
University, with no attempt made to set him
or lila problems completely apart. Realizing,
however, that the veteran may be older, more
mature, or more pressed for time than the
avers js student, the University has made a
number of concessions applying to Lower Di
vision requirements.
For instance, the veteran may take two five
unit history courses in place of Western
Civilisation (12 units). In addition, he may be
cj •t< :I the degree of Bachelor of Arts At
Largo, thus eliminating the usual specific re
qu:: .-nonts in a major field. A "bonus" of units
toward graduation, depending upon former
rank in the services, may also be granted. Al
though Stanford credit toward graduation is not
(jiv* l for "refresher courses"—courses taken
for ths second time —the student will receive a
gn,.V, it will be recorded, and the repeated
courses will count toward Veterans' Bureau
requirements.
Most important of all, the Lower Division
Committee is always willing to consider any
petition requesting a reasonable waiver of re
quirements. Each case, however, is reviewed
on i : -3 own merits, for no blanket v/aiver could
be given one student without contributing to
the breakdown of the entire structure of re
quired courses which have been considered
fundamental educational essentials.
That brings up the whole argument of what
is considered essential in a university educa
tion, a question which is probably being dis
cussed in every university in the country as
each faces its own "reconversion" problems.
Stanford men in the service have expressed
their ideas on this subject in answer to a letter
sent out by President Tresidder asking their
suggestions for post-war Stanford.
The Daily, in subsequent issues, hopes to
print a sampling of their views, and also those
of students already returned to the University,
in an effort to obtain an over-all summary of
their opinions.
