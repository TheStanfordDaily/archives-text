## THE 						EXISTING EMERGENCY 
### 
To the Editor:
To begin with, the Congress of the United States de
cided that the veteran emphatically needed the oppor
tunities afforded by the educational institutions in
order to further the nation as well as the individual
along post-war planning. This schooling was not in
tended as an outright gift, but rather as a sort of com
pensation for the time and energy lost in military serv
ice The theory of the G. I. Bill of Rights was, at one
time, something to which not only the civilian popula
tion of the country could point with pride but also a
document of inspiration to even the lowliest "dog face."
Further, it gave the average soldier something with
which to fight for his future.,
What has happened to this theory? The ideas have
hreii misconstrued by certain universities to read
sonv. hing like this: "The educational benefits of the
'Bill' are still to be earned as an 'extra' by the veteran,
lie is entitled to the benefits only so far as we will
condescend to ration them out to him. Furthermore, he
has not humbled himself, sufficiently, nor has he for
aken the man he created for himself, enough to war
rant full consideration by us. Also, he does not ex
pres extreme gratitude lor the thoUghtfulness of the
ihinkful nation in granting him 'free education'; and,
he has not learned the true value of knowledge."
Pu veteran is led to believe that the least ha could
do is cooperate. After all, he is getting all this for
nothing. If this is what the American people want and
meant in opening a road to the almost forgotten future,
then it is quite evident that the conflict, just over, was
no: won by our men but was just an interim in which
the world was just letting off a little steam and there
: ult was just a matter of fact.
We are not asking for a handout or for sympathy. We
v. :nt consideration of our problems iri regard to grad
uation requirements. For example: Can any professor
?;ive the veteran a logical and worthwhile reason for the
requirements in subjects like Spanish, French, etc.,
other than that they are aids in improvement (which
have probably already been encountered in high school
Latin)?
The specialization most of the "returnees" desire in
law, engineering, business, etc., cannot in the least be
; betted by the foreign language requirement. The vet
eran is eager to learn the essentials that his chosen
profession demands, so far as they have a real basis,

not as just a part of the conditioning and maturing
background that is assumed to be needed by the be
ginning college student. Even the schools that, arose
directly from the Middle Ages learned that the prac
tical had to be as much, or more, a part of the.- curric
ulum as the cultural and esthetic studies donjinant in
the past.
No, we do not ask for a B.A. based on our military
experience alone; we realize the necessity for most of
the prerequisites. However, we do think tbat we need
to speed our intellectual development as much as is
practical. We also know that the school is set up to
run on a regular schedule and that any definite devia
tion will throw an overload on certain departments
and partially vacate others.
Therefore: We ask that some compromise he ar
rived at. And, that the school realize that in a very
short time the veteran will be in Upp&v Division and
that normalcy can then be resumed for the benefit of
the incoming civilian men and women of the usual
freshman age group.
A 17- or 18-year-old freshman can well afford to
submit to the requirements; but the veteran, married
or single, cannot afford the loss of tioie, nor has he the
inclination to go four long years wtyen only the actual
necessities are what he wants and nt'eds. Schools could
well profit by the Army methods /of "visual aid" in
struction and other rapid and efficient methods of
teaching.
The consensus of opinion is that universities are more
interested in the securing of the government tuition
than in the education of the vetesran in the fastest and
best possible manner.
We hope that Stanford will not fall into this category
or warrant such an accusation. It is our belief that to
remain on top a school must progress along modern
lines. If the delays and inconveniences hold up the
pursuit of knowledge whereby our "making of a liv
ing" is impaired, a remedy must be found.
