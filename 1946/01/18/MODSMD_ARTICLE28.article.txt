# OPEN LETTER FROM ENCINA
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In 194U Encina Hall, traditional freshman dormitory,
went all out to do its part to help win the war, as had
the rest of the campus two years before. All Stanford
neophytes were forced to abandon their homes and
take to the hills 'cause the Army moved in. In 1945 a
few freshmen got bold enough to return from their
mountain dwellings and to move in to the east wing of
Encina. But still things weren't as they used to be.
But now the war is over. This is Winter Quarter,
1946, and once more Encina nurtures many new and
returning students. Everyone is eager to restore
the pre-war standards to the Farm; the student body
is reviving the old Stanford spirit—the same spirit
that is going to surge to unequaled heights in the
Pavilion tonight and tomorrow night when the Injun
basketball team faces the U.C.L.A. quintet.
We. too, are trying to do our parts by having an all
campus open house right after the game Saturday
night. We're going to have terrific music, delicious re
freshments, and we're counting on you to help us get
social life on campus really rolling. The Encina Social
Committee and all the fellows welcome you, and we
know you won't have trouble finding the place 'cause
it's right across the street from the Pavilion.
