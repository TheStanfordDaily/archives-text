## SONNETS FROM THE PULVERIZED 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
I crept out of hiding before it got light,
All armed with my cudgel and set for a fight.
The moon was still shining—the fog was still low,
But I meant to crumble the umpety foe.
I took out my compass and cut through the fog,
Sent out fair warning to both man and to dog:
"Till objective's in sight,
I will not swerve right."
I advanced for a league through ditcli and through
gutter,
When up through the fog there loomed quite a clutter.
"Objective" I rioted and paused for a reefah,
"Take hold of your nose and dive for the peeplah."
So dive I did go, and back I did bounce
"Oh, for a pillow in this little jounce."
I lay in the street
With my head on my feet.
It was time for my lunch so I chawed- on the pave
ment —
And just on the side, I prefer Cellah ce-ment —
Scoured my armour, spit on my sword, drew back for
the kill.
I punctured the first foe—he didn't look and guess
never will—
Then charged toward my target and (romped on his
face.
I hit my objective and flew into space.
Blood and gore,
Again on the floor.
I couldn't move—feet were on my face, of courth—
So I let out a whistle and called for a fourth.
Up he did crawl, and furnished the deck—
Bridge was the game 'til he got the check.
That left me shuffling with solitaire.
Waiting for dark that would have to come there.
Then the door was fastened with a lock.
So 1 finnlly crawled to my P.O. box,
I crept out of hiding before it got light,
All armed with my cudgel and set for a fight.
