### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The Iranian delegate is bringing
charges that Russia is intervening
in the north of his country and
demands a fair hearing.
Previously, we quieted him by
telling him that the organization
wasn't completely set up yet, and
the present session was just to do
the constructing. He consented to
hold off, but cabled this back to Te
heran.- His government ordered him
to make his protest anyway.
VETO
Many interesting ramifications
could develop if this controversy
came up. Russia might make the
usual charges ol' absentee ownership
and brawl Iran as a "Fascist state."
Fascism now is anything that does
n't agree with Moscow.
But the calm history of it is that
Azerbaijan, the province that the
Russians took over, is one of the
most chauvinistic of the Iranian
provinces. It has been completely
loyal, and only a Russian-import
ed government and revolution,
coupled with the usual disappear
ances and trips to Siberia for dis
senters, could shake it loose.
A full airing of the situation
should come out in favor of Iran.
This would put Russia in ;m awfully
bad light. It might try to squelch
the whole discussion with a veto.
OUR QUANDARY
That puis us in a tight position.
At San Francisco, our delegates
were promising in eloquent
speeches that the veto power would
not be used for anything like this.
But what if it is?
Our delegates are said to be try
ing to stop its application by the
Soviet. How is somewhat of a mys
tery. It might not be done.
IRAN SIGNIFICANCE
If the Russians use a veto to pre
vent Iran from having a hearing
and an investigation, it might show
that nationalistic thought has tri
umphed over the internationalist
outlook. That was what ruined the
League. France tried to dominate it,
and Britain refused to accept the
domination. The major powers re
fused to compromise their basic in
terests. If it happens again, no mat
ter how well or badly the UNO is
set up, it will not last.
Our delegates have a problem
in preventing the veto being used.
But even if Russia is appeased to
the extent of her delegate. Visin
sky, not having to say, "We re
fuse to have this heard," it will
mean that what the mechanism
has been set up to do has been
sacrificed for the mechanism.
The trouble with any League, or
United Nations, or parliament of
mankind that allows the armaments
of the world to be divided among its
members is that any nation can
snarl the machinery of peaceful set
tlement by putting its finger on its
military trigger. That is happening
here, and, if the Iranian question
ends the effectiveness of the UNO,
Russia will have the dubious dis
tinction of wrecking the collective
sccurily that she fought for in the
1930'5.

and brawl Iran as a "Fascist state."
Fascism now is anything that does
n't agree with Moscow.
But the calm history of it is that
Azerbaijan, the province that the
Russians took over, is one of the
most chauvinistic of the Iranian
provinces. It has been completely
loyal, and only a Russian-import
ed government and revolution,
coupled with the usual disappear
ances and trips to Siberia for dis
senters, could shake it loose.
A full airing of the situation
should come out in favor of Iran.
This would put Russia in ;m awfully
bad light. It might try to squelch
the whole discussion with a veto.
OUR QUANDARY
That puis us in a tight position.
At San Francisco, our delegates
were promising in eloquent
speeches that the veto power would
not be used for anything like this.
But what if it is?
Our delegates are said to be try
ing to stop its application by the
Soviet. How is somewhat of a mys
tery. It might not be done.
IRAN SIGNIFICANCE
If the Russians use a veto to pre
vent Iran from having a hearing
and an investigation, it might show
that nationalistic thought has tri
umphed over the internationalist
outlook. That was what ruined the
League. France tried to dominate it,
and Britain refused to accept the
domination. The major powers re
fused to compromise their basic in
terests. If it happens again, no mat
ter how well or badly the UNO is
set up, it will not last.
Our delegates have a problem
in preventing the veto being used.
But even if Russia is appeased to
the extent of her delegate. Visin
sky, not having to say, "We re
fuse to have this heard," it will
mean that what the mechanism
has been set up to do has been
sacrificed for the mechanism.
The trouble with any League, or
United Nations, or parliament of
mankind that allows the armaments
of the world to be divided among its
members is that any nation can
snarl the machinery of peaceful set
tlement by putting its finger on its
military trigger. That is happening
here, and, if the Iranian question
ends the effectiveness of the UNO,
Russia will have the dubious dis
tinction of wrecking the collective
sccurily that she fought for in the
1930'5.
The Iranian delegate is bringing
charges that Russia is intervening
in the north of his country and
demands a fair hearing.
Previously, we quieted him by
telling him that the organization
wasn't completely set up yet, and
the present session was just to do
the constructing. He consented to
hold off, but cabled this back to Te
heran.- His government ordered him
to make his protest anyway.
VETO
Many interesting ramifications
could develop if this controversy
came up. Russia might make the
usual charges ol' absentee ownership
and brawl Iran as a "Fascist state."
