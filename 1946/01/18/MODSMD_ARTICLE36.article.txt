# ON THE DISCS
## 
### LARRY ERANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Wednesday night over the Ameri
can Broadcasting Company, Esquire
magazine made jazz history. Pre
senting their annual jazz program
which features the winners of their
all-star poll, Esquire succeeded an
bringing together the three out
standing musical groups of the past
year. For a full hour Woody Her
man and his Thundering Herd, the
King Cole Trio, and Duke Ellington
and his orchestra scorched the radio
wires from coast to coast with their
torrid musicianship. The reason for
this is quite obvious when one con
siders that between these three or
ganizations 1G gold, silver, and new
star "esky's" were awarded.
TIIE DUKE LEAD
Kicking off was Duke and his men
with the ever-popular "Take the A
Train." Then Woody followed with
"Caledonia," which had more drive
than the record, if possible. Jimmy
Hamilton, New tSar clarinetist, was
backed by Ellington's aggregation in
a wonderful "Honeysuckle Rose."
Big things are in store for this lad!
The King Cole Trio did one of
its famous instrumental, "After
You've Gone," and later in the pro
gram Nat vocalized his most-famous
"Sweet Lorraine."
There were plenty of solo spots
for Duke's winners, including John
ny Hodges playing some great, alto
on "Esquire Swank"; Billy Stray
horn taking over the 88 for one
number; Hamilton back with more
licorice-stick; and the Duke him
self featured often on the studio's
Steinway. Although some of the
Duke's sidemen didn't pull down an
award, they finished very close to
the leaders and were standouts on
the program. These men include
Taft Jordan. Harry Carney, and Os
car Pettiford.
lIERMANIA
The Herman Herd, which placed
so many man in the various catego
ries, also was allotted plenty of
space in which to show off its tal
ents, which are quite numerous.
Bill Harris, winner of the trombone
award, was featured on a great
"Mean to Me." By the way, he was
performing with a valve trombone
instead of the usual slide. Red Nor
vo, who was voted the 1545 star for
his vibe work and who just re
cently joined Herman; Chubby
Jackson, all-star bassman; and
Ralph Burns, who won the New-
Star arranger Esky, headed the
band in a wonderful original riff
tune entitled "Jackson Fiddles
while Ralph Burns."
Frances Wayne, after a simply
beautiful "Happiness Is Just a
Thing Called Joe," realized her am
bition and crossed the concert stage
to sing "Checkin' Out Goom-bye"
with the Ellington crew. 01' course,
Pete Candoli, New-Star trumpeter,
was quite evident during the en
semble passages with his screaming
high-note style; and then Flip Phil
lips was very much in prominence
throughout the whole show with
his big venor.
LONG LIVE THE KING
The King Cole Trio did not show
up as well as expected, and although
it is simply a matter of opinion,
neither Nat nor Oscar Moore, who
is the guitarist of the year, was up
to par. It seems to us that the Trio
is rather out of place on a concert
stage between Woody Herman and
Duke Ellington; their place is in a

small spot where everybody can be
close enough to really appreciate
their miraculous techniques and
marvelous jazz conceptions.
All in all, the show was a tremen
dous success, with Orson Welles
doing a fine job as narrator. (He
got an Esky, too.) It was a great
help in the extension of our coun
try's music and we sincerely hope
that the programs become as much
of an institution as the artists which
appeared last Wednesday night.
MUSICAL NOTES
Carolyn Grey is the new Gene
Krupa vocalist. * * * Dinah Shore—
another Victor artist following in
the footsteps of Artie Shaw, Hal
Mclntyre, and the King Sisters —has
left the fold and signed with Co
lumbia. * * * Ralph Collier, the
Stan Kenton drummer who made
such a favorable impression here at
Stanford, is due to leave the or
ganization at the beginning of Feb
ruary.
Eddie Condon finally got his night
club in New York on the beam and
opened last month with a group
featuring Joe Marsala, who left af
ter one night, Dave Tough, and Wild
Bill Davison. * * * Alvino Rey and
his newly formed band have signed
with Capitol Records. * * * Louis
Prima, who has been such a success
back East, is on his way to the
coast.
Decca has planned a schedule of
re-issuing one of their old "jazz"
records a month. The first, which
is already out, is Clyde McCoy's
"Sugar Blues," and next in line is
Woody Herman's "Woodchopper's
Ball." * * * Billy Eckstein (we are
checking on the relationship), who
is Harlem's Sinatra, was reported
to have sold over a half-mil lion
discs during the past year. * * *
The Esquire 194(5 Jaazz book is now
available at the Union. And now
as Perry Como would say—we'll dig
you later; hubba, hubba. Are we
square!

senting their annual jazz program
which features the winners of their
all-star poll, Esquire succeeded an
bringing together the three out
standing musical groups of the past
year. For a full hour Woody Her
man and his Thundering Herd, the
King Cole Trio, and Duke Ellington
and his orchestra scorched the radio
wires from coast to coast with their
torrid musicianship. The reason for
this is quite obvious when one con
siders that between these three or
ganizations 1G gold, silver, and new
star "esky's" were awarded.
TIIE DUKE LEAD
Kicking off was Duke and his men
with the ever-popular "Take the A
Train." Then Woody followed with
"Caledonia," which had more drive
than the record, if possible. Jimmy
Hamilton, New tSar clarinetist, was
backed by Ellington's aggregation in
a wonderful "Honeysuckle Rose."
Big things are in store for this lad!
The King Cole Trio did one of
its famous instrumental, "After
You've Gone," and later in the pro
gram Nat vocalized his most-famous
"Sweet Lorraine."
There were plenty of solo spots
for Duke's winners, including John
ny Hodges playing some great, alto
on "Esquire Swank"; Billy Stray
horn taking over the 88 for one
number; Hamilton back with more
licorice-stick; and the Duke him
self featured often on the studio's
Steinway. Although some of the
Duke's sidemen didn't pull down an
award, they finished very close to
the leaders and were standouts on
the program. These men include
Taft Jordan. Harry Carney, and Os
car Pettiford.
lIERMANIA
The Herman Herd, which placed
so many man in the various catego
ries, also was allotted plenty of
space in which to show off its tal
ents, which are quite numerous.
Bill Harris, winner of the trombone
award, was featured on a great
"Mean to Me." By the way, he was
performing with a valve trombone
instead of the usual slide. Red Nor
vo, who was voted the 1545 star for
his vibe work and who just re
cently joined Herman; Chubby
Jackson, all-star bassman; and
Ralph Burns, who won the New-
Star arranger Esky, headed the
band in a wonderful original riff
tune entitled "Jackson Fiddles
while Ralph Burns."
Frances Wayne, after a simply
beautiful "Happiness Is Just a
Thing Called Joe," realized her am
bition and crossed the concert stage
to sing "Checkin' Out Goom-bye"
with the Ellington crew. 01' course,
Pete Candoli, New-Star trumpeter,
was quite evident during the en
semble passages with his screaming
high-note style; and then Flip Phil
lips was very much in prominence
throughout the whole show with
his big venor.
LONG LIVE THE KING
The King Cole Trio did not show
up as well as expected, and although
it is simply a matter of opinion,
neither Nat nor Oscar Moore, who
is the guitarist of the year, was up
to par. It seems to us that the Trio
is rather out of place on a concert
stage between Woody Herman and
Duke Ellington; their place is in a

small spot where everybody can be
close enough to really appreciate
their miraculous techniques and
marvelous jazz conceptions.
All in all, the show was a tremen
dous success, with Orson Welles
doing a fine job as narrator. (He
got an Esky, too.) It was a great
help in the extension of our coun
try's music and we sincerely hope
that the programs become as much
of an institution as the artists which
appeared last Wednesday night.

standing musical groups of the past
year. For a full hour Woody Her
man and his Thundering Herd, the
King Cole Trio, and Duke Ellington
and his orchestra scorched the radio
wires from coast to coast with their
torrid musicianship. The reason for
this is quite obvious when one con
siders that between these three or
ganizations 1G gold, silver, and new
star "esky's" were awarded.
TIIE DUKE LEAD
Kicking off was Duke and his men
with the ever-popular "Take the A
Train." Then Woody followed with
"Caledonia," which had more drive
than the record, if possible. Jimmy
Hamilton, New tSar clarinetist, was
backed by Ellington's aggregation in
a wonderful "Honeysuckle Rose."
Big things are in store for this lad!
The King Cole Trio did one of
its famous instrumental, "After
You've Gone," and later in the pro
gram Nat vocalized his most-famous
"Sweet Lorraine."
There were plenty of solo spots
for Duke's winners, including John
ny Hodges playing some great, alto
on "Esquire Swank"; Billy Stray
horn taking over the 88 for one
number; Hamilton back with more
licorice-stick; and the Duke him
self featured often on the studio's
Steinway. Although some of the
Duke's sidemen didn't pull down an
award, they finished very close to
the leaders and were standouts on
the program. These men include
Taft Jordan. Harry Carney, and Os
car Pettiford.
lIERMANIA
The Herman Herd, which placed
so many man in the various catego
ries, also was allotted plenty of
space in which to show off its tal
ents, which are quite numerous.
Bill Harris, winner of the trombone
award, was featured on a great
"Mean to Me." By the way, he was
performing with a valve trombone
instead of the usual slide. Red Nor
vo, who was voted the 1545 star for
his vibe work and who just re
cently joined Herman; Chubby
Jackson, all-star bassman; and
Ralph Burns, who won the New-
Star arranger Esky, headed the
band in a wonderful original riff
tune entitled "Jackson Fiddles
while Ralph Burns."
Frances Wayne, after a simply
beautiful "Happiness Is Just a
Thing Called Joe," realized her am
bition and crossed the concert stage
to sing "Checkin' Out Goom-bye"
with the Ellington crew. 01' course,
Pete Candoli, New-Star trumpeter,
was quite evident during the en
semble passages with his screaming
high-note style; and then Flip Phil
lips was very much in prominence
throughout the whole show with
his big venor.
LONG LIVE THE KING
The King Cole Trio did not show
up as well as expected, and although
it is simply a matter of opinion,
neither Nat nor Oscar Moore, who
is the guitarist of the year, was up
to par. It seems to us that the Trio
is rather out of place on a concert
stage between Woody Herman and
Duke Ellington; their place is in a

small spot where everybody can be
close enough to really appreciate
their miraculous techniques and
marvelous jazz conceptions.
All in all, the show was a tremen
dous success, with Orson Welles
doing a fine job as narrator. (He
got an Esky, too.) It was a great
help in the extension of our coun
try's music and we sincerely hope
that the programs become as much
of an institution as the artists which
appeared last Wednesday night.
