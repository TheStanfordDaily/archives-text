# Dr. Bloch Tells Work For Atomic Control Group
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
That the job of the recently
formed Association for Interna
tional Atomic Control is to convince
people of the absolute necessity for
.international control authority
and to have them make their will
be known and carried out by the
government was the belief ex
pressed in an interview yesterday
by Dr. Felix Bloch, Stanford pro
fessor of physics and contributor to
the development of atomic energy.
Mr. Bloch stated that his beliefs
are common enough among people
who have even a superficial knowl
edge of the menace of the weapon
which modern science has produced.
The Association for International
Atomic Control is comprised of peo
ple who have such knowledge and
wish to do something about it. "They
are people who don't want to bo
torn to pieces," he said.
Bomb Secret
Science has presented the facts.
The English and the Americans
have shown that the bomb can be
made. Speaking as a scientist who
has worked on the bomb, Mr. Bloch
added that he is certain that within
a very short time, possibly no more
than two or three years, every na
tion will be able to make the bomb.
In Mr. Bloch's opinion two things
are necessary if world disaster is
to be averted. They are: first, an
authority, international in scope,
which would have control of all
atomic weapons, all facilities for
their manufacture, and all their es
sential raw materials; and second,
full power delegated to that au
thority to carry out its duties and
enforce its decisions.
Commission Unsatisfactory
The commission proposed recently
at Moscow by the Big Three minis
ters and which the United States
has demanded be deprived of com
plete power of investigation is un
satisfactory, Mr. Bloch commented,
for obvious reasons. The authority
would be impotent unless all na
tions were on an equal footing be
neath it.
Of course, the chief objection
raised to a commission with such
authority would be the sacrifice of
national sovereignty, Mr. Bloch said,
and not only politicians and states
men would object but many other
people. For it seems inevitable that
an international commission for
atomic control would be the first
step toward world government.
Law Enforcement
Mr. Bloch differs with some of his
colleagues in his belief that the con
trol commission should not use the
bomb lo enforce its power, for if it
moves fast enough it can enforce its
law with the older and less all-de
stroying weapons. A fleet well
equipped with guns could descend
on the offending nation and destroy
its plants and equipment without
blowing the entire country to pieces.
But, if better and quicker tech
niques of production are discovered,
more drastic weapons will have to
be held in readiness.
During the early part of a leave
of absence from Stanford, July 1942
to July J945. Mr. Bloch was a theo

rolical researchcr at the Los Ala
mos, New Mexico, plant of the
atomic bomb project. Then he went
to Harvard to join the staff of the
Radio Research Institute where
anti-radar devices were developed,
Mr. Bloch is a native of Zurich,
Switzerland, and has studied at the
Technische Hochschule in Zurich
and at Leipzig. He has held fellow
ships at Utrecht. Copenhagen, and
Rome and is a fellow of the Physical
Society. He has been a member of
the Stanford faculty since 1934.

Mr. Bloch differs with some of his
colleagues in his belief that the con
trol commission should not use the
bomb lo enforce its power, for if it
moves fast enough it can enforce its
law with the older and less all-de
stroying weapons. A fleet well
equipped with guns could descend
on the offending nation and destroy
its plants and equipment without
blowing the entire country to pieces.
But, if better and quicker tech
niques of production are discovered,
more drastic weapons will have to
be held in readiness.
During the early part of a leave
of absence from Stanford, July 1942
to July J945. Mr. Bloch was a theo

rolical researchcr at the Los Ala
mos, New Mexico, plant of the
atomic bomb project. Then he went
to Harvard to join the staff of the
Radio Research Institute where
anti-radar devices were developed,
Mr. Bloch is a native of Zurich,
Switzerland, and has studied at the
Technische Hochschule in Zurich
and at Leipzig. He has held fellow
ships at Utrecht. Copenhagen, and
Rome and is a fellow of the Physical
Society. He has been a member of
the Stanford faculty since 1934.
That the job of the recently
formed Association for Interna
tional Atomic Control is to convince
people of the absolute necessity for
.international control authority
and to have them make their will
be known and carried out by the
government was the belief ex
pressed in an interview yesterday
by Dr. Felix Bloch, Stanford pro
fessor of physics and contributor to
the development of atomic energy.
Mr. Bloch stated that his beliefs
are common enough among people
who have even a superficial knowl
edge of the menace of the weapon
which modern science has produced.
The Association for International
Atomic Control is comprised of peo
ple who have such knowledge and
wish to do something about it. "They
are people who don't want to bo
torn to pieces," he said.
Bomb Secret
Science has presented the facts.
The English and the Americans
have shown that the bomb can be
made. Speaking as a scientist who
has worked on the bomb, Mr. Bloch
added that he is certain that within
a very short time, possibly no more
than two or three years, every na
tion will be able to make the bomb.
In Mr. Bloch's opinion two things
are necessary if world disaster is
to be averted. They are: first, an
authority, international in scope,
which would have control of all
atomic weapons, all facilities for
their manufacture, and all their es
sential raw materials; and second,
full power delegated to that au
thority to carry out its duties and
enforce its decisions.
Commission Unsatisfactory
The commission proposed recently
at Moscow by the Big Three minis
ters and which the United States
has demanded be deprived of com
plete power of investigation is un
satisfactory, Mr. Bloch commented,
for obvious reasons. The authority
would be impotent unless all na
tions were on an equal footing be
neath it.
Of course, the chief objection
raised to a commission with such
authority would be the sacrifice of
national sovereignty, Mr. Bloch said,
and not only politicians and states
men would object but many other
people. For it seems inevitable that
an international commission for
atomic control would be the first
step toward world government.
