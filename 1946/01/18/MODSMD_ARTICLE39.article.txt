# A-Bomb Aided By Cyclotron
## 
### 
The same neutrons that released
j the chain of the atomic bomb have
come from the Stanford cyclotron
: which is located in the basement of
| the Physics Building. In the very
beginning of the development of the
! atomic bomb work, the Stanford
cyclotron was used in a war project
to investigate neutrons in uranium.
This cyclotron was started in IS4O
j -ind completed in 1941. It was built
according to the same design as the
original Berkeley cyclotron with
some simplifications to (it Stanford
| leeds.
Source of Neutrons â€¢
The cyclotron is used as a source
of neutrons. Before it was in
vented, radium was used to pro
duce these neutrons. In order to
j get the same amount of neutrons
1 which the Stanford cyclotron gives.
r ,ne kilogram of radium would be
I deeded.
The work on the cyclotron project
is being carried out mainly by Pro
j fessor Felix Bloch and Professor
Hans H. Staub. Mr. Staub is still
j in Los Alamos, Mexico, but he is
I expected to come back March 1 to
continue working with the cyclo
tron. Altogether there will be about
j six people engaged in working in
the laboraotry.
! Fundamental Properties
Mr. Bloch stated that they are
! interested in the fundamental prop
j erties of neutrons especially in so
| far as their magnetism is concerned.
In fact, each neutron is a little mag
j net in itself.
The physicists have already suc
| ceedcd in determining the magnetic
j strength of neutrons. This knowl
j edge is important for the investiga
i tion of atomic nuclei. They intend
j to improve the measurements and
1 bring them to high precision.
