Tonight at the stroke of eight bells
the Stanford basketball quintet runs
up against Wilbur John's varsity
basketball charges from U.C.L.A.
The Westwood collegiates are spill
ing their usual hard-luck stories
about why their wonderful team
hasn't cleaned up on the vastly in
ferior teams of the coast. And in
the next sentence reams of advance
copy is sent out about the great
prowess of Chuck Cluctka and his
lour compatriots of the hardwood.
Staniord's record this season isn't
anything to splash headlines about,
but at least the team has been con
sistent, and that consistency has
been showing improvement in every
tilt. Starting out in conference play
against the vaunted Trojans in the
southland, the team showed defense
inadequacy, but on the second night
their defense tightened up, and S.C.
won by a slim margin.
Sparkling Recovery
Last week - end California, ex
pected to win the crown, invaded
the pavilion on Friday. The first
half the Farmhands were just sim
ply unable to-sink shots, but by the
second half, with the return of Bill
Christiansen to the lineup, the
Cards sparkled, and actually out
scored the Andy Wolfe crew. For
the sake of brevity, we shall omit a
resume of the Saturday tilt. We
didn't do too badly, though.
Now for U.C.L.A.'s record. Open
ing against the Carroll Shamrocks,
whoever they might b?, Westwood
dropped their first game. And for
14 more games U.C.L.A. kept on
losing, with two exceptions. The
Long Beach A.T.C. outfit and Calj
tech fell before the mighty Bruin.
Our feelings, however, aren't too
cruel to U.C.L.A. Chuck Stewart,
one of the starting men, put in a
collegiate stint at Stanford two
years ago, before scuttling south to
enter the V-12 Med Unit at U.C.-
L.A. Chuck played on the "hot"
Fillmore Flogger five in the intra
mural race on the campus. Re
member?
Taking our thoughts back to the
'44 intramural team reminds us of
the great team led by "Bones" Hal
sted, which played under the nom
de plume of Roble Hashers. The
team certainly could use "Bones"
this year.

second half, with the return of Bill
Christiansen to the lineup, the
Cards sparkled, and actually out
scored the Andy Wolfe crew. For
the sake of brevity, we shall omit a
resume of the Saturday tilt. We
didn't do too badly, though.
Now for U.C.L.A.'s record. Open
ing against the Carroll Shamrocks,
whoever they might b?, Westwood
dropped their first game. And for
14 more games U.C.L.A. kept on
losing, with two exceptions. The
Long Beach A.T.C. outfit and Calj
tech fell before the mighty Bruin.
Our feelings, however, aren't too
cruel to U.C.L.A. Chuck Stewart,
one of the starting men, put in a
collegiate stint at Stanford two
years ago, before scuttling south to
enter the V-12 Med Unit at U.C.-
L.A. Chuck played on the "hot"
Fillmore Flogger five in the intra
mural race on the campus. Re

Taking our thoughts back to the
'44 intramural team reminds us of
the great team led by "Bones" Hal
sted, which played under the nom
de plume of Roble Hashers. The
team certainly could use "Bones"
this year.
Tonight at the stroke of eight bells
the Stanford basketball quintet runs
up against Wilbur John's varsity
basketball charges from U.C.L.A.
The Westwood collegiates are spill
ing their usual hard-luck stories
about why their wonderful team
hasn't cleaned up on the vastly in
ferior teams of the coast. And in
the next sentence reams of advance
copy is sent out about the great
prowess of Chuck Cluctka and his
lour compatriots of the hardwood.
Staniord's record this season isn't
anything to splash headlines about,
but at least the team has been con
sistent, and that consistency has
been showing improvement in every
tilt. Starting out in conference play
against the vaunted Trojans in the
southland, the team showed defense
inadequacy, but on the second night
their defense tightened up, and S.C.
won by a slim margin.
Sparkling Recovery
Last week - end California, ex
pected to win the crown, invaded
the pavilion on Friday. The first
half the Farmhands were just sim
ply unable to-sink shots, but by the
second half, with the return of Bill
Christiansen to the lineup, the
Cards sparkled, and actually out
scored the Andy Wolfe crew. For
the sake of brevity, we shall omit a
resume of the Saturday tilt. We
didn't do too badly, though.
