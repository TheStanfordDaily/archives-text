## Victory Over Traditional Enemies Was News in '34 
### 808 PECK KEN ROTENBURG 
Another painful basketball experience, the 1934 Farm season, comes
into the introspective limelight today. Just as the Varsity Theater in Palo
Alto drags old movies back on the local screens, we insist on reviewing past
Stanford cage seasons.
Stanford's 1934 team did manage to cause grief for our beloved enemies,

California, so the season wasn't'
completely in vain. In fact, we
knocked the Golden Bears down to
(a point where they were slightly
! tarnished and lost the conference
j crown.
Split with Bruins
Stanford's score with '34 team
started the season by knocking over
the Uclan Bruins, 45 to 2G. The
sassy U.C.L.A. club came back the
next night to nose out the Indians
by a point and we came out of the
series exactly where we started.
Bears "Win One
The highly touted Bears came
down to the Pavilion the following,
Saturday to nip the Indians, 43-34.
Keith Topping was the Farm star
when he scored 11 points despite
close guarding on the part of the
Bears.
Southern California's Trojans met
j the Stanford cagers on the next
week-end and the surprising In
dians managed to nip the Arroyo
Seco boys in the Saturday night
contest, 35-31. Troy took the Stan
ford scalp in the Friday clash, 3G-24.
Bears Make It Two
Hang the crepe out now, for on
Feb. 5 the Indians visited the shack
town across the bay and lost to
the Bears, 45-25 (shhh!). With this
defeat, the Stanford hopes of shar
ing the conference crown went
glimmering.
U.C.L.A.'s cage team made the
mistake of visiting on the Farm the
next week-end and the Indians
walloped the Bruins twice, 31-28,
39-34.
Threatening only in a brilliant
second-half comeback the following
Friday night, Stanford's cage team
found themselves incapable of deal
ing with the week-nd Trojan on
slaught. Troy took the Trojans,
28-22, 33-22.
Season Reaches Climax
The score with '34 cagers had only
one chance of team glory left as
the season drew to a close the fol
lowing week-end. California need
ed two victories over the Cards to
win the conference crown. As the
Bears had walloped the Indians
twice before, they were odds-on fa
vorites to win the crown by pul
verizing the Indians.
A brave group of Farm rooters
trekked over to Berkeley for the
Friday night clash. The team was in
shape and Coach Bunn was pulling
all his resources for an upset vic
tory. Stanford hadn't defeated the
Bears since 1931. and the rooters
who went over to the large Cali
fornia gymnasium had little hope
of victory.
The Indians jumped to a 17-10
lead at half and the overjoyed Stan
ford rooters screamed "Pour It On!" j
Pour It On!" The San Francisco I
sports writers present took little !
notice of the score and said, "Hell, j
the Bears will come back in the sec
ond half and make Stanford look
silly."
Fight! Fight! Fight!
When the Indian squad trotted j
out on the floor of the California j
gymnasium for the second half, j
thunderous applause greeted them. !
Everybody knew they were playing
their hearts out.
Stanford came back in the second j
half and began to rush the Bears
off their feet again. The entire In- ;
dian rooting section was standing, !
screaming. The crowd knew that j
the conference title was lost if Cali- ;
fornia didn't have the punch to \
come back.
Stanford kept pouring it on. The |
Blue and Gold side of the Pavilion ;
was silent. Stanford was beating !
California! The San Francisco sports
scribes couldn't believe their eyes, j
Only a minute left to play and the j
Indians held a 14-point margin over 1
ihe Bears.
Indians Win, 34-20!
Seconds later the gun sounded
the end of the game. Stanford had j
beaten California, 34-20. The happy, 1
hysterical Farm rooters poured out j
on to the floor to greet the victori- I
ous Indian team. The impossible
•iad happened!
The next night California took the
Indians here at Stanford but nobody
seemed to care. The climax of the
season had occurred the night be
fore. Stanford was on its way to

Another painful basketball experience, the 1934 Farm season, comes

Stanford's 1934 team did manage to cause grief for our beloved enemies,

California, so the season wasn't'
completely in vain. In fact, we
knocked the Golden Bears down to
(a point where they were slightly
! tarnished and lost the conference
j crown.
Split with Bruins
Stanford's score with '34 team
started the season by knocking over
the Uclan Bruins, 45 to 2G. The
sassy U.C.L.A. club came back the
next night to nose out the Indians
by a point and we came out of the
series exactly where we started.
Bears "Win One
The highly touted Bears came
down to the Pavilion the following,
Saturday to nip the Indians, 43-34.
Keith Topping was the Farm star
when he scored 11 points despite
close guarding on the part of the
Bears.
Southern California's Trojans met

Seco boys in the Saturday night
contest, 35-31. Troy took the Stan

Bears Make It Two
Hang the crepe out now, for on
Feb. 5 the Indians visited the shack
town across the bay and lost to
the Bears, 45-25 (shhh!). With this
defeat, the Stanford hopes of shar
ing the conference crown went

U.C.L.A.'s cage team made the

next week-end and the Indians
walloped the Bruins twice, 31-28,

Threatening only in a brilliant
second-half comeback the following
Friday night, Stanford's cage team
found themselves incapable of deal

Season Reaches Climax
The score with '34 cagers had only
one chance of team glory left as

twice before, they were odds-on fa
vorites to win the crown by pul
verizing the Indians.
A brave group of Farm rooters
trekked over to Berkeley for the
Friday night clash. The team was in

Bears since 1931. and the rooters
who went over to the large Cali

their hearts out.

Indians Win, 34-20!

the end of the game. Stanford had j

The next night California took the
Indians here at Stanford but nobody
seemed to care. The climax of the
season had occurred the night be

becoming a major basketball power, j
Another painful basketball experience, the 1934 Farm season, comes
into the introspective limelight today. Just as the Varsity Theater in Palo
Alto drags old movies back on the local screens, we insist on reviewing past
Stanford cage seasons.
Stanford's 1934 team did manage to cause grief for our beloved enemies,

California, so the season wasn't'
completely in vain. In fact, we
knocked the Golden Bears down to
(a point where they were slightly
! tarnished and lost the conference
j crown.
Split with Bruins
Stanford's score with '34 team
started the season by knocking over
the Uclan Bruins, 45 to 2G. The
sassy U.C.L.A. club came back the
next night to nose out the Indians
by a point and we came out of the
series exactly where we started.
Bears "Win One
The highly touted Bears came
down to the Pavilion the following,
Saturday to nip the Indians, 43-34.
Keith Topping was the Farm star
when he scored 11 points despite
close guarding on the part of the
Bears.
Southern California's Trojans met
j the Stanford cagers on the next
week-end and the surprising In
dians managed to nip the Arroyo
Seco boys in the Saturday night
contest, 35-31. Troy took the Stan
ford scalp in the Friday clash, 3G-24.
Bears Make It Two
Hang the crepe out now, for on
Feb. 5 the Indians visited the shack
town across the bay and lost to
the Bears, 45-25 (shhh!). With this
defeat, the Stanford hopes of shar
ing the conference crown went
glimmering.
U.C.L.A.'s cage team made the
mistake of visiting on the Farm the
next week-end and the Indians
walloped the Bruins twice, 31-28,
39-34.
Threatening only in a brilliant
second-half comeback the following
Friday night, Stanford's cage team
found themselves incapable of deal
ing with the week-nd Trojan on
slaught. Troy took the Trojans,
28-22, 33-22.
Season Reaches Climax
The score with '34 cagers had only
one chance of team glory left as
the season drew to a close the fol
lowing week-end. California need
ed two victories over the Cards to
win the conference crown. As the
Bears had walloped the Indians
twice before, they were odds-on fa
vorites to win the crown by pul
verizing the Indians.
A brave group of Farm rooters
trekked over to Berkeley for the
Friday night clash. The team was in
shape and Coach Bunn was pulling
all his resources for an upset vic
tory. Stanford hadn't defeated the
Bears since 1931. and the rooters
who went over to the large Cali
fornia gymnasium had little hope
of victory.
The Indians jumped to a 17-10
lead at half and the overjoyed Stan
ford rooters screamed "Pour It On!" j
Pour It On!" The San Francisco I
sports writers present took little !
notice of the score and said, "Hell, j
the Bears will come back in the sec
ond half and make Stanford look
silly."
Fight! Fight! Fight!
When the Indian squad trotted j
out on the floor of the California j
gymnasium for the second half, j
thunderous applause greeted them. !
Everybody knew they were playing
their hearts out.
Stanford came back in the second j
half and began to rush the Bears
