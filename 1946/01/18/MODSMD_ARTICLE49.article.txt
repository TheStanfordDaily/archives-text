## 
### 
The U.S.C. Trojans play host to
! the red-hot California Bears tonight
| and tomorrow night in the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles. These
i two games will go a long way in de
j ciding the Southern Divisoin cham
i pionship, sir.cc the tramr are now
tied for the top spot. If either team
takes both games, it will be odds
on favorite to cop the pennant. A
split of the series, however, will
leave the two teams tied with five
I wins and one loss.
On comparative conference scores,
the teams could not be closer. The
i Trojans beat Stanford 62-47 and
43-32 in a pair of games two weeks
ago, while the Bears defeated the
Indians last week-end, 47-36 and
47-28. Against U.C.L.A., the Bears
won 45-37 and 37-35, and the Tro-
I jans won 43-33 and 45-40.
i Trojan Stars
i U.S.C. will count heavily on their
j two stars, freshman Bobby Klop

, penburg and center Jack Nichols,
j Kloppenburg leads the conference
I scoring parade at this point with 57
I points, and Nichols is in third place
, with 46 points. This is Nichols' third
l year of conference play. As a ci
i vilian freshman he won All-Coast
I honors at the University of Wash
ington, and last year he again won
All-Coast hoonrs in the naval pro
gram at U.S.C. Next week the Tro
jans come north to play the Indians
