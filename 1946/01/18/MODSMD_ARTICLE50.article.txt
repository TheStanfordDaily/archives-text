# Phi Delts and Encina 3E Score Easy Cage Wins
## 
### 
Showing definite superiority over
their opponents. Encina 3E and Phi
Delta Theta piled up early leads
and coasted to easy wins last night
in the 7:30 intramural contests.
In an almost spiritless encounter
in the pavilion, the boys from En
cina topped Jackson Hall's quintet
26 to 8. Tom Pi ingle and Lowell
Troutman pushed the winners out
in front with some nice close-in
shots. Encina then went in to an
effective zone defense to blanket the
Hall men.
With a half-time score of 13 to 2,
Encina felt safe in putting a few re
serves in, but Harband of Jackson
promptly dropped some 30-footers
to bring back the first string. High
scorer for the contest was Troutman
who bucketed 7 points. He was fol
lowed by Pringle with 5 and Lipelt
and Taylor of Encina and Harbent
of Jackson with 4. Bill Edlund,
'stalwart" Jackson sub, provided
lone vocal support in the almost
empty uavilion.
Prince Paces Phi Delts
Ihe Phi Delts also got off to a
ijuick start. Led by Phil Prince, the
frat team was ahead by a score of
13 to 4 at half time. Never behind
for the entiie contest, the Phi Delts
made all their shots count. They
sank a high percentage of their
tries.
Cory was the only standout Ad
ams basketballer, playing a light
defensive game all the way.
Five stalwarts from Beta Theta Pi
proved that the best offense is a
good defense in winning over Har
rison Hall, 17-13. 'iyler was the
high-point man for the Betas with
3 counters.
On the whole, all teams that have
performed in the league encounters
so far have shown a definite lack of
teamwork. But with practice all
squads should improve. No predic
tions can yet be made as to possible
outcomes in the four leagues, but
the only team to show good scor
ing ability so far has been the En
cina Cellar Dwellers.
