# Stanford Players Work On Taming of the Shrew'; To Appear January 31
## 
### 
Broad comedy is the keynote of the Stanford Players' production, "Tam
ing of the Shrew," which will be presented in the Memorial Auditorium on
January 31, February 1 and 2.
The play will be acted as a farce, and the cast is working hard to obtain
the coordination of action and words to gain the full comedy from Shake-

speare's lines.
Tickets for the production are on
sale in room 202 of the Memorial
Auditorium for 90 cents.
Philhrick Directs
This production will be the fif
teenth time the Stanford Players
have produced a Shakespearean
drama, according to Norman Phil
brick, director. Mr. Philbrick pre
pared the script as it will be used
by the cast, and the play will be
given with the induction, which
makes the "Taming of the Shrew" a
play within a play. John Munsell, a
freshman, who was recently seen as
the sinner in "A Highland Fling,"
will play the part of the tinker who
is tricked into believing he is a no
bleman, and thus sets up the inci
dents which lead to the comic action
in "Taming of the Shrew."
Ted Marcuse, a 1942 graduate in
Speech and Drama, is cast as Pe
truchio, the husband who rants and
raves until he tames his shrewish
wife, Katherine. Mr. Marcuse ap
peared in two former Shakespearean
productions by the Stanford Players
while an undergraduate, "Richard
II" and"The Tempest," and appeared
in a total of twenty-eight shows at
Stanford. He has returned after
three years in submarine service to
take graduate work under Mr.
Strickland of the drama department,
although he was asked to tour in
"Hamlet" with Maurice Evans.
Experienced Cast
Katherine, the shrew, is played by
Pat Barret. This is Miss Barret's
first appearance with the Stanford
Players, but she has had experience
in Shakespearean roles at College of
the Pacific. The role of Katherine is
her first attempt at comedy. Miss
Barret is a Speech and Drama ma
jor and she intends to enter the field
of radio.
Charles Smurr will play the lord
in -the induction scene. He is a
Speech and Drama major, and has
appeared in many Stanford plays,
the most recent being "The Seagull."
After his graduation in June, Mr.
Smurr plans to work as a motion
picture technician.
C.O.P. Tranfcr
Rollin Buckman plays a hunts
man of the lord. Mr. Buckman, a
transfer from College of the Pacific,
also plans to be a motion picture
technician. He has had a great deal
ol' experience in shows at C.0.P., and
his most recent appearance on the
Stanford campus was in "The Sea
gull."
David Crabb, a junior transfer
from the University of Colorado,
plays a page, who dresses as a
woman. Mr. Crabb portrayed Mer
culio in a Colorado production of
Romeo and Juliet, but he prefers
the broad comic action of his role in
"Taming of the Shrew."
