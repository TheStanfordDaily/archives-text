# Greene Tells Educational Deficiencies
## 
### 
Speaking on "Some Academic Il
lusions" before a large crowd of fac
ulty and students yesterday after
noon Theodore M. Greene, visiting
professor of humanities from Prince
ton, said that education was not in
a "healthy" state, but, that the sit
uation was not hopeless.
Dr. Greene's talk was the first of
the winter quarter series of the
symposium on American studies
sponsored by the Humanities depart
ment. He was introduced by Arthur
E. Bestor, history professor in charge
of the series.
Lack of Seriousness
In explaining his statement about
education the speaker said that be
tvyeen the wars thousands of stu
dents drifted onto campuses, inter
ested only in social activities and
athletics.
"Universities issued A.B.'s to stu
dents who didn't know how to read
with clarity, think with understand
ing, vote intelligently, or pray with
devotion," he continued.
Liberal Education
Greene also said that he feared the
growing tendency of vocationalists
to think that liberal education could
be dispensed with.
"Inevitably this leads to the in
tensification of the mercenary," he
stated. "I would like to see voca
tional and liberal education comple
ment each other."
Practicality vs. Idealism
The second illusion that Dr.
Greene spoke of was the situation
existing between practical adminis
trators and starry-eyed idealists,
usually professors.
"The institution is healthy when it
has vital tension between these two
groups," he said. I fear the preva
lence of the lessening of give and
take between these two groups and
the undergraduate."
Greene spoke also on the problem
of attaining a balanced academic
diet for the student.
"People are different but they
have common needs," stated Greene.
"It is the job of educators to help
young people get the tools, facts,
and value judgment necessary to
attain their aims."
Students Need Guidance
"We haven't caught the student's
imagination. They aren't a lazy
crowd; they work hard enough at
their own activities and if they don't
see things in perspective it is our
(teacher's) fault. We must take
them into our confidence and treat
them as adults."
The speaker also mentioned col
leges who set up rigid subject re
quirements instead of basing re
quirements on achievement, and the
arbitrary and "rag-bag" way in
which subjects are grouped under
three or four headings.
He said that one of the problems
he has encountered in various insti
tutions throughout the country that
seems to be unanswerable is that of
adequately counseling the under
graduate, since so many professors
seem to be unable to transcend their
department.
