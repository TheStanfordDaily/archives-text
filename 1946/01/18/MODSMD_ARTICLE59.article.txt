# Baruch Committee Plans Aid By Physical Medicine for Vets
## 
### 
A plan for the formation of com
munity rehabilitation centers to help
persons injured in the war, industry,
or accidents has been worked on and
proposed by the Baruch Committee
on Physical Medicine, according to
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor of
the University and chairman of the
committee.
"The emphasis of rehabilitation is
on what the injured person can do,
and not on what he cannot do," Dr.
Wilbur said. "The military forces
and Veterans' Bureau will have to
cooperate with each other in estab
lishing these community rehabilita
tion centers. They would be used
now mainly for aid to war veterans,
and eventually for those persons in
jured in industry and accidents.
Established 1943
The Baruch Committee was estab
lished in 1943 when Dr. Wilbur re
ceived a letter from Bernard M.
Baruch asking him to accept the
chairmanship of a committee of phy
sicians to advise him as to how he
could best advance the field of phys
ical medicine, a field in which his
father, Dr. Simon Baruch, had been
very much interested.
Dr. Wilbur organized a committee
which set to work immediately to
find out what was being done in the
physical medicine field, what should
be done, and if additional funds were
given, what development jn the field
would count most.
Doctors Needed
It was found that the chief needs
were an adequate supply of physi
cians who can teach and use physi
cal medicine, more extensive basic
and clinical research in the field, and
proper use of physical medicine in
relation to wartime rehabilitation
and peacetime physical prepared
ness.
Physical mcdicine has been seri
ously neglected and has not been
given recognition by the medical
profession or by the public at large,
the Baruch Committee reported.
The war has brought about a much
greater recognition of what physical
medicine can do. The field includes
the employment of the physical and
other effective properties of light,
heat, cold, water, electricity, mas
sage. manipulation, exercise, and
mechanical devices for physical and
occupational therapy, in the diag
nosis and treatment of disease.
Research Encouraged
The committee organized a cen
tral office to coordinate and promote
teaching and research in the field.
Then it set about establishing leach
ing and research centers in inter
ested and well-qualified medical
schools. Fellowships in physical
medicine were established so that
doctors could be well trained in the
fieid which had never been fully
investigated.
"Physical therapy has been train
ing people to give treatment in phys
ical medicine to the sick and injured
and a fine job has been done," Dr.
Wilbur continued. "But there have
not been enough trained physicians
in the field, nurses have not been
trained to any great extent, physical
therapy technicians have been in
adequate in training and numbers,

and the physician has had little time
at his disposal."
Money Grants
Therefore, Mr. Baruch made large
grants of money to be used over a
ten-year period for training and re
search in various aspects of the field
to medical schools at Columbia Uni
versity, New York University, the
Medical College of Virginia, Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology.
Harvard University, University of
Minnesota, University of Southern
California, University of lowa, Mar
quette University, Washington Uni
versity, and the University of Illi
nois. He also granted a large num
ber of fellowships in physical medi
cine.
Each of the schools has specialized
in various aspects of the fieldâ€”body
mechanics, changes of temperature
effects, psychiatric aspccts, biophys
ics, and hydrology and health re
sorts.
New Chance at Life
"The use of physical medicine is
making it possible for many people
to get around and hold jobs who
otherwise due to nijuries would have
been bedridden for the rest of their
lives," Dr. Wilbur said. "The Belle
vue Hospital at New York Univer
sity has been giving the handicapped
training for jobs which they are able
to do and in which they are inter
ested."
The Baruch Committee is now
keeping track and reporting the
progress of physical medicine in the
various schools where the grants
were established. Eventually it
hopes for teaching and research in
physical medicine in all the medical
schools and hopes to promote cer
tain general projects for the ad
vancement of this medical field.
