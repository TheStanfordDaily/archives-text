## 
### 
For the first time Stanford Univer
sity received more gius than the "Big
Four"—Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
and Chicago.
In the past year Stanford has re
ceived $3,400,110 in gifts, according
to Paul H. Davis, Stanford's general
secretary. This exceeds the recent
ly received fiscal reports from the
University of Chicago, which showed
a total in gifts and bequests of $2,-
361,944. Earlier reports showed that
Stanford had received more than
either Harvard or Columbia.
Record High
Stanford still would have been in
the middle of the Big Four and had
an all record high even without the
gift of Mrs. Wallace M. Alexander
of $1,284,000 according to Davis.
Davis points out that many for
ward steps have been taken by Stan
ford during his ten years here in a
letter to the members of the Stan
ford Associates marking his depart
ure for Columbia University where
he will join the administrative staff.
Catalytic Agent
David said that "even more impor
tant. than the assisting in bringing
million of dollars in gifts to Stan
ford has been the Associates' ac
complishment in serving as a cata
lytic agent to bring about the re
dedication of members of the Stan
ford faifiily to the cause of independ
ent higher education—the best pos
sible training for Amrica's most
promising youth."
According to Davis gifts through
December 31 of this fiscal year total
$523,900.
