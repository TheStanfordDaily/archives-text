## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
Four Stanford women who were
able to make light of over thirty
seven months of Japanese prison in
the Philippines told a Y.W.C.A. au
dience that the first two years of
prison life was well organized, but
the last months they "lived on vita
min pills and hope."
Elizabeth Silen, Shirley Silen, Co
leen Marshall and Jackie Flannery,
now registered as Farm freshmen,
spoke to an all-woman audience in
the "Y" lounge in an informal
World Affairs talk yesterday after
noon.
Coleen Marshall began by ex
plaining her first contact with the
Japanese. "I woke up at 10:30 in my
boarding school dorm with a Japa
nese guard standing over me," she
said. "The guard was particularly
frightening because his head was
covered with a camouflage net and
bits of twigs were stuck here and
there."
Miss Marshall was confined in a
mountain prison camp until she and
her brother were allowed to join
their parents in a Manila prison.
"The war seemed far away, even
after the December 7 attack," she
said.
Jackie Flannery outlined the so
cial life of a Japanese internee. Miss
Flannery was interned in Manila
when she was evacuated from
China. "We left Shanghai in No
vember of 1941, and arrived at Ma
nila December 2. We didn't expect
to spend more than ten days there,
but on January 7, 1942, we were
taken to Santo Tomas with the
residents of Manila," she said.
Miss Flannery explained that
teachers from Manila were also im
prisoned, and managed to bring
many of their textbooks with them.
"We had regular school, and even

basketball and football games," she
told her audience.
"Professional entertainers from
the Manila hotels began giving pro
grams on the patio after six o'clock
curfew," siad Miss Flannery. "Grad
ually, amateurs began to volunteer
for variety."
"We gave iniie paiiies, and had
two graduations while prisoners in
Santo Tomas." She explained that
records played at reveille had par
ticular significance. "When our fly
ers bombed the Philippines, we
played 'Pennies from Heaven'; and
'If I Had the Wings of an Angel'
was always popular."
Elizabeth Silen explained camp
organization in Santo Tomas. "The
internees set up bureaus, clinics,
hospitals, schools, and a central
kitchen under an executive head.
There was almost everything you
would find in a small town," she
told her audience.
"The Japanese let us handle in
ternal rules," she continued, "and
we organized a strict police force to
make sure the whole camp would
not suffer reprisals from the mis
demeanors of one person."
Food, she explained, was plenti
ful as long as contact was main
tained with the outside. As soon as
restrictions grew tighter, however,
they subsisted mainly upon rice.
"It took a great deal of time to pre
pare food, and even more time when
the food grew more scarce."
Shirley Silen reviewed the camp
housing, explaining that conditions
were so crowded at first that people

. took turns sleeping i-i Santo Tomas.
I "Eventually people began to build
j little Nipa huts on the outside, and
I we cooked, washed, and eventually
i slept there
"We washed clothes in cold wa
j ter practically every day, and at
first there were no irons in the
camp."
All four women agreed that mor
ale was high in the prison camps.
They explained that the Japanese
1 made one rule that all prisoners
must bow to them whenever they
i met. "Some of the small children
1 really had a marvelous time with
| the rule," one of the women ex
| plained.
"The children would seek out a
j Japanese carrying something in his
j hands, and bow to him. According
|to Japanese etiquette, the hands
i must be free for the bow. It caused
luckless Japanese a great deal of
inconvenience."

Four Stanford women who were
able to make light of over thirty

Elizabeth Silen, Shirley Silen, Co
leen Marshall and Jackie Flannery,
now registered as Farm freshmen,
spoke to an all-woman audience in
the "Y" lounge in an informal
World Affairs talk yesterday after
noon.
Coleen Marshall began by ex
plaining her first contact with the
Japanese. "I woke up at 10:30 in my
boarding school dorm with a Japa
nese guard standing over me," she
said. "The guard was particularly
frightening because his head was
covered with a camouflage net and
bits of twigs were stuck here and
there."
Miss Marshall was confined in a
mountain prison camp until she and
her brother were allowed to join
their parents in a Manila prison.
"The war seemed far away, even
after the December 7 attack," she
said.
Jackie Flannery outlined the so
cial life of a Japanese internee. Miss
Flannery was interned in Manila
when she was evacuated from
China. "We left Shanghai in No
vember of 1941, and arrived at Ma
nila December 2. We didn't expect
to spend more than ten days there,
but on January 7, 1942, we were
taken to Santo Tomas with the
residents of Manila," she said.
Miss Flannery explained that
teachers from Manila were also im
prisoned, and managed to bring
many of their textbooks with them.
"We had regular school, and even

basketball and football games," she
told her audience.
"Professional entertainers from
the Manila hotels began giving pro
grams on the patio after six o'clock
curfew," siad Miss Flannery. "Grad
ually, amateurs began to volunteer
for variety."
"We gave iniie paiiies, and had
two graduations while prisoners in
Santo Tomas." She explained that
records played at reveille had par
ticular significance. "When our fly
ers bombed the Philippines, we
played 'Pennies from Heaven'; and
'If I Had the Wings of an Angel'
was always popular."
Elizabeth Silen explained camp
organization in Santo Tomas. "The
internees set up bureaus, clinics,
hospitals, schools, and a central
kitchen under an executive head.
There was almost everything you
would find in a small town," she
told her audience.
"The Japanese let us handle in
ternal rules," she continued, "and
we organized a strict police force to
make sure the whole camp would
not suffer reprisals from the mis
demeanors of one person."
Food, she explained, was plenti
ful as long as contact was main
tained with the outside. As soon as
restrictions grew tighter, however,
they subsisted mainly upon rice.
"It took a great deal of time to pre
pare food, and even more time when
the food grew more scarce."
Shirley Silen reviewed the camp
housing, explaining that conditions
were so crowded at first that people

. took turns sleeping i-i Santo Tomas.
I "Eventually people began to build
j little Nipa huts on the outside, and
I we cooked, washed, and eventually
i slept there
"We washed clothes in cold wa
j ter practically every day, and at
first there were no irons in the
camp."
All four women agreed that mor
ale was high in the prison camps.
