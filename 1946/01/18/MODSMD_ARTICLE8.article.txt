# Eisenhower Forbids GI Demonstration
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP). —Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Army
chief of staff, disclosed today that he has banned all further mass demo
bilization demonstrations.
His automatically carries the threat of courtmartial against any
offender. Lt. Gen. Robert C. Richardson so advised officers under his
mid-Pacific command at Honolulu. ♦

Eisenhowever, who revealed the
ban in testimony before a Senate
sub-committee on demobilization,
emphasized that individual com
plaints are not forbidden.
"But the time for mass demon
strations is past," he said. "With
publication of the Army's demobil
ization policy, demonstrations could
serve no useful purpose."
The order was foreshadowed Tues
day when he announced the revised
demobilization program at a joint
meeting of the House and Senate.
He said then that further demon
strations would serve no useful pur
pose and that it now was necessary
to "replace hysteria with calm judg
ment and sound discipline."
First evidence of such an order
came Wednesday when Gen. Joseph
T. McNarney, U.S. Army commander
in Europe, forbade further GI mass
demonstrations. Today, Richardson
transmitted a similar order to his
mid-Pacific command, telling his of
ficers that "further agitation" in be
half of demobilization "will not be
tolerated." Three enlisted men un
der his command at Honolulu were
confined to quarters pending inves
tigation of their activities in behalf
of speedy demobilization since Tues
day—after point score reductions
were announced.
Meanwhile, it was revealed that
the Army "fully expects" to ask
Congress for authority to bring
women into the regular Army. This
disclosure was made by Maj. Gen.
Willard S. Paul, Army personnel
chief. He told the Senate subcom
mittee that WACs had done such
a "grand" job during the war that
the Army expected to have a small
group of them in the regular Army.
They would be volunteers. He gave
no other details.
