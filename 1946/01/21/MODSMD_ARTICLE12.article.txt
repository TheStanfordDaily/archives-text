# Farm Basketballers Favored to Beat Merchant Marine Academy Wednesday
## 
### 
The Stanford basketball boys will
enter Wednesday night's game with
the San Mateo Merchant Marine
Academy as favorites after their two
improved losses to State U., South
ern Branch, 35-18 and 41-29, over
the week-end.
Farm Coach Everett Dean has
apparently scheduled the mid-week
game at the Pavilion with the Salts
as an extra warm-up for the series
with U.S.C.'s Trojans here Friday
! and Saturday nights, feeling that
the more his inepcrienced cagers
' play together, the better the results
i will be.

Bright spot of the Bruin series
whs the first half of Saturday
night's contest. After dropping
behind l!)-9 while they saw half a
dozen "sure" shots roll in ami 101 l
< out of the hoop, the Cardinals
1 ((A. CA, CAHI>. IN. IN. INAES,

that is) showing improved hall
handling, sharper eyes, and live
lier activities, hustled the score
up to I J)-20 and 20-21 as the bell
tolled off the lirst half.
With both starting guards, Bill
Christiansen and Tom Rodman, able
to play the majority of the time now
if their adhesive tape holds out,
Stanford is putting on the floor its
strongest team possible without
pulling Fordy Anderson oil the
coaching bench.
Ilodman Back to Help Squad
The return of Rodman at guard
enabled Dean to place Gene Mar
tin at forward opposite Jim Hill,
leaving long Tom Murphy and long
er Bill O'Brien to alternate at cen
ter. Jack Meredith amplifies this
sextet whenever necessary.
Christiansen, using a long set
shot and a traveling hook, chalkcd
up 17 points for the two nights'
work. Saturday eve he tried a

behind - the - backboard, under
hand, English shot several times
that was sure to gain him a coupic
of free throws if not a basket.
Where Were Yell Leaders?
The local players seemed to be
considerably cheered up by the ab
i sence of the yell leaders Saturday,
' but it is doubtful that that actually
j had anything to do with their im
! proved performance.
After viewing a dazzling display
of sword-play during the intermis
sion Friday, the fans were forced to
i sit and grimace at their neighbors
Saturday eve for lack of recess razz
ma-tazz. If anyone has any sug
gestions for the coming games, for
ward them to the Board of Athletic
Control, where they will be cor
dially received.
Clustka Leads Bruins
Featuring a "ploughing" tech
i nique. Chuck Clustka, raw-boned
Westwood pea-greener, led the vis
itors' offense with an even two doz
en points for the series. George
Englund, a less feted and less ag
gressive guard, was nearly as effec
tive, scoring nine points each game,
most of them fiorn 20 to 30 feet out.
Meanwhile, U.S.C. and Califor
nia, the other two members of the
Southern Division, P.C.C., were
splitting their series in the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles, which
leaves them in a tie for the league
lead, only five games ahead of the
rampaging Indians.
Up north, Oregon State and
Washington are running one-two
for their division title, and the play
off with the Southern Division win
ner. All of this, however, is not of
too great interest to Stanford fans,
since the Farm should be well into
track season when the playoffs
occur.

Southern Division, P.C.C., were
splitting their series in the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles, which
leaves them in a tie for the league
lead, only five games ahead of the

Up north, Oregon State and

off with the Southern Division win

Bright spot of the Bruin series
whs the first half of Saturday
night's contest. After dropping
behind l!)-9 while they saw half a
dozen "sure" shots roll in ami 101 l
< out of the hoop, the Cardinals
1 ((A. CA, CAHI>. IN. IN. INAES,

that is) showing improved hall
handling, sharper eyes, and live
lier activities, hustled the score
up to I J)-20 and 20-21 as the bell
tolled off the lirst half.
With both starting guards, Bill
Christiansen and Tom Rodman, able
to play the majority of the time now
if their adhesive tape holds out,
Stanford is putting on the floor its
strongest team possible without
pulling Fordy Anderson oil the
coaching bench.
Ilodman Back to Help Squad
The return of Rodman at guard
enabled Dean to place Gene Mar
tin at forward opposite Jim Hill,
leaving long Tom Murphy and long
er Bill O'Brien to alternate at cen
ter. Jack Meredith amplifies this
sextet whenever necessary.
Christiansen, using a long set
shot and a traveling hook, chalkcd
up 17 points for the two nights'
work. Saturday eve he tried a

behind - the - backboard, under
hand, English shot several times
that was sure to gain him a coupic
of free throws if not a basket.
Where Were Yell Leaders?
The local players seemed to be
considerably cheered up by the ab
i sence of the yell leaders Saturday,
' but it is doubtful that that actually
j had anything to do with their im
! proved performance.
After viewing a dazzling display
of sword-play during the intermis
sion Friday, the fans were forced to
i sit and grimace at their neighbors
Saturday eve for lack of recess razz
ma-tazz. If anyone has any sug
gestions for the coming games, for
ward them to the Board of Athletic
Control, where they will be cor
dially received.
