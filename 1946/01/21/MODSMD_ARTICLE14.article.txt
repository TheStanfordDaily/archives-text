President Ed Luce.
The rules, designed to ease frater

will be in operation until the end of

dents to know the regulations.
"We are relying on the fraterni
ties to enforce the rules," said Luce,
"and to keep rushing on an orderly
basis."
The approved rules read:
1. Contact with any man who
has less than 90 units and who is
in his first quarter at Stanford is
illegal. Illegal contact consists of
a planned meeting between a spe
cifically designated group of one
or more such men and one or
more fraternity men. If this rule
is broken, the penalty shall be:
a) The Interfraternity Board of
Control may at its discretion forbid
the man in question to pledge the
fraternity for a period of from one
to three quarters.
b) The fraternity will be heavily
fined, the amount to be determined
by the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol.

men who have been or are regis
tered at Stanford. Only men who
arc registered in the University

men by the end of Spring Quarter,
and 42 men by the end of Summer

throughout, the quarter.

many of the fraternities to hold
rush parties.
