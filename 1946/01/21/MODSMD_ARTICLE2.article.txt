## 
### 
Eyes on the drapes and human
shaped legs supporting the tablesâ€”
the idea is Dali's, but Branner will
go surrealistic Saturday at an after
game dance, according to Cathy
Morris, Branner vice-president.
"It would be impossible to in
vite the entire campus to some
thing like tliis," said Miss Morris,
"so we're limiting the crowd to
125 couples." Women living in
Branner will be given preference
in buying the bids, hut after Wed
nesday the remaining bids will be
put on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
. for 50 cents.
The dance can't be described as
sporty, dressy, or formal, according
to Miss Morris. "Anything will go,"
she said; "you can come disguised
as a fried egg, or just as your nor
mal self."
Hot dogs and coffee will be
served in Bra liner's inner court.
Dancing will begin at !>:;]() p.m.
and last until 1 a.m.
Committee chairmen arc:
