# Farm Players Sell Tickets For 'Shrew'
## 
### 
Rehearsals go into the final week
today for the Stanford Players' pro
duction of Shakespeare's comedy,
"Taming of the Shrew," which will
be presented Thursday evening in
Memorial Hall. The play will be
presented again Friday and Satur
day nights. Tickets are on sale in
Room 202 of the Memorial Audito
rium for 90 cents.
Rehearsals for the show have
been intense, and conducted on a
double basis, whereby director Nor
man Philbrick, of the Speech and
Drama Department, rehearses half
of the cast, while Howard Camp
bell, assistant director, graduate stu
dent, and instructor in the depart
ment, rehearses the other half.
Mr. Philbrick prepared the
script as it will he u*ed in the
production, and only a little action
from the sub-plot has been de
leted from the original.
Duane Heath, a graduate student
in the School of Biological Sciences,
is cast as Baptists, the old father of
Katherine, the shrew. Mr. Heath
will be remembered as the Laird in
autumn quarter's "A Highland
Fling," and especially for his role
in the Gaieties, in which he por
trayed the campus special delivery
man.
Ed Marion, also a veteran of
many productions of the Stanford
Players, and last seen in Rani's
Head's Gaieties, will portray a
comic old suitor of Bianca, the
sister of Katherine, the shrew.
George Kckstcin, a freshman co
median from the Gaieties, will
play a tailor.
All the cast has worked very hard
on character portrayal, and on the
difficult work of combining comic
action with Shakespearean lines;
and according to Mr. Philbrick the
comedy, which convulsed audiences
in 1600, will also strike modern au
diences as hilarious.
