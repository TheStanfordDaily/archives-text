# A 						Time for Charity

### 
Following the end of a war, Americans have
shown a peculiar ability to forget the recent
bloo !::hed and the hoiror and suffering that go
with it. This trait has appeared after past wars,
and the general attitude of the American public
today shows that v/e are coming perilously
close to repeating what history has shown us
to be a bad and dangerous policy.
It is true ihat World War 11, and in great part
World War I, were Allied victories largely be
cause of America's contribution to and partici
pation in those conflicts and the allied cause.
Whether they would have proved to be so with
out oar help we can never know. But the whole
v/orld can thank the American public that World
War 11, at least, was shortened by probably sev
eral years and brought to a victorious conclu
sion by American production genius and the
all out effort of American fighting men.
This is the point where most of us stop think
ing. Because we "won" the recent war, we
think the rest of the world should bow in grati
tude before us. We forget to realize that this
gratitude shows signs of waning because other
nations are confronted with reconstruction
problems that to many seem almost insur
mountable.
When the war is judged in terms of physical
destruction and human suffering, we realize
that the United States, among the active partici
pants, emerged from the conflict virtually un
touched. This can be no remotely plausible
reason why Americans should go on with
"business as usual" and persist with an over
anxious "back to normalcy" frame of mind.
With the exception of a handful of neutrals,
not one country in all of Europe and Asia es
caped partial or total destruction at the hands
of the Nazis or lapanese. The loss in terms of
destruction to the minds and souls of those who
experienced "occupation" under enemy dom
ination is inconceivable. It is to the United
States that these people are turning for help in
recovering some measure of security, peace of
mind, and faith in human nature that they lost
when the enemy was on top.
There is an immediate and practical way in
which we can help these people now. That is
to contribute to the UNRRA clothing drive. To
satisfy this purely physical need, United Na
tional Clothing Collection, Inc., is asking the
American people for 100 million garments.
Even this quota can't adequately clothe the
millions of destitute and homeless in Europe
and Asia. In China alone 200 million people
are in desperate need of clothing, UNRRA
reports.
Stanford's share in the national clothing drive
starts today. The Farm quota is one garment
from each student. Every type of women's,
men's, and children's wear is needed. Closets
of students both at home and at school contain
many clothes not wanted, not needed, and
never worn. Certainly, the majority of Stan
ford students can give more than one garment
each.
Clothes may seem to us to be a trifling and
unimportant means of help. It is true, too, that
international charity in any form is physically
more difficult now than it ever has been. But
we must realize that what has happened to Eu
rope and Asia constitutes a human tragedy on
a scale never before equaled in world history.
This is the first chance that we, as a people,
have had to give direct help to the casualties
of occupation. The means may seem small—
indeed, the cost to us is negligible. But the

reward in terms of good will and the friend
ship of peoples the world over will be inval
uable. —M.S.
