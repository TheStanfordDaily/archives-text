Far more persons than those who knew her
at Stanford regret the passing on Friday of
"Aunt Lucie" Stern: citizens of Palo Alto, who
remember her interest in their community and
her contribution of the Communiiy Center;
children of the Convalescent Home, for the
Free Bed Fund and elaborate playhouse; the
persons who received benefit from her gifts to
the Palo Alto Hospital and her establishment
of the Stern Research Laboratories in San Fran
cisco. Yet perhaps none grieve more profound
ly than the three decades of Stanford men and
women who knew her here, and who through
her interest in them were aided both spiritual
ly and financially.
In the Stanford Room of Aunt Lucie's home
are pictures of one hundred "adopted nephews"
—University men whose undergraduate days
were eased by her help and the hospitality of
her Cowper street house. Not excluded from
her generosity, Stanford professors remember
the parties given at her home before ill health
prevented them. These men, and all who knew
the story of Aunt Lucie, realize that the Stan
ford Family has lost one of its most cherished
members—a person, who without ever attend
ing Stanford fully understood its spirit and
for many, exemplified its friendliness.—B.V.M.
