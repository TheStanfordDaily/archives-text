The tunnel between Toyon and Branner is old stuff, i
It was built in the days when men were men and ths j
windows in the two dorms were minus shades. In j
(hose days it was used as a passageway from Toyon j
to Branner dining room. Now, though, that the pool |
table has been removed from the Branner lobby, and S
the two halls have no common interests, the tunnel hus
been closed.
Back to more recent developments in the growth of
Stanford's underground world. Women's Conference
will probably deny this —feebly—but it has been re
ported that a tunnel connects the B.A.C. and Lagunita.
I've forgotten who gave me this information. It might
even have been a vision—if so, it was a very leliable
vision.
Anyway, this thing—person or vision—said that it
was rummaging around in the basement of the B.A.C. i
one day and uncovered a circular outlet about four or
five feet in diameter. Being a curious person or vision,
it crawled into the outlet, crawled cross country for a
considerable time, and finally fell out a similar outlet
in the Lag basement.
What makes me think that this source of informa
tion was a person rather than a vision, is that it com
mented that the Lag basement had wonderful possibili
ties for a Halloween party—long, narrow passageways
or something.
There's your clue. Will the person who uncovers
the mystery please let me know whether the passage
way was planned by one of the black sheep—well,
gray antyway—of the Stanford family, or if it's just a
part of the Paly water system?

I realize that the tunnel situation on campus is fas- !
cinating, but there are other more serious things to '
consider—such as the liquor problem. In one women's
living group on campus, there had been numerous
comments on a quite obvious liquor odor in one par
ticular part of the building. This went on for some
time, with all of the women in the group convincing [
themselves that the odor was merely the result of some
overripe oranges or fermented cokes.
One night, though, the comments and the odor be- j
came especially strong. It was ;ill traced down to a j
rather conspicuous puddle in one of the halls. The con
scientious house president, believing that the com- I
ments were complaints, called a general house meet
ing. Not even the people who had gone to bed early j
were excused from the meeting. ,
The president came solemnly and straightforwardly j
to the point. "I suppose you all know what this meet- !
ing has been called for."
All of her sleepy subjects nodded except one.
"Someone has had liquor in her room."
An enormous hee-haw and confession followed. It ,
seems that this one person objected to using orthodox j
wave set for fixing her hair. Instead, she preferred'us- !
ing flat beer. It doesn't leave a film, it isn't sticky, and |
it doesn't make your hair stiff—so she said.
The meeting was adjourned with the rather strong j
suggestion that wave set—sticky or not—be used in '
the future.
Helena Eubenstein could make a fortune with a j
nrw line—"Hop Heaven."
