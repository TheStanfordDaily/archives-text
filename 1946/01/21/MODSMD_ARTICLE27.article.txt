Dear Editor:
It's time Stanford came off of its lofty mountain. The
words "high-schoolish," "adolescent" and "young" are
being used too often to squelch a little enthusiasm.
After all, this isn't a super sophisticate universityâ€”it
is the Farm. So let's come down of! of our perch and
get some of that good vim and verve that means spirit.
Sincerely,
Gail Temple ton
