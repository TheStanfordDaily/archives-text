# HOUSING ACTION
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Unfortunately I am among one of the many married
students on campus who are having a little difficulty
finding a house.
An ad in the L.A. Times Saturday advertising
immediate delivery on prefabricated houses brought
to my mind that there are many possibilities for bous
ing which can't be, o rare impractical for individuals
to invsetigate. Even more important, there are many
types of temporary and permanent bousing which
could be inquired into by an organized group of stu
dents rather than by the University, which has made
some progress, but is handicapped in many ways.
Frankly, I'm tired of reading, and having people tell
me how bad the shortage is, and of following the Dean
of Students' "single rooms at $G5 a month" list. It's
ahoul time the people who are doing the hunting did
something about it. Let's get together and see what
we can do!
My P.O. box is or call I'.A. 25111 evenings. If
enough response come in we can arrange for a meet
ing immediately.
Sincerely,
Arthur F. Thompson
