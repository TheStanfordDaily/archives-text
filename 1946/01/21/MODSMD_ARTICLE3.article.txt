# 'Family' Idea Rules Farm Traditions
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
It is not unusual that a young
man or woman should feel loyal to
the university ho or she attends, but
not always is the loyalty accompa
nied by the sense of belonging to a
"family" as it exists here at Stan
ford.
This oldest and most deeply in
grained of all the Stanford tradi
tions is the basis for all the others
from the most important — student
government and the Honor System
—to the simplest—the ''Hello!" cus
tom wherever Stanford people
gather.
There are many reasons for the
existence of the Stanford Family
tradition. The University was be
gun bv a family, Lcland and Jane
Lathrop Stanford, who endowed
it in memory of their son, Lcland.
Jr. In the early years of the Uni
versity they lived near the cam
pus and were an intimate part of
it. Their closcness, the smallness
of the faculty and student body,
and the consciousness that they
were the initiators of a new and
courageous experiment resulted
in a feeling of comradeship which
has persisted until today, despite
the growth in size and scope of
activities of the University.
Set off from the surrounding area
by sun-filled fields of oaks and eu
calyptus, the Stanford community is
a combination of a small city and a
University. It has its own police
force, fire department, post office
and other services that make up the
community life. It has the build
ings, libraries, museums, and facili
ties that make up a great Univer
sity.
Behind the 1500 - acre campus
proper, the acres of the Stanford
Farm rise into the foothills of the
Coast Range. Chancellor Ray Ly
man Wilbur has said that the long
sweep of vision across the Stanford
lands contributes to the sense of
belonging to Stanford. "It is accom
panied by a sense of possession, of
being a part of one of the most
beautiful campuses in the world.
Unconsciously, from the very be
ginning, the students feel in the
Stanford environment and atmos
phere a sense of freedom and of
responsibility to the University."
Not only students and faculty,
hut the donors and friends of the
University arc considered part of
the Stanford Family, for, since the
original endowment by the Slan
supported by private contribu
tions. In contributing to the life
of the University, donors become
important members of the Fam
ily, for without them it would not
exist. Through their aid many
young people attend Stanford who
would not otherwise receive the
opportunity.
The halls and houses of the cam
pus are the homes of the Stanford
Family for the four or more years
while they arc learning the habits
and customs which will persist,
throughout their lives—the respon
sibility of the Honor System, the
democratic attitudes of student gov
ernment and campus life and the
many attitudes and abilities of an
educated man or woman.
In the residences friendships grow
which last for lifetimes and carry
the spirit of the Stanford Family out
into the world.

supported by private contribu

of the University, donors become
important members of the Fam
ily, for without them it would not
exist. Through their aid many
young people attend Stanford who
would not otherwise receive the
opportunity.
The halls and houses of the cam
pus are the homes of the Stanford
Family for the four or more years
while they arc learning the habits
and customs which will persist,
throughout their lives—the respon
sibility of the Honor System, the
democratic attitudes of student gov
ernment and campus life and the
many attitudes and abilities of an
educated man or woman.
In the residences friendships grow
which last for lifetimes and carry
the spirit of the Stanford Family out
into the world.
It is not unusual that a young
man or woman should feel loyal to
the university ho or she attends, but
not always is the loyalty accompa
nied by the sense of belonging to a
"family" as it exists here at Stan
ford.
This oldest and most deeply in
grained of all the Stanford tradi

gather.
There are many reasons for the
existence of the Stanford Family
tradition. The University was be
gun bv a family, Lcland and Jane
Lathrop Stanford, who endowed
it in memory of their son, Lcland.
Jr. In the early years of the Uni
versity they lived near the cam
pus and were an intimate part of
it. Their closcness, the smallness
of the faculty and student body,
and the consciousness that they
were the initiators of a new and
courageous experiment resulted
in a feeling of comradeship which
has persisted until today, despite
the growth in size and scope of
activities of the University.
Set off from the surrounding area
by sun-filled fields of oaks and eu
calyptus, the Stanford community is
a combination of a small city and a
University. It has its own police
force, fire department, post office
and other services that make up the
community life. It has the build
ings, libraries, museums, and facili
ties that make up a great Univer
sity.
Behind the 1500 - acre campus
proper, the acres of the Stanford
Farm rise into the foothills of the
Coast Range. Chancellor Ray Ly
man Wilbur has said that the long
sweep of vision across the Stanford
lands contributes to the sense of
belonging to Stanford. "It is accom
panied by a sense of possession, of
being a part of one of the most
beautiful campuses in the world.
Unconsciously, from the very be
ginning, the students feel in the
Stanford environment and atmos
phere a sense of freedom and of
responsibility to the University."
