# Stanford Mourns Death Of 'Aunt Lucie' Stern
## 
### JULIUS JACOBS 
Aunt Lucie Stern, who died at
her Cowper street home last Satur
day, was an intimate friend and
advisor to three decades of Stanford
men, and her residence a gathering
place for faculty and students alike.
From Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur to the lowliest freshman student
at Encina, Aunt Lucie's famous hos
pitality was extended. Throughout
the thirties and extending into the
early forties, while her health re
mained unbroken, hundreds of cam
pus students attended the small Sun
day dinner parties held at her home.
These same persons, professor and
student alike, were recipients of gilts
from Aunt Lucie's famous "gift
closet," stocked high with neckties,
shirts, sweaters, and countless other
articles which were passed out to
the guests.
There was a serious purpose be
hind Aunt Lucie's numerous activi
ties. Many of the men who visited
ihe Stern home were students with
limited finances. Most of them—
campus leaders, football players,
dramatic students, debators, or pre
med and engineering majors—did
not realize it, but Aunt Lucie was
trying in some small measure to
make their struggle for an educa
tion a bit more pleasant.
Many were the bull-sessions held
around the massive dining room ta
ble on Cowper street. Almon Roth
entertained occasionally with his
famed imitation of a horse whinny
ing, or a campus musician might sit
down and play the piano to his
heart's content. Songs for the Gaie
ties were written there, and edito
rial policies for campus publications
were mulled over by student editors
—with the help of a pitcher of cof
fee or milk and some of Eugene's fa

mous pie and ice cream.
Students were helped out of many
a temporary financial jam by the
Stern Loan Fund made available
through Aunt Lucie's generosity at
the Administration building. Occa
sionally, a large gift became avail
able through her philanthrophy, such
as the Medical Research building
given to Stanford in the late 30's.
In the famous Stanford Room of
Aunt Lucie's house hung hundreds
of portraits of generations of Stan
ford men, from David Starr Jordan
and Dr. Wilbur to the family por
traits of Stanford men and women
and their children, sent from all
parts of the United States.
From Cowper street went tele
grams to all parts of the world, for
none of "Aunt Lucie's boys" was
forgotten on his birthday. During
the war, cables were sent to the
men serving in the armed services
overseas, and boxes containing
cookies and other gifts.
Aunt Lucie stood as a link be
tween Farm students who graduated
and then lost track of their friends.
They could also write her and get
the addresses they sought. On her
birthday and on holidays, hundreds
of greeting cards came to wish Stan
ford's foremost well-wisher the best
of good fortune.
Her devotion to Stanford remained
to the last. On one of the rare oc
casions last autumn when she was
allowed to leave her home, Aunt Lu
cie asked to be driven to the Stan
ford campus, and she drank in the
sights of the campus she loved so
well for the last time.
Literally hundreds of alumni in
all sections of the globe, men and
women whose years on the Farm
were made even more pleasant by
their friendship with Aunt Lucie,
today mourn her passing.

the Administration building. Occa
sionally, a large gift became avail
able through her philanthrophy, such
as the Medical Research building
given to Stanford in the late 30's.
In the famous Stanford Room of
Aunt Lucie's house hung hundreds
of portraits of generations of Stan
ford men, from David Starr Jordan
and Dr. Wilbur to the family por
traits of Stanford men and women
and their children, sent from all
parts of the United States.
From Cowper street went tele
grams to all parts of the world, for
none of "Aunt Lucie's boys" was
forgotten on his birthday. During
the war, cables were sent to the
men serving in the armed services
overseas, and boxes containing
cookies and other gifts.
Aunt Lucie stood as a link be
tween Farm students who graduated
and then lost track of their friends.
They could also write her and get
the addresses they sought. On her
birthday and on holidays, hundreds
of greeting cards came to wish Stan
ford's foremost well-wisher the best
of good fortune.
Her devotion to Stanford remained
to the last. On one of the rare oc
casions last autumn when she was
allowed to leave her home, Aunt Lu
cie asked to be driven to the Stan
ford campus, and she drank in the
sights of the campus she loved so
well for the last time.
Literally hundreds of alumni in
all sections of the globe, men and
women whose years on the Farm
were made even more pleasant by
their friendship with Aunt Lucie,
today mourn her passing.
Aunt Lucie Stern, who died at
her Cowper street home last Satur
day, was an intimate friend and
advisor to three decades of Stanford
men, and her residence a gathering
place for faculty and students alike.
From Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur to the lowliest freshman student
at Encina, Aunt Lucie's famous hos
pitality was extended. Throughout
the thirties and extending into the
early forties, while her health re
mained unbroken, hundreds of cam
pus students attended the small Sun
day dinner parties held at her home.
These same persons, professor and
student alike, were recipients of gilts
from Aunt Lucie's famous "gift
closet," stocked high with neckties,
shirts, sweaters, and countless other
articles which were passed out to
the guests.
There was a serious purpose be
hind Aunt Lucie's numerous activi
ties. Many of the men who visited
ihe Stern home were students with
limited finances. Most of them—
campus leaders, football players,
dramatic students, debators, or pre
med and engineering majors—did
not realize it, but Aunt Lucie was
trying in some small measure to
make their struggle for an educa
tion a bit more pleasant.
Many were the bull-sessions held
around the massive dining room ta
ble on Cowper street. Almon Roth
entertained occasionally with his
famed imitation of a horse whinny
ing, or a campus musician might sit
down and play the piano to his
heart's content. Songs for the Gaie
ties were written there, and edito
rial policies for campus publications
were mulled over by student editors
—with the help of a pitcher of cof
fee or milk and some of Eugene's fa

mous pie and ice cream.
Students were helped out of many
a temporary financial jam by the
Stern Loan Fund made available
through Aunt Lucie's generosity at
the Administration building. Occa
