# Students Urge Improvements For Farm's Rooting Section
## 
### 
"We can't yell without a cheer
leader," a girl on the Row said,
"and there were no cheerleaders
Saturday night. Another girl said,
"It was terrible Saturday night.
There is no organization of rally
committee. Can't we do something
about it?"
These were the answers that were
received when the Daily asked stu
dents in different campus halls what
they thought of the organization of
the rooting section at the basketball
games.
Students were asked also if they
had any suggestions for improving
the rooting section. Varied and dif
ferent answers were received and
several are reprinted here in part
or fully.
An Encina man said, "Why, don't
the cheerleaders have mega
phones? The California cheer
leaders did and it seemed to im
prove Iheir yells. A( least, they
kept together. Here nobody seems
to know what yells the cheerlead
ers are attempting to present."
"There should be sections for
ihose who want to cheer," a girl on
the Upper Row said. "A smaller
rooting section is much easier to co
ordinate. Why not rope off a section
like we do at football games?"
The theory of a special section for
rooters was brought up by several
students in different halls. The con
census of opinion was that it would
be a very good idea. Most students
pointed out the excellent coordina
tion of the small California rooting
section at Stanford two weekends
ago.
"The cheerleaders were not to
gether nor organized at the foot
ball games. Rally committee
should circulate yells so thai peo
ple would be familiar with them,"
a coed said.
"We need some more yells and
songs. Why not an all-campus song
contest? Something has to be done
about ihe situation. It is deporabe
for a school of Stanford's standing,"
a returned veteran said.
"Kids should follow the cheerlead
ers. We need more yells—more in
teresting ones that would catch the
enthusiasm of the students," said a
'il l in one of the small living groups.
"We don't know the yells. We
should have a big rally before
some of (he big basketball games.

"Over the radio the yells sounded
very poor. California's came
through much more clearly," sev
eral students chimed in together.
Differing opinions were found in
our campus poll but everyone ap
proached agreed that something
must be done about the situation.
One students in summing up our
difficulties said, "How can we expect
our basketball team to win when our
rooting section is seemingly not be
hind them?"

ers are attempting to present."
"There should be sections for
ihose who want to cheer," a girl on
the Upper Row said. "A smaller
rooting section is much easier to co
ordinate. Why not rope off a section
like we do at football games?"
The theory of a special section for
rooters was brought up by several
students in different halls. The con
census of opinion was that it would
be a very good idea. Most students
pointed out the excellent coordina
tion of the small California rooting
section at Stanford two weekends
ago.
"The cheerleaders were not to
gether nor organized at the foot
ball games. Rally committee
should circulate yells so thai peo
ple would be familiar with them,"
a coed said.
"We need some more yells and
songs. Why not an all-campus song
contest? Something has to be done
about ihe situation. It is deporabe
for a school of Stanford's standing,"
a returned veteran said.
"Kids should follow the cheerlead
ers. We need more yells—more in
teresting ones that would catch the
enthusiasm of the students," said a
'il l in one of the small living groups.
"We don't know the yells. We
should have a big rally before
some of (he big basketball games.

"Over the radio the yells sounded
very poor. California's came
through much more clearly," sev
eral students chimed in together.
Differing opinions were found in
our campus poll but everyone ap
proached agreed that something
must be done about the situation.
One students in summing up our
difficulties said, "How can we expect
our basketball team to win when our
rooting section is seemingly not be
hind them?"
"We can't yell without a cheer
leader," a girl on the Row said,
"and there were no cheerleaders
Saturday night. Another girl said,
"It was terrible Saturday night.
There is no organization of rally
committee. Can't we do something
about it?"
These were the answers that were
received when the Daily asked stu
dents in different campus halls what
they thought of the organization of
the rooting section at the basketball
games.
Students were asked also if they
had any suggestions for improving
the rooting section. Varied and dif
ferent answers were received and
several are reprinted here in part
or fully.
An Encina man said, "Why, don't
the cheerleaders have mega
phones? The California cheer
leaders did and it seemed to im
prove Iheir yells. A( least, they
kept together. Here nobody seems
to know what yells the cheerlead
ers are attempting to present."
