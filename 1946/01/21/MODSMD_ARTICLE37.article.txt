### 
PARIS, Jan. 20 UP). — Gen.
Charles DeGaulle resigned suddenly
tonight as President of France and
his secretary said that he would
retire forever from political life.
Both DeGaulle's resignation and
his decision to retire were made
public by his cabinet director and
secretary, Gaston Palewski, who
carried a letter of resignation to
Assembly President Felix Gouin.
"Gen. DeGaulle isn't merely re
signing," said Palewski. "He is
leaving his p«fst — irrevocably.
Furthermore, the general is re
tiring for good from political life."
DeGaulle's resignation, which
threw France's Fourth Republic
into its gravest crisis, followed three
months of disputes with the Com
munist and Socialist parties. They
had demanded major reductions in
the French armed forces find a con
stitution which would drastically
restrict the powers of DeGaulle's
,jost.
DeGaulle is expected to leave
Paris to avoid political maneuver
ing immediately after making a
scheduled broadcast .at 8 p.m. (3
p.m. EST) tomorrow. It was under
stood that he would retire to a
house in a small village in the
Marne Department which he bought
and refurnished some months ago.
DeGaulle's letter of resignation
is expected to be read to the Na
tional Assembly on Tuesday, and
it was stated authoritatively that
it would be accepted. The Assem
bly then would have the problem
of attempting to select a new
President.
Intensive political maneuverings
already have started in an attempt
to find someone willing or able to
head a new government.
