"Forty-four Stanford graduates in
education are receiving practical
experience in the local schools,"
said Mr. Alfred 11. Grommon, as
sistant professor of education and
English. These graduate students
are teaching in the Palo Alto,
Mountain View, and Sequoia Union
High Schools, and in the Jordan
Junior High School.
Among these graduate students
are approximately fourteen veter
ans. Of these veterans, one was a
lieutenant colonel, two were Air
Force captains, and several were
lieutenants in the various branches
of the service. Dr. George Ebey,
who is assisting Mr. Grommon in
the supervision of the practice
teachers, was an Air Force major
and wearer of the Legion of Merit.
These student teachers are
working for a general secondary
credential, which will enable them
to teach in the public iunior and
senior high schools of California.
They attend classes here at the
University and teach in their re
spective schools regularly.
Many of the students who taught
last quarter are now teaching every
day. The regular teacher of the
class is present while the student
instructor is conducting it. Each
student consults with the regular
teacher about the daily work and
th°n he prepares an outline for the
coming week's work, which is usu
ally approved by the teacher and
Mr. Grommon.
There are fourteen student
teachers in social studies, four in
English, three in mathematics,
four in dramatics and public
speaking, four in Spanish, nine in
science, three in physical educa
tion, and four in commercial sub
jects. The student teachers re
ceive a good practical knowledge
of the art of teaching, by con
ducting these supervised classes,
Mr. Grommon believes.
