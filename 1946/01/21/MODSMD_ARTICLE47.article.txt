# Golf ream Prospects Are Good—Twiggs
## 
### 
Golt coach Eddie Twiggs has an
encouraging word for champion
ship-hungry Farm rooters who have
suffered ihree long years without
varsity competition. "Our golf team
this year," says Coach Twiggs,
"doesn't compare with the last few
teams (four out of five of which won
the national collegiate champion
ship), but with a lot of work, it will
be as good or better than many of
our teams that won the conference
championship."
McCann Former Champ
Eddie Twiggs has an impressive
list of top-flight golfers, most of
them just out of the armed forces,
to back up this statement. Heading

the list is Frank McCann, former
j air force pilot, who was a member
of the 1942 team (hat walked away
J with the N.C.A.A. title and the in
| dividual.champion of the Coast Con
ference. Coach Twiggs is counting
on McCann to form the nucleus of
a championship team this year.
Rosberg, Schuler on Team
Another golfer who should give
| able service to the Indians this year
is Bob Rosberg. Rosberg was twice
runner-up in the California state
! championships, and, before that,
winner of the junior championship
| of California.
Jack Schuler is another proven
| golfer who will aid Stanford in gain
ing fairway supremacy. Schuler is
, a Portlander who won the "City of
i Roses" championship last summer.
He completes the triumvirate of ex
| perienced golfers on whom coach
J Twiggs is counting to cop the coast
! cfown in 1946.
Six More Round Out Squad
This is by no means all. There are
{ six more golfers to round out the
! coach Twiggs' team. Unfortunately

i there is little information on them
as yet, but all should contribute to
J a well-rounded Cardinal team.
The others on the team are Tom
: Lambie, Bob Cardinal, Jim Priest,
' Gordon Dotzer (a transfer from
j Yale), Pete Brown, and Don Jones.
' Coach Twiggs is well satisfied with
j all of these men, and they should
provide many a headache to any
j aspiring golf team that hopes to
J take the conference crown this
I spring.
Many Veterans
Almost the entire team is newly
discharged from the armed forces,
most of it from the air corps, and it
[ should be the surprise team of the
i season. Eddie Twiggs has consist-
I ently turned out championship teams
' which have walked all over any Pa
j cific Coast competition, and usually
I gone on to take the national cham
pionship. Stanford supporters can
hardly expect to see a team that
compares to those immediately pre
ceding the war, but it will be one to
which they can point with pride.
After their disastrous experiences
with Indian teams in the past, op
posing coaches will look to Eddie
Twiggs' 1946 team for some of the
toughest competition on the coast,
