## SIDELINE SLANTS By JIM WELTER

Last week Art Levinson, Daily Sports Editor, stuck out his
beautiful little neck and declared that despite all their visual bal
lyhoo, University of California at Los Angeles has really never
put out good athletic teams. Poor misguided Mr. Levinson went
on furlher to state that all indications pointed to a Cardinal vic
tory in the ensuing basketball series with the Southerns. The
Uclans migrated northward minus their first string center —re-
tained in the custody of the medicos—and Arnold, their stellar
guard and playmaker. Navy transfers had cost Coach Johns the
latter of these two cagers.
| JOHNS DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY
Well, by now all Farmhands are well aware of some false
hood in Art's reasoning for the Bruins seldom were in trouble as
they mauled the local lads twice. Only once, late in the first
half of the second game, did Johns have cause for excess worry.
That time occurred as Bill Christianson led the rally that pulled
j the Deanmen from a ten-point deficit to the 21-20 half time count.
The moral of the story is that if UCLA is as far below par as
Mr. Levinson and other scribes claim, Stanford would now be
in a high school league level. On second thought, that assump
tion might be justified since Fordy Anderson's "B" team fell to
Palo Alto High in one of the prelims.
All in all, Coach Dean's aggregation is not as bad as it looked
this last weekend. It is the unhidden truth that the team is poor
(3an Francisco papers employ a word "hapless" in the same sen
tence as "Stanford basketball team" but the use of such an
adjective disdains me —it's too much like "helpless"). It is also
true that no quintet representing a campus with a population
numbering 440 C is so lacking in ability that they can muster but
eighteen points during a whole game and at the same time go
through nineteen and a half minutes without sinking one field
goal.
CARDS WERE COLD
Friday night's trouble was the same as befalls any team. It
was one of those nights when everything they try, 110 matter
how spiritedly, for some unexplainable reason ends up wrong.
1 Since Stanford is a poor team, slipping to the bottom meant really
hitting the depths.
Saturday was too soon after the Friday debacle for a recovery
sufficient to bring victory. Even though defeated in this fray, the
boys did put on a show that could be called basketball playing
There is one sweet note, however. Everyone will agree that
the players did try, a direct contrast to the rooting section's
efforts. Cheering results were even more pitiful than the team
playing results, but the sad part is that the team was trying. Men
like Christianson, Murphy, Hill, Rodman, Martin, Merideth, and
I O'Brian did not give up. The noise and enthusiasm of the Friday
night crowd would have been put to shame had it been alongside
a Heidelberg rooting section. (Yours truly realizes that the read
ers probably have never heard of that college but it is analagous
to the cheering heard from Stanfordites.
By Saturday the supporters section had depreciated noticeably
and the spirit they managed to emit was dismal compared with
that of the small, loyal band of UCLA followers. Cardinal cheer
leaders even failed to appear for the Saturday fray. (At a Cal
game a week ago, individual rooters of the local troupe started
i many of the Farm school songs that were sung.)
