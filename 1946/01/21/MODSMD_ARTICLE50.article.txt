## 
### 
Stanford's Junior Varsity basketball team proved too good for Menlo
Junior College's representatives last week-end, but fell before a younger
but better Palo Alto High School quintet.
Moving the ball around the floor nicely, Forrest "Fordy" Anderson's
(>!>silv ton lied the visitors from Menlo by a score of 4.'] to 32. The

Stanford team quickly assumed the"*
lead and never floundered during
the forty minutes.
Everything about the team looked ;
good. They left little doubt that
they could have run up a more con- ;
vincing margin of victory. Their j
passing, shooting, and strategy were j
fine. And Coach Anderson was j
happy. He had kind words for his |
boys, particularly Muir, who buck- i
eted 14 points to lead the Indian j
scoring parade. Other high scorers !
for the locals were Wood and Ha
gopian who dropped 7 and 10 points
respectively.
Only Meido r.ien -< worry the
locals were Necdham and Durnell,
who made 15 and 13 points. But
they let almost as many through
to counteract much of this good
ofTensive wovi'
But on Saturday it was a different j
story. The red-clad team seemed
never to get started. Poor passing
and sloppy court work muffled |
many potential two-pointers. Many
men were left unnoticed under the ,
bucket.
Palo Alto Ilisjh. aggressive and
smooth-working, just went to the
front and stayed there. High
school regulations (eight-minute
quarters) held the score down.
