# Pre-Luisetti Cage Teams Were Weak
## 
### 
With Hank "Deadeye" Luisetti
only a freshman star, the Stanford j
1935 cage team staggered to another
unsuccessful season. Though they j
won a few contests, they once again
hit the bottom rung of the ladder.
The league was powerful once again \
but it all seemed to be harnessed on
the iJ.S.C. and Cal basketball quin
tets.
Barnstorming Trip a Drizzle
To start things off wrong, the In- 1
dians began their annual barn
storming trip. They didn't storm !
much but presented only a slight j
drizzle. Either because they had too
much turkey on Thanksgiving or
were hampered by the horrible
Eastern climate (plug for Chamber
of Commerce), the Indians were
bothered by sickness that prevented
them from being in top form. They
did manage to cop three scalps while
losing six contests to strong oppo
nents, or so the paper said.
Once again Keith "Vow Boy"
Topping, fresh from the Rose Bowl,
joined the team to begin his third
year at the pivot spot.
At the two forward slots were
Arne Anderson and Howell Turner,
both with elongated frames. At one
guard position was A 1 Page, fast and
scrappy team member, while Bryan
"Dinty" Moore, smooth floor man,
played the other guard.

The Stanford boys started the
season off in grand style by losing
to the Trojans from down south.
After being beaten 40-30, the In
dians did come back though and to
everybody's surprise lost the second
only by two digits, 40-38. Moore
and Turner led the boys in their
valiant attempt.
Next came the Bears, who won
handily 45 to 31. We won't make
any more comment on this game.
With Topping sidelined the Bruins
took the Indians into camp 34-27
and 38-32. Unfortunately the Car
dinals hit the cellar by reason of
these defeats. With the Indians
playing desultory ball some guy
named Ball (who really was on it)
scored 26 markers for the opposi
tion.
Not having won a game in the
Pavilion since 1925. the Stanford
j quintet tried once again to break
this Bear jinx but lost 37-31. They
were even leading the powerful
Bears but it didn't last.
Topping Leads Indians
Trojans again came to the Farm
Ito show their skill and they did
with ease. These scores were 55-40.
33-29. The injured Topping did
' manage to sink 16 markers in the
iwin defeat.
The Bears were next but this time
the Indians upset the apple cart by
tripping the Bears in a roughie on
the local court, 38-34. It marked
the third time that the Bears had
met defeat in the Pavilion. The In
dians were really colling now. They
proceeded to whip U.C.L.A. twice,
33-28 and 35-16, and throw the
conference race in a three-way tie
for second.
It was all in vain, though, because
j the Indians still had to face the
Bears. It was a good game but the
Bears won, 50-43. Even though it
: was a disastrous seasbn, Dinty
' Moore made all-conference guard
i though only a sophomore, and
! gleaned a little glory for the Car

unsuccessful season. Though they j
won a few contests, they once again
hit the bottom rung of the ladder.
The league was powerful once again \
but it all seemed to be harnessed on
the iJ.S.C. and Cal basketball quin
tets.
Barnstorming Trip a Drizzle
To start things off wrong, the In- 1
dians began their annual barn
storming trip. They didn't storm !
much but presented only a slight j
drizzle. Either because they had too
much turkey on Thanksgiving or
were hampered by the horrible
Eastern climate (plug for Chamber
of Commerce), the Indians were
bothered by sickness that prevented
them from being in top form. They
did manage to cop three scalps while
losing six contests to strong oppo
nents, or so the paper said.
Once again Keith "Vow Boy"
Topping, fresh from the Rose Bowl,
joined the team to begin his third
year at the pivot spot.
At the two forward slots were
Arne Anderson and Howell Turner,
both with elongated frames. At one
guard position was A 1 Page, fast and
scrappy team member, while Bryan
"Dinty" Moore, smooth floor man,
played the other guard.
Cards Drop First Troy Series
The Stanford boys started the
season off in grand style by losing
to the Trojans from down south.
After being beaten 40-30, the In
dians did come back though and to
everybody's surprise lost the second
only by two digits, 40-38. Moore
and Turner led the boys in their
valiant attempt.
Next came the Bears, who won
handily 45 to 31. We won't make
any more comment on this game.
With Topping sidelined the Bruins
took the Indians into camp 34-27
and 38-32. Unfortunately the Car
dinals hit the cellar by reason of
these defeats. With the Indians
playing desultory ball some guy
named Ball (who really was on it)
scored 26 markers for the opposi
tion.
Not having won a game in the
Pavilion since 1925. the Stanford
j quintet tried once again to break
this Bear jinx but lost 37-31. They
were even leading the powerful
Bears but it didn't last.
Topping Leads Indians
Trojans again came to the Farm
Ito show their skill and they did
with ease. These scores were 55-40.
33-29. The injured Topping did
' manage to sink 16 markers in the
iwin defeat.
The Bears were next but this time
the Indians upset the apple cart by
tripping the Bears in a roughie on
the local court, 38-34. It marked
the third time that the Bears had
met defeat in the Pavilion. The In
dians were really colling now. They
proceeded to whip U.C.L.A. twice,
33-28 and 35-16, and throw the
conference race in a three-way tie
for second.
It was all in vain, though, because
j the Indians still had to face the
Bears. It was a good game but the
Bears won, 50-43. Even though it
: was a disastrous seasbn, Dinty
' Moore made all-conference guard
i though only a sophomore, and
! gleaned a little glory for the Car
| dinal. —Pascoe
With Hank "Deadeye" Luisetti
only a freshman star, the Stanford j
1935 cage team staggered to another
unsuccessful season. Though they j
won a few contests, they once again
