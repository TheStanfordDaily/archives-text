# Communists Blamed For G.I. Outbreaks

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (UP).â€”
Ernie Adamson, counsel for the
House Committee on Unamerican
Activities which has been quietly in
vestigating G. I. demonstrations
against the demobilization slow
down, said tonight that evidence in
dicates Communists "agitated some
of the soldiers."
"We have evidence to show that
Communist agitators actually went
into the Army for the sole purpose
of causing trouble," he declared. He
said in this regard that the com
mittee is particularly interested in
the Frankfurt, Germany, demonstra
tion.
He disclosed that the committee
is working with Army intelligence
and plans to hold public hearings
at which War Department repre
sentatives and some of the pro
testing G. I.'s will have a chance
to be heard.
He said that preliminary results
of the inquiry convince him that
some of the mass demonstrations
were the result of a "well-laid Com
munist plot to stir up the soldiers."
He added that a New York City or
ganization, which he described as
closely identified with the Commu
nist party, will be ordered to send
representatives to the hearing.
"This organization printed a lot
of hand-outs designed to upset our
home-sick soldiers in Europe and
the Far East," Adamson said.
"These pamphlets were extremely
critical of our foreign policy and
implied that the soldiers are being

kept overseas solely for political
reasons."
He said that such charges natural
ly made the G. I.'s feel that their
homecoming was a long way off.
Adamson noted that the Army
recently made some arrests in
connection with the demonstra
tions and said:
"If the Army decides to court
martial any of these men for incit
ing to mutiny, we'll keep our hands
off. We don't want to interfere in
the operation of the military estab
lishment in any way. But we may
ask the War Department to let us
question them after the courts-mar
tial have been concluded."
