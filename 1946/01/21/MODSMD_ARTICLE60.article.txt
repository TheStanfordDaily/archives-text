# Steel Strike Starts; Union's History Told
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Monday, Jan. 21
(UP).—A general strike of 750,000
.steel and aluminum workers began
;it 12:01 a.m. today as the CIO Uni
ted Steel Workers aimed a knock
out blow in its fight for a cost-of
living wage increase.
It was the greatest single walk
out in American history, and the
great mills which form the eco
nomic backbone of the nation
were shut down tight.
Philip Murray, president of the
steel union and the CIO, returned
from Washington to take personal
charge of the strike he called to win
a wage; increase of $1.48 a day after
negotiations with U.S. Steel Corpo
ration failed in Washington.
As the strike deadline arrived
tempers of the steelworkers became
tauht. Orders were given to march
on the mills.
Thousands of shivering pickets
from coast to coast gathered at the
gates of the plants which had de
nied them a wage increase until the
prices of their products were raised.
Steel union headquarters an
nounced the strike call would af
fect more than 1,200 plants in 30
states. Only a few unorganized
mills and a number of others
whose contracts did not call for
reopening of the wage clause
were not affected.
Words and statistics, conferences
over glass-topped tables, had failed.
The union resorted to the psycho
logical and economic impact of a
general strike.
By sundown yesterday all but a
few of the nation's mills were down
cold. Smoke ceased to rise from the
stacks. Bessemer converters no
longer cast their reddish glow into
the skies; the last heat had been
poured, the last ingot cast, the last
sheet rolled.
Throughout the country, union
members heard their leaders at mass
meetings urge them to hold out on
the picket lines until their wage in
crease is won. Strike chairmen spe
cifically charged the men to ab
stain from violence.
Then with the words, "Head for
the picket lines, men!" the strike
was on. Through swirling snow in
Pittsburgh the workers marched on
the plant gates.
