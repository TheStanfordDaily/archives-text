PITTSBURGH, Jan. 20 (UP).—
The story of the steel strike, great
est in American history, is the
story of the rise to power of or
ganized labor in the steel indus
try.
Violence, lockouts and bitter
strikes marked the birth of the steel
union which today claims at least
900.000 members in a well - knit,
well-disciplined organization.
The CIO United Steelworkers is
a baby union, less than 10 years old,
and the general strike called for one
minute after midnight is one of its
greatest Vests.
Under the leadership of I'hilip
Murray, who also heads the CIO,
the USW succeeded in blanket
organizing the industry where
other unions had failed in almost
50 years of strife - marked at
tempts.
Now the union plans to use the
economic and psychological impact
of the strike to gain an increase of
$1.48 per day, after words, statis
tics and conferences over glass
topped tables failed.
Although the current strike was
expected to be peaceful, bitterness
and bloodshed have been common
to steel strikes of the past. On May
30, 1937, 18 persons were killed in
the "Little Steel strike" at Republic
Steel Corporation in Chicago. Eight
een were killed in the '"Homestead
massacre" of July 6, 1892, when
Carnegie, Company tried to
bring in 300 Pinkcrton guards dur
ing a strike at its Homestead, Pa.,
mills. And on Jan. 7, 1916, two per
sons were killed, scores injured, and
10 city blocks razed when gunplay
broke out during a strike at Youngs
town, Ohio.
Until 1937, labor in the steel in
dustry was weak. The Amalga
mated Association of Iron. Steel,
and Tin Plate Workers had made
little progress in five major or
ganizing attempts carried out
from 1901 to 1933.
The AFL began an organizing
drive in 1918 that led to the steel
strike of 1919, involving 360,000
steelworkers. That had been the
largest strike in the industry to date.
Then in 1936, the association
turned to the Steelworkers' Or
ganizing Committee of the CIO.
The SWOC was headed by Philip
Murray, who won an industry
shaking victory in 1937 when U.S.
Steel Corporation signed is first
union contract covering steel
workers.
Bethlehem. Republic, Youngstown
Sheet and Tube, and Inland Steel
opposed the union, however, and in
1537, the "Little Steel strike" took
place. The union lost, but four
years later won collective bargain
ing elections at all four companies.
Today there are only two major
producers who are not under USW
contracts — Weirton Steel Company
and American Rolling Mills Com
pany.
