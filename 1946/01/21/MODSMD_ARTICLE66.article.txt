# Truman Gives State-of-Union Message Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 20 (UP).â€”
Congressional leaders, beset by pleas
for strike-preventing legislation,
tonight awaited President Tru
man's combined state of the union
and budget message before going
ahead with top-priority labor bills
and other reconversion measures.
Mr. Truman will send his mes
sage to the House and Senate at
noon tomorrow. It is expected
that he once again will ask Con
gress to speed action on the re
mainder of his 21-point reconver
sion program which he recently
charged had been delayed un
necessarily.
Members also are anxious to see
how close Mr. Truman will come to
balancing the budget. Most do not
expect an outright balance but they
believe the President's recommen
dations will come close to it.
Action on the presidential request
for legislation setting up fact-find
ing boards in labor disputes will
come Tuesday when the House la
bor committee vot,es on the admin
istration bill. Committee members
said the vote would be close but.
declined to predict the outcome.
Acting Chairman Jennings Ran
dolph, D., W. Va., said he was cer
tain the committee would act Tues
day.
Meanwhile, the Senate will con
tinue tied* lip in a filibuster that
has hlockd any attempt at action
on legislation. Begun by south
ern Democrats Thursday when a
bill to create a permanent fair
employment practices committee
was brought to the floor, it has
aroused Republicans and liberal
Democrats.
