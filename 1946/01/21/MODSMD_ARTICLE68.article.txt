"Time Bomb." by E. A. Pillcr; i
Arco Publishing Company, $2.00,
1945.
In polite society fascism is not a
fit topic of conversation. If you are
so tactless as ,to bring it up you are
eyed with bored indifference or sus
picion: "Aha, another Red." Or,
anyway, a parlor pink.
This is a pity. For if fascism were
to become dominant in America,
polite society would not be excepted
from suffering. It wasn't in Italy
and it wasn't in Germany.
Crackpots!
''OK." you say, "but look bore,
this isn't a real problem for us:
there arc just a few crackpots
here and there; they don't amount
to anything. We've always bad a
few Gerald L. K. Smiths who go
around and make stupid speeches
to which no one pays any atten
tion."
No one? Just a few crackpots?
Without wishing to be alarming,
I would like to say that "Time
Bomb" shows the opposite. And it
doesn't do it by abstract theorizing,
but by blunt facts, facts that arc
irrefutable.
It Can't Happen Here
Some years ago "Under Cover"
brought to light the activities of
home-grown fascists. This was fol
lowed by "Sabotage." Filler's
"Time Bomb" is the latest in the
scries and takes you through the
recent developments.
When you read of the innumer
able organizations and men. of
their large mailing lists and im
mense financial backing, when
you read of these groups and
have their names, addresses, and
statements, you are no longer so
sure that "it can't happen here."
"Christian American"
You realize that while these
groups do not strongly co-operate
with each other the danger may
not be too great. But you hate to
think what might happen if they
all joined in a united front.
Some of the names, like Gerald L.
K. Smith's and Father Coughlin's,
are familiar. Most, of them are not.
Few of us have heard much about
"The Christian American," an
amazingly powerful organization in
the South. Backed by such men as
Texas' Senator O'Daniel and Val
entine Ulrey, wealthy realtor, it has
already pushed antUlabor laws
through 11 Southern legislatures, is
now working on others.
Ulrey—los per Cent American
Chairman Ulrey, advocate of a
12-hour day, once wrote for Win
rod (who is indicted for alleged
conspiracy with the Nazis to over
throw our government):
"Into this bedlam and chaos in
Germany Adolf Hitler injected
himself as a new . . . mcssiah, to
lead the orderly German from
political confusion to systematic
unity."
The anti - Negro, anti - Catholic,
ant i-labor "Christian American" is
efficiently organized, and highly ef
fective in Southern politics. It can
not be ignored as a crackpot out
fit.
North and Mid-West
It is aided by the "Commoner
Party," by the far from dead Klan,
by the activities of "Bob" Reynolds,
former Senator from South Caro
lina. and by others.
The South is not alone. As you
move North, the anti-Catholic
doctrines vanish, but others stay
the same. Dozens of organizations
arc active in the East and IV!id -
West, centralized around Chicago
and Detroit.

And the West
Names? Kamp, Oil ling, Winrod,
Father Curran, McWilliams, Good
win, Ackley, de Tarnowsky, Rob
nett, Baerman, Mrs. Holman. . . .
Names ol ruthless men and women
who scorn no lie, no fraud to gain
their ends.
The West, though perhaps least
affected, is not free of these ele
j ments.
Piller deserves credit for using a
I fairly concrete definition of fascism.
He avoids indiscriminate smearing
and the labeling of reactionary
I groups, such as the Hearst papers,
las fascist. He takes his definition
i from a War Department statement
i which reads in part:
Fascism Defined
"Fascism is government by the
few and for the few. The objective
is seizure and control of the eco
nomic, political, social and cultural
life of the state."
"If we don't understand fas
cism when we see it.it might crop
up again—under another label—
and cause another war."
Their Traits
The spreading of religious and
race hatred, of anti-British, anti-
Russian, anti-United Nations propa
ganda, and the indiscriminate pin
ning of the label "Communist" on
any opposition, are, according to
the War Department, among the
practices and attitudes all fascists
have in common.
"Every person who has one of
them is not necessarily a fascist.
But he is in a mental state that
i lends itself to the acceptance of
I fascist aims."
1 Target: the Veteran
I The veteran is one of the imme
diate targets. By making him dis
satisfied with his lot and filling his
head with fantastic promises, the
demagogues hope to enlist his sup
port. They know how easily Hitler
j turned the bitter, disillusioned vet
| eran into a ruthless storm-trooper,
and they hope for a repeat per
formance.
"Most of us," says Piller, "want
to feel safe in our country, and
wanting to feel safe, prefer to build
a wall of blindness around our own
intelligence and tell ourselves that
'one incident does not make a
trend.'
"Time Bomb" by its calm, factual
reporting makes the problem real
to the reader. To solve it, Pillcr
believes we must work together
now, for .
"Fascism is not a force which is
going to be stamped out simply by
the revelation of its existence. We
have been witness to the fact that if
it is allowed to grow, the force nec
essary to defeat it may have to be
huge and almost overwhelming.
Not Relaxing
"Time Bomb" is not entertaining.
I It is not relaxing. It isn't meant to
be. If you are looking merely for
entertainment stay away from it. If.
however, "liberty" and "democracy"
are more than empty words to you,
the information you will find in
"Time Bomb" will be of interest and
importance to you.—George Brunn
