. Significantly related to the feeling a student has toward his
school is the manner of observance of certain traditions which
have developed throughout the years because they have con
tributed constructively toward the student's habits of thought
or attitude toward the school itself.
During the war a number of traditions peculiar to Stanford
were neglected, either through necessity, or lack of interest, but
even so there was always a group on campus that concerned
itself with the perpetuation of those traditions which have proved
of value to the "Stanford Family."
Today, as the University returns to its rightful job of educat
ing men and women for peace, that group is growing in number,
and with its growth has come a new effort to inform newcomers
about Farm traditions, an effort made especially difficult because
of the present class and group disorganization. This week,
therefore, the Daily in a series of articles will attempt to outline
those traditions, major and minor, which have been respected in
the past. We realize, however, that no university in a nation
that has been through World War II could expect to remain un
changed; in fact, the war has undoubtedly given some Stanford
members a newer, more serious sense of values. Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur has said that personally he has never been
particularly interested in traditions unless they had a constructive
side and were able to survive under strain or adversity.
"Just to do things the way they have been done never has
interested me, nor has it interested the very high percentage
of those who come to Stanford. But when good ways to do things
have been discovered and fit appropriately into the life of Stan
ford, then a defense of them so that they may be given con
tinuous trial throughout the years has always seemed to me to
be in order."
The traditions represented in this v/eek's issue are those
which seem to "fit appropriately" into postwar Stanford life—
the traditions which, we feel, are an answer to the general theme
of alumni in the service or students already returned to the
campus whose letters say "We want the same old Stanford."
