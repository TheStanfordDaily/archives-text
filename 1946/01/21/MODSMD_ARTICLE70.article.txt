# Colonel Garrecht: Manila Bombardment To Stanford's Postwar R.O.T.C. Unit
## 
### GEORGE BRUNN 
In the lower brackets of the army
you are likely to get two views of
colonels, both of them prejudicod.
You may think of him as the yuy
responsible for most of your troub
les. You come under his critical
surveillance during full field inspec
tions when he notices that the
toothbrush is an eighth of an inch
from where it should be. You dis
like him thoroughly.
Or, if you are a little naive, you
might get the Hollywood view: the
colonel is the man whose daughter
the buck private marries, the man
with the stern exterior and the soft
heart.
No Stereotype
When you meet a man with ea
gles on his shoulders privately
you are therefore a little sur
prised to find him quite like other
human beings. Col. Francis A.
Garrecht, in charge of the return
ing Army R.O.T.C. unit, jolts your
basic training and Hollywood the
ories. He doesn't fit into the
(he niches you cut out for him.
lie seems, above all, normal. In
spite of his 22 years as a regular
army officer and his West Point
training—he received his commis
sion in the field artillery from the
Point in 1923—there is nothing mili
taristic about him.
Old Farm Man
He has been through a vast num
ber of camps and schools. His ex
perience and training make him
eminently qualified to head tan
ford's R.O.T.C. program: He has
been associated with the Oregon
State College R.0.T.C., and knows
the Farm well from his stay here

in 1940 when he was assistant pro
fessor of military science and tac
tics, coach of the polo team, and in
charge of the animal transport de
partment.
Long service with the artillery
makes Col. Garrecht particularly
suitable for the Farm R.0.T.C.,
whose largest section has tradi
tionally been—and will continue
to he—field artillery. The pro
gram also offers reserve commis
sions in the Quartermaster Corps,
and, for engineering students, in
ordnance.
Sam Houston to Japan
With his new gold bars the colo
nel went from West Point to Fort
Sam Houston in 1923. This was fol
lowed by service in the Philippines,
Fort Sill, Oregon State College,
Fort Myer, Stanford, Leavenworth,
where he attended the Command
and General Staff School, and Fort
Sill again, as instructor in tactics
and Director of the Tactics Depart-*
ment of the Officers' Candidate
School.
In April 1943 he joined the newly
formed 69th Division as division
artillery executive. After going
through the Army and Navy Staff
College, he served for six months on
Admiral Barbey's staff in Now
Guinea. Admiral Barbcy command
ed the Seventh Amphibious Force
in the Southwest Pacific.
The Walled City
Col. Garrccht then joined the
Hth Corps at Lingayen as Assist
ant Artillery Officer and -stayed
with it until the Corps landed at
Sengai, Japan. He helped to plan
] and execute the famous bomhard-
I ment of the Walled Citv of Ma
nila, a bombardment that featured
1 some highly effective, if unortho
dox, artillery fire.
Like most veterans the colonel is
reticent about his war experiences
and happy to be back in the States.
Temporary Schedule
Hhe returned to Stanford on De
' cember 3, and is now engaged in
setting up the R.O.T.C. program
here. It, like so many other Farm
activities, has been a temporary
wartime casualty, and must be com
pletely re-established.
For the time being the pro
gram operates on an interim
schedule, until permanent plans
can be worked out. As yet there
| is no division into field artillery,
j ordnance, and quartermaster sec
! tions, according to Col. Garrccht.
j Instructors
The advanced group is now taking
I courses common to all three
branches. Besides Col. Garrccht,
Major Eric E. Duckstad and Captain
Jack C. Eisenschmidt, both for
merly associated with the AST pro
j gram on campus, are on the R. 0.-

112 T.C. instructing staff.
Before the war about 400 stu
! dents belonged to the R.O.T.C. unit,
i The colonel pointed out that it will
| be some time before full strength
can be obtained. Immediately after
a war interest in military matters
is usually quite low. At the mo
ment there arc 20 students partici
pating, five of them veterans.
Veterans' Opportunities
tSudcnts completing the pro
gram receive a commission in the
organi/.cd reserves. The basic part
covers two years during which
students train three hours a week
for a unit of University credit.
The advanced part, for which all
veterans with a year or more of
military service are eligible, also
lasts two years and involves five
I hours of work weekly for three
j units of credit.
Under Col. Garrecht's leadership
the Army R.O.T.C. should soon be
once again an integral part of cam
pus life.

lie seems, above all, normal. In
spite of his 22 years as a regular
army officer and his West Point
training—he received his commis
sion in the field artillery from the
Point in 1923—there is nothing mili
taristic about him.
Old Farm Man
He has been through a vast num
ber of camps and schools. His ex
perience and training make him
eminently qualified to head tan
ford's R.O.T.C. program: He has
been associated with the Oregon
State College R.0.T.C., and knows
the Farm well from his stay here

in 1940 when he was assistant pro
fessor of military science and tac
tics, coach of the polo team, and in
charge of the animal transport de
partment.
Long service with the artillery
makes Col. Garrecht particularly
suitable for the Farm R.0.T.C.,
whose largest section has tradi
tionally been—and will continue
to he—field artillery. The pro
gram also offers reserve commis
sions in the Quartermaster Corps,
and, for engineering students, in
ordnance.
Sam Houston to Japan
With his new gold bars the colo
nel went from West Point to Fort
Sam Houston in 1923. This was fol
lowed by service in the Philippines,
Fort Sill, Oregon State College,
Fort Myer, Stanford, Leavenworth,
where he attended the Command
and General Staff School, and Fort
Sill again, as instructor in tactics
and Director of the Tactics Depart-*
ment of the Officers' Candidate
School.
In April 1943 he joined the newly
formed 69th Division as division
artillery executive. After going
through the Army and Navy Staff
College, he served for six months on
Admiral Barbey's staff in Now
Guinea. Admiral Barbcy command
ed the Seventh Amphibious Force
in the Southwest Pacific.
The Walled City
Col. Garrccht then joined the
Hth Corps at Lingayen as Assist
ant Artillery Officer and -stayed
with it until the Corps landed at
Sengai, Japan. He helped to plan
] and execute the famous bomhard-
I ment of the Walled Citv of Ma
nila, a bombardment that featured
1 some highly effective, if unortho
dox, artillery fire.
Like most veterans the colonel is
reticent about his war experiences
and happy to be back in the States.
Temporary Schedule
Hhe returned to Stanford on De
' cember 3, and is now engaged in
setting up the R.O.T.C. program
here. It, like so many other Farm
activities, has been a temporary
wartime casualty, and must be com
pletely re-established.
For the time being the pro
gram operates on an interim
schedule, until permanent plans
can be worked out. As yet there
| is no division into field artillery,
j ordnance, and quartermaster sec
! tions, according to Col. Garrccht.
j Instructors
The advanced group is now taking
I courses common to all three
branches. Besides Col. Garrccht,
Major Eric E. Duckstad and Captain
Jack C. Eisenschmidt, both for

lie seems, above all, normal. In
spite of his 22 years as a regular
army officer and his West Point
training—he received his commis
sion in the field artillery from the
Point in 1923—there is nothing mili
taristic about him.
Old Farm Man
He has been through a vast num
ber of camps and schools. His ex
perience and training make him
eminently qualified to head tan
ford's R.O.T.C. program: He has
been associated with the Oregon
State College R.0.T.C., and knows
the Farm well from his stay here

in 1940 when he was assistant pro
fessor of military science and tac
tics, coach of the polo team, and in
charge of the animal transport de
partment.
Long service with the artillery
makes Col. Garrecht particularly
suitable for the Farm R.0.T.C.,
whose largest section has tradi
tionally been—and will continue
to he—field artillery. The pro
gram also offers reserve commis
sions in the Quartermaster Corps,
and, for engineering students, in
ordnance.
Sam Houston to Japan
With his new gold bars the colo
nel went from West Point to Fort
Sam Houston in 1923. This was fol
lowed by service in the Philippines,
Fort Sill, Oregon State College,
Fort Myer, Stanford, Leavenworth,
where he attended the Command
and General Staff School, and Fort
Sill again, as instructor in tactics
and Director of the Tactics Depart-*
ment of the Officers' Candidate
School.
In April 1943 he joined the newly
formed 69th Division as division
artillery executive. After going
through the Army and Navy Staff
College, he served for six months on
Admiral Barbey's staff in Now
Guinea. Admiral Barbcy command
ed the Seventh Amphibious Force
in the Southwest Pacific.
The Walled City
Col. Garrccht then joined the
Hth Corps at Lingayen as Assist
ant Artillery Officer and -stayed
with it until the Corps landed at
Sengai, Japan. He helped to plan
] and execute the famous bomhard-
I ment of the Walled Citv of Ma
nila, a bombardment that featured
1 some highly effective, if unortho
dox, artillery fire.
Like most veterans the colonel is
reticent about his war experiences
and happy to be back in the States.
Temporary Schedule
Hhe returned to Stanford on De
' cember 3, and is now engaged in
setting up the R.O.T.C. program
here. It, like so many other Farm
activities, has been a temporary
wartime casualty, and must be com
pletely re-established.
For the time being the pro
gram operates on an interim
schedule, until permanent plans
can be worked out. As yet there
| is no division into field artillery,
j ordnance, and quartermaster sec
! tions, according to Col. Garrccht.
j Instructors
The advanced group is now taking
I courses common to all three
branches. Besides Col. Garrccht,
Major Eric E. Duckstad and Captain
Jack C. Eisenschmidt, both for
merly associated with the AST pro
j gram on campus, are on the R. 0.-

112 T.C. instructing staff.
Before the war about 400 stu
! dents belonged to the R.O.T.C. unit,
i The colonel pointed out that it will
| be some time before full strength
can be obtained. Immediately after
a war interest in military matters
is usually quite low. At the mo
ment there arc 20 students partici
pating, five of them veterans.
Veterans' Opportunities
tSudcnts completing the pro
gram receive a commission in the
organi/.cd reserves. The basic part
covers two years during which
students train three hours a week
for a unit of University credit.
The advanced part, for which all
veterans with a year or more of
military service are eligible, also
lasts two years and involves five
I hours of work weekly for three
j units of credit.
Under Col. Garrecht's leadership
the Army R.O.T.C. should soon be
once again an integral part of cam
pus life.
In the lower brackets of the army
you are likely to get two views of
colonels, both of them prejudicod.
You may think of him as the yuy
responsible for most of your troub
les. You come under his critical
surveillance during full field inspec
tions when he notices that the
toothbrush is an eighth of an inch
from where it should be. You dis
like him thoroughly.
Or, if you are a little naive, you
might get the Hollywood view: the
colonel is the man whose daughter
the buck private marries, the man
with the stern exterior and the soft
heart.
No Stereotype
When you meet a man with ea
gles on his shoulders privately
you are therefore a little sur
prised to find him quite like other
