# Tradition Condemns 'Smokers'
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Mrs. Stanford once asked that
there should be no smoking on
Quad. Her request has been ob
served by three generations of
Stanford students. They have pre
served the tradition through an
earthquake and two world wars.
Now, however, both Inner and
Outer Quad are clotted with cigar
ette butts. It is significant that this
should occur when so many old
students are returning. All of them
know the tradition, for it has been
widely publicized from the earliest
days of the University.
Newcomers to Stanford may
plead ignorance. Freshmen may see
upper classmen smoking and follow
their example in all good faith.
Others know the tradition well, but
they do not realize that Outer Quad
is included.
In reality, only the outer steps arc
excepted. The moment a Stanford
man or woman comes under the
roof of Outer Quad, his cigarette
should be extinguished. No class
room is so inaccessible that students
cannot come to these steps for a
smoke between classes or cannot go
to one of the rooms where it is al
lowed.
In referring to the tradition of no
smoking on Quad, Dr. Ray Lyman
Wibur remarked, "In a way it is not
so significant as the other traditions,
but it is one of those things that, if
maintained, help to keep up the
Family morale."
