# Farm Goal In Clothing Drive Given
## 
### 
Today and tomorrow arc thp last
days for the collection of contribu
tions for the UNRRA Clothing
Drive. Stanford's goal is at least
one article of clothing from every
student.
Woodpecker Lodge will be open
to receive the boxes of garments all
day today and tomorrow, according
to Phyllis Sutherland, Farm chair
man for the drive. Student living
groups are asked to furnish their
own transportation to Woodpecker
Lodge.
Collection Data Listed
War Board representatives in ev
ery living group are responsible for
the collection of clothes from their
residents. No sorting of clothes will
be necessary. Garments should be
put in as large a box as can be ob
tained and taken to the collection
point.
The types of clothing needed are
as follows: coats, suits, trousers,
skirts, dresses, shirts, sweaters,
knitwear, underwear, pajamas,
night gowns, shoes (also galoshes,
overshoes, rubbers), blankets, bed
ding, piece goods, remnants, and
draperies.
To prevent slowing up the han
dling of the clothes, donors are
asked to attach firmly the belts to
ladies' suits and other garments,
and to tie pairs of shoes together.
Useful Clothing Needed
Used clothing for both winter and
summer wear is needed. Although
clothing need not be in perfect re
pair, it must be useful to the people
who will receive it.
Washable garments should be
washed before they are given to the
collection, but they need not be
ironed. Other garments should be
clean and sanitary, but need not be
dry-cleaned before being contrib
uted.
The following articles are not de
sired in the clothing drive: straw
hats, toys, feather beds, pillows,
mattresses, novelties, and household
furnishings.
Worldwide Distribution
Donated clothing will be shipped
through the United Nations Relief
and Rehabilitation Administration
to countries where the devastations
of war have dislocated civilian sup
ply and economy. Distribution will
be worldwide, to the Far East and
the Philippines as well as to the war
torn countries of Europe. Garments
will be distributed free and with
out discrimination of any kind.
Approximately 25,000,000 people
in the war-torn countries have re
ceived clothing donated by the
American people in the United Na
tions Clothing Collection of last
spring. But this is only a small per
centage of the destitute homelss
people who need aid from the
UNRRA. The national goal for this
drive is 100.000,000 garments, and in
addition, bedding and shoes.
