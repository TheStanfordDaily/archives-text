## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
"Mis. Donald B. Tresidder will be
at home to students, faculty mem
bers, and friends Tuesday afternoon
from 4 to 5:30, at 623 Mirada. Stan
ford University."
So read the notice which appeared
in yesterday's and Friday's Daily.
Many students returning to the
campus after several years' absence,
or coming here for the first time,
may not realize that the open
[ houses, small dinners, and teas
| given by Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder
! since their arrival here in 1943 have
I become as much a part of Stanford
life as the "Hello" and "No Smoking
| on Quad" traditions.
i Stanford Family Preserved
By fostering a spirit of friendli
-1 ness between students and their
j University President, by giving stu

dents and faculty members a chance
to moet Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder in
formally and at home, the open
houses did as much to preserve and
increase the spirit of a "Stanford
Family'' during the war, as any one
thing ever did before.
Also helping to promote this
spirit have been the impromptu
student serenades at Dr. Tresidder's
home during the past two years.
One night, following "Uncle Don's"
return from a trip East, over 1,000 |
students marched up the hill to the
j old Hoover home to give Dr. Tres
i idder a surprise welcome home.
Another time students trekked to
| the Tresidders' after a rally. When
| the sororities were abolished, Row
| women turned out en masse to
j serenade Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder.
The Tresidders invited the wom»n
in that night, and sang and chatted

with them until after 10.
Discusses Farm History
At such open houses and similar
gatherings, Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder
have entertained their student
guests with stories of Stanford and
its history, and Yoscmitc; Dr. Tres
idder has turned guide to conduct
students around the grounds of the
house, pointing out landmarks fa
miliar to Stanford students; and
with the students he has discussed
problems common to students along
with hopes and plans for the future
of Stanford.
Mrs. Tresidder has announced
that she will hold open house every
fourth Tuesday of each month, con
tinuing a practice which, although
begun as a gesture of courtesy and
friendliness to the "Stanford Fam
ily," has become firmly established
as a Farm tradition.

At such open houses and similar
gatherings, Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder
have entertained their student
guests with stories of Stanford and
its history, and Yoscmitc; Dr. Tres
idder has turned guide to conduct
students around the grounds of the
house, pointing out landmarks fa
miliar to Stanford students; and
with the students he has discussed
problems common to students along
with hopes and plans for the future
of Stanford.
Mrs. Tresidder has announced
that she will hold open house every
fourth Tuesday of each month, con
tinuing a practice which, although
begun as a gesture of courtesy and
friendliness to the "Stanford Fam
ily," has become firmly established
as a Farm tradition.
"Mis. Donald B. Tresidder will be
at home to students, faculty mem
bers, and friends Tuesday afternoon
from 4 to 5:30, at 623 Mirada. Stan
ford University."
So read the notice which appeared
in yesterday's and Friday's Daily.
Many students returning to the
campus after several years' absence,
or coming here for the first time,
may not realize that the open
[ houses, small dinners, and teas
| given by Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder
! since their arrival here in 1943 have
I become as much a part of Stanford
life as the "Hello" and "No Smoking
| on Quad" traditions.
i Stanford Family Preserved
By fostering a spirit of friendli
-1 ness between students and their
j University President, by giving stu

dents and faculty members a chance
to moet Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder in
formally and at home, the open
houses did as much to preserve and
increase the spirit of a "Stanford
Family'' during the war, as any one
thing ever did before.
Also helping to promote this
spirit have been the impromptu
student serenades at Dr. Tresidder's
home during the past two years.
One night, following "Uncle Don's"
return from a trip East, over 1,000 |
students marched up the hill to the
j old Hoover home to give Dr. Tres
i idder a surprise welcome home.
Another time students trekked to
| the Tresidders' after a rally. When
| the sororities were abolished, Row
| women turned out en masse to
j serenade Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder.
The Tresidders invited the wom»n
in that night, and sang and chatted

with them until after 10.
