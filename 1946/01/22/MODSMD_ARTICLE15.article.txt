up around the patio.

will be used for renewing the Wom

soon.

Women's Conference Advisory
Board will meet today at 4 p.m.
in the Women's Clubhouse. It is
important for al! members to
come, according to Patty Patten,
president.

Housing Committee, announced that
open houses for freshmen and trans
fers will be held from 2:30 to 5 p.m.
to give the girls an extra half-hour
in which to visit all the houses in
their group. Open houses will be
held Feb. 3 and Feb. 17.
Speakers will talk at Roblc and
the Klahoya Club before the next
open house to tell the girls the
purposes of them and the impor

was also suggested that some of
the girls start at the top of the
