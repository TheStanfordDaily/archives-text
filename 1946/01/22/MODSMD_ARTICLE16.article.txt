# Life Work, Vocom Talk
## 
### 
Telling her audience that women
are no longer barred from any pro
fession, but that the doors are not
always open wide ("probably the
most interesting way a door can
be"), Miss Edith R. Mirriclees, pro
fessor emeritus of English, gave a
general picture of the importance of
work throughout life at the Vocom
program in Cubberley Auditorium
night.
The speaker stressed that a
woman can go anywhere in the
business world if she has patience,
a sense of humor and is willing to
do more than any man on the same
job.
"Stay Interesting"
Miss Mirriclees gave an all-too
short talk, judging from her audi
ence reaction, and kept her eyes on
the clock. She laughed that "no
souls are saved after the first 20
minutes."
Married women, she explained,
also should stay interesting by
keeping occupied with something
outside the household. War-time
showed how they can make time
for other things by their response to
war work and Red Cross.
MLss Mirriclees commented that
now the greater part of a woman's
adult life falls after 45, proving the
necessity for keeping interesting to
those about her. If she were to give
a long title to her speech, the speak
er said that she would call it "How
to Enjoy Living and Keep on Enjoy
ing Living," with the emphasis on
the last part. So many women, she
said, are enduring living, not en
joying it.
Broad Background
Miss Mirriclees' advice to her au
dience was to gel a good, broad
background in college. Ordinarily
there aren't enough women who are
willing to exert, themselves to do
good work.
"No one in any job can afford to
slop using his brain," she empha
sized.
"There is one thing which no
human being can be without," she
said, "and that is to feel important.
The surest way to gratify this need
is to work," she concluded.
