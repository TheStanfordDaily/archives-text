### 
| Bids for Branner's Saturday Sur
! realism dance will be put on sale to
; the general campus tomorrow at 1
! p.m. in the A.S.S.U. office, accord
j ing to Cathy Morris, Branner vice
I president. Branner women have
| been given preference in buying
bids, but the remaining bids will be
sold for 50 cents.
Eyes will be pasted on drapes, ta
bles will be supported by human
like legs, and people will be garbed
in the best Dali delirium tradition
of lamp shades, picture frames, and
alarm clock springs, said Miss Mor
ris. She added, however, that sur
realistic costumes won't be a ne
cessity. "Come in bobby socks or
formats," she said, "anything goes."
Dancing will begin at 9:30 p.m.
and will last until 1 a.m. Bids are
being sold to 125 couples, Miss Mor
ris pointed out, because the hall
would be unable to accommodate
the entire aftergame crowd.
Refreshments—hotdogs and cof
fee—will be served in Branner's in-
I ner court.
Committee heads are:
June Hemcnway, decorations;
Jackie Miller, tickets; Mary Mollcn
dorf, patrons; Barbara Whitehouse,
food; Peggy O'Neill, tables; Peggy
Stern, serving, and Nancy Raybould,
music.
