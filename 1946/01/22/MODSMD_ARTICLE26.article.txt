# The 						L'il Injun Blushed...
## 
### 
And speaking of traditions, our favorite
theme for the week, we'd like to mention that
old and formerly-cherished tradition of sports
manship. We'd like to know what happened !
to it.
It was obvious at the Stanford-U.C.L.A. games
last weekend that the Farm's cheering section
had grown rusty on its manners. The most un
courteous practices of booing decisions of the
referee and cheering when a foul was called
on your opponents, were in evidence to an
exto.it lhat made even the L'il Injun blush.
The final blow to our illusion that we had ;
press tved the traditions especially reserved to j
intramurals came at the end of the game. No
more than a fourth of the student body present i
remained to sing the Stanford Hymn. The piti- ;
fully small group had to attempt to do justice
to the hymn while those persons so eager to
leave trampled through the stands, totally dis
regarding the fact that they were helping to
knock down a long-standing custom. We hope
that this attitude is not the result of a lack of
Farm spirit, but of a lack of education, which
can be remedied, concerning the ways in which
that spirit is expressed.
In high schools they have to award plaques
to encourage sportsmanship and observance of
tradition. We should be able to say that both
exist at Stanford, solely because we want it
that way, and work for it.—N.S.
