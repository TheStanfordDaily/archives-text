FRENCH POLITICAL FRONT
Fhe recent news from France shows that
General DeGaulle is a man who sticks to his
principles. He was a conservatively inclined
president of a government controlled by the
left, and he quit v/hen the inevitable schism be
tween him and his parliament developed.
His first mov6 was to line up his own MRP
party with the Socialists, to block the Commu
nists. But he reckoned without the political
sagacity of Maurice Thorez, head of the French
Communist party.
NATIONALIZATION
Thorez fought hard for nationalization of ba
sic industries. The socialists were for him, but
DeGaulle stuck by his principles and blocked
this step. Then Thorez said to the Socialists,
"Your best place is with us."
Strengthened by the new alignment, of So
cialists and Communists versus MRPs, he then
did a good turn for Moscow by cutting down the
size of the French army. That was too much
for DeGaulle, and he walked out.

THOREZ DEFEAT
But when DeGaulle quit, Thorez suffered a
defeat. He probably wanted to work his own
brand of politics behind DeGaulle's reputation
as a hero. Without him as a unifying force,
the French peasant population and the ever
present French nationalism might hamper him
and hurt him if he went too far.
Thorez will now have the chance to reorgan
ize France without the general, but if the re
organization fails, he will have nobody to shift
the blame to.
As for DeGaulle, it might have been wiser
for him to quit, and not come back without full
control. France is in a horrible economic con
dition. That is why the Communists might have
gotten such a vote. Yet stamping the "This is
nationalized now" label on industry doesn't
necessarily increase productivity.
If Thorez brings DeGaulle back at a compro
mise, it will be somewhat of a defeat for him.
If he gives DeGaulle full charge, it will be a
complete defeat. If he does nothing at all, he
will have to succeed in setting France's econ
omy to rights, or else, at the next election,
DeGaulle can oppose him and his failure on
party lines without it being said of him, "You
were implicated in the fiasco too, Monsieur le
General."

Thorez fought hard for nationalization of ba
sic industries. The socialists were for him, but
DeGaulle stuck by his principles and blocked
this step. Then Thorez said to the Socialists,
"Your best place is with us."
Strengthened by the new alignment, of So
cialists and Communists versus MRPs, he then
did a good turn for Moscow by cutting down the
size of the French army. That was too much
for DeGaulle, and he walked out.

THOREZ DEFEAT
But when DeGaulle quit, Thorez suffered a
defeat. He probably wanted to work his own
brand of politics behind DeGaulle's reputation
as a hero. Without him as a unifying force,
the French peasant population and the ever
present French nationalism might hamper him
and hurt him if he went too far.
Thorez will now have the chance to reorgan
ize France without the general, but if the re
organization fails, he will have nobody to shift
the blame to.
As for DeGaulle, it might have been wiser
for him to quit, and not come back without full
control. France is in a horrible economic con
dition. That is why the Communists might have
gotten such a vote. Yet stamping the "This is
nationalized now" label on industry doesn't
necessarily increase productivity.
If Thorez brings DeGaulle back at a compro
mise, it will be somewhat of a defeat for him.
If he gives DeGaulle full charge, it will be a
complete defeat. If he does nothing at all, he
will have to succeed in setting France's econ
omy to rights, or else, at the next election,
DeGaulle can oppose him and his failure on
party lines without it being said of him, "You
were implicated in the fiasco too, Monsieur le
General."
