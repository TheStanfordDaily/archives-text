### STANLEY WILSON 
First of the week mentions: Why doesn't
someone take off those Cal Bear signs on the
Boathouse? They've been there since New
Year's Eve. High time they're gone. Or has
that Stanford spirit degenerated too far? . . .
A Rally Com representative just dropped in
and asked me to send on the following to you
readers: It seems Rally Com spends a lot of
time making posters each week regarding a
forthcoming basketball game, only to have
them torn down a few moments after they are
posted. In the first place, Rally Com members
don't like the advertising to go unnoticed, and
secondly, it's a lot of work painting posters,
putting them up, and just a little discouraging
to see them torn down by some souvenir
hunter . . .
Interesting guip from Marchie Schwartz,
football mentor: "I have a feeling next year's
team is going to be awfully mean and awfully
angry!!" I wonder who the East will send to
Pasadena? . . . Glad to see that Interfraternity
Board is on the ball and getting things done.
All of which shows what a group of students
can do when they organize and have a plan. A
lot of credit should go to Bruce Jessup, former
ASSU prexy, who started the ball rolling. . . .
Another "glad to see" item is the tradition
campaign launched yesterday by my Daily
friends. Now will someone pick me up on Wil
son's corner? . . .
The clothing drive is officially on now so
how about some help? Surely you have a dirty
old cashmere, mink, or a pair of alligator shoes
you can contribute. But seriously, remember
the goal is one item per person . . .
The cartoon you see on this page isn't as
funny as it seems. There is a Stanford student
on campus who has been reported sleeping in
his car. Must be kind of tough studying by
the dash lights, though!!
