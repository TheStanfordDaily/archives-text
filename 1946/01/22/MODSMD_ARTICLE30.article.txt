# ON THE DISCS
## 
### GEORGE ECKSTEIN LARRY FRANKLEY 
"A Red Kiss on a Blue Letter"
and "We'll Be Together Again" is
a good commercial disc. It is Les
Brown's newest platter and for
that reason is' disappointing he
cause we have come to expect
much more from this up-and
coming hand. Les's leapsters are
Stan Kenton's biggest rivals as
the new hand for l!)4(i, and if they
would only cut some of the origi
nals which really show the hand
to advantage, then the public
would also realize this.
On both sides of this disc, Doris
Day demonstrates her wonderful
talent to make something out of
nothing, although "We'll Be To
gether Again" is one of the better
pop tunes of the day. Her relaxed
manner of phrasing is very similar
to the better vocalists such as Fran
ces Wayne, Mildred Bailey, and
Peggy Lee. Ted Nash's tenor is
given a number of solo spots on
both sides and ho proves that Brown
has one of the finest sidemon on the
swing scene. His tone is beautiful
except when he soars into the upper
/.upper register.
Decca Delivers
For once, the Decca Recording
Company has issued a record of
Louis Jordan's on which he doesn't
have to be both comedian and mu
sician. It is a coupling of "Buzz Me"
and "Don't Worry 'Bout That Mule"
with Louis doing some fine singing
on both sides.
The first side is just another
blues, hut then again it is good
blues. Jordan has the ability to
sing with a great feeling and
should do things like this more
often. lie also plays some of his
alto in a manner reminiscent of
his Chick Webb days. The rhythm
is good, and although it is not an
exciting side, it is good jazz.
The reverse is not up to par be
cause of the tune. We couldn't make
much sense out of it, but maybe
(hat was because they were re
building Hage's at the time we were
listening to it. Once again, Louis
plays and sings his way through in
a very capable fashion with his
rough tone coming out in both his
vocal and alto chores.
Tommy Dorsey Too Dated
Arise, all ye squares, and make
merry! Tommy Dorsey has re
leased another record! This time it's
the old favorite "Chicago," backed
up by "Never Too Late to Pray."
Although the arrangement of "Chi
cago" does not set afire the tune as
effectively as Mrs. O'Leary's cow
set afire the city, it still amounts to
better than average Dorsey and be
low average jazz. Charlie Shavers
plays a few bars of muted trumpet
the way he used to in the John Kir
by band, and it proves to be much
more effective than the wide open
blasting that he employs today.
There is also a nice solo by Buddy
DeFrnnco, clarinet winner in the
Downbeat poll.
Vocals are taken care of by Sy
Oliver, arranger of the tune, and
the Sentimentalists, and they do an
adequate if not oustanding job. The
side is marred by the appearance of
a horrible tenor sax fugue near the
end. The other side is a very pleas

| ant number entitled "Never Too
Late to Pray." Featuring Stuart !
Foster on the voeal, it is some of j
the best Foster we have heard, and I
jit half-way justifies his selection by
! the Downbeat poll as the favorite ■
; band songster of 1945. At least it !
1 makes up for the outrage he com
| mitted on "A Door Will Open."
Ilines Hides Himself
The A.R.A. Record Company
continues on its way to the "big
time" by recording fine jazz artists
along with the usual commercial
money-getters. Their latest offcr
: ing is Earl Hines' "Nonchalant
j Man" and "At the EI Grotto." The
j first side is highlighted by a fine
but uninspired tenor solo, and it
reaches the very depths of nausea
with the appearance of a person
(the word vocalist here would be
misleading) named Lord Essex.
Essex outdoes Carmen Lombardo
I in his vibrato and generally ruins |
j the side. The reverse is just an- j
other rifT tune with solos by tenor
and alto saxes, clarinet, vibes, and
' guitar. A peculiar aspect of both ■
the sides is the absence of any |
piano solo by the Earl himself, j
Nevertheless, Ilines' crew has
I good potentialities and may im- !
prove with further recording.
A Word to the Wise
Two albums of note have ap
j peared in the music stores of Palo
1 Alto. The first of these is Eddie
Condon's George Gershwin Jazz
Concert on the Decca label. Fea- j
turing such instrumentalists as Bob- i
by Hackett, Jess Stacey, Max Ka- '
minsky, Jack Teagarden. Edmund
Hall, and thrush Lee Wiley on vo
cals, it is a comforting assurance
that Decca is coming out of their ,
rut. The other is the Art Tatum
album on A.R.A. Tatum is as good !
if not better than usual, glorifying
such tunes as "Runnin' Wi!d," j
"Memories of You," and "Hallelu- '
lah."
