# Hopkins Cites Labor, Business Background
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
The dilemma facing both man
agement and labor in the present
industrial situation is similar to the
I "case of the immovable bachelor and
the irresistible blonde," according to
Dr. William S. Hopkins, professor
j of economics at Stanford.
j "The industrial situation is a com-
I plex business," Mr. Hopkins stated,
"and is perhaps the worst in the
history of the country in terms of
■ men involved."
In giving a background for the
present conflict between manage
ment and labor, Mr. Hopkins ex
plained lhat during the war both
I sides were in a "unique situation"
1 where a government agency—the
WLB- settled disputes arbitrarily.
WLB Conflict Told
"Neither side liked it," Mr. Hop
kins added, "but eventually they got
to the stage where they wouldn't
■ settle disputes themselves. It costs
| money to bargain collectively or to
| arbitrate. It didn't cost anything to
turn a dispute over to a board to be
settled."
A4r. Hopkins pointed out that as
the end of the war with Japan ap
proached, labor and management
were in the habit of depending on
j a board to settle disputes.
As a result, Mr. Hopkins ex
! plained, both sides were anxious to
■ work out some technique to settle
, disputes themselves. "Both sides
were scared," he added. "Labor was
'as scared as management. So they
looked to the White House for help,
but the White House didn't act."
White House Controlled WLB
Mr. Hopkins gave as evidence of
the feeling between labor and man
agement his experience as a public
member of the regional War Labor
j Board. He declared that members
! of the board spent days "wrangling
j on policy" and that they in turn re
flected the views of Washington with
: whom they were in constant contact.
In contrasting the speed with
which President Roosevelt worked
after Pearl Harbor with that ol
President Truman after the end of
J the war, Mr. Hopkins pointed out
! that Roosevelt had the WLB in op

to set up effective machinery to take
care of strikes.
"By September 5, when Truman
called a conference," Mr. Hopkins
said, "both sides had time to ma
neuver. - The conference came too
late. Labor and management had
licked themselves by their maneu
vering."
As a reason tor labor's actions Mr.
Hopkins gave figures on wages and
hours for Sept. 1944. He pointed out
that at that time four million wage
earners in the United States re
ceived less than 40 cents an hour.
Lowest Wages Listed
For a 40-hour week and a 50-
week year the total earnings for
those workers would amount to less
than $842 a year. "These figures in
clude the deep South and don't nec
essarily apply here," Mr. Hopkins
explained, "but they represent a
mean all over the country."
Mr. Hopkins added that about
one-fifth of the workers employed
in non - manufacturing industries
earned less than 50 cents an hour.
Their total yearly earnings amount
ed to less than SI .040.
In answer to the overtime argu
ment Mr. Hopkins stated the maxi
mum overtime would permit a 10-
hour day. Working for 50 cents on
a six-day week for 52 weeks the
worker could earn at the most $1,810
a year.
Strikes Agitated by Wives
"When the workers bring their
pay checks home and there isn't
enough money to pay for rent and
food, it's the wives who agitate for
the strikes—not the Communists,"
Mr. Hopkins declared.
He added that at the end of the
war the chance to work overtime
eration a month and a half after
December 7.
Conference Was Too Late
Mr. Hopkins asserted that the
President should have called a con
ference between labor and manage
was taken away, and the worker's
wages dropped down to $1,080 a
year. At the same time prices con
tinued to rise.
The increased productivity of la

bor and the increase in profits for
industry were other factors in la
bor's present position. Industrial
profits in 1945 over 1940 show a 250
per cent increase after taxes, Mr.
Hopkins stated.
He added, "Industry claims it
needs this extra capital to recon
vert, but according to figures from
the United States Department of
Treasury, industry needs only three
billion to reconvert. Industry has
on hand 22 billion right now. That
is the pictur# labor sees."
No Solution Now Apparent
In discussing a possible solution
for the present conflict, Mr. Hopkins
said, "There is no immediate solu
tion except to slug it out. There may
be solutions for future strikes.
Mr. Hopkins thought it would be
too difficult for the President to
take over the steei industry and
added, "Mr. Fairless would put up a
better fight than Sewell Avery."
He explained that the Leiserson
proposal for a large conciliation
service including permanent and
full-time arbitration boards provid
ing for voluntary—not compulsory
—arbitration might prevent future
conflict between management and
labor.
