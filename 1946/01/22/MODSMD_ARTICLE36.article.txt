# 'Cornered' Rates As Spy Thriller
## 
### 
; CORNERED—Now playing at the
Varsity Theatre.
"Cornered," Dick Powell's second
| come-back film, is another in the
i embittered hard-boiled school of
pictures that was fostered by "Dou
i ble Indemnity" and has proved ex
' cellent box office material. While
: "Cornered" is not the equal of Pow
ell's first rough-tough mystery,
| "Murder, My Sweet," it neverthe
less generates enough violence to
stand as a superior motion picture.
In "Cornered" Dick Powell is seen
as a near-fanatical dischargee who
is out to get the Fascists who killed
his French bride. The search takes
him to Buenos Aires (it looks sus
piciously like Wilshire boulevard),
; where amid a liberal sprinkling of
cocktail parties and intrigue, Pow
! ell apprehends his man and pum
j mels him to death before the cam
; era's eyes.
i Drawing Room Background
In contrast to the run-down con
I men, bar floozies, and fake psychia
! trists of "Murder, My Sweet," "Cor
nered" takes as its subject matter
; silver-tongued statesmen and de
j cadent intellectuals. While the lat-
I ter crowd certainly offers possibili
ties, the former bunch (combined
with a Los Angeles Main street
i Central avenue setting) would seem
to this reviewer to lend itself better
to Powell's sulky, moody interpre
; tation of an embittered modern. Bui

perhaps we've been reading 100
much pulp literature.
At any rate, "Cornered" has some
crackling dialogue (that will make
the 8.M.0.C.'s even smoother) and
a dynamic fight scene that should
keep you contented.
Taxi Hail Saga
The second attraction, "Ten Cents
A Dance," is supposedly an expose
of the taxi dance halls where serv
icemen get clipped and there's al
ways a card game in the back room.
The "queen of the B's," Jane Fra
zee spits out some old songs that
should have died a natural death
and there's a big ballroom scene in
which all of twelve people are
shown. Even the title of this thing
is chintzy.— Dick Bower.

as a near-fanatical dischargee who
is out to get the Fascists who killed
his French bride. The search takes
him to Buenos Aires (it looks sus
piciously like Wilshire boulevard),
; where amid a liberal sprinkling of
cocktail parties and intrigue, Pow
! ell apprehends his man and pum
j mels him to death before the cam
; era's eyes.
i Drawing Room Background
In contrast to the run-down con
I men, bar floozies, and fake psychia
! trists of "Murder, My Sweet," "Cor
nered" takes as its subject matter
; silver-tongued statesmen and de
j cadent intellectuals. While the lat-
I ter crowd certainly offers possibili
ties, the former bunch (combined
with a Los Angeles Main street
i Central avenue setting) would seem
to this reviewer to lend itself better
to Powell's sulky, moody interpre
; tation of an embittered modern. Bui

perhaps we've been reading 100
much pulp literature.
At any rate, "Cornered" has some
crackling dialogue (that will make
the 8.M.0.C.'s even smoother) and
a dynamic fight scene that should
keep you contented.
Taxi Hail Saga
The second attraction, "Ten Cents
A Dance," is supposedly an expose
of the taxi dance halls where serv
icemen get clipped and there's al
ways a card game in the back room.
The "queen of the B's," Jane Fra
zee spits out some old songs that
should have died a natural death
and there's a big ballroom scene in
which all of twelve people are
shown. Even the title of this thing
is chintzy.— Dick Bower.
