# SIDELINE SLANTS

### ART LEVINSON 
Daily Sports Editor
Yesterday we turned over the Slants reins to Jim Welter, who
was Army editor of the Daily while going through his AST stint
en the Farm. Jim is now awaiting discharge, and happened to
enter the Daily, when he was immediately lassoed, and dragged
up to a typewriter, and told to peck out a column.
And how does he reciprocate this genial feeling? By making
fun of this writer's ability to pick basketball games. Maybe our
prediction was fringed with school patriotism, and that really we
expected to see the Uclans come out first in the basketball hook
up, but we never expected to see the dismal performance that
the Cardinal hoopsters put forth on Friday night. The team,
however, partly compensated their poor showing by their fine
play in the first half of Saturday night tilt. From a 19-9 deficit,
the team brought the score to a respectable figure, 21-20, UCLA
cn the heavy side.
PLAY MERCHANT MARINERS
This Wednesday night the San Mateo Merchant Marines
invade the Pavilion to take on the varsity cagers. Last guarter,
their football aggregation Greyhounded their way to the Farm,
and were promptly slapped into defeat. How their cagers will
fare is another guestion.
Normally the semi-civilian sailors should go down to inglor
ious defeat at the hands of Stanford. But this season has not been
normal in any sense of the word. With only a fair crop of bas
ketball players turning out to Coach Everett Dean, and then
about every man turning up with injuries of one sort or another,
Stanford has been able to start the same five men only in two
games.
First sidelined was Tom Rodman; then Bill Christianson de
faulted via the injury route. Now Jim Hill is hobbling around
with a bum foot. The seriousness of the injury is not known yet,
hut it's a good bet that he won't be playing very much this
weekend against the Trojans of SC.
TROUNCE THE TROJANS
But who knows what we'll do against the Trojans this Friday
and Saturday pm's? Will we trounce the Trojans? Just thinking
what might happen if Jack Nichols or Bobby Kloppenburg get
sharp brings a fever to this writer. . . . Senator Claghorn's the
name, Claghorn, that is.
