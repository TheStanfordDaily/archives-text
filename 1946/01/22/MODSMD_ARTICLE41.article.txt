# Golf Squad Shows Promise
## 
### JOHNNY SABIN 
This will not read like one of
those basketball reviews you saw
in the Daily last week. Stanford's
intercollegiate golf record shows
none of those occasional last-placers
that seem so inevitable in other
sports. Every one of Coach Eddie
Twiggs' seven pre-war golf teams
from 1936 to 1942 went to the N.C.-
A.A. championships.
Four times, in 1!K58. 19159. 1941,
and 1942, Stanford's links team
was the national intercollegiate
champion. Twice, in 1936 and
19:57. Indian teams finished only
one stroke short of the champion
ship. During that time, Sandy
Tatum won the title of national
individual champion, and Warren
Berle and Bud Brownell were
runners-up. This is only parf of
the record that has made Stanford
the outstanding college in golf.
The last two teams that Stanford
fielded were national champs that
topped anything ever seen in col
lege competition. Coach Twiggs'
1941 team set a new record (580)
that broke the previous record, also
set by a Card squad, by twenty-one
strokes. This was one of the teams
led by Brownell. Berle, and Tatum
that made all others look strictly
second rate.
The 1942 squad, also led by
Brownell and company, was
strengthened by the addition of
Frank McCann, then a sophomore.
McCann won the individual coast
championship while his team took
the conference title by sixteen
strokes.
That was the last year of inter
collegiate golf competition for
Stanford. This year Coach Eddie

Twiggs will again coach a varsity
links team which will he led by
Frank McCann, who has returned
from the Air Corps, in addition to
| several other experienced golfers.
Golf comes back to Stanford in
full force this year. Besides the
varsity team, 126 men enrolled for
| golf this quarter. This, according to
Coach Twiggs, "is the heaviest win
ter class enrollment in Stanford his
| tory. Practically all are absolute
j novices." With this sort of interest,
j the Indians will waste no time in
| once again gaining the spotlight in
collegiate golf competition.
