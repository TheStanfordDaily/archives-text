## Injuries Hit Farm Cagers 
### 
Bv SMILEY FARKAS
Adding injury to insult hard on
j the heels of last week-end's twin
J fiasco, comes the news that one of
j the Farm's court mainstays has been
j subjugated by the übiquitous in
jury plague that has wrecked the
Indians.
Jim Hill, curly-headed sailor from
i Texas, who holds down one of the
! Farm's forward spots and is one of
I the best players on the current
squad, is about school today with a
swollen foot.
Hill Injured
Following Saturday night's game,
' Hill's foot proceeded to swell up,
! and yesterday he was taken to Mof
! fett Field for an X-ray. It is be
lieved that he suffered a broken
' bone behind the fourth toe.
Thus the battered Redskins, pum
meled unmercifully by foe and fate,
are in an even more precarious po
sition, if they lose Hill. He will
J probably be sidelined for the San
i Mateo Merchant Marine Academy
| contest tomorrow night, and may
; possibly be benched for the U.S.C.
> series this week-end.
i Other than the injury to Hill, the
squad came through the Uclan se
ries in fairly good shape, although
what sprains and bruises they had
prior to Friday night are still with
j them. As long as adhesive tape
stays off the rationed list, though,
the Farm will continue to field a
team.
Maybe a Win
With regard to the team's chances
this week, the Farm is in position
I to salvage at least one game—the
! one tomorrow night with the Mar
| iners. This one is for free, and tick
ets for the week-end games are now
on sale at the B.A.C. for 50 cents.
Against U.S.C., however, the
j chances are strictly those of any
i upset. The Horse is the overwhelm
j ing favorite; but stranger things
1 have happened. And as Coach Ev
erett Dean says, "Basketball is still
! a funny game." A win over Troy
! is a possibility, even if it isn't very

probable.
Mathematics Aginst Us
Consider first that U.S.C. is still
tied with California for the lead in
the Conference, and will be in no
mood for taking chances against the
weaker teams (i.e., Stanford), no
matter how much of a setup it ap
pears to be.
Secondly, the Big Red is far from
being a cohesive force, save for to
tally unrelated moments of inspira
tion. If the Farm could put together
two halves like the second in the
first Cal game, and the first in the
second U.C.L.A. game, then they
would be the team to beat.
Thirdly, the Thin Red Line does
not possess the manpower or expe
rience or staying ability to put to
gether two good halves in one ball
game against the Conference fives.
No Spirit
And last, but not least by any
means, the rooters have displayed a
surprising amount of apathy where
the team is concerned. One forgets
that Stanford has not played bas
ketball for three years. One forgets
that it is not the simplest thing in
the world to get five men to play
a game together. One forgets that
a losing team is as much a part of
the University as a winning team,
and that if the attitude is one of
"Win or else!" we might just as
well go back to hopscotch.
