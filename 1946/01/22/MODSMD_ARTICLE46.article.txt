# Swim Team Comes Back
## 
### 
Another Stanford team is prep
ping to resume the intercollegiate
wars after a three-year layoff, and
threatens to make a better showing
than any of the other returning var
sity assemblages. Coach Ernie
Brandsten is whipping a potential
winning squad into shape. Though
no schedule has been set due to the
change in the educational system at
the Berkeley institution, the swim
season will probably get under way
sometime in spring quarter. Once
again the competition will be fur
nished by U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Cal

World Record Holder
Though still in the elementary
stages, indications show the nucleus
of a strong swimming team. Coach
Brandsten is still in the process of
getting the boys into the best physi
cal shape and placing them in th<*
proper races.
Unlike other Stanford teams, the
swimming team will be bolstered by
several returning lettermen. Back
from the wars, these veterans plan
to resume their chores of winning.
Top among these returnees is Em
met Cashin, who is no slouch when
it comes to churning up the water
ways. Mr. Cashin is the world rec
ord holder of the 200- and 220-yard
and 200-meter breaststroke, and is
a free-styler of national caliber.
Other lettermen are Ray Rule and
Clinton Eastman, 50- and 100-yard
free-style men; Douglas Goodan,
100 free-style and 150 backstroke,
who is showing great promise; and
Don Bell, a junior who won letters
both as a freshman and sophomore
in the 220- and 440-yard races. Two
other lettermen from the freshman
team are also out for competition:
Frank Schriber, lettered four years
ago here, and James Armstrong,
who won his monogram at Califor
nia.
Championship Material
Because freshmen are allowed to
compete in varsity competition this
year, Coach Brandsten finds a flock
of boys available who are of cham

pionship timber. Heading this wealth
of material is Bob Anderson, who
garnered the national interscholas
tic championships in the 40-, 50-
and 100-yard free-style events.
Another freshie, Harry Brochers,
looks like the goods in the 50- and
150-yard events and shows great
promise for the years to come. Don
ald Hester, N.R.O.T.C. man, is
showing up well in the 100- and
200-yard breaststroke.
' Other competitors for top honors
are Len Sperry and Bob Eschweiler
in the 50 and 100 free-style events;
Ben Holt and Bob Atherlon in back
stroke events; and Chuck Markham
and Klaas 80l in the breaststroke
contest. Also in the race are Martin
Vitousek, brother of the former rec
ord holder five or six years ago;
Hays Rodenbaugh, and George
Mead.
With returning lettermen and
freshmen combined, a champion
might be in the ofßng, though Coach
Brandsten says he is still in search
for championship divers.

Another Stanford team is prep

wars after a three-year layoff, and
threatens to make a better showing

no schedule has been set due to the
change in the educational system at
the Berkeley institution, the swim

World Record Holder
Though still in the elementary
stages, indications show the nucleus
of a strong swimming team. Coach
Brandsten is still in the process of
getting the boys into the best physi
cal shape and placing them in th<*
proper races.
Unlike other Stanford teams, the
swimming team will be bolstered by
several returning lettermen. Back
from the wars, these veterans plan
to resume their chores of winning.
Top among these returnees is Em
met Cashin, who is no slouch when
it comes to churning up the water
ways. Mr. Cashin is the world rec
ord holder of the 200- and 220-yard
and 200-meter breaststroke, and is
a free-styler of national caliber.
Other lettermen are Ray Rule and
Clinton Eastman, 50- and 100-yard
free-style men; Douglas Goodan,
100 free-style and 150 backstroke,
who is showing great promise; and
Don Bell, a junior who won letters
both as a freshman and sophomore
in the 220- and 440-yard races. Two
other lettermen from the freshman
team are also out for competition:
Frank Schriber, lettered four years
ago here, and James Armstrong,
who won his monogram at Califor
nia.
Championship Material
Because freshmen are allowed to
compete in varsity competition this
year, Coach Brandsten finds a flock
of boys available who are of cham

pionship timber. Heading this wealth
of material is Bob Anderson, who
garnered the national interscholas
tic championships in the 40-, 50-
and 100-yard free-style events.
Another freshie, Harry Brochers,
looks like the goods in the 50- and
150-yard events and shows great
promise for the years to come. Don
ald Hester, N.R.O.T.C. man, is
showing up well in the 100- and
200-yard breaststroke.
' Other competitors for top honors
are Len Sperry and Bob Eschweiler
in the 50 and 100 free-style events;
Ben Holt and Bob Atherlon in back
stroke events; and Chuck Markham
and Klaas 80l in the breaststroke
contest. Also in the race are Martin
Vitousek, brother of the former rec
ord holder five or six years ago;
Hays Rodenbaugh, and George
Mead.

freshmen combined, a champion
