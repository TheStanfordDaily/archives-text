# Farm Sport Traditions Embody Stanford Loyalty
## 
### BETH Mac VICAR 
Stirring from the three-year slumber imposed by wartime sports in
activity, some of Stanford's liveliest traditions are this year appearing
again, at the Stadium, the Basketball Pavilion, and wherever all-campus
rallies are sponsored. These traditions, which include every member of
the Stanford Family, are significant as a means of expressing loyalty to

the University.
The Hymn, embodying the Fam
ily's love and pride in Stanford, is
sung at rallies and at the close of !
sports contests as well as after the 1
Senior Ball and commencement.
Men and women stand whenever it
is sung; men remove their hats. j
Perhaps best loved of the foot- |
ball traditions is that of the Axe,
for 4fi years the symbol of Stan
ford-California rivalry. Forged in
1899, the Axe went to San Fran
cisco to a baseball game between
the two teams, and though guard
ed by Indian men, was snatched
by rooters from the rival faction.
So the contest for possession, the
first of many, was on.
Th<? Indians, determined to re- j
cover the Axe, raced after the Cal
men and threw a battle line around i
the Ferry Building, where Califor- 1
nians were boarding the boats for j
Oakland. Despite careful searching,
a Berkeley cocd in the confusion
slipped through the linos, with the |
Axe concealed beneath her skirts, i
For 31 years the Axe was hidden
from the public in a Berkeley bank
vault, brought out only for the an
nual Cal Axe Rally. These 31 years j
were not without retaliation—Stan- [
ford even kidnapped the Cal Sen- -
ior Fence—but the Axe did not re
turn to campus until April 30, 1930.
The "Immortal 21," 21 men from
Sequoia Ilall, had recaptured the j
Axe in front of the Berkeley bank
as the Cal rally team was re
turning it to the vault. The Stan- |
ford men, in (lie guise of news |
photographers, released tear gas j
from their flash bulbs, and in the
confusion that resulted, escaped
i through the maze of autos that
blocked the roads back to the
Farm.
Now offered as the Big Game tro
phy by agreement between the two
! schools, the Axe rests in the lobby
of the Union Store, attached to a
plaque bearing the score of every
game.
At each Big Game—and at no
other games—Stanford rooters con
front the Bear cheering section with j
; a thundering rendition of the Axe
j Yell. Written by Will Irwin in 1896.
I the yell rightfully belongs to Stan
ford, but was adopted by Cal during
' the period they held the Axe.
Other traditions accompanying
] the climax game of the Farm foot
ball season are the Big Game rally, !
held on Thursday night, the Big j
Game Jolly-Up on Friday after- |
noon, and in the evening, the Big j
Game Gaieties.
Following the rally program at
! the Pavilion, rooters throng to
| the gigantic bonfire in the dry bed
of Lake Lagunita. Freshman men
have built the bonfire during the
day, guided by Cardinals and fed
by freshman women. Mid the
j cheers of the students standing
by. the fire is lit, flaring up into
a giant column of fire which, dy-
J ing down, smolders far into the
i night.
On Saturday Ls the game, accented
| by card stunts, band music and en
j thusiastic yells from both sides of j
| the field.
Before the Southern California
rontcst, freshman men parade to
the pre-game rally clad in root
ers' caps and pajamas, swarm to
Roblc to serenade, then caravan
to Paly for a free movie at one of
the theaters. This is the famous
I "Pajamarino."
