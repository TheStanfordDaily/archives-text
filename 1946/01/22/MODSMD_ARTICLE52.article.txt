In discussing the significance of
the sudden resignation of Charles
DeGaulle as President of Francc,
Georges E. Lemaitre, professor of
Romanic Languages, stated that this
break had been expected for a num
ber of months .
"DeGaulle's resignation is the cli
max of the conflict between the
Communists and Socialists, forming
the left winy of the French govern
ment, and DeGaulle, and is no sur
prise to anyone who has been fol
lowing French politics," said Mr.
Lemaitre.
New Government Organization
In giving the history of the con
flict, Mr. Lemaitre explained that
Ihe recent French elections were
two-sided. The people were asked
for a referendum to decide if they
would give full backing to DeGaulle,
and at the same time they were
asked to elect deputies to the Con
stitutional Assembly.
"The conflict arose when the peo
ple elected DeGaulle by an over
whelming majority and at the same
time elected deputies to the Assem

bly who were Communists and So
cialists and opposed to DeGaulle's
policy,"' Mr. Lemaitre went on.
Denying that the French people
were contradictory in their choices,
Mr. Lemaitre explained that they
wanted to keep DeGaulle because
they believed that he was the only
man to direct France, but they also
wanted a social policy inclining to
the extreme left.
Conflicting Factors
"DeGaulle believed that in elect
ing him the people had given him
the full mandate to go ahead," de
clared Mr. Lemaitre, "but the Com
munists and Socialists felt the same
way, especially since they had the
influential recognition of Russia."
The French people have been pa
tient, and have really tried to solve
their problem. DeGaulle has tried
to resign twice before, but both
times it has been unnecessary. "De-
Gaulle has given as his reason for
this final break the question of
army power, but that is only the
deciding factor in his resignation"
said Mr. Lemaitre.
Major Difficulty
"The real difficulty is the ques
tion of the new constitution. De-
Gaulle wants a constitution like
ours with strong executive power,
as he believes that France could be
saved politically if ministerial in
fluence were done away with."
Since the Socialists and Commu
nists are preparing the constitution,
the new government will give the
Chamber of Deputies more power
than they had be/ore the war, and
DeGaulle feels that "it is impossible
to try to continue to agree with the
leftists," concluded Mr. Lemaitre.

In giving the history of the con
flict, Mr. Lemaitre explained that
Ihe recent French elections were
two-sided. The people were asked
for a referendum to decide if they
would give full backing to DeGaulle,
and at the same time they were
asked to elect deputies to the Con
stitutional Assembly.
"The conflict arose when the peo
ple elected DeGaulle by an over
whelming majority and at the same
time elected deputies to the Assem

bly who were Communists and So
cialists and opposed to DeGaulle's
policy,"' Mr. Lemaitre went on.
Denying that the French people
were contradictory in their choices,
Mr. Lemaitre explained that they
wanted to keep DeGaulle because
they believed that he was the only
man to direct France, but they also
wanted a social policy inclining to
the extreme left.
Conflicting Factors
"DeGaulle believed that in elect
ing him the people had given him
the full mandate to go ahead," de
clared Mr. Lemaitre, "but the Com
munists and Socialists felt the same
way, especially since they had the
influential recognition of Russia."
The French people have been pa
tient, and have really tried to solve
their problem. DeGaulle has tried
to resign twice before, but both
times it has been unnecessary. "De-
Gaulle has given as his reason for
this final break the question of
army power, but that is only the
deciding factor in his resignation"
said Mr. Lemaitre.
Major Difficulty
"The real difficulty is the ques
tion of the new constitution. De-
Gaulle wants a constitution like
ours with strong executive power,
as he believes that France could be
saved politically if ministerial in
fluence were done away with."
Since the Socialists and Commu
nists are preparing the constitution,
the new government will give the
Chamber of Deputies more power
than they had be/ore the war, and
DeGaulle feels that "it is impossible
to try to continue to agree with the
leftists," concluded Mr. Lemaitre.
In discussing the significance of
the sudden resignation of Charles
DeGaulle as President of Francc,
Georges E. Lemaitre, professor of
Romanic Languages, stated that this
break had been expected for a num
ber of months .
"DeGaulle's resignation is the cli
max of the conflict between the
Communists and Socialists, forming
the left winy of the French govern
ment, and DeGaulle, and is no sur
prise to anyone who has been fol
lowing French politics," said Mr.
Lemaitre.
