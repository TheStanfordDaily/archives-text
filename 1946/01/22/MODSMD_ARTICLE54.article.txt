# G.M. Refuses 19.5 Increase
## 
### 
DETROIT, Jan. 22 (Tuesday)
(UP). â€”Strikebound General Motors
ignored a midnight deadline im
posed by the CIO United Auto
Workers, who had demanded cor
poration agreement to a 19.5 cents
an hour wage increase.
In accordance with the terms of
their deadline set a week ago, the
auto workers then reverted to their
original demand for a 30 per cent
wage increase from General Motors.
A company spokesman said that
acceptance of the wage increase rec
ommended by President Truman's
fact-finding board would be a re
versal of the position taken Jan. 11
by Charles E. Wilson, company
president, in rejecting the board's re
oort.
While the General Motors strike
of 175,000 workers was stalemated
for the 62nd day, the UAW contin
ued to talk wages with the Ford
Motor Company.
"The midnight deadline set for
Mcneral Motors acceptance of the
fact-finding board's recommenda
tions does not apply to our talks
with Ford," a UAW-CIO spokesman
said.
