# 'Hold That Line-Against Inflation,' President Truman Tells Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UP).—
President Truman today charged
Congress with the task of continu
ing major home front controls in
definitely to prevent disastrous in
flation, "our greatest immediate do
mestic problem."
He added the warning that this
order must be observed until na
tional production comes abreast of
demand and supplies and prices find
their natural level.
To this end, he said, price control
must be extended a full year past
the Jun° 30 exuiration date.
Food Subsidies Will iie Continued
Food subsidies, which he had
planned to abandon, must be re
newed to head off an all-over in
crease of more than 3 per cent in
the cost of living.
Congress should move in fast to
halt inflation in the housing field.
"Our chief worry still is infla
tion," was the idea he hammered
at Congress again and again. In
fact, he said that inflationary pres
sures are so great that he cannot
recommend more tax reductions.
But despite this, he emphasized,
"the critical situation makes con
tinued rent control, price control,
and priorities, allocations, and in

ventory controls absolutely essen
tial."
Full Production—Greatest Weapon
Against Inflation
He said that full production "is
the greatest weapon against infla
tion, but until we can produce
enough goods to meet the threat of
inflation, the government will have
to exercise its wartime control over
prices."
By raising minimum wages as
proposed in legislation now pend- i
ing, he continued, "we will find it
possible to maintain the levels of J
purchasing power needed to sus- j
tain the stable prosperity which we I
desire."
"Production is the only effective |
answer" to the national housing j
shortage and "where private indus
try cannot build, the government j
must step in to do the job."
Selective Service Must Be Continued j
President Truman also told Con
gress that an armed force of 2.000,-
000 men must be maintained through
1946 and urged that it extend the
Selective Service Act beyond May
18 if voluntary enlistments bog
down.
He said ,in his state-of-the-union
and budget message that the na
tion's safety depends on an adequate
fighting force and that extension of
the draft law beyond its expiration
date will be the only alternative if
current enlistment drives fail to
provide Ihe manpower needed.
H? also renewed his request for

action on 21 legislative proposals
which still are pending.
Truman Urges British Loan
He said that the proposed loan to
the United Kingdom ($4,400,000,000)
will contribute to easing the trans
ition problem of one of our major
partners in the war.
j Other new requests included:
A permanent federal school-lunch
j and milk program beginning next
; September.
Means for Hawaii to acquire
statehood. The same for Alaska as
soon as it is determined that this is
j what the people of Alaska want.
A greater measure of self-govern
\ ment for the Virgin Islands and the
District of Columbia.
