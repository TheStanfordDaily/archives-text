# Crisis Hits US Economy
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 21 (UP).—The
nation was in the depths of the
greatest management-labor crisis of
its history tonight with 1,680,000
workers on strike and a slow pa
ralysis which threatened to culmin
ate in 10 days to three weeks in a
strike affecting the jobs of millions.
An industrial authority said it was
"impossible" to exaggerate the re
sult upon the national economy if
the strike of 750,000 steel workers
which began today is prolonged.
The strike virtually shut down the
basic industry upon which 40 per
cent of all industry is dependent for
raw materials.
But no less pressing was the strike
of almost 300.000 packing-house
workers that was bringing the coun
try closer to a meat famine each day
it is continued.
Possible Government Intervention
In financial and industrial circles
here, it was believed that the gov
ernment could not and would not
permit the economic processes of
disintegration set in motion by the
steel wage deadlock to run its
course and wreck the reconversion
program.
Only in meat packing was there
mediation under way and it was of
government origin—by the fact find
ing method which was expected to
take days at least. The deadlock of
General Motors and its 175,000 strik
ing auto workers was unchanged,
as was that of 200,000 striking elec
tric workers employed by General
Electric Co., Westinghouse Elec
tric Corp., and General Motors, elec
tric division.
