# Paris Seethes; De Gaulle Gone

PARIS. Jan. 21 (UP). â€” Gen.
Charles DcGaulle left Paris tonight,
leaving behind him a scene of in
tense political activity in which the
Communist party appeared defeated
I in its first attempts to capture lead
| ership of the French government,
i Communist leader Jacques Duclos
| announced after many meetings that
: the Popular Republican party had
| turned down a Communist propo
| sal to participate in a coalition on
; leftist terms. In a letter, he asked
the Socialists if they would join in
a two-party Socialist - Communist
government or if they insisted on
the three-party coalition.
In event the Socialists refused to
accept a coalition under Communist
leadership, it appeared that Socialist
Vincent Auriol or veteran Radical
Socialist leader Edouard Rerriot
would be favored to head the gov
ernment.
Regulations stipulate that the Pre
mier must receive two-thirds of the
chamber's votes. That would be 380
votes, but Communists and Social
ists together could muster hardly
more than 300 votes, making it nec
essary to agree to some sort of tri
partite solution.
