# Atom Plans Discussed

### 
Seville Chapman, assistant pro
fessor of physics, suggested plans
for making future meetings of the
Student Atomic Control Association
efficient and concise at a meeting
last night. On his recommendation,
a definite time limit of one hour
has been set for all meetings.
The group decided that the future
i agenda of all meetings will include:
j (1) a short discussion of pertinent
j business matters; (2) reports by
j various committees concerning ac
tion to be taken by the group; (3)
a brief resume of latest news items
i concerning international action be
| ing taken in regard to the control
j of atomic energy; (4) a general dis
cussion following a short speech,
on some aspect of the control of the
bomb, by a student or faculty mem-
I ber.
J Various plans for an all-campus
| assembly were presented by Carol
Newton. Of the alternative propo
sals of debate, panel, symposium,
and town meeting, the last was
! adopted by the tfroup.
j The members feel that energy
should be concentrated on efforts
j to control the atomic bomb rather
| than to support larger and more
I theoretical movements such as
world government. The motion
was made and carried that contact
with groups representing any in
ternational matters other than
atomic control will not be sanc
tioned by the association as a
whole, but may be undertaken
I independently by individual mem
bers.
The Association received an ac
knowledgment from Senator Con
nally, chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations, in regard to a
; letter sent earlier. The letter stated
that the group believes that inter
national atomic control offers the
only solution to the problem of the
atomic bomb.
