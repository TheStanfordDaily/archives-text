SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 21 (UP),
i —The Navy plans a peacetime,
three-ocean fleet of 1,050 combat
ships, which will be reconditioned
to wilhstand atomic stress after
atom-bomb tests to be conducted
this spring, Rear Adm. Russell P.
Berkey, disclosed today.
Bcrkey, chief of the Navy's new
ly organized civil liaison section, said
location for the first sea tests of the
atomic bomb had not yet been defi
nitely decided but that all types of
American and captured German and
Japanese vessels would be subjected
to atomic explosions to determine
the effect of the weapon in naval
warfare.
Among the "guinea pigs" will be
the giant Japanese battleship Naga
to, now lying off Yokosuka naval
base near Tokyo, and many carriers,
cruisers, submarines and other war
| ships.
I He pointed out that the tests nec
| essarily must, be held in waters
shallow enough to allow divers to
examine the wreckage of the sun
i ken ships. In that way, the admiral
| said, the Navy hopes to determine
| points of major stress with an eye
! to reinforcing its own ships.
He said plans for the tests are as
| suming the proportions of a major
I amphibious operation with scores of
I ships bearing scientists, engineers
1 and military observers to converge
at the scene.
Revealing the Navy's plans for its
post-war fleet, the admiral stated
that 1,050 fighting ships will be re
tained, one-half of which will be in
an active status and the balance in
active and inactive reserve.
