### 
ATHENS, Jan. 21 (UP). â€”The
I Greek government today rushed re
| inforcements by land and sea to
| ward, Kalamata, southern Pelopon
| nesus port city where 1,500 or more
; rebellious monarchists and rightists
j battled troops and police. Govern
j ment circles called the attack on the
j city part of a royalist plot to over-
J throw Premier Themistocles So
phoulis' regime and restore King
George II to his throne.
A destroyer of the Greek navy
was hurried toward Kalaamta, on
the Gulf of Messinea about 80 miles
southwest of Corinth. Motorized
troops also were rushing toward the
city. A senior air force commander,
sent to direct the defense force, was
expected to open large-scale oper
ations against the lebels as soon as
reinforcements arrived.
Government circles said they be
lieved the Peloponnesus rising was
only part of a general plan to over
throw the government. Royalists
and other right - wing groups in
j Greece have objected that the pres
ent government was not of sufTi-
I cicntly nationalist character to sat
i isfy Greece's aspirations.
