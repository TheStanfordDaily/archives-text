# UNRRA Clothing Drive Ends Today; Contributions 'Slow' from Living Groups
## Chairmen Must Deliver Contributions To Woodpecker Lodge for Packing By 2; Clothes, Shoes, Bedding Needed 
### 
Today is the last day for the collection of garments for the UNRRA
Clothing Drive. Stanford's goal is at least one article of clothing from
every student. So far most of the contributions have come from private
residences on campus.
The living groups have been slow in turning in contributions. Phyllis

Sutherland, Farm chairman of the
drive, states that she hopes this is
due to the fact that the living groups
are waiting until the last day to
turn in the clothes in order that
more articles may be collected.
Where They Go
Miss Sutherland requests that the
boxes of clothing be brought to
Woodpecker Lodge before 2 p.m. in
order for the packing to be com
pleted this afternoon. Student liv
ing groups are asked to furnish their
own transportation to Woodpecker
Lodge.
War Board representatives in ev
ery living group are responsible for
the collection of the clothcs. No
sorting of clothes will be necessary.
Garments should be placed in a
large box and taken to the collec
tion point.
What to Give
The types of clothing needed are:
coats, sui's, trousers, skirts, dresses,
shirts, sweaters, knitwear, under
wear, pajamas, night gowns, shoes
(also galoshes, overshoes, rubbers),
blankets, bedding, piece goods, and
draperies.
Donors are reminded to attach
belts to garments and to tie pairs of
shoes together, to prevent slowing
up in the handling of the clothes.
Clothing need not be in perfect
repair, but should be useful to the
people who will receive it. Used
clothing for both summer and win
ter is needed.
Which to Wash
Washable garments should be
washed before they are given to the
collection, but they need not be
ironed. Other garments should be
clean and sanitary, but need not be
dry-cleaned before being contrib
uted.
The following articles are not de
sired in the clothing drive: straw
hats, toys, feather beds, pillows,
mattresses, novelties, and household
furnishings.
Where It Goes
The clothing gather in this drive
will be shipped through the United
Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
Administration to countries where
the devastations of war have dislo
cated the civilian supplies and the
civilian economy. Distribution will
be worldwide, to the Far East and
the Philippines as well as to the
war-torn countries of Europe. Dis
tribution of garments will be free
and without discrimination of any
kind.
Approximately 25.000.000 people
in the war-torn countries have al
ready received clothing donated by
the American people in the United
Nations Clothing Collection of last
spring. This number is only a small
percentage of the destitute and
homeless people of the world who
need the aid of the UNRRA. The
national goal for this drive has been
set at 100.000.000.
