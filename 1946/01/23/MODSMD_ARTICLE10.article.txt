# McCall, Falk Win Debate Tournament
## Winners Oppose Free Trade Policy For United States 
### 
Wallace McCall and Lee Falk de
feated Dorothy Gilbert and Don
Germain yesterday to become win
ners of Debate Society's intramural
tournament.
Falk and McCall took the nega
tive side of the question "Resolved:
that the policy of the United States
should be directed toward the estab
lishment of free trade among the
nations of the world."
While generally the advocates of
free trade are the "liberals" of the
contest, the situation was reversed
yesterday when the winning team
offered a counter-proposal of "scien
tific economic planning," including
reciprocal trade agreements and
control of exports and imports.
Free Trade for Peace
Gilbert and Germain, speaking for
free trade, maintained that it is nec
essary for continued peace. They
argued tint protective tariffs have
failed by consistently causing war.
Bluntly demanding that wo adopt
free trade now, the affirmative
speakers stated that now, and only
now, is America in a position where
it can force all nations to accept free
trade. "We have used power poli
tics before," they said, "so let us
now use them once more—this time
for a good end."
Objections:
Five main objections to free trade
were advanced by Falk and McCall:
1. that it would lead to overspecial
ization, forcing us to shut down
many of our industries; 2. that it
would deprive us of the opportunity
to develop new industries'; 3. that it
would deprive us of materials es
sential to national defense;
4. that if we adopt free trade
while other nations do not, it would
give them automatic benefits by giv
ing their tariff-protected industries
a direct advantage over our unpro
tected ones; and 5. that protective
tariffs do not harm the American
consumer.
Tough Underdogs
Gilbert and Germain, who entered
the contest as underdogs, fought
aggressively, and lost to the team
with more experience. The contest
was no "walkaway" for the winners,
however, at; witnessed by the ver
dict of the three judges which was
split two to one.
Falk deserves special credit for
his smooth delivery and well organ
ized case. An award for originality
should go to Germain who analyzed
the question in terms of journalism's
"5 w's"—who, what, when, where,
and why.
Debate Society will meet again at
4 p.m. tomorrow for contests on
peace-time conscription and the
control of atomic energy.

Debate Society will meet again at
4 p.m. tomorrow for contests on
peace-time conscription and the
control of atomic energy.
Wallace McCall and Lee Falk de
feated Dorothy Gilbert and Don
Germain yesterday to become win
ners of Debate Society's intramural
tournament.
Falk and McCall took the nega
tive side of the question "Resolved:
that the policy of the United States
should be directed toward the estab
lishment of free trade among the
nations of the world."
While generally the advocates of
free trade are the "liberals" of the
contest, the situation was reversed
yesterday when the winning team
offered a counter-proposal of "scien
tific economic planning," including
reciprocal trade agreements and
control of exports and imports.
Free Trade for Peace
Gilbert and Germain, speaking for
free trade, maintained that it is nec
essary for continued peace. They
argued tint protective tariffs have
failed by consistently causing war.
Bluntly demanding that wo adopt
free trade now, the affirmative
speakers stated that now, and only
now, is America in a position where
it can force all nations to accept free
trade. "We have used power poli
tics before," they said, "so let us
now use them once more—this time
for a good end."
Objections:
Five main objections to free trade
were advanced by Falk and McCall:
1. that it would lead to overspecial
ization, forcing us to shut down
many of our industries; 2. that it
would deprive us of the opportunity
to develop new industries'; 3. that it
would deprive us of materials es
sential to national defense;
4. that if we adopt free trade
while other nations do not, it would
give them automatic benefits by giv
ing their tariff-protected industries
a direct advantage over our unpro
tected ones; and 5. that protective
tariffs do not harm the American
consumer.
Tough Underdogs
Gilbert and Germain, who entered
the contest as underdogs, fought
aggressively, and lost to the team
with more experience. The contest
was no "walkaway" for the winners,
however, at; witnessed by the ver
dict of the three judges which was
split two to one.
Falk deserves special credit for
his smooth delivery and well organ
ized case. An award for originality
should go to Germain who analyzed
the question in terms of journalism's
"5 w's"—who, what, when, where,
and why.
