# Labor Issue Discussed
## 
### 
A hard-hitting industrial - labor
consultant told his Tuesday Evening
Series audience last night that la
bor-management relations are ruled
by "emotional men, not law."' Until
younger men, with objective view
points, who are interested in the
general good and not personal profit
enter the field as business managers
and labor leaders, labor relations
will remain a game of "bluff and
force."
Answering "yes" to his question
"Are labor and management in
dulging in self-destruction," Com
mander E. J. Damson, assistant per
sonnel director of the Los Alamos
Laboratory of Atomic Energy, out
lined the tug-of-war between the
industrial manager and the union
business agent, which, if it continues
long enough, will result in the loss
of free enterprise. The labor unions
have found in politics a weapon
against industry and will use it in
stead of dealing directly with in
dustry.
The Issue:
The issue is "Who shall take less—
the stockholder or the worker?"
Mr. Damson said. When the stock
holder is forced to take less, lie will
withdraw his capital from industry,
jobs will be less and government
will take over to nrovide jobs.
He pointed out that manager and
union leaders, pursuing the policy
of "more and more" profit, are the
victims of a business system built
on a misconception of the words
"need" and "want." People's wants
have been created by millions of
dollars of advertising. Ownership ol
material things is the goal of the
public. Business has created this
want and will not share its profits
to satisfy it.
Subjective Men
Neither labor tior business is con
cerned with economic equilibruim,
Mr. Dcmson emphasized. The
union's agent must produce profits
for his union to keep his job. He is
subjective and not concerned with
the consumer until he needs the
public behind his cause.
Neither does the business manager
have time to think of the larger is
sue. "He is chained to a production
schedule and must protect his in
terests with his bosses," the speaker
continued. He too, must play poli
tics.
Solution?
"Our hope is for young people
who wish to serve the public first
and themselves second," Mr. Dcm
son said. "We must not frown on
their becoming labor leaders. A
man without an axe to grind can
