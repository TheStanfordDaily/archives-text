# Stanford Quintet Plays Mateo Middies Tonight; Cards Out for Third Win
## Ex-Collegians Pace Middie Attack Ah Many Injuries Hamper Big Red; Victory Hopes Fade for S.C. Games 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
The Stanfords take to the court at the Pavilion again tonight looking
for their third win of the season when they take on the San Mateo Mer
chant Marine Academy quintet. Game time is 8 p.m.. and the "B's" start
the ball rolling when they tangle with the visiting J.V. squad.
Tonight's fray is the Big Reds' chance to clamber into the win column

again, for if the Farm's record Is un
impressive, so is the Midshipmen's
slate. Considering the cold figures,
though, the Mariners are batting
1.000, having won both their pre
vious starts.
Farm Chances
Consider, also, that the two teams
they have beaten are HollLster J.C.
and Salinas J.C., both currently
considered sub-par even in their
own league, and you will realize
just how close the Farm is to turn
ing in a triumph.
Three ex - collegians spearhead
the Middle attack, and while this is
their first season together, they have
been working out often enough up
the Peninsula to give them at least
a thin veneer of experience.
Middic Pacer
Setting the pace is Phil Harman,
an ex-University of Pennsylvania
eager, who with G. Laraja, formerly
of the Virginia Military Institute,
will hold down the backcourt spots.
The other lad with some sort of
experience is Fred Blowers, who
played for the University of Wash
ington. Blowers and Phil Bulger are
the starting forwards, and Bill Soiku
is at center.
Still Sad News
For the Farm, the news continues
to be sad. Jim Hill, the stellar start
ing forward, Ls definitely out of to
night's game, and will probably be
out for the remainder of the week,
which means the U.S.C. series Fri
day and Saturday as well.
Coach Everett Dean has indicated
that he will start his "strongest"
team, nevertheless, which will prob
ably put Gene Martin back at for
ward replacing Hill, and Jack Mer
edith at the other upcourt position.
Card Openers
Max King will in all probability
open at center for the Cards, giving
big Bill O Brien a chance to rest his
troubled feet. Tom Rodman and
Bill Christiansen, the adhesive tape
twins, will open at the guards. If
all goes as planned, the reserves
; should make more than just an oc
casional showing on the court.
Concerning the U.S.C. series, the
outlook is none too hopeful; but it;
is not as bleak as some so-called
"experts" about the campus claim
it is. There have been times when
the team has played a pretty spotty
game, and then again the team has
turned in several sparkling perfor
mances.
Rooters Slacking
At any rate, it appears that the
student body has thrown in the
towel as far as the basketball team
is concerned. Considering the slow
ness with which tickets for the game
are moving, it is doubtful if there
will be more than a handful of root
ers present.
U.S.C. will bring an imposing ar
ray of stars, Bobby Kloppenberg
and Jack Nichols being their top
men; but if the Farm is in shape and
can hit with its elosc ones, look for
some ireworks.
