# Rally Com Writes
## 
### 
Stanford Student Body:
i'h- re are few students left at Stanford who
1 v and understand the functions of Rally
Coi • littee. When it was organized, its purpose
was 'o unify the students and revive the spirit
the l .t vi lagged during the war years. How
ever, Fully Com cannot create this spirit —that
rnu.<:' come from the students themselves.
!_k 1 00l spirit to us means enthusiastic inter
t t and participation in every activity that bears
the school's name, regardless of competitive
odd -i and personal disinterest. It is easy to root
for the winning team, but it is another matter to
support the team when it is losing. Here lies
the t si of true school spirit. Rally Com is will
ing i put its utmost efforts and time into furth
er, n j this spirit, but its needs your cooperation.
We were glad to see the article in Monday's
Dail/ concerning the improvement to the
Farm's rooting section because we also agree
that "we can't yell without a cheer leader,"
"o.ir cheer leaders should have megaphones,"
"the yells should be circulated so that people
will be more familiar with them," "the students
don't know the yells," and "there should be a
special rooting section."
We feel that some explanation must be given
to these statements. First, the head yell leader
is elected spring guarter by you, the students,
lie an ex-ofiicio member of Cardinals, and he
is therefore not responsible to Rally Committee
in any way except through his own willing co
operation. Stanford has been without a head
yell leader since the end of fall guarter, and an
emergency election could not be financed by
the election board until the end of February.
The assistant cheer leaders are appointed by
Cur ! aals and are under the control of the head
yell leader alone. This unusual situation left
the school with two assistant leaders who had
relatively little experience leading yells at
Stanford. Therefore, they could not be respon
sible for directing an assembly to teach new as
well as eld yells to the students.
The megaphones formerly used were lost
soon after Rally Com was disbanded in 1942,
and new ones have not been available since
the war started.
In regard to the disorganization of Rally Com
mittee at the basketball games, we have not
been permitted by the Board of Athletic Con
trol to usher or to organize a special rooting
section because the B.A.C. feels that these mat
ters can be better controlled by student police.
There is still some guestion about the circula
tion of song sheets inside the Pavilion. Rally
Com has 5,000 of these on hand and will see
that some method of distribution is worked out.
One of Stanford's traditions has been never
to have a basketball rally, and this tradition
plus the yell leader situation are the reasons
that there has been no rally this guarter. We
might say, however, that this is one time that a
tradition should be broken because of the re
luming veterans and the limited amount of in
tercollegiate sports activities. If we could be
•: :: ured of the support of the student body, we
would gladly sponsor a rally. Monday's article
convinced us that the students are as interested
as we are.
We hope that this letter has cleared up the
doubts in the students' minds as to the sup
posed inactivity of Rally Committee this guar
ter. Naturally, we cannot release all our future
plans at this time, but our minutes are open to
anyone who feels that we have not attempted
to do all that you reguested in the past or all
that you desire for the future.
vVe appreciate the interest shown by your
criticism as well as your support of our past
activities. The purpose of this letter is not to
shift the blame to anyone else but rather to
clarify the situation. Ironing out the many dif
culties, however, depends upon the continued
cooperation between Rally Committee and the
Stanford student body.

We were glad to see the article in Monday's
Dail/ concerning the improvement to the
Farm's rooting section because we also agree
that "we can't yell without a cheer leader,"
"o.ir cheer leaders should have megaphones,"
"the yells should be circulated so that people
will be more familiar with them," "the students
don't know the yells," and "there should be a
special rooting section."
We feel that some explanation must be given
to these statements. First, the head yell leader
is elected spring guarter by you, the students,
lie an ex-ofiicio member of Cardinals, and he
is therefore not responsible to Rally Committee
in any way except through his own willing co
operation. Stanford has been without a head
yell leader since the end of fall guarter, and an
emergency election could not be financed by
the election board until the end of February.
The assistant cheer leaders are appointed by
Cur ! aals and are under the control of the head
yell leader alone. This unusual situation left
the school with two assistant leaders who had
relatively little experience leading yells at
Stanford. Therefore, they could not be respon
sible for directing an assembly to teach new as
well as eld yells to the students.
The megaphones formerly used were lost
soon after Rally Com was disbanded in 1942,
and new ones have not been available since
the war started.
In regard to the disorganization of Rally Com
mittee at the basketball games, we have not
been permitted by the Board of Athletic Con
trol to usher or to organize a special rooting
section because the B.A.C. feels that these mat
ters can be better controlled by student police.
There is still some guestion about the circula
tion of song sheets inside the Pavilion. Rally
Com has 5,000 of these on hand and will see
that some method of distribution is worked out.
One of Stanford's traditions has been never
to have a basketball rally, and this tradition
plus the yell leader situation are the reasons
that there has been no rally this guarter. We
might say, however, that this is one time that a
tradition should be broken because of the re
luming veterans and the limited amount of in
tercollegiate sports activities. If we could be
•: :: ured of the support of the student body, we
would gladly sponsor a rally. Monday's article
convinced us that the students are as interested
as we are.
We hope that this letter has cleared up the
doubts in the students' minds as to the sup
posed inactivity of Rally Committee this guar
ter. Naturally, we cannot release all our future
plans at this time, but our minutes are open to
anyone who feels that we have not attempted
to do all that you reguested in the past or all
that you desire for the future.
vVe appreciate the interest shown by your
criticism as well as your support of our past
activities. The purpose of this letter is not to
shift the blame to anyone else but rather to
clarify the situation. Ironing out the many dif
culties, however, depends upon the continued
cooperation between Rally Committee and the
Stanford student body.
