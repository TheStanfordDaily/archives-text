Editor, Stanford Daily:
The Stanford Band has ceased to exist, in
spite of the fact that Stanford, registration has
reached a record high. So many students have
expressed surprise over this news that I take
this means of explaining a few of the reasons:
The Stanford Band ceased to exist as a
civilian band in 1942; but the ASTP soldiers

gave it a shot in the arm which kept a band
going until last month when the Army pulled
out.
Nov/ one of two things is certain: either there
are a lot of bashful instrumentalists who have
not turned up for Band, or else there are not
enough players on the campus to have a band
at all. I believe the latter is the case. Why?
The reason is simple. The high schools, in
many cases, have ceased band instruction dur
ing the war, and Stanford students come from
these high schools. The boys who went into
the Army did not keep up their music because
they soon found out that Army bands are not
roads to advancement. Thousands of music
teachers went to war also, and left unfilled va
cancies in our schools. Several of these teach
ers have registered for advanced work in mus
sic education here this guarter, so we have al
most as many band directors as players here
on campus.
If you students want a fine band, begin writ
ing, not to this faculty and administration, but
to your Boards of Education at home. In some
benighted communities, as in Redwood City
nearby, the Boards have cut out instrumental
work entirely because of the demand for "prac
tical" subjects. Redwood City has had a fine
band instructor for years at Seguoia High, but
he is now teaching mathematics!
Also write to your parents and to the alumni.
They all loved to see and hear the Stanford
Band at the games, but "Come Join the Band"
is sung in vain unless the public will do some
thing about this problem. Only ten students
turned up Monday night and three were drum
mers.—Warren D. Allen, professor of music and
education.
