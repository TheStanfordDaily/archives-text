### STANLEY WILSON 
My apology of the season goes to our good friends,
the Boathouse Boys. In yesterday's writing, I said
something about the Boathouse still having California
Bear signs on it. Apparently I botched. In the after
noon mail I received the following goodie, which I
will quote verbatim:
"Dear Mister Wilson: Wise up. The Boathouse was
painted a week ago. (Signed) The Boathouse Boys."
Sorry. I'm wised up. I've got the picture. My
humble apology and appreciation for giving me the
word. But the only way a person could see that sign
would be by going along the road to the golf course or
to a certain beer den up the mountainside. Everyone
knows that I'm not athletic and everyone knows I
don't imbibe. There's my excuse. Anyhow, thanks
fellas.

I overheard an interesting conversation on Quad
the other day which had something to do with the
caliber of Stanford women this year, 1946. Apparently
a couple of ex-service boys were involved in the
conversation. It Went something like this: "You
know, I don't know if the Stanford women look better
now than four years ago or jot. But they sure seem
to have a lot more than the bunch that was here be
fore I left for the Navy." To which another fellow re
plied: "Yeh, but you have to consider that we've been
overseas for about three years and looking at nothing
but 'gooks.' Anything would look good after that!"
. . . For your information, girls, "gooks" are third
cousins of the Übangis. I guess you coeds just can't
win. But just remember, there is a good possibility
the ratio will be cut down and then you can once more
begin to move without too much competition. I'm sure
glad I'm not interested in that sort of thing!

A friend and fellow Daily peon - laborer just
dropped in and suggested something worth passing on.
It regards the policy of the B.A.C. in respect to ticket
sales. The suggestion forwarded to me was to place
the B.A.C. ducat booth in a more central location to
facilitate ticket sales. The B.A.C. building is an out-of
the-way place, and most students will put off buying
tickets to a forthcoming game because of the inacces
sibility of the B.A.C. And by the way, does anyone
have two rooters' tickets he would sell me at the scalp
ers' ceiling price?

Be sure and take a glance at the Campus Opinion
column in today's Daily, written by Rally Com. It is
worth reading and worth some thought. Glad some
one is reacting to student opinion.

have two rooters' tickets he would sell me at the scalp

Be sure and take a glance at the Campus Opinion
column in today's Daily, written by Rally Com. It is
worth reading and worth some thought. Glad some
one is reacting to student opinion.
My apology of the season goes to our good friends,
the Boathouse Boys. In yesterday's writing, I said
something about the Boathouse still having California
Bear signs on it. Apparently I botched. In the after
noon mail I received the following goodie, which I
will quote verbatim:
"Dear Mister Wilson: Wise up. The Boathouse was
painted a week ago. (Signed) The Boathouse Boys."
Sorry. I'm wised up. I've got the picture. My
humble apology and appreciation for giving me the
word. But the only way a person could see that sign
would be by going along the road to the golf course or
to a certain beer den up the mountainside. Everyone
knows that I'm not athletic and everyone knows I
don't imbibe. There's my excuse. Anyhow, thanks
fellas.

I overheard an interesting conversation on Quad
the other day which had something to do with the
caliber of Stanford women this year, 1946. Apparently
a couple of ex-service boys were involved in the
conversation. It Went something like this: "You
know, I don't know if the Stanford women look better
now than four years ago or jot. But they sure seem
to have a lot more than the bunch that was here be
fore I left for the Navy." To which another fellow re
plied: "Yeh, but you have to consider that we've been
overseas for about three years and looking at nothing
but 'gooks.' Anything would look good after that!"
. . . For your information, girls, "gooks" are third
cousins of the Übangis. I guess you coeds just can't
win. But just remember, there is a good possibility
the ratio will be cut down and then you can once more
begin to move without too much competition. I'm sure
glad I'm not interested in that sort of thing!

A friend and fellow Daily peon - laborer just
dropped in and suggested something worth passing on.
It regards the policy of the B.A.C. in respect to ticket
sales. The suggestion forwarded to me was to place
the B.A.C. ducat booth in a more central location to
facilitate ticket sales. The B.A.C. building is an out-of
the-way place, and most students will put off buying
tickets to a forthcoming game because of the inacces
sibility of the B.A.C. And by the way, does anyone
have two rooters' tickets he would sell me at the scalp
ers' ceiling price?
