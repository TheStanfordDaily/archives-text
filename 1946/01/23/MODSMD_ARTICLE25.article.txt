WAGES AND PRICES
The policy of higher wages and lower prices that
President Truman recommends seems premature now.
We do not know what productivity we have in terms
of peace-time products, and only when that is found
out can an economic policy either be worked out or
else work itself out.
If lower prices and higher wages are arbitrarily
enforced now, the big companies, which have great
financial reserves, can keep operating at a stupendous
loss, but the little fellows might go out of business.
WAGE STANDARD
The only possible standard for wages can be pro
ductivity. Th? fact-finding boards up to now have
recognized that. If wages increase but the total num
ber of products on the market does not, either prices
will be higher or, if they are fixed, some people will
have to do without. Therefore any wage increase that
ignores what labor produces is a fiction.
In many cases in the present industrial setup, labor
is getting less than it should, and it is striking for what
it deserves. The companies that are facing the strikes
will, if they do proper justice, settle on the basis of
financial reserves.
But a long-term wage and price policy can only be
determined when it is found out, by actual experience,
what we can make in the way of consumer goods for a
year. We won't know that until 1947, and maybe later.
Until then, any long-term idea on wages and prices
cannot be made safely.
