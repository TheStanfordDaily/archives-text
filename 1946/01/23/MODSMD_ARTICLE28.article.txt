### HELEN PINKERTON 
Cubberley House, the former
Kappa Alpha Theta house, is named
for Ell wood Patterson and Helen
Van Uxem Cubberley.
i When the Cubberleys came to
I Stanford in 1898, the Thetas lived
!in a rented house. A Theta, from
| Indiana, and still an undergraduate,
j Mrs. Cubberley was interested in
, the welfare of the Stanford chap
j ter and she and Professor Cubber
ley lent their aid toward the estab
! lishment of the house which be
! longed to the Thetas until the Uni
' versity abolished sororities recently.
â–  Education Head
Professor Cubberley came to the
young University to head the fail
ing Department of Education at the
request of David Starr Jordan, un

( der whom he had studied at Indiana
University. Under his direction the
I School of Education was organized
in 1017, of which he became Dean
i and remained until his retirement
in 1033. Even after his retirement
Professor Cubberley devoted his
time and energy to the reorganiza
tion of the Education library.
One of the country's noted edu
| cators, Professor Cubberley edited
! the Riverside Series of textbooks
! and wrote several books on educa
; tion administration and the history
J of education, bis particular interest.
! It was from the profits of his writ-
I ing. and editing that the Cubberleys
j were able to give to the University
{ the School of Education Building
| which was dedicated in November
! 1938.
| Donate Education Building
Although perhaps the Education
Building is their largest single con-
I tribution to the- University, the
Cubberleys will be remembered as
being among the kindliest and most
generous members of the Stanford
Family in their personal relation
ships with the students of the Farm.
Since Professor Cubberley's death
! in 1941, Mrs. Cubberley has given
i their home, Hilltop House, to the
! University as a residence for grad
: uate women. She still fives there,
j devoting her time to reading and
| genealogical research.
I
Interested in Students
In speaking of the special inter-
I ests of herself and her husband,
; Mrs. Cubberley said that Mr. Cub
berley was interested in the men
j students and she in helping the
J women of Stanford. Mr. Cubberley
helped establish Phi Delta Kappa,
national honorary education frater
| nity, and helped carry on the Stan
! ford tradition of faculty - student
friendship by having his students to
I his home for classes and often so
j eially.

Mrs. Cubberley, as secretary
; treasurer of the Women's Clubhouse
for 18 years, assisted in the long and
hard task of raising money to finish
the building. "Money was not so
plentiful for the Clubhouse in those
| days, before the 500 limit was taken
i of!' the women's registration, so it
was slow and hard work," Mrs.
Cubberley said. "We gave teas and
other affairs and gradually the up-
I per floors were completed."
Stanford Dames
j The Stanford Dames, an organi-
I zation for students' wives, is also
j one of Mrs. Cubberley's special in
! terests. She, with some friends,
I wrote to other colleges for ideas and
i with their assistance organized the
i Stanford group.
Mrs. Cuboerley was graduated
from Stanford in 1900 and made an
honorary member of Phi Beta Kap
| pa in 1905 and a member of Cap and
! Gown ?n 1922.
