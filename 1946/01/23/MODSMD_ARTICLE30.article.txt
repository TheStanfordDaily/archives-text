# Paper Shortage Hits Bookstore
## 
### 
Increased registration this quar
ter has caused a headache for the
Bookstore because among the short
ages that will continue for months
to come is the shortage of textbooks.
Despite the fact that textbook
I publishers use but 2 per cent of
j all book paper manufactured, they
J were cut because of the greatly in
creased use of paper by various
i governmental agencies, with prior
! ity on the supply.
Unfortunately, the recent removal
of governmental restrictions on pa
per and cloth does not mean
that textbooks will become imme
diately plentiful. A recent authori
tative survey indicates that there
will be shortages of paper, cover
cloth, skilled labor, and new ma
chinery to replace worn-out ma
: chinery, throughout 1C46.
