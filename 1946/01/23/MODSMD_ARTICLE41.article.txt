# Cardinal Baseball Team Needs More Prospects
## 
### "TEX" ROTENBERG 
j Remember last week when our
| plea was, "if you know the differ
ence between a cross bar and a
track shoe, Coach Weiershauser
wants to make your acquaintance"?
Now we are changing the gag to fit
the appropriate sport. Ready: If
you know the difference between a
scratch single and a foul bull, you
' can try out for the baseball team.
The season won't start until spring
j quarter so there is still plenty of
| time to limber up the old arm, and
i strengthen the vocal chords. Three
[ oldtimers are back, two from the
! pitching corps and one outfielder.
Flatland and Wolf are the hurlers
S Coach Wolter is depending on for
! heavy mound duty and Kellenberg
er has the rail in the i*ace for a
garden spot. But as you probably
know if you've been discharged
since 1923, it takes nine good men
I to make a winning ball club. This
; leads us to say again that if you
| think you can provide some compe
j tition for any position you will get a
thorough tryout and credit in Phys
! ical Education.
Team Needs Manager
If you don't like to chew gum or
j wear knickers but would still like
| to do something for our eager base
ball outfit, come out and win a well
i earned lelter as a manager. Coach
| Wolter needs a manager as much as
i an ace first sacker.
There will be a southern division
j conference this season including
| U.C.L.A., Cal, U.S.C. and Stanford.
; Each team will play every other six
times. Our nine will also try to
| make some dates with other squads
in this territory. These games will
| all be held on the Farm. So if you
| run across any cocky baseball game
promoters send them over to Harry
; Wolter who wants to schedule a
j couple of practice victims.
Fundamentals Taught
The coach is spending the long
afternoons fungoing flies out and
knocking the pill around the infield.
He's trying to get Ihe boys well
grounded in fundamentals. The fel
lows who haven't had any varsity
I experience need this kind of work
before concentrating on the finer
points of the game like sliding, base
stealing, bunting, etc.
The players, realizing the team
has to be reshaped from scratch,

are really earnest about getting in
condition, loosening up the legs and
shoulders, and building up their
wind. It's really a fine spirit that
makes the hopefuls trot around the
park, lap after lap, to burn off ex
cess weight.
Team Inexperienced
The picture of all Stanford sports
this year is about the same. None of
the teams have much but willing
novices. We shouldn't expect too
much of the pioneering baseball
team, but when the time comes, let's
all be out there rooting for them.
They deserve a lot of backing from
the student body for the efforts they
are putting forth to give the Farm a
fighting ball club.
