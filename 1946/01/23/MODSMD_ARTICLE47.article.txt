# Golden Era of Cage Starts With Luisetti
## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
Here we are at last, 1936, the first
of a three-year "golden era" of
Stanford basketball supremacy. This
was also the first year of eligibility
of the Farm's all-time great, Angelo
"Hank" Luisetti, who led the Car
dinals to their first championship
in 15 years. The '36 season also
marked the first time since 1921 that
the Indians won more than one
game from the California Bears in
one r.eason.
Luisetti's running mate at the
forward slot was Howell Turner, a
letterman from the 1935 season. At
center was Art Stoefen, and at
guards were Captain "Dinty"
Moore and either Jack Calderwood,
Bob Zonne or Sparky Robertson.
Moore, all-conference the year be
fore, was injured a good part of
the 1936 season, however.
Luisetti Sets Record
The Indians started off the year
by subduing College of the Pacific,
71-40. Next came Utah State, and
with the sensational sophomore
scoring 31 points for a new San
Francisco auditorium record, Stan
ford won, 73-34. Then after winning
two more easy victories over Santa
Clara and the Olympic Club, the
Cardinals lost their first two games
of the season to the University of
Washington in Seattle. The Indians
then returned to the Pavilion to de
feat San Jose State, Utah, and Ne
braska, and wind up their pre-sea
son record with seven wins and
two defeats.
Stanford started off the confer
ence season by splitting a pair of
games with the U.C.LA. Bruins.
The Indians won the first contest,
44-30, but the Bruins came back
strong on Saturday to win, 44-37.
The Uclan ace, center John Ball,
scored 36 points for the two games,
while Luisetti countered with 27 for
Stanford.
Beat Cal
The next Friday, the Cards met
California in the first of a four
game series. Playing at home, Stan
ford won in a hard-fought contest,
41-38, as Luisetti again set the scor
ing pace with 22 points.
The following week-end we went
up against the leading Trojans of
U.S.C., and displaced them in the
league lead with two victories. The
first night the Farm team won 32-25,
but the second night was an entirely
different story. With nine minutes
remaining to play, the Trojans had
what looked to be a safe 15-point
lead. However, a certain sophomore
hadn't begun to warm up yet. At
this point he got red-hot and poured
seven straight baskets through the
hemp to «cut the lead to one point.
When the firing had stopped, Stan
ford had won, 51-47, and Luisetti,

I sprained ankle and all, had scored
l 'JO points.
Then came the Bears again, and
our ancient rivals knocked us back
into a tie with the Trojans by win
ning 39-35.
Ball Scores 43 Points
Back to the conference again, the
Indians regained the lead by belt
ing the Bruins twice, 45-32 and 49-
| 35, while California and Southern
California were splitting a pair of
contests. Center John Ball was
again hot and scored 43 points in
, the two games to pull within 15
points of Luisetti for the conference
lead. Hank was held to 16 points
in these two games.
The next week the Golden Bear
rose up again to beat the favored
j Stanford varsity to the tune of 63-
I 30. Luisetti scored half of his team's
> points. The loss again put Stanford
I into a tie with U.S.C.
Then came the all-important Tro-
I jan series. The two teams remained
I in a tie, however, by splitting the
two games. The Trojans won the
first 45-36, but the Indians came
j back to win the Saturday night
| game 46-42, as Luisetti scored 20
j ooints.
Stanford and U.S.C. both won
their last game the next Friday to
finish the regular season in a tie
1 with eight wins and four losses. The
! Indians beat Cal 40-26. and South
ern California defeated the Bruins
I 55-28. That win over California
shattered a 15-year "jinx" that had
I never allowed Stanford to win more
| than one game over Cal in a season.
I Stanford Wins Crucial
To play off the tie the Indians met
J the Trojans in a single game in the
Pavilion. Stanford distributed their
points very evenly while Jack Hupp
| scored 19 for the Tmajns, but U.S.C.
was still 3 points behind as the game
I ended.
The Indians then got a chance to
turn the tables on the Washington
1 Huskies, the winners of the North
ern Division. This they did in no
uncertain fashion. In the first game
at Seattle Stanford won with a ter
-1 rific scoring barrage. 60-39. Luiset
ti again was high point man with
32 points. The second game in the
Pavilion saw the Cards win again,
i 48-38. This time Hank had to be
content with 21 points.
Lost to Oregon State
Still not through, the Indians
went back to Seattle to play for the
right to go to Madison Square Gar
den and perhaps to the Olympic
j Games in Berlin, but overconfidence
[ caught up with them and the lost
to Oregon State, 33-23.
This concluded a very successful
season, but was just a start for Lui
setti. He had scored 401 points in
26 games, and was well on his way
1 to an all-time scoring record.

game series. Playing at home, Stan
ford won in a hard-fought contest,
41-38, as Luisetti again set the scor
ing pace with 22 points.
The following week-end we went
up against the leading Trojans of
U.S.C., and displaced them in the
league lead with two victories. The
first night the Farm team won 32-25,
but the second night was an entirely
different story. With nine minutes
remaining to play, the Trojans had
what looked to be a safe 15-point
lead. However, a certain sophomore
hadn't begun to warm up yet. At
this point he got red-hot and poured
seven straight baskets through the
hemp to «cut the lead to one point.
When the firing had stopped, Stan
ford had won, 51-47, and Luisetti,

I sprained ankle and all, had scored
l 'JO points.
Then came the Bears again, and
our ancient rivals knocked us back
into a tie with the Trojans by win
ning 39-35.
Ball Scores 43 Points
Back to the conference again, the
Indians regained the lead by belt
ing the Bruins twice, 45-32 and 49-

California were splitting a pair of
contests. Center John Ball was
again hot and scored 43 points in
, the two games to pull within 15
points of Luisetti for the conference
lead. Hank was held to 16 points
in these two games.
The next week the Golden Bear
rose up again to beat the favored
j Stanford varsity to the tune of 63-
I 30. Luisetti scored half of his team's
> points. The loss again put Stanford
I into a tie with U.S.C.
Then came the all-important Tro-

I in a tie, however, by splitting the
two games. The Trojans won the
first 45-36, but the Indians came
j back to win the Saturday night
| game 46-42, as Luisetti scored 20
j ooints.
Stanford and U.S.C. both won
their last game the next Friday to
finish the regular season in a tie
1 with eight wins and four losses. The
! Indians beat Cal 40-26. and South

I 55-28. That win over California

I never allowed Stanford to win more

To play off the tie the Indians met
J the Trojans in a single game in the
Pavilion. Stanford distributed their
points very evenly while Jack Hupp

was still 3 points behind as the game
I ended.
The Indians then got a chance to
turn the tables on the Washington
1 Huskies, the winners of the North
ern Division. This they did in no
uncertain fashion. In the first game
at Seattle Stanford won with a ter
-1 rific scoring barrage. 60-39. Luiset

32 points. The second game in the
Pavilion saw the Cards win again,

Still not through, the Indians
went back to Seattle to play for the
right to go to Madison Square Gar
den and perhaps to the Olympic
j Games in Berlin, but overconfidence
[ caught up with them and the lost
to Oregon State, 33-23.
This concluded a very successful
season, but was just a start for Lui
setti. He had scored 401 points in
26 games, and was well on his way
1 to an all-time scoring record.
Here we are at last, 1936, the first
of a three-year "golden era" of
Stanford basketball supremacy. This
was also the first year of eligibility
of the Farm's all-time great, Angelo
"Hank" Luisetti, who led the Car
dinals to their first championship
in 15 years. The '36 season also
marked the first time since 1921 that
the Indians won more than one
game from the California Bears in
one r.eason.
Luisetti's running mate at the
forward slot was Howell Turner, a
letterman from the 1935 season. At
center was Art Stoefen, and at
guards were Captain "Dinty"
Moore and either Jack Calderwood,
Bob Zonne or Sparky Robertson.
Moore, all-conference the year be

Stanford and U.S.C. both won

! Indians beat Cal 40-26. and South

I Stanford Wins Crucial
To play off the tie the Indians met
J the Trojans in a single game in the
Pavilion. Stanford distributed their
points very evenly while Jack Hupp
| scored 19 for the Tmajns, but U.S.C.
was still 3 points behind as the game
I ended.
The Indians then got a chance to
turn the tables on the Washington
1 Huskies, the winners of the North
ern Division. This they did in no
uncertain fashion. In the first game
at Seattle Stanford won with a ter
-1 rific scoring barrage. 60-39. Luiset
ti again was high point man with
32 points. The second game in the
Pavilion saw the Cards win again,
i 48-38. This time Hank had to be
content with 21 points.
Lost to Oregon State
Still not through, the Indians
went back to Seattle to play for the
right to go to Madison Square Gar
den and perhaps to the Olympic
j Games in Berlin, but overconfidence
[ caught up with them and the lost
to Oregon State, 33-23.
This concluded a very successful
season, but was just a start for Lui
setti. He had scored 401 points in
26 games, and was well on his way
1 to an all-time scoring record.
Here we are at last, 1936, the first
of a three-year "golden era" of
Stanford basketball supremacy. This
was also the first year of eligibility
of the Farm's all-time great, Angelo
"Hank" Luisetti, who led the Car
dinals to their first championship
in 15 years. The '36 season also
marked the first time since 1921 that
the Indians won more than one
game from the California Bears in
one r.eason.
Luisetti's running mate at the
forward slot was Howell Turner, a
letterman from the 1935 season. At
center was Art Stoefen, and at
guards were Captain "Dinty"
Moore and either Jack Calderwood,
Bob Zonne or Sparky Robertson.
Moore, all-conference the year be
fore, was injured a good part of
the 1936 season, however.
Luisetti Sets Record
The Indians started off the year
by subduing College of the Pacific,
71-40. Next came Utah State, and
with the sensational sophomore
scoring 31 points for a new San
Francisco auditorium record, Stan
ford won, 73-34. Then after winning
two more easy victories over Santa
Clara and the Olympic Club, the
Cardinals lost their first two games
of the season to the University of
Washington in Seattle. The Indians
then returned to the Pavilion to de
feat San Jose State, Utah, and Ne
braska, and wind up their pre-sea
son record with seven wins and
two defeats.
Stanford started off the confer
ence season by splitting a pair of
games with the U.C.LA. Bruins.
The Indians won the first contest,
44-30, but the Bruins came back
strong on Saturday to win, 44-37.
The Uclan ace, center John Ball,
scored 36 points for the two games,
while Luisetti countered with 27 for
Stanford.
Beat Cal
The next Friday, the Cards met
California in the first of a four
game series. Playing at home, Stan
ford won in a hard-fought contest,
41-38, as Luisetti again set the scor
ing pace with 22 points.
The following week-end we went
up against the leading Trojans of
U.S.C., and displaced them in the
league lead with two victories. The
first night the Farm team won 32-25,
but the second night was an entirely
different story. With nine minutes
remaining to play, the Trojans had
what looked to be a safe 15-point
lead. However, a certain sophomore
hadn't begun to warm up yet. At
this point he got red-hot and poured
seven straight baskets through the
hemp to «cut the lead to one point.
When the firing had stopped, Stan
ford had won, 51-47, and Luisetti,

I sprained ankle and all, had scored
l 'JO points.
Then came the Bears again, and
our ancient rivals knocked us back
into a tie with the Trojans by win
ning 39-35.
Ball Scores 43 Points
Back to the conference again, the
Indians regained the lead by belt
ing the Bruins twice, 45-32 and 49-
| 35, while California and Southern
California were splitting a pair of
contests. Center John Ball was
again hot and scored 43 points in
, the two games to pull within 15
points of Luisetti for the conference
lead. Hank was held to 16 points
in these two games.
The next week the Golden Bear
rose up again to beat the favored
j Stanford varsity to the tune of 63-
I 30. Luisetti scored half of his team's
> points. The loss again put Stanford
I into a tie with U.S.C.
Then came the all-important Tro-
