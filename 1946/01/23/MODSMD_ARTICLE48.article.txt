Athletic Director A 1 Masters re
turned from the meeting of the
1 N.CAA. with little to say.
With most of the three-day pe
| riod devoted to informal discussions
j among the men in charge of athletic
programs in colleges from coast to
| coast, the meeting produced nothing
sensational. There was little in the
j way of concrete results.
Emphasizes Conditioning
i Keynoting the conference, which
j took place in St. Louis on Feb. 8, 9,
| and 10, were speeches by three gen
erals. "Genera! Donovan gave the
best talk," said Masters. "He em
! phasized the constant need for
j physically conditioned men in peace
as well as war."
In line with the general's ''keep
| the home athletic fields working"
theme, the representatives discussed
ways and means of getting more
j men to enter into active athletic
! competition.
Strengthen Intramurals
Keeping pace with this, Stanford
| has recently strengthened its own
j intramural program, adding more
! promotion and supervision. The
j only definite idea that Mr. Masters
j came back with was that of having
playoffs between the best intramu
; ral teams in each sport from Cal and
| Stanford. This plan proved success
ful at Harvard and Yale, and prob
| ably will be developed soon on the
1 coast.
Informal meetings between the
coaches and athletic directors re
j suited in the exchange of ideas. To
keep contacts and friendships with
men from other parts of the country
is also an essential purpose of the
conclave.
