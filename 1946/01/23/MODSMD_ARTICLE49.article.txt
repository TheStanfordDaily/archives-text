# Baseball Closes 1946 Hall of Fame
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 22 (UP).â€”
Baseball's hall of fame kept its
doors closed today for at least an
other year to all comers, including
the colorful stars of the "turn of
the century era," who were leaders
in the inconclusive balloting by the
Baseball Writers' Association.
Old-timers who had plugged for
the nomination of such stars as
Frank Chance and Johnny Evers of
the famed 1906 Chicago Cubs, Miller
Huggins, the brilliant Yankee load
er, and Ed (Big Moose) Walsh, the
spit-ball pitcher of the Chicago
White Sox, failed again to muster
the necessary strength for their can
did ates.
The writers, who cast 263 ballots,
were unable to cast the 75 per cent
voet necessary for a player to be
elected. Chance, the "peerless lead
er" of the Cubs and anchor man at
first base of the Tinker-to-Evers
to-Chance double play combina
tion, came closest, polling 150 votes.
Chance, who died in Los Angeles
in 1924, was high man for the .sec
ond straight year. This time his
supporters were 47 votes shy,
whereas in the 1946 balloting, seven
more would have elected him.
